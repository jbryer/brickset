<ul><li>Both minifigure's are excellent and look amazing. </li><li>The bugs spaceship is excellent </li><li>good pieces in the set</li></ul>
<h4>Cons </h4><ul><li>The price </li></ul><p>Overall I thought this set was great. The pieces that it&nbsp;comes with are nice, the green blades on the spaceship remind of the insectoids, which is what I think they were going for. the minifigures are excellent. If you were a fan of the insectoids theme I think you'll like this theme. This is a must have for any space collector. If you can get it for a lower price definitely get&nbsp;it, and even&nbsp;if you cant its still a&nbsp;good set for you to get.&nbsp;</p>

"Kalhiki","2013-02-10T16:40:13.977Z","Army Builder","<p>This set caught my eye as one of the better looking Galaxy Squad sets. Plus, my&nbsp;fondness for small-scale sets aided me in the purchasing of it. So how does this nasty little bug add up? &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is small, suitable for a set of the size. As usual you see the shot of the model in action, while the back&nbsp;shows off&nbsp;its (few) features.</p>
<p>The instructions are simple and straight-forward. Not much to go over with them.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are some nice parts in this. I always enjoy transparent parts and in this set we get the nice transparent green wings (the kind that flouresce which is just plain lovely), and the red cockpit. Not to mention some trans pink and red studs. There's also the Alien Conquest double-barrel pistols (here used on the blue robot's jetpack), some nice lime green bricks, and those tri-rod connecter pieces (don't know how to describe them. They were used on the hands of the Ninjago Dragons to connect the claws (in this set, they're used to connect the legs)).</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The Blue Robot: This guy isn't half bad. Not my favorite 'bot out of all the teams, but he looks pretty cool. However, I feel the jetpack could've been more creative in design. Luckily, this is partly made up just due to the sheer awesomeness of the minifig's gun. It's a massive cannon, and I love it. My only complaint about the minifig overall in the head (and this goes for all the robots in Galaxy Squad). I really would have liked it to be a helmet instead of it just being a head. A helmet would be more versatile.</p>
<p>The Bug: We also get one of the roach/pillbug/whatever minifigs. Very cool looking guy what with his layered armor design on his body and molding on his head. Not to mention his four eyes and mandibles. Not much else to be said except he also comes with a gun, but it's the same kind introduced in Alien Conquest.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build is quick and simple as a small set should be. There really isn't anything special going on though, but it was fun nonetheless. And the fact that there are no stickers is just an added bonus.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The model is fantastic. I've been having a lot of fun with this little guy. Since it's so small it's easy to transport and carry around with you. The wings are hinged and can rotate to allow you to&nbsp;put them in some decent poses. Only issue with&nbsp;the wings is that the gun also stores back there, which can get in the way of one of the wings. Not to bad, though as long as you have&nbsp;them angled out. </p>
<p>I've been having lots of fun with the grabbing mouth feature as&nbsp;well, which can hold onto minifigs.&nbsp;Though I prefer to shove the vehicles from the Tower Bridge set&nbsp;into it. And finally, there's the legs which I'm quite pleased to say can support the set quite well and sturdily.</p>
<p>There's only one complaint, however, and that's the price.&nbsp;Around twelve bucks is quite expensive for what you get. I was going to&nbsp;rate the value a three, but I feel&nbsp;that the higher price is compensated for with the amount of playability it has. It's a simple little set, and that's what makes it great. It doesn't need any fancy gimmicks. It's just a cool model to mess around with or display. Honestly, I'd like to get at least two more just to have a little army, but that'll probably wait until a sale.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, this is a fantastic model. Build is fun, Minifigs are great, and the Space Swarmer itself is a marvel. Despite a rather high price, I feel that what it offers in all is well worth it. This is a must for Space and Sci-fi&nbsp; fans. I highly recommend picking it up with an overall score of 5/5.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"icepick","2013-01-03T13:39:43.03Z","Very fun set","<p>Love this set. Really excited to pick up a few more of the galaxy squad stuff.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>Colors are really hard to tack down, but the part count is low enough that you just find the piece and don't worry about color.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Love the stuff it comes with. Great parts. Great colors. Couldn't be more happy here.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Robot's head is a little small, but overall both are stunning. The Attention to detail is nice. There's a bit of misprint on the android, but it doesn't ruin it for me.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Fun and fast. Not difficult at all except for the above mentioned flaws in the instructions.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I find it to be very swooshable. Not a ton of playability, but just the right amount to really have fun.<br></p>
<h4>Value</h4><p>Probably a little steep. But only by a dollar or so. Don't let it put you off.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

"redbeardlegoman","2018-01-07T01:16:09.27Z","For The Swarm!","<p>When this series came out, I was in tough financial times.&nbsp; I loved the look of it, but could barely afford any Lego, and made different choices.&nbsp; However, now that things are a bit better, I&#39;m starting to finally get into it.&nbsp; So please accept this review on a five-year-old series as the musings of a fan who&#39;s&nbsp;finally acquiring his longed-for sets.<br />
<br />
<strong>Summary</strong><br />
<br />
I can think of few sets more ideally suited to army building than this zippy little beauty.&nbsp; And that&#39;s taking both sides of the battle into consideration.<br />
<br />
<strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
<br />
The instructions are fairly clear.&nbsp; The box holds the goods.<br />
<br />
<strong>Parts</strong><br />
<br />
I love the two printed tiles - the controls and the mouth piece.&nbsp; The controls have a wonderful sci-fi movie/video game quality that really sells the immersion into this theme&#39;s story.&nbsp; I can so clearly see the Buggoid&nbsp;targetting&nbsp;the human and robot opposition in The Galaxy Squad.<br />
<br />
The colour scheme for the Buggoids&nbsp;is great.&nbsp; I love the bright yellowish green and dark red, with hints of trans red, green and pink.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; Likewise, the Galaxy Squad are decked out in several different colour schemes, all of which work well, with blue represented here.</p>

<p><strong>Minfigures</strong></p>

<p>Neither of these two figures have the typical human head.&nbsp; The alien&#39;s is very interesting.&nbsp; When removed from the body, it could work very well on its own as a coiled larva.&nbsp; The robot has a wonderfully sculpted and asymmetric head.&nbsp; It puts me in mind of the Battle Beast figures that I loved and collected in my 80s childhood.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s nice that while there are &quot;human&quot; minifigures in the theme, that there is at least one that stands without any human assistance.&nbsp; And it&#39;s good to see that there are many more robots among the Galaxy Squad ranks.</p>

<p>Both minifigures have a lot of detailing, both in sculpts and printing, that make them interesting and enjoyable.&nbsp; I find myself holding them and examining all of the well-executed details.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The builds are both simple, but fun.&nbsp; More often than not, minifigures get an accessory or two, but not much more than that.&nbsp; But our stalwart robo-hero&nbsp;gets a jet pack and a fierce looking hand cannon.</p>

<p>The Swarmer itself quickly comes together, and you&#39;re ready to play within 10 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>Can&#39;t you just see several dozen (or hundred, depending on your budget) of these Swarmers&nbsp;flying around a larger phalanx of Warp Stingers, or flanking a few Hive Crawlers, facing down a Galactic Titan and whole platoons of the heavily-armed Blue Robots?&nbsp; I can.&nbsp; This set practically begs you to do just that.&nbsp; The insectile nature of the alien races is particularly well reflected in this delightful ship.&nbsp; Standing on my table with the wings akimbo, mandibles open, I can almost imagine that it&#39;s swaying like a fly or wasp, preparing to strike deep and hard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m probably going to buy a few more parts to give it six legs, instead of the four it comes with.&nbsp; I&#39;m happy enough with the three mandibles, however, as I think more would make it too front-heavy.<br />
<br />
The blaster storage in the back is handy, but it does interfere with the ability of the nearby wing to fold flat.&nbsp; However, it&#39;s an acceptable compromise in my eyes.&nbsp; You could always just stuff the blaster into the head rest area of the cockpit if it really bothers you.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>We all salivate for the larger sets, budgetting and planning and dreaming.&nbsp; We take the medium and smaller sets as great filler, or nice cheap salvos into untried themes and sub-themes.&nbsp; This small set, however, is an unexpected star - a scene stealer.&nbsp; It&#39;s full of character and charm in an economy of parts.&nbsp; It becomes one that I think perfectly lends itself to army building, or swarm building as it were.</p>

<p>Others have said it&#39;s a bit expensive.&nbsp; I&#39;m from Canada, where everything is more expensive than in the US, so meh.&nbsp; Five years on, I got it at a nice discount.&nbsp; If I could, though, I&#39;d pick up many of these as wonderful support units for a full-on alien invasion.</p>
