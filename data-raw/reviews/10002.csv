"just2good","2012-12-01T21:37:05.087Z","The hidden gem of the Galaxy Squad theme?","Hello, just2good here (previously known as 'Missingno' on this site) with my review of one of the newest sets, the Galaxy Squad Warp Stinger.<br><br>This set was released yesterday <a href=""http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Warp-Stinger-70702"">on LEGO S@H</a> and at LEGO stores. It is also <a href=""http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=17328416"">listed on Toys""R""Us.com</a>, but is unavailable at the moment. It retails for $30 in the United States, and $40 in Canada. It is yet to be released in the Eastern World. It contains 310 pieces and some extras.<br><br>To start, the building experience was long and even tedious at points. There are 12 stickers in this set, so beware. The cockpit was fun to build, and the same goes for the small Galaxy Squad's ship included with the set. The set itself has a few NPUs (nice piece use), notably using the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=3464"">Technic wheel-barrow piece</a> as a double sided stud, and making the alien's gun out of <a href=""www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=30169"">a scorpion</a>, <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=4740"">a dish</a>, and <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=4528"">a frying pan</a>. The mosquito ship tail was very tedious and repetitive to build, though.<br><br>There are quite a few great uncommon pieces in this set. <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=57906"">Four 1x12 hinge plates in trans-neon green</a>, a<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=87752""> two trans-red bubble canopy</a>, the <a href=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/grogall/Galaxy-Squad/70702/e_70702_detail_3.jpg"">new alien capture pod</a> (this set is the cheapest way to get it), <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=6239&amp;colorID=59&amp;in=A"">five dark red shuttle tails</a>, six 2x3 lime green hood-like pieces which I THINK are new, and a <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=3464"">Technic wheel-barrow piece</a>, just to name a few. Then there is the minifigures. Wow. This is probably the best trio of minifigures since the Doc-Ock Ambush set (also $30). The robot figure is great. It has unique torso printing and a great new head piece. Then there is the red Galaxy Squad commander figure. He uses a unique red colored <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=87781"">helmet originally from the second wave of Space Police 3</a>, and new torso printing along with the same leg printing as the robot from the site. Finally, there is the mosquito alien figure. He strikes quite a resemblance to my favorite figure of all time, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=toy007"">Twitch from the Toy Story 3 sets</a>. He uses all new atena pieces (a slight variation from the ones on Twitch), a new wing piece, a new head piece, and new printing on his torso and legs.<br><br>There is only a few playability features in this set. A <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemPic.asp?P=64275"">ball shooter</a> play feature is included in the set. You can take apart the tail from the cock pit and make it a separate ship. There are a few hinge plates which can be <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=57906"">flapped up and down</a>. Sadly, that is all of the intended play features. Then again, the cock pit and mini-Galaxy Squad ship are swooshable, so that is a plus on playability.<br><br>Finally, the set all together looks great in person. It is a great display piece. The whole set itself lies on its tail, so the legs are pointless and are only for looks. I have seen some people complaining about the legs, so they will be happy as they are 100% removable and the set does not rely on them. The Galaxy Squad mini-ship is cute, but looks pretty pathetic next to the alien's ship.<br><br>Overall, this might be my favorite Galaxy Squad set so far. It is affordable (and has a great PPP ratio), the figures and pieces are exceptional, and the ship looks really good. I would pick this set up over the $20 and $40 Galaxy Squad sets if you want a medium-sized cheap set.<br><br><b>9/10</b><br><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIzrK6C0hZk""><br>Watch my video review of this set on YouTube, which is hands on and more detailed</a>.<br><br><br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

"Dragon_Master_48","2012-12-28T17:14:02.427Z","Good, even as a first set to this theme!","<p><strong>70702 Warp Stinger</strong>&nbsp;is a neat set for its price.&nbsp;Even though this is the first set I own in the new Galaxy Squad theme, it serves as a nice introduction to the theme; it&#39;s all that it seems to be.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to call particular attention to the build and final product of this set; although I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m usually a fan of creature-themed vehicles, this vehicle pulls the look of perfectly and even somewhat humorously. Although it can be repetitive at times, I think the construction of the segments isn&#39;t tedious enough to consider this a major con; the way it builds up into the overall appearance is fun enough to experience.</p>

<p>The hero&#39;s vehicle isn&#39;t much, but it&#39;s a neat little build, and the fact that you get two figures for their side balances things out. All of the figures in this set are great, especially the Mosquitoid. The quality of these figures is complemented by the variety of parts in this set. Not only do you get a vibrant range of color, but you get weapons for the minifigures which are excellent parts- both the robot&#39;s blade weapons, and Billy Starbeam&#39;s&nbsp;blasters. The pod which attaches to the alien vehicle (in a neat purple, by the way) has a nice, creepy, insect-like texture, which perfectly represents what it should be.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Amazing build; looks like a bug, of course!</li>
	<li>Cockpit is cool; it uses the &quot;glass&quot; pieces masterfully.</li>
	<li>Great minifigures.</li>
	<li>Shooter is a good extra for more play value.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Slightly repetitive build. Not too major of a con, however.</li>
	<li>Without the arms, it gets off balance easily.</li>
	<li>You can&#39;t adjust the &quot;tail&quot; of the vehicle, something that would make this set even better.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this set is rather decent. If you like this set from appearances, you will most likely stick with your opinion after purchase, and visa-versa. In many ways, this theme does capture the feeling of more classic themes like Insectoids and Mars Mission, something that can especially be seen in this set.</p>

"Squidtron","2012-12-26T12:35:20.057Z","A Good Buy for MOCers","<h4>Pieces</h4><p>The pieces in this set are excellent for MOCers. The colors are interesting: lime green, dark tan, and dark red. Most of the lime green parts and a couple of the dark red parts are smoothly curved bricks, which would be great for streamlining. The dark tan pieces are mostly plates and would be perfect for landscaping. The translucent green fins look good, but probably wouldn't be that great for building. The most interesting pieces are the two that make of the purple prison pod. While they are cool looking, I can't see how they would be using in MOCing. This set is also a great source of SNOT pieces (it comes with 12 of <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=99781"">these thingies</a>!)<br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures on this set are some of the best I've ever seen. The mosquito is very well done. The head of it is excellently molded and looks really cool. The wings are awesome, they have a hexagonal pattern on them which shifts as you look at them from different angels. Its body and legs are similar. They are both olive green and dark with armor printed on them. His gun is interesting. It is made of a scorpion, a frying pan, and a translucent pink dish. <br></p><p>The robot is also awesome. The head, like the mosquito's, is excellent. It also has a multi-part jetpack. The torso and legs have a grey and red robotic armor pattern on them. Its weapons are awesome. They are translucent blue blades with serration on the underside. The person isn't that interesting. He has an armor pattern printed on his torso and legs which will be uninteresting for people who have a significant space collection. His helmet is the same mold as the ADU minifigs, but it is red. <br></p><h4>Build</h4><p>The head of the bug thing is fun to build, but the tail construction is repetitive. The construction of the little Galaxy Squad vehicle is uninteresting, but not too bad for such a small vehicle. <br></p><h4>Final Product</h4><p>The finished build is worth the repetitive build. The bug vehicle looks awesome, but is disappointingly is not very flexible. The legs look rather silly, but would be better if they were flexible.&nbsp; The ball shooter is fun, but the lack of flexibility ruins the play experience. Also, you can trap a minifigure in the purple pod attached to the back of the bug's head, but it's a little difficult to put the two halves of it together.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is a great set. The pieces and minifigures are great. The playability isn't great, so it's probably not a good buy if you're not into MOCing. <br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,2,4
"Harmonious_Building","2013-05-23T15:01:08.157Z","Bug buzz. ","Those who are fans of LEGO Space have surely felt somewhat neglected over the past decade or so. With the introduction of the now-ubiquitous Star Wars theme, Space has long since taken a back seat in favour of its shiny and highly-profitable licensed counterpart, and it probably says something that the past three Space subthemes - <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Space%20Police%203"">Space Police</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Alien%20Conquest"">Alien Conquest</a>, and now Galaxy Squad - are reboots of a sort to three pre-Star Wars subthemes - <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Space%20Police%202"">Space Police</a> (obviously), <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=UFO"">UFO</a>, and <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Insectoids"">Insectoids</a>. It's hard to say how much of a coincidence this is, but my completely unqualified opinion says that it is not.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I feel that the Insectoids were a sort of polarising theme to begin with, especially since they hail from an era where LEGO was sort of fixated on using giant, pre-fabricated pieces, and the Insectoids theme was pretty guilty of that. I still like the subtheme, though, because they always stand out to me as one of the most charismatic of the ""evil"" Space races, given the distinctive look and feel of their models. I believe it was also the last major Space subtheme to be released before LEGO Star Wars was put out in full force, so there is a sort of swan song kind of nostalgia to them as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, bugs are now apparently back in vogue, and Warp Stinger is among the largest pieces that the bug aliens (is there an official name for them?) have in their arsenal. For US$30, you get three detailed Minifigs (the bug is my favourite, of course), a tiny and sticker-laden scout ship of sorts for the titular Galaxy Squad, and an immense bug-ship for your alien fleet. It's not a bad deal, but especially so if you can get it on discount at Amazon, which is what I was able to do.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The ""good"" Minifigs are more or less a bonus here, though I am perplexed at LEGO's decision to give each of the bug-hunting Galaxy Squads a different primary colour. Except for the printing, the human Minifigs are nearly identical to the Space Minifigs from the past five years or so, which is good in the sense that one can easily integrate the Earth Defense Force and others into one's squad, if one desires. To add some variety, LEGO has conjured up an interesting cyborg soldier to throw into the mix. I find them to be a bit strange, but I guess others might find them appealing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The bug Minifig, on the other hand, is just great. LEGO has stripped away the cybernetic pretenses put up by the Insectoids and given us just plain old bugs, which are absolutely great, especially if you want to have a go at recreating scenes from <i>The Fly</i>. I believe that this set is thus far the cheapest way of getting the ""mosquito"" Minifig, so that's a plus too.</div><div><br></div><div>The little hovering machine thing for the human Minifig is almost not worth mentioning, so much so that I would advise against placing the stickers on it and cannibalise it for parts instead. The Warp Stinger itself, on the other hand, is such a neat build that one can't help but be surprised once it's all done (being vaguely reminiscent of the <a href=""http://starcraft.wikia.com/wiki/Mutalisk"">Mutalisk</a> from <i>StarCraft </i>will surely be of great appeal to fans of that series). What surprised me was how large the final build comes out to be and also how sturdy and stable it is - judging from the pictures, I imagined that one would be forced to balance it precariously on the two strange ""legs"", when in reality it is perfectly capable of standing up without them. Unfortunately, with sturdiness comes a near-complete lack of flexibility, and I was a little disappointed to learn that the sections of the body do not move. This makes it better as a display model than as a playable one, since the only real gimmick is the ""ball launcher"" thingy that acts as its tail (do NOT let kids put the ball in their mouth). It makes me wonder, then, if the purpose of the Warp Stinger is to actually fly through space or if it kind of remains stationary as a sort of anti-ground turret or something.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you're a fan of quirky-looking Space models, you'll probably get a lot of joy out of Warp Stinger, and you might even learn a thing or two from how it's built, too. It's also a very nice homage to the Insectoids - in my opinion - so if you liked that subtheme, this will probably appeal to you as well. The question remains as to what remake is in the pipeline next - <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Space&amp;subtheme=Ice%20Planet%202002"">Ice Planet</a>, perhaps? Now that would be interesting.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4

<p>If you want this color scheme. Get a different set. Or a Ninjago Snake set. There is at&nbsp;least some fun packed in the box with those. Get this one only at deep discount. and then only if there is nothing else good on offer. In a few years this will be nobodies favorite.&nbsp;</p>
