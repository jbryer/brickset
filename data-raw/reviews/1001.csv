<p>This set isn&#39;t much when it comes to building stuff. There isn&#39;t actually much to build. But that&#39;s is OK, because this set is all about play and imagination. Even as an adult I enjoy myself shooting those clowns out of the cannon. The mechanism is very simply,&nbsp;easy to use and&nbsp;works perfectly.</p>

<p>The clowns look amazing, although it might have been a tad better iff they actually had different looks instead of simply color-swaps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car and motorcycle are great, and so is the nice addition of the umbrellalalala. When combined with other circus themed sets, this nice little clown-pack will offer endless times of fun and entertainment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Come to think: when is LEGO going to do an&nbsp;actual Circus City- theme?</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>-great fun and play<br />
-everything works as it should<br />
-nice bright colors</p>

<p>CONS<br />
<br />
-none :D</p>
