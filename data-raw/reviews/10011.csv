My highlights are the sliding prison gates for the inmates, the dog's pen and bowl, the sliding garage doors for the nice police vans and lots of other little idiosyncrasies. <br><br>Real value for money, I got it brand new for Â£50 off eBay.<br><br>Plenty of spare parts, in-depth instructions and looks great in any budding Lego City.<br><br>Here is a photo of the main body of the set, which I've just constructed today.<br><br>http://www.flickr.com/photos/91736360@N05/8342132229/<br><br>Note the 2 incandescent inmates stuck in their cells!<br><br>Enjoy!<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
