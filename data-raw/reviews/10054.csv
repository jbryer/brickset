"Superleeroy","2012-12-29T13:19:19.693Z","Great Addition To Any Lego Batman Collection","<p>I had decided to start collecting the Lord Of The Rings sets when I saw this pop up on the Lego website. Needless to say it made me question my priorities and I knew I had to have it. </p><p>When it arrived, I was surprised at how big the box was. I opened it up to find 11 bags of pieces inside, three manuals and a small sticker sheet. The small sticker sheet is the first of my pros. It's nice for such a large set to have such a small number of stickers and they're only used for computer screens and the such-like. </p><p>The manuals are very easy to follow but with this set I found the first printing error I'd encountered in a Lego manual. On page 58 of book 3, two steps are the wrong way round. It's such a minor gripe but it confused me for a second as I thought I'd missed something. </p><p>The attention to detail is fantastic even down to Harley Quinns dressing table. The build itself was quite fun and not too repetitve. It took me around 3-4 hours. </p><p>Onto the minifigures. These are what tipped me in favour of buying it to begin with. The best way to describe the selection of characters on offer would be to say they are gap fillers. If you have one or two characters missing, they might be in this set. You get Batman, Robin, Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Joker, Penguin, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy and Arkham Guard. They're all great and the detail is pinpoint. I also like that Dr. Quinzel comes with a second face and the Harley hat to become Harley Quinn. There's even a hint of the Harley costume under her doctor's garb. The new look Robin is quite cool and the Joker looks pretty&nbsp;cool in his nice orange jumpsuit.&nbsp;If there was one character I'd say could've been in this set and isn't, I'd say Commissioner Gordon.</p><p>Overall I'd say this set could probably have been a little cheaper. Perhaps shave&nbsp;Â£20 off the price but I'm not complaining too much for what you get in the box. It's not just the Asylum (which&nbsp;looks great by the way), but also a&nbsp;patient transport&nbsp;van and the main gates to Arkham. Both of which add playabilty to an already fun set.&nbsp;</p><p>So as far as this collector is concerned, a good job. If they could do more sets like this, I'd happily part with my well-earned cash. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"ontherocks68","2013-02-04T17:54:53.783Z","One of the best sets I've built!","<p>I picked this set up just after Christmas and could not be more impressed.&nbsp; The details on the Arkham Asylum just don't end.&nbsp; The building itself looks every bit as gothic and creepy as you would want it to, from the tips of the roof spires to the gargoyles overlooking the the corners.&nbsp; The gate and ambulance look great next to the building as well.&nbsp; </p><p>The figure assortment is excellent, with the orange jumpsuit Joker and Harley Quinn in disguise fitting in nicely.&nbsp; I also liked the decision to include extra features to integrate villains from other sets into the Asylum.&nbsp; There's a holding chamber and prison plaque for Mr. Freeze as well as a Two-Face plaque.&nbsp; </p><p>The stickers won't ever be anyone's favorite feature but there aren't too many and they do add nicely to the set.&nbsp; The instructions were very clear and, as always, the bags of parts were sorted very well with plenty of extra small bits.&nbsp; At $160 this isn't a cheap set, but it does come in at about #27 on the all-time largest Lego set list, and for what you get I don't feel it's terribly overpriced.&nbsp; </p><p>Overall, this is fun set to build and you won't regret having it look spectacular on your shelf!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

Unfortunately we&rsquo;ve all been swamped with school work. Now then, ahem, take two. This is the definitive DC Super Heroes set from LEGO, even the recently revealed Jokerland cannot honestly compete with what Arkham created. This is why I am going to go over this in painstaking detail and will ensure that you all understand my thoughts and feelings on this set. (Which is even better than the original Arkham Asylum set from LEGO Batman.)</span></span></span></span></p>

The big difference you&rsquo;ll find is the size, this is one pretty impressively sized box. Especially considering the contents.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Showcasing this set isn&rsquo;t difficult, the image on the front of the box does an excellent job of showing off everything this set has to offer.

You also get to see the building from the rear, mind you this is the primary build and not the secondary build, which is not even hinted at by advertising the modular design options of the model. Still that can be forgiven.</span></span></span></span></p>

The manuals follow along with the steps quite nicely and you can easily see what needs to go where during the build, there are no spots that would trip up experienced builders, certain younger builders may need help though in some of the areas. (Especially the jail cells on the lower floor as getting your fingers inside there once the roof is on can be difficult.)</span></span></span></span></p>

Way to many to list properly, however I will say this. If you&rsquo;re not interested in the main build of this model for whatever reason you&rsquo;re getting a lot of bricks and other decent parts for MOCing a gothic looking Halloween themed mansion&hellip; Addams Family perhaps. The numerous large plates are a big draw to this set as well, plus the black roof pieces and the dark grey frogs are awesome.</span></span></span></span></p>

He also gets the Batarang accessory, not much else to say.</span></span></span></span></p>

Again a great looking figure. No accessories unfortunately.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall it&rsquo;s not a bad looking Minifigure, however there isn&rsquo;t much to discuss when there are so many more impressive figures in the set. He has no official accessories, as he is meant to be the driver of the van and the guard posted at the security station inside Arkham.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her hair piece has some great printing with leaves and her face has a suitable expression.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Robin: This version of Robin is identical to past versions, the printing and the facial expressions are all the same, the difference here is the use of a black hood piece instead of hair. He&rsquo;s wearing his standard cloth cape piece and is given a long rod as an accessory to prevent the breakout at Arkham.</span></span></span></span></p>

Naturally he has no accessories, being behind bars at Arkham means all of his usual tricks have been confiscated, which just means he needs to make up brand new ones.</span></span></span></span></p>

His face is naturally one-sided with a great expression and he includes an umbrella and a fish to throw at someone, odd weapons, but The Penguin always was a bit odd.</span></span></span></span></p>

His head is more of a burlap bag style mask with a very creepy expression and he&rsquo;s got the standard witch/wizard hat for his head gear. He and the Penguin have orchestrated an escape and one of the windows has been destroyed, allowing for him to climb out while the Penguin distracts the guard. He has no accessories unfortunately, it would have been nice to get a fear gas canister for him to use once he get&rsquo;s free.</span></span></span></span></p>

This build is very impressive, in spite of the stickers used for the detailing. This build doesn&rsquo;t have any tricky bits, and includes some nice elements. It is just as satisfying as the main build. And once it&rsquo;s finished you get a vehicle to add to your Gotham City display that is both iconic, and sorely needed because by this point you&rsquo;ve got about way too many Bat Vehicles and nothing GPD to put on display.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: Batman is included in this bag. The build from this bag is the opening gates, which are a slightly weaker build. It&rsquo;s not a bad build, unfortunately it can suffer a bit of a flimsy fall-apart nature due to the very nature of the model. It&rsquo;s also quite repetitive and I would recommend building it on a hard flat surface if you&rsquo;d prefer not having parts pop off at random intervals while handling the pieces during the build. The gates themselves are suitably gothic looking though, but we&rsquo;ll get to that in the completed model section.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 3: It&rsquo;s The Penguin, his first appearance in the new DC Super Heroes Theme. This build involves the first section of the ground floor of Arkham with the front entrance and the guard station. This build also requires a flat surface to build, it&rsquo;s not something you can just put together on your bed or something. Making the front entrance is really fun, the stairs leading up to the door are pretty clever looking and the security guard station would be awesome if it didn&rsquo;t include stickers. The light fixtures are awesome too and a clever little build. It&rsquo;s not too difficult to follow along with what goes where, and once you finish it you&rsquo;re ready for&hellip;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 4: This bag gives you Robin and the upper floor of the main entrance area. Which is a patient examination room. The build starts in manual one, with a few elements including the large windows&hellip; which I will say here can be a bit tricky to get to line up just right as you attach them to the base of the second floor. Carrying on into manual two you finish off the outer wall of the second floor and then move on to the furniture and equipment inside the patient treatment/examination area. Each aspect of this build is very impressive, the medical desk with the open drawer is a very clever looking build and it&rsquo;s nice to see them give us more of the LEGO syringes in this bag. The couch/experimentation table is a fun looking build too and almost sinister in nature when you consider what it&rsquo;s used for.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 5: You&rsquo;ll find the Scarecrow minifigure in this bag and the ground floor where the jail cells are located. The only real trouble with this build is the lack of space for larger hands, even semi-small hands will start to have issues getting parts to attach as the roof is formed, there isn&rsquo;t much to build once you get the roof on, mostly the playability is hindered due to the condensed nature of this build. I think the jail cells could have used a wider baseplate and more space opened up.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 6: It&rsquo;s Poison Ivy in this bag and the upper floor of the jail cells which includes Ivy&rsquo;s personal greenhouse style prison. Nothing too difficult in this section of the build, however I will again bring up the tricky nature of getting the windows to line up right when you build them and attach them to the main section of the model. This build carries us through to the end of the manual and finishes it off nicely.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 7: Starting off manual 3 is the final section of the jail cells portion of the model. This one doesn&rsquo;t feature any minifigures, because the cell you&rsquo;re building here is specifically designed to hold Mr. Freeze. It&rsquo;s a fairly short build with, again, stickers for detail and in it you get to build a really nice looking stained glass window. You also get to build a nice looking gothic roof with stone gargoyles and other accessories, it&rsquo;s not that difficult and finishes off this section of the model which will attach to the security station build you did previously with Technic Pins.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 8: Dr. Harleen Quinzel is in this bag along with the third and final section of the ground floor of the asylum. This is a combination vanity for Harleen with a hidden security station to monitor the other inmates of Arkham on file. It&rsquo;s a fast and fun little build of the Arkham building, the only flaw in it will be discussed more in detail in the completed model section.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 9: We&rsquo;re coming down to the end, here is where you build Harleen&rsquo;s office, with a desk and chair and the other section of the gothic roof. There is no ceiling here, but another one of those tricky window builds we&rsquo;ve seen in other sections. The build for the chair and desk is just really fun microbuilding and extremely impressive detailed designs. Once you finish this bag you&rsquo;re done, attach the section to the rest of Arkham and that&rsquo;s the end.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Before we discuss everything about the main build let&rsquo;s go over the main gate and Arkham transport van. The van is a very nice looking model, despite the use of stickers for details it works quite well as a prisoner transport vehicle, with a stretcher in the back to secure the prisoners. It works very well for play and makes a great display piece. The main gate is a bit of a weaker additional model, while the overall design and look of the main gate is suitably impressive and gothic, the plain fact of the matter is it&rsquo;s far too flimsy. It flops around whenever you pick it up to move it for the main display, and the lack of a proper plate to affix it to means that it will easily fall apart. This is due to the weight of the side-sections for the gate where the two angelic looking statues are, if you don&rsquo;t pick it up with two hands it collapses easily. An unfortunate design flaw.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Arkham Asylum is designed as a modular building, because of this you can have two separate configurations for the model, each of which has its pros and cons. The main configuration turns out as mostly a fa&ccedil;ade with the front of the building having all of the detail work while the rear of building is a large open space, there is still a lot of internal detailing, but this configuration of the model limits the way it can be displayed and played with. Though it does give all access to the interior for playing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The secondary configuration is slightly more closed and makes for a much better display piece when compared to the more open fa&ccedil;ade, the younger builders will prefer the fa&ccedil;ade that let&rsquo;s for greater access to the features. The older display oriented fans will prefer this configuration as it compacts better when placed on the shelf. Both configurations however still look gorgeous.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The play features of the model are very ingenious, most of them are simple little things, an opening front door, a small jail cell off to one side with space for two characters, Harley Quinn&rsquo;s special hiding place where she can change from Dr. Quinzel into her alter ego, a plant cell where Poison Ivy can be kept, another cell for Mr. Freeze and an examination room where Dr. Quinzel interrogates and examines The Joker.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The main model of Arkham looks great, it is full of so many intricate designs it would be difficult to go over all of them, however some stand out elements for me are the methods for constructing the windows, especially Mr. Freeze&rsquo;s window which captures the look of a stained glass window covered over in a nice layer of frosted ice. The balcony with the gargoyles and other classic gothic architecture elements are a real treat as well. Harley&rsquo;s office is a great looking internal space with loads of personality and detailing. Her desk for instance is a stand out part of the build for me, and the entire examination room is just fun to look at.</span></span></span></span></p>

The original Arkham Asylum was a set that relied much more on play features and elements that sacrificed the look of the overall model, this updated version is worlds above what came before. The execution of the design and build for the structure is a massive step up and quite appealing.

It is only on the secondary market now as it has been retired, so expect to pay a considerable amount should you want this, but it is well worth any price for what you get.</span></span></span></span></p>

You get a dual-sided face (Doctor/Harley Quinn face) and on her torso, beneath her white coat, you can see a hint of her Harley Quinn red &amp; black costume.</div><div>2) Robin has a hoodie and (I didn't notice on pictures before) a short cape.</div><div>3) [Frustration] Instead of a random guard, why not include a new minifig like Aaron Cash (the guard who got one hand bitten off by Killer Croc), this would have been very cool.</div><div>4) [Frustration] Why put a special cold room for Freezer if you don't include him in the box, this means that if you want to have the right character in that specific room, you need to also get the set 76000.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Building experience 5/5</b></div><div>I built the set yesterday, it took me about 3h45'. It came in 9 bags, building first the van, then the portal, then the asylum itself which is divided in three parts: the entrance, the cells and the Harley Quinn's make-up room (Those three parts can be attached in two different way making the frontage be only one-sided or in a L-form). It didn't feel repetitive except for the window and details (which were little parts, quite painful for my fingers). There's wasn't too much stickers for the size of it (note: the ""Arkham Asylum"" sign is actually two stickers).</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall 5/5</b></div><div>This set is a must have because it's simply the largest set ever released under the Super Heroes category, because it has 5 villains included and because of the awesome look of it (as said in the official video&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_VgtqS6cCY"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_VgtqS6cCY</a>, it's the first time we see a gothic-styled building in a Lego product). This Arkham Asylum is very well designed, I recommend buying it for any Lego Super Heroes fan or if you like dark buildings like the [10228 Haunted House].</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
"Brick_Builder_Hero","2014-08-17T17:40:57.973Z","An Excellent Redesign!","<p>When I saw this on the lego shop site&nbsp;a couple of years ago, I could barely resist it. It was just amazing and I knew it was important to pick it up. I eventually got it for Christmas with the Batcave, which made twice as awesome.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is huge (maybe even bigger then the one for the new tumbler) and it includes 3 instruction booklets.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The parts were chosen really well for this and mostly includes many small pieces for the decorational architecture.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The minifigures are great! I love the redesign for Penguin, Scarecrow, and Robin. Dr. Harleen Quinzel&nbsp;has a pretty nice design with her double-sided head, one side of which features her makeup and eye mask. Poison Ivy isn&#39;t any different from the 2012 version and the guard is the same as the bank guard. Batman has the same black suit but with black gliding wings.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fun build. First you build the van, then you build the gate, and finally the asylum. The Asylum is&nbsp;split into three detachable sections so you can rearrange it into a different asylum. First you build the entrance where the front desk and medical treatment room are, then you build the side with all the prison cells, and then finally you build the smallest&nbsp;section where&nbsp;Harleen Quinzel&#39;s&nbsp;office and make-up mirror are.&nbsp;I think it took me about 2 to 6 hours to complete. I remember starting late at night and building back and forth while playing scrabble, and then working on it the next morning and maybe late afternoon.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The completed model looks fantastic.</p>

<p>Issues</p>

<p>1. Why are there name plates for Freeze and Ivy for the bottom cells when the have their own special ones</p>

<p>2. Only one guard and he is the exact same as the bank guard.</p>

<p>3. No&nbsp;searchlight on roof.</p>

<p>4.And my biggest issue, A PERFECT&nbsp;OPPURTUNITY TO&nbsp;INCLUDE AN ARKHAM CITY BASE BATMAN FIGURE MISSED!!</p>

<p>My overall opinion</p>

<p>Its a really nice set and a must-have&nbsp;for any Bat-fan (even if an Arkham City Batman isn&#39;t included). And I rank this&nbsp;#1 on the&nbsp;Best DC Comics Sets list.</p>

"Fauch","2014-11-30T23:09:51.907Z","Great display","<p>Got this set for about 115 &euro;, without the minifigs.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Too many to remember it all. Most of them are small pieces used for detailing, but it comes with many pillars, an unusually high number of bricks with grove, many prison pieces, tons of weapon, including a very decent amount of spares ones (one claw, 2 handcuffs, 2 axes, and 4(!) sa&iuml;s)&nbsp;and even a spare rope.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very nice build with lots of creative use of bricks, especially for making windows. The stained window is very cool.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The amount of details is impressive, both indoor and outdoor, though the sides are slightly less good than the rest. The alternative build where you put the different section in a L shape is less good, it doesn&#39;t show all the details of the facade as good as the primary design, and makes it harder to play inside.</p>

<p>The model surprisingly doesn&#39;t take that much space, considering the pieces count, but unlike models which are large, but with only a few interesting sections and a lot of filler (seems to be the case with some castles), there&#39;s really no waste of space in this set, there&#39;s a lot going on everywhere, it is&nbsp;a good display, and even the interior would display good as well.</p>

<p>On the minus side, playability isn&#39;t very high, if you consider how much it costs. Of course it comes with batman, robin, and 4/5 baddies which adds a lot to the playability. It also has a truck, but other than that, there isn&#39;t a lot of interaction possible, other than opening some doors, it doesn&#39;t have any really cool function.</p>

<p>Also, a price of 160 or 170&euro; seems a bit high, considering the final model isn&#39;t really bigger than any of the other flagship sets I possess, despite being the only one worth more than 100&euro;. For 115&euro; I think it was a decent deal, although I got no minifigs, but I was more interesting in the details, and it doesn&#39;t need minifigs to look awesome. Moreover there isn&#39;t much space on the facade to display minifigs, so they would mostly be hidden inside.</p>
