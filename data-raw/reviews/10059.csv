<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Wonderful bright colours.</li><li>The figures are very well made.&nbsp; Flounder has such a happy face - my daughter (15mths)shreaks with laughter when she finds him.</li><li>The set has a good number of pieces allowing for 'free play'.</li><li>This is a good set to start younger children on as the large turrets and&nbsp;accessories add interest.</li></ul><p>Cons</p>
<ul><li>The swing is a bit 'fidly' as it does not firmly clip into place and falls out of the cradle when moved around.</li><li>The treasure chest is a nice idea, but it lacks authenticity.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is made of a strange 'gold' plactic that makes the chest appear more like a cheap&nbsp;lucky packet toy.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;design of a proper hinged lid would have been more in keeping with the high standard of quality we have come to expect from Duplo/Lego.</li></ul><p>A lovley set - truely.&nbsp; It is definelty my favourite of the Duplo Disney Princess Range.&nbsp; Expensive, yes...hense my expectation of well designed components, all but the treasure chest.&nbsp; The children love it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
