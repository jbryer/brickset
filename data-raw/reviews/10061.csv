<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It's a train.<br></li><li>It comes with 4 (that's 4!) chassis.</li><li>10 number bricks along with a selection of other useful bricks.<br></li><li>Small boy and his dog to add playability (is that a word?).</li><li>All the above equate to an amazing amount of Lego for the money.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No girl figure.</li><li>Train does not run well on Duplo tracks (it's not designed for that though).<br></li><li>May be a bit advanced for the age range, but a + and - printed brick may have been useful for ambitious parents.</li></ul><p>This is a great entry level set for children who may not have any Duplo already and I really can't stress how good value I think this set is. I have seen it regularly on sale for under Â£10 in the UK and as such had several boxes in the 'secret stash, that is never talked about' ready for rapid deployment. My nephew has one (well he got two at Christmas from two different people), his cousin got one, my cousins son got one (is that my 2nd cousin?). Basically every small child of Duplo age I know has one, as should every other child in the world at this price.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5
