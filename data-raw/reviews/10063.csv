"oldfan","2013-07-25T11:59:54.777Z","Looks good standing still, until you try to move...","Once I decided to start collecting all Octan-related sets, I purchased a copy of 60016 Tanker Truck, the latest in a long line of gas trucks dating back to the old Exxon 554. &nbsp;Tanker design has come a long way in the past few decades! &nbsp;Here are my impressions after building the set:<div><br></div><div>-I like the Octan color scheme. &nbsp;It looks good, with nice contrast (unless you are red-green colorblind, I guess...). &nbsp;Green bricks (well, ""Dark Green"" in official LEGO color nomenclature) are often less common than the same parts in other colors, so Octan sets like this one will have some cool parts, in this case two copies of the lower tank half. &nbsp;The included ""gas pump"" stand follows the same color scheme as the main tanker.</div><div><br></div><div>-As usual, the ""Octan"" flavoring comes from the application of stickers, the bane of my LEGO building. &nbsp;For once, I managed to place the big stickers on the white tank pieces more-or-less on center and level, so the model looks pretty good on display. &nbsp;LEGO continues their tradition of supplying stickers with the model number included, in this case cleverly disguised as the licence plate number (both front and back). &nbsp;I do wish that the green LEGO stickers were a closer color match to the Dark Green bricks; this has been a problem at least since the 7734 Cargo Plane, and the difference in green shades between the stickers and the bricks is just enough to notice, and keeps the parts rating from scoring the maximum 5 points.</div><div><br></div><div>-For once, there is an official LEGO design that does not put a sticker on a 2x4 tile! &nbsp;In this case, a 2x4 white tile is used as the ""roof"" for the gas pump.</div><div><br></div><div>-I don't build much City nowadays, so I was impressed by the solid build of the front and back headlights and taillights. &nbsp;The exhaust stacks are brick-built (sort of) rather than the old custom-built piece found in older sets. &nbsp;The orange lights atop the cab are the much-overused dome lighting pieces that recently appeared; call me old-school, but I'd rather use transparent bricks/plates/tiles for these types of lighting effects; those domes just look out of place on a LEGO model to me (and have limited applications as well). &nbsp;The outer mirrors are efficiently done but look good (maybe white color would be better?). &nbsp;There is plenty of room in the 6-wide City cab for the driver and his coffee mug (included).</div><div><br></div><div>-The greebling throughout the truck is sparse yet effective. &nbsp;The obligatory hose and fire extinguisher storage container are included, and the small valve wheels on the top of the tank itself are a nice touch. &nbsp;The ladder on the back definitely belongs, but ""ladder with double clips"" piece in Medium Stone Gray (Light Bluish Gray to you Bricklinkers) looks oversized and out of place (white and green ladder rungs might have been a better choice, at the cost of using several more parts and bulking out the back of the tanker).</div><div><br></div><div>-As mentioned before, the model looks just fine standing still. &nbsp;But once you start driving the truck down the road, you'll find out quickly that it doesn't turn well at all; the large wheelbase length and 3-axle construction (and those big wide tires) makes it all but impossible to maneuver cleanly on a solid surface like a desktop or the official LEGO streets. &nbsp;For static display, this is not a problem, but if you (or your kids) enjoy racing around their LEGO cars, this model will disappoint. &nbsp;I guess all the trucks of this size need to be a semi-truck design like the previous Octan tanker, 3180, for better playability.</div><div><br></div><div>All in all, it's a great-looking set that will help round out the City displays with all the police and fire units running around. &nbsp;Just don't call on it for a quick emergency refill unless the path to your stranded vehicle is a straight line!</div>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,3
"AndyKbx","2014-07-19T23:48:44.45Z","Great looking model, but has a few deficiencies","<p>As I haven&#39;t yet begun to build my city, I thought long and hard before buying this. In the end it&nbsp;was a spur of the moment decision, but halfway through assembly&nbsp;I was already pleased with my purchase. Its a great looking model, the separate fuel pump being&nbsp;a nice addition.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong>&nbsp; The box contains&nbsp;two parts bags with smaller sleeve of parts inside each, and some useful spares including an extra&nbsp;fuel hose. A useful trick I&nbsp;discovered is to use the keyring sized&nbsp;loyalty cards to open the box, they are very thin, but&nbsp;made from hard plastic, so they&nbsp;cut through the glue joint&nbsp;cleanly, leaving box undamaged.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong> The model is very detailed, with a solid underlying structure. I like parts that&nbsp;make up the tank, very realistic and great use of red plates as a colour contrast. My only complaint is that the fuel hose is too short, wound all the way up it doesn&#39;t get close to filling the reel, unlike what the instructions suggest. I also agree with the other reviewer that playability is a little restricted by fixed axles although this is more than made up for by clever design and use of coloured parts to build a great looking petrol tanker.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong> I would have liked&nbsp;a second minifig, driver provided but Lego missed opportunity to have petrol station attendant perhaps to use the petrol pump for additional&nbsp;playability.</p>

<p><strong>Stickers:</strong>&nbsp;My other slight complaint is that if you want to have more than one tanker truck ,there is no option to vary vehicle number plate. I doubt it would make much difference to production cost, so how about it Lego?</p>

<p><strong>Overall: </strong>Pleased to have added it to my collection, enjoyed the build and&nbsp;a great addition to my collection of vehicles.</p>
