"Dread_Pirate","2012-12-06T22:26:12.337Z","Fun little set!","<p>The delivery man just dropped this off on my porch a few hours ago.&nbsp; I ordered this from Lego <a href=""mailto:S@H"">S@H</a> a few days ago for $19.99 plus the tax and shipping.&nbsp; I could have waited for it to show up at my local toy store for a little less but the VIP points make the couple extra dollars for shipping worth it.</p>
<p>This is the first set I have purchased with Lego's new smaller boxes.&nbsp; I have to say that I am very pleased with the smaller boxes, there is less air room inside and no loss of detail on the box art.&nbsp; The box was still sealed up with the 2 pieces of tape on each end which I like as you can open the boxes without damaging them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Now to the build.</p>
<p>You get 2 books and 2 bags.&nbsp; In the first bag you get a build of the small car and a traffic light on a street corner.&nbsp; The minifig is a female with light brown hair that comes over her shoulder.&nbsp; We have seen this fig's head torso and hair many times before but in this set she has a light brown colored legs that I have not seen before, making this combination unique.&nbsp; The car is a similar build to some of the other 4 lug wide cars we have seen in the past.&nbsp; The colors of the burgandy and dark grey are nice looking together and there is a new nose piece that I have also not seen before.&nbsp; The car is a convertable and sporty looking with the little wing in the back.&nbsp; There is a place behind the seat to store her briefcase, lets just hope she remembers to take it out before the wrecker picks up her car.&nbsp; The traffic light is pretty simple, just a post with a couple 1x1 bricks with the lug on the side.</p>
<p>The Flatbed Wrecker truck is also a fun build.&nbsp; It is not a difficult build and is similar to other of the Great Vehicle sets in the past.&nbsp; It is 6 lugs wide and models a real life wrecker pretty well.&nbsp; The cab doors can open as well as the bed is hinged to assist in lifting the cars onto it.&nbsp; There is a winch that we have seen in a few different sets but this time they have a Technic axle through it so you can wind it up from the side of the truck.&nbsp; On the other end of the winch line is a technic hook&nbsp;that you tie to the string. &nbsp;There are 2 yellow wheel chocks that will help keep the car in place.&nbsp; The minifig in this part of the build is similar to other workers we have seen in the past.&nbsp; He has the ""I have not shaven in a week"" looking face, with a ball cap and his torso is blue with the orange high visiability jacket on, blue legs.&nbsp; This fig is perfect for the set but not unique.&nbsp; The body of the truck is mainly made with the bright orange bricks that look great but are hard to come by.&nbsp; Another new piece is used for the nose of this truck as well.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I like this set all and all.&nbsp; The use of the burgandy and grey in the car and the orange in the truck gives you alot of great pieces to work with in other builds.&nbsp; This is a model of a real life vehicle and something that you and your kids see on the streets all the time all over the world.&nbsp; Playability is high on this set as it will also work with many other of the cars and trucks that kids prolly already have.&nbsp; My son could not wait to get his hands on it after I finished building it.&nbsp; If you are a fan of City this is a great set to get.</p>
<p>I have to give it a 5 for kids, 4 for collectors (the truck driver keeps it from getting a 5) and a 4 for usable pieces (some pieces are only good for other vehicles)</p>

"tomahawker","2012-12-10T23:16:14.203Z","Breakdown, it’s all right","<p class=""MsoNormal"">For 2013 Lego introduces three more realistic vehicles in
the City theme.&nbsp; This series has produced
highly realistic minifig scale vehicles to populate a Lego city at an
affordable $20 price point.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, it seems that the designers have either run out of ideas
or want to reprise sets that sold well in previous years, as two of the three
sets are minor revisions of previous releases.&nbsp;
However, I was delighted when I saw the flatbed (aka breakdown) truck,
and quickly added it to my collection.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>This set is literally like two sets in one box.&nbsp; The box contains separate instruction books
for the car and truck, as well as separate numbered parts bags for each
set.&nbsp; The car is one of the nicest
looking 4-wide vehicles that I have seen Lego produce.&nbsp; The dark red color looks very handsome, and
is a refreshing departure from the usual red, yellow, white, and blue of most
City cars.&nbsp; The design makes use of many
curved slopes and a few unknown parts that may be new or borrow from the Cars
theme.&nbsp; There is also a Brick, Modified 2
x 3 x 2/3 Two Studs, Wing End in black that gives the car a cabriolet
appearance.&nbsp; The only stickers used for
this set are the license plates on the front and rear.&nbsp; I’m assuming the VS initials refer to the
designer, whose name I can’t deduce from these initials.&nbsp; My only disappointment with this vehicle is
the tires and wheels, as they are the same used on the breakdown truck.&nbsp; They are so wide that, along with the wheel
arches, they expand the 4-wide body into a 6-wide track.&nbsp; It’s the one thing that detracts from the
overall appearance.&nbsp; A female minifig
with the grey suit-jacket torso and dark tan legs creates a fitting “working
woman” driver, complete with briefcase.&nbsp;
The car handily includes a place behind the seat to stow the
briefcase.&nbsp; The result of the build is a
very attractive and sturdy convertible.&nbsp;
A small traffic light is included that I suppose increases playability,
but for me goes straight in the parts bin.</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">If the car was an appetizer, the breakdown truck is the main
course.&nbsp; The license plate indicates this
is another fine design from Pierre Normandin; the AFOL turned Lego Designer
responsible for some of the best small vehicle designs in recent years.&nbsp; The chassis is built on 2 x 16 plates, with
an assortment of brown and white tiles sandwiched in between.&nbsp; I don’t know if these parts are included as a
gift to AFOL part monkeys or simply due to production limitations, but the
color and part choices are unusual, and continue a trend seen in earlier sets
by Mr. Normandin.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The cab construction includes many of the techniques found
in previous City trucks, including the use of the full and half mudguards, the
SNOT front bumper, and the use of the hinge plates and 2-wide cheese slopes as
side mirrors.&nbsp; Inside the cab is a
steering wheel and the ubiquitous coffee cup.&nbsp;
I wondered why the license plate sticker was not centered until I saw
that this would span the two curved slopes that make up the front bumper.&nbsp; The front of the truck does depart from
previous cab-over designs and makes an innovative use of the Vehicle, Mudguard
3 x 4 x 1 2/3 Curved Front from the Cars sets to create a more conventional
sloping hood.&nbsp; Interestingly, the hood is
attached with a Plate, Modified 2 x 2 x 2/3 with 2 Studs on Side, even though
the forward facing studs aren’t used for attachment.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">The truck is completed with creation of the flatbed, which
is a 6 x 14 plate bordered with tiles attached with SNOT plates.&nbsp; The bed is attached to the chassis with 2 x 4
hinge plates introduced in last year’s sets.&nbsp;
The bed is completed with a working winch and a trans-blue “light bar”
across the top.&nbsp; A fairly generic
mechanic minifig is included and a wrench that attached to the side of the
truck completes the set.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">So how does the car loading work?&nbsp; Surprisingly well considering there are no
ramps at the end of the bed and the truck doesn’t “kneel” like the Technic
version.&nbsp; The picture on the box shows
the car attached with the curved hook on the bumper, but the instructions show
a sturdier attachment using the stud on the side of the hook.&nbsp; The front of the car does drag a bit until
the front wheels hit the truck bed, but the winch pulls the car smoothly up the
tilted truck bed.&nbsp; A nice touch is the
included 2-wide yellow cheese slopes that act as wheel chocks behind the front
wheels.&nbsp; As mentioned previously, the
wide car wheels barely fit the 6-wide truck bed, but the winch holds the
vehicle securely when driven around.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><br></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In summary, this set is another excellent City vehicle, sure
to delight both children and AFOLs alike.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5

"sf1378","2013-03-08T20:08:13.607Z","NICE TRUCK.","I realised yesterday that the driver of the recovery truck is a clone of one of the figures from 4434 Dump Truck from 2012.

"city_transport_rox","2013-01-19T02:16:20.803Z","The LEGO City Truck Collection Continues.....","<p>In my opinion, 2012 was a rather disappointing year for LEGO city, with the forest fire being the lowest. However, 2013 has shown itself to be pretty good so far, with many great trucks already been released, and among them, this great tow truck caught my eye.</p><p>When i first saw this set i knew it was going to be a must-buy. So i went out and bought it and i was not disappointed. It comes with a great looking truck and a car. It also has a&nbsp;woman minifig with rare red hair. The set is also great because it feels like you are getting two sets: The car and the truck.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great town addition</li><li>Nice car with space for suitcase</li><li>Truck hook works well</li><li>Heaps of accessories e.g cup. suitcase</li><li>2 great minifigs</li><li>Traffic light</li><li>Attractive box design</li><li>Great value for money (Even in Australia!!)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>String is difficult to attach </li><li>Some stickers are annoying</li></ul>

"Harmonious_Building","2014-02-24T20:12:38.663Z","Flat-out good. ","<p>The last few years have been bumper ones for awesome City vehicles, and Flatbed Truck is yet another great installment in a line that seems to get better and better with each iteration. It doesn&#39;t matter, really, that City vehicles innovate little as time progresses - it&#39;s a gradual evolution upwards that hits the spot just well enough, and leaves enough room for improvement for what is sure to come the following year for as long as LEGO exists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At US$20, this set is much beefier than the usual impulse buy, yet is still not absurdly expensive to the point where one will feel the pinch for getting it. It&#39;s populated by two Minifigs who are not particularly special, but they do the job in terms of helping to keep one&#39;s city populated. The working woman in particular ought to appeal to angry Internet feminists in search of righteous equality everywhere, even in a miniature world made out of ABS plastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The titular flatbed truck is, of course, the primary build here, and the bright orange stands out nicely and is appropriate for a service vehicle like this one. There&#39;s not much to complain about the front cab except for the bumper - an off-centre sticker? On a curved surface? TLG pls. It doesn&#39;t work. I didn&#39;t apply it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back of the truck tips, of course, and there&#39;s a little hook on a string that works reasonably well, and the car was definitely designed to have synergy with it (it doesn&#39;t work so well with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8402-1/Sports-Car"">8402</a>, for example). There&#39;s also a couple of 2-wide wedges that keep the car surprisingly stable on the back of the truck while it&#39;s zipping along.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And speaking of the car, this dark red beauty is perhaps reason enough to pick this set up. In spite of the fact that we&#39;re spoilt for choice when it comes to trucks every year, the reality is that there remains a constant paucity of plain ol&#39; cars when it comes to new releases. The car here is less flashy than the one in the aforementioned 8402 or <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/3648-1/Police-Chase"">3648</a>, for example, but it&#39;s still made out of attractive curves and comes in a great colour - in a way, this makes it much more realistic and therefore much cooler. But again, one dark spot mires the experience: a license plate sticker on a curved piece. Why.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, this is a great set that looks good and has wide appeal. The truck is above average, with the real selling point here being the car (the traffic light is sort of pointless until we actually get AFFORDABLE ROAD PLATES), which is absolutely fantastic. An evergreen set for acolytes and veterans alike - you can&#39;t go wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Two manuals and two sets of bags, one for the car and traffic light, and the other for the truck.</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The truck driver: Pretty much the same as all City service minifigs. Nothing new and worth mentioning here.</p><p>The lady: This is my fifth character with this outfit, but why count when this one's hair and face are unique?</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>5-10 minutes on the car only, and another 15 or so on the truck. People know me for being a speedy Lego builder, so building is not usually the most fun part of a new Lego set compared to pieces...</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The car is 4-wide like most City cars and 4x4s. Only one figure can fit in and there is a little holder for her suitcase.</p><p>The truck is 6-wide which makes room for two figures (if you manipulate them) and the 6x14 plate goes up and down by turning the black gear. Also note the emergency lights on the ""roof"" of the truck.</p><p>The traffic light is, well, you can never have enough traffic lights in&nbsp;a city...</p>
