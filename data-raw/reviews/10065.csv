I am glad that I am the first to type a review for set #60018. I like to
start out by saying two things, I also own set #7990 Cement Mixer from 2007,
and that my job is testing material for construction, like concrete, so I be around
a number of mixers over the years. When I saw the new mixer listed, I was happy
that it had a chute instead a hose like 2007 mixer has. The chute makes the set
look more like true mixer. Also the yellow part on the back that help with
""concrete"" from bounce off the chute, it looks like the chute for
dumping in the mix at the batch plant, but itâ€™s a little low on the drum (some modifying
can change that). That why I gave it a 5 on overall, playability, and value. </p><p>Like I said above I own set #7990, as I have the two sitting side by side
with the plans out. At first look the truck look similar expect for the chute
and hose and color, but there are difference between the two in build. First,
the wheel base is the same for both truck but the chassis builds are different.
Next, bumper to bumper, the older truck is longer. With the chute straight
back, the new truck overall length is longer. The cab of the new truck is shorter,
the roof sits higher than the older, and it is hinged at the front to lift up
to show an engine. Also it a small build in the plans before adding it on. The drums
are mostly the same, drum, gears, and gearbox, but hinged differently. There is
other little difference like minifigures, but I've typed too much. </p><p>

I like to finish by saying, if you planning on making a city; this set is a
need for that. I plan to get a second truck later to have a small fleet of
truck to go with construction sets.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<p>
 <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=60018-1"" title=""View set details"">60018</a> Cement Mixer is one of three new 6-wide trucks that&nbsp;LEGO&nbsp;now refers to as&nbsp;&#39;Great Vehicles&#39;.</p>
<p>
 The&nbsp;&#39;Great Vehicles&#39; range was introduced in 2007, with a recycling truck (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7991-1"" title=""View set details"">7991</a>) and a cement mixer (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7990-1"" title=""View set details"">7990</a>). Before them, Town and City vehicles were largely 4 wide and/or juniorised. We can consider 2007, then, as the year that LEGO started making decent City sets, after more than 10 years of mediocre offerings.</p>
<p>
 Since then,&nbsp;LEGO has <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=City&amp;subtheme=Traffic"">made some excellent vehicles</a>, and it looks as if the three 2013 sets will&nbsp;continue to live up to the high standard we&#39;ve come to enjoy.</p>

<h2>
 Box and contents</h2>
<p>
 The front of the box looks excellent and I think will significantly contribute to the set flying off the shelf. The yellow of the cab contrasts superbly with the blue of the box and the picture shows a hive of activity and play possibilities.</p>

 The back amplifies the play possibilities and shows what moves and how.</p>

 Inside, the parts are in two numbered bags. The two halves of the mixer are loose in the box, along with a sticker sheet and one instruction book.</p>

<h2>
 Construction</h2>
<p>
 Bag one contains the minifigs, which I&#39;ll mention later, and the chassis. There are few new parts in the set, in fact the only ones I noticed are two <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=6019987"">&#39;Plade 1X2 M. Van. Hul &Oslash; 4,8&#39; </a>[sic] which you can see above the mudguard at the front.</p>

<p>
 Bag two builds the cab and mixer. The cab attaches via clips at the front...</p>

<p>
 ...which form a hinge and, in a first for a &#39;Great Vehicle&#39;, allow the cab to be tipped forwards to reveal the engine underneath. The back of the cab is a yellow <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=4648114"">&#39;Wall 1X6X3 W. Studs&#39;</a>&nbsp;which was used in last year&#39;s tipper truck, in grey.</p>

<h2>
 The completed model</h2>
<p>
 The mixer mechanism is also attached to the chassis by way of clips. The grey wheel on the side is used to rotate the mixer which has a helical screw in it. Turn it one way and the 1x1 round plates provided remain in the mixer, turn it the other and they are ejected out of the end.</p>
<p>
 I haven&#39;t applied the stickers. I don&#39;t mind doing so when there&#39;s a good chance they can be applied perfectly, but I&#39;d probably have difficulty getting the two large ones&nbsp;round the mixer exactly lined up.&nbsp;You only get one chance with stickers. Mess them up and they are ruined.</p>

<p>
 The main design&nbsp;difference between this version of cement mixer compared to 2007&#39;s <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7990-1"" title=""View set details"">7990</a> is the addition of a chute and guide at the back. The chute can be rotated and angled, and the guide tilted up and down.</p>

<p>
 This means there&#39;s&nbsp;a good&nbsp;chance&nbsp;the &#39;cement&#39; will&nbsp;land in the wheelbarrow.</p>

<h2>
 The minifigs</h2>
<p>
 The minifigs in City sets are rarely reason enough to buy a set, and the pair in this one are no exception. They are perfectly suited to the model, but nothing special.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8394343853/"" title=""60018 Cement Mixer by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""60018 Cement Mixer"" height=""341"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8053/8394343853_e36e7270a0.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<h2>
 Comparing to 2007&#39;s 7990</h2>
<p>
 7990&nbsp;was a superb model, so much so that it&#39;s one of the few that I haven&#39;t broken down and bagged up. However, this new cement mixer is better in many ways. They are very similar in size and design but comparing the two you can see that the mixer on 7990 is mounted at a much greater angle which has resulted in the end of the mixer being much higher than the cab. This design flaw has been addressed in 60018 and the result is much more realistic.</p>
<p>
 <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/8395427656/"" title=""60018 Cement Mixer by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""60018 Cement Mixer"" height=""341"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8185/8395427656_eb03d4df9d.jpg"" width=""500"" /></a></p>
<p>
 The chute at the back&nbsp;provides for much better playability than the pipe on 7990 which of course was not functional.</p>
<p>
 &nbsp;</p>

<h2>
 Conclusion</h2>
<p>
 Looking at 7990 in isolation you could be forgiven for thinking it was pretty much perfect, but with this set LEGO has shown that you can improve on perfection...</p>
<p>
 Of the 2013 sets I&#39;ve built so far, this has been my favourite, and proves that LEGO does not need licenses or fancy IPs to be able to create superb sets.</p>
<p>
 City sets remain some of the best value LEGO sets available and this one is no exception. This is definitely one that every City fan,&nbsp;and&nbsp;those who are looking for an exceptional &#39;old school&#39; LEGO set, should add to their collection.</p>

For any other left-handers simply reverse the positions of the cogs, turning knob and exhaust and there you have it.</div><div><br></div><div>Its a great improvement on the last iteration and the colour choice is lovely - makes a nice contrast side-by-side to the tipper truck from 2012.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Harmonious_Building","2013-08-02T10:01:37.613Z","Long, hard, and full of cement.","<div>We who buy LEGO are seriously spoiled for choice, and a large part of that reason, for better or for worse, is due to the buffet of licensed themes and sets that we have to choose from year after year. It's easy to forget, however, that LEGO's bread-and-butter is still the tried-and-true and everlasting City theme, and to carry the food analogy slightly further, I think it always works as a palate cleanser to go back every once in a while and look at a set completely divorced from the trappings of Hollywood glitz and glamour. One of my recent choices in this regard was the Cement Mixer.</div><div><br></div><div>Huw was able to make a comparison with <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7990-1"">7990</a> from 2007, a set that I had wanted to own but was never able to find for cheap since it went off the shelves just prior to me coming out of my ""dark ages"". A new iteration of the classic cement mixer was therefore something that I found myself getting quite excited about, and for US$20 it was too hard to pass up when it was released.</div><div><br></div><div>This set unfortunately suffers from a slightly lower piececount owning to the necessity of including the two halves of the mixing cylinder that serve as the visual and mechanical centrepiece of the model. Two Minifigs is also standard for a vehicle set, and you get a foreman and someone for the foreman to boss around. A wheelbarrow, a shovel, and a plethora of dark grey ""cement"" pieces make this set highly playable for kids and grownups alike, which makes this a really fun little model on its own.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Don't be fooled: this model packs in a lot of intricate detail and some nifty - perhaps even unexpected - features. The primary one is a little rotating mechanism that controls the cement drum, and the highly specialised drum parts are designed such that the ""cement"" pieces are caught in a spiral and pushed out, where they can be guided via a chute into the wheelbarrow waiting below. The front cabin also tilts forward to allow the drum a bit of maneuverability, which is a cool feature but I'm not entirely sure that this is true of actual cement mixer trucks, but perhaps that's beside the point. There's even some little ""<a href=""http://www.brickape.com/2011/07/lets-talk-greebling.html"">greebling</a>"" at the side in the form of a control panel. You'll find, though, that this attention to detail is sprinkled throughout a very interesting construction, so you're guaranteed to love this model from start to finish.</div><div><br></div><div>If I had to dock points for anything at all, it would be the use of stickers on the cement drum. The usual ones that give the license plate and other vehicular details are pretty inoffensive, but there is no way that I would ever attempt to place the large ones and expect to be satisfied with the end result. Frankly, the model looks fantastic without the stickers, and my advice would be to leave them off, or else risk messing up the entire set, which would be a huge bummer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>City vehicles just seem to get better and better each year, and our cement mixer definitely achieves the high bar that LEGO has set for it. It's affordable, looks and works great, and is tons of fun. In fact, if you're a complete neophyte or someone considering coming out of your ""dark ages"", I would probably say that this is the set to go for.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"LCPTF8404","2013-05-27T01:24:37.857Z","Very Good for a new Great Vehicles set.","The Lego City Cement Mixer #60018. I got this set fro my birthday along with the Tanker Truck #60016 and the Loader and Tipper#4201. It's a very playable set and fits every aspect.<br><br>1. Minifigures: The set comes with two mininfigs. First, we have the driver who wears a black cap, the overalls torso, and orange pants. He's very well suited for a driver. And we have the worker who wears a red construction hat, the orange construction torso, and sand yellow pants. I like how they put the miner's head in the minifig. It looks great. Overall, both minifigs are well suited for this set.<br><br>2. Accessories: The accessories in this set are a wheelbarrow, a red mug, a shovel, and I guess you can count the grey studs as accessories too. I love the new wheelbarrow pieces, but they're annoying to build. Almost every vehicle in Lego City comes with cups now. Don't really care, but it's Lego. The studs a good attachment, as long as you don't lose them. Overall, the accessories are alright. It depends how you like them.<br><br>3. The Vehicle: The cement mixer itself is actually a very good looking vehicle. It's yellow, has a grey mixer, four wheels,and a playability feature. I'd actually prefer this over the older cement mixer form 2007. I like the design and that you can move the front and mixer up. But the feature I like most is the fact that you can mix the mixer with a turn-able piece. And the studs can come out of the mixer once you move it. The truck is a very awesome itself all the way.<br><br>4. Final Thoughts: I would obviously recommend you buy this set Great minifigs, accessories, and a very awesome truck. The price ($20 for a 221 piece set) is well suited. Unlike $20 for the 4x4 &amp; Diving Boat or $7 for the little sets like the Fire Motorcycle, Police ATV, and/or Surfer Rescue. But anyway this set is great, not my favorite Great Vehicle set, but worth buying.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"martiniman","2014-08-10T00:06:21.907Z","Blunder concrete","<p>No matter how awesome this cement truck looks, especially from the front, this set makes &quot;The Man Upstairs&quot; fromt the Lego movie totally right. You need one second glue for LEGO like this.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty heavy and offers a decent value for the money. Instructions are straightforward in a single book.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This truck shows clearly that LEGO has too many different parts nowadays. Essential things are dreadfully connected with very classic parts (mixer itself on the truck) where you would expect the part catalog to have better options. In other areas many one-trick bricks are used where a more generic solution would have faired equally.</p>

<p>Take for example the rear of the cabin. Why LEGO needs to come with come one-piece wall element is a complete riddle. They should have used 4 stacked 1x6 regular bricks. Now the roof is very loose and falls off all the time.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Nothing special. I dislike the new detailed face minifigs. Please drop the beard and mouth expressions again.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty straightforward. I&#39;m always puzzled why there is such a big palette of colours used for the frame. You don&#39;t see it, yet it consists of red, yellow, white, grey and dark grey items.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The front looks perfect. It is an awesome looking (cement) truck from the front. The water tank looks a bit weird though. The one on the old 7990 looks better. The rear is a complete miss. The yellow funnel looks very weird, even worse, it has a horrible and flimsy construction. The mech to rotate the bucket is hard to operate as it is a little recessed. There is as usual nowadays an overdose of low quality stickers, none of them adding anything relevant for the looks.</p>

<p>But then the most important thing: my little boy loves any construction vehicle and when he sees one, it will be played with. This cement mixer falls apart in 5 or more pieces in under 1 minute. It&#39;s construction is the worst aspect. The cabin falls of, the roof of the cabin falls of, the bucket falls of, the funel falls of, the water tank falls of, and the plate sandwich that holds the wheels together breaks in half very fast. The truck has a playability of 0 (no option here). The only solution is one-second glue. Like in the LEGO movie. Glue it together, and you have a pretty cool looking Cement Mixer Truck. For kids play it does not qualify though. A big miss!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Skip it. If you have the LEGO equivalent of your dad&#39;s attic railway, go ahead, built it and never touch it again. If you want to play construction stories with it, forget this truck. It is a frustrating car. You better built a truck repair shop around it instead of using it on a building construction site.</p>

<p>This is an awesome set. I could see a smaller kid getting hours of play with it. The cement barrel is slightly unstable, however this doesn&#39;t hinder the great playability. The barrel turns, the cement gate lifts, the cab lifts, and the chute can rotate! Overall great set and I would definitely recommend it.</p>
