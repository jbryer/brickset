The turtles are cool, if you don't like the shell piece they are wearing you can take it off and there is a shell printed underneath that piece.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Play ability: The play ability is great as a kid you can shoot the bad guys with the gun or if you have a Lego train set pull the wheels up and drive on the tracks.

"Odeinoichus","2014-04-01T01:35:46.35Z","Massive Vehicle","<p><strong>Set # 79104 The Shellraiser Street Chase:</strong> This is the largest and most expensive TMNT set from the first year of the Theme. Like most sets we have a lot to thank Nikelodeon and their new cartoon for, this could almost be a combination of the old Party Wagon and the 2009 series&#39; primary vehicle. The price is slightly high for my tastes, however I feel this is a really impressive set. We&#39;re going to go over all the highpoints in this review, so let&#39;s get started.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box for the set is huge, it shows off the set with some dynamic looking action on the front and the features of the set in the back. Something I haven&#39;t mentioned before is the inclusion of a short comic strip on the back of the boxes. They look fun and are similar to the Super Heroes comics. All around this is a great design.</p>

<p>The instructons included are fairly thick and pretty impressive, showing off all of the steps for the build nicely. The comic is also found in the back of the manual along with a mini-figure checklist and a nice checklist of the sets, along with a great looking poster using the LEGO Mini-Figures in the back. Overall a great looking manual.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a lot of great colours for the parts, there&#39;s mostly a lot of yellow and grey. But there are also some impressive looking dull green pieces that look great. The most useful pieces in my mind are the train wheels for the turtle&#39;s vehicle, which is made out of a subway car. There are very few printed elements in this set because most of the details are stickers unfortunately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes five Mini-Figures, two Turtles and three of their enemies. All five are some great additions to the Turtle Mini-Figure collection and feature some interesting prints.</p>

<p>The Kraang has the same print as the polybag from last year, so there isn&#39;t much more I can add to how impressed I was by the detail of the print. The big draw for this one is the fact that it has a weapon for firing on the Turtles and a back bracket with simple jetpack design (using a pair of LEGO Binoculars) so it can fly after the Turtles. (Or other enemies.)</p>

<p>The Foot Soldier in this set is unique to this set, the print detail on it is different from the other Foot. He has a dark maroon coloured pair of pants with kneepads printed on and is wearing a typical Foot Clan Gi, open to reveal an undershirt of a light grey colour matching his hand colour. He&#39;s carrying a gold katana and looks like a great leader for a squadron of normal Foot. A great looking Mini-Fig.</p>

<p>Mikey is the same Turtle found in Kraang Lab Escape, except for the facial print which has him sticking his tongue out as if he&#39;s licking his lips while chasing the pizza truck. The turtles are great looking mini-figs. This version of Mike has a different weapon, I have no idea what it&#39;s official name is, but it&#39;s this chain based weapon with a spike on one end.</p>

<p>Leo looks great, this version has a great expression with a gritted teeth expression determined for battle. His torso print is awesome looking too, he&#39;s lighter than Raph, but darker than Donny and Mike. The fact that all four turtles are different shades of green is awesome, I love that LEGO chose to really emulate the cartoon here because they could have gone the cheaper route and just used all the same colour of green. He has four katana, two of them were included with the weapon rack which is a bit odd, but I suppose even the turtles need spares in case they loose their weapons while fighting the Kraang and the Foot.</p>

<p>Dogpound is a pair of standard Mini-Figure legs with leg printing and an upper torso with arms that&#39;s a brand new sculpted single piece. It&#39;s a great way to capture the look of this new mutant enemy of the Turtles. He just looks awesome, the sculpt, the level of printed detail makes him a must own character. He has no accessories however, which is a shame.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a great set of Mini-Figures in this set, the same could be said of all the TMNT sets honestly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are five numbered bags in this set, each one builds a section of the Shellraiser (except for bag #1, which is the Foot&#39;s escaping pizza delivery truck.)</p>

<p>The smaller model is a fun, fast build with several stickers unfortunately. The real fun in thebuild of this set is the satisfying step-by-step, bag-by-bag build of the Shellraiser. Some of the steps can be a bit weak until you get it altogether, there are a few parts that love to fall apart easily while you&#39;re building, but once&nbsp;the finished model is complete you get a really solidly built subway car with some really odd looking extra wheels and a few fun play features.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The pizza truck looks a little small, perhaps slightly too out of scale for the vehicle type it&#39;s meant to be, however the fact that the Turtle&#39;s vehicle dwarfs it so completely makes it work great. It holds two ooze/mutagen canisters and has a TCRI license plate, which is really a fun nod to the series and the origins of the Turtles. The menues are stickers and look pretty fun too, with a LEGO Mini-Fig chef for the logo.</p>

<p>The Shellraiser itself is a massive vehicle, this thing is big enough to dwarf the Batmobile. If I had one to compare it to I could state that with certaintity. This really looks like a converted subway car, it uses massive wheels and features side doors that open to reveal the interior for playing, a lot of stickers capture the design aesthetics from the cartoon. It looks serviceable, I think it would have been better to use printing though. Mostly because some of the stickers used for detail are meant to be across two panels, which can be finnicky to line up right when applying them.</p>

<p>The rear wheels are massive, the front wheels are smaller and look like they would never hold up this subway car. Still that just adds to the fun of it, the large missile launching weapon on the top is a great play feature and I really love the look of the cannon built out of red bricks and a red garbage can. It looks like something the Turtles would build.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a weapon rack that can be detached on one inside door panel and another holds a computer station for Donny and a skateboard rack for Mikey&#39;s skateboard. (Which is included in this set.)</p>

<p>The best feature of the set by far is the method of raising the &#39;street&#39; wheels and incorporating the subway car&#39;s &#39;track&#39; wheels so it can ride on LEGO train tracks. I really love the bulk and design of this vehicle, it may not be to everyone&#39;s tastes, but in the end it has a lot of personality and looks like a great &#39;super hero&#39; signature vehicle. (With enough space to hold all four Turtles and their allies.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I think this is a must own set, it&#39;s really the big name draw for the first batch of TMNT sets and I really dig the vehicles in this set more compared to Shredder&#39;s Dragon Bike. The Mini-Figures in the set are all great too with some unique prints and definitely make this a must own set. Recommended.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Fun set, fun figures</li><li>Lots of accessories</li><li>Still playing with it daily a month later…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Shellraiser stability. &nbsp;Model wants to break. &nbsp;A lot.</li><li>The wheels going up and down seem cool, but the fact that they don't stay that way make it difficult to play with. &nbsp;Especially in light of the above.</li><li>Little bummed there isn't a sled that shoots out of the shell raise, like in the show...</li></ul>
<p>I think this a great set for big fans of the show. &nbsp;I think the Chima models, which are constructed not to match an image in a show but the other way around, have better stability and playability.</p>",TRUE,3,5,4,2,4
