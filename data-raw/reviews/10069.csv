"legolover9","2013-03-27T15:22:23.973Z","One of my best sets...fun to play with!","There's the 2 best turtles in all of TMNT, Raf and Leo. The pizza oven is a really cool feature. There are so many new pieces for my collection! Although there are a lot of stickers, it makes it look very lively. I can use the stairs to move all the characters to the little ladder. The skateboards are very fun. There are many different traps to trap the bad guys and there's a little desk but I don't know what it's for. There's one purple piece and this piece, barely anybody has because so many people don't think this set would be good. Lastly, the tree adds a little nature to a city set.&nbsp;",FALSE,5,5,3,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2014-04-26T17:02:48.513Z","More play features than Mini-Figure accomodation space","<p><strong>Set #79103 Turtle Lair Attack: </strong>This set from LEGO&#39;s TMNT theme has a lot of impressive design work and a lot of fun play features. Unfortunately in my eyes the space is a bit cluttered and not wide enough to put Mini-Figures inside the actual lair portion of this set. Still, it&#39;s a fun looking set and a must own one for certain characters only being made available in it so far.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set has a great looking box, it shows off the features and the set quite effectively. I love the look of it, the action scene on the front is really appealing. There is one minor problem with this box though, the manuals are not cardboard protected. With a set this size, in this type of box it isn&#39;t a common thing to happen, unfortunately because there is no protection you run the risk of&nbsp;a damaged sticker sheet. (And there are a lot of stickers for detail in this set.) This is a really dissapointing thing, mine came with a sheet that had been bent clean in half, and now three stickers are creased and constantly curl up after being placed on their respective areas of the build.</p>

<p>LEGO, if you&#39;re going to rely on stickers for detail work at least have the decency to protect the sheets, or use a material that even if creased will still remain stuck flush to the bricks once applied. It must be cheaper to make small sticker sized cardboard protectors than the huge ones the instruction sheets rely on.</p>

<p>Speaking of the instructions this set features two booklets, one medium sized one found in your typical 25$ and up price point sets and one larger manual found in more 50$ and up sets. The first manual is for bag #1 while the larger bag is for the main model build using bags 2-4 included in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set doesn&#39;t feature many stand out parts, it does come with some of the nice pillar pieces in gray and an off orange tone. Plus there are three large backward sloped pieces used in the skateboard ramp build. And maybe a few other bits I&#39;m not familiar enough to name properly, they could be useful for MOCs. This set also includes another of the staircases that spiral out, unfortunately you only get three stairs which don&#39;t work as well when you have a full set of the things.</p>

<p>By now I have at least ten Orange Brick Seperators, a very useful piece, which I kind of wish would come in different colours for different themes because it would make for a nice colour coded bit of fun on LEGO&#39;s part. Still though, they are quite useful for building and disassembling LEGO bricks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get five Mini-Figures in this set, another Foot Soldier which has no difference in print from the other sets, two turtles, Master Splinter and the Dark Ninja. A nice selection of figures, let&#39;s go into their details.</p>

<p>Foot Soldier as I mentioned above has the exact same print as found on most of the others. His weapon is built out of three pieces and looks impressive, I think it&#39;s some kind of small bladed scythe or something. All I know is it&#39;s cool looking, he also has a gold shuriken.</p>

<p>Dark Ninja, is meant to be Dogpound&#39;s human form before he was mutated I think. He has bare arms and a nice dark maroon double-sided torso print, with matching legs. (No printing on the legs though) and he has a menacing looking facial print with beard and mustache. His eyes are really wide and white, not the same as Vitruvius from the Movie Theme, but different from most Mini-Figure eyes making me wonder if he&#39;s supposed to be blind too or something. Then again Dogpound isn&#39;t supposed to be blind.</p>

<p>His weapon of choice is twin black katana, overall he&#39;s a nice looking leader for your Foot soldiers to lead them in battle while Shredder is busy.</p>

<p>Leonardo has the same body print found in Shellraiser Street Chase, but he has a different facial print with a closed scowling mouth. He also has his blue skateboard in this set. Not much else to say though, the turtles constantly impress with their designs and print detailing, which is mostly the same from set to set.</p>

<p>Raphael much like Leo doesn&#39;t bring anything different to the party print wise, the new 2014 sets offer a nice new change in printing, but for the most part the turtles of 2013 share the same prints and detailing from set to set, except for the head. Raph has a toothy looking grimace in this set. He has a red skateboard and his traditional sai weapons.</p>

<p>Splinter is a sloped brick Mini-Figure, instead of traditional legs he&#39;s using the sloped brick with printing for his kimono/robe. The torso is double-sided and looks great and his rat head piece is a neat looking brand new piece. With some excellent detail work matching the show, it is made out of a softer rubbery feeling plastic though making me wonder if I should worry about eventual degrading. He has a katana for a weapon. Honestly I think he&#39;s the biggest draw for this set as far as Mini-Figures go.</p>

<p>For some strange reason the Practice Dummy with Shredder&#39;s helmet and a battle staff isn&#39;t considered a Mini-Figure by LEGO, it doesn&#39;t even seem to have a number to be included as a Mini-Figure on Brickset. It is built using all Mini-Figure parts though, and if the Queen from LEGO Harry Potter&#39;s Room with the Winged Keys set can be considered a Mini-Figure than I think he should as well. Shredder&#39;s helmet is brown in this set, meaning it&#39;s been carved out of wood for the practice dummy.</p>

<p>All in all this set has a great selection of Mini-Figures with some good detail work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The first bag in this set doesn&#39;t build a lot, and it is a numbered bag set with 4 numbered bags. Bags 2-4 are used to build the primary model in modular steps and I did enjoy building the set as I worked on it. It does have a lot of nice detail work during the build, and it also&nbsp;features a uniform design. Unfortunately I think it could use a bit of work, but I&#39;ll go into that in the next section. The build works out great though with simple and easy to follow steps and nothing too difficult to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model has a lot of nice looking design elements, using the transparent green pieces to simulate raw sewage leaking from the cieling (or mutagen/ooze if you prefer) is a really nice touch.</p>

<p>I like the look of the shorter section of the lair more than the taller one. It feautres the practice dummy in the center for the turtles to fight and a nice looking tree growing under the sewers... That&#39;s a neat trick actually. And there&#39;s a lot more space to fit some characters while they practice fighting, it&#39;s pretty impressive. The taller section just has too many play features for my liking and not enough space for all the included micro-builds.</p>

<p>The first story has a work station for Donatello with a micro-build shelf and computer station, it&#39;s pretty cramped. The back wall has a huge sticker on the central wall section with blueprints for Turtle vehicles and weapons, on either side there are stickers for sewer wall detailing. You can fit Donny in here no problem, but with the two microbuilds inside you don&#39;t have much room to actually play. Also the rear wall is a blow-apart wall, push on the back of it and boom the dynamite explodes the wall sending it crashing down. It&#39;s really frustrating because the wall falls down pretty easily whenever you&#39;re not careful in picking up the set to move it.</p>

<p>The staircase leading up to the second floor doesn&#39;t have enough stairs, they tend to move around a lot because of this meaning that Mini-Figures using them to actually climb up would have a hard time, especially since each stair is placed just a little bit too far away from the next. Sure the turtles can just ninja hop up the stairs, but April doesn&#39;t strike me as someone who&#39;d want to do that and Splinter is wearing a long kimono/robe.</p>

<p>Speaking of the second floor it looks interesting, but it&#39;s wierd. You&#39;ve got a pizza cooking stove that can launch cooked pizzas at enemies when you push on the pin behind the stove, but then you&#39;ve got the skateboard holding stand microbuild on one side and a strange minature crane/hook lifting thing for... What does this even do for the turtles? Really the use of space on this floor is terrible and if you want to put your turtles here they&#39;ll be really cramped and boxed in.</p>

<p>The third &#39;floor&#39; is street level, meaning outside the sewer. And like with much of the build it&#39;s way too short, you have a really small stretch of sidewalk that includes a manhole cover, a small wall with mutants rule graffti sticker applied and a fire hydrant and street lamp microbuild. The play feature here is that you can spin a rod behind the wall and flip the manhole cover up to launch any enemies standing on it flying, a neat feature, unfortunately it means you can&#39;t use the manhole as an entrance to the lair because the technic pin assemply to send it flipping up is in the way.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also no real place or space for the turtle&#39;s t-v set with seating space or the skateboard ramp, a pretty oddly designed set with a few too many play features and not enough interior space to accomodate the Mini-Figures nicely. I do like the little ninja flipping figure launcher though, that&#39;s a great play feature for this theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I still think this is a worthwhile set to pick up, I mean with a bit of MOCing you could probably make something ten times better. However kids will have fun playing with it and it does match the show. Plus you get some great looking figures in the set and it&#39;s the only way to own Master Splinter. I do wish LEGO had made the lair itself a bit larger and why couldn&#39;t both sides have a street level? Midly reccommended.</p>
