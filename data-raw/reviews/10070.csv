"SKip_E_Productions2","2013-01-12T01:56:18.81Z","Off the Brick: Kraang Lab Escape","<p>Welcome to 2013, LEGO fans! 2013 has brought us great new themes and great new sets, and for my first review, I'll be doing a TMNT one. My first choice for a set (preceding the Shredder's Dragon Bike and Stealth Shell in Pursuit), this set is very much worth the value although at some points hits a ginormous snag. So without further ado, BOOYAKASHA!! </p><p><strong>Pros: </strong></p><ul><li>The minifigures are well done. I like how rather than using another bald head, the LEGO Group decided to use a custom minifigure head mold on Michaelangelo instead. As for the Foot Clan Ninja, seriously LEGO. Do you really want us to put hair on a minifigure not meant to be bald? Also, the Kraang is really cute rather than sinister. The printing on the minfigures is superb as well!</li><li>There are a lot of fun play features in this set, such as the ""exploding"" holding cell, the flick missiles, and the whole ""chicken walker-turned-escape pod"" gimmick. I think LEGO is starting to bank on this play feature. (See my Galaxy Squad Swarm Interceptor review for details.) </li><li>Very fun and simple build. </li><li>The pizza is a nice touch. :) </li></ul><p><strong>Cons: </strong></p><ul><li>The lasers on the cage don't reach all the way to the top. No wonder Mikey was able to slip the pizza out. :P </li><li>The ninja must've been really klutzy to not notice a WARM UNEATEN FULL PIZZA lying on the ground! </li><li>The escape pod. If there are no wings on it, how is the Kraang able to fly away? Huh? </li><li>The Kraang minifigure is WAAAAAAAAYY out of scale. In the show, the turtles are able to hold it with both hands. Here, it can be held with one hand. </li><li>THE SET FEELS MEGA BLOK-ISH. I don't know why, but I'm really starting to not like LEGO's whole ""new piece for a new year"" deal. Seriously. STOP MAKING NEW PIECES! GET US AS BUILDERS TO IMPROVISE! </li><li>The bald ninja. And basically any other ""bald"" minifig out there (Spider-Man, Captain America, Venom, Iron Fist, Deadpool, etc.) </li></ul><p>Overall, this set is an amazing start to the TMNT line. It's simple and fun. I hope this theme doesn't run into the ground like Ben 10 (which made a few sets) and SpongeBob (which makes like 2 sets every 5 years or something). I highly recommend this set to TMNT fans and collectors and it also makes a great gift!</p><p>SKip-E-Productions2, getting Off the Brick! (See, I'm trying new slogans. What do you think?) </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-11-09T11:23:56.693Z","Heroes in a Half-Shell, well Hero at any rate.","<p><strong>Set #79100 Kraang Lab Escape: </strong>Aside from Polybags this is the smallest set from the new TMNT Theme and it is fairly ok, it could use a better price point. That being said let's get on with the review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Conservation of space, that's the new rule LEGO is following and this set is no exception. Not only is it in a smaller box for a set of this size (square instead of rectangular), but it also takes up less space on the shelves and in the cases meaning that more of them will be available for sale at any retailer. Provided they can keep it in stock.</p>
<p>The instructions are typical from LEGO, brilliantly simple and easy to follow with, as usual, no protection. Meaning they often come curled or folded over in the box. Sometimes even mangled depending on how it was stuffed into the box with the bags for the set. Still, both box and instruction manual serve their intended purposes adequately. The way LEGO makes their instructions hasn't changed too much over the past three decades and I doubt they'll be modifying them too extremely in the next three.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts in the set aren't too terrible rare, for the most part. The large upper bubble/dome of the Kraang vehicle seems to be unique and this set introduces two new style of bar for the nunchucks Mikey carries.</p>
<p>There are also some nice transparent green bits and a printed sloped brick which MOCers may find useful.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Two Mini-Figures are included in this set and one Character as LEGO dubs them.</p>
<p>The first is the Foot Soldier, nothing much else to add on to what I said of this Mini-Figure from Stealth Shell in Pursuit, it's a typical army builder figure, sharing the same body, same print and pretty much everything else. This time around they've given him a mace, I understand LEGO's need to have some variety, but I would have much preferred it if they just stick with giving Foot Soldiers proper weapons as seen on the show, I have never seen a Foot Soldier using a mace and to be honest I'm not as impressed with the piece as others have been in the past. The proportions just look slightly off to me as far as this accessory is concerned, there may be a reason for it, but I feel that a mace should have a proper length of chain between the ball and the handle.</p>
<p>Michealangelo however is a excellent Mini-Figure, similar to Raphael he shares all the same prints on the torso and leg designs, there are a few key differences. The print is modified to show off the unique designs of each turtle from the Nikelodeon show, and Mikey is in a much lighter shade of green. This version has an open toothy smile and really what more can you say about the figure? The Turtles as a whole are some of the best new Mini-Figs introduced this year, the new shell back piece and the unique head designs just stand out as some excellent fun sculpt work. Capturing the very essence of the characters.</p>
<p>His weapon is much better than the Foot Soldier's, unfortunately he only has one half of his more commonly seen twin nunchucks, the way they are designed as far as accessories go is fairly simple in the LEGO world, a shorter length of chain using a newer style piece that attaches to two wooden rods. The difference between these rods and lightsaber blades are fairly obvious, for one they are slightly shorter, and for another they have two holes on either end meaning they are hollow making them lighter in weight. He also comes with the traditional food of the Turtles, a pizza. All around great design choices.</p>
<p>The final character from the show you recieve is a nicely detailed, if slightly larger than is practical, Kraang alien brain. A new head piece which sits on a standard pink Mini-Figure head, all of the sculpt work from the tentacles down to the fleshy brain matter on top look great. He can't hold standard LEGO accessories however I don't feel he needs to.</p>
<p>Just a great batch of Mini-figures all around, you can never have too many Foot Soldiers after all, even if the weapon is a bit of an odd choice.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The overall build involves two models, for a set of this size I doubt very much that it featured numbered bags, I could be mistaken on that end it's been a while since I picked it up during Bricktober and built the thing, though I don't recall there being numbered bags.</p>
<p>Each model is quick and easy to build for builders of all ages, it took me less than twenty minutes to finish it all after all is said and done, and I had two elements of a Kraang lab ready to go for play time. (Or in this AFOL's case, display time.)</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The primary model is a Kraang mobile craft of some sort which is built in two stages, stage one the upper control section where the Kraang sits, stage two the lower leg section... Actually strike that, I think it's the other way round. Either way it's a large alien life support craft thing with twin flick-fire missles that towers over the turtles.</p>
<p>Great for battles and having loads of fun.</p>
<p>The secondary model is a small jail cell for a turtle, with control panel printed on the sloped brick and a storage place for the weapons. There's a play feature here as well, with a flick of your finger you can press down and send the back of the cell popping off, allowing for quick and easy escapes when it's time to save the day.</p>
<p>Overall I feel that both models are adequate for what this set is trying to do, offer up some fun for the younger crowd to play with and enjoy. That being said not everyone is going to enjoy them, and most AFOLS may be more interested in this set for parts and the Mini-Figs, still a pretty decent pair of models and quite sturdy.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>At the end of the day this set isn't too bad for what you get. That being said the asking price in Canada for this is a bit higher compared to the Star Wars Battle Packs and features one less Mini-Figure comparatively.</p>
<p>I suspect this may be in part due to the nature of the new Kraang piece and the turtle parts used for Mikey. Still 17.99$ for what you get ultimately may not be up to your standards for price per piece ratio. Fortunately it's the holidays, which means loads of sales and discounts. This set makes for a good present for the young ones and a cheap alternative to the larger sets for getting Michealangelo. And forgive me if that isn't spelled right, I did grow up with the 80s after all and that's how they did spell his name once.</p>
<p>Recommended for fans of Turtles.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
