"Odeinoichus","2014-03-23T01:18:23.02Z","The Shredder Arrives","<p><strong>Set # 79101 Shredder&#39;s Dragon Bike: </strong>The LEGO TMNT sets of last year did a great job of introducing the characters, themes and designs of the new cartoon into the world of LEGO. The company also made it fairly cheap to afford the main villain of the Turtles and a rather interesting vehicle for him to ride into battle on.</p>

<p>I think this is definitely a must own set for fans of the TMNT. And here&#39;s why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box for this set is the same uniform look as all the TMNT boxes, I like the designs alot for this Theme the rich dark purple and the impressive looking images for each set really pop out on the shelves and grab your attention. They are a much more impressive design for a Nickelodeon series compared to the softer plainer colours of the Spongebob sets.</p>

<p>The instructions are good too, they&#39;re missing a mini-fig checklist, still all in all they do the job of being easy to follow and show how to build the model. Which is good because this set doesn&#39;t have numbered bags. There really isn&#39;t much more to say actually.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have many parts that are rare or anything too special, however it includes a massive set of wheels. Wheels you ordinarilly wouldn&#39;t find on a vehicle of this size, there are a few useful black parts for MOCs, really though I don&#39;t think anything too special jumps out at me besides the wheels and the technic bars being used to hold the rear wheel in place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has three Mini-Figures.</p>

<p>A Foot Soldier for your army of Foot Clan warriors, the Foot Soldiers are all pretty fun looking, their print details are pretty impressive and this one includes a Katana for his weapon (with an extra just in case you want to wield two) so he&#39;s tops in my book compared to some of the other Foot Soldiers with questionable&nbsp;accessories. You can&#39;t go wrong with an army of these little dudes.</p>

<p>Donatello has a serious looking facial expression in this set and is a lighter tone of green compared to his brother Raph. I believe he&#39;s also slightly darker than Mike though, as each Turtle has a different shade of green. His quarterstaff/Bo weapon is a buildable accessory using two of the new hollow brown rods and a dark brown telescope piece. It does a good job of looking like his weapon from the show.</p>

<p>Shredder has a great looking front print on his legs and torso, but has no printing on his back. He&#39;s also got some impressive sculpted accessories, unique shoulder armour, an awesome looking helmet and two weapons meant to be his wrist guantlets that we saw originally with the Prince of Persia Theme. He also has a nifty light purple cape and some sinister facial scarring. Shredder is the crowning glory of this set and a must own Mini-Figure, even if he doesn&#39;t have any traditional weapons.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a printed tile accessory with a map leading to the Turtle&#39;s Lair apparently, a fun accessory that Donny is trying to get back from the Foot members.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for this model is kind of simple looking, it really isn&#39;t as involved as it could have been. As I said previously there are no numbered bags so you&#39;ll have to seperate the pieces by colour before building. Since the vehicle is mostly black, red and grey this isn&#39;t too difficult. I will say though considering the size of the wheels really makes up the bulk of the model it could have been a bit better designed.</p>

<p>A smaller build for Donatello is included in this set and I kind of feel that this is a better vehicle compared to the dragon bike.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Donatello is riding on a motorized skateboard vehicle which reminds me of the Cheapskate from the old 80&#39;s toyline. It&#39;s a pretty fun little mini-build and works great.</p>

<p>Shredder&#39;s vehicle is impressive looking, however the design is a bit off. The overgrown wheels really hamper it and it doesn&#39;t really look like a dragon. The rear tail section and the front head section of the bike just don&#39;t look dragon-enough. If the bike had slightly smaller wheels and included a bit more in the build it could have looked even more menacing. As is, I think the recent Super Cycle Chase set has given us a better looking bike model. Shredder doesn&#39;t even have any handlebars to use, so how he steers the thing is a mystery.</p>

<p>It does have flick-fire missiles and a nifty looking Foot Clan flag, which does use stickers instead of printed detailing unfortunately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like the set overall, especially since the Mini-Figures are realy impressive, unfortunately the Dragon Bike is a tad ungainly looking and it doesn&#39;t stand out to me as being the best signature vehicle that Shredder could have used. Still if you&#39;d like a challenging MOC alternate build attempt&nbsp; for the model and want to own a Shredder mini-fig this is a must purchase set. If you use the parts to make something better for Shredder to ride around on you&#39;re going to have loads of fun. Recommended.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-04-14T09:35:18.69Z","Not a bad set for TMNT fans","<p>Now in this period of quarantine, I&#39;ve taken some time dig up some of my older Lego sets that were in storage, mainly the TMNT&nbsp;2013 wave&nbsp;sets. My parents bought a lot of the 2013 TMNT&nbsp;sets for me and my sister when I was 7, because&nbsp;I was getting into the 2012 show.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;of the sets Lego put out here where pretty fun, but&nbsp;this set in particular felt like an afterthought compared to the other sets when I was younger (which it was and still is), but now that I have revisited&nbsp;the set, it was WAY better than I remembered and it definitely exceeded my expectations on how much I would enjoy the set now.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The whole build consists of the Shredder&#39;s&nbsp;dragon bike and Donnie&#39;s little car side build. The bike build was pretty fun putting together and playing around with, it wasn&#39;t a complicated build, but still enjoyable. The front regular-sized wheel and the huge back wheel make&nbsp;the vehicle look pretty wacky and appealing which is a good thing. Other things I like about the bike is how the front of the vehicle was built and how it represents a dragon head using 1 by 1 translucent orange studs for the eyes, using&nbsp;a lot of 1 by 1 cheese slopes in black on the sides and using the fang pieces in black ,which really add to the dragon look. The side attachments of the bike include a flagpole with 3 different Japanese word sticker designs present on both sides of the flag and big&nbsp;dual exhaust pipes with flames coming out of it, which was a fun design that makes the bike look more over-the-top. The seating area of the bike can fit Shredder just fine, and there&#39;s only really 1 play feature here and that&#39;s the flick fire missiles on the side of the vehicle, it is shown as a play feature to also be able to turn around to fire at the back. My only problem with the build is how there are no control panels or any sort of handles to drive the vehicle, but other than that, it was a nice build. Donnie&#39;s side vehicle is just a meh, it&#39;s pretty puny and looks like a poly bag build, it&#39;s very small and I guess it works for what it is.</p>

<h3>Parts&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The parts you get here aren&#39;t bad, the huge tire piece and the shredder pieces next to it could be useful, along with the small rocket&nbsp;pieces on the side of the tires and the engine piece in olive green is also nice.</p>

<h3>The Minifigures&nbsp;</h3>

<p>For one of the cheaper sets of the line, the minifigure selection for the set was pretty good. It&#39;s a cheap way to get the main villain Shredder, his torso and leg printing for the armor was pretty good (he has no back torso printing, but it&#39;s mostly fine since he has a cape to cover it), he has the older style cape in dark blue and a neck attachment for some spikes coming out of it. His face print was also nice with a half of the face being burnt and blinded and the other side looking fine, his helmet was a nice mold that accurately represented the character , the actual shredder pieces was fine, but feels like it could&#39;ve looked more accurate with a new piece perhaps. The foot soldier here is a common design that comes in a lot of the sets, but it was a good army building figure, so I don&#39;t mind getting another of him. I no longer have the Donatello figure as I traded it (boy, was that a mistake), but from what I can remember from it, it was a really good figure, with an impressive head mold that&#39;s the same as his brothers, but with a purple mask and a frown expression that was exclusive to this set, the torso printing was different from the other turtles with the staff holder strap printed on there as well as continued to the back with the molded shell piece, which was some excellent continuity, overall a great figure and I definitely regret trading him.</p>

<h3>Value for Money</h3>

<p>The value in this set was great, the size of the bike and 3 figures you get here feels just about right for the price and the side vehicle&nbsp;still sets the scene for a chase, so its&nbsp;inclusion was kinda welcome...</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Yes, it&#39;s another licensed oversized bike set, but the huge size was accurate to the show and the size also makes it look cartoony in a good way. The bike also feels a bit more unique than&nbsp;&nbsp;what you would see from Lego now, the figures were also a great selection for the set. If you are a fan of random and cartoony Lego licensed sets, I&#39;d recommend this set if you find it&nbsp;for a good price online or BrickLink, it&#39;s a nice introductiory set to the TMNT line.</p>
