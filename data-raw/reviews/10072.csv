It has a nice printing and I noticed all of the ones for sale had not scratches or dings. If you are a perfectionists like me you will try to find the one with the straights hat. Do not waste your time. The hat does move as well as the legs, arms and hands. I would amuse the head is movable but ave never tried. The only thing I don't like is the flat piece that says ""LEGO"" and ""ORLANDO"". It is way to big for they key-chain and takes away from the mini figure.</p><p><b>Building Experiance</b></p><p>I consider moving the hat building so I gave it 1 brick, it's a key-chain.</p><p><b>Parts</b></p><p>Great printing. Colors are bright, but easy on the eyes.</p><p><b>Playabitlity</b></p><p>Well the playability is if you took it of the key-chain. It is a very cool mini fig to have around a city. I did not take it of because I wanted a key-chain more than a mini fig. (Plus a second one would be ANOTHER $5)</p><p><b>Value for Money</b></p><p>I gave it a 5 because it is a very cool key-chain and a great souvenir.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,5,1,2,5
