"tisi","2013-02-27T14:22:59.753Z","...and the fire chief saved the day again!","<p>If you do some research, you can recognise that this is the first realistic fire chief car in Lego City's history (all the other fire chief cars haven't got any roof).&nbsp; But let's see the review now.<br></p><p>
<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is smaller than usually - Lego started to make smaller boxes to protect trees, which is a very good decision. On the back of the box you can follow a little story about saving the poor cat stacked on the tree. The instruction booklet is very big I think. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Nice assortment of different parts - you can find accessories (walkie-talkie, fire exhauster) and rare animals (cat, fish) as well. I'm very happy about the small animals, now you can get them without buying a huge set. There is a new part at the front of the car (No. <a href=""http://http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=11291"">11291</a>) - a little bit strange.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Two minifigs is a very good amount, especially because one of them is a WOMAN civilian. This woman looks great - the torso is detailed and has a back printing as well, and her hair is uncommon. The fire chief looks OK - the golden helmet is a good point, but his uniform looks like the other firemen's. It would be better if Lego had given him the pretty cool fire chief torso from the fire station set (No.&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=973pb1304c01"">973pb1304c01</a>). But I'm contented with them.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing special there, it takes only some minutes if you follow the instructions.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The tree consists of three pieces - shame! Lego just put a brown column 
under a green leaf part - is that a tree? And in addition, this column 
piece has a square ending. It would be better if Lego put some 1x1x1 
round bricks as a trunk. The car is great: the front and the back look 
amazing, there is some place at the back for the accessories it has 
rear-view mirrors and a dashboard first in Lego's history! But sadly it hasn't got any doors, and the siren takes place too high on the top of the vehicle.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you compare it to older fire-themed sets, you will see that how much 
have the playability grown. Now you have someone to rescue - very good 
point! Well, it's a bit overpriced, but Lego isn't cheap at all, is it? It's an almost must have for your city, so get it!<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,3
"legogal","2013-09-08T10:50:16.52Z","What a neat car for the Fire Chief!","I agree with everything stated above....nice review!<div><br><div>It is great that the chief can rescue a cat from a tree, but I am sure he would call his firemen to do that menial task. But it is a great story line for the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The lady is beautiful and such an addition to a fire set, which normally I do not buy. And so is the cat. The tree could use some help, but it is rare to get a tree in a car set, so thanks anyway.</div><div><br></div><div>The car has some really nice lines, so I bought it to change it to colors I like better....any pastel for starters. My Friends gals always need new wheels, and this is a cool design.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It seems that a price of 10US would have sold a lot more with just 70 parts. I lucked out and found five of them at WalMart for 7. each. Originally thought about giving them as gifts to kids I know, but thought better about that after building one.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is a swell set with some thoughtful touches that broaden the market beyond most fire sets.&nbsp;</div><div>Thanks, LEGO!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"PicnicBasketSam","2015-02-08T20:13:33.1Z","Boredom Rears Its Ugly Head!","<p>I got most of this set from a friend about a year ago in a bucket of mixed parts. No tree, no lady civilian, no animals, and for some reason, no&nbsp;siren. I can review the car just fine, and it is just a mediocre set. It&#39;s not great, but it&#39;s not terrible, so it&#39;s just... boring.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t have them. The car was simple enough to rebuild without.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A gold helmet and some curvy red bits. Everything else is nothing special.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The &quot;Chief&quot; (The guy in white in the Fire Starter Set is a chief, not some random dude in a gold helmet) is, like I said, a random dude with a gold helmet.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really stupendously fast; 60065 went slower. A few stickers. Blah.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a red car with fire decals. Oh, and there&#39;s half of a storage compartment... how cute. How failerrific. It doesn&#39;t have any moving parts at all!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Do not get this set. It&#39;s out of stores and aftermarket prices are too much. The... everything... is boring, unneeded, and overpriced when it&#39;s on sale. If you need red or firefighters, buy the Fire Starter Set; it&#39;s cheaper, has more figs, and has more playability, and the vehicle is slightly less boring.</p>

<p>I only give it 5 for &quot;value for money&quot; because I got it for free.</p>

The car is an good looking estate what holds the fire chief and his equipment inside. The building of it is easy without any major tricks on it.                                   The tree is build onto an 2x2 flat piece by using an brown pole with the green ""leafs"" on it, so the white common cat can sit on top of an stud.                                      The minifigures are a lady with a sporty jacket on him and a fire cheif with a fish to lure the cat down. Its good set for playability and is good for younger kids.      I recommend!",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
