Unless they make a similar, yet different printed version to ensure the value and rarity of this item.</p>
<p>Elrond is a brilliant looking Mini-Figure, so far my only LotR Elf I am quite impressed by the printing detail on this MF. He is sporting a golden torso with armor detail printing on both sides, I want to say armor from the third-age of Middle-Earth, unfortunately I am a bit rusty on the ages of ME. The legs are green, a light pea green color with printing of the leg armor.</p>
<p>The face features a determined looking expression and a open-mouthed yelling expression. He has some lines on his face that might indicate age, I'm not entirely certain of what detail LEGO was aiming at honestly, elves of LotR typically do not age. I think the detail is actually meant to offer up more realisim to the LEGO Mini-Fig design.</p>
<p>His hair piece is brilliant, I've read that it is simply Legolas' hair in Elrond's colors, if that is the case it still works as Elrond's hair. The paint work around the ears could stand a bit of polish, mine has a few minor dabs of pink flesh tone that look fairly sloppy. However as this is a freebie with the game, I can forgive minor imperfections.</p>
<p>Accessory wise he includes a golden bladed weapon, as seen in the game, and possibly in other sets though I don't know. I don't own anything much from the Theme yet, though I hope to change it. I suspect however this is a unique accessory for&nbsp;Elrond and added value.</p>
<p>Finally we come to his other accessory, one which has had some controversy in the LEGO collecting community, the cape. It is a short blue cape, which some criticize for being inacurrate and Hobbit-sized. The image on the bag does show a much longer cape. To be perfectly blunt, this is a free incentive for those who Pre-Order the game, it doesn't cost you one red cent if you were planning on buying the game originally. And even if you didn't plan on buying the game and were going to buy it now only for this MF alone... Why complain about something as trivial as a cape's length? I could understand if the accessory was not included, had been made in a different color, or even suffered from some kind of defect, to complain about the length alone seems to be nitpicking for nitpicking's sake.</p>
<p>However, this is understandably still something that not everyone will agree upon, I do not feel bothered by the length of the cape. Many have said it is Hobbit sized, now that I have it in hand and can actually see the issue they are raising, I have to say it doesn't bother this reviewer in the slightest. It actually looks rather impressive to see a smaller sized cape on a regular scaled Mini-Fig.</p>
<p>Ultimately it is truly up to you. This Mini-Figure has impressive detail-work, great looking accessories and all around looks great. Especially for a chinese made MF, yes it is Made in China, this too is a huge deal breaker for MF collectors. I can't recommend this item as a retail product, however I say if you're lucky enough to score this for free when picking up the game then there's really nothing that wrong with it. If you seriously hate the cape, well you could always give it to a shorter Mini-Fig.</p>",TRUE,5,2,1,4,5

Now why review a single minifigure ? Simply because it's a great one and worth the review and 5 bricks. Just over a month old and already a collectors-item certainly if you keep it bagged which I didn't. Assembled and ready to be admired or used in a MOC it's more valuable to me. This figure is the first in my LOTR quest, many (probably all of them) will follow.</p><p>Building 1 brick : Just like CMF's it is assembling, not building so 1 brick.</p><p>Parts 5 bricks : All great parts starting with the great hairpiece with elf-ears. Elrond's head is double faced with a shout and a grin, he shows some similarity with the movie. The unique torso and legs look great with underneath it I think an <span class=""hps"">anguish. There is some discussion concerning the cape, but I think this small Dark Blue one fits the figure. The Golden sword looks awesome and a fierce weapon. I'm already curious how he will appear in <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=79006-1"">The Council of Elrond</a>.</span></p><p><span class=""hps"">Playability 4 bricks : The single figure has no playability but because it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;so usefull in LOTR setup's and other MOC's I reward it with 4 bricks.</span></p><p><span class=""hps"">Value 5 bricks : Getting it for free is already worth 5 bricks, if you see the value already after some months it will only increase. It is now already (still bagged) worth some € 25,00 so try and buy the game with the free&nbsp;Elrond polybag as long as it is available !!&nbsp;</span></p>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,5

<p>Elrond is a fantastic minifigure!&nbsp; </p>
<p>He comes with great parts in all ways. </p>
<p>First off, he is the first minifig to wield the new elven blade part.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He has a pearl gold torso (with gold arms and flesh hands). The torso has printing on both sides, with great detail everywhere.</p>
<p>He has&nbsp;olive green legs (which is a very rare leg color).&nbsp;Along with the torso, the legs have&nbsp;very good printing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>He is also the first minifig to have brown elf hair (which is a very intricate and awesome piece BTW). </p>
<p>He is has a double sided head, one side is a casual smile and the other side seams to be a yelling emotion. </p>
<p>All these this are great, but there is one problem to this minifig.&nbsp; He comes with a SHORT cape, instead of the long cape he is pictured with. Nonetheless he is only the second minifig to have a dark blue short cape (Barriss Offee being the first).</p>
<p>Regardless of the cape being short, Elrond is one of my favorite minifigures of all time!</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,4,5

"Sauron_Bauglir","2012-12-31T00:02:19.23Z","The should-have-been High King of the Ñoldor deserves a better figure!","<p>Elrond is one of my favourite Lord of the Rings characters, and one of the most powerful &amp; important. &nbsp;Therefore, he deserves one of the best, most well thought out Lego minifigures. &nbsp;But on the contrary- he got a bad colour scheme, and problems with the parts!</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Elrond came with no box/instructions, just a plastic bag attached to the video game box.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The parts you are supposed to get for Elrond are not bad, but not great. &nbsp;The cape is nice, and the head, hair and body, but Lego could have done better. &nbsp;But the colour of the legs that they gave Elrond is some sickly shade of green, which looks terrible and wrong! &nbsp;It puts me off the figure a bit...</div><div><br></div><div>Then there is the- quite good- dark blue cape you are supposed to get. &nbsp;Instead of a full-sized cape, I was given a Hobbit-sized cape, which looks wrong and TERRIBLE! &nbsp;I swapped it for a black cape which I already had, which looks almost dark blue, but not brilliant. &nbsp;This was a major flaw in this figure.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Elrond holding his Elven sword, which doesn't look very swordy, is hard to stand up without a Lego plate to put him on. &nbsp;He is a good minifigure, although flawed.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Obviously, there wasn't much to build...</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>I was quite&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;with this minifigure for Lord Elrond Half-Elven, and I thought it could have been much better. &nbsp;I am looking forward to 'The Council of Elrond' set in 2013!! &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,5
