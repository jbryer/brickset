"Odeinoichus","2012-11-25T11:39:16.67Z","Master the Art of Spinjitzu","<p>LEGO Ninjago Character Encyclopedia: Right now in Canada this book can be found at Costco for 10$, that's a huge value for this thing. You can't pass it up at that price.</p>
<p>The book includes 176 pages of Ninjago Set, Character and Mythology information in a fun looking presentation as well as the ultra rare Green Ninja ZX Ultimate Powered up Form Mini-Figure. There's pages of information on every single set from NINJAGO found in 2011 and 2012 (and even a short few pages on what to expect in 2013, though without any spoilers or boxed images of those sets.)</p>
<p>It's pretty informative, as usual with DK books there is a great level of love and hard work put into this piece of lore. There may or may not be some typos, I'm not 100% sure on this, however I do recall from experience that sometimes a bit of the printed material is a bit rushed and so some mistakes can be made. DK has a habit of making really great LEGO books with only a few tiny nitpicks for older fans who really pay attention and catalogue everything on sites like Brickset. For children however those few mistakes are easily overlooked or barely notiecable.</p>
<p>The exclusive Mini-Figure offered in this book is pretty clever actually. It's Lloyd the Green Ninja dressed in his Ultimate Form outfit, black and gold with green coloring. Like all Exclusive Mini-Figs found in the DK LEGO Books he does not include any accessories. It would have also been nice to get a special card for the NINJAGO Spinner Game of this Mini-Fig as a bonus too. I've really taken to the cards found in Spinner and Booster Packs for the game, and that extra bit more here would have been nice to see. Overall though I'd have to say this book is just well worth tracking down, especially for Costco pricing. There is a lot of useful facts, great pictures of the sets and information on the mythology behind the Ninjago Phenomena. I definitely recommend this one for youger fans and those of us who can't get enough of these brilliantly constructed DK LEGO Books.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,1,4
