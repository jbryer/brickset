<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Regular clock-setting instructions only.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One part, and it does not come apart.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One maxi-sized figure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>just insert batteries LOL</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Tells time well, but the alarm does little to wake a 22-yr old girl child to make her go to work on time.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If I can find the Vampire for cheap, I&#39;ll pick it up too, and maybe the both of them can get this kid to go to work on time.</p>
