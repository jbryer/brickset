"oldfan","2013-07-25T12:18:14.4Z","You have to start somewhere...","<p>70400 Forest Ambush is the starter or &quot;army-builder&quot; set of the latest Castle series (2013 edition). &nbsp;Just like all the other similar sets from other themes, the main components are the mini-figures, in this case generic soldiers for each faction, and a handful of other small builds to give the mini-figures something to do while waiting for the owner to cough up enough dough to purchase one of the larger sets in the theme. &nbsp;But I digress... let&#39;s see what you get in this little set:</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>-Two men for the &quot;standard&quot; faction, and two more for the &quot;adversary&quot; faction (who am I to say who is good and bad?). &nbsp;Unfortunately, the 2013 Castle theme seems to merely recycle the factions and color schemes from previous themes, although the&nbsp;&quot;dragon&quot; faction has a neat-looking logo for its shield.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>-Flick-fire missiles, ever-present in today&#39;s LEGO, find their way into this little set as well. &nbsp;At least the designer tried to disguise them as crossbow bolts, launched from the black unit mounted on the small hidden wall, so I give full credit for trying.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>-Lots of accessories to flesh out the set. &nbsp;The new (to me) broadsword is a subtle upgrade from the original but looks great. &nbsp;I miss the old printed chrome coins from the classic castle days, but I&#39;m sure it&#39;s more cost effective to use the new round 1x1 tiles in the gold color instead. &nbsp;Flags, treasure chest, cart, gems, goblet, and an assortment of weapons for all included figures round out the selection.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>-The collapsing tree feature, constructed out of Technic pieces, is a nice touch for such a small set. &nbsp;Watch out for the falling apple, Newton!</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>This set has a single purpose, to build up your medieval armies, and accomplishes the task well for the price point. &nbsp;If you&#39;re going to build in the new 2013 Castle theme, you&#39;ll want at least one of these sets in your collection.</div>

"lkb57","2013-07-27T00:09:19.393Z","Ambush!","<p>Ever since the new LOTR/Hobbit sets have started rolling out, I've wanted to start beefing up my collection of castle and medieval related bricks, minifigs and accessories. Weighing in at FOUR minifigs (plus a dog) for a price that usually gets you two minifigs (three if you're lucky), this set is a must-have for anyone trying to build a medieval army. On the other hand, you only get 90 pieces total . . . so the $11.99 price tag can seem a bit steep. Just depends on what you're looking for in a set, I suppose.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Meh . . . I bought it for the minifigs and the pieces.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>On the one hand, this set comes with some pretty commonplace pieces . . . on the other hand, it does provide a range of pieces necessary for building outdoor scenes (brown technic pieces, large/small leaf pieces, etc.). Additionally, you get an apple, seven gold ""coin"" pieces, and three jewel pieces.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>These really make the set. Three of the four minifigs have reversible faces and you get two soldiers from each opposing army. Additionally, you can kit your minifigs with a variety of weapons (two swords, one spear, one axe, one crossbow, one ball-and-chain, two shields). And it comes with a dog. Not really sure how the canine figures into the ambush, but a nice touch.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is quick, but there are no repetitions, so it is engaging from the start. The ambush hiding place includes a tipping tree and flick-fire missiles. Both the hiding place and the cart are surprisingly fun to put together. It took me maybe ten minutes to get it all together, and then BAM! you have an awesome medieval scene right in front of you.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks good, but honestly the parts you gain from the purchase are worth more (IMO) than the sum of the build.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you're putting together an army, this set is a must-have. Otherwise, save up for one of the bigger castle sets, or for an LOTR/Hobbit set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"Firox_5000","2014-01-18T19:37:46.14Z","Ambush In The Forest!","This is the first and only set I've purchased of the first wave of Lego Castle sets which costs a fairly reasonable £7.99 for four figures, a small battle wagon and a tree structure.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The set comes in a small square box which is a similar size to all £8-£10 sets released during 2013.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are four figures included in this set, two of which are the good knights. One features a tall pointed helmet, with front silver and blue &nbsp;torso printing with a crown in the foreground and a belt plus silvery armour printing on the back of the torso. The face print see's a standard looking face with sideburns too. There's no leg printing. This figure uses a sword as a weapon.</div><div><br></div><div>The second good knight features a fat round helmet, a smirk like facial expression and also silver and blue torso printing on the front and back of the torso, but no leg printings. This figure uses a spike as a weapon.</div><div><br></div><div>There are also two bad knight figures, the first features a wedged open helmet with silver and black front torso printing with a bull logo on the front too with additional silver printing on the back with no printing on the legs. The figure houses a slightly shocked facial expression with a few scars and some stubble too. He figure uses a mace as a weapon. There's also a more evil face printed on the back of the head too.</div><div><br></div><div>The second bad knight features a pointed helmet similar to the first good knight but in a darker silver colour. Two facial expressions are on the head, one with a serious looking face and the other with an evil smirk whilst having printed reddish &nbsp;sideburns too. The front torso is nearly identical to the first bad knight, but the back torso features more brown printing. The figure features a plain black leg piece too with no printing. This figure comes equipped with an axe and shield.</div><div><br></div><div>There are two structural elements included in this set, the first is the small battle wagon which uses the medieval style wheels and includes storage space at the back and sides as well as a handle at front to help the good knights pull it along plus a blue and gold flag. There's also a treasure chest which includes cups, coins and jewelry. Unfortunately, the coins are not silvery gold like the old ones we saw years ago in old sets.</div><div><br></div><div>The second set element is the small forest hideout area which has a few play features including a small tree made of lots of brown and green pieces, plus an apple which can be pushed down by simply leaning it towards the ground.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There's also a hideout area with &nbsp;an arrow and shrubbery piece plus another feature which is the flick fire, however unlike the falling tree feature doesn't really blend in to the set well and feels like it was just thrown in for play value.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this is a great little castle set and despite its size features lots if figures and playability action with all the element and features. Certainly one I'd recommend for all castle fans, army builders and those who are not sure they will buy the 2013 castle theme or just want knights from that series.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"Ernst","2013-08-18T09:06:56.77Z","Forest Ambush, the Castle 2013 starter kit.","<p><strong>Overall&nbsp;4 bricks</strong>: the smallest set of latest Castle theme (no subtheme ?) is nice as army builder but as set in total a bit disappointing in my opinion. On the other side it is not fair to compare it with the LotR and Hobbit&nbsp;theme which you easily do, this serie is more for the younger Lego fan. Looking at it that way it is ok considering content and result, the RRP in Holland being &euro;10.99 is a bit too high even with 4 mini figures.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong>: not a great effort needed for the building of this set. The first mission is the treasure cart and the second built is the small wall with the tree trap.&nbsp;Three bricks are sufficient here.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong>: The set offers 4 brand new mini figures (2 with double faces)&nbsp;with sufficient weapons although 1 more extra shield would have been welcome. A nice small green <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemIn.asp?P=32059&amp;in=S"">baseplate</a>&nbsp;and a lot of accessories like the treasure, the dog and green leaf parts.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>: 4 Well armored Knights, a treasure cart and a bad guys hiding place with a&nbsp;trap offer great playing possibilities. 5 Bricks are in place here.</p>

<p><strong>Value&nbsp;3 bricks</strong>: Even with the 4 mini figures a bit overpriced, a good advice is to wait some time if you have the patience. This type of sets will be in the discount boxes for a more reasonable price being &euro;7,50.</p>

<p>No problems with the box or instructions. No missing pieces and the instruction booklet wasn&#39;t bent.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some nice pieces to have in this set, such as the tree pieces and wagon wheels and flag pieces are also good to have. There are also gold coins- sadly not the ones with the coin value on then, but still nice- and some gem pieces. The colors are what you would expect from a forest-themed castle set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The first mini figure is the dragon knight with the shield. He is the latest reincarnation of the dragon knights. He has a red and black color scheme and Is&nbsp;very well printed, with a nice looking dragon emblem on the center of the shield and on his torso</p>

<p>the next minifigure is the dragon knight with the mace. First of all, the mace is a great weapon to have, and is just the weapon for such an evil looking dragon knight. His torso has slightly different printing than the other dragon knight, and it still looks nice.</p>

<p>The cart carrying lion knight (also another remade type of knight) has a great silver helmet along with a quartered/breastplate torso. These lion knights have a blue and silver color scheme.</p>

<p>The last figure has a nice rounded helmet, which is also in silver. He has chainmail printing and a nice shield with a lion emblem on it.</p>

<p>The dog is a normal lego dog with the exception of having black printing to make it look like a German Shepard.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was quick and easy, but for a $12 set came with a pretty sizeable one. There isn&#39;t really any repeats with the build and takes no more than 10 minutes to complete, even for novice builders.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The tree is a formidable ambush station.&nbsp;It has some nice play features, including a classic flick fire missile( out of place in a castle set it seems) and a falling tree.</p>

<p>The spear cart is a nice little addition and it includes many fun little treasures and some flags.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set with a lot of playability and even thought it is more for the figures, the little side parts are great additions.</p>

"Linley98","2018-12-23T14:55:00.24Z","Great Army building set!","<p>This set is suitable for building up your LEGO castle army, and is where you should start if you want to get into this theme.</p>

<p>This set contains 4 mini figures two dragons and two lions, all very good mini figures with my favorite&nbsp;being&nbsp;cas516: King&#39;s Knight Breastplate. The dog is also a nice addition to the set which you can use to track&nbsp;down the dragon knights. All these minifigures come with different weapons, and there&#39;s two sheilds.</p>

<p>The tree can collapse&nbsp;onto the road which the cart is going down allowing the dragon knights to ambush the King&#39;s/lion&nbsp;knights. It can also fire a project, the tree is great for playability!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is my favorite&nbsp;set in this release of LEGO castle, which I have brought 6 of to build an army! Would recommend.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Deep in the heart of the realm of Lego Castle is a little forest that is calm and peacefull, were the birds sing and the squirrels store their nuts for winter... or so it seemed to the two Lion Knights transporting the kings treasure to the little outpost* far, far away from the Kings Castle*. But lurking in the foliage were two Dragon Knights with a crossbow hidden on a camaflauged wall of logs and stone, ready to fire it at the traveling Lion Knights and steal the treasure. As they approached the hidden wall the faithful German shepherd dog the two Lion knights had with them as protection, began barking angrily and sniffed around the ground twoard the camouflaged hide out.</p>

<p>&quot; What&#39;s gotten into him?&quot; Wondered the younger Lion Knight who pulled the little cart with the treasure on it. This was his first week as a real knight. &quot;Lookout!&quot; Cries the older knight who carried a lance and was now posing in battle position.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;A small tree in the midst of dense shrubs and bramble suddenly came falling down no less than a foot in front of the young knight. Next came a soft snap then a gentle whizzzzz and out went a bolt from brush and the young knight barely missed being skewered by it if he hadn&#39;t heard the snap of the crossbow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, a large leafy branch was pushed back and two dragon knights lunged forth with their weapons raised. The dog dashed forward and bit down hard on the Axe wielding dragon knights leg. But before the young knight could draw his sword the same axe came crashing down on his helm and he went out like a light.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;After a struggle between the older knight and the Mace wielding dragon knight, who battered violently on the lion knights shield with his mace, it was over. Mace (the dragon knight) quickly slammed his opponent to the ground with one hard swing of his weapon which knocked the Older knight unconcsious. The dragon knights (one with a big dog bite in his leg) tied up the two Lion knights and locked them inside of a prison carriage* they had hidden nearby and loaded the stolen treasure onto the back of it. Then they were off, with the carriage rattling off down the old dirt road, celebrating their victory. But it wouldn&#39;t last long for when they would pass the Last Lion Outpost* they would encounter tougher enemies than those they had just defeated......</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And yes, a story-Review is what you have just read. I will be doing more of these, I think. So, the set is overall a really cool set. The collapsing tree function works fine, and when you flick the missile or bolt below the crossbow, it goes pretty far but sometimes you have to flick it just right to send it flying. The carts wheels spin freely and aren&#39;t loose. Sets like this one are small but very good sets when added to a larger collection, and I thought, if lego ever does Castle again they won&#39;t be sorry if they make sets like this one plus larger one like the Gatehouse Raid.</p>

"Lego_Photos_X","2022-09-17T20:48:20.28Z","Awesome For Army Building!","<p>Just buy a bunch of these sets, and you have already a huge Castle III army.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is from 2013 era (Castle III). I personally really like this set, because of the minifigures. It&#39;s just so great for army building. There are four&nbsp;<em>(4)</em>&nbsp;minifigures in this set. My favourite being CAS516&nbsp;<em>(The one from Lion Knight Side).&nbsp;</em>This set only cost back then 10.99&euro;, which is just so cheap! 4 Minifigures for 11,99&euro; would be nowadays impossible. Normal Star Wars battle packs cost 16.99&euro; today... it&#39;s just ridiculous. Also, there is that ambush build in this set too. It has a tree, that can fall down&nbsp;<em>(Maybe Lions shoot to it, or then just Dragons will break it down, to stop Lion Knights). </em>The ambush has also&nbsp;shooter... it works just like any of those creatures worked back then. Glad that we don&#39;t see those too usually nowadays. Well, then there are just some plants and a crossbow, so they can shoot Lion soldiers. Now to the waggons <em>(or whatever they are)</em>. I really like the design of this one! It looks super cool &amp; works with older kingdoms from Castle as well&nbsp;<em>(I mean you can change the blue parts into other colour &amp; it still looks nice!)</em>. There is a treasure on it and it has some treasure&nbsp;<em>(Red, Green &amp; Yellow Diamonds, Gold and Golden Gablet)</em>&nbsp;in it. Then there is just a gold-blue flag on it. Nothing too much, but looks awesome! There is also a dog also included in this set. I think it&#39;s a nice extra.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth it, even if you were only buying one of them. I would recommend! 9,5/10 for army building. Just for buying one&nbsp;set I would still give 9/10.</p>
