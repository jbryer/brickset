"Ernst","2015-02-07T09:12:06.313Z","Gold Getaway ? I call it : Prisoner Carriage","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks</strong> : A nice additional set to the 2013 Castle theme. Not a real must have set but useful considering the parts content and for the younger Lego fan loads of playability. The price is ok considering the content with 3 mini figures and a horse. Overall a very acceptable set for a reasonable price.</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks</strong> : First is the build of the little outpost, a very small building which could have been a bit bigger. It is just big enough to place a small knight in it, a bit bigger so you can hide the crossbow behind it would have been better. The prisoner carriage is a strong, great looking vehicle on a good scale. It hides a surprising (in my opinion unrealistic and unnecessary) shooting device but it stays a nice carriage. The built is all with small parts so pleasant and good for every age. I like the way how&nbsp;the horse is attached to the cart, a new possibility instead of the old fashioned use of the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2397"">horse hitching part</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong> : Nothing really spectacular but all very good and useful parts with the new horse,&nbsp;3 nice mini figures with a sufficient amount of weapons. The parts used for the outpost and carriage are useful in every way. We also have a well filled treasure chest, a whip and a frog.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : All a kid needs for hours of fun with this single set. Two opposite factions with a carriage, a small building and a big crossbow. So 5 bricks well deserved and also a set to be added to other Castle sets.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks </strong>: The price is reasonable but it can always be better. With a bigger outpost or an extra Dragon Knight it would have been 5 bricks or a discount to &euro; 15,00. We stay human so will always find something to complain about the price.</p>

<p>is an excellent set and is worth the money</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Building Experience!</b></p>

<p>This set is surprisingly fun to build, the cart and outpost is fun with the angles on them and the cart is satisfying at the end of the build</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts!</b></p>

<p>As a lover of the fantasy era of sets the parts are really useful, I&rsquo;m building my own medieval kingdom and these are some of the only knight parts I have, along with the LEGO movie Castle set. The shield, helmet and uniforms are useful and the treasure is a nice addition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a really Fun, Happy set. It&rsquo;s more a carriage ambush then gold getaway but the name explains the gold, the missile play feature is fun to try to hit a moving cart!</p>
