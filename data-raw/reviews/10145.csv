"Ernst","2014-01-23T12:25:35.353Z","The Gatehouse Raid, not a must have but a decent set","<p><strong>Overall&nbsp;4 bricks</strong>: A nice set in this Castle line but without&nbsp;any real special parts or originality. It has good playability, sufficient mini figures and has a reasonable price. Useful as army builder and to improve the big Castle, for MOC fans a good price per piece. Overall a mediocre set so 3 bricks&nbsp;would normally be&nbsp;sufficient. The fact that this is the only set with a horse barding for the Dragon Knights makes it a bit more attractive so 4 bricks.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong>: Building is no big challenge, first thing is the catapult which is no real building but assembling. After that the Gatehouse consisting of 3 parts: the 2 sidewalls and the main entrance with 2 lattice doors a small catapult on the first floor and a crown on the top floor. The 3 separate parts are connected with pins.</p>

<p><strong>Parts&nbsp;4 bricks</strong>: All useful Castle parts, 4 very good mini figures with sufficient weapons and great shields. An extra remark for the first new horse barding of the Dragon Knights brings me to the 4 bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>: this wave of Castle sets is in my view more for the younger playing Lego fans than for the AFOL and this set proves it. It has great playing content with opposite Knights, a catapult, a small jail etc. so 5 bricks are in place here.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks</strong>: I bought it for &euro;23,95 which is a normal price so 3 bricks here, <span class=""hps"">it</span> <span class=""hps"">is neither</span> <span class=""hps"">expensive</span> <span class=""hps"">nor cheap</span><span>,</span> <span class=""hps"">just</span> <span class=""hps"">the right price.</span></p>

"aredotam","2014-12-17T02:46:38.5Z","Pleasant Gatehouse, But the Minifigures Make the Set","<p>The Gatehouse Raid is good mid-sized Castle set. The Gatehouse itself is a nice looking piece (although I have some reservations about it below) and the knight minifigures included are fabulous. This set also comes with a horse, which can be hard to find without buying larger sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>Minifigures: I bought this set mostly for the minifigs and they didn&rsquo;t disappoint. The minifigs for this Castle theme are a good combination of old and new elements. One of the King&rsquo;s Knights comes with a classic helmet, large shield, and removable armor. The torso and legs are printed with new colors and designs. The lion emblems on the armor and shield are also new. The other King&rsquo;s Knight has a previously seen helmet, and only its upper torso has printing on it &ndash; although the design is also new. One of the Dragon Knights has all the elements of the first King&rsquo;s Knight &ndash; classic helmet, large shield, removable armor &ndash; in a black and red color scheme. The torso and legs of the first Dragon Knight have new printed patterns. The armor and large shield are adorned with the new dragon emblem. The second Dragon Knight also has a classic helmet, and its torso is a copy of the other Dragon Knights&rsquo;. However the second Dragon Knight only has black legs. Lego created some new weapons for this Castle theme. The King&rsquo;s Knights and Dragon Knights in this set have newly designed swords which add a nice touch. The spears, however, are the same as ever.</p>

<p>Horse: The Gatehouse Raid comes with a black horse for the Dragon Knights. The horse comes with a newly designed body and head armor. Perhaps the most innovative feature is the fact that the horses can now move their back legs (not individually) which means they can assume multiple poses.</p>

<p>Gatehouse Catapult: This catapult has a brand new launching mechanism. A small rubber piece is placed on the axle which makes the catapult spring up. This makes firing the catapult easier, especially because it&rsquo;s in a confined space.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Prison: The size of the prison cell is large enough for a minifig to sit or stand, and has a cool lock piece that snaps onto the key hole/handle of the door.</p>

<p>Dragon Knight Catapult: This catapult doesn&rsquo;t look like much, and isn&rsquo;t a complex build, but it does fire easily and has some range if hit hard enough.</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>Durability: As stated above, the Gatehouse is a very nice looking building. The roof sections, archway, &ldquo;brick&rdquo; bricks, and various banners are well done indeed. But it has some structural issues that bother me. The Gatehouse is built in three sections that snap together. The shorter side sections are solid and can actually be swapped. However the central piece (with the gate and tower) is unstable, particularly during the building stage. The tower is supported only by 1x4x1 bricks (or a combination of bricks to form the same dimensions) which had a tendency to come apart when applying pressure. Even after construction the tower&rsquo;s durability is suspect when not attached to the side sections.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a good Castle set. With four minifigures, horse, and easily handled Gatehouse this set has great playability with lots of possibility. The Gatehouse makes a great front line of defense for a castle or fort, or a standalone outpost. I would recommend this set to any Castle collector or Lego fan.</p>
