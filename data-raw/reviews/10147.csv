"Falcon_Knight","2013-08-13T20:38:02.48Z","King's Castle","<p>This is my first castle which I got for the free hot dog stand in July. It was out of stock, so I got it by mail. It's a great size, though I wish it came on a normal baseplate, instead of those thick ""plates"". I ended up spending all my money on it but I don't regret buying it.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>There were three instruction booklets, very easy to understand. One of the instruction booklets was much longer, for some reason.<br></p><p>…</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Great selection of pieces; some new (short chains, slopes near the gatehouse, portcullis, new horse w/ barding &amp; helm, etc.), some old, like the modular wall pieces. A very nice selection of spare accessories including a bottle, an axe, a ladder, and a spear.<br></p><p>…</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><ul><li><b>King</b>: A new face, old with wrinkles, less serious than the Kingdoms one. The crown is a ""warm gold"", a nice dark blue cape is included. The torso print is unique and has some creases on the back. The legs have a belt and some diamond-shaped padding. He has a gold LOTR longsword, a nice touch<br></li><li><b>Knight: </b>The knight has the same helm as in Dragon mountain, a metallic helm with a light stone grey visor and a blue plume. His face is the same as one of the robbers in the 2012 city line, and the breastplate is very nice. The torso is the same as in Forest Ambush and Gold Getaway, a nice small chestplate with a crown insignia on a blue/white tunic. The legs have a belt and kneeplates. He has the new style of sword and a well-detailed shield.<br></li><li><b>Crossbowman: </b>The crossbowman has the classic neck-protector helm and a crooked smile. He seems to have the same tunic as the one under the breastplates of the knight, but has a nice belt with a crown on it. He has grey legs with a black middle. He also has a spare crossbow but no quiver : (</li><li><b>Archer: </b>The bowman has the relatively new helmet which is detailed and has a something to provide shade in (?). He has a ""smirk"" with stubble and some chain mail with a little bit of armor. He has the same pants as the crossbowman, and has a bow and quiver?.</li></ul><b><i></i></b><br><ul><li><b>Dragon Knight:</b> The leader has bushy eyebrows and a goatee, all covered by the 2010 - introduced closed helm in black. His breastplate is nicely printed, and underneath is some chain mail with a bit of armor and a silver belt. The legs continue the chain mail have some knee armor. He has the King's sword but in dark grey and a small shield.</li><li><b>Dragon Axe-Wielding Soldier:</b> This soldier has a black neck-protector helmet, red sideburns and stubble. He has the same armor as the Dragon Knight but without the breastplate. He also sports an axe<br></li><li><b>Dragon Soldier w/ Mace-and-Chain:</b> The other soldier has a bit of stubble and a cheek-protector helm. His armor is chain mail, with a brown belt. He has plain black legs and a mace-and-chain. Obviously he's a lower-ranking soldier. <br></li></ul>All the figs have back printing and are very detailed, and the dragon soldiers have double-sided heads.<br><p>…</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was kind of boring, the two sections of wall were identical except for the collapsing wall chunk (I took that out). The towers all had the same strategy, and there were far too many stickers. The hardest part was cutting the string for the portcullis. The gatehouse and rear tower took two to three bags.<br></p><p>…</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><ul><li><b>The Walls: </b>The walls have a larger square in the corner. They're a bit low, but still so much fun to put the guards on.</li><li><b>Gatehouse: </b>The drawbridge gets jammed if you raise it too high, the little room is just to house the mechanisms, and the space around it is almost too small for minifigs. However, portcullis works well and the gatehouse has a good design overall. The drawbridge is pulled by strings and the king thought it was a good idea to have some of the structure and a flag-holder (which is pointless because of the banner) made of gold.<br></li><li><b>Catapult Tower: </b>There's spare room on the bottom, a small table with a technic rubber stick protruding from it to power the catapult. The catapult has a mechanism which involves pushing down the catapult to bend the stick, then release to make the ammunition fly off. It works well, but makes the puny table look even worse.</li><li><b>Rear Tower: </b>The rear tower is the tallest. The one thing I don't understand is why there's a drawbridge and portcullis at the gatehouse&nbsp; while in the rear, there's a wooden door. I always wondered why the ""villains"" go through the trouble of going through the front gate when there's a small door on the other side. The only way to fix that is to modify the tower or scrap it to replace it with the Gatehouse Raid set. The second floor has a throne which looks strange and cannot accommodate the king with his cape. The third floor has two keys right next to the door to the treasury, with some new chrome gold pieces and gems. The door that the keys unlock. Smart. No wonder the dragon knights steal. It's just too easy. The top would be a nice place if it wasn't for the torch right in the middle of the tower. This is the only tower without a banner.<br></li><li><b>Dungeon: </b>The dungeon is a large jail cell at the bottom of the tower. It's the largest room in the castle, and could be a better treasury than the original ""treasure room"". Though is it really the best idea to keep your enemies within your walls? There's some space in the tower, and the top has a crossbow held in place with yet another piece of gold. Why are there three archery weapons yet only one quiver?</li><li><b>Siege Weapon</b>: A small bonus, this machine has one movement. the battering ram hits the castle and pushes the catapult to fling the same ammunition as the castle's catapult.</li></ul><i>Dragon Knight: ""There are three ways to invade the castle: 1. Cut the drawbridge strings and ram through the gate; 2. Get captured and escape into the castle; 3. Burn the back door.""</i><br><br>This set is divided into all 6 parts (2 walls) and can be adjusted into a square, rectangle, an open castle, or a long wall if you don't mind some of the walls reversed.<br><p>…</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would recommend getting this set if you have other sets from this line or Fantasy Era. It's huge, has lots of accessories, and is very impressive.&nbsp;</p><p>~<i><b>Falcon Knight </b></i><br></p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,5

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Rather unexciting pieces, the most interesting ones probably being the horse, its robe and the lattice in titanium metallic.<br />
However this isn&#39;t a set filled with small parts to up the pieces count, most pieces are of decent size, and you get the most 4x5 panels of any set in any color (21), the second most 3x3x6 panels of any set (18), a lot of plates including 10 &quot;10x10&quot; octogonal ones and a ton of windows in various shapes.<br />
Also, this set includes a pretty worthy treasure, not ones filled with studs, but with chrome gold coins, as well as a chrome gold ingot and 2 rubys.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You probably won&#39;t buy this for the minifigs. They are good, but none is outstanding and most are generic. They all have backprinting and a few only have legs printings. All the baddies have double sided faces with different expressions, but not the lion knights. Some of them share the same prints. The best pieces are the armour which are very well printed (on the front only). The crown is a different one, in a warm gold rather than chrome gold and looks suitably metallic, though less shiny, still pretty nice. The sword doesn&#39;t look as convincing in pearl gold.</p>

<p>7 minifigs is way too little for a castle this size.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very, very, VERY easy. Actually maybe my easiest build since I came out of my dark age. About next to nothing when it comes to advanced technic, very minimal detailing, quite repetitive with some sections being almost identical. The right pieces are overall easy to find, even with the thousand of them mixed in a box. At least, you won&#39;t have a hard time with this one. And there are 10 (!) bags. Less than 100 pieces per bag. For comparison I think kingdom joust had 8 bags. For 1575 pieces.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a more than decent size model, I think the dimensions are about 30cm on a side, over 35 on the other and 25cm high. It looks pretty flawless from all angles, except for the rear of the gate which has a hole. Of course you still have to fly to get on the towers, but at least there is a ladder this time.</p>

<p>The towers are rather simple and not very big, but the gate is like a whole building by itself. To be fair, taken separately, the modular parts are unimpressive, except for the gate, but when assembled, it looks rather good.</p>

<p>The dark tan mason bricks, redish brown log bricks and bright blue cheese slope nicely breaks the monotony of a model which would otherwise be too grey.</p>

<p>The model has a nice modularity, though there are mosty 2 possible layouts, the walls and towers can then be swapped for more variability.</p>

<p>Also, if you simply rebuild one of the wall as a mirror of the other (easily done without any extra pieces), you can experiment with 4 new layouts :</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff327/Fauch_/DSC04468_zpsbwoehhhk.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 333px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff327/Fauch_/DSC04467_zpspttpsof7.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 333px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the criticisms, first there is not a lot of details. You have some empty rooms (others contain a table, a treasure, a throne and a prison), still, it is open for customisation. Second, this looks very clean, borderline clinical, compared to the worn look of a Helm&#39;s deep for example. At worst,I know everyone hates them, but extra stickers could have been the easy way to improve on this.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a castle, so it&#39;s pretty good, though this one is definitely not trying to be original. Best part is the gate with a working drawbridge and lattice that you actionnate&nbsp;by turning levers. The mechanisms are pretty well concealed inside the model. The drawbridge can get jammed and could require some hand help.</p>

<p>The catapult on the castle can&#39;t rotate and I think don&#39;t have a lot of power.</p>

<p>There is a removable wall on the side. Quite a bit obvious as it&#39;s the only bit looking different from the rest.</p>

<p>There is a prison, it is a rather large one.</p>

<p>There is a door at the back.</p>

<p>The dragon catapult can be used to throw rocks or ram into the castle. It fires when you push the head. It works pretty well, better than your average Lego catapult.</p>

<p>Overall this offers the minimum you can expect from a castle, though castles offer nice playability.</p>

<p>7 minifigs&nbsp;is too few.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Nice for the price. Useful pieces. Looks almost flawless but too clean. Well adapted to children but nice on display as well.</p>

"Altair1970","2015-10-10T09:05:06.68Z","A good castle for kids","<p>I bought this castle last X-mas for my six-year-old son.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice box, my son was jumping all around when he saw it first!</p>

<p>Instructions are clear, no particular problem.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are a lot (7), the best ones being the King and the Knight with his horse - very well done.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fun build, not too repetitive as the castle is asymmetric.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Impressive castle, maybe just a bit too colorful to be realistic (a lot of blue)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A bit expensive (around 100 Euros), but nice gift for a small kid, very good playability. Be prepared to be asked to get also a red dragon to assist the bad guys!</p>
