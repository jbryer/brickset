"Legolijntje","2014-02-20T11:40:05.21Z","Original set that looks a little weird","<p>This is one of the few 2013 Chima sets that weren&#39;t as widely available as the other Chima sets. I don&#39;t know why. When you look at the set number, it indicates it&#39;s one of the buildable sets, but at the same time it&#39;s also part the Speedorz sets. So I was in doubt if I should buy it, since I&#39;m interested in the buildable Chima sets and no the Speedorz. In the end, I&#39;m glad I bought it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing very special to mention here. It&#39;s a normal box (with very nice orange lion printing on one side and grey wolf printing on the other side). The instructions are also just like any other LEGO instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts consist mainly of plates, bricks and slopes. It is a nice parts pack with a variety of parts. The parts come in three bags, numbered 1, 2 and 3.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are very good. I like Ewald very much. It&#39;s quite different from the other eagles and it&#39;s only available in this sets. Worriz is also very nice with it&#39;s cape and also only available in this set. Lennox is also very good, but not as interesting as the other two, it comes in one other set (except the minifig pack).&nbsp; The printing on all figures is very good.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is mostly stacking plates, bricks and slopes on each other. It isn&#39;t very special and it doesn&#39;t include any noteworthy things.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks quite good. When I saw the images, I was expecting a very skeletel model, but it&#39;s not that bad. I don&#39;t like the fact that the eagle head looks a lot different and a lot less detailed as in the eagle vehicles.</p>

<p>It includes a very cool mechanism to spread the wings. You have to retract the wings when you are going to play with this set. When one of the players hits the little tower on the front, the wings spread out indicating someon has won. It doesn&#39;t indicate who has won. That would&#39;ve been cool, but I understand the choice, since it would make the model a lot more complicated and maybe even not possible within the parts range/price.</p>

<p>The tower on the back looks a little weird. I don&#39;t know why, it just doesn&#39;t feel like a &quot;Eagle Castle&quot; like the set name suggests.</p>

<p>Although the model looks cool and works good, the Speedorz are very difficult to use. They go everywhere except where I want them to go. The quality of the Speedorz is good though.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all it&#39;s a nice set. A bit difficult to use for what&#39;s it intended to do, but it works good though. If you&#39;re a Chima collector, you should pick this up as quickly as possible, since it&#39;s a limited retail set. If you&#39;re not, it&#39;s a nice set that kids can play with. It&#39;s a bit more interesting than the other Speedorz sets. As a normal buildable set (like the vehicles and croc/lion hideouts) this set is a bit dissapointing.</p>
