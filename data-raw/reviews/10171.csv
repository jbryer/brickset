Its stayed in very good shape over the years and still works sturdily, you can fit a surprisingly large amount of bricks insider and it doesn&#39;t make too much noise to walk around with. It stores duplo as well. The logo is nice, its nice and tactile to feel. Overall its fun to use and looks very nice with vintage lego piles. Although I don&#39;t see much reason to get it today</p>
