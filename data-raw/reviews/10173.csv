The game designers did an awesome job making Middle Earth and all the great stuff that's inside it, which you can explore like Gotham City in Batman 2.&nbsp; There are many new features in this game including that many characters have multiple items that you can switch too, there are quest in Middle Earth that give you stuff, you can forge items with Mithril bricks into cool objects that everyone can use, and you can find other items in levels that anyone can use as well.&nbsp; Like other LEGO games, you can replay each level in search of treasures, but in this game you also search for designs that give you more things to forge and items that you can collect and use (they are often humorous objects like a rubber duck and a bugle hat).<br><br>Pros:<br>Great story with fun, adventurous levels<br>Can replay levels to find treasures, designs, and items<br>Lots of characters to play with<br>Can explore Middle Earth<br>Can go on quest to get Red and Mithril Bricks<br>Characters gain new abilities and objects as the story progresses<br>Build your own character section has a wide variety choices<br>Talking minifigures<br>Can throw Gimli<br>Characters like Gandalf have cool new ability of magic<br>Has animal races for Mithril bricks<br><br>Cons:<br>The characters can't swim, so traveling in Middle Earth is sometimes tough<br><br>Overall, it is the best LEGO video game yet.&nbsp; I give it 10/10!&nbsp; I recommend this game to anyone.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
