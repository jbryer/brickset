<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>the price:&nbsp;this set is only&nbsp;$ 3.49. roughly the price of just one of the minifigure packs.</li><li>the minifigure. The chest plate on it is awsome!</li><li>the design of the mech is great! the trooper sits perfectly in the mech seat, not to mention the presents of to lasers on the mech!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>no gun. granted, the mech does have to lasers mounted on it, but what about for the minifigure himself? not a big deal, but still note worthy.</li><li>there is a clear block under the mech that is suppose to help it stand up. although i dont think it needs any support on its legs they work fine!</li><li>Nothing {i cant think of any more cons}</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in conclution i would recomend this set to anyone who likes&nbsp;the space or star wars themes. Also, as you can tell, this is simply a impulse set or an army builder. it is possible to buy them in bulk, which i recomend. </p><p>I hope you enjoyed my first real review of a set on brickset!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4

"TheFadedTBCap","2013-12-28T13:53:23.383Z","Great Mini Space Machine","I found this set at Target and for under $5, I had to get it. &nbsp;It is a fun little set that is worth the money.

"tkettle9719","2013-08-10T20:27:28.097Z","Galaxy Squad: 30230: Mini Mech REVIEW","<p>I got this set for free from LegoShop.com offers for a $50 purchase. Although very small and lacking of any real detail, this is a nice little set. It looks like a useful little mech to eradicate any small alien soldiers (maybe raid any hatchlings or larvae), as well as to be a little scouting module to survey land details. It has a wonderful minifig, and it is rather functional for a little polybag set. <br></p>
<h4>Pros<br></h4>
<ul><li>The fact that the mech is capable of being turned around is a nice little feature that makes this mech functional. <br></li><li>This set also has a very nice look to it; the mech is simple, spider-like, the color scheme is very nice, and it looks (shall I say it?) ""cute"". This set is pretty packed for its size, however. <br></li><li>This set also has a very nice minifigure in Jack Fireblade; he looks great, with his orange sleeves and silver armor, and his leg detail is superb. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The clear piece on the bottom serves absolutely no purpose; it's just their, and it brings down the look of the set considerable. <br></li><li>The mech is rather small for a $4 polybag; a bit more to it would have been nice. I know I got it for free, but I'd still like a bit more to my set. <br></li><li>One of my main complaints of Galaxy Squad is that the soldiers are all the same for every color; therefore, I have the same person in my new Mini Mech as I do in all my other Orange Team sets. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is a nice little free gift. It's small, compact, but still feels very full and complete. It's free with $50 purchases on LegoShop.com, so get it if you have the chance to. It looks very nice against the CLS-89 Eradicator Mech. I hope I have enough to spare to get next month's offer of the mini VW Camper, though; that looks like a real treat...<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,3,5
"vikings","2020-04-05T23:01:33.073Z","Not too Bad","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Comes in polybag with a little smaller than usual instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice pieces in this set. The orange pieces are nice as well as getting the trans orange bulbs. The trans yellow cones are nice as well. The total piece count for this set is 28.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get an Orange Galaxy Squad Soldier in this polybag. This is a nice minifigure for a polybag. The printing of armor on the front and back of the torso is nice as well as on the front of the legs. He has a doubled sided face on with an oxygen mask on and another without it on. I do wish they gave him a weapon of some sort, but oh well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is quick and easy. It took me a couple of minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice polybag. You get a nice figure and the mech is nice. I do wish they did a little something else with the mech. It seems just a little small even for a polybag. Besides that it is a really nice set. The mech rotates 360 degrees and legs make it sturdy (with or without the clear 2x2 round brick underneath it). Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
