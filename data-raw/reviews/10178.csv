<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice model with a lot of action for it's small piece count.</li><li>Minifigures and Insectoids to flush out your armies with.</li><li>Five extra pieces.</li></ul>

"TheFadedTBCap","2013-12-31T12:38:08.573Z","Nice Addition to the Galaxy Squad Theme","This is a nice polybag and is a great addition to Galaxy Squad theme. &nbsp;The bug has some nice details like beaming red eyes, four black legs, and dark green fangs. &nbsp;The stinger on the back bends up and down and the wings made a 1 x 4 transparent green plates rotate slightly back and forth. &nbsp;The build was simple (it is only a 27 piece set), but did include some sideways building and jumper brick. &nbsp;The parts in this set aren't bad, having some sideways building elements, some green and black fangs/claws, and two transparent green plates. &nbsp;The minifigure (Chuck Stonebreaker) is great, following in the footsteps of all the minifigures in this theme. &nbsp;His green legs detailed with knee padding which continues up to his double-sided torso decorated with space armor printing and a black belt, which all looks amazing. &nbsp;His double-sided head has a bearded face with scars and a confident smile on one side and a breathing device on the other and is cover with a green space helmet with a clear visor. Chuck Stonebreaker comes with a space gun to defend himself from this alien threat.<div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>Great minifigure</div><div>Cool alien bug</div><div>Comes with some nice parts (including lots of extra pieces)</div><div>Includes space gun</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>None</div><div><br></div><div>This a solid small set. &nbsp;Since it includes both a hero and an enemy, this set offers great playability that can grow with the addition of more Galaxy Squad sets. &nbsp;I recommend this set to the Galaxy Squad fan or someone looking for some good parts and can get this set cheaply. &nbsp;Overall, I give it a 9/10.</div>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2013-07-02T09:35:26.257Z","Insectoids of Outer Space","<p>Set #30231 Space Insectoid: Polybags are all up to interpretation at times for collectors, what makes one good or bad, and which levels of interest the Theme has for them. That being said, not all Polybags are created equal.</p>
<p>The Space Insectoid is a weaker offering from LEGO's Polybags this year, the Galaxy Squad polybags aren't bad honestly, they fit into the Theme quite nicely and offer up some cheap alternatives to the named character Mini-Figures if that's all you're interested in. Unfortunately the models leave much to be desired when it comes to the piece counts.</p>
<p>The model in this Polybag is a Galaxy Squad version of a common house fly, made with dark maroon, black, gray, transparent green, lime green and dark green parts. There is also what I would call a dark beige toned 1x2 tile on the bottom. All of the parts aren't really unique, some of the colors are, but the pieces themselves are all fairly common. It's a nice little model, but it doesn't offer up much for parts or alternative builds.</p>
<p>Chuck Stonebreaker is the Mini-Figure in this set, the Galaxy Squad Mini-Figures are all really well detailed with a lot of great color choices. Chuck is a member of the green team, found in the medium to expensive price ranges for the boxed sets. He has a double sided print on his torso for his space suit with some great muscle/armor detailing, a belt the Green Squad's logo and what I'm guessing is rank insignia. He has printing on the upper portion of his legs, knee pads and such, and a dual sided head. One with a breathing apparatus, the other with a knowing smile showing off the teeth&nbsp;and beard.</p>
<p>Accessory wise he comes with the now standard Alien Conquest weapon in medium stone gray and the matching helmet in green. Overall I'd have to say this Polybag is almost in the perfect range, but that piece count and the overall lack of usefulness for the parts in the model to make other things brings down the rating some. I still reccomend this, in fact buying multiples might make for a better deal if you can, especially on sale, as is it's an ok set that could have used a little bit more to it for the play factor for younger kids. Perhaps if it had included enough parts to build two of the same model, or a small weapon of some type that could be used to better defend Chuck from the air. Who knows.</p>
<p>It's still ok, just not wow go out and grab it immediately, it's more of a compliment for the larger Galaxy Squad sets.</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,2,3
