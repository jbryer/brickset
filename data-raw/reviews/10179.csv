"Odeinoichus","2013-02-08T15:56:19.373Z","Waiting Tables at a Bistro","<p>Set #71000 Waiter: This is one of the hardest to find from Series 9, there are only 2 in each case and I had to search through quite a large number of them just to find it. Still I'm glad I managed it, but LEGO should have really had more Waiters in the cases instead of more Mr. Good and Evils, personally.</p>
<p>The waiter doesn't have much in the way of unique prints, LEGO City and Town have had waiters before, this is a more modern interpretation of the character. The torso printing is the only printing besides his facial print of course, and it's single-sided. He's got a nice looking white undershirt with black jacket, black tie and black cumberbund.</p>
<p>Accessories include the new bottle piece in a nice transparent green colour, with a logo printed on the front with grapes, definitely a nice piece you'll want to have more of. (Perhaps LEGO will include this print and piece in other sets in the future.) He also has a new tray, a wide oval tray that he can use to bring the wine. His facial print has a nice pencil thin mustache and a sort of put-upon expression. The Computer Programmer's hair is being re-used here, in the exact same black colour, which is a bit unfortunate. Not too bad though.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this Mini-Figure is one of the better offerings from series 9 and quite sought after from the Collectible Mini-Figures series. Definitely recommend taking the time to track him down, via Bricklink, the feel method or other online sources if necessary.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

"sideswinger","2021-08-16T02:15:50.45Z","OKAY accessories, but a BORING figure!","<p>The first minifigure included in the LEGO Minifigures Series 9 is the Waiter. He includes 7 pieces, retailed for three dollars, and was released back in 2013. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that smooth black hair piece, which has a few ridges moulded in to give it a bit more detail. I do like that hair, and it fits the figure to&nbsp;me, for some reason. It wasn&#39;t anything new or exclusive, but it was a nice inclusion.</p>

<p>Next we have his head, which has a pretty good expression printed onto it. I like that thin moustache printing, and I think the confused eye-brows add a lot to the character. No alternate expression, which is expected from a 2012 CMF.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which has some good printing, although it isn&#39;t anything super amazing. I like that jacket, as well as the fancy vest; and he even has a cute little bow-tie! No back torso detail unfortunately, but the white gloves make for nice touches.</p>

<p>And since his legs are plain black with no printing whatsoever, we will move on to his accessories. Funny enough, they aren&#39;t even shown off in the official image here at Brickset, so you&#39;ll have to take my word for it. Both accessories were actually new moulds for the figure, if I&#39;m not mistaken. The first one is a gray, oval tray, that has an anti-stud on the bottom which can be plugged onto his hand. What stinks, is that the top is smooth, with a rim around it. There isn&#39;t a stud on top or anything, so his other accessory, which is a bottle, falls off very easily, and it stinks whilst displaying him. But speaking of which, his second accessory is a bottle, which once again, was new for the figure. It is caste in a translucent green colouring, and it has a grape printed on front. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s intended to be a wine bottle, or if it&#39;s just grape juice, but either way, it&#39;s a great print.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, even though he does have two great, new accessories, the figure itself is kind of bland for me. There isn&#39;t anything on the figure itself that really stands out to me at all. Again, the accessories are good, but that&#39;s all I like about the figure. And while I don&#39;t think he&#39;s the worst, he&#39;s probably my second least favourite of the entire series. So in the end, I&#39;m gonna give him a 2. That is it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
