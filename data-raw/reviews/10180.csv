"Odeinoichus","2013-02-08T15:01:56.133Z","Galactic Patrol meets Alien Avenger","<p>Set #71000 Alien Avenger: I missed the Galaxy Patrol from Series 7 so this is my first introduction to the new helmet and armor piece he used, this is a great re-use of those parts offering up a new villain for the Galaxy Patrol to fight and a new type of alien for the ever expanding LEGO Space Theme Alien Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure has a single-sided torso print, with leg printing and a nice looking facial print that is also single-sided, unfortunately. He's got a lot of great details in his printing, with different gadgets and sections of the armor visible, a pouch on his leg for holding stuff and strangely enough what appears to be the name Shami printed on his right breast. So is that his name or the name of his race I wonder?</p>
<p>The helmet's a nice looking piece for MOCing or just for whatever you'd like and the new shoulder piece is just huge, with a stud on the front and back that you can attach things to, there's also shoulder armor with printing on it. And again flight engines on the back. He carries a black double-pistol like the Galaxy Patrol does, personally I think they should have at least given him that new gun in a different colour scheme.</p>
<p>The facial print is pretty cool and it looks kind of shaggy or furry, like he's a green furred Wookie or something. Overall I recommend this Mini-Figure as one you're going to want and one that LEGO was smart enough to make him readily available for building an army of them. Yep, the Alien Avenger is a pretty good Mini-Figure to buy multiples of.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4

"sideswinger","2022-03-04T22:44:06.217Z","BORING...","<p>The eleventh figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 9 is the Alien Avenger. This figure retailed for three dollars back when it was released in 2013. He includes 7 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So on top is that space helmet, and while the piece itself isn&#39;t new, I think getting it in that dark grey colour might&#39;ve been new for the figure; I&#39;m not positive about that, though. I think it&#39;s a fitting helmet; it just doesn&#39;t personally interest me. One pet peeve I have about this figure is its boring colour scheme.</p>

<p>The next thing to discuss on this minifigure is its head, which right off the bat, it sports a sickly green tone.&nbsp;I do really like how LEGO strayed from their normal yellow tone with this character, and I think using green was a good choice for its flesh. Though it might be hard to see, that head piece features a lot of detail underneath that helmet, including some red eyes, a furry brow,&nbsp;a dark green beard, and even some ferocious-looking teeth. I love whenever LEGO adds unnecessary details to make CMF&#39;s more worth the price!</p>

<p>The next thing to discuss is that shoulder pad piece, which I suppose is a good inclusion. I like getting it in that dark grey tone, and the stud on the front adds a little bit of greebling to it. I really appreciate the bronze-coloured printing on his shoulder pads, but this piece still suffers from a bad colour scheme.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which can&#39;t really be seen with that breastplate on. However, if you take that off, you get some pretty great torso detailing, like the bronze armouring on the stomach, and the grey plating on the chest. I also really love how this figures arms are caste in that same green colour. Another&nbsp;thing I like about the torso is that it has some silver printing to break up that dead grey spread throughout the figure. He doesn&#39;t have any back torso printing, though, which is to be expected since it&#39;d be covered by the breastplate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up, we have his legs, which have some pretty great printing. I really do love that bronze knee armouring, and the silver on the top of his leg is a nice little detail. This minifigure has no side leg printing, but that is to be expected.</p>

<p>The last thing to talk about is his black gun, which is a very boring accessory overall. It&#39;s kind of a lazy choice if you ask me, since that is a very common piece in LEGO. The least they could have done was given us two guns instead of one. Oh well!</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! I wanna start my final verdict by establishing something: Series 9 is in my top 5 favourite LEGO Minifigure Series&#39; ever. Almost every minifigure is fantastic in some way or other... but I did say almost. There&#39;s three minifigures in this series I&#39;m not ecstatic about, those being the Roller Derby Girl, Mr. Good and Evil, and, unfortunately, this Alien Avenger. This figure goes well with the Series 9 Battle Mech, but that&#39;s really the only appeal this figure has. For starters, the colour scheme of this figure is just so uninteresting and unpleasant to look at, which I think really hurts the quality of this guy. Second, he has some pretty boring pieces, like the helmet, and that horrible accessory. And third, I can think of so many better alien minifigures in the past and future of the CMF line, that this one just doesn&#39;t stand out whatsoever. Overall, I feel like this character really weighs down the quality of the series. On the bright side, it isn&#39;t my least favourite in the series, so I&#39;m gonna be very generous and give this character a 3 out of 5.</p>

<p>That is all for this review! I hope you enjoyed, and thanks for reading!</p>
