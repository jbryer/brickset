<p>Like the Butcher before him the Plumber is a nice unique looking Mini-Figure based on a profession that hasn't been seen before in LEGO form. He's wearing traditional overalls, with a double-sided torso print found on many other Mini-Figures. His legs have minor printing with pockets just underneath the belt printed on his waist. His facial print, as noted, is kind of generic looking, however he has some great accessories.</p>
<p>The headpiece is a brand new style of hat/cap, I don't think I've ever seen it prior to this, and of course he comes with a brand new piece with a hard plastic handle and a soft, rubbery piece for the plunger itself. Yep he comes with a plunger, see that's why I said you're going to want this, many Modular homes with washrooms are going to need this part in them, and if you wanted you could MOC up a Plumber's Shop and Truck to go with him. Definitely recommended, and I hope LEGO will re-use the hat in red and green so we can... Well you know. Let's-A-Go!</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4

This figure was released on January 1st, 2013, where he retailed for $2.99. He includes 6 pieces. With that, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So the first thing to talk about with this figure is his epic cap piece, which was a brand new piece designed exclusively for this figure. I adore that piece, with how smooth it is on the front and top. I can&#39;t believe LEGO went the extra mile to make a new piece for this figure, when it wasn&#39;t even necessary!</p>

<p>Next is his head, and honestly, I dig his expression. It&#39;s just a simple little smirk, but that&#39;s all this figure really needs! I like the decent stubble around his mouth, and personally, I love getting generic expressions with CMF&#39;s, as it ups the customization of that piece.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which has a heck-of-a-lot of detailing that you wouldn&#39;t expect from a 2013 figure. The blue overalls are expertly printed on that white torso, and the silver zippers and buckles are nice little additions. Blue overalls are highly useful, so getting them with this character is fantastic. Another feature is that this figure has back torso printing, which was a bit of a rarity back then.</p>

<p>Finishing off the base of the figure, we have his legs, which exhibit even more excellent detail that wasn&#39;t even that necessary. I absolutely dig the printed pockets, as well as that belt design.</p>

<p>Finally, the last thing to talk about is that plunger piece, which was another part designed exclusively for this minifigure. That piece is dual-moulded, and while the brown pole is made out of hard plastic, the suction part is made from a soft red rubber, which is accurate to a real plunger. I think that accessory is one of my favourite CMF pieces ever, and it&#39;s such an awesome piece to get.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, Series 9 is one of my favourite CMF series&#39; of all time, and that&#39;s partly because this figure exists. Not only is it a fantastic concept, it&#39;s executed masterfully, especially with the use of two exclusively-designed pieces. The printing on the torso and legs is great, and this is, in the end, one of my favourites of the series!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this short review. Thanks for reading!</p>
