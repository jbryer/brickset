"Odeinoichus","2013-02-07T20:02:49.003Z","I came, I saw, I conquered","<p>Set #71000 Roman Emperor: A quick review for the sake of keeping this short, I'll be discussing things for Series 9 at length, so let's go on with the Mini-Figure.</p>
<p>The Roman Emperor is a nice companion piece to the Roman Legionaire, Egyptian Queen and Gladiator from past Series, all we need now is a Centurion or Marcus Aurelius in a future Mini-Figure Series to complete the ensemble cast of Cleopatra. The print on the Roman Emperor is all one-sided, in a rich mahogany colour we see the robes of the Emperor, complete with gold trim detailing, his legs also have minor foot printing to indicate the sandals worn by the character of Julius Ceasar. (He's pretty much just got two single lines printed across his foot, they are relatively thin also.)</p>
<p>The face has age lines to indicate wisdom, the hairpiece has a molded on laurel, already I foresee this hairpiece being re-used for Puck from A Midsummers' Night Dream, or perhaps Lord Oberon himself, as certain interpretations have included the laurel. He includes a square 2x2 plate with the printed words Veni, Vidi, Vici and a bunch of illegible script on a scroll design.</p>
<p>Overall I think this Mini-Figure is pretty great, his torso, legs and hairpiece could be re-used for Roman Senators or other figures for MOCing, the facial print is nice too for potential re-use, however the Emperor is a bit of a weaker Mini-Figure if you've missed the chance to get previous Roman inspired Mini-Figures. (Like me.) His legs are also a little bit screwy, in that the back of them does not carry over the printed detailing of the lower toga, making him look as though he's... Well suffering a draft to put it politely. A decent Mini-Figure for parts, with a unique print that can be useful for MOCs, still one of the weaker offerings and mildly recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3

I hardly know 'er!","Is there a reason why TLC continues to tease us with hints of Rome without ever actually coming out with a full-fledged Roman theme? First we get the beautiful Greco-Roman ruins featured in City of Atlantis (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7985-1"">7985</a>), and subsequently we get not one but <a href=""http://brickset.com/search/?query=roman"">THREE</a> Collectible Minifigs to populate a Roman world that doesn't officially exist! Oh, how we suffer in anticipation of things that are never to come.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Anyway, back to Roman Emperor. I'm a historical Minifig nut, make no mistake about that, and it's nice to see a leader-type person depicted in Minifig form as opposed to a belligerent, which is much more common in the ""peaceful"" LEGO universe. There's plenty to like about our dear LEGO Caesar - torso and legs printed with the rare and attractive dark red colour, a printed tile recounting Julius Caesar's famous words, a unique ""aged"" head that's quite uncommon, I think, among the generally youthful LEGO population, and a new hairpiece with lots of MOC potential.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Yeah, I definitely like this guy a lot, though I have to ask: why straight dark red instead of a white/purple combination? I guess I can see that dark red lends itself to thematic coherence with the other Roman Minifigs, but somehow it might have been nice to see the emperor clad in royal purple. Maybe this can be considered when we actually get a Roman theme (yeah right).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Since this guy is ostensibly the man in charge, there's fortunately no need to seek out hundreds of them to build an army. One emperor at the head your legion ought to be good enough. For that reason, seek out and conquer your nearest LEGO retailer and see if you can't own one of these for yourself - feeling around for the tile might make it easy, maybe?&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,1,4,1
"sideswinger","2022-01-02T03:40:17.97Z","great HAIR, but...","<p>The fifth minifigure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 9 is the Roman Emperor. This retailed for $2.99 back in the day, it includes 6 pieces, and it was released way back in 2013. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair piece that was introduced with this minifigure. I really love the moulded details etched into the back, and it features an incredible gold ornament decorating his head, which is created using printing rather than dual-moulding.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which has a print that was and still is exclusive to the figure. I really love the wrinkles printed on his head, and the angry expression is pretty useful outside of this setting. Of course, he doesn&#39;t have an alternate look, but that comes to be expected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving on, we have his torso, which sports some great Roman apparel. That red toga&nbsp;looks fantastic, as does the gold lining surrounding that printed flap. Unfortunately, he does not include any back torso printing. Rather, it&#39;s just that plain dark red colour that the torso is caste in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next is the legs, and they may appear to be dual-moulded, but they are actually, in fact, printed. The dark red tone is printed to line up perfectly with the torso, and the golden trim adds a good touch. Of course, another great detail is the thin shoes printed on the very bottom of his feet.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessory, which happens to be a 2x2 tile that features the text, &quot;VENI, VIDI, VICI&quot; on it. Thanks to my mother, I can confirm that it translates to &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered,&quot; which is a great little detail integrated into the figure. That is the only accessory included, though.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, this minifigure is okay. Just simply, okay. He&#39;s definitely not bad whatsoever, but he isn&#39;t necessarily fantastic either.&nbsp;Here&#39;s the thing: when it boils down to it, the hair piece is really the only great part of the figure. The rest is just average. But with that being said, I find myself liking this figure more than some of the other generic historical CMF&#39;s. So at the end of the day, I am gonna give this minifigure a 3&nbsp;out of 5. That&#39;s all for this review. Thank you for reading!</p>
