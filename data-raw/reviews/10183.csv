"tkettle9719","2013-01-19T12:51:36.657Z","Galaxy Patrol Unit 13 To the Rescue","<p>I got this set in my most recent purchase from shop.lego.com, and I must say that I'm very impressed by this minifig. He is very detailed from a frontal view, and the six pieces that come with him are very excellent and unique (except for the stand, of course). He feels like he could fit in well with the new Galaxy Squad sets (which I like for the human vehicles; the robot sidekicks are really cool also). <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>I love the jetpack for this guy; it's simple and one piece big, but it's very realistic and accurate to my vision for a jetpack. <br></li><li>I also love the helmet; with the head, it looks very robotic and looks ready for action. It almost reminds me of a Power Ranger helmet. <br></li><li>The detail (in the front) is awesome; the legs especially are very nice and add life to the character of this fig. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>My one major problem with this minifig is that it doesn't have a weapon; at least a small gun would have made this set almost perfect. <br></li><li>I also am not a fan of the anti-backside printing; this would have made the figure come to life even more, a small amount of POP!<br></li><li>I also think that maybe the detail in the front is unnecessary due to the fact that it is almost fully covered up by the armor piece. <br></li></ul>
<p>This minifig is an excellent way to add a larger population to your Space army; it would almost certainly act as another sidekick in the Galaxy Squad sets. It's colors are nice, but it does lack a weapon, which sort of makes this a bit worse. If you have the chance, get this fig, but make sure it has some sort of weapon to make it that much more imposing. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-02-08T14:21:51.547Z","Go Battle Mech Super God of War Defender of Truth and Justice!","<p>Set #71000 Battle Mech: What a unique Mini-Figure choice, taken straight out of old school Japanese Anime and the like this Battle Mech Mini-Figure could make an excellent addition to your Exo-Force Mini-Figure collection. Or be used alongside Classic and Modern era Space Sets to maximum effect.</p>
<p>The Battle Mech has a great looking print on his torso, orange bits of armour with gray, white and black mixed in, and the legs add even more to the effect of the Print with some type of upper leg armour. The facial print is a visored robotic face, on a white head, something you don't see too often. Then there's the new Chest Piece and Helmet, both of which have orange paint with silver detail work added in, the v-crest on the helmet and the grille design on the chest are really fun looking.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the new chest armor piece has two 'Engines' sticking out of the back, possibly for flying, however these two pieces are designed so you can clip items onto the armor. There is a lot of great potential here for some MOCing. Overall though you might find him a little dissapointing, considering he has no hand-held accessories of any kind this Mini-Figure might not be to everybody's tastes. That being said however, I find him one of the better offerings from the set, and strongly recommend giving him a chance. Here's hoping we see a red and black (cliched though it may be) Evil Mech in a future Series, and perhaps a new one-shot Theme that introduces accessories to attach to the back of the v-shaped chest armour.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"sideswinger","2022-03-23T19:25:12.45Z","GOOD or BAD???","<p>Hey everybody! Sideswinger here, and today we&#39;re gonna take a look at the LEGO Minifigure Series 9 Battle Mech! This figure was released all the way back in January 2013, where it retailed for an epic price of $2.99. This character includes 6 pieces. With that, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that epic helmet, which fits over the minifigure&#39;s head piece very snugly. I do, in fact, believe that the helmet was new for this figure, and the detailing on it is very nicely done. I love the orange detailing on the head-crest, and the silver mouth-guard print is a nice little addition. There are some more orange detailing on the sides of the helmet, which actually carry on to the back of that piece. Rarely ever do we see LEGO Minifigure prints with 360 degree printing, yet we se it here, on that helmet. That just shows how every detail counts, in LEGO&#39;s eyes!</p>

<p>Next is the head, which is what really makes me love this figure. It may be hard to believe, but there is actually printing on that head. The piece itself is caste in white, and the black visor at the front is printed. As if that isn&#39;t cool enough, there are all kinds of mechanical detailing around that visor, ranging from orange vents, to grey shades. There isn&#39;t any head printing at the back, but the fact LEGO went the extra mile to print the head piece at all is mind-blowing.</p>

<p>Next up is that amazing armour piece, which was yet another piece designed exclusively for this figure. I really dig that design, so I&#39;m gonna break down all the details of it with you guys. First off, the moulded work on it is extravagant, with those fantastic grills on front. I adore how the shoulders really jut out above the arms, and I like how low the whole piece hangs on his torso. Of course, there&#39;s a lot of epic printing on the armour, like the orange around the collar and chest, and the silver detailing done around the grills. There isn&#39;t any printed detail at the back, but there are two poles attached to the armour. I really love that detail, as it sort of resembles jet pack thrusters.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which, you guessed it, has even more extravagant detail. It sort of resembles an Iron Man suit, but with even better printing. There&#39;s detailing around the stomach that resembles air vents, there&#39;s a grey arc-reactor like detail printed in the centre, and there are all kinds of orange armour surrounding the chest and belly. There isn&#39;t any printed detail at the back, but considering this was made in 2013, the printed detail on this is mind-blowing.</p>

<p>The last thing to talk about is his legs, which, despite being the least interesting piece of the figure, have even more fantastic printing. As you can see, lots of grey knee-armour is printed at the front. It would have been nice to have got printing on the sides of the legs, but maybe I&#39;m asking for too much.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the figure, since no accessories are included. Overall, Series 9 is one of my favourite Series&#39; of all time, and that&#39;s partly because this figure exists. No matter how many times LEGO tries to recreate this mech with CMF spin-offs, this will always be my favourite. The level of detail added to this character is like no other CMF that ever preceded this figure, and this is a figure that would hold up in a Minifigures Series to this very day. This may be my favourite in the series, and I&#39;m obviously giving it a 5 out of 5, as it&#39;s one of my favourite CMF&#39;s ever released.</p>

<p>That is it for this review! I greatly appreciate you guys reading this. I hope you enjoyed!</p>
