<p>Her torso print shows off a corseted dress with a red shawl around her neck, the front of the 'sloped brick' shows the lower half of a Gypsy dress, truly inspired. There are swirled designs on the lower half of the dress, symbols perhaps of reading fortunes or superstitions. Her facial print has a rather strange expression on it, well not strange, but the only teeth visible in her open mouth are the upper set, so either she's lost her lower set of teeth or they're hidden somehow. Her eyes make her look worried a little, I thought the hairpiece might be a re-use from the PotC Theme, but I believe it's actually completely new. She's got dark hair with a nice purple scarf wrapped over her hair and three gold rings.</p>
<p>Her accessories are two 1x2 tiles with Tarot Card printing, one showing the Sun another showing a Tower with Lightning. Overall I think this Mini-Figure is a nice choice from LEGO, she'll fit in quite well as an ally of the Monster Fighters, or you could use her parts in numerous MOC Gypsy Caravans. I hope we'll see different types of hair colors with the new headpiece. I also wouldn't mind seeing different types of Tarot Cards being introduced so that more than two can be used by this Fortune Teller. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2022-01-23T21:54:44.243Z","one of the BEST of the SERIES???","<p>Hey everyone! Sideswinger here, and today we&#39;re going to be reviewing the ninth minifigure in the LEGO Minifigures Series 9, her being the Fortune Teller. She was released in 2013, retailed for 3 dollars, and includes 7 pieces. Now let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that hair-hat combo, which is my personal favourite part of the figure. Unfortunately, because I don&#39;t have this minifigure on-hand, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s dual-moulded or printed. If I had to guess, I&#39;d probably guess it were printed, but I don&#39;t know for sure. Either way, I love that piece so much. The moulding on the hair is intricately detailed, and the purple bandanna looks incredible. Of course in the front are those golden coins attached to the hair, which adds more detail. And of course, that whole piece was very new to the figure.</p>

<p>Next is her head piece, which features an excellent expression. That print is highly useful outside of this setting. She doesn&#39;t have an alternate expression, which is&nbsp;to be expected, though it&#39;s a bit unfortunate.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which has some very detailed printing. I like the white undershirt print, and I really love how she includes white arms, since they contrast excellently with the&nbsp;character. She doesn&#39;t include any back torso printing, though, which is a bit unfortunate.</p>

<p>And finishing off the base of the minifigure, we have that dress piece. Obviously, it&#39;s the old-style dress piece, since the new dress piece was introduced in mid-2018. I&#39;m actually very impressed by the level of detail on that dress, especially considering this was made in 2013. The detail on the dress kind of reminds me of the Mrs. Trelawney minifigure from the Harry Potter and Fantastic Beast&#39;s series. Of course, there&#39;s obviously not any back dress printing, because back dress printing wasn&#39;t introduced until 2019 or 2020, I believe.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessories. She actually includes two, both of which are 1x2 tiles with exclusive printing. I adore those prints, and I like how they resemble playing cards. One of them has a cute little castle design, and the other has a useful little sun print.</p>

<p>That is all for this minifigure! Overall, in my LEGO Minifigures Series ranking list I made here on Brickset, Series 9 made second place. This series has so many excellent minifigures, and this is one of them. I adore almost every part of this character, and it&#39;s an excellent idea as well. So that is it&nbsp;for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
