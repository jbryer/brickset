<p>Hollywood Starlet is obviously patterned after everybodies' favorite film celebrity Marilyn Monroe, younger children may not be aware of her as she hasn't been around for a good long while. However she was one of Hollywood's top leading ladies, with a highly demanding lifestyle and work load, which some believe may have contributed to her untimely death at a young age.</p>
<p>The print on this Mini-Figure is quite impressive, she's wearing a long evening gown as she accepts her Oscar (Academy Award LEGO Guy), a shame really her only accessory is the little golden statue. It may have been nice to see her also holding an envelope, or microphone maybe. The print on the evening gown is very well executed, it appears to be a sequined ball gown of sorts with a jeweled necklace around her neck. Her hairpiece is blonde and done up in Marilyn's trademark style. The face is single-sided with a print of a white toothed smile and luscious ruby red lips. (Mine could stand a bit of touch-up, the print seems to have gotten a bit mussed up, but that's probably a one time thing and it isn't too badly damaged.)</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that LEGO really did a great job with the Hollywood Starlet, another great new Female Mini-Figure for your LEGO Mini-Figure collection and even though it isn't a licensed Mini-Figure it definitely evokes the look and feel of Miss Monroe. Oh yes and the colour of the torso and 'sloped brick legs' is one not often seen on Mini-Figures, a nice light teale colour. Definitely try and get a few&nbsp;of her for the parts and colours alone.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

"sideswinger","2021-08-17T23:38:33.047Z","fantastic HAIR-PIECE, but an OKAY figure!","<p>The second figure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 9 is the Hollywood Starlet. She includes 6 pieces, and retailed for three dollars when she was released back in 2013. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that hair piece that was actually, believe it or not, new for the figure. Nowadays, it is pretty common, so not many people know it was introduced with this figure. Anyways, I love the colour it&#39;s caste in, which is that yellow-blonde tone. That colour actually isn&#39;t super common for that piece nowadays, though I don&#39;t believe it is exclusive any more. Either way, I think that hair piece is probably my favourite part of the figure.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which has a fantastic print. It looks super generic, which is good, because it can be used in more MOC figures. I like how it is loosely based off celebrities from around the 20&#39;s through 50&#39;s, and of course, it appears slightly reminiscent of the iconic Marilyn Monroe. As expected, she has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which once again, seems reminiscent of actresses from around the 20&#39;s through the 50&#39;s. I love the unconventional blue tone used here, and the intricate silver dots sprinkled throughout appears highly detailed. I love&nbsp;the yellow flesh printing on the top of the torso, but she lacks back torso detail, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Finishing off the framework of the figure itself, we have that dress, which is the old styling, since this was way&nbsp;back in 2013. The printing on the front of it looks exceptional, though, and the wrinkles on the side add a nice level of detail.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessory, which is nothing special. It&#39;s just that small, golden trophy piece that has appeared in several CMF&#39;s over the years. It is a fitting accessory, though, so I can&#39;t really complain that much.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, this is far from my favourite of the series. However, it&#39;s even farther from my least favourite, putting it right in the middle of my rankings. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the hair piece tremendously, especially since it was new for the figure. But honestly, the rest of the figure doesn&#39;t have that same level of greatness. Still, in the end, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 3 out of 5 just because of that hair piece. That basically wraps up this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
