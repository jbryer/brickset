"TheBigLegoski","2013-01-12T11:37:01.65Z","A paragon of chivalry","<p>TLG gave us Lego fans an evil knight in CMF series 7, and now we finally get the paladin in this latest CMF series 9, to pit against this rogue knight from series 7. As a huge Lego castle fan this particular minifig is/was very much desired by me, and amongst my favourites of this new batch of CMF&#39;s released this January.<br />
<br />
Upon opening the little CMF bag you will find ten parts included for this heroic champion:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a plume (white, to adorn his helmet to be placed upon the visor)</li>
	<li>a hounskull visor (light grey)</li>
	<li>the helmet (light grey)</li>
	<li>a minifig head (yellow, with smirky toothpaste smile expression, asymmetrically raised eyebrows, masculine cheekbone lines, and chin dimple)</li>
	<li>knight-armour (metallic/pearl medium dark silver, and printing)</li>
	<li>a minifig torso (light grey body, arms, and dark grey hands, no print)</li>
	<li>minifig legs (light grey legs, with dark grey hips, and printing)</li>
	<li>a black CMF posing 3X4 plate</li>
	<li>a medieval sword (metallic/pearl medium dark silver)</li>
	<li>a triangular shield (metallic/pearl medium dark silver, with print)</li>
</ul>

<p>Except for the redesigning of the the classic Lego-sword (the crossguard of the sword is modified), this CMF does not contain any new parts which did not already exist.<br />
<br />
<b>What I like about this minifig:</b><br />
I love his armour piece and shield, it has printing on it in three (3) different colours; black, white, and dark metallic grey. The print on the shield is very well executed, and even has four (4) different colours, in addition to the three (3) afore mentioned colours it is also adorned with light metallic silver. It features a coat of arms with a crown depicted very similar in design/shape to the Lego Crown knights from the Castle fantasy Era (2007-2009), and is also placed on a quartered background, this time white and dark metallic silver.<br />
The face print of this minifig is to my knowledge unique, though there are other minifig&#39;s with the same expression. (The Kingdoms Lion Prince from the advent calender ( #7952 ), and the race car driver from series 3 e.g.) this particular version is a new print.<br />
The leg print is also nice, if you get multiples of this minifig you can diversify them by exchanging legs so their armour looks less standard, after all in medieval times armour-suits weren&#39;t usually mass produced.<br />
<br />
<b>What I am disappointed about regarding this minifig:</b><br />
He does not have any printing on his torso. Most CMF&#39;s don&#39;t have any back printing. This poor dude does not even have any on his tummy. I would have loved to see this minifig with a print underneath his armour similar to the Alien Avenger, and Battle Mech from this series.<br />
The colour of his helmet is a major bummer! What is up with that!? Plain light grey! I would have liked him infinity better had TLG used the exact same colour for his helmet and visor as they have done for his armour, shield, and sword. Plus the colour of these accessories deviates from the shiny light metallic silver/grey used for all my other Castle and Kingdoms minifig&#39;s, so exchanging his helmet for another Castle knight&#39;s helmet in order to give him a proper upgrade will still leave him with a non-matching metallic/pearl silver helmet and armour.<br />
Last but not least, I love the new long broadsword, which came with the Evil Knight and is included in many other sets too, so why they included an old type of sword with a blunt tip for this CMF is beyond me.<br />
<br />
<b>My final verdict:</b><br />
As a Lego castle fan this is a wonderful minifig which is a most welcome addition to my collection, however had I been in charge of design and production for this CMF, I would have given him the new long broad sword with a pointed tip, and a matching pearl/metallic helmet and visor to go along with his armour, shield and sword</p>

"Odeinoichus","2013-02-08T15:16:51.843Z","Heroes Rise","<p>Set #71000 Heroic Knight: This is one of the more abudant and less impressive Mini-Figures offered in Series 9, yet he's still a pretty good buy.</p>
<p>The Heroic Knight has no torso printing, instead his armor has front printing, something often seen in LEGO Castle Theme sets. This is my first exposure to it as most knights with this style of printing tend to be in the more expensive sets. He's pretty much all gray, light and dark with a dull silver tone used for the sword, shield and armor. The print on the front of the armor piece is interesting, with rivets and greaves and other elements, this printing is carried down onto the upper legs showing the added protection.</p>
<p>His sword appears to be an old piece at first glance, however I think it's more of a combination design of new and old, while the old broadsword blade with the rounded edges is used the handle/hilt looks different from older Castle era swords. The shield has a nice returning Crown Knight print on it from the Fantasy Era Crown Knights, with white and silver used for the pattern/detail work. He also has one white plume for his standard Castle era helmet in light gray. In a way I think this is a bit unfortunate, I kind of miss the older Castle Dragon plumes with the wings that went on the side of this helmet type and hope those accessories return in the new Castle sets from the Summer Waves.</p>
<p>Overall I think if you're a fan of knights and Castle you're going to enjoy this Mini-Figure, his parts aren't unique or anything, but they are useful and a few of these guys together will make a nice little addition to the Fantasy Era Crown Knights faction. I like the facial print on him as well, as he does have a cheesy looking heroic smile. Recommended, though you might prefer to track down the rarer Mini-Figures from the Case Ratio first.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"Ernst","2013-02-14T17:41:29.177Z","Heroic Knight ; A Castle fan must have","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks</strong> : A nice mini figure for most, a must-have one for Castle fans and collectors. Nothing really special about this Knight&nbsp;but he is a Knight, he has a new shield and we have a new Hero for MOC&#39;s.</p>

<p><strong>Building 1 brick</strong> : One brick for assembling the mini figure.</p>

<p><strong>Parts&nbsp;3 bricks</strong> : The real&nbsp;good parts are the new shield and the body Armour. The legs fit good with the body Armour. The head has a funny look on it but two faces would have been welcome. The sword is sufficient but the new long one would have been better. The grey torso would have been better with a&nbsp;print on it, helmet, visor and plume are ok.&nbsp;Missing is a cape, this would have made him complete.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks</strong> : Give him a horse, built him a good MOC and this CMF will give enough playing fun.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks</strong> : Normally a CMF is 5 bricks for me, now 4&nbsp;because we have to buy him a cape to make him complete.</p>

"sideswinger","2021-12-30T20:10:43.547Z","criminally UNDERRATED!","<p>The fourth figure in LEGO Minifigures Series 9 is the Heroic Knight. This figure includes a total often pieces, and he retailed for three dollars when he was released back in 2013. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, is that helmet, which is made up of three pieces: the feather the helmet base, and that face-shield in front. I really love how all those parts come together, and it makes for a great helmet overall. I don&#39;t believe the visor part was new for the figure, but I may be wrong about that.</p>

<p>Next is the face which is, of course, exclusive to the figure. I do really like that cocky expression, but it reminds me a little too much of the Nexo Night, Lance, which is a bit unfortunate considering Lance is also a white night. That makes me wonder if LEGO was just slacking off. Still, it&#39;s a nice head print. He doesn&#39;t feature an alternate expression, which is to be expected.</p>

<p>I suppose the next part&nbsp;to discuss would be that breastplate. The mould itself was not new to the figure, but the printing on it is, indeed, exclusive. I really do love the design it has, with all the silver plates and chains. I also really appreciate the different&nbsp;shades of grey mingled throughout it. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t any printing on the back.</p>

<p>The next thing to talk about would technically be his torso, but since it doesn&#39;t feature any printing&nbsp;whatsoever, we&#39;re gonna move on to the legs. Side note: it&#39;s cool getting that colour&nbsp;torso with no printing. Anyway, the legs feature some extravagant printing, with shiny, silver knee armour. He does not include any side-leg printing.</p>

<p>Finally, we have his accessories, two of which are included. First off, a sword and shield is so necessary for a figure like this, so the inclusion of those accessories is fantastic. I really like how cartoony the grey sword is, with the rounded tip, and even the round hilt; and the shield has some surprisingly advanced printing. I really appreciate the checkered background design, and the different shades of grey is fantastic.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, I think this figure is criminally underrated. I&#39;ve heard this figure get some undeserved hate from various reviewers, and I think the hate he gets is totally unnecessary! Sure, he isn&#39;t the most complex LEGO knight, but that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s bad. He&#39;s just a classic, typical, normal knight, which is a trope I wish was in an earlier series of CMF&#39;s. So in the end, I&#39;m going to give this character a 4 out of 5! That&#39;s all for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
