"Odeinoichus","2013-02-07T20:18:41.59Z","Dr. Jyckled","<p>Set #71000 Mr. Good and Evil: We've had Dracula, a Witch, Werewolf, Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster and even a Vampire Bat-Man or Man-Bat, now LEGO introduces another classic Horror film icon. In a way, all that's left is to see an Invisible Man and Hunchbacked Mini-Figure to truly represent the classics.</p>
<p>Mr. Good and Evil is quite a mouthful, and he doesn't accurately represent the character he is meant to, in that Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde were two personalities and the potion changed Jeckyl into Hyde, we never saw anything like the print LEGO has given us for him. Still the printing on this character is highly impressive and the Mini-Figure looks great. If anything he almost looks like a man slowly turning into a Zombie.</p>
<p>The printing is that of an old-style English Gentleman's suit, one side is pristine and unmarred, complete with the chain of a pocket watch in his pocket. The other side is tattered and torn, showing off the green skin underneath (representing Evil or Hyde I guess.) and his legs have a printed belt on the waist with some more tatters on one side showing green skin again. (The belt is also tattered on one side and worn, truly beautiful attention to detail.)</p>
<p>His face is dual printed, similar to Two-Face from Batman and DC Super Heroes, one side is an ordinary yellow skinned Mini-Figure with a large bushy side-burn, the other has some painted green and the ugly face of Mr. Hyde. His hat has some printing showing holes and scuff marks, he's carrying the flask that is meant to represent the potion which transforms him. The flask we've seen before with other Mini-Figures and other sets.</p>
<p>Overall I think this Mini-Figure is pretty nifty, but it isn't completely without issues. The green skin on the left-hand side should have really been all the way around instead of stopping to show the yellow once again, unless they'd planned on making it a double-sided head, or given him a different head to make him one or the other, the unfinished green skin only being on the front of the face looks odd. More like scar tissue than showing him with two distinct skin tones. Also, I think the left arm should have had minor printing, perhaps just a tattered hole in it to show some green, or something, might have completed the look of the figure a bit better. Still what is there for printing is just so detailed and full of rich design work, it can't be easy to make as something as small as a Mini-Figure torso look like two seperate costumes. I recommend picking this one up if you can, he'd look great with the past monsters and Monster Fighters sets.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

"8BrickMario","2015-10-09T18:10:56.34Z","Unlike this poor fellow, I'm not split on my opinion!","<p>Mr. Good and Evil struck me as a very creative and interesting concept, so I made him a priority from Series 9. Was I right to get him, or should I have listened to my bad side?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for Series 9 is pretty dull, in an uninspiring gray color. Not my favorite. The checklist looks nice, though. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this figure aren&#39;t very useful besides his hat and potion, but they look great. I really like the flask with purple liquid.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He&#39;s very cool! Based on&nbsp;<em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</em>, this figure is both in one! I imagine it&#39;s harder to live in a Two-Face style than to have one consciousness take over, but it&#39;s a very clever way to include both. His hat is the same old top hat, but it has a few scuffs and a tear on it. I like to position the hat so the damage is on the &quot;Mr. Evil&quot; side. His face is terrific, on one side depicting a worried Victorian gentleman with sideburns (&quot;Mr. Good&quot;), and on the other side, a monstrous green man with an evil grimace and a sunken green eye. His torso is done in much the same way, with his left hand being green and the left side of the coat and shirt being torn and damaged. Even the buttons are&nbsp;crooked toward the left! I really wish they had printed the left arm with a rip in the sleeve, though. The pants continue the pattern, with the belt becoming shabby past the buckle and some more rips in the pant legs. He carries the potion of purple liquid that started the transformation.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s fantastic! He&#39;s a clever execution of (a) classic character(s), and he works well in a Victorian or Halloween setting. I&#39;d recommend him!</p>

"ThoughtLash","2015-10-05T17:11:59.45Z","Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde","<p>A take on the classic story <em>Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.</em></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Jekyll/Hyde came is the standard CM plastic bag, with a small sheet with a checklist on one side&nbsp;and instructions on the other.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This minifigure is very interesting.&nbsp; Half of his body is printed with a nice, clean suit while the other is torn and ragged.&nbsp; One hand is yellow and the other is sand green, to match the left half of his face.&nbsp; His hat has scratches on it, and his pants have tears on one side.&nbsp; A flask with purple fluid is included as his accesory.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Mr. Good and Evil is a very good depiction of Dr. Jekyll transforming into Mr. Hyde.&nbsp; The good half looks worried, while the evil half is suitably malicious.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Over in a flash.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Nice minifig, which I recommend to classic monster movie fans.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-03-23T19:47:28.24Z","more EVIL than GOOD!!!","<p>The fourteenth minfigure included in LEGO Minifigures Series 9 is Mr. Good and Evil. This character was released way back in 2013, where he cashed in at $2.99. This character includes 6 pieces. Is this figure good, or is he evil? Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>So on top of the figure, we have that top hat, and while the piece itself was not new for the figure, getting it with the scuffed up detailing made it exclusive to this character. There is a bit of detail printed at the sides, but there&#39;s no detailing whatsoever at the back of the hat.</p>

<p>Next is the face, which looks good, at the front. I like how Mr. Good has a frown, and some black sideburns. I also like how expressive that eyebrow is. However, my biggest issue with this character comes with Mr. Evil. I wanna star my complaint by gushing about the expression, which looks evil indeed. I really love the black hair at the sides, I love the green eye, and I love the green tint to the face. But when you turn the figure to the side, things really start to fall apart. See, Mr. Evil is only printed at the front, meaning the side, and the back are just plain yellow. There really was no way around that back in 2013, but I think LEGO would&#39;ve been better off not making this figure at all, since that problem is so significant. I mean he&#39;s called Mr. Good and Evil, not Mr. Good and one-half Mr. Evil. The point of this character is that he has a split personality, and if LEGO can&#39;t capture that key aspect, they should&#39;ve left this character alone, and came back to it in a few years.</p>

<p>Moving on from that small rage, we have his torso, and thankfully, it doesn&#39;t have as many issues. I love how one side of it is very upkept and professional, while the other side is ripped, and torn. The vest underneath has some great detail, and I like how one of his hands is green. It would have been great if we got back printing, but no back detailing is included whatsoever.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which do have a bit of printing on the Mr. Evil half of the character. I like how his pants appear torn, and how some green flesh is showing through.</p>

<p>The last thing to talk about is his accessory, which is just a simple scientific flask. I do like the purple colour inside the bottle, but, despite it being very fitting, there isn&#39;t too much to talk about with that piece.</p>

<p>That is it for this mnifigure! Overall, Series 9 is one of my favourite series&#39; of all time. However, there are three figures in this series I don&#39;t like, those being Roller Derby Girl, Alien Avenger, and sadly, Mr. Good and Evil. I actually adore the concept behind this figure, being as it is based off the notorious Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But, despite that, the figure severely lacks printing on the side of the head, and it just falls short as whole in comparison to the rest of the series. This character feels like something from Series 4, and I really expect more from Series 9. I am gonna give this character a 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>That is it for this review! Thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed!</p>
