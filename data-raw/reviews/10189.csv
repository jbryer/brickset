"tisi","2013-01-31T14:57:47.643Z","That's how a Lego policeman should look like!","<p>When I read the first news about this figure, I thought: 'Blah, another policeman. It doesn't make sense.' But now I know how does it look like, and I like it! I made a Pros/Cons list (well, there's no point of writing an Eurobricks.style review about such a small set).<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The clothing is very nice. The dark blue works perfect as a main colour (it gives a little USA-feeling I think). <br></li><li>The detailed torso with belt, pen and badge is just great!<br></li><li>The cap with the badge is also cool.</li><li>The small black gadget with the identity card is awesome.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The handcuffs - they are very common in other police sets. TLG could give something other accessory (for example a baton).<br></li><li>It's just a small 'con': the badge on the cap is golden, while the one on the torso and on the black gadget is silver.<br></li><li>The price - collectable minifigures are a bit pricey.</li></ul>
<p>In conclusion, I think it is one of the best minifigs of Series 9. If you collect City/Town sets, get some of them for your local police station!</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English grammar! :D<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2013-02-07T20:55:10.24Z","TACKLEBERRY!","<p>Set #71000 Policeman: A lot of collectors might think this is a wasted slot, with wasted potential for something more unique, I mean how many Policemen have we seen from LEGO through the years in their City and Town Themes? The thing is, all of them are pretty generic, while this one shares that trait it offers us a brand new, and much demanded (By many Adult fans) piece. A proper looking Police Hat mold. He's also dressed in Dress Blues, most police officers in LEGO City tend to wear black instead of blue.</p>
<p>Not much in the way of printing, we have a single-sided torso print of the Policeman's uniform, with black tie, pockets, a pen and notepad and a badge pinned to his chest/uniform. As well as a belt with pockets above the waistline, the hat mold is great, with the black trim, the shield embossed on the front in gold and all the corners you'd see on Beat Cops head gear. (Not plainclothes detectives or such.) His face print is also a bit generic, with a happy smile and some lines to show off his cheekbones (or something).</p>
<p>He includes two accessories, standard LEGO Handcuffs and a 1x2 tile with his badge number and ID printed on it. Overall I really strongly recommend picking up multiples of this one, I'm aiming to grab a few more beside the two I already got, you see these Mini-Figures are great for making some pretty impressive Dioramas. I personally wouldn't mind trying to MOC up a decent Police Academy scene one of these days, as one of my favorite classic spoof comedies I'd love to see a Cuusoo project or something incorporate the new Police hat for some swell scenes. A simple Mini-Figure, but very well recieved on my part. Your interest might vary though.</p>",TRUE,5,4,1,5,5

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The hat: Pointed sides, new design, nice color.</li><li>Printing: He looks like a cop!</li><li>The face: What a policeman's face should look like.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Price anybody? A dollar overboard.</li><li>Con 2</li><li>â€¦</li></ul><p>A great addition to any Lego collection.&nbsp;This is the Series 9 one to get!</p>",TRUE,5,4,1,5,4
"sideswinger","2022-01-02T04:21:50.883Z","BEST LEGO policeman EVER?","<p>The sixth LEGO Minifigure in LEGO Minifigures Series 9 is the Policeman. This minifigure retailed for 3 bucks, includes 7 pieces, and was released way back in 2013. Let&#39;s take a closer look at this guy!</p>

<p>Starting off the minifigure, we have that Police hat, which is perhaps the most interesting piece of the entire figure. Nowadays, it doesn&#39;t look like much, but back in 2013, it was new for the figure. Personally, I adore that piece, and I think I always will. The detail on it is really extraordinary! I love how it&#39;s black on bottom, and how the black part has that visor section. Above that, it morphs into a dark blue tone that surrounds the whole upper section. I love how flat the hat is on top, and how pointy it is around the edges. Another great detail on it is that golden yellow badge. Plus, it&#39;s wild to think that piece was introduced in this character.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which isn&#39;t very special or interesting. However, it is technically&nbsp;exclusive. I actually do like just how simple and generic it is, as that increases the usefulness outside the setting. I like the printed cheekbones as well. He does not have an alternative expression, which is good considering it&#39;d be severely exposed at the back.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, and I personally think that the torso on this minifigure is my favourite LEGO policeman torso print in the entirety of LEGO System. It&#39;s just such a classic, typical LEGO police torso! I wanna talk about all the interesting prints on it, such as that black tie, the dark blue pockets, and even that intricate black belt. Another thing to note is that golden police badge on his chest. He does not include any back torso printing, which is unfortunate, but expected.</p>

<p>And since he has no printing on his legs, we will move on to his accessory. Side note: it&#39;s nice to get those colour legs without printing. Anyway, that handcuff piece was not new for the figure, but it makes for a fantastic and fitting accessory for the character. I can&#39;t even think of a more fitting piece! But that isn&#39;t all! This figure also includes a police ID piece, which is printed on a 1x2 tile. I really adore that print! It&#39;s extremely useful outside the setting, yet it remains extremely fitting for the character.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, I have a lot to say in this final verdict, so stay here. First off, I wanna say that this is more than likely not the most detailed LEGO Police minifigure in the world of LEGO. But, I must say, it&#39;s probably my personal favourite LEGO Policeman ever. It&#39;s such a typical LEGO police figure that it captures the aesthetic better than any&nbsp;LEGO Police I&#39;ve seen. Plus, the&nbsp;new hat for the figure makes it a lot better. So, overall, this is such a perfect representation of the concept that it&#39;s one of my favourite figures in the entire series. At the end of the day, I&#39;m gonna give this a pretty solid 5 out of 5! That is it for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
