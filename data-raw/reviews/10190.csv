"Odeinoichus","2013-02-08T17:48:37.93Z","Under the Sea Again","<p>Set #71000 Mermaid: This Mini-Figure is a nice simple re-use of existing parts, with a new hairpiece (I believe) and a Starfish piece.</p>
<p>The Mermaid re-uses the new Fish Tail piece first introduced with Whitecap Bay, this time it's in blue, a colour we have seen before with Sirena of Whitecap Bay, however the scale detailing on the front is different, matching the design first used with the Ocean King. Her upper torso has a seashell bra printed on the front and a small necklace with a conk shell design, while her facial print is once again simple. Much like the Forest Maiden she is not wearing lipstick here, but lips are visible and she's smiling.</p>
<p>The hairpiece is nice, I say it is new, but it does seem to bear a resemblance to Elisabeth Swann's, although I'm pretty sure Miss Swann wasn't ever officially produced as a Mini-Figure. (Perhaps we'll be seeing her return with the new PotC film in 2015, and hopefully a re-vist of that Theme.) The starfish is an interesting piece, although as accessories go it is a bit odd to see the Mermaid holding another animal from the sea.</p>
<p>Overall I'd strongly recommend this Mini-Figure for army building purposes, with a bit of swapping around of parts between other Female Mini-Figures you could populate Whitecap Bay, or any other undersea Diorama/MOC with a bevy of beautiful and diverse Mermaids, in fact you could even make your own Princess Ariel if you wanted. Definitely a great offering from Series 9.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
"sideswinger","2022-03-05T14:47:21.953Z","EXTRAVAGANT!","<p>Hey guys! Sideswinger here, and today we&#39;re taking a look at the Series 9 Mermaid! This minifigure released way back in 2013 for three bucks, and she includes 6 pieces. Now let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that blonde yellow hair piece, which is a recoloured piece from the LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean line. I really love that hair piece, and it really is one of my favourite hair pieces in the entire world of LEGO. I think it fits the figure extremely well, and it has some excellent moulding, especially around the back and the top. I love how this was an exclusive colour made especially for this figure as well.</p>

<p>Next is her face, and this is, of course, an exclusive head print. Her little smile is pretty great, and I actually love generic CMF face prints, as they&#39;re always highly useful outside of the setting. Of Course, she has no alternate expression, which is to be expected from a 2013 CMF.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which has more fantastic printing. I feel like some people might be offended by how scantily dressed she is, but in the&nbsp;end, this is just a LEGO Minifigure, so that&#39;d be absurd. I love that small, purple necklace hanging around her neck, and it&#39;s interesting how those clams are printed on the chest. Of course she does not have any back torso printing, but that sort of makes sense, considering she doesn&#39;t really have anything on.</p>

<p>Moving on, we have that mermaid tail. While it may seem as if, that piece itself is not new to the figure. However, getting it in that colour, alongside that printing, did, indeed, make it exclusive to this figure. I adore all those intricate scales on the front, which give off a nice silver shine. Of course, that tail juts out the back, and there&#39;s some good moulded detail on the tips of the fins.</p>

<p>Her accessory is pretty great, being as it is that starfish. It isn&#39;t a new mould, but it was new in that colour, being as it is caste in orange. I really love how that piece looks, with the handle bar on top, and that solid stud in the middle. I think it&#39;s an extremely fitting accessory, and I&#39;m glad LEGO chose an interesting accessory for an already fantastic minifigure.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, Series 9 is in my top 5 favourite series&#39;, and I think that&#39;s partly because of this Mermaid figure. I love every single piece on this character, from the long blonde hair, to the smiley face, to the torso, tail, and even the starfish. This character is one of my favourites in the whole&nbsp;series, and I&#39;m gonna give her a 5 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review! Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoyed!</p>
