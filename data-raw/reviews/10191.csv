<p>The Forest Maiden is dressed in a dark green dress, similar to Fiona from Shrek, the printing on it is not as cluttered as other Mini-Figures more simpler with a few minor bits of detail work. Including a pouch on her belt/sash combination, the ties used to secure the dress in the front near the bosom and some trim detailing on the bottom and near the neckline.</p>
<p>Her facial print is just as subdued, a simple looking smiling expression without any lipstick, but noticeable lips. The rich dark green coloring of her outfit is a welcome addition, it's rare to see this colouring used on Mini-Figures. Her accessories are; the bow from the Elf, and a large shield with a tree printed on the front, hence why I mentioned Gondor in the title of this review, I believe that this might hint at the fact that later LotR sets might give us a similar shield with the Gondor Tree on it. Or re-use this very print/pattern in Gondor colors to save on costs.</p>
<p>Her hairpiece however alludes to a different character, the hair is a nice light red tone with&nbsp;long hair&nbsp;flowing down her back, there is also a molded in detail of the braids we've seen on Princess Leia during her time at the Ewok village. This leads me to suspect that we may be seeing an Endor Dress Leia Mini-Figure in the future, using this exact same hairpiece.</p>
<p>Overall I strongly recommend getting this Mini-Figure, she's a great companion piece for the Classic Castle Era Forestmen, just like the Forestman from Series 1 of the CMF was. Trying to get more than one of her will proove tricky, as she is packed 2 to each case, that being said I strongly suggest you try to get more than one of her for all the rich colours and parts used here. I'm going to at least try to find one more before Series 9 leaves Retailer shelves.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4

Sideswinger here, and today we&#39;re going to be taking a closer look at the LEGO Minifigures Series 9 Forest Maiden. This figure was released in January, 2013, where it retailed for only $2.99. She includes 7 pieces. Now let&#39;s just take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that hair piece, which is long, with moulded-in braids. Now technically that piece was designed for Princess Leia, but this was the first time we ever actually got it in a set. It&#39;s caste in a nice burnt orange colour, and the moulded detail all around it is superb, especially at the back, where we get all kinds of incredible detailing. I dig all the moulded work surrounding it, and the braids at the front are very nicely done.</p>

<p>Next is her face, which has a very generic expression. I actually dig plain minifigure expressions, as it expands the customization value of the head. I do like how the eyebrows continue the orange hair colour.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which does have some good printing. I like the brown belt, as well as that little brown pouch. I can almost see that torso being used for a custom Link minifigure, from Legend of Zelda. Another thing I like about the torso is the tan colour used for the arms.</p>

<p>Next is her dress, which includes some good printing. Of course it is the older style dress piece, since the new design wasn&#39;t introduced until 2018. I like the detail at the front, and how that brown strap hangs down. I also like the wrinkles at the sides, and the brown trim at the bottom looks superb.</p>

<p>The last thing on this minifigure to talk about is the accessories. I actually really love both pieces, as they&#39;re both really great accessories. I like the brown bow and arrow piece, which is very fitting for an elf figure, and I really dig the printing on that shield, which represents a nice little tree.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this minifigure! Overall, Series 9 is one of my favourite series&#39; ever, and while this figure isn&#39;t anything insane, she isn&#39;t bad by a long shot. I think it&#39;s a pretty good gender swap of the Series 3 Elf, though she isn&#39;t quite as good as that figure was. All in all, I&#39;m gonna give this character a 3 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thank you guys for reading. I truly appreciate all the readers who took the time to take a look at this. I hope you enjoyed!</p>
