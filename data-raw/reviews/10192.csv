"Odeinoichus","2013-02-07T20:30:10.797Z","The Odyssey by LEGO","<p>Set #71000 Cyclops: This Mini-Figure is highly detailed and quite fun, he's also one of the easier to find from the Series, I suspect many of you already have multiples of this one. Indeed I myself am tempted to seek out a second for my collection, he's got loads of potential and the parts are pretty fun. (Even if we have seen his club before with the Caveman and Cavewoman.)</p>
<p>The Cyclops is one of the few in Series 9 with double-sided printing, for the torso and the head. He's got dull green skin with mottled yellow colouring on his chest, and he's wearing a belt of some kind for his furry shorts. The printing carries over to the back showing the muscles and the back of his belt. The headpiece is greatly detailed, I'm not sure how many re-uses LEGO will get out of it, perhaps they'll make a Female Cyclops in the future, but it's a great new mold.</p>
<p>The legs show off some printing for his furry shorts, speaking of which this Mini-Figure looks like he might be useful for making your own LEGO Masters of the Universe character, I mean he's wearing furry shorts. The two prints on his face are a wide-opened look and the other is a half-closed eye. As though he were squinting or something, I must admit it looks very wierd with the headpiece on, but pretty neat.</p>
<p>Overall, you're going to love this Mini-Figure, he's one that will be greatly appreciated I feel and great to have multiples of. Strongly recommended, also he makes a great companion with the Series 6 Minotaur, I kind of hope we see more figures in the future of this type, like the Gorgon/Medusa and some sort of Titan or something.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
"sideswinger","2021-08-17T02:45:25.967Z","FANTASTIC!!!","<p>The second minifigure found in the LEGO Minifigures series 9 is the Cyclops. He includes 6 pieces, retailed for three dollars, and was released way back in the year 2013. So let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>It may seem like his head is one whole mould, but it&#39;s actually two separate pieces: the classic LEGO Minifigure head, and the cyclops head, which acts as a sort-of mask piece. The cyclops piece which covers the head was a new part for the figure, and the white horn and teeth are all prints. I like the wrinkles at the top around the horn, and the big ears are great touches. Of course, that mouth with the teeth sticking out looks pretty great, and I like the wrinkle around his one, big eye. Obviously, the green colour it&#39;s caste in fits really&nbsp;well.</p>

<p>And once again, that big eye underneath is printed on its own individual minifigure head, which is strange, and granted; it does look slightly weird and creepy. But it&#39;s almost creepy in a cute way. Funny enough, he has a mouth printed underneath the mouth on the mask, and the figure even has an alternate expression, where his eye is half closed in a cheeky way. Again, the mouth is printed underneath it, which also has a very cheeky expression.</p>

<p>Next we have his torso, which features some fantastic detail, with that big belt, and even the furry belly and chest. Another thing that&#39;s really incredible is that he features some great back torso printing, which is a continuation of that belt, and also a slight bit of back muscles.</p>

<p>Next is his legs, which have some nice sand blue printing. I like how it has that ripped look, and I like how the top section is totally caste in sand blue, because that makes it look better, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessory which is that club caste in grey. I love the inclusion of that piece since it fits extremely well, and I don&#39;t know whether or not it was new to the figure in that colour; I just know that it looks great, and that it isn&#39;t as common as the normal brown colouring it&#39;s mostly caste in.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, this is a fantastic figure, especially in 2013. I think he comes in as my second favourite in the entire series, not only for looks, but for the amount of detail included. I love that he has two expressions, and how even his accessory is pretty good, being that club. So overall, I&#39;m gonna give this dude a solid 5 out of 5! That is all for this review, so thanks for reading!</p>
