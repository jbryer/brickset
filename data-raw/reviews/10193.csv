What's not to love?","<p>I'm a Star Wars Lego lover, and very few sets tempt me away, mostly from fear of how expensive getting hooked by another theme would be! But from the moment I knew there was a chicken suit guy in this series I've wanted him. I got him this afternoon from the Lego shop in Cardiff; there's one cashier who can tell you exactly which figure is in the bag just by feeling it - he said he's been doing it since series 3, he's very good at it, and he tipped the whole box out on the counter to find this one for me! Great service! (We were buying a larger set or two with it though, I wouldn't want to take liberties!)</p><p>The figure is top class. Somehow I was a bit disappointed that the body is plain, I'm not sure what I was expecting! But frankly who cares about the body when the 'arms' attached to it are wings?!&nbsp;As far as I can tell it's actually symmetrical too, which made me wonder as I put it together (it seemed the wrong way round either way round until you put the head on!). I assume the wings and helmet are new&nbsp;moulds&nbsp;and they really are rather good! The face is pulling a great expression, and when the hat's on he look fantastic, like he's on his way to a fancy dress party and he knows first prize is already his! The red brightens up the plain torso very well too. The leg printing is great, with the white at the top matched very closely to the white of the hips, and a very simple set of red claws painted on the toes. And I'm not sure if it's a new colour or not, but the base colour of the legs is a very deep yellow/orange, which, with the red of the hat, gives him the perfect amount of colour.</p><p>Pros</p>
<ul><li>Great moulded wings and chicken-head hat</li><li>There's something innately cool about a Lego version of a man in a chicken suit!</li><li>It's so cool it counts twice - it's a Lego man in a chiken suit!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Nit-picking, the torso is very plain colour-wise, but the wings, legs and helmet more than make up for it</li></ul>
<p>Summary: Lego man in chicken suit! Wings instead of arms! You need him in your life! Done.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-02-08T12:44:03.557Z","It Feels Like Chicken Tonight...","<p>Set #71000 Chicken Suit Guy: Mini-Figures in costumes are always good fun, but is this Mini-Figure truly one of the best from Series 9? I'd have to say no, he's a great looking Mini-Figure, however I'm afraid he's just a bit plain looking.</p>
<p>The Chicken Suit Guy has leg printing, showing the bottom of his chicken costume and the clawed talons that are probably just soft soled shoes with felt stuck on them. Or a mascot based uniform. The point is however that this is it for the printing, I could understand if they didn't want to go crazy detailed by adding a ton of feather printing on the torso to save on costs, considering he's got two brand new arm pieces attached to his torso instead of regular Mini-Figure arms. But why not give him a zipper in the back at least so you know which way the torso is supposed to face? (Yes it does work either way, but if the Gorilla Suit Guy had a zipper on his back and I assume Lizard Dude has one too as I don't own one yet, shouldn't this have one also?)</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, this is a unique and impressive looking Mini-Figure and a lot of AFOLS, TFOLS and KFOLS are going to get a kick out of him and his funny look, he'd make a great mascot for a Chicken Licken/Chicken Delight or whatever other Chicken based Restaurant you'd like to MOC, or for some sports team even. And he's really worth picking up, and should be easy to find with the unique torso, I just don't believe he's one of the best from the set. With a unique headpiece and a big smiling facial print he's great fun though, and I wouldn't mind seeing LEGO re-use this torso for Turkey Suit Guy (or Girl) and maybe Duck Suit Dude (As long as the Duck isn't plain white, more like a Mallard or something.) so here's hoping we see future uses in that vein, the torso would make a great piece to use for a Thanksgiving Based Pagent Mini-Figure set. Anyway I'm going on too long, recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2022-01-18T22:43:56.78Z","BEST In the SERIES???","<p>Hey everyone! Sideswinger here, this time reviewing the LEGO Minifigures series 9 Chicken Suit Guy. Per the checklist, this is the seventh character in the series, and if you need some background on him, this is the fourth CMF animal suit in the entire theme. This figure was released way back in the golden year of 2013, which was back when CMF&#39;s retailed for a comparatively incredible price of three bucks a pop. This specific character only includes four pieces, if you don&#39;t count the display stand. With that, let&#39;s get in closer for a better look!</p>

<p>Starting off the character is that chicken mask piece, which was, of course, new for the minifigure. I personally adore that part of the figure, and I think it might be my favourite part of this&nbsp;entire character. From what I&#39;ve gathered thanks to various YouTube videos, I don&#39;t believe the comb nor the wattle are dual-moulded. Rather, I think the red is printed. It still looks fantastic, though dual-moulding is normally a lot crisper in design. I love the black eyes printed above the beak, and speaking of which, that orange beak is printed, rather than dual-moulded.</p>

<p>Next is his face, and I love that head piece nearly as much as I adore the mask. It&#39;s such a generic face that it&#39;s hard not to fall in love with. I love how useful it is outside the setting, and it looks great inside the mask. That print is still exclusive, despite looking a bit similar to some other CMF face designs. Unfortunately, he does not have any alternative expressions, but that&#39;s okay, since that primary face is so great.</p>

<p>The next thing to discuss is that torso, and while the body itself is not exclusive, those furry arms were new to the figure. I&#39;m in love with those designs, though they are admittedly a bit overused in this day and age. I actually believe those parts are most commonly found in white, but they still aren&#39;t super common. For example, I own a whopping number of sets, and I still don&#39;t have those wings in mt collection. There isn&#39;t any printing on the torso, but I think it looks great as a plain white surface, to be honest.</p>

<p>Next is his legs. I do wish there was some sort of tail piece connected between the torso and legs, but that&#39;s just a nit-pick. Those legs actually have some incredible detailing. I love those dark orange claws printed on the feet, and the white feathers on top look good, despite the distracting lack of side detail.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, I have a lot to say about this. First off, back in 2013, when this was released, it was so incredible and fresh that everybody fell in love with it! That&#39;s very understandable, because he&#39;s a great figure. But over the years, we&#39;ve gotten so many minifigures that are basically spin-offs of this character, that this original one has sort of waned in my mind. Heck, we got an almost identical counterpart to this in a promotional set not too long after this released. But even considering all that, this was still an incredible figure back in the day, and it still&nbsp;holds up even in this day and age. I think he&#39;s one of the strongest, if not the strongest, in the series, and I&#39;m going to reward him with a 5 out of 5. That is it for this review! Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope you enjoyed, and I have several other in-depth reviews of CMF&#39;s on my account, if you&#39;re interested. Thanks for reading!</p>
