"Odeinoichus","2013-02-07T21:36:19.063Z","Roller Derby Fun","<p>Set #71000 Roller Derby Girl: This is a pretty decent looking Mini-Figure, although I must admit that not too many people will know much about Roller Derbies, I myself have limited knowledge concerning the sport. Still the pieces and the print on this Mini-Figure and the fact she's a female character definitely make her one of the more desireable ones from Series 9.</p>
<p>Print wise she's got a decent looking single-sided torso (I'd prefer double-sided though.) with the number 49 on her right breast and what I assume to be team colours on the left. (White and blue markings) She also has knee-pads printed on her legs and elbow pads printed on her arms, a rare sight indeed. She's wearing a protective helmet in blue with a star symbold printed on it and her face looks like someone who participates in sports.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, she includes a new pair of skates. Roller skates, not Ice Skates, a great new piece, it's such a shame that this Mini-Figure only comes two to a case making it harder to stock up on the parts for other Mini-Figures. Overall though I think this one will be a great collectible item, someone to look forward to owning, and also with the new Roller Skates I can see a lot of re-uses in future Series down the line. (Though we haven't yet seen a return of the Ice Skates.) Strongly Recommend tracking a few down.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4

Sideswinger here, and you might have clicked on this review because you seen it in the side bar of the Brickset homepage. Or maybe you found this while exploring old CMF&#39;s. Whatever the case, you&#39;ve made a good choice! This is a full, in-depth look of the LEGO Minifigures Series 9 Roller Derby Girl. She was released in 2013, retailed for 3 dollars (2 Euro), and includes 7 pieces. Now, let&#39;s get a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting at the top, we have that protective helmet, which is caste in a bright blue colour. If I had to guess, I would say it&#39;s new to the figure in that colour, but I don&#39;t know that for sure. What I do know, is that the piece is exclusive thanks to that star print. I really like the big red emblem at the centre, and I think that piece could be used for, say, a custom Captain America minifigure. It&#39;s a great piece, but I sort of wish this set included an alternate hair-piece for the character.</p>

<p>Next is her head, which does, of course, have an exclusive expression. I really love that angry look, with the snarling mouth. I like how pointy her eyebrows are as well; they get the determined message across. This figure has no alternate expression, which is good, since it&#39;d be seriously exposed at the back.</p>

<p>Next is her torso and arms, both of which feature decent detail. I appreciate the blue &quot;49&quot; on her chest, and the white and blue stripes give&nbsp;the character an interesting feature. Unfortunately, she does not have back torso printing, which stinks; I would&#39;ve loved to&#39;ve seen those stripes carry on to the back. Her arms, however, feature some nice printing, which is surprising, considering side-arm printing isn&#39;t even necessary.</p>

<p>The next thing to discuss is her legs, which have more good printing. I really like those knee-guard designs, though it&nbsp;would&#39;ve been nice if they carried on to the sides.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her roller skates, which were new to the figure. It&#39;s weird to say that, since we get them so often in sets nowadays. I adore those pieces though, even though they are so common. I like the moulded-in wheels, and that protective point which covers the toe is a great detail. I think many fans have underestimated just how cool those roller skate pieces really are. And, once again, they were new for the figure.</p>

<p>That is it for this review! Before I say anything about this particular character, I wanna say that Series 9 is fantastic overall, and it&#39;s one of my favourite series&#39; LEGO has put out. Of course, Series 9 has a few weak characters, those being the Waiter, Mr. Good and Evil, and... this Roller Derby Girl. Those new skates can&#39;t save this character for me. She just falls short compared to all the other minifigures, and I actually think she&#39;s my least favourite of the entire series. However, with that being said, the thought behind this concept is admittedly pretty great! Overall, I&#39;m going to, unfortunately, give this minifigure a 2 out of 5. Anyways, that&#39;s all I got for this review! I hope you enjoyed, and if you&#39;re interested, check out my other CMF reviews. Thanks for reading!</p>
