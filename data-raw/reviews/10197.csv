This game is one of the first I've managed to pick up from the more recent offering of LEGO games, I still want all of them, but I find it tricky to get them all when you're budget is set up a certain way for collectibles.</p>
<p>The basic formula for a LEGO Video Game from Traveller's Tales is pretty much standard by now, take a familiar licensed name, LEGOize it, include hundreds of breakable items, interactive puzzles, playable characters and fun-filled stages with mini-kit canisters to collect and you've pretty much got the LEGO Game formula down to a well honed art. That being said, recently Traveller's Tales has been expanding their basic formula to include even more fun, to revitalize the franchise as it were. Let's face it playing the same game over and over again with different characters would tend to get stale after a while.</p>
<p>With Lord of the Rings they've changed it up considerably, instead of one tiny hubworld you have an expansive, explorable realm with quests to complete, puzzles to figure out, items to collect and characters to un-lock. It isn't the same as the older games where you could walk up to a single location to buy your characters, instead you have to search for them all over Middle-Earth, battle them and then you can unlock them all with the studs you've collected.</p>
<p>Adapting a film series as dark as The Lord of the Rings can get into a child friendly LEGO version can be tricky, the basic story is quite well known and a lot of the scenes, particularily involving the Ringwraiths, or the battles in Two Towers and Return of the King can get quite dark and even sinister/fearful for a child. And yet The LEGO Team at TT was up to the challenge, here you will find the typical brand of LEGO Humor thrown in which can ease your child into the world of Tolkien. As I'm certain younger children than the reccomended age range will want to play and enjoy the game alongside their ten-year old brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Each film is expressed through six stages each, wonderfully hillarious cut scenes, with dialogue taken straight out of the film. Aside from studs and Mini-Kits you are also on the look out for special Quest Items that become available in your Treasure Tomb/Pack and ultimately you are aiming to retrieve 250 Mythril Bricks so that you can build Mythril LEGO Objects, which are like enhanced versions of ordinary objects used by characters in the game. As always red bricks unlock extras, each quest item you find has one of three purposes, it allows you to alter the appearance of characters with different armor and head parts, fulfill fetch quests for characters found all around Middle-Earth, mostly for Mythril Bricks, but each mini-hub&nbsp;area such as Isengard includes a character that will give you a Red Brick for an item. And they also allow certain characters to perform tasks that usually can only be done by an Elf like Legolas or a Dwarf like Gimili.</p>
<p>The hub-world of Middle-Earth is broken up into massive sprawling country-sides and also smaller areas with self-contained quests and mythril bricks to track down by completing certain puzzles. You start out in the Shire after the first level set in the Second Age of Middle-Earth, and your journey will take you to the Prancing Pony at Bree, the crumbling ruins of Weathertop, the majestic beauty of Rivendell, the frightening pathways of Moria and the Pass of Charadras and everywhere up to and including through the Black Gates into Mordor.</p>
<p>The game is brilliant fun, there are a few key things to note however. While there is a linear path you can follow, when the Fellowship is divided you can tackle the stages for Frodo and Sam, or Aragorn and Company in any order you wish, provided the Great Eye of Sauron isn't blocking your progress, as it can do if you get too far ahead of one party or the other. Free Play mode for Middle-Earth is only accessible after you complete the Main Story mode for all three films, so you have to beat all eighteen stages before you can start exploring with characters you unlock during your travels such as Saruman the White or an Uruk-Hai.</p>
<p>This being a LEGO Game it is not entirely devoid of Glitches, especially as this is the Wii version and sometimes there are certain problems that crop up. Sometimes in Free Play mode for stages the AI can be really dumb, when you need a Dwarf for example to progress you'll have to manually change the character back to a Dwarf then switch to your other character so you can finish off the puzzle and continue forward. Middle-Earth is large, and sometimes you might get lost, or trapped somewhere a character might glitch out and cause problems. (Thankfully I haven't yet run into the dreaded Frozen Whine glitch that forces you to shut down your Wii. Though I have heard that some copies can do this.)</p>
<p>Also the Cut Scenes, these will play in Story Mode or Free Play mode and don't seem to have any way to shut them off, so you're forced to skip them every time you replay a stage in Free Play mode. Also, certain moments of a stage force you to use one character above any other, even in Free Play mode. You can't fight Saruman, for example, without Gandalf in the second stage of the game, and other levels make you use Frodo and only Frodo and won't let you switch out to any other character. I'm not sure why the programmers did this, but thankfully they planned ahead, in Free Play mode these characters forced to be used can access the Backpack (as the game calls it) and pull out tools such as axes or bows that allow them to use different characters' skills.</p>
<p>The Character Customizer is also not accessible until after you beat the Main Story mode, which the Instructions omit for whatever reason, they don't tell you this and so it can be frustrating for someone who wants to start making their own crazy mixed up characters right at the beginning.</p>
<p>Another problem is the method for changing your characters, sometimes the game will swap you to your other character while you're trying to access the characters in Free Play mode from the selectable wheel, because you have to press down and hold the same button for both types of character selection it can cause moments of frustration and annoyance, especially when you're climbing up one of the long towers or structures in the Hubworld and need to swap out to a different character, instead it sends you down to the other character left on the ground and you'll find that the AI isn't smart enough to stop moving the character, instead you could switch back to find that the AI has started walking it off the ledge forcing you to repeat several steps just to climb up to collect a Mythril Brick or unlock one of the hidden characters of Middle-Earth. Really poor planning on the game creator's part.</p>
<p>Overall though, this game is well worth picking up. It features the same brand of fun that a lot of the other LEGO Games have included, and does it all with breathtaking, goregeous scenery, I mean just looking at all the wonderful images of Middle-Earth is well worth it alone. The game is rich with detail, some details only a big Tolkien fan/nerd would even get, and it's all in the LEGO style. A few hiccups down the road aren't going to sour your enjoyment of the game, as long as you are aware of these issues before you start playing and know what to expect you won't have any problem enjoying the game. One thing however that is a bit of a nuissance no matter how great the gameplay mechanics are, is the insufferable load times. This game has load screens that can last a good five minutes depending on the amount of stuff to generate digitally, even in the middle of a stage there will be a load screen, which is a bit dissapointing, though understandable as this game is trying to accomplish a lot.</p>
<p>I still strongly reccomend this game to anyone who is fans of what TT has been doing, fans of Lord of the Rings and LEGO combined will find it quite fun and enjoy it a great deal in spite of any flaws mentioned above. And watching Gollum or Sauron dance while you hold out your Mythril Disco Phial can be both creepy, funny and charming all at the same time.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
"Telcontar","2013-03-27T22:48:24.34Z","Best LEGO Game yet!","<p>First of all, I&#39;m a <em>huge </em>LotR fan and when I heard about this game I was thrilled.&nbsp; Finally, a LEGO LotR game!&nbsp; Being a Middle-earth fanatic I was probably biased from the start, but thankfully I don&#39;t have to lie when I say that this is probably the best LEGO game yet.</p>

<p><strong>The Hub</strong></p>

<p>The biggest difference between this game and the others is probably the hub.&nbsp; Based on past LEGO games I was expecting them to start you out in Bag End.&nbsp; Then as you progressed in the game you unlocked more of Hobbiton.&nbsp; Oh was I ever wrong!&nbsp; The hub is <em>huge, enormous!&nbsp; </em>Batman 2 was big, this is bigger.&nbsp; It&#39;s practically every part of Middle-earth we see in the Lord of the Rings (sorry, you can&#39;t get to Mirkwood, Hobbit game perhaps?).&nbsp; The first level is the prologue, after that&nbsp;you&nbsp;begin in Hobbiton and as you progress through the story the more map you open up until you can walk anywhere.&nbsp; However, you can&#39;t switch to whatever guy&nbsp;you want in the hub until you&#39;ve beaten all the story levels.&nbsp; Consequently you won&#39;t be able to get all the&nbsp;hidden items&nbsp;for a while.&nbsp; Speaking hidden items there are hundreds .&nbsp; The most common are Mithril Bricks which you can then take to the blacksmith shop in Bree to forge into&nbsp;(sometimes funny)&nbsp;items.&nbsp;&nbsp;But that&#39;s not all, in levels and&nbsp;sometimes around the hub you have to find designs for these Mithril objects.&nbsp; Then you can give most of these newly forged items to people around the hub as part of fetch quests.&nbsp; Once you give the Mithril item to the minifigure he/she will give you a Red Brick to buy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was greatly surprised about some of the things in the hub.&nbsp; Things that are in the book but not in the film.&nbsp; A great example of this would be Tom Bombadil and his house.&nbsp; He was completely omitted from the film (much to the dismay of some) yet he&#39;s in the game.&nbsp; No Goldberry though.&nbsp; Still, pretty neat.</p>

<p>My only disappointment with the hub is the Minas Tirith section.&nbsp; Once you go in the&nbsp;main gate&nbsp;it automatically takes you to the citadel, no city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gameplay is like most previous &nbsp;LEGO games.&nbsp; There&#39;s tons of stuff to destroy and collect.&nbsp; Each level has 10 treasure chests, a design (to use for Mithril Bricks), and three artifacts (that you use in the hub to give to people) which are hidden throughout the game.&nbsp; In between portions of the level video clips are used to advance the story.&nbsp; Compared to other games it seems like there are more of these.&nbsp; Perhaps this is because of the dialog.&nbsp; For the first time in a LEGO game the&nbsp;dialog from the film is used.&nbsp;&nbsp;All the clips are still&nbsp;extremely funny yet it helps add a lot of meaning and depth to the game.&nbsp; I enjoyed it and I think it really helped the story make&nbsp;more sense.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I said before the puzzles are a lot like most LEGO games.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often times you have to find things&nbsp;to build you&#39;re way out of someplace.&nbsp; Other times you have to methodically and cleverly destroy a large obstacle, etc.&nbsp; Then there are simple&nbsp;button masher parts.&nbsp; Often times&nbsp;during the game (like in the Dead Marshes) you have to hide from&nbsp;a Ringwraith which was&nbsp;fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only complaint is that they almost completely omitted the Minas Tirith side of the story. The siege that takes place there in the Return of the King would&#39;ve made for an awesome level.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Characters</strong></p>

<p>The characters&nbsp;and items in this game are vast and varied.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing them in the game really makes me hope that we get them in&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Guard of the Citadel guys looks especially cool.&nbsp; One of the new developments in this game is the &quot;weapons rack&quot;.&nbsp; This feature allows&nbsp;a character&nbsp;to hold multiple items (7 or 8 I think...?).&nbsp; A similar&nbsp;tool is used for switching between guys in&nbsp;level (and in the hub).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t really rate this part considering it&#39;s only a disc.&nbsp; The packaging was nice though.&nbsp; In the end I just gave it a 5, the same&nbsp;score I gave&nbsp;it overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Overall I love this game, it&#39;s my favorite one yet.&nbsp; Of course, being a LotR fan I probably enjoy it more than most.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;I&#39;ve heard from many others (who are not LotR fans) that they thoroughly enjoy(ed) this game.&nbsp; It&#39;s so nice to have a video game that&#39;s not full of violence, swearing, and blood.&nbsp;&nbsp;LEGO&nbsp;has been and is making quality video games that are age appropriate for nearly anyone and it is truly a blessing.&nbsp; Keep it up LEGO!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
