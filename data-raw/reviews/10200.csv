To that end I have been slowly working to get all of their vehicle sets and Speedorz. Some of the Eagle Tribe vehicles are excellent, some are not exactly what I&rsquo;d call the best and so we shall cover the good points, the bad and everything in between for Eglor&rsquo;s Twin Bike.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is a great looking eye catching design that really shows off the awesome features of this set and includes some great photo work to hide the flaws of the set as best as possible. Wait, flaws? Yep, but we&rsquo;ll get to that, and while the box design does minimize these flaws it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s a terrible box. Great looking design that really stands out.</p>

<p>The instructions for this set are thick, thicker than you might expect. There are a lot of pages here detailing the build through two numbered bags, and showing off more of the great 2013 Chima sets. In the middle of the manual you&rsquo;ll find the minifigure checklist with all the 2013 Minifigs. Definitely nice to see this.</p>

<p>Great easy to follow instructions and some awesome looking extra pages, LEGO&rsquo;s manual designs have really grown since the early 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set has four dark blue wings, two white wings, two massive wheels and some nice blue hubcap pieces. There are also three more purple wings, not much in the way of useful parts. However I do admit this is a pretty good parts pack.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>This set includes two Minifigures, an Eagle Tribe member and a Raven Tribe member. Actually, considering the price of this set I&rsquo;m surprised they didn&rsquo;t include a third minifigure since most 30$ sets tend to have three.</p>

<p>Eglor: This version of Eglor is identical to the one found in Nest Dive, he has a double-sided torso just like before, leg printing a double-sided face and a head piece, all of which are a nice rich dark blue colour. This makes him unique among the Eagle Tribe, one thing I didn&rsquo;t bring up in Nest Dive was the fact that one side has a robotic eye while the other side does not, showing that he uses it probably during races or battles, but not when he&rsquo;s just doing other stuff.</p>

<p>His weapon is two chains attached to a golden Lightsaber hilt with two Chi studs on the other end, I have no idea what it is called or how effective this weapon is but it does give you two short gold chains which are different and great if you&rsquo;re looking for those parts in that colour.</p>

<p>Razcal: this version of Razcal is pretty much identical to the one from Razcal&rsquo;s Glider so there isn&rsquo;t much different to discuss here. His print is the same, the only thing different is his strange weapon. I have no idea what it could do, or how effective it will be however I think it&rsquo;s still a nice weapon. Also he&rsquo;s using a different shoulder armor here, this one has the thicker spiky looking shoulder pads of the ground tribes.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say both Minifigures are welcome additions, but like I said for a set at this price it should have three.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>In this set there are two numbered bags, the first bag includes the minifigures, the small Raven Tribe vehicle and the wheeled undercarriage of the twin bike. Bag number two includes the upper portion of the twin bike and that about covers it.</p>

<p>I like the little Raven Tribe vehicle build, it&rsquo;s a nice miniature helicopter type vehicle designed to help the ravens move in to snatch the Chi crystals, it also has a nice colour scheme with black, dark red and the purple wing pieces. The build is just all around fun.</p>

<p>The Twin Bike uses most of the pieces and I do like the design and build of this set, the large chunky wheels make this vehicle look like it can tear down barriers erected by the wolves or crocodiles in order to escape with the Chi crystals. It is a nice satisfying build with an eagle on top of a monster bike. I do wish there were printed details instead of stickers for this set though, the stickers look nice and add a nifty bit of detailing to the vehicle. Unfortunately it is just stickers, so it&rsquo;s a bit of a downer because of that.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This is one vehicle that is really fun to play with, as a bike, unfortunately this is actually a transforming vehicle. It can go from ground mode into flight mode and while most often I find the design of these types of vehicles clever and fun, in this case I&rsquo;d say this model is seriously flawed.</p>

<p>It has no real place to grab it while in flight configuration, the chunky thick wheels that look so great in bike mode make the model look way too goofy looking and ungainly as a flying vehicle.</p>

<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t be so bad if they weren&rsquo;t showing off this feature on the box and making it look ten times cooler than it actually is because of the angle of the image they used for this feature.</p>

<p>Another minor flaw is the size of the kickstands, they&rsquo;re a bit too short to work right and the chunky wheels tend to want to lean over even when they are deployed. This is why the completed model suffers a bit, I mean I love the look and feel of this set, I&rsquo;m just not in love with the ability for it to adopt a flying form. Was it really needed?</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say that this set is pretty decent for a bike, unfortunately the design of the transformation for the second form is a bit flawed and the flying bike has a pretty difficult time being held properly or played with. The minifigures are fun too and I dig the little raven tribe personal copter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say this set is recommended for the main bike model and everything else, however I&rsquo;d suggest trying to MOC a better flight build for it as that form isn&rsquo;t the best thought out design. Either that or leave it as a bike permanently.</p>
