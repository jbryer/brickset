"Brickmiser","2014-04-25T21:57:19.907Z","got me hooked on Chima!","<p>Prior to building this set I had no interest in the Chima line altogether. I usually stick to the larger, more adult oriented sets like&nbsp;Star Wars UCS, modular buildings, and one-offs like the Simpsons House and Sydney Opera House. The only reason I purchased this set was because it was discounted by 50% on Amazon--and what serious Lego collector can pass up a 664 piece Lego set for $35? I figured it was a good value for Lego pieces, not necessarily the set itself, so I bought two of them. It wasn&#39;t until sometime later when I was watching designer videos for new sets that I stumbled upon the designer video for this set located here:&nbsp; www.lego.com/en-us/chima/videos/designervideos/chima-model-70009. &nbsp;The video makes it evident how much thought was actually put into the design of the set, so for curiosity sake I decided to open one of mine and put it together. It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable builds I&#39;ve done so far this year, and that list includes the new Maersk Triple-E, Parisian Restaurant, Simpsons House, Sea Cow, and Ewok Village among many others.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Everything is pretty standard here. The box is brightly colored with vivid images and the back side shows how the Lair splits up in to five different vehicles.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I always assumed that Chima&nbsp;sets were full of unusual&nbsp;and unique parts that weren&#39;t very useful when&nbsp;building standard&nbsp;vehicle and city style&nbsp;MOCs. Boy was I wrong! This entire set is nothing but useful pieces. Lots of technic beams and connectors, various sized&nbsp;square and angled&nbsp;plates, and an abundance of different sloped bricks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As it turns out, I really liked the animal heads that fit over the standard minifigure head. It&#39;s a more interesting way to do it than just having molded animal heads. It gives the impression that these are half human/half animal creatures (if their arms and legs don&rsquo;t suggest that already).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simply put: a masterpiece. The creativity involved in this design was a pleasure to behold. The designer elegantly created a functional vehicle in the shape of a crouching wolf that has the remarkable&nbsp;ability to split into five separate vehicles along with jail cells and tool storage areas contained in the wolf&#39;s body. The best part of this build however, was the fact that there are almost no 1X1 pieces! Not that they aren&#39;t useful pieces of course, but 1X1 plates and bricks are the bane of my Lego building existence since I am a perfectionist&nbsp;and insist on perfectly aligning every piece.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Obviously this model is primarily aimed at kids, and it is simply packed with play value. The front &quot;claws&quot; pop off as two individual vehicles, helicopter blades fold out and up to lift the chopper off the wolf&#39;s back, the rear section detaches and the wheels fold in to form a motorcycle, and the back end of the main body is a jail for any prisoners taken during play. That being said, the perfectly proportioned wolf&#39;s head that houses the command seat of this vehicle and the way the entire model takes on the form of a crouching wolf is highly artistic. Functionality and looks come together in this set (and other Chima sets as well) to create nothing short of a Lego masterpiece.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was so impressed with this set it caused me to do two things: 1) write my first set review (out of over 200 sets, including every Star Wars UCS set from 10179 on);&nbsp;2) purchase 11 other Chima sets.</p>
