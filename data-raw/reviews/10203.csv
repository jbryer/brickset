<p>Parts:</p>

<p>You get a lot of useful brown curved slopes, the ice/water-wall pieces, the blue chi ball.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>There is a good selection of all the main Minifigs: Laval, Cragger, Eris, LaGravis... All the Chima-Fig. &nbsp;are colourful, detailed and really great designed.</p>

<p>Value:</p>

<p>If you get it 20% off the RRP its definetely worth every cent, especially&nbsp;for younger kids!</p>

<p>Overall/Playability:&nbsp;</p>

<p>If possible, I&acute;d give 6 out of 5 &nbsp;for playability - its just perfect.&nbsp;You get two lion bikes, a croc and an eagle&nbsp;vehicle. There is a fantastic technic shooter, which is&nbsp;movable in all directions. There is&nbsp;the trap function, there are hidden entrances and so many play features more. Overall an&nbsp;awesome lion castle with everything you need to play with hours and hours!</p>

"Faefrost","2017-01-17T05:29:41.397Z","The best most striking set of the Chima line","<p>Somewhere on Brickset Mark Stafford states that he was thinking of and homaging the classic Yellow Castle when he came up with this one. Well done Mark! This stands as a high point of the Chima line, one of the best sets from the unbelievably talented Mr. Stafford, who has a plethora of truly great sets to his name, and it is an all time great Lego set. Just amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box -&nbsp;</strong>The box is huge. The cover art gives a nice detailed impression of the shear scale of what is inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>The set comes with 7 minifigs. SOme of the best or hardest to get figures in the Chima line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lion-O... I mean Laval - He comes with his silver armor and heavy cape. He is a fairly common figure.</p>

<p>Longtooth - one of the more common Lion soldiers. He has a nice torso and leg printing design in dark tan and dark browns on his head. A very Spartan feel to him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>King Lagravis - perhaps the best figure in the set. The King in his gold armor with cape. He is gorgeous. With nice front/rear and leg printing. I love his bearded face.</p>

<p>Crawly - one of the Crocodile grunts. Nicely detailed. Fairly common.</p>

<p>Cragar - our lead bad guy. He comes with silver armor and a tatered red cape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Queen Ewald of the Eagles - Eris&#39;s mother I believe. I think she only comes in one other set. An eagle figure with the printed slope dress piece for legs. She has a lot of gold printing on her head to denote her royal status. She wears gold armor with white wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Razar&nbsp;- The Raven leader. He is a slight variant in this set, coming with Gold armor instead of his normal silver. He still has his nice red and silver facial details.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;If you love bright yellow and trans light blue this is the set for you.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build/Model -&nbsp;</strong>The main Castle is stunning with the elevated bridge leading through the wonderfully realized lion head. The whole thing give sthe impression of flowing water. One nice feature is the two side walls swing inwards to close in the Temple area, allowing the set to have a much smaller footprint. In a similar way to the Prince of Persia Alamut set. This is good, because with the walls out the set has a huge footprint. It does not fit well on shelves. The Castle itself is loaded with play features. Including launching two Lion Cycles.</p>

<p>The set also comes with four small vehicles. The two Lion Cycles mentioned above. A small Eagle flyer for Queen Ewald and a rather complex and mean looking tank tread Motorcycle for Cragar.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>This is a truly classic Lego set. One of the best of the &quot;non Castle&quot; Castles. Everything about it is eye catching, well detailed and fun.&nbsp;</p>

"DarthTaylortheWise","2021-02-21T20:55:50.527Z","Great for (Dis)Play","<p>Very tedious build, but lots of good pieces including the BURP (Big Ugly Rock Pieces) which I love. Lots of good minifigures, great for play. The side builds are great additions to the different tribes. Overall I&#39;m going to give this 5 stars, as it looks excellent on display, though it&#39;s quite breakable, learned that the hard way.</p>
