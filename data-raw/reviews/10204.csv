<p>Pieces: 647</p>

<p>Release Year: 2013</p>

<p>Price: US $69.99</p>

<h3><u><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></u></h3>

<p>The boxing for this set is larger due to its piece count and price, as expected. The front of the box has a great image of the entire set and some of the functions of it. The back of the box shows more of the play features and some more look sof the hideout as expected from a LEGO product.</p>

<p>The instructions are split up into a few booklets that vary in size. I never understood the reasoning behind this, but oh well. Other than that the instructions are of a typical LEGO set, clean, great graphics, easy, straight forward, and with fun pictures in the back.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 exactly what I expected comming from a LEGO Chima set.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Parts</strong></u></h3>

<p>There are alot of parts in this set and I cannot recall all of them. Some of the more special pieces would be the obvious golden chi piece which has occurred in one other set that I can recall. Also some of the tower/scaffolding like pieces in grey and brown are quite nice to use in MOCs. When I opened the set I was immediately met with the two large base plates implemented in this set. Those are probably the two pieces I find most useful in the set.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5 some good pieces but a surprising lack of special pieces for a set of its size.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Minifigures</strong></u></h3>

<p>5 minifigures in this set, 3 from teh Crocodile tribe and 2 from the Lion tribe. However surprisingly, no uniques!</p>

<p>Crominus:Comes in 2 other sets. (70006 and 70103). The king of the Crocodile tribe and he has great detail. All Chima characters do. He is also special due to the golden part of his head/helmet.</p>

<p>Cragger:Also comes in 2 other sets. (7006 and 70115). The son to Crominus and the guy causing alot of trouble at the hand of his sister. Again great detail in the figure.</p>

<p>Crug: In 3 other sets. (30252, 70002, and 70112). Probably my favorite Croc tribe member. He has 2 unique things that make him stand out. The darker brown skin tone where the rest of the tribe is all light or dark green. He also has the metal lower jaw which gives him alot of added character. Again a great all around minifigure.</p>

<p>Lennox: Altogether Lennox is in 5 other sets. (depends on armor he is wearing). (70104 for silver armor as in this set).</p>

<p>Leonidas: In 4 other sets. (30253, 70001, 70006, 70102).</p>

<p>Lennox and Leonidas are the two most common lion members. I was a little displeased with the assortment of minifigures in this set. The figures themselves are great, but the assortment is lacking. You can get all of these figures in cheaper sets 4 out of 5 of them from set 70006. Granted that is a larger set and more $$, but you then receive more figures and pieces.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5 Chima has great minifigures, some of the best I&#39;ve seen in 18+ years of collecting. However a unique figure in this set would have really increased its demand.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Build</strong></u></h3>

<p>As in typical LEGO sets the build process went through the minifigures, then the hovercraft and then the base in chunks. The build was not difficult to follow and had some interesting techniques for some of the parts. Got a little repetitious as the Croc head, and the two sides the the base are almost mirrors of the other.</p>

<p>Stickers: The set does contain some stickers as can be seen from the box. They add minute detail to the build, but do not change the look overall. The ones that probably add the most are the banner stickers.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 Good solid build.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Completed Model</strong></u></h3>

<p>The model looks good. The Croc head looks awesome. I love the fact that it can fall down and chomp on some unsuspecting lions. I also love the overall croc look to the base and think the designers executed that part of the build fantastically. However I have a few problems with it overall. First, I love the firing missiles from the base. I like them a whole lot better than flick-fire ones. But the turret doesn&#39;t swivel! I mean it would&#39;ve taken just a few more pieces. What are the crocodiles supposed to do, wait until the lions get exactly in front of it to shoot them? Also I feel alot of the room in the back of the base wasn&#39;t used as well as it could have been, just feels a bit sparse in the back. Last is the middle top portion of the hideout. Theres so much room there for something, but there&#39;s nothing. Crominus just stands there and snarls, could&#39;ve made a larger turret and moved it more towards the middle, that would&#39;ve been awesome.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5 Good looking set, but lacks in a few playability areas and could has alot more potential.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Price</strong></u></h3>

<p>Price for this set is US $69.99. Piece count is 647 with 5 minifigures.</p>

<p>Price-per-piece: $0.108. This is just above the $0.10 benchmark that I hold for all sets (personal preference). With Chima being a LEGO owned theme, most sets are under that mark, but obviously not all. However this set still fairs very well against alot of licensed themes that have higher price tags for their piece amounts.</p>

<p>Counting in Minifigures: 2 minifigures (7 pieces)(legs, torso, head, helmet, cape, armor, and chi) 1 Minifigure (6 pieces)(legs, torso, head, helmet, armor, and chi) and 2 minifigures (4 pieces)(legs, torso, head, and helmet) I count a minifigure as $3.00 The rest of the set would come out to $54.99 at 617 pieces. Price-per-piece: $0.089 which is great for a larger set.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5 great minifigures for the price, but it still falls over the $0.10 mark and is a larger set at $69.99 with fewer unique parts than expected.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></u></h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve read this review, don&#39;t get me wrong I like this set, I love just about all the Chima sets. I just feel this set is a bit below all of the other ones and is not necessary to get. The only reason I would recommend getting this set is for those who want the complete Chima collection, otherwise all the figures can be received in other more desirable sets that have their own unique minifigures and parts. However Chima sets overall are done very well. I just wouldn&#39;t have this one specifically high on my Chima list.</p>

<p>Overall: 3.33/5 pretty low, but the major misses are no unique figure for such a large set, and some model decisions I did not like. However it is still a decent set.</p>

<p>Another AFOL put this set together and it took him 4 hours.&nbsp; Normally he gets frustrated with complicated builds but this one didn&#39;t bother him, he though it was fun - mostly because the pieces were so different and easy to tell from one another.</p>

<p>Our 8 year old son could not wait for this to be put together so he could play with it.&nbsp; He loves being able to shoot the spears things, likes the way the mouth opens and closes and it fits in interestingly with some of his other set where they use boats to get around.</p>

<p>Really fun set!</p>
