Kids... I'm sure they'd much prefer just sticking the Chima figures on Spinners and letting them fight that way. Either way, let us review a Legends of Chima Speedorz.</p>
<p>First off I'll start by saying, the game, not sure I understand it completely. What it appears to be is a simple thing at first, then they have all these cards and there's some kind of rules to follow, I just think it's become a bit too complicated compared to the simple mechanics of Ninjago and the Spinners.</p>
<p>That being said, this is a buildable game which offers up a bit more than the flimsy little builds found on most Spinners. You get a solid actual model designed to fit in with the game, in this case there's a small ramp built up of a few pieces and then a very impressive looking model of a wolf's head, complete with hinged jaw to open and close as part of the game mechanics. This piece functions as intended, for the most part, you slide the huge Chi orb into the wolf's mouth, snap it shut then try and hit the target sticking up on top to tip it open and pop out the orb. Whoever does this first and grabs it get's to go first for the next phase of the game.</p>
<p>The wolf's head model looks great, and I could see some clever young MOCers incorporating it into some kind of Wolf Den or Palace build as a deadly trap for the other animal tribe members. The ramp and the Chi orb, not much you could do with them, unless you're really into the game.</p>
<p>Also included is of course the Speedor itself, a Speedor is a single wheeled rip-cord piece that, when you insert the rip-cord and pull back starts spinning. (I do not recommend putting this anywhere near a child's eye, in fact I strongly suggest that you be careful as this thing spins quite fast. Just pulling the cord once will ensure it goes flying off at super high speeds along any straight surface, such as a table.) The design is interesting I'll give LEGO that much, and haveing seen a few episodes I understand the basic idea of what they were going for with it, that being said it's still nowhere near as simple or elegant as a Spinner. If you aren't playing the game then it just sort of sits there on the shelf, leaning to one side, a sort of lobsided chariot for your Mini-Figures to ride on when displayed.</p>
<p>There are six pieces of Chi, or Chi crystals included and of course what everyone is buying this set for as it is the only way to get it, Skinnet the Skunk.</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure is pure love, the attention to detail, the amount of printing involved, the new tail piece that slides over the neck on a bracket. It is just brilliant. Skinnet is a black and white Skunk, with twig and vine armor on his chest and back, sharp looking claws on his toes and a purple tipped nose. (Both on his double-sided head printing and his brand new head piece.) I could go on and on about how great the print work is, how wonderful the figure looks, honestly though I'd just be repeating myself. If it is one thing that LEGO has done great with Legends of Chima (outside of the brilliant if somewhat quirky vehicle designs) it is the Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>As far as weapons go Skinnet does not have much to offer that is... unique, he's got the new brown whip piece we've seen with such Themes as Prince of Persia and he has a standard Castle Spear in dark brown with a small frond and blue Chi cylinder attached to it. (The included cards call this weapon the Stynkjahak, not sure I understand the naming convention of LoC weapons.)</p>
<p>Speaking of cards, the set has five, Skinnet's character card, the Stynkjahak card Toxismell, Gashuntor W4 and Whyp. These cards are part of the game I don't fully understand, however much like with the Ninjago Game cards included with the Spinner sets I am very impressed by their detail work and art. As a Collectible Card enthusiast I find them quite impressive and could see kids buying single packs of just the cards if LEGO were inclined to do something like that.</p>
<p>Overall, this is a pretty great looking set. There's a lot to offer here for fans of the Speedorz game, the model functions correctly and works well with the Speedors themselves, the Mini-Figure is unique and not available anywhere else and the only real flaw I can find in it honestly is the weapons he gets. I don't think they are as impressive as the other characters have recieved in the past. That being said, at the end of the day you're really only after this for the Mini-Figure if you're a fan of Legends of Chima Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>Kids will want it regardless, and it does seem to be a hot selling item as it is rarely seen on the shelves. While the model and piece count may be a bit low for the asking price of 19.99$ I'd still recommend this to fans of the Theme, the game or the Mini-Figures. I would advise you to try and get it on sale though.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,3
