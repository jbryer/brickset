The Legends Of Chima line suffers from many problems in my opinion. Compared to Ninjago (which had its fun moments, my kids enjoyed the show &amp; even I thought it had a cool plot), Chima suffers from a bad backstory. The semi-Yoda-wisdom and knowledge of Chi, Legend beasts and what have you, seems a bit too deep for younger children. Older kids might be scared off by the naive tone in the tv-show.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Which in itself is too bad since the detailing in all Chima minifigures and innovative design for vehicles excel and surpasses many other themes out there. I do believe the theme has potential and hopefully the tide will turn to save the theme before it gets discontinued. I'd love to see other tribes (tigers, bears, pelicans, elks, squirrels, elephants and so on) released in the future. Well, enough about my rant, what about THIS set?<div><br></div><h4>The set.</h4><div>It comes with one minifigure, gaming cards for the Chima game, chi crystals and a very much lion-like speedor - with a rip-cord. In addition there are a few weapon pieces with translucent blue pieces. Two cool items are the gold lightsaber handles, if you are a Star Wars fan. If you are into the game this all surely makes perfect sense. It also contains parts to build a tower to direct your speedor towards. Have you got what it takes to take down the blue ball from the top with the speedor? My daughter and I tried it and it is kind of tricky, not your easy bullseye homerun.</div><div><br></div><h4>Minifigure.</h4><div>Lagravis, the king of the lion-tribe, is absolutely amazing! He has lots of royal gold printing on torso and legs, very detailed and very cool. Most of the colouring apart from the lion-colour goes in blue and gold. The head piece is fantastic too, as always with these tribes. A head over the actual LEGO head, so to speak. To top it off, he sports a blue cloak to make it clear that he is the KING! It might be the cheapest way to get him at the moment, if you don't want to spend money on the Lion Chi Temple to get him.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Fantastic minifigure, top notch!</li><li>Generous ammount of extra pieces.</li><li>Nice colours.</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>A bit unmeaning unless you are into the game.</li></ul></div></div>",TRUE,2,2,2,4,2
