"LegoCam567","2013-06-29T07:54:51.487Z","Like Gorzan says: ""Dude, that set is awesome!""","<p class=""MsoNormal"">I must say, this set is really cool!<br>
<br>
Build: Of course, this is a speedorz set so you wonâ€™t be building anything
complex, but overall it's pretty easy and fun to do.<br>
<br>
Parts: There are actually many cool parts for such a small set, like the 6x4
green plates, the dark green Ben Ten tails, aqua/ turquoise plate with ring,
bananas, and what people may class as a ""BURP"" <br>
<br>
Figure: (Gorzan) The gorilla tribe is new for the summer, so the figure is
really great to have, especially a month early. The figure itself is extremely
detailed, and has leg, foot, torso, belt, and back printing. Then the head has
two faces; a relaxed and angry one. Then the mask piece for the gorilla is new
with lots of details. Overall, he is an awesome figure! He also includes a
simple hammer, and a larger brick built one with silver and trans-blue details.
Gorzan looks really awesome with his chi hammer! <br>
<br>
Speedor: Gorzan's speedor has the regular wheel/chasis peice, but with the new
gorilla cover piece. The cover is silver, and has blue, green and black details
on it to create a gorilla face. The attachment piece on the back uses the aqua
ring-plates and the bananas to create a cool and funny bonus to the vehicle.
His speedor also has a blue ripcord for it.<br>
<br>
Cards: There's not much to say about the cards. But they do have cool graphics
though. I like the way that Gorzan's character card has a yellow flower on the
road, which relates to episode 3 of Legends of Chima, if any of you have seen
it you will know what I mean.<br>
<br>
Structure: The brick built part of the set is basically a stone archway, which
has vines near the top. The vines also have spiked leaves on the end. Basic,
but cool for a small amount of pieces.<br>
<br>
Features/ Playability: With it being a speedor, it can ""drive"" as
always. It rolls quite smoothly though. The aim of the game is to spin the
vines on the archway, and get your speedor to ""drive"" through it,
dodging the leaves as it passes. It is quite similar to the windmill obstacle
in crazy golf, what with the spinning objects protecting the doorway. Quite
simple, but a good game to play. Then you of course have the playability of the
figure.<br>
<br>
Overall: This set is a really good set, whether you....<br>
<br>
1. Are collecting chima in some way 2. Would like a good, cheap set 3. Are
getting started with Chima/Lego 4. Need some good pieces 5. Want to buy a small
gift for somebody 6. Want a great set!<br>
<br>
Just a great set for the price, pieces, playability and end product! I would
recommend it to anyone! Thank you for reading this review, if you took the
time to read all of it, then please rate whether it was helpful or not. Thank
you! =D</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-09T17:09:27.087Z","Gorzan's Speedor Races Onto the Scene","<p><strong>Set #70109 Whirling Vines: </strong>Once again it&rsquo;s time to discuss the Speedorz sets of 2013. Specifically the first Gorilla Tribe Speedorz set featuring Gorzan. Here is Whirling Vines, is it a worth addition to your Speedorz collection? Read on and find out.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<p>The manual for this set is fairly straight forward, it is after all a Speedorz manual. Not much to the builds typically, and a lot of cross-promotional images used to boost the page count near the back of the book. Still they&rsquo;re a nice simple design that allow you to quickly build your chosen Speedorz traps and obstacles when playing the game, and there are no difficult steps in most Sppedorz sets.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Gorzan: Found in this Speedorz set is the leader of the Gorilla tribe. He&rsquo;s got an awesome print, which we&rsquo;ve seen before as it is different from the other Gorzan print wise from the polybag. He has a double-sided torso, a double-sided face, leg printing and a print covered head piece that looks awesome.</p>

<p>His accessories include the Dentmakor hammer (a common LEGO hammer tool from LEGO City) and the Chi Dentmakor, a brick-built chi powered hammer that is quite impressive looking. The design reminds me of the hammer found in Donkey Kong the classic arcade game, which considering that Gorzan the gorilla is wielding it is really funny to think about.</p>

<p>The Speedor</p>

<p>Doing something different for this review, changing up the way I review Speedorz. This Speedor is a nice looking one, the Gorilla tribe uses a new piece, as I believe I mentioned in the Grizzam Speedorz review. This one is a sculpted piece that has a gorilla face design in the front, the print is highly detailed and shows a gorilla face on either side with tech details, some leaf decorations and the gorilla tribe symbol on each trick.</p>

<p>This print is really sweet looking. The extra attachments give Gorzan more speed? Maybe, it&rsquo;s just his lunch, since you attach a few pieces that allow a pair of bananas it&rsquo;s a pretty weak attachment for a Gorilla Speedor, because honestly it doesn&rsquo;t serve much point. Unless you&rsquo;re trying to slip-up your opponent with peels.</p>

<p>The model &amp; Cards</p>

<p>The obstacle you get to build in this set uses some nice dark green constraction tail pieces to create a spinning vine trap. The object is to launch your speedor so it travels between the stone arch before the vine smashes into it. It&rsquo;s a nice obstacle, and works great as more than just a Speedor obstacle, it can easily stand in as a display piece for your Legends of Chima collection. Fair warning though, it uses two BURP pieces instead of making rock walls with bricks.</p>

<p>With this Speedor you have the Gorzan character card, the CHI Dentmakor weapon card, the Banana Boost card, Treehugger III card and Dentmakor weapon card. As usual the cards are great fun to collect, though the paper stock is starting to feel a bit thinner than the thick cards we got in some of the original sets.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>As Speedorz go this is a pretty solid set, it includes a great looking minifigure, some great accessories and a nice obstacle model for the Speedorz game. If you&rsquo;re interested in playing the Speedorz game, or collecting all of these fun little packs. I&rsquo;d recommend this because the gorilla tribe get&rsquo;s a lot of great looking Speedorz sets and builds.</p>
