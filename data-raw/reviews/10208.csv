Let&rsquo;s cover the pros and cons of this set.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Main model is fun and simple to build. Includes some nice dark green sloped pieces and sand brown sloped bricks.</li>
	<li>Grizzam Speedor looks impressive with transparent blue piece and some great printing.</li>
	<li>Includes Grizzam, Groundbreakor, Furiator, Treehuggor X and Jaba collectible cards.</li>
	<li>Grizzam Minifigure is great, white torso printed with a double-sided print, leg printing, double-sided facial print and white gorilla head piece.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Not many honestly, the most thing against this set is, like with all Speedorz the price per piece ratio, which honestly is a bit on the mismatched side.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>In my opinion I&rsquo;d say this is really one of the better Speedorz sets out there. Not only does it let you pick up Grizzam for your gorilla tribe collection on the cheap, but it features a more functional game setting for the challenges your Speedorz can face. The weapon included with Grizzam, his large hammer thing is a really great little weapon build and works great with the character. I strongly recommend this one folks.</p>
