<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Unique Minifigure for this set is a big selling point, the only fox minifigure in the Chima line, Furty. Features a great looking double-sided toros print, leg printing, a double-sided facial print, a unique fox head piece and a tail piece also found on Skinnet.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Includes Furty, Chi Whippa, Timboost, Huntor Foxari and Kutee collectible cards.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Furty&rsquo;s Speedor is built with Wolf Tribe top piece, in translucent orange and impressive looking print. Almost as if Furty stole broken parts off of wolf tribe Speedorz and used them to create his own.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Accessories are fairly weak compared to other Speedorz with a regular sai and a strange black whip thing that doesn&rsquo;t look much like a useful weapon.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Finished model in the set features very few pieces and suffers because of it, much like Boulder Bowling this model is very ungainly looking and suffers as unlike Crominus&rsquo; challenge it&rsquo;s missing a ramp.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Honestly, if you could get Furty by himself I&rsquo;d recommend just the minifigure from this set. The overall build for the challenge of this set is very minimal and the price per piece ratio here is atrocious. Mildly Recommended for completionists, collectible card lovers and fans of the fox minifig design. The rest of you could skip this one and just bricklink the minifig.</p>
