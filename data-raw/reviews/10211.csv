Battle of the Ages?","<p><strong>Set #70114 Sky Joust: </strong>It&rsquo;s a speedor battle pack with two members of the various tribes to duke it out, the price-per-piece ratio is a bit disappointing with this set. However it&rsquo;s not bad as far as speedorz sets go. I just wish it had more pieces considering it&rsquo;s a 25$ item with less than 100 pieces.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<p>The instructions for this Speedor set is smaller in scale than the ones found in the individual Speedorz sets. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they suffer, if anything they take up less space and yet still show you what you should be doing to build the model, speedorz and Minifigures in the set.</p>

<p>There seems to be a lot involved with the play side of the model, since the instructions for the game play portion of the set are pretty lengthy compared to the others, which makes sense as this is a two-pack of speedorz.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Two Minifigures included in this set.</p>

<p>Eris: While her printing is unchanged from other sets in 2013 this Minifigure is considered unique to this set because of the lack of Chi on her golden armour piece. Her accessories include the Axcalibur and the other is meant to be the Stabiku, a Lightsaber hilted blade, the odd thing is that while the cards show her with this weapon the instructions have you give it to Rawzom. Really curious that.</p>

<p>Rawzom: A rare Minifigure found in few cheap sets, Rawzom is one of the high members of the raven tribe, I believe leader over Razar. He&rsquo;s got an impressive level of detail with double-sided torso printing, leg printing, a double-sided face and the awe inspiring printing on the raven head piece. He only has silver armour in this set, but if you&rsquo;re looking to get this character cheaply than you definitely want this.</p>

<p>Weapons include the Thugk staff and the Jagonk chain weapon, which again, the images on the card clearly indicate he&rsquo;s meant to have this weapon, but the instructions say Eris is meant to use it. I&rsquo;m not sure if LEGO originally wanted these weapons this way, or if it&rsquo;s just a case of earlier instructions being used for the weapon assignment.</p>

<p>The Speedor</p>

<p>Both of these speedorz are using the same top piece, because they are both part of the winged tribes. The print on Eris&rsquo; speedor is fairly detailed and captures the likeness of an eagle&rsquo;s face brilliantly. Her speedor add-on piece seems to be a pair of gold Lightsaber hilts with studs on them, it isn&rsquo;t much, pretty negligible honestly.</p>

<p>Rawzom&rsquo;s speedor has a great looking print on the sides too, including the raven tribe symbol on both sides. It&rsquo;s an extension of the raven tribe&rsquo;s mechanical add-on/replacement limbs idea with a metallic looking armour made out of plates and riveted together. His add-on is a simple looking miniature rocket engine, to boost his speed to insane levels I&rsquo;d wager, not sure how he can control it when it&rsquo;s blasting down the track.</p>

<p>The Model &amp; Cards</p>

<p>The model for this game is a pair of colour coded ramps for each tribe, which aren&rsquo;t much to look at, and a fancy pedestal with a Chi crystal on top loosely kept in place on a transparent blue radar dish. The object is to launch the speedor at the ramp to have it knock the crystal over to win a chance at claiming the Chi. It isn&rsquo;t much to look at really and the piece count in this set is fairly unimpressive considering the price point, still it is a functional model and can stand in anywhere for your LEGO Legends of Chima display.</p>

<p>You get ten cards in this set, Rawzom and Eris character cards, Thugk, Stabiku, Jagonk and Axcalibur weapon cards and the Blazoom, Kleptor S2, Badaboost and Shreekor 375 speedor boosting and chariot cards. These cards are on a thinner stock of cardboard/paper this time around, which means they&rsquo;re easier to bend if you don&rsquo;t protect them.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a great way to get the Rawzom character, it&rsquo;s just a shame that the price of the set is a bit high for what you get. The model is so small that I expected this to actually be priced a bit lower honestly. If you can still find this anywhere on clearance I&rsquo;d suggest picking it up, it&rsquo;s not a bad set, just not a lot for your dollar if paying full price on it.</p>
