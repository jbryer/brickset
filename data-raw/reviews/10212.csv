<h3>Box</h3>

<p>The Package was very standard, as it was a bag, introduced to this system of building for the Breakout wave of Hero Factory.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The amount and selection of parts is very good as it has at least five exclusive ones.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build doesn&#39;t take to long, which is convenient since most of the time you want to play with it, but it is long enough to please those who enjoy building more than playing like collectors.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is about the size of 6202 Rocka&nbsp;and can be incorporated into play very well as it can be used when you have your&nbsp;Laval Minifigure CHI&#39;s-Up..</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Here are my pros. and cons.</p>

<p>Pros.</p>

<p>- A bunch of exclusive parts</p>

<p>- A way to store the shield on the figure&#39;s back</p>

<p>- Very poseable</p>

<p>Cons.</p>

<p>- Could&#39;ve stood a few more bricks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall Rating:</p>

<p>4.6 of 5&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
