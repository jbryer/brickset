This time we&rsquo;ll be reviewing the only female member to be made into a buildable action figure, and I&rsquo;m surprised to say that this one is slightly weaker than the previous two due to one glaring issue. Her wings. But we&rsquo;ll get to that when we discuss the figure. Read on to find out if this set is worth tracking down.</p>

<p>Packaging/Instructions</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t much to discuss by now about the packaging if you&rsquo;ve read my other reviews. LEGO made an interesting choice to use this style, it works well. Something I may not have mentioned yet is the fact that each packaging shows the two sets required to build a combined model. You can take Eris and Laval and merge them, although the instructions for these are only found online.</p>

<p>Speaking of instructions, this manual feels the thickest out of all the sets I&rsquo;ve reviewed so far. Perhaps there are more steps to them, who can say. I do know for a fact that the cross promotional images are still the same as ever. LEGO instructions never disappoint though, you can always follow the steps easily and never have too much difficulty in figuring out what to do next.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>Eris&rsquo; basic body build is fairly similar to Worriz and some steps in the Gorzan build, the basic skeleton is built pretty much the same way. The only difference is when you start attaching the armour and other bits to make each figure unique. Her build is fast and not too complex, similar to most constraction figures.</p>

<p>It is when you get to the wings that you begin to feel a bit of a downer. I am a huge fan of these once I started picking them up I was thrilled at the level of ingenuity used in their construction. Larger buildable figures similar to the old Bionicle design, but using new pieces and new parts. It was great. Sadly LEGO did not give her near enough attention for proper wings, they look more like extra arms on her back, sort of like a General Grievous design. And it&rsquo;s mostly due to the fact that they use standard LEGO wing pieces instead of inventing a new piece to interact more solidly with this build style. They are as poseable as they need to be in the build, and it&rsquo;s pretty solid, but the feathers do a very bad job of looking like actual wings. Which brings us on to the completed model.</p>

<p>The Constraction Figure</p>

<p>I like Eris, in spite of her flaws her design can&rsquo;t be faulted too much. Her weapon is a really hefty looking CHI battle axe with two massive blades, these pieces look more like wings than her actual wings though, which makes me question why LEGO chose not to indulge in such a piece for their design.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of how masculine she looks. Her basic torso design is the same one found on everyone, excluding Gorzan, and it just isn&rsquo;t feminine enough for my liking. Admittedly I&rsquo;m not expecting some kind of curvy, busty thing, but as action figures go male and female body types are usually pretty distinct. It held her design more if she stood out more against her fellow CHI Constraction figures, you could mistake her for Ewar or another Eagle Tribe member considering her sculpt doesn&rsquo;t differentiate her enough.</p>

<p>The wings are a huge let down as well. Especially when LEGO has so many other options at their disposal for including proper wings. The feather pieces are too small compared to her body frame, they barely look as if they could lift her off the ground, let alone actually sustain lengthy periods of flight.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion</p>

<p>If like me you are actually a fan of these different play patterns in LEGO I can strongly recommend this set. Especially as there is plenty of options for making improvements to a slightly disappointing model, especially as I can see many fans figuring out a much better design for her wings.</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t hold much interest in sets lacking in Minifigures or tons of play features I&rsquo;d suggest skipping out on this sub-line. Once built they don&rsquo;t actually offer much else to do, unless you enjoy playing with action figures and having them battle one another. It&rsquo;s nice that the chest armour is printed though instead of a sticker like with Gorzan. In the end, while she is one of my favorites, she does have some flaws and I think this sub-line would appeal more to people who enjoy building model kit figures and stuff. As there is no means of interacting with Minifigures, and no place to put any, I don&rsquo;t know what more to say.</p>
