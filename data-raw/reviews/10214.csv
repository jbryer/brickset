<p>Packaging/Instructions</p>

<p>These resealable envelopes are decent for returning the figure into a bag for storage, they&rsquo;re a lot more practical than the old Bionicle bins because they don&rsquo;t take up nearly as much space and can be collapsed when they are empty. They won&rsquo;t take up much space on the shelf, the only downside of this type of packaging is that it is damaged when you open it. The top of the package needs to be cut open, so you&rsquo;re losing some of the print and images on the package.</p>

<p>The instructions are really short, just as I mentioned before. They&rsquo;re also straight forward when it comes to the build, these figures don&rsquo;t involve too many steps, but it would be nice to see a fun image or two, maybe even a little story in comic form in the back just to give something more to talk about. The action shots in the back for these figures is still pretty impressive though.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>As I said before this is a unique build compared to Worriz. While the basic skeleton build is similar, the use of many unique parts and steps make Gorzan look and feel much different as you&rsquo;re building him. Building the torso and upper body is really interesting, it bulks up the character quite nicely and captures the likeness of a gorilla. It also uses a different torso piece compared to any of the other Chima Constraction figures.</p>

<p>The Constraction Figure</p>

<p>Gorzan in his powered up Chi form is a bruiser. He&rsquo;s got shorter legs and longer arms than Worriz, and as I mentioned before his upper body is very bulky. It includes a decent print on the sticker you&rsquo;re meant to apply to it. Yeah, I haven&rsquo;t built this in a while, forgot that he actually has stickers and not printed details. You&rsquo;d think for a set this small they could just go with printed detailing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the hands, the build for the hands isn&rsquo;t terrible, but where they attach to the arms just destroys the poseability. In fact that&rsquo;s a point against this figure, a lot of the build winds up hindering the poses you can do with him, mostly because of the placement of the armour pieces, or the fact that his hands attach on the second balljoint instead of the one you&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;s meant to use. I guess it&rsquo;s meant to shorter his arms just slightly, but it means you can have him turn his hands or pretend to make fists. The reason why he can&rsquo;t do this? Because one of his hands has to have space for the piece being used to hold his weapon.</p>

<p>And what a weapon. He&rsquo;s given a massive mace with a long handle so he can club his opponents. The spiked club pieces I think were used before with the Green Lantern Constraction figure.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion</p>

<p>I am really a fan of this style of build. Not all of them can achieve as dynamic a pose as I might like, Gorzan for example can&rsquo;t make a traditional gorilla stance because his thick chest plate blocks his arms from moving into the correct position. But I&rsquo;d still say they&rsquo;re a decent play and build style that LEGO has perfected since the days of Bionicle collecting. I&rsquo;m a huge fan of them and recommend these figures, if you&rsquo;re into them. If you prefer bricks and buildings and Minifigures, you&rsquo;ll probably want to skip these sets.</p>
