I&rsquo;m really impressed with this and I&rsquo;ll explain why during this review. One thing&rsquo;s for sure, it&rsquo;s a shame the second batch of Constraction Figures never seemed to make it to Canada. Oh well, on with the review!</p>

<p>Packaging/Instructions</p>

<p>Please see my previous reviews for more detail discussion of the packaging, these special foil envelopes, or whatever you&rsquo;d call them, are really great for storage and stand out very strongly on the shelf. Unfortunately the Constraction figures seem to have been a slow sell to the fans, probably because they don&rsquo;t include Minifigures.</p>

<p>The instructions do their job well of making the model build easy to follow and the cross-promotional images are strong. As these were made during the early days of Legends of Chima that is to be expected.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>This is a really fun build, you can really appreciate the techniques used in this style of build here as you go from the legs up to the torso. It&rsquo;s a very solid build too without as many gaps as some of the others have in certain areas such as the torso. However the neck area does have a large opening.</p>

<p>The weapon build is fairly impressive, the large bladed weapons I really dig and the head alone is an impressive use of newly sculpted constraction pieces for Cragger. I have had tons of fun with that head just alone.</p>

<p>The Constraction Figure</p>

<p>Cragger here is a solid looking figure. He&rsquo;s similar to Worriz in that he&rsquo;s very lanky, much different from Gorzan or even Eris. The chest armour is really impressive, the level of poseability is just awesome. You can have him strike many poses, and the tail doesn&rsquo;t get in the way, the weapon unfortunately limits his arms while he&rsquo;s holding it. If you wanted to free up the arms you could probably modify the weapon to fit in one hand, you might need a few extra Technic pieces for the weapon.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion</p>

<p>Awesome figure, he&rsquo;s extremely poseable once finished, you can have him strike many dynamic looking poses. And on top of that this one can actually interact with Minifigures, his jaw opens and closes and is able to just bite down on Chima minifigs. I&rsquo;ve had hours of fun alone just opening and closing the jaw and move the head from side to side. Definitely recommended for fans of this style of build.</p>

The face looks incredible and the model itself truly looks like an upright, anthropomorphic crocodile. My&nbsp;gripes with the design are that the tail is too thin, the feet look like one of a bird and that the hands are always closed. I unfortunately lost the big stick that Cragger holds, making&nbsp;the unoccupied hand look&nbsp;strange. The weird foot makes the figure tilt. Otherwise, this figurine looks great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the building process, I gave 4. As much as I loved building this set, it was hard for me to put the pieces on the articulations. I believe this is just a &quot;me thing&quot;, but if you have difficulties assembling pieces with articulations then maybe this set is not for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For playability, I put 3 because the articulations are pretty stiff. It&#39;s hard to pose the character the way you want, especially with all those plates in the way. The character is also pretty heavy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for money is 4 because price per piece is a bit overpriced, but even then, I think retail price is great.</p>
