This is my first time reviewing one of these and I decided to change up the reviewing style. It&rsquo;s important to discuss everything about these sets, so we&rsquo;re going into this in as much detail as is possible.</p>

<p>Packaging/Instructions</p>

<p>They come in large resealable pouches similar to ziplock bags, but not entirely. The images and artwork on the front and back are pretty decent. You get a good feel for what to expect from this set, and you can also see that if you combine it with other sets from the wave you can make larger figures. Combine Worriz and Cragger to make a much more powerful version of Worriz.</p>

<p>The instructions are really short, they show you the steps to build the main model, and there are some cross-promotional images in the back for the rest of the line.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>These are fast and fun little builds. Using the basic techniques introduced with Hero Factory, the Constraction style of play relies more on snapping balljoints together and attaching extra pieces of armour, using technic pieces for the weaponry. This build is pretty impressive actually, true it is repetitive for most of the build, but ultimately you&rsquo;ll enjoy it if this play style agrees with you.</p>

<p>The Constraction Figure</p>

<p>CHI Worriz is a powerful looking figure, while you can&rsquo;t incorporate standard LEGO bricks or pieces of that sort into this style of build, the models really pop and stand out. It&rsquo;s also nice that LEGO incorporated them into the Chima cartoon, showing that these are their powered up forms when using Chi.</p>

<p>The simple printing detail on the chest panel showing the power of Chi flowing through his body and the impressive choice of builds for the two weapons he uses make Worriz a solid Constraction figure. I love the way they did the hands too, using the standard LEGO droid arms first seen in Exo-Force and snapping them onto large fist-like armour pieces to make the hands. It works. I prefer this style of build to the older Bionicle builds mainly because these figures look and feel like buildable action figures should, without relying on gimmicks that hinder the mobility of the numerous ball and socket joints.</p>

<p>The sculpted head piece and all the detailing it is also really, really impressive and I&rsquo;m surprised that Constraction Chima figures lingered so long on the shelves that the second wave never showed up in Canada.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion</p>

<p>Personally I would highly recommend this set on the merits of its build alone and its playability. This is the type of figure I expect from LEGO when they start making buildable action figures, not the old school Galidor junk they first started out with. Incorporating this style into the new Bionicle series was sheer genius and I look forward to picking them up. In the meantime, CHI Worriz is a great looking figure, and while it doesn&rsquo;t interact fully in the traditional sense when it comes to standard LEGO bricks, it&rsquo;s definitely a worthy addition to the LEGO brand name and play style.</p>
