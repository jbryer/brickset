"Ernst","2013-06-01T12:40:28.673Z","The Wizard Battle; a good (must have) set but overpriced.","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks</strong>: The &quot;cheapest&quot; set of the second wave of the LOTR sets is a very good set and looking at the content a must have for the LOTR fans. A great content concerning the parts, the mini figures and&nbsp;a great&nbsp;result when finished building. Normally this would give a 5 brick result but I distracted one for the price. Retail price here is &euro;17,99 which I consider way to much for a 113 parts set, it results in a price per piece in Holland of &euro;0,16.</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks</strong>: Building is fun and not too difficult, you start with the building of the Wizard&#39;s stage with underneath it the mechanism to move Saruman&#39;s Cristall sphere with Sauron&#39;s eye in it on a turntable. After that Saruman&#39;s throne with a &quot;launching&quot; mechanism. On both sides of the throne a&nbsp;great looking yellow lantern. Nothing&nbsp;spectacular but simply good so 4 bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong>: The parts used in this set are great starting of course with the 2 great minifigures Gandalf the Grey and Saruman the White. All other parts are very useful with an extra remark for the 2 <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=30106&amp;idColor=19#T=P&amp;C=19"">trans yellow globes</a> and of course <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=3626cpb0935&amp;idColor=18#T=P&amp;C=18"">Sauron&#39;s eye. </a>One thing I don&#39;t like is Sauron&#39;s rubber beard/hairpiece, better should have been 2 plastic parts in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>; This set offers the opportunity to replay the scene in the movie with al its ingredients. You can also very easily integrate it in all your other LOTR or Castle sets, so 5&nbsp;highly deserved bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks</strong>: Like said before this is simply way overpriced but since at has good content and it is the cheapest set of the second wave of LOTR sets it will be sold well. I think a price like in the US of &euro;12,00 would have been more reasonable, I think if you are patient the price will lower&nbsp;a bit.</p>

"Almaras","2013-06-16T00:36:52.243Z","""A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.""","<p><font size=""4"">The Wizard Battle is a fantastic small set! Right from the start, the box feels weighty and is full to the brim with bricks. The bags don’t rattle around in a half empty box, and neither does the instruction manual – which decreases the likelihood of opening a box to find bent pages. It also gives the feeling of getting value for money.</font></p><font size=""4""><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The two minifigures included in this set are superb. Gandalf comes with his usual detailed torso that has both front and back printing to include the folds of his robes and his belt, and a double sided head, with a stern face and an angry face. As his beard covers his mouth, all that changes are his eyebrows and the deepness of his scowl. His usual hat has been replaced by a more than welcome hairpiece, which is only slightly let down by the gap it leaves between it and the beard. Although Gandalf is a common figure, he really is a great figure and can easily be parted out for medieval MOCs if you so wish. He is accompanied by our first appearance of Saruman in all his evil glory. Notably missing from the first wave, Saruman is a minifigure that is well worth the wait! His torso has fantastic double sided printing with silver detailing that really pops – it seemed a shame to cover it up by putting his cape and beard on, but enough still shows to give an impression of Saruman’s robes. His face is surprisingly detailed, considering that most of it is covered by the hair/beard piece. Like Gandalf, Saruman has two faces that you can alternate to further furrow his brow, both sides with detailed mouth and facial hair printing. The main highlight, for me, is the hair and beard piece. Although I am usually somewhat reserved when it comes to rubber pieces, this piece has won me over. It is a high quality rubber that feels strong and fits snuggly, and fixes that gap-between-hair-and-beard problem that always bugs me. The light and dark grey printing for the beard is enough for me to forgive the crumpling of the cape. Lastly, I am quite impressed by the three-piece staff that Saruman carries – it is a nice change from the standard staff carried by Gandalf.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The solid feeling of the box continues into the build. For a small set, I was surprised by the length of the build and the details that went into it. The finished model was bigger than I was expecting and has a great ominous feel to it. Saruman’s throne is wonderfully dark and evil, making use of plenty of sloped pieces to achieve its effect. Using sloped pieces also allows Saruman’s cape to fit down the back of the chair, meaning that he can sit without crumpling it, and he can actually sit flat without it pushing him up. Despite this pro, I still removed the flat 2x2 tile so that I could make Saruman sit properly, as I found he kept slipping whenever I moved the set, particularly when I tried positioning him holding his staff. The play feature for the throne flings Saruman from his seat, and while it works well, as Saruman is still in a seated position, he just kind of rolls away. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second play feature is much more effective and also contains my favourite piece for the set: The minifigure head with the eye of Sauron printed on. I imagine this piece will be a selling point for many, and it does not disappoint. It is a great addition to the set, the eye transitions wonderfully into a Lego piece. The eye is enhanced by the globe that goes over the top of it, forming the palantir. The knob at the back of the set turns the palantir, and the round plate it sits on. The back of the box shows how Gandalf’s legs can be attached to the plate so that Saruman can spin him around, recreating that memorable scene from the Fellowship of the Ring. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Other detailing includes the two tall lamps and the steps leading up to the platform, which round the set of nicely. The finished model feels sturdy enough and gives a great insight to the styling that [hopefully] flows into Orthanc. For a small set, it brings a lot of detail into a satisfying build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><p>(I should also note that although there is a brick lifter alongside the set in the official images, my set does not contain a brick lifter and a brick lifter does not appear in the parts list at the end of the manual. I did find it odd that there would be one in such a small set.)</p></font>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

<p>This is a set which has divided opinion from the moment it was announced. <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79005-1"">79005</a> The Wizard Battle is a nice set on its own, no doubt about that, but the main source of complaint has generally been the fact that this model is almost identical to the third floor of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10237-1"">10237</a> Tower of Orthanc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nobody can deny the fact that this set is very similar to Saruman&#39;s&nbsp;throne&nbsp;room in the Tower of Orthanc set, but&nbsp;I would argue that this set is well worth purchasing nevertheless at &pound;11.99 or $12.99 for 113-pieces. Obviously if you cannot afford&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10237-1"">10237</a> Tower of Orthanc, or cannot justify the cost of the set,&nbsp;then this model is going to be a winner, but there is a single piece which might well draw in even owners of the larger model. You can probably guess which one I am talking about already...</p>

<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>LEGO has recently introduced smaller boxes in an attempt to save packaging and this set is no exception to the new rule. On the front of the box are Gandalf and Saruman in the midst of their epic duel, while the eye of Sauron stares out from the&nbsp;Palant&iacute;r which sits in pride of place in the very centre of the box. The malevolent Sauron also glares from the border of the box along the top, just like the other Lord of the Rings sets from 2013.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9440361646/"" title=""79005 The Wizard Battle by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79005 The Wizard Battle"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7405/9440361646_915f2f36f2_n.jpg"" style=""height:269px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The back of the box shows the set from another perspective and demonstrates the features of the model, as well as a couple of cinematic shots of the Minifigures. The instructions are folded inside and there are two small bags, which are not numbered of course,&nbsp;as one would expect of such a small set. Two dark bluish grey 2 x 14 plates are packaged loose within the box and there are no stickers.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Two Minifigures are included, one of whom is all too common, although this is a slight variation on the usual Minifigure, while the other will doubtless prove very popular indeed.</p>

<p>The duller of the two in my opinion is <strong>Gandalf the Grey</strong>, who has appeared in five&nbsp;other sets (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9469-1"">9469</a>, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=10237-1"">10237</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=30213-1"">30213</a>, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=79003-1"">79003</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=79010-1"">79010</a>). This Minifigure is technically unique to this set, although only due to the lack of a cape and hat. Without his hat of course, Gandalf has a&nbsp;long grey hairpiece, which has been around for many years now. Unfortunately his hair and beard do not quite link up as they should, but the piece is quite accurate nonetheless.&nbsp;His head is the same as the&nbsp;Gandalf Minifigure in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10237-1"">10237</a>, with one smiling face and one angry expression, along with bushy grey eyebrows and a few wrinkles printed on both sides. His beard was moulded specifically for this character and is highly detailed with texturing and impressive accuracy.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9440357580/"" title=""79005 The Wizard Battle by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79005 The Wizard Battle"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5328/9440357580_381f5c6ef8_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:283px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso is the same as always too, with various pouches and a brown belt printed on the front and back, although much of this design is obscured by the beard. His legs are plain dark bluish grey and he carries a reddish brown staff to represent the one he uses in the film. If this is your first Gandalf Minifigure, then he is rather nice, although a hat and cape would be welcome. However, if you have been collecting the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit sets so far, then you will doubtless have a few of this Minifigure already.</p>

<p>By far the more interesting for me of the two Minifigures included is the wizard&nbsp;<strong>Saruman the White</strong>, who reveals in this scene that he is now loyal to Sauron. Starting from the top, his combined hair and beard piece is fantastic. It is mostly white, but is printed with light and dark shades of grey on the beard area, just like in the film. The piece is slightly rubbery and moulded with some nice hair texture. Interestingly, his head is identical to the one of Count Dooku in the Star Wars set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=75017-1"">75017</a> Duel on Geonosis with a huge amount of detail including a white beard, black eyebrows and some tiny wrinkles. The use of the same piece makes perfect sense of course as both characters are played by the same magnificent actor, Christopher Lee. Two expressions are printed on the head, one serious and the other smiling slyly. Saruman wears a simple white cape which looks suitably luxurious.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9440355802/"" title=""79005 The Wizard Battle by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79005 The Wizard Battle"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3808/9440355802_d700a29f19_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:279px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso is printed with a lot of detail, including silver scrollwork and some creases in his white jacket. The back, despite being covered by the cape, is also printed with some more of the jacket and folds in the fabric. The legs are plain white and he carries a staff made up of three pieces which resembles the film prop reasonably well. This is a fantastic Minifigure and if you do not plan to purchase <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10237-1"">10237</a> Tower of Orthanc, this set is well worth purchasing for this figure alone in my opinion.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>This is a small set, so not much can be expected from the build, which takes about ten minutes. There are no interesting building techniques as far as I can see, although some may be interested in the use of a crystal ball piece which distorts the eye of Sauron inside giving it a rather mystical quality. If this use for the crystal ball piece is new to you, then it is well worth remembering!</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>Needless to say the model itself is not hugely exciting, consisting basically of a throne for Saruman, two light fixtures and the&nbsp;Palant&iacute;r on its stand. There are a couple of features included which are nice, the first of which is on the throne itself. Saruman can be launched from his seat using a button behind the throne to recreate the moment he launches himself at Gandalf during this scene in the film. When Saruman is seated, it is worth noting that a gap has been included to cater for his cape, which does not need to be removed or folded up when he sits down.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9437568575/"" title=""79005 The Wizard Battle by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79005 The Wizard Battle"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3781/9437568575_538c3eedb4_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:313px"" /></a></p>

<p>There are a couple of steps on either side of the model and two lamps which represent those used inside the Tower of Orthanc in the films. The highlight for me however, as you might have imagined, is the eye of Sauron printed piece which is contained within the&nbsp;Palant&iacute;r. This can be rotated using a knob on the back of the model and one can even recreate Gandalf being spun around by Saruman by using the turntable piece which makes the eye spin.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9440348906/"" title=""79005 The Wizard Battle by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79005 The Wizard Battle"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2884/9440348906_f9755e7289_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:317px"" /></a></p>

<p>The eye itself is printed on a translucent orange Minifigure head component and looks fantastic. To me it begs to be used in a microscale&nbsp;Barad-d&ucirc;r but it works equally well as a Minifigure accessory.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9437570123/"" title=""79005 The Wizard Battle by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79005 The Wizard Battle"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5484/9437570123_4dd78bcbcb_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:314px"" /></a></p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>If you own (or plan to buy) <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10237-1"">10237</a> Tower of Orthanc, then this is a set which you can certainly pass&nbsp;on. However, if you think that this set is worth it for the eye of Sauron alone, then naturally it is well worth having. For those of you who have no intention to purchase <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10237-1"">10237</a> Tower of Orthanc on the other hand, this is an excellent set. An affordable way of getting Saruman is very welcome and the model itself is not bad at all.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9437560477/"" title=""79005 The Wizard Battle by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79005 The Wizard Battle"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3762/9437560477_bc09ab2e24_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:279px"" /></a></p>

<p>Even so, as I have said again and again, I think the eye of Sauron is the highlight. Even if you do own the Tower of Orthanc set, make sure at the very least to lay your hands on the eye of Sauron which is of course notably absent from the larger set (although the very different Palant&iacute;r in that set is excellent too).</p>

<p>Parts: <strong>4</strong> - There are some useful black and dark grey pieces, but the best piece needless to say is the eye of Sauron itself.</p>

<p>Playability: <strong>4.5</strong> - A couple of features are bound to be entertaining and with these two Minifigures, one can easily recreate the dueling scene as the name of the set would suggest. A lot of playability&nbsp;for the price.</p>

<p>Building Experience: <strong>3</strong> - Nothing more nor less than what one might expect from a set at&nbsp;this price point.</p>

<p>Value for Money: <strong>4</strong> - It is great to see Saruman in such an inexpensive set, and it certainly feels as though you get your money&#39;s worth.</p>

<p>Overall: <strong>4</strong>&nbsp;- For those of you who&nbsp;own <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10237-1"">10237</a>, this set can be skipped, if you do not, an excellent little set really.</p>

"tkettle9719","2013-08-10T21:37:25.483Z","Lord of the Rings: 79005: The Wizard Battle REVIEW","<p>I got this set about a week ago from LegoShop.com, mainly for the Saruman minifigure and the Palantir piece with the Eye of Sauron printed on it. Although those are probably the two best things about this set (let's be honest here), this set has so much more going for it than those two things. This is truly a masterpiece set, something that I believe will be essential set (unless you have the Tower of Orthanc, which I don't).<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>There are great pieces in here; most of them are rather ordinary (although they are great for MOCs), but the standout pieces here are the hair/beard piece of Saruman and the inside Palantir piece. <br></li><li>These two wizards look terrific; although this is my third Gandalf, the addition of the hair is a very nice touch, and the printing on Saruman's body's top half is impeccably perfect. <br></li><li>The actual set is very character-oriented, but the steps here are very much welcome, as are the torches and the throne of Saruman, which are beautifully made; even the place for the cape is welcome, although awkward-looking. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The spinning feature for the Palantir is a welcome addition, although I will say that it is slightly difficult to rotate it. This may just be mine, but it doesn't work as seamlessly as I'd like it to. <br></li><li>As I said before, the throne of Saruman is wonderful, but the place where his cape goes, although useful and maybe a very smart thing to put, looks awkward from an angle. <br></li><li>My final con is that Saruman is loosely placed on the throne; there are only flat tiles for him to sit on, which sort of disappoints me. It would be just as easy to fit him onto a brick and have the launching axle; in fact, it would look better. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is an excellent intro set to the second wave of LoTR sets, and it has some excellent parts. Overall, this set really hits all the good spots on my list, and is very accurate. If you have the Tower of Orthanc, you could probably pass off on this set just because this room is featured closely in that set. If not, this is a must-buy, especially if you only want this set for the Palantir piece. That alone makes the set worth it. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Telcontar","2013-06-16T19:12:54.31Z","""When did Saruman the wise abandon reason for madness!?""","<p>This set is the smallest of&nbsp;the fantastic new wave of Lord of the Rings sets this year [2013].&nbsp; Even though&nbsp;it only comes with 113 pieces it&nbsp;is definitely worth it...&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>The box is a small square, tightly packed with&nbsp;a single bag of pieces.&nbsp; Two 2x14 dark grey plates are loose as well as the folded instruction manual.&nbsp; The instructions are nicely printed and easy to follow like always.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>The parts selection in this sets consists mostly of grey and black with plenty of bricks and quite a few slopes.&nbsp; There are a few neat pieces that are worth specifically mentioning like the printed head piece that makes up&nbsp;the inside of the palantir.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a translucent orange with&nbsp;The Eye printed on the front and back.&nbsp;&nbsp;The clear &quot;globe&quot; piece around it magnifies the design and it looks quite cool.&nbsp; The same &quot;globe&quot; piece that covers the palantir also comes in yellow for the lights beside Saruman&#39;s chair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will note here that the sets does <em>not </em>come with a brick separator.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s pictured&nbsp;like that here on Brickset, but it&#39;s not accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Extra Note: I checked the instruction manual and there isn&#39;t one listed in the parts list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p><strong>Gandalf the Grey: </strong>This guy is technically exclusive for a&nbsp;few weeks before&nbsp;Orthanc&nbsp;comes out because&nbsp;this is the first time we see him without his hat and he comes with a double head (angry and focused).&nbsp;&nbsp;The hair piece is (unfortunately)&nbsp;recycled from Harry Potter sets (I believe).&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks incredibly accurate and overall a great minifig.&nbsp; If I get really picky I could complain about the simplicity of his staff.</p>

<p><strong>Saruman the White: </strong>This is probably one of my&nbsp;favorite LotR minifigs yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all his beard piece is incredible.&nbsp; When&nbsp;you compare it side by side to&nbsp;Christopher Lee in the film&nbsp;is looks like a miniature copy of him.&nbsp; The shape, angles, color changes, etc.&nbsp; Very Well Done LEGO!&nbsp; His head his double sided as well (stern/focused and angry).&nbsp; The torso is incredibly detailed&nbsp;as well and includes some back printing behind his white cape which is actually somewhat rare.&nbsp; His staff is a bit better than his &quot;friend&#39;s&quot; with a few pieces on top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>The build is quite enjoyable for a $13 set. There&#39;s just the slightest bit of technic involved in some of the &quot;play features&quot; and really really little kids could get confused by some of the sloped pieces. Overall a great build for a set of it&#39;s size.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>The finished model looks great and feels quite substantial for $13, even though it is a bit overpriced.&nbsp; I love the use of the slopes to make Saruman&#39;s chair and the missile pieces as the lamp posts. A note about the chair: When most LEGO guys with capes try to sit down the cloth gets bent, but not with this one.&nbsp; The way the slopes are used a nice thin crack is built with houses Saruman&#39;s cloak quite nicely.&nbsp; It&#39;s really an ingenious way of doing it and it looks fantastic too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier there are two main play features in this set.&nbsp; This first is an axle in Saruman&#39;s chair that you can use to launch him out to attack Gandalf.&nbsp; This works some of the time,&nbsp;but because the cape&nbsp;is where it is it makes it harder for the feature to work properly.&nbsp; The second&nbsp;is a&nbsp;simple series of axles and gears underneath the model that&nbsp;you can use to make the palantir spin around.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can attach Gandalf by the legs onto its [the palantir&#39;s] base and spin him around like the the film which is quite amusing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>Overall this is a great little set.&nbsp; Nice assortment of pieces (if you&#39;re in the need for greys and blacks), fantastic minifigs, and tons of playability.&nbsp; If I could change anything it would be the price.&nbsp; $13 is a little much.&nbsp; $10 or $11 would have been better.&nbsp; But it&#39;s not really that much of a difference.&nbsp; I probably wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;recommend it for LEGO fans younger than 9 (just because they probably wouldn&#39;t care for LotR), but for anyone older I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to get it.</p>

Out of the 4 retail sets from this year this one has the best value as far as the price is concerned mostly due to the inclusion of Saruman. Let's go over quickly the pros and cons of this set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Saruman the White is included in this set without his sloped robe brick from Tower of Orthanc, this means that you have a cheap alternative if you're only after the Mini-Figure. (Though why deny yourself the sheer majesty that is Orthanc I'm not sure.) 
<li>Sauron's Eye is included as a printed Mini-Figure head for the Pallantir effect, it's a pretty nifty print and very welcome as part of the play feature of the set. 
<li>This is the only Gandalf so far that doesn't come with his hat, which makes him unique and at least isn't as bland as most other sets with Gandalf. Still it is Gandalf. 
<li>The model builds Saruman's Throne with a few lamps beside them, the main reason I'm listing this as a Pro is that the build of the throne accomodates space for Saruman's cape. This is just a great clever little idea that means Saruman can sit and his cape won't crease or eventually conform to the shape of the throne.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>This is a pretty pointless set to buy if you're planning on getting Tower of Orthanc. Unless you happen to be a completist and want 100% completion of your LEGO LotR collection this set is more for the younger fans who can't afford the larger exclusive set. 
<li>The model is great, unfortunately I don't believe you can fit it inside Orthanc, so if you are a completist and planning on buying both you're going to have a loose Throne of Saruman somewhere. 
<li>Saruman's Wizard staff looks great, unfortunately I have issues with the build of the staff because the white piece on top just loves to fall off. It doesn't stay in place tightly so it's easy to lose. This is a minor complaint, however it can be a deal breaker for some, and also it's helpful to know.</li></ul>
<p>Overall while I do think the price and the inclusion of Saruman with this set as a cheaper alternative to Orthanc is great, I do feel that it is a bit of a pointless set for people aiming to own all of the LotR sets. Gandalf is still the same print we've seen over and over again, if it weren't for the fact that he comes with a hairpiece instead of a hat he'd be utterly worthless because you'd already own five or six of him across both LotR and The Hobbit Themes.</p>
<p>The look of the model is suitably impressive though, the lamps on either side of the throne are pretty fun looking builds. The play feature of the set is unobtrusive as well, you basically turn a technic pin hidden behind the throne to rotate the Pallantir and reveal Sauron's eye to Gandalf.</p>
<p>As far as this set goes, if you're looking to have 100% of The Lord of the Rings Theme get it, if you're just not able or interested in affording/picking up The Tower of Orthanc then definitely I recommend this. If neither of these things interest or apply to you than I'd say this is a set you can safely skip. (Although it is a good set for parts, especially the big clear dome pieces for lanterns.)</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,2,4
"lkb57","2014-02-11T22:40:09.74Z","Two Great Minifigs and the EYE, but a weak build","<p>To start this review off, I&#39;ll just say that I&#39;ve seen complaints about this set essentially being a weak reproduction of the second floor of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10237-1/Tower-of-Orthanc"">10237: Tower of Orthanc</a>, and I think those complaints are a little baseless. Sure, the throne is identical, but let&#39;s face the facts: not everyone is able to (or would even want to) go out and drop $200 bucks on a Lego set. For those buyers (who are probably the majority of people buying legos&nbsp;for their kids), this little set with Saruman and Gandalf is perfect. You still get the cool main characters and the Palantir, and it&#39;ll only set you back $12.99. Much more do-able.</p>

<p>As the title suggests, my review is this: this set is definitely worth it just to get your hands on the&nbsp;Saruman and Gandalf minifigs (both are unique to this set) and the Palantir/Eye of Sauron.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of angle pieces, and some fun &quot;fish-bowl&quot; pieces &nbsp;. . . but other than that this set doesn&#39;t contain a lot in the way of super-exciting pieces. But that&#39;s ok, because . . . .</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>&nbsp;. . . the minifigs are awesome! Especially Saruman. They captured this character perfectly. He has an angry/neutral face, but honestly it&#39;s hard to tell the difference since his mouth is covered by his (excellent) beard, which is of softer plastic. The printing of his robes is front and back on the torso and continues onto his legs. All-in-all, a fantastic little figure. Gandalf isn&#39;t too different from his other iterations, but it is nice to have a version of everyone&#39;s favorite wizard that has hair and not the hat. And finally, I&#39;ll include the Eye of Sauron here since it&#39;s a minifig&nbsp;head. The piece is transparent red with the Enemy&#39;s eye printed on both sides. It looks great as the Palantir, and I can already imagine a million other uses for it in LOTR and Hobbit themed MOCs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>So, to recap: buy this set for the minifigs, even if you&#39;re planning on getting the big Orthanc&nbsp;set. Why? Because personally I prefer this set&#39;s Palantir/Eye of Sauron to the greenish one that comes in the big set. You won&#39;t regret the purchase.</p>

This set goes along with the two minifig concept and has what the other two sets lack. Namely, playability.</p>

"Arceusrox","2014-03-11T19:55:32.173Z","They Removed the Brick Remover?","<p>Small sets don&#39;t usually look that intriguing, especially not on the box art. But something about this set caught my eye, and I decided to get it. I sure am glad I did too, because not only does this come with some great minifigs, but unlike many licensed&nbsp;sets, the set itself is amazing too, and it&#39;s worth getting for both the set and the minifigures.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This comes with a lot of good parts, like the pieces used to build the lamps. Saruman&#39;s&nbsp;brick built staff is made with some good pieces too. The palintir is wonderful, especially the Eye of Sauron piece which is fun to put on other minifigures.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Gandalf in this set has a double sided face, one smiling and the other yelling. He is slightly different than the other Gandalfs because he has no hat or cape. Saruman&nbsp;has a white cape, and a beard with a bit of grey on it. He also has a double sided face, one is neutral and the other is an evil grin.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very fun, but I always like building Lego sets, so I have nothing bad to say about it. It was cool to see the room come together, and see the mechanism that spins the palintir be built.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I love how it looks when it&#39;s completed. There&#39;s tons of playability in it and it looks great. It doesn&#39;t come with a brick remover though, which I was a little disappointed&nbsp;about, since I was looking forward to having one. The lamps look good and so does the throne, even though both fall apart easily.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen a $12 set with over 100 pieces before, so I was really happy to see that on the box. This is a very iconic seen and it&#39;s nice to be able to have it and Saruman without needing to spend $200. Grab it if you see it, it&#39;s probably my favorite $12 set so far!</p>

"SanMams91","2015-02-26T05:10:39.853Z","Not a bad way to get two cool wizards","<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box is designed in&nbsp;the usual LOTR style.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are actually quite a few parts that can be used for other builds in this set, which surprised me.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Honestly, the best part of the set. Saruman is arguably the best LOTR figure designed by LEGO for this theme, and Gandalf is not a bad figure&nbsp;either. Even though you don&#39;t get Saruman&#39;s&nbsp;robe slope dress, he is still a big draw of this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Again, the build was short, it was all right.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It is overall not a bad set. You get excellent figures, some interesting play features, the Eye of Sauron, and a bunch of black pieces. Not bad.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-06-01T06:58:50.093Z","It’s hard to believe that this is a 100 brick set! ","<p>So I&rsquo;ve only recently gotten my hands on a few LOTR sets, and like the rest, this one does not disappoint. The set contains basically 100 bricks and 2 minifigures, but wow!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s hard to complain about getting both Gandalf and Saruman&nbsp;in a set, but considering the size and price of the set it&rsquo;s amazing that Lego was this generous. Both minifigures&nbsp;are fantastic. I would have liked Gandalf&rsquo;s hat, but that is a minor problem. Saruman looks great, the only problem is his hair crushes his cape so I imagine after a while his cape will be very wrinkled.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Build&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The model certainly doesn&rsquo;t look like it only has 100 bricks. Compared to a similarly sized Star Wars set, this model seems much larger. I suppose that is probably because it doesn&rsquo;t contain too many smaller bricks, for the most part you are getting larger bricks in this set which certainly makes it a very good value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is relatively straightforward and symmetrical, but given how few bricks it uses that really isn&rsquo;t a problem. In the end the set looks fantastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that it contains two play features. The simple one is you push a technic axel to send Saruman flying out of his throne (which is designed beautifully to accommodate his cape). While it works, it is a feature I&rsquo;ve seen in Juniors sets. The other feature allows you to spin the palintir. Of course spinning a clear ball would be pointless, but since it contains the Eye of Sauron in it it actually looks pretty cool. But more importantly, it also spins the round base that holds the podium with the palintir, and since you can attach the back of Gandalf&rsquo;s legs to the base, it creates the effect of Saruman spinning Gandalf around.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Despite its size, this is a very nice set. Of course I don&rsquo;t have the tower, but that set of course is in whole different league and can&rsquo;t be compared to this one. This set&nbsp;portrays one of the most important scenes from the Fellowship of the Ring. Is an incredible value given you are getting two excellent minifigures. And comes with a very nice selection of bricks (Eye of Sauron, lamps and palintir, as well as the technic pieces needed for the spinning mechanics). If you can get this set I highly recommend you do.&nbsp;</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-01-22T22:45:08.067Z","A magical battle.","<p>This set is perfect for a Lego fan to travel to middle earth where Saruman&nbsp;and Gandalf are battling in the tower. It is a really cool looking and fun to play with set. It comes with two Minifigures&nbsp;and of course the room where they battle. It is perfect for those who missed out on the tower of Orthanc&nbsp;and those with it for an enlarged version. It has a really nice looking eye of sauron&nbsp;piece and a function so that when Saruman&nbsp;is sitting in his chair you can flick him out of his chair two meet Gandalf. I would highly recommend&nbsp;this set to any Lord of the Rings fans.</p>
