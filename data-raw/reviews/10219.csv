"Ernst","2013-06-01T16:42:58.657Z","The Council of Elrond; entering Rivendell","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong>: The finest and most elegant LOTR set by far until now. The first set that gives us a peek how Rivendell must look. Great choice of colors, a great new piece introduced, two exclusive minifigures and an wonderfull building result with a great gimmick when Gimli wants to destroy the ring. Maybe a bit expensive but if you search well you can find it for a good price. Totally worth the money and the five bricks ! The set reminds me a bit of the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7573-1"">7573&nbsp;Castle of the Prince of Persia</a>, which had the same elegance and great color mix&nbsp;in the back part.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks:</strong> The first part we built is the terrace where the meeting is, several tan bricks and arches connect the top and bottom floor. In between we built the trap that activates when Gimli wants to destroy the ring, it works very well. In the middle of the terrace a table in tan and pearl gold and on the side a tree in two shades of brown. Finally we built the three chairs with great looking stickers on the back of the chairs. The second bag gives us the great looking small building with grey bottom and dark tan floor and small stairs. Than the grey pillars and on the righthand side a dark brown tree stump. Tan plates in between and than white wall parts among which the new 1 x 3 x 3 arches. The roof again a dark tan plate, ornated with&nbsp;2 small pearl gold fences,&nbsp;that is connected with pins to the walls and decorated with several colored small slopes. In the building a small weapon rack and when finished you connect it with pins to the terrace part. A very good good and solid construction.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong>: A great color mix of part and all more than usefull. Extra remarks for of course the two exclusive Elf minifigures <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=lor059"">Elrond</a> and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=lor060"">Arwen</a>, they are awesome. Parts with an extra remark of course <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=13965"">the new arches</a>, the olive green and dark orange plant leaves, the several cornered ground plates, the pearl gold parts, 3 rings&nbsp;and the 2 gray micro figures. Even the stickers are great, both for the chairs and the Eye of Sauron. All worth more than 5 bricks but 5 is all we can give.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>: The set itself offers more than sufficient playing possibilities and even more if own more LOTR sets and minifigures. Here you can start the Journey of The Fellowship of the Ring. Besides that it is a great start for your personal implementation of Rivendell.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks</strong>: You can find it for several prices, the ToysXL retailprice is &euro;44,00 which is a bit expensive. With some searching you find it (in Holland) for &euro;32,00 which is a good price for this set. Because most toys retailshops come closer to the &euro;44,00 here I distracted one brick. But beside that definitly worth the money.</p>

"Shistavanen_brick","2013-06-06T06:42:38.67Z","The ring must be destroyed... ....what are we waiting for?  BOOM","I am very much blown away at the moment, at this wonderful little set. This might be the first (but hopefully not last) glimpse of the world of Middle-Earth elves in brick form. We've had elves before in different sets but neither has shown much of the elves' homes or buildings. This set delivers! It is very solemn, high fantasy in its structure &amp; the colours are just spot on. The fact that we get four minifigures (two of them are currently ONLY in this set) can make any LOTR fan smile a bit! The box art is very compelling, sort of: come on, buy this box. It shows Gimli taking flight after trying to destroy the ring of power.<div><br></div><h4>Minifigures.</h4><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Gimli:</b> This is my first Gimli-figure so I'm not quite sure, but I think this is the ""standard"" version that are in the other sets. Anyways, it's a great figure to have and perhaps the cheapest way to get him. He comes with the very dwarfish-looking face. It's two-sided. You also get his beard/hair-piece and the great detailed helmet. His torso is printed on both sides. Brown short legs to make him shorter. Of course an axe is included.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Frodo:</b> Also a great, but common figure. Two-sided face alongside his hobbit-curls of a hair-piece. Double-sided print on the torso, I am a big fan of his brown coat and the fact that LEGO has added so much detail on the vest &amp; shirt. Being a hobbit, his legs are also shorter. The sword Sting is included for him.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Arwen:</b> This is the first time we have seen Arwen as a minifigure. She looks absolutely fantastic! She comes with a blue dress decorated with silver and purple detailing. Two-sided face to display different reactions (it's a useful thing). Both Arwen and her father Elrond has a rubber hair-piece which gives it a whole lot of flexibility than standard plastic. Great job, LEGO.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Elrond:</b> Master Elrond in this version, in my opinion, actually surpasses the polybag version you could get if you pre-orderd the LOTR video-game. This figure is simply outstanding in every way possible. His torso and legs come in a darker red and have the coolest elvish-style printing you will see at the moment. Honestly, this might be one of the coolest minifigures ever. His hair-piece comes with the elvish crown/circlet in silver in the front, top notch! The most remarkable thing to make him even more of an elvish ruler, is his cape. It's red on the outside and gold on the inside.</div><div><br></div><h4>The council.</h4><div><br></div><div>The build is divided into two parts. First off is the terrace with three swiveling chairs, the small table in the middle (for the One Ring) and a nice looking tree. I love the colour-scheme in olive, tan, white and such. Combined it represents the scene in the movie greatly. There is a sticker for each chair and it looks just great. In a perfect world there would be only printed pieces instead of stickers but these are not too hard to apply for anyone, I would imagine. Three chairs are ok although we know more than three were summoned to the council.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>They have included a very playable catapult-function into the set. If you flashback to the movie, Gimli tried to destroy the ring with an axe and was tossed away in doing so. At the same time Frodo felt he was being watched by the Eye of Sauron. When you use the catapult-action in this set the Eye of Sauron (also a sticker) reveals itself in the floor section. Kind of cool, and GREAT fun for LOTR-fans of all ages.</div><div><br></div><div>The second part is more of a backdrop piece, but a cool one at that. It is very elvish in architecture, it has arches, pillars, tree limbs and a ""golden"" looking roof-top. You will like it, I'm sure. If you found similar coloured bricks sometime, you could easily build a more extensive Rivendell scene. You also get a small weapons-rack for two weapons. This part connects to the first part through technic-pins and becomes a sturdy complete model. Nice!</div><div><br></div><h4>Accessories.</h4><div><br></div><div>As far as weapons and other stuff, I think LEGO was quite generous. I don't know what is normal, but I got 2 elvish swords (the golden cool ones), 2 elvish style bows, 2 Sting swords and no less than 3 rings of power in my box.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><h4>Summary.</h4><div>I am very pleased with this set. Being a LOTR-fan, what is not to like? The new minifigures are nice additions to the growing family of LOTR figures. I think Elrond is the best of the set and a cheaper figure than Haldir (Helm's Deep) - and still better than Haldir. The entire council looks cool when finished and the only complaint is that it would have been nice with a slighlty larger council.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Elvish structured set.</li><li>Amazing new minifigures!</li><li>Almost price-worhty.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>None (well, perhaps it could have been a tad larger).</li></ul></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<p>The news that Lord of the Rings was to get a second wave of sets was very well received and the second smallest of the five sets released this year is a highlight for me.</p>

<p>One of the most popular settings from the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy is Rivendell, the home of Elrond and elves under his rule. In this set, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79006-1"">79006</a> The Council of Elrond, we get our&nbsp;first taste of this magnificent&nbsp;location in LEGO, and it really is a treat, perfectly capturing the area as it appears in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring film, directed by Peter Jackson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model includes four lovely Minifigures, one of whom is an&nbsp;exclusive character&nbsp;to this set and two&nbsp;of whom have been updated. With 243-pieces, this set is priced at &pound;29.99 or $29.99, and despite the fact that the &#39;price-to-piece&#39; ratio&nbsp;(which I tend to take with a pinch of salt anyway)&nbsp;is some way out,&nbsp;I believe this set is well worth the price.</p>

<hr />
<hr />
<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>The box artwork for this set really is delightful, showing the moment Gimli attempts to destroy the ring using his enormous axe, only to be thrown backwards as the ring is left unblemished. The beauty of the location is conveyed effectively by the packaging and there are some beautiful streams of light that are shining through the branches which surround the model. The box has a different border to the sets last year, this time featuring the eye of Sauron&nbsp;peeking out from the top of Barad-d&ucirc;r which is suitably menacing. The four Minifigures are also displayed in a gallery at the bottom of the box as usual.</p>

<p>The back of the box shows the set from a different perspective and displays the various features of the model. The weapons included are also shown off in one image.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9412430722/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7403/9412430722_14de9aea66_n.jpg"" style=""height:169px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>Inside the box are two numbered bags, an instruction booklet and a small sticker sheet. They are not packed with a cardboard backing to keep them straight unfortunately.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Four Minifigures are included in this set, and all four are excellent in my opinion. The first of these, who has appeared three times before, is <strong>Frodo Baggins</strong>. This Minifigure has some slight changes from previous editions of the character.&nbsp;His hair is the same mould as is used for all Hobbits, and it looks perfect in dark brown here. His head is unique to this Minifigure with a concerned expression&nbsp;on one side and an angry expression on the other, both of which are very nice indeed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9409658919/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2849/9409658919_94f8565535_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:275px"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9412424268/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3713/9412424268_690356fb0b_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:276px"" /></a></p>

<p>His torso is identical to that which appeared in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9470-1"">9470</a> Shelob Attacks and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9472-1"">9472</a> Attack on Weathertop with a brown jacket and dark red waistcoat. His shirt has a open collar and the jacket is printed on the back as well as the front with creases and a strap for adjusting the jacket. His legs are simply dark brown and short.</p>

<p>The only Minifigure in the set who has appeared before looking exactly the same is the ever-popular <strong>Gimli</strong>. His helmet is printed with an enormous amount of detail and looks exactly as it does in the film. It fits perfectly around his beard, but worn without the beard it looks rather strange as it is rather larger than a standard Minifigure head accessory. Gimli&#39;s head is printed with two different expressions, one neutral and the other angry. One both sides are some wrinkles and bushy brown eyebrows, although of course much of this detail is covered by his huge beard, which is cast in reddish brown and is a perfect likeness for Gimli&#39;s beard in The Lord of the Rings films.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9412422410/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7362/9412422410_4444314e66_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:279px"" /></a></p>

<p>His torso printing is totally obscured by the beard, although it is still highly detailed with padding and fur clothing, as well as a belt with a golden buckle. The back of the torso is printed with some more of his belt and various pockets. Just like Frodo, he has dark brown short legs. He carries a single accessory, an axe which he uses in this scene when he attempts to destroy the ring.</p>

<p>What really makes this set for me though are the two Elves, the first of whom is <strong>Elrond</strong>, who has appeared before in a polybag&nbsp;which came with pre-orders of the LEGO Lord of the Rings video game. This is a far superior version of the character in my opinion and is bound to be popular. His braided hair piece is rubbery and also includes his Elven ears as well as a metallic silver headband. The head is very detailed with two faces (as are all four Minifigures in fact), one with a rather stern expression, and the other with a smile. Wrinkles and brown eyebrows are printed on both sides which are very accurate to the film.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9412419588/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5347/9412419588_cdce157dd7_n.jpg"" style=""height:318px; width:320px"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9409650279/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3749/9409650279_f8e3ea09b2_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:314px"" /></a></p>

<p>Elrond wears a cape which is yellow on the inside and dark red on the outside. I love these dual colour capes and this component is identical to the one worn in the film. His torso too is very accurate, printed with a dark red jacket and metallic gold shirt underneath. There are various little scroll details also included which are excellent. The back of the torso, despite being covered by the cape, is also printed with more of his red jacket and the tiny silver scrollwork. His hips and legs are printed with a continuation of this design. I have to say, this is quite possibly among the best Minifigures of the year in my opinion, it is particularly detailed and it is great to have a definitive Minifigure of such an interesting and popular character.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have Elrond&#39;s daughter <strong>Arwen</strong>, another popular character. It was a subject of some discussion last year that not one female Lord of the Rings Minifigure had been produced, which was particularly surprising given the importance of some to the plot. Now this has been at least partially rectified with this Minifigure, and I think it has been well worth the wait as this is another outstanding Minifigure. Her hairpiece is a unique mould much like Elrond&#39;s, with Elven ears and a detailed cast. This piece too is rubberised and cast in dark brown. A face is printed on both sides of her head, one with a cheerful expression, and the other with a slightly irritated look, although both faces are fairly similar and the differences are subtle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9409646801/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7290/9409646801_dfc5f3aeb1_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:233px"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9409642381/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3704/9409642381_f325f4a831_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:224px"" /></a></p>

<p>Her dress is superb, with various frills and details all over it. The torso and skirt (which is formed in the usual manner using a 2 x 2 x 2 slope piece) are both sand blue in colour and they match up nicely. She carries the slightly longer variation of the bow piece just like Legolas, which I far prefer to the shorter version which is included in some sets.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>The build is fairly entertaining for a relatively small set, taking about thirty minutes. The trees are built to appear irregular and natural, quite effectively for the use of &#39;legal&#39; building techniques. The manner in which the steps towards the right of the model are created is also very attractive, using 4 x 4&nbsp;quarter circle pieces to capture the unique architecture of Rivendell. The roof of the small building is detailed with 1 x 1&nbsp;(cheese) slopes to represent tiles and the latticed peak of this roof is formed using pearl gold 1 x 4 fence pieces which are also brilliant in appearance.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>This is a set which has some real charm about it. What it may lack in size it more than makes up for in detail and density of parts. The model is split into two sections, the meeting area where the council of Elrond actually takes place, and a small building which nicely captures the architecture seen in Rivendell.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9409640555/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7360/9409640555_abce251283_n.jpg"" style=""height:271px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>I will begin with the council area which is what one builds first according to the instructions. Three chairs, which can swivel and each utilise&nbsp;a sticker to create the decorative backs of each seat, are dispersed around a central pedestal. This looks rather grand with two pearl gold 4 x 4 round pieces making up the top and bottom of the table, and the ring sits on top just like in the film. The only real feature to speak of in the set comes here, where a button can be pressed to send Gimli (or any other Minifigure of course) flying after he attempts to destroy the ring with his axe. This is a nice enough feature as it is, and it works perfectly, although I love the fact that the extra detail of the eye of Sauron being visible when the catapult lifts up, recreating Frodo&#39;s brief hallucination during this scene in the film. A tree stands over the scene, and uses two large leaf pieces in dark orange, which are unique to this set and look lovely. This is&nbsp;no doubt a piece which will be sought after by MOC builders.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9409635957/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5494/9409635957_96fd7f21ce_n.jpg"" style=""height:188px; width:250px"" /></a></p>

<p>Not to be outdone though, the small building area also includes a brand new component, shallow arches in white which look fantastic in my opinion. The same piece is available in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79007-1"">79007</a> Battle at the Black Gate in black. A small weapon stand is included here which holds an Elven sword (which appeared previously with the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=5000202-1"">Elrond polybag</a> mentioned earlier and in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79004-1"">79004</a> Barrel Escape) and Sting, the sword wielded by Bilbo Baggins and later Frodo. The architecture of this building really is superb given its small size, using five rounded pillars and the new arch pieces to capture Rivendell perfectly. A couple of light bluish grey Microfigures are included which act as statues. A nice curved staircase runs down from this building and beside this is another tree, again making use of a dark orange leaf piece, as well as two olive green ones.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>This is a set which I would label as a &#39;must have&#39; for fans of Lord of the Rings without hesitation. The Minifigures are excellent, the parts selection is incredible and the set looks fantastic. Although lacking in features, this set is still a lot of fun, thanks in no small part to the wonderful Minifigures as well as the fact that just about everything one could want to recreate the relevant scene from the film is included.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9409623899/"" title=""79006 The Council of Elrond by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""79006 The Council of Elrond"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7341/9409623899_20dc45c086_n.jpg"" style=""height:232px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>However, there is no doubt that the real quality of this set lies in how it looks on display. The Autumnal but bright atmosphere of Rivendell is certainly captured in the model and I think this set is one which should&nbsp;be placed right at the centre of your Lord of the Rings collection.</p>

<p>Parts: <strong>5</strong> - Some very useful parts we have seen before plus the added bonus of some lovely new pieces is delightful.</p>

<p>Playability: <strong>4.5</strong> - Few features when compared with other sets, although I still think there is a lot of fun to be had.</p>

<p>Building Experience: <strong>5</strong> - For a set at this price point there are more than enough interesting building techniques used.</p>

<p>Value for Money: <strong>5</strong> - Four Minifigures and a lovely little set seems well worth the price to me.</p>

<p>Overall: <strong>5</strong> - This is a set which I recommend very highly. Elrond and Arwen are well worth&nbsp;picking up loose if you cannot justify the cost of the entire set, although you will not be disappointed if you do purchase it.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2013-07-26T08:33:03.493Z","What about a catapult? ","Those must have been glorious times indeed when one of the pivotal moments in Peter Jackson's three-hour, multipart, blockbuster epic was actually nothing more than a droning political discussion, <i>and no one complained about it</i>. Or maybe people did complain about it, but just with less volume since social media had yet to come into vogue.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>But that's enough decade-old nostalgia for now. The Council of Elrond has now come to us in LEGO form, and the folks at home can now recreate that riveting Middle-Earth policy meeting for oneself. I was pretty thrilled when I saw this set unveiled earlier in the year (perhaps it was the afterglow from the official revelation that the Lord of the Rings was getting a second wave), but I feel that there are perhaps some things that are left to be desired.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first positive thing that I can say, though, is that this set stands up to scrutiny much better than Uruk-Hai Army (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=9471-1"">9471</a>) does, that US$30 ""expansion pack"" that LEGO compelled all of us to buy to accompany Helm's Deep (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=9474-1"">9474</a>). Equivalent in price and aesthetically superior, the Council of Elrond is able to at least stand on its own as a separate set, much unlike the aforementioned Uruk-Hai Army. However, being a slightly cheaper standalone set does come with its own set of problems, which I will discuss shortly.</div><div><br></div><div>Four Minifigs is fairly generous for a (licensed) set of this size, though avid collectors of the first wave will undoubtedly have multiple Frodos and Gimlis already. Our friend Elrond looks absolutely fantastic here, and a whole lot better than the <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/search/?query=lor033"">hideous version</a> that came as a pre-order bonus of some kind, I don't really remember. His (and Arwen's) hairpiece are packaged separately and made of that softer and more flexible material, and both pieces of sufficiently high quality that I don't think you'll encounter any issues. Elrond also has a very cool two-colour cape, and what I have to bemoan here is this trend of having characters with hairpieces that interfere with the cape. I believe that Haldir from the Helm's Deep set was my first time encountering this, and it really does annoy me that one is forced to flatten and effectively crush the Minifig cape in order to get everything to sit properly. If anyone knows a better way of ""dressing up"" Minifigs to avoid this issue, I would be glad to hear it. Anyway, all the characters are beautifully printed, and you get a whole host of spare weapons to boot.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Like most of the Lord of the Rings line, the main build itself goes more for aesthetics and much less for playability. In fact, there is a grand total of one gimmick here: a slightly strange mechanism that allows you to fling Gimli/Frodo/Captain America away from the ring pedestal. It's of, erm, limited utility at best, and the fact that the Eye of Sauron is a sticker does it no favours. It should be said that this must be one of the only licensed sets in existence that doesn't have flick-fire missiles, although they could perhaps be incorporated under the roof so that Elves can rain hot death down on would-be invaders, or something.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The rest of the meeting area is quite pleasant and spacious, with a very muted fall colour scheme that does a really outstanding job of replicating the scenes from the movie. Unfortunately, unless you do a bit of engineering on your own, the rest of the Fellowship is forced to stand around since only three can sit, but such are the limitations of price.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The ""porch"" attached to the meeting area is slightly more questionable. At certain angles it looks great and does a decent job at capturing the architectural feel of Rivendell in very few pieces, and the curved steps in particular are simple yet attractive. On the other hand, I don't think I've seen a four-stud-wide building component since...I don't know, <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6259-1"">1991</a>? Am I exaggerating? Probably, but the point I'm trying to make is that it's tiny, and it's hard to fit more than one Minifig in there without feeling claustrophobic.

This is not to say that Council of Elrond is a bad set, but perhaps one could think of it as a start-up kit that's up to you to expand on - gods know that there's probably thousands of <a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=lego%20rivendell&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wi&amp;ei=YWvyUbuaMJLk8gSdyoCQCw&amp;biw=1017&amp;bih=662&amp;sei=Y2vyUeqCLJO89gT954D4Ag"">Rivendell MOCs</a> out there.

"Almaras","2013-06-16T02:51:30.15Z","'The Last Homely House East of the Sea'","<p>Although this is a medium sized set, it really packs a lot in! The Elvish architecture comes across splendidly, making great use of the new arch pieces and incorporating trees into the structure of the building.</p>

<p>The minifigures included in this set are: Elrond, Arwen, Gimli and Frodo. The two new Elves included are fantastic. Elrond is dressed in his elegant robes to lead the council, and the finery really comes across with the gold detailing. His torso has double sided printing, but unfortunately the back isn't seen once his cape and hair piece are on. The two toned cape (red on the outside and gold on the inside) looks incredible and blends with his torso nicely. His face is different from the one included in the polybag 2nd Age Elrond, this one features a stern face and a face with a slight smile, both of which bear great resemblance to Hugo Weaving. His hair piece is made of high quality rubber that is detailed down to his braids, but is difficult to place with the cape. Next is Arwen - the first female minifigure to be included in TLOTR series (not included Tauriel from The Hobbit). Arwen's hair piece is of the same, high quality rubber as Elrond's - though she doesn't share her father's hairstyle! The detail of the printing on her body is superb, even including the stitching on her torso. Unfortunately she is wearing a long dress, so she is without legs to articulate (though this is easily fixed by sourcing a pair of legs from the LR Cavalry Builder set, which are the same blue and work well). There isn't anything overwhelming about her face, other than the standard Elven-cheekbones. Gimli is a great little fig, I love the detail on his helmet and his eyes have a twinkle that remind me of Hagrid when hidden behind his bushy beard, and his torso has a great medieval feel to it. The only let down is that he is the same as the Gimli's included in other sets, though it is nice to have him appear in a cheaper set. Frodo's torso is also the same as others seen, but his new face is fantastic! His worried expression is of great resemblance to Frodo from the Fellowship of the Ring, and it is great to have an angry face for him. </p>

<p>For the size of the set, the setting for the council achieves a lot. The three chairs look great with the stickers (though printed pieces would have been preferable!), which is a good thing, because between no legs, stubby legs and capes that would look better crinkle free, none of the figures can easily sit on them. The overhanging tree and the tree growing from the archway is, for me, the definition of Elvish architecture and really make the set. I like that the foliage flows through the set with the inclusion of small leaf pieces throughout the base, and the new autumn tones are more than welcome! The pedestal holding the ring makes a good centrepiece, particularly the round, gold plates, and the play feature to throw back Gimli when he hits the ring works better than I had expected (though obviously Lego haven't been told that nobody tosses a dwarf). The appearance of the eye of Sauron is an unexpected inclusion, but I find that the red pieces detract from it. </p>

<p>The white arch way is surprisingly solid and is capable of holding the weight of the set. Once straight, the cheese slops on the roof make great tiles, tying into the tones seen throughout the set and adding to the sloping effect. I always love when Lego include the microfigures as statues, and the two in this set are no exception! The weapons rack seems like an odd inclusion to the peaceful setting of the council, but take it away and the back half of the set does seem lacking. I would have perhaps preferred a bigger statue, possibly even holding the shards of Narsil!</p>

<p>This is quite a peaceful set and one that really strikes a chord with me. Rivendell has always been my favourite setting (I am still crossing my fingers for a full sized Rivendell set!) and this captures the serene feeling perfectly. There is very little conflict in this set, other than the Gimli-flinger and the glimpse of the eye, so playability is somewhat reduced, but it makes for a fantastic display piece! </p><p>&nbsp;</p><font size=""4""><p>(I should also note that although there is a brick lifter alongside the set in the official images, my set does not contain a brick lifter and a brick lifter does not appear in the parts list at the end of the manual.)</p></font>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Telcontar","2013-06-16T20:51:19.247Z","Imladris, Home of Elrond Half-Elven","<p>Imladris is the Elvish name for Rivendell for those who aren't as well versed in Middle-earth lore.  It was the home of Elrond Half-elven (but that's another story for another time).  You couldn't have a Middle-earth theme without a Rivendell set as it was one of the most important elvish lands in the second and third ages. </p><p>…</p><h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The bags of pieces filled nearly all the space in the box proving that LEGO is making good on it's promises of packaging in smaller box sizes.  The instructions were slightly bent and so was the small sticker sheet, but it didn't affect the building process.  The box itself was nicely decorated.  For this year of sets [2013] we get the top of Barad-dur with The Eye in the top right corner as opposed to The Ring on Sauron's finger (which we saw last year in 2012).  </p><p>…</p><h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts selection in this set is one of the best parts (no pun intended).  Lots of tan, brown and white.  The new orange colored foliage is particularly nice as well as the rare olive green color.  I also particularly like the grey microfigures and the new white pointed arch pieces.  A few elvish weapons are included as well which are always a nice addition. </p><p>Note: The set <em>does not </em>come with a brick sperator even though it is pictured with one here on Brickset.&nbsp; I checked the&nbsp;parts list in the back of the instructions and a brick seperator is not listed.&nbsp; The same thing happened with the Wizard Battle set.&nbsp;</p><p>...</p><h4>Minifigures</h4><p><strong>Frodo Baggins: </strong>This Frodo is a lot like other versions of him that we got last year but he is exclusive.  He does not come with a small cape and is face (which is double sided) has two new expressions.  The first is very much like the main head we see in Attack on Weathertop and Shelob Attacks, but his eyebrows are tilted down a bit more so he looks more sad than weary.  The other side is like an angry face.  With the addition of this head we now can have 6 different faces for Frodo (2 in Shelob Attacks or Weathertop, 2 in Gandalf Arrives, and 2 in this set).</p><p><strong>Gimli: </strong>This minifig is exactly like ones in other sets except that his axe handle is 4 studs long instead of three.  I've said it before but I'll say it again, I can't believe the detail they put into his torso, beard, and helmet.  Incredible Accuracy!</p><p><strong>Arwen: </strong>She wasn't at the Council of Elrond but they probably won't make another set in Rivendell so this is a logical place to put her.  Her printing is quite nice but not super extraordinary.  Her head is double sided (neutral/angry).  I don't really like the cheekbones they put on her but with her hairpiece on you can barely see them.  That hairpiece is a bit rubbery and fits on the head really well, a little too well it seems sometimes.  Overall though she makes for a very nice minifigure.</p><p><strong>Elrond: </strong>Elrond is in my opinion one of the best minifigs of this LotR line.  His torso and leg printing is exquisite.  The detailing and colors are extraordinary.  His cape is quite something too with one side being a tan color the other being a deep red.  He is the first LEGO elf I've seen with printed cheekbones that I actually like.  His head is double sided (neutral/angry).  His hair piece is a lot like Arwen's in design but it is a different mold.  I like really like his painted silver ""crown"".   </p><p>…</p><h4>The build</h4><p>The build is modular.  You build the ""porch"", then the small building, and put them together via technic pins.  Building the tree, steps, and building were particularly fun.  I like how the one tree forms part of the building.  It may not make complete sense from a practical standpoint but it looks cool and fits with the nature of Rivendell and its inhabitants.  </p><p>…</p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model looks quite a bit like Rivendell in the film.  But it does seem a bit small.  The porch isn't certainly big enough for many more characters but it holds the minifigs it comes with nicely.  The play feature where you can launch Gimli after he tries to destroy The One Ring works very well as long as you hold the model down and push the bar quickly.  What's really neat is that once you push the bar to flip the floor up The Eye appears beneath.  If you remember from the film when Gimli whacked The Ring with his axe The Eye appeared for a brief second so this is actually quite accurate.  Overall it looks very nice though, a great model of a small part of Rivendell.    </p><p>…</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall this is a great lower-to-mid-range set.  I only have two complaints: #1. The Price.  $30 is a bit too much.  For this much it should've been bigger so we could at least fit a few more minifigs on it if not the whole Fellowship (+Elrond).  #2. The Stickers.  All the chairs require stickers which can be a bit tricky at times.  Other than those two things I think it's a great set,  great pieces, amazing minifigs, and quite a bit of playability without bad guys vs. good guys.  Even though it's a fantastic set I don't see it as being super popular with kids just because there's not much action in this scene on the exterior (i.e. no battles or something like that).  It'll be a must have for AFOLs &amp; MOCers though because of the parts selection (especially the orange foliage). </p><p><em>Agoreg vae LEGO!</em>&nbsp; </p><p>…</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-10T21:22:18.667Z","You shall be The Fellowship of the Ring","<p><strong>Set #79006 The Council of Elrond:</strong> The Lord of the Rings Theme introduced five sets in 2013, 4 at major retailers across the globe and 1 as a LEGO store exclusive, the highly detailed and impressive looking Tower of Orthanc. This set is priced at 34.99$ in Canada and features the first and only female Mini-Figure from LotR to exist to date.</p>
<p>It's also a pretty nice looking set although it is a bit on the smallish side as far as screen accuracy goes. It uses modular building techniques for combining the two halves of the model, which is fairly decent. Anyway let's get on with reviewing the set properly.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The new design for LEGO Lord of the Rings boxes in 2013 features a design with colouring that is different from the first wave. It's still a gorgeous looking design, it shows off the set as well as can be expected, there are very few play features with this set so the box doesn't have nearly as many images as those found in other sets. Still a great looking design.</p>
<p>The instructions are nice looking, they share the design seen on the boxes and they actually feel thicker than I thought they would for a set this size... I will say this though, as is often the case there is no protection and the larger size of the manual means that it could be damaged during the packing phase. Stickers are included on a small sheet for certain details, hopefully this one won't be damaged or bent when you purchase the set because these are some actually pretty nice looking stickers.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>First off this set includes Microfigures from LEGO Games as part of the build, so if you enjoy plain Microfigures for statues or other MOC techniques you'll find a few of them here. There's also a lot of other useful pieces, a large selection of angle plates, thin colomn pieces and a great number of autumn coloured leaves. It's a pretty decent parts pack for this price range.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Four more Mini-Figures are introduced in this set, among them only two of them are actually brand new.</p>
<p>Gimli the Dwarf is the third most abundant Mini-Figure in LotR sets, he can be found in four sets all with the same print, accessories and awesome looking head gear. As I said in Mines of Moria this is one really fun looking Mini-Figure.</p>
<p>Frodo in this set is wearing the same outfit he's been seen in other sets, the differences here is he doesn't have a cape and actually has different printing on his head. There's a nervous looking expression as the Fellowship and friends discuss what to do about the ring and a determined expression as he declares that he will take the ring to Mordor.</p>
<p>Elrond is in a new outfit, he's a great looking Mini-Figure with a dark maroon coloured torso and some really awesome print detail on his double-sided&nbsp;torso and legs. I believe he's using the same head as the Elrond from the Second Age bonus with the Video Game pre-orders, oh no I'm wrong sorry, this is a new double-sided head showing Elrond smiling on one side and frowning on the other. The best aspect of this Mini-Figure is the unique hair piece and the double-sided cloth cape. Yes that is correct one side is a rich dark maroon colour and the other is a softer orange tone for the inner lining.</p>
<p>Arwen is a brand new Mini-Figure as well and is the only female character from The Lord of the Rings (Tauriel is a Hobbit female Mini-Fig from the same universe of course, interesting that so far we've only had two elven females, where's Sam's girlfriend/wife or Eowyn LEGO?)</p>
<p>I love her soft colours, Arwen's prints are also really impressive with her double-sided torso and printed sloped brick for legs. She's got the new bow piece and a double-sided face as well.</p>
<p>I really like the selection of Mini-Figures in this set, though at the same time I would have hoped that Gimli might have included a new hair piece since these were released after The initial Hobbit wave and they sculpted a lot of great hair pieces for dwarves. It'd be nice to have a Gimli with hair piece for when he takes his helmet off during lull times before the big battle at Helm's Deep.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set has two numbered bags and uses Modular build techniques, the first bag builds the tree and seating area from Rivendell while the second bag builds the short staircase leading to the seats and the side of one of the Elven builings with archways and a small weapons rack.</p>
<p>It's a slightly repetitive build in certain steps, but it's very satisfying and the steps are easy to follow. Some people might prefer to have a larger structure, after all there are only three chairs when in the scene at least a dozen or more characters sat around the stone table to discuss the ring, still it could be worse. It could be like the throne in Wizard's Battle.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This model looks a bit like an incomplete one honestly. It's a small area of Rivendell, and as we all know from the films Rivendell is a very impressive place to visit with beautiful buildings and scenery climbing up the side of a massive waterfall/mountainous region. The colours in this set are really nice and look great together, I also think the model works for what it is.</p>
<p>The fact that it includes a small play feature revealing the eye of Sauron is a bit fun actually, I like the fact that you can put Gimli in front of the table swinging his axe at the one ring (which sits on a jumper plate) and then you can push a section near the tree to have him flip up and reveal the eye of Sauron. It's a simple play feature that works, and isn't some tacked on Flick-Fire Missile gimmic or something equally silly.</p>
<p>There's also only a small sticker sheet compared to Mines of Moria which used a lot of stickers. This is nice, it isn't printed detail work, but it is preferable than loading a set down with stickers.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I think this is a nice beginning for a potential series of Rivendell sets that connect together, really I'd love to see this set be incorporated into a future model that completes the building near the seats and makes for more Rivendell. Perhaps an Older Bilbo's living area and some stairs with an outlook and a bench and a lot of great trees and designed elements.</p>
<p>As it stands this is a great set with a lot of potential, unfortunately I have this sad notion that we won't be seeing any more Rivendell based sets. The Mini-Figures in this set are all impressive too, it's nice they gave Frodo a new expression to match the scene and Elrond and Arwen are perfect too, Gimli is the odd one out in that while he is a great looking Mini-Fig if you've purchased the previous LotR sets you already own two of him.</p>
<p>I recommend this to the fans of the series because it's the only section of Rivendell we may be getting from LEGO considering how little we've heard of new sets for this Theme.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
"lkb57","2014-02-12T19:45:18.397Z","An Awesome Set . . . but why another Gimli?","<p>This set surprised me. When I first saw it, I was surprised . . . it didn&#39;t seem like the Council of Elrond was a scene from the book/movie that was exciting enough to merit it&#39;s own Lego set. I mean, sure, it&#39;s pivotal in the show, but Legos are a childrens&#39; toy, so I was expecting to get a set portraying a battle or something. Thankfully, after having built the set, I can report that it does not disappoint! TLC has managed to cram a lot of playability into it, and rounded the set out nicely with two exclusive minifigures: Arwen and Elrond.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The first pleasant surprise about this set is that it has a lot of fun pieces: autumn-colored leaves, lots of brown arches for branches, a variety of cheese slopes in &quot;Rivendell&quot; golds, browns and greens, several gray column pieces and some white arches . . . basically this set helps you stock up on castle-building equipment. Also welcome were the longbow and the gold elven&nbsp;sword/spear.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Ok, IMO the minifigures are both this set&#39;s greatest strength, and greatest disappointment. Why? Well, Elrond and Arwen are both awesome. They are unique to this set, and fantastically made, as usual for Lego minifigs. They both have double-printed heads, with angry/neutral expressions. Their hair-pieces are softer plastic that show their pointed elf ears, and Elrond&#39;s hair also has a silver crown. Their torsos are printed front and back, and the printing of Elrond&#39;s robe and Arwen&#39;s dress continues down his legs and her slope &quot;dress&quot; piece. Elrond&#39;s cape is one of those rare two-toned capes, gold on the inside and dark red on the outside. All in all, awesome figs.</p>

<p>Frodo is great, but not all that different from his other iterations . . . he doesn&#39;t have a cape, and the expressions on his head are slightly different. Nothing much to get excited about.</p>

<p>And last we come to my main grievance with the set: Gimli. Don&#39;t get me wrong&ndash;&ndash;growing up, Gimli was my favorite member of the Fellowship, and I still have a soft-spot for the little guy. But this particular minifig&nbsp;now appears in 4 sets! Why did we need another one? I understand that in the film it&#39;s Gimli who tries to destroy the ring with his axe, and this set allows you to recreate that little bit of action. But I would have much rather had a new Sam minifig, or a new Aragorn minifig wearing his Rivendell&nbsp;robes . . . or even a non-unique Boromir, since currently he only comes in one set. You can get Gimli in so many other sets that his inclusion here kind of just feels like a cop-out.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Ok, to finish this off, let me end on a high note: despite the fact that it comes with yet another Gimli instead of a newer minifigure, this set is still awesome. Currently, it&#39;s the only way for you to get your hands on (this version of) Elrond and Arwen, and for that reason alone it&#39;s a must-buy. But it also has a lot of fun playability (like a magically appearing Eye of Sauron), and some fun accessories that make it worth the price. Grab it while you can!</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-10-24T04:52:04.657Z","Fantastic set with a few flaws","<p>So this is a Lego set depicting the location of an argument. However, given that there aren&#39;t too many other locations in Rivendell&nbsp;that see any action&nbsp;it actually does make sense. Of course the best part of the set is that you will want it for both the model and the minifigures!</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>So you get 4 minifigures&nbsp;in this set. Elrond is fantastic looking with a 2-toned cape and&nbsp;unique hairpiece with a silver crown. Arwen also looks great, like Elrond she is completely unique from other elves, and she has a dress. The Frodo in this set is supposedly unique, but its uniqueness is trivial. Finally Gimli&nbsp;is identical to all his other minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now I understand why you would include Gimli, after all he is unique in that he is the only one who actually tried to destroy the ring. It&#39;s also hard to argue against the inclusion of Frodo. But, these have to be the most common minifigures&nbsp;around. I would have much preferred an older Bilbo or a Boromir or one of the other hobbits. There is also one other problem I have with the minifigures, but I will discuss that when I discuss the model.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>There are certainly some unique parts that are hard to get in this set. First you have the trees with the autumn foliage. You have columns and archs. Plus a handful of large plates (great for Star Wars builds as well). You also get some gold, mostly in the form of cheese slopes, but also two round 4x4 plates. Plus a small collection of weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Its divided into two bags, each of which build a separate component of the set. The first bag builds the setting of the council which features the sets only play feature. The build isn&#39;t anything too exciting and is very simple. It is very similar to the build for the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79005-1/The-Wizard-Battle"">Wizard Battle</a> set in which you also are building an elevated platform, only the play feature in this one is not as complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag two is the more interesting build (and more interesting model) where you are building the facade of a building in Rivendell. While it still isn&#39;t complex, it also isn&#39;t repetitive or logical. My favorite part of the build is one of the simplest parts, building the stairs. You are just stacking quarter circles but it looks great and is definitely something I&#39;ll think of using in MOCs. The build is also surprisingly sturdy when completed which I didn&#39;t expect as I was putting up the tree and columns.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Model&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The model looks great. While the setting for the meeting may be in the foreground and fairly boring, it&#39;s tree works very well with the building facade in the background. The chairs, while simple, also look very appropriate for Rivendell, although I kind of doubt that they had swivel recliners! It is the building facade that makes this set, and in a way I wish that the set was only composed of facades like this, but of course that would make it strictly a display piece and not a set you could play with. I do think that Lego did an excellent job with making a Rivendell&nbsp;set with a small brick count.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set only has one play feature which is fine, although other LOTR sets have spoiled me into expecting more. It isn&#39;t triggered by Gimli&nbsp;trying to break the ring, but you instead push a sliding mechanism that launches Gimli&nbsp;off a &quot;catapult&quot; and reveals the Eye of Sauron underneath it. It doesn&#39;t work great, but it does work, and it adds some much needed playability to an otherwise &quot;peaceful&quot; set.</p>

<p>That said the set does have two shortcomings. First, it houses a small weapon rack. I would have much preferred for this to be the table that holds the sword that is broken (which would also justify including Boromir). Yes you may have to expand the set a bit to do this, but it would have been well worth it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My other complaint is with the minifigures. You have 3 seats, but 4 minifigures. Now of course I believe that most people at the council were standing, but shouldn&#39;t you include enough seats to accommodate the minifigures included in the set? Of course that raises the next problem, 3 of the minifigures can&#39;t even sit down! Frodo and Gimli&nbsp;have short non-posable legs and Arwen has a dress. So not only can Arwen&nbsp;not sit, she can&#39;t ride a horse from your Weathertop set to your Rivendell&nbsp;set.&nbsp;Only Elrond can sit down, and since he wears a cape, it would have to be removed for him to sit, the chairs aren&#39;t designed as well as Saruman&#39;s throne in the wizard battle. Even the pictures on the box depict minifigures standing on the chairs! Certainly this could have been thought out better. But the chairs are definitely needed or you would be left with a boring platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I really do love this set despite my complaints. It looks great and Rivendell&nbsp;is a location that needs to be represented. I&#39;m actually glad it is represented as a smaller set and not as something larger, because the only way to do Rivendell justice as a larger set would be to build it on the scale of the Ewok Village set which just doesn&#39;t seem necessary although it would be beautiful. This set can be found for $30-35 if you search hard enough, and if you can get it in that price range, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to buy it.&nbsp;</p>
