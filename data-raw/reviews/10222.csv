<p>While Huw is doing an excellent job providing some reviews of the second wave of Galaxy Squad sets, I have been charged with reviewing some Star Wars sets this summer. Apologies for my photography; I am not nearly as experienced with the actual taking of photos with the correct lighting and such as Huw or DrDaveWatford, nor am I particularly savvy when it comes to Photoshop. Hopefully I will improve with time.</p>

<p>The LEGO Star Wars summer wave met with some criticism when set names and images were first revealed as the vast majority of these sets are remakes, as well as being almost exclusively from the Prequel Trilogy and The Clone Wars, which is not necessarily as universally popular as the Original Trilogy.</p>

<p>The smallest set of this summer&rsquo;s selection is <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75015-1"">75015</a>, Corporate Alliance Tank Droid, consisting of 271-pieces and priced at a very reasonable &pound;19.99 or $19.99. While the set itself inspired little interest initially, thanks both to the relative obscurity of the vehicle and the fact that we last saw a Corporate Alliance Tank Droid only four years ago in set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7748-1"">7748</a>, one Minifigure in particular has created some excitement surrounding this set, that being the notorious Jango Fett, in his first outing in LEGO since 2002.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>Just like most other sets released recently, the box size is distinctly smaller than one might expect for a &pound;19.99 set, although significantly deeper. On the front we can see a rather attractive shot of the vehicle in action, along with the lovely green border and image of Yoda along the top. The standard Minifigure gallery is also included, with Jango Fett and the Geonosis Battle Droid both being labelled as &lsquo;new.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9023734970/"" title=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3768/9023734970_1a7d116178.jpg"" style=""height:262px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>The back of the box shows off the features of the set and has a few more images of the vehicle at the Battle of Geonosis being supported by Jango Fett and the Battle Droid. The single Clone Trooper seems somewhat overwhelmed to me.</p>

<p>The instructions are nice and flat in the box, along with two numbered bags. The two large dish pieces which form much of the Tank Droid from the sides are loose inside the box but there is very little risk of damage to them.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Three Minifigures are included, each of which I like very much (although Jango Fett is of course the star attraction). Perhaps the least interesting for me is the <strong>Clone Trooper</strong>, who is identical to the one which appeared in set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75000-1"">75000</a> earlier in 2013. He is based on the Phase I Clone troopers who appear in Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones with a very accurate helmet design, complete with vents and holes on either side of the helmet to add some of the Clone Trooper equipment introduced in 2008 if you wish. His head beneath the helmet is also very nice, featuring eyebrows and a rather aggressive expression. His torso is printed front and back with all the details we see on the Clone Troopers in the film, including ammunition pouches, the segmented armour plating and a grenade. The arms and legs are plain white with no printing and he carries a DC-15A blaster rifle which is made up of a standard large blaster and a Technic pin.</p>

<p>Next, we have a <strong>Geonosis Battle Droid</strong>, who is identical to any other Battle Droid but for the addition of a 1 x 2 plate acting as a backpack and the colouration of the Minifigure, which is dark orange as opposed to the usual tan. This colour looks excellent and he comes equipped with a small blaster. The backpack is a nice touch as well, which surprised me as the Battle Droid is without it in any of the images on the box. I look forward to purchasing a few more of these on Bricklink as a small army of them would look excellent coming up against some Clone Troopers.</p>

<p>Lastly, and without a doubt the best Minifigure of all in my opinion, we have the Mandalorian <strong>Jango Fett</strong>, who has inexplicably not been updated since 2002, which is extraordinary for such a popular character. His helmet looks brilliant in pearl silver, with accurate blue highlights around his visor. A hole is left for a range-finder to be attached and the two tiny arrows which are on the actual film prop are also included on the forehead section of the helmet. His face is equally perfect with a little bit of stubble and some scarring. It is in fact identical to that of the recent Boba Fett Minifigures as one would expect as Boba is a clone of Jango.</p>

<p>His jet-pack is cast in pearl silver, and matches up very nicely with the silver armour printed on the front and back of his torso, which is rather shiny against his dark bluish grey tunic and brown utility belt. His arms, hips and legs are sand blue, which I think is the perfect colour and his hips and legs are even printed with some extra details including kneepads and holsters; much like Boba Fett is in set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9496-1"">9496</a>, Desert Skiff.&nbsp; He is armed with a pair of light bluish grey guns, which I believe were originally fire hose nozzles, to represent his Westar-34 blaster pistols, and they do a decent job, certainly better than the revolvers which he included in 2002.</p>

<p>Placed beside his son Boba Fett, Jango certainly matches his counterpart&rsquo;s level of detail, lacking only the printing on his feet which would make them nigh on identical. They look brilliant side by side, although they never appeared together like this in the films of course.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>As this is only a small set, the build is fairly brief, taking about twenty minutes. There are few particularly noteworthy building techniques, although the attachment of the bars towards the back of the vehicle is very pleasing, accurately recreating the ribbed design we see in the films. Nevertheless, the construction is enjoyable until one reaches the inevitable attachment of sixty chain link pieces, which while dull, is unavoidable and only takes a few minutes.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>The model is very attractive when completed, and perfectly represents the &lsquo;real&rsquo; vehicle. As one would expect, the vehicle can roll on its central tread (and crush anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in its way), which is not so tight that it cannot move, but is not so loose that it will come off. The outriggers have a pleasing mix of smooth and studded surfaces, which allows for the attachment of a Battle Droid or two as we see in Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9023760338/"" title=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8537/9023760338_328fc77aca.jpg"" style=""height:358px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>The model also features some rather large cannons slung on either side of the tank, and of course the obligatory flick-fire missiles are included, which should provide some extra play value to the set. The &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; look superb in orange and are much more durable than they were on the 2009 set. Finally, the rear of the vehicles features the back wheel and the aforementioned ribbing, along with some trans-orange pieces which create the appearance of lights on the model.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9021544155/"" title=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5450/9021544155_6980898300.jpg"" style=""height:382px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>When compared with the 2009 edition, which was sold at the same price point as this set, but included an extra Minifigure, this model is actually far better. It is longer, taller and simply feels heavier and more substantial than the older model.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9023767390/"" title=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3710/9023767390_cf400087c8.jpg"" style=""height:463px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>I have yet to mention the glaring fact which is that this vehicle never actually appeared on Geonosis at the end of Episode II. This is a strange choice of model on the part of LEGO for this reason, although it was intended to appear, and you can see it in a couple of sequences which never made it into the final film during a documentary which accompany the DVD and Blu-Ray editions of the movie.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9023763794/"" title=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5324/9023763794_82f3060432.jpg"" style=""height:335px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>Anyway, ignoring this fact, this is certainly a set I would recommend as it is not only a huge step up from previous editions of this vehicle, but the Minifigure selection is excellent. Needless to say, Jango Fett is the star attraction and he alone is a pretty strong reason for purchasing this set, and if the Prequel Trilogy interests you at all, this is going to be a &lsquo;must have&rsquo; set for play or display.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Parts: 4 - Nothing too special here, although a nice mix of Technic and System pieces is welcome.</li>
	<li>Playability: 4 &ndash; Although lacking in features, this model is very durable and rolls around nicely.</li>
	<li>Building Experience: 3 &ndash; Brief, and not too interesting, particularly the construction of the tank treads.</li>
	<li>Value For Money: 5 &ndash; Three superb Minifigures and a nice chunky model to boot, no complaints here.</li>
	<li>Overall: 4.5 &ndash; Jango Fett alone earns this set a high mark, and I have no serious complaints.</li>

"hjmediastudios","2013-07-27T21:44:13Z","Attack of the Giant Snail","This is my second foray into the 2013 Battle of Geonosis sub-wave, with two Homing Spider Droids being my first purchases. Following up with two Tank Droids, I was eager to assemble the intimidating droid and pit it against my growing clone army. Sadly, I ended up being disappointed with the final set. Don't be too disheartened, though- this set is an excellent parts pack with some good minifigures.<br><h4><b>Pros</b></h4><ul><li><b>Army-Building Minifigs: </b>The minifigs in this set are fantastic. The standard Clone Trooper is nice to get for army-building, and the Battle Droid is similarly a good army-building figure. Note that this is a Geonosis battle droid, which for some reason is a darker orange color, the same as on the earlier <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemPic.asp?M=sw228"">Rocket Battle Droid</a>. My one qualm with the the new droid is that this wave doesn't really include a good number of battle droids; in fact, if you collect the entire Battle of Geonosis sub-wave, you'll end up with more super battle droids than their punier counterparts, which seems a bit odd. Nevertheless, both generic figures are good to have.</li><li><b>Jango Fett: </b>This guy is probably the reason a fair number of people will buy this set. Let me tell you, this is one of the best minifigs of the year- everything about Jango is perfect, from the metallic helmet and jetpack to the detailed printing. It might have been better if there had been two of the new Lone Ranger silver pistols instead of hose handles to represent Jango's blasters, but overall this is one intimidating bounty hunter. The overall appearance is very faithful to the film version, and fits in nicely alongside the recent Boba minifigure. <br></li><li><b>Parts Selection: </b>Another major draw for this set is the interesting parts selection. Chiefly, we get 60 track links, which I anticipate will be very useful for tank builders and military-MOC enthusiasts. We also get two large 10x10 dishes, which I can see being very useful for space builders as radar dishes or hull pieces. There are also six bars with an L-shaped end piece, which are intriguing and might be useful as part of a mech skeleton or similar construction. We get an assortment of other round pieces, slopes, and curved bricks, as well as a surprisingly robust stock of transparent orange elements. There are also a number of pneumatic T pieces, which are always good for greebling, robot joints, and other fiddly bits, including a load of Technic 1x2 bricks and a nice selection of 1x1 SNOT bricks.</li><li><b>The Price: </b>At 20 USD, this set is the cheapest of the summer 2013 wave, allowing you to pick up some muscle for your Separatist army without spending so much that you can't afford a couple of clones off Bricklink to round out your Battle of Geonosis. <br></li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li><b>The overall model: </b>Straight talk- the final model resembles nothing so much as a giant snail. A gun-laden, intimidating giant snail, but a snail nonetheless. It is, I suppose, accurate to the film vehicle, but it's hardly one of the more charismatic or striking vehicles in the Star Wars universe. The model also has a number of flaws that contribute to the general unappetizing nature of the build. For one, the guns are fixed in place, with no way to swivel them up and down, which might be nice for firing at something other than, say, the ankles of the new AT-TE, or blasting away at crawling clone troopers. The swivel feature of the laser cannons, though, seems to have been unwisely moved to the ""eyes""- the two camera-like appendages have a disturbing tendency to flop around on their pneumatic-T mount. Continuing the general level of mediocrity, the outriggers are mounted by a single Technic pin, and look like bizarre vestigial organs instead of functional pieces of machinery. Adding insult to injury, the outriggers are positioned right under the guns, making it impossible for Battle Droids to ride on the outriggers as they do in Episode III. <br></li><li><b>The build: </b>The building process is disappointing. There's no better way to put it- you essentially just build a repetitive sequence of stair-stepping SNOT bricks to created the ribbed effect on the back section, slap on a double dishes on the side, build two uninspired outriggers onto the aforementioned flimsy connection, and then spend a good chunk of time snapping together 60 track pieces. Granted, there's no way to avoid the tedious process of track assembly, but there are no interesting parts of the build to offset the humdrum boredom of popping one little link onto another to the point of tears.</li></ul><p>All in all, this is easily the worst set of the 2013 Summer Wave, by virtue of its dull build and bland final product. It is a great parts pack, though, and I know many people would buy it just for Jango, so in the end I reluctantly recommend the Corporate Alliance Tank Droid for purchase. You won't regret it, but you'll wish Lego had chosen something more interesting to go with the minifigs- perhaps a Hailfire droid (which is actually in the film; the Tank Droid appears only in extended bonus footage), a Geonsian cannon, or an arena beast might have been a more interesting inclusion.<br></p><br>",TRUE,3,5,1,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2013-12-22T11:28:22.57Z","New Jango, Great Build","<p><strong>Set #75015 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid: </strong>In the past few years I've noticed a trend with LEGO Star Wars sets, less Mini-Figures, higher prices the larger the set gets and an all around lack of anything truly original as re-make after re-make continues to be the norm. That being said this is a wonderful time to be a collector of LEGO Star Wars, there are a lot of great updates to previously poor interpretations of sets and the smaller price points are beginning to feature a lot of worthy Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>Here's my review of the Corporate Alliance Tank Droid from this year. A set that is really quite impressive for the 25$ price range.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>2013 Boxes feature Master Yoda, celebrating the Yoda Chronicles and matching up with Hasbro's short lived Clone Wars packaging as well. I have to wonder if Hasbro's packaging designers and LEGOs packaging designers have agreed to follow a similar pattern and Theme to make all Star Wars toy products uniform on the shelf?</p>
<p>Either way it's a great looking package design showing off the features of the set and the Mini-Figures quite nicely. The instructions will not be protected so there is the chance they could be mangled a bit, a slight chance, but a chance we all must take when collecting the smaller LEGO sets. I especially enjoy the checklist of LEGO sets and/or Mini-Figs that a lot of instruction booklets are receiving these past few years (sadly this one only has a checklist for the sets and not the figs), it helps to keep track of what you own and what you still need without always referring back to Brickset and it adds a bit more to the book that the kids can enjoy.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set features a lot of standard parts, Technic axles, half-pins and the like, typical bricks and tiles, nothing really stands out as unique from the assortment of parts. But there are a great many uses for them, and the tread-like pieces that build the central portion of the Tank Droid's mobility system are quite impressive. (And useful I'd wager for MOCing LEGO tanks)</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>There are three Mini-Figures in this set and really there's only one you're buying it for. That being said the other two are still pretty decent.</p>
<p>Clone Trooper with Phase 1 Armor and Helmet is your standard Clone seen in many sets. This one has a Blaster Rifle with Technic piece attached to beef up the look of the barrel turning it into a really powerful looking Blaster Rifle, perhaps a Sniper's tool to help take out the Tank Droid's treads from a distance. A decent troop builder addition for your clone army.</p>
<p>Battle Droid with Back Plate in dark reddish tones. This Mini-Figure is the standard Battle Droid only he's the Geonosian version, which is great because we don't see enough of those in modern LEGO sets and this is actually my first time owning one. I also like seeing a return of the Back Plate addition to the figure, since I also haven't seen that style in quite some time. Actually not since Naboo Swamp have I owned any others with the back plate. (Which helps to beef up the look of the Droid and avoids the spindly looking open torso look.) He includes a standard sized blaster as an accessory.</p>
<p>Jango Fett. This is the crowning glory of the Mini-Figures in this set, everybody wants a new Jango. He hasn't been seen since Attack of the Clones Slave 1 years ago and I never owned him back then either. This improved updated to the print detail and overall look of the character really stands out. His weapons unfortunately are a bit on the weaker side, I can understand wanting to match the look of his pistols from the movies, but I fail to understand why they wouldn't just use the small pistols we've seen before instead of the more common LEGO connector pieces which I don't really like using for weapons. (Mostly because of the hole in the hilt area, it just looks odd to see Mini-Figures wielding these as pistols or something.)</p>
<p>Other than that Jango is great and a welcome addition to the 2013 Mini-Figure collection, he also comes with the Rangefinder and other accessories for his helmet, there's a lot in this set and most of them will probably wind up going on Clone helmets at some point, still it's nice to get more of these awesome little accessories.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This set uses 2 numbered bags for the build, Bag 1 builds up the main body of the Tank Droid and the Mini-Figures. Bag 2 handles everything left over to complete the droid, which is a lot of smaller builds. Overall I really dig these huge buildable droids, much like the Hailfire Droid from 2008 or so this is a great combination of vehicle and large droid character to interact with Mini-Figures in scale.</p>
<p>My only real problem with the build is the eyestalk things, the droids eyes just never want to line up properly making them a bit of a nuissance. The rest of the build is suitably fun and doesn't take up too much time. Those eyes however could use a bit more work I think, an extra bit of stability on them to make sure they line up properly would work wonders.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>This Tank Droid is just powerful, that's all I have to describe him. He looks menacing, with some great use of parts, there are no stickers or printed details unfortunately. Still I'm not sure that's a deal breaker for some, the flick-fire missiles however might deter some collectors from enjoying this set.</p>
<p>I should also talk about how well it rolls, the tank treads move along at a very nice pace when on a hard flat surface, and you can hear it from a pretty fair distance so you'll know when the kids are playing with it. It's a really solid looking model and I quite enjoy it as a display piece.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall I'd say this set has some good points and a few minor nitpicks. Some people might have preferred getting a fourth Mini-Figure, perhaps another Clone or something to fight Jango and the Battle Droid. Some might think the build isn't for them, there are some collectors I'm sure who just do not like the Seperatists arsenal of Droid Vehicles.</p>
<p>Personally I find the set very engaging, quite a fun build to display, with some great Mini-Figures. Jango is also a much welcome addition to the Mini-Figure collection as it has been quite some time since we've seen one. (And this year we've gotten two.) I'd definitely recommend grabbing this set if you haven't already.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"wii1232","2014-04-22T02:16:28.68Z","Jango Whatt?","<p>This set definitely outwits the past 2, but there are some cons to this resurface.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was smaller than I expected, but made sense when the model was completed. &nbsp;The instruction booklet is as usual.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Shop.LEGO.com completely ripped me(and probably others) off due to the 60 tread pieces. &nbsp;That was sucky, &amp; could&#39;ve reduced the price if they were one long piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Arvo-FS, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Minifigures</span></p>

<p>The minifigures were not as they should be. &nbsp;LEGO should&#39;ve taken out Jango, &amp; put him in a new version of Slave I, because he was never in the Battle of Geonosis, in fact the Tank Droid itself never was even in the movie the box shows! &nbsp;Jango died in the arena when Mace Windu&nbsp;beheaded him(as we Star Wars fans know). &nbsp;So he doesn&#39;t deserve a place in this set. &nbsp;But I know for a fact that the battle droid &amp; clone trooper do.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building process only took about 15 minutes each, for I have 2 of these. &nbsp;So a total of 30 minutes, math geeks.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set is good, and can be used in a Battle of Kashyyyk&nbsp;scene, but not Geonosis. &nbsp;But the flick missiles are good, the detailing is great, the pontoons are good(except for the fact that&nbsp;they don&#39;t actually make the model float:), and the track tire/tread works greatly on carpet. &nbsp;Any hard surface and the track tire doesn&#39;t move very much. &nbsp;It does a little, but not much.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion on the matter is that on a scale of 1-10, I give this set an 8, due to the minor issues. &nbsp;I would recommend it, though. &nbsp;You could take a light-tan battle droid, &amp; make it sit on the left pontoon as seen in Episode III at the Battle of Kashyyyk.</p>
",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
"PooPotato","2014-03-23T22:02:29.01Z","Corporate Alliance Tank Droid: Great Quality & Price!","<p>I purchased this set simply to add to my Battle of Geonosis diorama, and the minifigures were a very welcome addition. &nbsp;Unlike most people, I am able to compare this model to its two previous versions.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>Same box theme as the other Summer Line sets, nothing special here.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>The parts are all fairly standard, along with the colors consisting of dark and light grey, the same as the other Episode II/III sets.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigures are clearly the highlight of this set, so I will put most attention towards them.</p>

<p>Jango Fett&nbsp;has to be the most popular fringe character in the Star Wars universe. &nbsp;Honestly he is nothing more than an under-qualified Boba&nbsp;Fett with shiny blue armor, but everybody still loves him. &nbsp;Looking past his rather unimportant character in the films, this minifigure is absolutely outstanding. &nbsp;He looks wonderful standing next to the Boba Fett&nbsp;minifig with 8097. &nbsp;His back is also printed, which is a very nice touch considering you probably will never see it.</p>

<p>The Clone Trooper is a standard infantryman, carrying the attempt at a DC-15 rifle with him. &nbsp;The rifle is taller than the minifig which is a bit comical. &nbsp;I personally like to use a black technic pin to simulate the barrel, but the trooper cannot hold the rifle with both hands, so this rendition&nbsp;will do. &nbsp;I should also note that a Clone Trooper Sergeant would have worked a lot better here than in 75000. &nbsp;It is now twice as hard to get an army of regular Phase I clones, with the other half of the army consisting of Sergeants...</p>

<p>The Geonosian Battle Droid is a great addition to this set, and goes wonderfully with the ones in 75019 AT-TE. &nbsp;This one has a back plate, which looks a lot better than the ones with 75019. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build is a mix of a structurally sound technic interior with a standard build for the pontoon skids. &nbsp;It didn&#39;t take me very long, with maybe 16 minutes of build time.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>Compared to the two previous editions of the Tank Droid in 7258 Wookiee Attack and 7748 Corporate Alliance Tank Droid, this one takes the cake indefinitely. &nbsp;The treads got caught 80% of the time in 7258, and the strange look and color of 7748 pales to this model. &nbsp;Of course this is far more accurate to the film than 7258, but this is excusable. &nbsp;One thing I should mention is that this vehicle only has a small appearance in the Battle of Kashyyyk&nbsp;in Episode III. &nbsp;It was supposed to be in Episode II, but I guess they cut it out for whatever reason.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Great Minifigs</p>

<p>Most film accurate out of all other versions</p>

<p>Awesome price</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Clone Sergeant should have come with this set, and vice versa.</p>

"Tar_Domo","2014-09-01T15:03:02.717Z","Jango Fett, finally, and the Geonosian Tank Droid","<p>The best thing in this set is Jango Fett. The Corporate Alliance Tank Droid is the one from The Battle of Geonosis. The earlier versions of it were the Kashyyyk version and the Clone Wars version.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box weight: 0.27kg, instructions good and easy to follow</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has a few exclusive parts, but not great parts for MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Jango Fett: Finally he is added in a set and not in a pricey one. Jango is cool though his pistols are some standard LEGO pieces used as guns. His helmet is cool and he has some printings.</p>

<p>Battle droid (Geonosian): From the droids color you can understand that it&acute;s a Geonosian version. It&acute;s a lot different than the old Battle Droid Geonosian but that&acute;s not too bad.</p>

<p>Clone Trooper: Nice add to the set. It&acute;s really welcome to my Clone Army.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was easy and fast so nothing special to say about it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed mode is good for display and has some play features.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Jango Fett is great and rest of the set is good also. I recommend for Episode 2 collectors.</p>

"Physoro","2015-01-19T03:45:45.79Z","Great Set!","<p>Although a pretty old set now (2013), I just got my hands on it and it&#39;s great!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Easy to follow, standard LEGO box art. However, strange that the box arts seems to place the tank droid in a sandy environment, Geonosis maybe? Personally, I only remember them from the battle on Kashyyyk.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not a very interesting array of colors or rare pieces to get from this set. The only piece exclusive to this set would be the giant grey disks that comprise the body of the tank (51373). Chain links are plentiful giving you 3 extras I believe. Other than that, not much to say for the pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are great, Jango Fett being the star of the set of course. He&#39;s a great figure with awesome printing. The color scheme is great and a much needed update on the original figure. Same pieces reprinted as Boba Fett minus the cape. He comes with two long pistol blasters, playing true to the movie. Also nice is that you get a Geonosis&nbsp;battle droid too, it comes in a dark orange which is pretty hard to come by nowadays. It also includes a phase 2 clone which is nice addition to the set, get some good guys in there.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty quick, not much challenge. But, of course the tedious part comes from the chain links which is pretty annoying seeing as there are sixty of them! It all comes together smoothly, but there is nothing of interest here.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think it looks amazing, much truer and larger than the old clone wars corporate alliance tank droid. It comes with two flick fire missiles, but in my opinion, if you just leave them there, I think they look great as guns with the pegs sticking out from the back of the gun. The set is pretty sturdy, it surprised me how well the gliding feet stay on despite only being held to the body with one technic pin. The feet glide nicely and can rotate and the big guns on the model look menacing. The &quot;eyes&quot; work nicely, but can be a little annoying when modeling it as they rotate as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

If you get the chance, I would definitely recommend picking this set up.</p>

"Studded_Dud","2020-09-06T23:11:03.567Z","I'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe","<p>Building Experience:</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much to say about the building experience for this set other than how most of the set is symmetrical. The last step is very annoying though, it is the step that connects all the chain pieces together. Connecting 60 of the same small piece isn&#39;t that fun to keep doing over and over again. Other than repetitiveness the building experience is just about the same as any other set.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>There are only a few pieces that stick out against the rest. There are two big radar dish pieces that form the sides of the tank which are only in this set. There are a bunch of antennas/visors which is usually the case even in sets like this where only one is actually used. There are some gear pieces to make the chain move, but other than that most of the pieces aren&#39;t anything special. This set includes 271 pieces.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>- Jango Fett:&nbsp; &nbsp; Jango Fett is the main focus point among the set. He has access points on both sides of his helmet for an antenna/visor. His helmet is designed to look just like the Mandalorian helmets do on screen. It is silver with blue and black printing to finish off the look. This helmet piece looks much better than the previous one which connected the helmet and the jetpack in one. His head is similar to his actor but it doesn&#39;t fully look like him. His head shows scars that the bounty hunter has acquired, it also shows a stubble beard over his smug bounty hunter face.&nbsp;The detail on Jango&#39;s torso looks exactly how it should. The precise detail continues to his feet. He holds two guns just like in the movie. The guns look accurate but it would have been nice if they could have used a piece that didn&#39;t have a hole in them.</p>

<p>- Clone Trooper:&nbsp; &nbsp; The Clone Trooper looks just like in the movie. The helmet also includes access points to a visor/antenna though he does not include one. The helmet looks superb and the printing finishes off the Clone look. The head underneath is the basic Clone Trooper head. The body shows great detail and looks just like the Clone Troopers do. The feet don&#39;t have any printing on them, but they have a black waist and white legs. The Clone&#39;s gun is made of two pieces, a long gun element and a technic pin. They look great together resembling a heavy-duty gun.</p>

<p>- Battle Droid:&nbsp; &nbsp; The Battle Droid from the battle of Geonosis looks great. It uses the basic Battle Droid head, body, arms, and feet. The only thing that is different is the color. It has been changed to match how the Droids look during the battle of Geonosis. This Droid carries a regular blaster piece.</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>The build in this set is a Corporate Alliance Tank Droid, just like the name of the set. It looks pretty close to how it appears on screen. It has few points of movement. The chain in the middle moves what ever way that it is pushed, and the lights on the top&nbsp;move up and down. The two legs can move up and down as well. The cannons are suck in one position which makes sense, but they do include a flick fire missile on each side for play purposes.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>Overall this set is pretty accurate and shows great value at an original price of&nbsp;&pound;19.99/$19.99, while&nbsp;including&nbsp;271 pieces. It is a great army builder if you don&#39;t mind having a bunch of Jango Fett. In the end this is a must-have for any Star Wars fan!</p>

"CommanderCody05","2022-11-20T01:16:28.95Z","10 Years Later....","<p>This is a set I recently bought at mom-and-pop lego store for 25 dollars and I could not resist getting it. As a little warning, it did not come with figures so will have to review them from pictures.</p>

<p>MINIFIGUES: First off is Jango Fett, whom the clones are &quot;cloned&quot; after. His blue madalorian armour is very close in line with the film. He has jetpack that is cast in silver and has 2 pistols in the same colour. Underneath the helmet is a scared face with a stubble. Next is the clone, who has had the first update since the cartoon versions. He has no leg printings and the armour looks very smashing. His helmet is by far more accurate than the previous generations, with distinct lines and proper vent printings. Lastly is the Geonosis battle droid. It is the first time ever it has been made in this colour. It also has a 2 by 1 plate on its back which prevents him from falling over when his gun and arm is extended. I wish Lego would go back to using these.</p>

<p>BUILD: The build itself is very aesthetically pleasing. The construction process has various technic parts and the worse part is building the tracks. It does have any stickers and has lasted for ten years so far.</p>

<p>SUMMARY: This version of the Corporate Alliance Tank is the best in my opinion. It has been a front row display piece, and it is nicely paired with the AT-TE I bought a few months ago.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
