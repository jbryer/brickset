"hjmediastudios","2013-07-21T17:29:48.353Z","Fear Incarnate on Four Semi-Movable Legs!","<p>I picked up two of these Homing Spider Droids from a local bookstore recently. After building them, I'm pleasantly surprised with the set, although there are several aspects of the set that I'd prefer to see changed. With that said, here's a list of the ups and down of Set 75016.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li><b>Stass Allie</b>- This is a really well-done minifigure, and if I'm not mistaken she's the first female minifigure with a skin tone other than peach. Her headdress is superb; although it is a hard rubber element, it's nicely detailed and fits in snugly with the minifig head. The torso is (as is standard these days) double-sided, as is the head. Overall, it's a well-done figure, although not a particularly recognizable or exciting one.<br></li><li><b>The Homing Spider Droid's Overall Appearance: </b>Whatever one may think of the Prequel Trilogy, it must be admitted that it contains some of the more terrifying constructs of the entire Star Wars universe. The finished droid model is surprisingly large, especially given the smaller box- I can easily imagine horrified minifigs fleeing in terror. The main sphere is well-done, and the guns are both film-accurate.</li><li><b>Bonus Trooper</b>: The standard clone trooper included is a nice touch- he's the same as the others from 2013, though. A good figure, and one that I can imagine many people army-building with, so it's a good move on TLG's part to include him.</li><li><b>Dwarf Spider Droid:</b> A nice extra addition to your Separatist forces. This one is similar to the earlier design in the Hailfire Droid and Spider Droid set, although it does have a sturdier, more stable leg design.</li><li><b>Parts Selection</b>: If you're a fan of Technic pieces, curved bricks, and little fiddly bits, this set delivers. Virtually every piece in the set is ripe with MOC'ing potential. Some of the more notable pieces are the new 6x6 round plates, a slew of quarter-dome and half-arch rounded bricks, and a decent helping of the new-ish 1x2 plate with an axle hole protrusion.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li><b>Stass Allie</b>: I can't help but feel that Stass Allie is just a little too much of a fringe character to be made into a minifigure. She's great; don't get me wrong, but I would have preferred a clone Lieutenant or perhaps some sort of specialist droid instead of a fairly generic Jedi.<br></li><li><b>The</b> <b>Spider Droid's Play Features:</b> The biggest thing that bothers me about this set is that the guns on the large droid don't move. They're pretty much fixed in place, although the bottom gun does click-hinge its way up and down. The legs also lack poseability, although they are sturdy and can hold up to solid play.<b> </b><br></li></ul>
<p>All in all, it's a good set. I wouldn't say it's loaded with play value, as it's essentially just two droids a some minifigs, but it does work well to army-build on a larger scale and provides a robust value for the price. I may pick up one or two more, as they're the closest thing we're seeing in 2013 to a Separatist ""big gun"" vehicle.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,2,3,5
"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2014-01-27T23:30:41.037Z","A lovely set. And Stass Allie is a nice inclusion","I recently received this set for my birthday, and what a set it is. Given licenseflation (which is when a licensed LEGO set costs more than a non-licensed set of the same size/weight) and such, it's not a bad value for thirty U.S. dollars.<br><br>This set comes with four minifigures, both of the human ones well-printed:<br><ul><li>2 Super Battle Droids</li><li>1 Clone Trooper in Phase 1 armor</li><li>Stass Allie!</li></ul>The trooper and droids are good for army-building, naturally, but it's the Thlolothian Jedi Master Stass Allie who's the star attraction here. She's a welcome addition to the Jedi ranks, giving us one more movie character. Fun fact: They were originally going to have the figure be Stass Allie's cousin Adi Gallia, but changed that when they were reminded that it's Stass seen in the Battle of Geonosis in AOTC, not Adi. The figure can still serve as Adi, however, if you swap the lightsaber blade for a blue one (and, for preference, grab gray Jedi robes). Which is good news for fans of Star Wars: Jedi Starfighter, and a reason to buy two of this set. And if you buy more than two, Thlolothians are now on the species it's possible to do mix-and-match minifigure making for, and your population can be more ethnically diverse.<br><br>The other thing of note is the Clone Trooper; they've changed which piece they're using to make the rifle look more like a DC-15. Instead of just a regular pin, it's a pin-with-axle-socket piece. This was done due to the use of a pin not exactly being good for the pin's health. It's not the best choice they could make, though; a black one of the newer-design axle-to-axle connector pieces would do the job better.<br><br>The Homing Spider Droid itself stands nice and tall, as it should. The central sphere has improved from the previous outing; a Technic motorcycle wheel is used to supply axle and pin connection ports to the sides while keeping the middle round. The top and bottom sections use relatively new large dome-quarter and curved bricks to perfectly capture the spherical look, and the droid has its proper 3 photoreceptors. The guns are better looking, and perhaps a tiny bit sturdier. The top cannon is on a flick-missile piece. LEGO probably got the idea for this kind of thing from Hasbro. It's not too bad, though. And it's loaded into a steady piece, so you can fire it without trouble. As far as the legs go, they're mostly the same design as in ""Separatist Spider Droid"" but with a few tweaks detail-wise. They serve well, although it's best to have them all spread fully out in the Homing Spider Droid's signature stance.<br><br>Also included is a nice Dwarf Spider Droid. It's small-ish compared to the ones from ""Wookiee Attack"", and ""Hailfire Droid and Spider Droid"", basically being a gray-ified version of the latter with smaller, more stable legs. However, the piece used for the antenna is an iffy choice; a flagpole piece would have been more the ticket. It's overall alright, though I kind of prefer the design of the one from ""Wookiee Attack"" due to it having a dome central body instead of a spherical one; in that respect it's more film-accurate. Even so, this one is nice to have.<br><br>Overall, a very nice set. The minifigs are welcome (especially Stass Allie), the Dwarf Spider Droid is a nice bonus, and the main event is a towering armed terror perfect for giving your droid army that extra edge. Get it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"wii1232","2014-04-23T00:45:28.313Z","Bad Guns, but a great Battle of Geonosis edition!","<p>This set I spent on with my own money, and it&#39;s a good one if you are a Battle of Geonosis collector.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was smaller than I thought it would be, but it made sense after I compared it to the size of the completed model. &nbsp;The instructions were good.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are mostly dark gray and light bluish-gray, aside from the few black, tan, white, &amp; semi-translucent red ones, which are a common colors used for Star Wars sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are good. &nbsp;The new 2013 variant of a Clone Trooper, &amp; the 2013 variant of super battle droids, &amp; the all-new Jedi Knight Stass Allie.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build did not take long, only about 30 minutes. &nbsp;The dwarf spider droid about 5 minutes, and the homing spider droid about 25. &nbsp;The minifigs don&#39;t matter. &nbsp;Although it&#39;s quite easy to make, I think the hardest part would be the legs.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The only con about the completed model is that the laser cannons on the momma droid(homing spider droid) don&#39;t turn. &nbsp;Although the top can still be fired &amp; the bottom bent up &amp; down, they don&#39;t rotate. &nbsp;Also the legs are really loose and unposeable, unless you position it a certain way. &nbsp;It&#39;s not really a big deal, but it would make this set have a 5 rating. &nbsp;But the rotating dome, minifigures, translucent piece for the dwarf spider droid &amp; photoreceptors make this set a 4 star.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion on this set is that it is a great set to have if you are a Battle of Geonosis collector. &nbsp;I would recommend it to them. &nbsp;It will also add to your droid army and can be used in other &quot;for fun&quot; battles.</p>

"PooPotato","2014-03-27T03:40:01.293Z","Separatist Firepower!","<p>This is the set that started my 2013 Episode II buying craze, and I have to say this is the set I would have wanted to start with. &nbsp;The Homing Spider Droid made it&#39;s first appearance in Episode II, and it just strikes fear into you when you realize how massive these things are supposed to be. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box, like all of the other 2013 Summer line sets was very unique. &nbsp;It was very narrow and long, which made it stand out on the shelf from all of the other sets. &nbsp;The instructions were flat surprisingly, and I had no issue in reading them.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>People who scavenge for technic parts should definitely buy this set, as a majority of the building involves the four legs and their connections. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>Although only one of these minifigs was new for me, I was overall happy with the selection.</p>

<p>Stass Allie is the new minifigure here, and it was a great decision to put her in here. &nbsp;She has a double printed torso, a green lightsaber, and a rubberized head piece that represents her head-dress. &nbsp;I only remember seeing her once in the films, and that was in Episode III when she was shot off of her speeder bike during Order 66 on Saleucami. &nbsp;Considering that there is a set called &#39;Battle on Saleucami&#39;, it might be a good idea to pick one of those up with this set as well.</p>

<p>The Clone Trooper is a standard infantryman, and is nothing new. &nbsp;He comes with the DC-15A&nbsp;Blaster Rifle, and has the same scowl as all of the other Troopers.</p>

<p>The two Super Battle Droids&nbsp;are definitely not new to me, but are a nice addition considering that the SBD makes it&#39;s first appearance in the Battle of Geonosis.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build did not take me long at all, maybe 15 minutes at the most. &nbsp;It was very repetitive, considering that the Homing Spider Droid and the Dwarf Spider Droid each have four legs. &nbsp;If you want a challenging and complex build, this is probably not the best set for you.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The model looks outstanding next to my other Battle of Geonosis sets, especially against the &nbsp; &nbsp; AT-TE. &nbsp;The Dwarf Spider droid also has it&#39;s 3rd appearance I believe, as I own the previous two.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Overall this model is very good. &nbsp;The 2 cannons are very film accurate, although the bottom one would have been better if it had the ability to swivel. &nbsp;You not only get the Homing Spider Droid and four&nbsp;</span>minifigs<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">, you also get a Dwarf Spider Droid, which looks fantastic standing under it&#39;s larger cousin. &nbsp;One thing that I have to say about this model is that it only has 1 good position for it to stand correctly. &nbsp;If you try changing it&#39;s legs around it just folds up like a dead Daddy Long Leg, and it is especially hard to balance it on wood furniture. &nbsp;If you can get it to stand correctly, it does look rather menacing, and would look great with 2 or 3 more next to it (if you have the room for that).</span></p>

<p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Great minifigs</p>

<p>Dwarf Spider Droid and Homing Spider Droid</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Hard to balance on table</p>

<p>Price a little steep</p>

<p>Repetitive build</p>
