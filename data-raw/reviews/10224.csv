<p>In my second review of the Summer 2013 LEGO Star Wars sets I will be taking a look at <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=75017-1"">75017</a> Duel on Geonosis. Priced at a (surprisingly) reasonable &pound;39.99 or $39.99 and boasting 391 pieces, this is one of the mid-sized sets of the selection this Summer, and I am rather impressed with it.</p>

<p>Naturally, being a set based on a scene from&nbsp;the Prequel Trilogy, the appeal of this model&nbsp;is limited. Nevertheless, I have found it to be a very enjoyable set, much more so than I had initially anticipated. The actual Geonosian&nbsp;hangar is not at all bad, including plenty of play features and a smattering of details which are most welcome.</p>

<p>What really makes this set for me however, as with most Star Wars sets in fact&nbsp;are the Minifigures,&nbsp;which are about as good as you can get in my opinion. Much like set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75015-1"">75015</a> Corporate Alliance Tank Droid&nbsp;there are stand out Minifigures which make the set particularly desirable, those being Yoda and Count Dooku, who have both&nbsp;been in dire need of an update since 2002 (excluding Clone Wars editions of the characters).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>The box is exactly the size one would expect for a set at this price point and features an action-packed shot of Yoda and Count Dooku in the midst of a Lightsaber&nbsp;duel. As with all 2013 Star Wars sets the lovely green border is featured along with a shot of Yoda diving into battle. Along the bottom of the box we also get the usual Minifigure gallery, complete with all four Minifigures, each of whom is appropriately labelled as &#39;new.&#39;</p>

<p>The back of the box displays all of the features and shows off Count Dooku&#39;s Flitknot&nbsp;Speeder bike, as well as giving us a couple of images of the characters in action much like we see them in the films, although a certain amount of artistic license is employed here.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9040620947/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/9040620947_e3f554e18f.jpg"" style=""height:336px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>There is only need of a single instruction booklet, and construction is split into three numbered bags, with the inclusion of one large 6 x 16 tile loose in the box. No stickers are included in this set. Interestingly, the instruction booklet is made of a similarly good quality paper as found in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9496-1"">9496</a> Desert Skiff last year, with a rather nice gloss to each page.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Four Minifigures are included in this set, each of whom is new as I previously mentioned. Perhaps the most anticipated of these has been the updated&nbsp;<strong>Yoda</strong> Minifigure, who is just about flawless. His head mould is brand new and elaborately printed with some highly detailed eyes and a patch of wispy grey hair on the back of his head. The entire component is made from a slightly rubberized plastic cast in olive green, and his ears are slightly flexible because of this. The torso is very similar to that included in set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75002-1"">75002</a> AT-RT for the most recent Clone Wars edition of Yoda, although some changes have been made. The folds in the fabric for instance are much finer than previously and look more realistic, as does the addition of some green flesh around his neck. The back of the torso is also printed with a hood and plenty more creases. As with every Yoda Minifigure, the character utilises&nbsp;short legs which are not poseable, but they look perfect. Of course, he also includes his green Lightsaber.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9042980894/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3678/9042980894_67fdaeb698.jpg"" style=""height:500px; width:484px"" /></a></p>

<p>This Minifigure is by far the best edition of the character we have yet seen, and the detail included is extraordinary. I highly doubt a better Yoda Minifigure will be released than this one for some years&nbsp;to come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second Minifigure is the <strong>FA-4 Pilot Droid</strong>. This is a character which need not have been included;&nbsp;however I am very pleased that LEGO chose to do so. His head is the same mould as that of the Commando Droid Minifigures, but is printed quite differently in order to capture the look of the droid in the film, which I think is achieved quite accurately. While his upper body is a mixture of dark bluish grey and dark brown droid components, the lower half consists of a few LEGO System parts which recreate the treads on the droid in the film. All in all, this is another superb Minifigure, albeit not a particularly interesting character.</p>

<p>Next we have the Geonosian&nbsp;<strong>Poggle the Lesser</strong>. As the Archduke of Geonosis and perhaps the most prevalent Separatist leader other than Nute Gunray and Count Dooku this is a Minifigure which I am actually very impressed with and to have the character in LEGO is excellent. His head is a brand new mould and is highly detailed with a rather regal crest and his wattles both being particularly accurate to Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones. The dark tan piece is printed with some black and tan highlights, and much like Yoda, the piece is slightly rubbery.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9040603771/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3773/9040603771_506e7684b0.jpg"" style=""height:391px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>He includes the same plastic wings as found in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9491-1"">9491</a> Geonosian Cannon on Geonosians from that set and his torso is printed with a great deal of detail on the front and back, including the various gemstones and chains which are visible being worn by Poggle the Lesser in the film. His legs and hips too are printed with metallic armour which is as detailed as the torso. He comes with two accessories, a reddish brown cane (which is supposedly made from the bones of a political rival in the movie) and a small orange hologram showing a plan of the Death Star. I much prefer the piece included in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8039-1"">8039</a> Venator Class Republic Attack Cruiser, on which the printing of the Death Star was much clearer. However, the inclusion of the accessory is very welcome. As you can see in the image below, he looks excellent heading up a group of Geonosian Warriors, and although they are actually based on the Clone Wars, they nevertheless match up very nicely with their leader Poggle.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9040573217/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3779/9040573217_28ec3e0067.jpg"" style=""height:368px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>Finally, we have the nefarious <strong>Count Dooku</strong>. I am delighted with this Minifigure, and in a completely unexpected turn for me, this is in fact one of the best Minifigures of the last year or two&nbsp;in my opinion as the character in the film is brilliantly captured by the LEGO version. His hairpiece is perfect for Count Dooku and it looks wonderful in white to me. The head is printed on both sides with two different expressions, one of anger (which looks very evil indeed) and the other fairly neutral. There are plenty of little wrinkles on each side, as well as a realistic mixture of white, grey and black for his facial hair.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9042818046/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7312/9042818046_509cd1e804.jpg"" style=""float:left; height:236px; margin:0px 10px 5px 0px; width:260px"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9040589977/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7365/9040589977_42d0925da0.jpg"" style=""height:236px; width:288px"" /></a></p>

<p>He wears a standard brown cape and his torso is accurate with a rather nice chain to keep his cape on. He also has a rather nice belt with some pouches and a few creases here and there. Unfortunately there is no back printing but the cape obscures this regardless, so it is of no consequence really. His legs are plain black and he carries his unique curved Lightsaber which looks fantastic as always, as well as some force lightning which is nice to see.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>This set is very easy to build, and lacks any particularly interesting moments. The manner in which the impressive Geonosian architecture is recreated using arched bricks is impressive, but other than that there is little of note that I can find. The build takes about forty&nbsp;minutes and is enjoyable if you prefer building with standard System pieces, although for Technic fans there are other Star Wars sets which offer far more from the perspective of an entertaining construction phase.</p>

<p>I did in fact spot a very minor error in the instruction manual, or in the box photography depending on how you look at it. The small triangular fins towards the rear of the Flitknot Speeder are attached the opposite way round in the instructions to how they are on the box. Personally, I prefer the attachment of them as shown in the instruction manual (which is what you can see in&nbsp;the photos below of the completed model) which also seems a little more accurate compared with the vehicle in the film.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>As a playset, the actual model is not particularly accurate or impressive for display;&nbsp;however&nbsp;there are plenty of features and lots of fun to be had with the model. As I mentioned a little earlier on, Count Dooku&#39;s Flitknot Speeder is included which is rather nice, being very durable and therefore swooshable. The bodywork looks superb, and Count Dooku can sit down at the front holding on to the handlebars with his cape either pushed up over the body of the speeder, or folded behind his back, neither of which damage the cape as long as he is not left sitting there for days on end.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9042745938/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3667/9042745938_c94768e1e3.jpg"" style=""height:268px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>The actual hangar contains some nice features, including flick fire pieces of scenery to recreate the brief force duel which takes place between Dooku and Yoda in Episode II. We also have a box in which you can store the Death Star plans or Count Dooku&#39;s force lightning if you would prefer, which is hidden behind a rock. Next we have the collapsing column which comes close to killing Obi-Wan and Anakin but for the timely intervention of Yoda. By pushing the grey lever beside the tower one can control to what extent it collapses as if Yoda is using the force to catch it as in the film. Also, and somewhat bizarrely if you ask me, there is a small button at the back of the model which can be pushed to launch a section of rock from the wall. This is a slightly superfluous feature but it takes nothing away from the appearance of the model and is therefore welcome in my opinion.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9040555639/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7419/9040555639_81ceba97a0.jpg"" style=""height:375px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>Lastly when it comes to features, and perhaps most interestingly of all, a rather long pole is included which can be connected to Yoda&#39;s back using a neck bracket, allowing you to recreate Yoda jumping around the room as he duels with Count Dooku. These are all fun features if you prefer to play with your sets, although for display this set is lacking in my opinion.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9042761576/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7443/9042761576_deb6e9a343.jpg"" style=""height:382px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>There are also some nice details such as the landing platform outside (which lines up nicely with the Republic Gunship&nbsp;by the way to recreate the dropping off of Anakin and Obi-Wan), a chandelier style light fitting over the large archway door, and some nice piping details which &nbsp;add to the industrial appearance of the hangar. The architectural styling of the model is in fact rather attractive&nbsp;and very reminiscent of Geonosian&nbsp;architecture from Episode II.&nbsp;The entire set can fold up to form either an expansive play area, or a more realistic and densely detailed recreation of the hangar in which this&nbsp;scene takes place.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9042784182/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7445/9042784182_9850ff6655.jpg"" style=""height:373px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>I have mixed feelings about this set in many ways. Although the Minifigures are beyond reproach in my opinion, being just about perfect, the detail is somewhat&nbsp;lacking in the model itself. For play this is a superb model with loads of excellent features and of course everything required to recreate one of my favourite Lightsaber duels of all six films, between Yoda and Count Dooku. Perhaps&nbsp;Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi&nbsp;might have been included to truly complete the set, although I think that this is a somewhat unreasonable expectation however as they both come in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75021-1"">75021</a> Republic Gunship and we already have an excellent Minifigure selection in my opinion.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9040534207/"" title=""75017 Duel on Geonosis by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75017 Duel on Geonosis"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/9040534207_1796458b9b.jpg"" style=""height:294px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>In the simplest of terms, the Minifigures are &#39;must haves&#39; if you ask me, and if you are looking for a set with play value then this is among the best of this wave. However, for display alone, the set is lacking in the &#39;wow factor&#39; which one finds with other sets sometimes, and there are certainly others from this wave which are better suited for display.</p>

<p>Parts: 3&nbsp;- Plenty of brilliant&nbsp;parts for the Minifigures, although nothing of universal usefulness as far as I can see.</p>

<p>Playability: 5 - This is where the set shines, numerous&nbsp;features and the Minifigures make this a very enjoyable set.</p>

<p>Building Experience: 3.5&nbsp;- Nothing much of note really, but certainly not a repetitive build at any point.</p>

<p>Value for Money: 5 - You get plenty of parts for your money and the Minifigures are well worth the price.</p>

<p>Overall: 4 - Not an iconic set by any means, but the Minifigures are well worth purchasing at the very least.</p>

"wii1232","2013-10-16T13:50:17.847Z","LOTS of Details!","<p>This is a set that I bought with my own allowance money a few days ago.&nbsp; I expected the box to be a little bigger, but it looked a pretty good size.</p>
<p>When I saw who the minifigures were on the box, I knew who they were before I got the set, it's just that I didn't know if ALL of them were new; which they were.&nbsp; Count Dooku came with a red-bladed lightsaber with a chrome and curved hilt, and Sith Lightning.&nbsp; Yoda came with a green-bladed lightsaber.&nbsp; Poggle the Lesser came with a walking stick and a hologram of the Death Star Design.&nbsp; And Dooku's Pilot Droid comes with no equipment.&nbsp; I really think that Anakin and Obi-Wan should have come with it as well, so I don't have to get the expensive Republic Gunship to get them.&nbsp; So, it looks as if I'll have to wait another month for my birthday.</p>
<p>Anyway, the set has LOTS of features.&nbsp; Dooku has a swoop bike to make a quick getaway.&nbsp; Also, as seen in the movie, there are some brown parts and lights that can be pushed out, as if he is using the force to move them towards Yoda.&nbsp; Also, the tower thing that Dooku collapses to get away in his solar sailor(even though it doesn't come with the set) can be pushed over.&nbsp; And probably the best feature in MY opinion is that you can attatch Yoda to a stick thingy that you can use to bounce him around everywhere, as he does in the movie.&nbsp; It's my favorite feature.</p>
<p>This was TOTALLY worth the price!&nbsp; It goes with the story, a lot!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"PooPotato","2014-03-24T02:31:41.8Z","Duel on Geonosis","<p>If you have read any of my other reviews, you may have learned by now that a lot of my purchases were driven by missed opportunities from my childhood, and this is in fact one of them. &nbsp;I recall staring at 7103 Jedi Duel on the shelf at Walmart, wishing I had that four dollars of allowance to get it before it went away... &nbsp;I missed most of the Episode II sets, so after waiting 11 years I frantically bought every one (besides 75021 Republic Gunship, that one&#39;s next!), and this one was the last one I purchased from the Summer Episode II line. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was a very unique shape, and had the familiar Yoda artwork in the corner. &nbsp;The instructions were rolled up pretty badly, but they were easy enough to read once I flattened them out.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A majority of the parts in this set are dark/light grey and brown. &nbsp;One piece I&#39;ve never seen before was the big flat tile used for the landing area. &nbsp;This is where the Republic Gunship drops off Obi Wan and Anakin to fight Dooku after chasing him over the sandy plains of Geonosis. &nbsp;I imagine this set would go REALLY well with 75021, I guess I&#39;ll find out!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set is chock-full of new minifigs, and each one is remarkable in my eyes.</p>

<p>Count Dooku is probably my favorite minifig out of all of the ones included with this model. &nbsp;His curved lightsaber hilt is perfect, and is even made out of the chrome plastic that every lightsaber hilt was made of back in the day. &nbsp;His hair and facial expressions are spot on, and he comes with a dark brown cape. &nbsp;This is the 3rd time he has appeared as a minifigure, but only the 2nd time excluding the Clone Wars.</p>

<p>Yoda has been waiting years to be re-done, and boy did they do it right! &nbsp;Instead of the sand green eyeless Yoda that was last included in 7260 Wookiee&nbsp;Catamaran, you get a highly detailed olive green Yoda, complete with wispy grey hair and eyes. &nbsp;This is a major step up from the Clone Wars version and the 7260 one, and looks great next to the 41st Elite Corps Scouts from 75305. &nbsp;With Commander Gree it would be possible to re-create the botched Order 66 attempt on Yoda, although he doesn&#39;t come with his cape.</p>

<p>Poggle&nbsp;the Lesser is a very interesting minifig in that he actually matches with the Clone Wars styled Geonosians. &nbsp;Luckily the Geonosians from the Clone Wars line weren&#39;t completely cartoonified and ended up resembling their film counterparts. &nbsp;Poggle comes with his cane, which was made out of the bones of his political enemies, and a Death Star prototype holocron. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The FA-4 Pilot Droid seems a little out of place, considering Count Dooku&#39;s&nbsp;Solar Sailer was not included in this line, but nonetheless is nice inclusion and is very accurate to it&#39;s brief appearance in the film. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very enjoyable for this set. &nbsp;The Geonosian architecture is captured very well, and there are many movie accurate details. &nbsp;The big spire that Dooku&nbsp;tries to crush Obi Wan and Anakin with is included, and further shows that 75021 would go wonderfully with this set. &nbsp;Dooku&#39;s speeder bike is also included, and is the correct shade of brown (why the other one was sand blue is beyond me).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks a bit awkward when placed next to some of the other Episode II sets from the 2013 Summer Line, but when placed in the back right corner of my Geonosis diorama it looks pretty good. &nbsp;Whether I&#39;ll have enough room for a Republic Gunship is a big question, and I might just have to move this set to make room...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set&#39;s playability is off the wall, and the minifigs are to die for. &nbsp;The price is a little steep, but if you can get past that it&#39;s a great set.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>4 awesome minifigs</p>

<p>Tons of playability</p>

<p>Would pair well with 75021</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Price is a little high</p>

"VaderFan2187","2016-09-22T20:06:40.5Z","Duel on Geonosis ","<p>First off, let me just say that autocorrect doesn&#39;t recognize Geonosis as a word. It keeps trying to change it to Genesis. Very annoying. Anyway, let&#39;s get into the set! Priced at $39.99 and with four minifigures, three of which are currently exclusive, this set is based on the Episode II scene where Yoda saves Obi-Wan and Anakin by concentrating hard to stop the collapsing pillar (size matters not, eh?)</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>The box looks good, and is rather large. The instructions were clear and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are okay. You do get a large 8x16 dark stone grey tile, and 4 brown rock pieces, but there&#39;s not much in this set if you want it for parts&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are great! Yoda is more detailed than the 2002 one, and he currently appears in Homing Spider Droid as well, but somehow... he doesn&#39;t look old. He comes with a green lightsaber, which somehow, I only have one of. Dooku looks superb. His serious face looks more like the late Sir Christopher Lee than his evil grin face. I like the lightning piece and curved hilt included. Poggle the Lesser is cool too. And DEATH STAR PLANS!&iexcl;!&iexcl;! The Pilot Droid is average, but he does come with a new head.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is divided into three bags, the first of which is unnecessarily small. There weren&#39;t particularly any &quot;wow&quot; moments, but it was still a decent build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Dooku&#39;s flitknot speeder is great. The collapsing pillar is good. The Yoda flying play feature is.... lame. This set looks large enough for the price, compared to the $49.99 Battle on Takodana this year. The flick missiles and shooting rock are quite cool too.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set! It&#39;s pretty cool, but my favorite piece has to be the Death Star plans hologram included.</p>
