"Paragon132","2014-07-28T00:41:36.567Z","Great set, but a bit high on the price side...","<p>I bought this set on a whim on amazon, discounted 15 dollars off. I wasn&#39;t sure about it at the time, but it turned out to be a pretty decent purchase!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty big, as it would be for 70 dollars, and it comes with 2 fairly large instruction booklets. The back of the box depicts Jek knocking the Special forces Clone off his butt, while the astromech droid and the bounty hunter watch in awe. It also shows key functions of the Stealth fighter (or E-wing) like folding wings, rotating turret and the cockpit.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set includes a large amount of black and red pieces, so if you want to build something with those colors, this is your set. There is also a bunch of pretty nice, somewhat new peices included as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are really what makes the set. You get a total of 3 (4 if you count the astromech) and they&#39;re all really great. Jek-14: This is such an interesting minifigure. First off, he&#39;s got a great print all around. His first face is him smiling with his blue eyes, and his other face is him force charged with his force lightning. He&#39;s wearing what appears to be a variation of clone armor. He&#39;s also the first minifigure to have a translucent body part, which looks really great. Finally, he&#39;s got a lightsaber with a new white hilt, which people will love for moc making. (Due to the extra peices, you get two!) Special Forces Clone: yet another great looking minifigure. He&#39;s wearing phase 3 clone armor in bue, and on his shoulder he has a white cloth pauldron with blue stripes. He has a standard blaster and a translucent blue shield. He also has a regular clone face. Separatist Bounty Hunter: Not a whole lot so see here but nonetheless a great minifigure. His helmet is what really makes it- boba fett&#39;s new helmet mold with a different print that looks great. His face is the same as the republic trooper from the Republic striker class starfighter. He also has a regular sniper rifle. Last but not least is the Astromech Droid: He&#39;s got the variation of droid heads, a more cylindrical head rather than the dome. He is colored red, white and gray.<br />

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was rather interesting, and didn&#39;t really get repetitive, so it was pretty enjoyable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model came out bigger and heavier than i thought it would be. The function looks and works great. The flick missile funchtion works better than i thought, and the turret swivels all the way around. The cargo trunk in the back isn&#39;t tha huge, but the tray with the holocron fits fine. Also, with the panels on the side, above the wing pistons, there is enough room to fit his lightsaber pretty tightly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this is a much better set than I expected. I know people are mostly going to be buying this for the minifigs, and 70 dollars is a bit much for a 550 peice set. Nowadays, you can usually find it on sale on amazon (last time I checked it was down ten dollars) or some retail stores. So, overall this is a pretty great set that I would recommend to any star wars or lego fan, even though it doesn&#39;t really fit in, but if you want a black and red E-wing, or just a good set, this is for you.</p>
