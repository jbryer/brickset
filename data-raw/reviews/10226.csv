<p>In the midst of the excitement (and dread) surrounding the Comic Con exclusives which plague LEGO every year, allow me to bring you a little light relief in the form of a review. It has been far too long since my last Star Wars review,&nbsp;over a month in fact,&nbsp;and now that I am back from my cruise around the Baltic, which was excellent, I can sit back and continue my documentation of this Summer&#39;s Star Wars sets.</p>

<p>This Summer, Star Wars sets can be split into two entirely different groups. There are five Battle of Geonosis sets, and five from elsewhere within the films and the Clone Wars television show. The second largest of the Battle of Geonosis sets is the seemingly ever-present AT-TE, now in its third outing at Minifigure scale. Therefore this set, much like many others from this wave, is simply an updated version of a previous model, and no doubt it improves vastly on earlier editions.</p>

<p>The AT-TE played a fairly significant role in Star Wars Episode II, and is certainly not one of those &#39;blink and you miss it&#39; vehicles unlike some others I could think of (most notably the B-Wing, which now has as many models made of it as seconds it was in the film). This particular edition, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=75019-1"">75019</a> AT-TE, has a slightly inflated price,&nbsp;in the UK at least,&nbsp;over the last incarnation, costing &pound;79.99 or $89.99. The US price has remained the same while the piece count has gone down by a grand total of four parts from the 2008 edition, to 794 pieces. While not initially struck on this set, due to the fact that it is rather more stubby than earlier AT-TE models, I am fairly impressed with this set, and beside its older counterparts, this one is far superior in my opinion. Add five excellent Minifigures to the mix and one has the makings for a great Star Wars set.</p>

<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>The box for this set is an entirely unique shape as far as I can tell, being over twice as wide as it is tall. The front of the box shows the AT-TE in action on Geonosis while the Jedi cut down swathes of Battle Droids on the ground. As usual, the green border is present and&nbsp;a gallery of the five Minifigures is included on the box. Needless to say, many of the features are documented on the reverse, as well as a shot of the vehicle from some more angles.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9339147840/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2830/9339147840_c647e25683_n.jpg"" style=""height:165px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>Inside are five numbered bags and the instructions nicely packaged with cardboard backing to keep them flat and in pristine condition. The sticker sheet is fairly small, and they are easy enough to apply so there need be no concerns on that front.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Five superb Minifigures are included in this set, all but one of which are exclusive to this model. The first of these is <strong>Mace Windu</strong> in his Episode II attire. This is a lovely figure and is highly desirable as one of the most popular of all the Jedi with fans. His head is the same as the one which appeared last year in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9526-1"">9526</a> Palpatine&#39;s Arrest and before that on Seso from the Prince of Persia theme. The face is a nice representation of the character and being bald, he has no hairpiece.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9336352491/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3734/9336352491_a69cb7a24f_n.jpg"" style=""height:269px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso is also the same as we saw in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9526-1"">9526</a> Palpatine&#39;s Arrest with a white undershirt peeking out from behind his dark tan Jedi robes. Unfortunately, there is still no back printing which I miss as it has become the standard inclusion on licensed Minifigures. His legs are printed however with a rather nice design, showing his robe reaching to his knees. The white below this represents his boots and I quite like this inclusion, although I am certain it will not be too everybody&#39;s taste. Of course, he also comes with his famous purple lightsaber which is perfect as always.</p>

<p>Next we have a character in his first outing as a LEGO Minifigure, the Vurk Jedi <strong>Coleman Trebor</strong>. This is a very interesting Minifigure, featuring one of the oddest head moulds&nbsp;ever created by LEGO, which is a fantastic interpretation of the character from the film. The piece is cast in a slightly rubbery plastic and is dark bluish grey, with printing for his eyes and lots of detail moulded into the component. His torso is much like many other Jedi torsos, with tan robes, although this figure has some dark grey skin visible and a nice belt printed on the front and back. His legs are printed with a continuation of these flowing robes and he carries a green lightsaber.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9336349437/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3711/9336349437_289199cb22_n.jpg"" style=""height:319px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>Before I move on to the next Minifigure, just in case anybody reading is not aware of this character, he can be seen at various points during the Battle in the Petranaki&nbsp;Arena, most notably when he is able to jump onto Count Dooku&#39;s viewing balcony. Just as he prepares to strike at the nefarious Sith Lord with his lightsaber, Jango Fett steps in and blasts Trebor multiple times, leaving him to fall to his death. Therefore, the character never actually made it to the huge battle outside the arena which this set is a part of. I am not going to hold this slight inaccuracy&nbsp;against LEGO though of course as I am delighted to get the character regardless of what set he is included in.</p>

<p>The next Minifigure, and one which I am very pleased with&nbsp;is the <strong>Clone Trooper Commander</strong>. I was not sure about this figure looking at images before I actually obtained the set as I felt the yellow and white armour would be quite an eyesore. However, I am happy to admit I was wrong and now that I have the Minifigure, he looks great. His helmet is printed with an impressive level of detail, including a sliver visor, tiny grilles and of course the yellow highlights which denote him as a commander. His head piece beneath the helmet is printed with a determined face and bushy black eyebrows, the same as any other Episode II Clone Trooper Minifigure.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9339136256/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3800/9339136256_7944dd833b_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:294px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso is printed on the front and back with the white plastoid armour seen in the film, and it is highly detailed with a belt and four yellow spots on the left of his breastplate. His arms are yellow and his legs are plain white. Some leg printing would have been welcome as it is becoming more commonplace, although I am satisfied that this figure looks perfectly fine without it. A large DC-15A rifle is included with him, or at least the LEGO interpretation of one, created using a Technic pin and the standard long blaster.</p>

<p>Now onto the two <strong>Battle Droids</strong> included in this set, one of whom is a Commander. The only variation between the two is the addition of a yellow area on the head and a yellow spot on the chest of the commander. Each one is an ideal colour for Geonosis, dark orange. Unlike the Battle Droid included in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?ID=6751"">75015</a> Corporate Alliance Tank Droid, neither of these two include a 1 x 2 plate to act as a backpack, although there is no shortage of these on the market or in other sets so one could easily add a backpack to these Minifigures. Each of them is armed with a standard blaster.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9339133006/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3714/9339133006_3c48260fd6_n.jpg"" style=""height:311px; width:380px"" /></a></p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>The build is certainly not the highlight of this set. As a symmetrical vehicle there is an awful lot of repetition and mirroring. However there is a nice mix of Technic and System construction and the SNOT used for creating the panelling&nbsp;on the vehicle is satisfying. I also came across a new part while building this set, that being a 1 x 2 plate with one clip which can be seen <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=6028812"">here on Brickset</a>. Put in the simplest of terms, if you have built a Minifigure scale AT-TE before, there is not much new in this model.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>The finished AT-TE is much smaller than previous editions. However while I was initially concerned about this development, the model looks excellent in person&nbsp;and is far more accurate to the vehicle in the film than either of the previous versions. While the 2008 AT-TE is 48 studs in length (not including the additional length of the guns), this new model is a dramatically smaller 38 studs in length. However, it is a couple of studs broader, and far more densely built that the earlier edition. I am afraid I am not in possession of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=4482-1"">4482</a> AT-TE and so cannot accurately compare the two models. However by all accounts, the 2003 model was quite similar in size to the 2008 AT-TE and thus similar differences in length and breadth apply.</p>

<p>The cockpit front window slides out with a seat inside where the driver of the vehicle can sit comfortably with two levers to control the vehicle. If one wanted the set to be entirely accurate to the Battle of Geonosis, the windows should be trans-neon green rather than&nbsp;trans-clear, however, they look great as they are, in my opinion. There are four anti-personal turrets fitted on ball joints surrounding the cockpit which have a wide range of motion and are fairly accurate to the film. The large turret atop the vehicle looks absolutely brilliant in my opinion. The gun barrel can be raised and lowered independently of the seat, which has a flick-fire missile fitted on either side of it. The entire turret can of course be turned 360-degrees and can be pointed in just about any direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9339129582/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5508/9339129582_ce388a1f30_n.jpg"" style=""height:300px; width:220px"" /></a></p>

<p>Beneath the turret is a storage rack for an additional four flick fire missiles which can slide out and behind it is a useful carrying handle, which is not compatible with the Republic Dropship from set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10195-1"">10195</a>&nbsp;Republic Dropship with AT-OT Walker, although some minor adjustments&nbsp;of the handle can adapt the vehicle to fit with the Republic Dropship. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9336333989/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3819/9336333989_b6dab3a822_n.jpg"" style=""height:236px; opacity:0.9; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The rear compartment can also be opened, in which one finds a small area for placing up to three Clone Troopers. There is a rack for holding two guns and a storage container, in which there are three thermal detonators like those included in set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9516-1"">9516</a> Jabba&#39;s Palace last Summer. Two stickers form computer panels on the wall, one of which shows a Homing Spider Droid targeted. A boarding ladder can be lowered at the rear of the vehicle which is stowed away underneath. On the back of the AT-TE are two more ball joint mounted cannons.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9339116314/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3826/9339116314_37ab6b51d8_n.jpg"" style=""height:239px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The legs are quite poseable, and no rubber bands are used to hold them in place unlike on previous models. The use of printed dishes on the central pair of legs is very welcome and they look fantastic, far better than the dishes used on <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7675-1"">7675</a> AT-TE Walker.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>While I would not pick out this set as the best of the Summer releases this year, I am nevertheless very impressed by the model as a whole. In my opinion the numerous improvements make this vehicle more than worthy of being remade only five years after a Minifigure scale AT-TE was last released. Not only is the model itself excellent, but the Minifigures too are very desirable, particularly the two Jedi and Clone Trooper Commander.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9339110142/"" title=""75019 AT-TE by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75019 AT-TE"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3686/9339110142_ae2bdc9293_n.jpg"" style=""height:262px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>If you are looking to recreate the Battle of Geonosis, I hardly need mention that this set is a must. However I would recommend <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75021-1"">75021</a> Republic Gunship over this set overall, as despite commanding a slightly higher price, that set contains Minifigures which are perhaps even better than the ones included here, and the Republic Gunship is a more interesting vehicle if you ask me.</p>

<p>The cost of this set (&pound;79.99 or $89.99) is a little on the high side in my opinion, but I think it is slightly better value than some of the other sets released this Summer and I would recommend that anyone pick up this set when they can. Perhaps for those of you who are only interested in the Original Trilogy this is one you can skip in favour of others.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Parts: <strong>4</strong> - Plenty of light and dark bluish grey pieces, as well as some dark red is great, but few brand new pieces are included which limits the appeal for me a little.</li>
	<li>Playability: <strong>4.5</strong> - The missiles and moveable legs are bound to make this set a lot of fun to play with, and the Minifigures are a lot of fun.</li>
	<li>Building Experience: <strong>3.5</strong> - A lot of mirrored building is repetitive, although some nice techniques are used at times.</li>
	<li>Value for Money: <strong>4</strong> - Not an ideal price, perhaps an extra couple of Clone Troopers might have softened the blow.</li>
	<li>Overall: <strong>4</strong> - An enjoyable set as a whole, although probably not the best when compared with other sets available at a similar price point.</li>

Despite being the same build as yellow battle droids, the new colour makes the figure more interesting.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The second is a standard battle droid is very much the same as the commander except without the extra printing, but coming in the new tan colour.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The third is a clone trooper commander, who comes with new yellow printing on the arms and helmet. There's back printing of gear within white and black colours, but no leg printings. The character features an anxious facial expression and is unique to this set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Coleman Trebor, a Jedi is the fourth in this set and also another unique figure. He features a new head which is slightly rubbery and wears a Jedi robe with a belt and slight exposure if chest at the front of the torso and creases and the other side of the belt at the back. He has leg printings too and carries a green lightsaber.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The final figure is mace Windu, who is slightly different from the one in Palpatines arrest with extra leg printing , however still no printing on the back of the figure, but still a very good figure with his iconic purple lightsaber.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The model</b></div><div>The overall model whilst perhaps slightly smaller than the 2008 one is fairly large in scale and actually slightly larger than Jabba's Sail Barge, which is actually £20 more.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The front of the At-Te features four laser cannons, all of which can be rotated to different angles, but can be a bit flimsy as they can fall off if you try and move it quickly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There's also the control room, featuring a nice clear windscreen icy can be taken out of the model directly to insert or remove a figure from the driving seat.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The roofs of the At-Te can be lifted open to reveal the insides of the model, where the back releases to show a weapon storage area and enough room to fit a couple of figures too,whilst at the front exterior, there's nothing really to see except for the space missiles included for role play.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Other interesting features include, turret cannon on the top which can fit a Minifigure, but still look impressive and not empty without one, a flaw on the 2008 set, plus also easily moveable legs which can be moved around quite easily with few limitations. There's also a handle in the centre for easier swoosh ability and handling, two extra cannons on the back plus a ladder at the back, which is quite a good use considering its good for role &nbsp;play but can be hidden for display/battle situations too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion</b></div><div>Whilst not actually owning the 2008 version, this updated At-Te seems to be a general improvement on the last.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The improved swoosh ability, more compact and cleverly designed cockpit, more flexible legs, sleeker looking cannon and also access through the back.</div><div><br></div><div>There's still some drawbacks on the model, which include the cannons can be quite flimsy and fall off when rotating them, presumably a flaw with the old one too, the front section seems a bit redundant and could've had more put in plus another clone wouldn't have hurt.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>At £80, the sets price is ok, and perhaps marginally better value than previous £80 sets, but considering its £10 more than the old one, it's had a fair bit of a rise, which would've received full marks if still £70.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However overall a very good set and one that goes very well with the gunship, which I recommend buying both if possible because they go very well together and feel slightly incomplete with just one.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However if you can only get on them, I'd say save up the £30 for the gunship.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"wii1232","2014-04-22T01:49:00.81Z","Bad Turrets but a Great Edition","<p>The title of my review is deceiving. &nbsp;This is a GREAT set! &nbsp;But there are a few minor issues that don&#39;t make it excellent.</p>

<p>The box is good for its size, &amp; there are two instruction booklets.</p>

<p>The parts are good, with the nice bluish-gray &amp; dark gray bricks.</p>

<p>Now the&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;I have concerns/misunderstandings about. &nbsp;I would TOTALLY have replaced Coleman&nbsp;Trebor&nbsp;with a Clone Trooper to man the primary laser cannon, because&nbsp;Trebor&nbsp;died in the arena when he was shot by&nbsp;Jango&nbsp;Fett&nbsp;and fell to the ground. &nbsp;He was never in the battle. &nbsp;Mace wasn&#39;t on the ground in the battle, but he was in a&nbsp;gunship, so that counts. &nbsp;Otherwise the Clone/Battle Droid Commanders &amp; Battle Droid are good.</p>

<p>The build took about 1-2 hours, but paid off in the end.</p>

<p>The completed model was shorter in length than I thought it would be. &nbsp;But there are more important issues. &nbsp;No matter which&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;I put in the cockpit, they always knock off the control levers, because there&#39;s absolutely NO room for their arms, unless I put them at the tippy tops of the control levers. &nbsp;Otherwise the only other MAJOR issue is that if the turret arms bump into a wall or something, they pop off easily! &nbsp;Also the legs are too loose &amp;&nbsp;unposeable. &nbsp;But the retractable ladder, rotating primary cannon on top, handle, room in the back, and detailing give this set a 5 rating.</p>

<p>My overall opinion is that it will make a great edition to your Republic Army/Battle of&nbsp;Geonosis&nbsp;collection. &nbsp;I do recommend this set to any LEGO Star Wars fan/geek.</p>

"PooPotato","2014-03-23T03:33:18.68Z","Attack of the AT-TE","<p>Watching Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones is one of my fondest memories of my childhood. &nbsp;After a couple of re-watches, I still get a good chuckle from the awkward acting and scene changes, but The Battle of Geonosis still remains as an absolute favorite scene for me. This scene, paired with Star Wars Battlefront, helped solidify my adoration for this vehicle, so when I missed purchasing 4482, I was truly devastated. &nbsp;Due to a curious distaste for the Clone Wars line, i skipped 7675 (my brother ended up purchasing this one, and I&#39;m glad I bought 7676 instead!) as well and waited for another five years for a decent film replication. Let&#39;s just say I&#39;m glad I waited another five years!</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box was a lot thinner than other large scale sets I have bought, and personally I like that they aren&#39;t packaging as much air with them anymore! &nbsp;Due to the last $80+ set I purchased being 10188, I was happily surprised to receive a cardboard slab in-between&nbsp;the 2 instruction booklets, along with an orange brick separator. &nbsp;I do plan on purchasing 75021 Republic Gunship in May, so we&#39;ll see if this packaging pattern continues!&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Due to this being a Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) vehicle, a large majority of the pieces are light grey, with dark grey highlights and a dark red cockpit. &nbsp;One thing I am very happy about is that the cockpit has a completely clear windscreen, and not a dimmed one. &nbsp;One of the main pet-peeves I had with 7675 was the blurry windscreen that disallowed you from seeing who was actually piloting the walker...</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigures are definitely a highlight of this set. &nbsp;All of them are new to this kit, so that added to the overall pleasure of purchasing it. &nbsp;This set marks my first Mace Windu, and he is included here with his battle clothing and a purple lightsaber. &nbsp;I always wished that they had expanded on his character in the prequels, instead of giving him a minor role as an annoyance to Vader in Episode III. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This set also includes a Geonosian&nbsp;Battle Droid Commander, and a regular&nbsp;Geonosian&nbsp;Battle Droid. &nbsp;I thought that it was a shame that 75000 Clone Troopers vs. Droidekas didn&#39;t come with Geonosian Battle Droids instead of Droidekas, so they are both a nice addition. &nbsp;It is rather odd that they don&#39;t come with back plates like the one included with 75015 though. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Another welcome inclusion is the Jedi Master Coleman Trebor. &nbsp;A lot of fans probably don&#39;t remember this guy from the films, but after watching Episode II a couple thousand times as a kid, I clearly remember him almost killing Dooku, who smugly watched him get gunned down by Jango Fett&nbsp;in the Geonosian Arena. &nbsp;It isn&#39;t entirely accurate that he be included with this set, but as I don&#39;t see an Arena set coming any time soon it was probably the right decision to put him in this one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Last but not least is the Clone Trooper Commander, who is denoted by the yellow highlights on his helmet, arms, and torso. &nbsp;He looks absolutely stunning next to the Clone Trooper Sergeant and Lieutenant, and looks wonderful piloting this walker. &nbsp;The helmet printing on mine was slightly off, but you have to look REALLY close to notice it, so it doesn&#39;t bug me too much. &nbsp;It was a bit disappointing that the set didn&#39;t come with one more trooper to have a complete crew.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>As with any other starship/vehicle, the build was very symmetrical and repetitive. &nbsp;It was definitely not difficult in any way, and if I recall correctly it only took me about an hour and fifteen minutes of work to put it together. &nbsp;The stickers weren&#39;t too large, and definitely accent the model in a positive way.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>Compared to 7675, this model wins in every way. &nbsp;Although 7675 is certainly longer and appears larger, it only comes with a mere four pieces more than this set, and 7675 came with a STAP so in my eyes this walker contains more pieces than its predecessor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When compared physically to 7675, this model is wider, bulkier, and much more stable. &nbsp;Nothing wobbles and falls off easily, and the main turret on this one is 10x better than the one in 7675, which had very poor elevation and balance. &nbsp;The lack of rubber bands is also welcome, although this would definitely hamper play on a carpeted floor, as the back and front legs don&#39;t like to slide out. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Turning the front compartment into an ammo cache was a wonderful inclusion, and adds that touch of diversity that was missing from previous versions. &nbsp;The back compartment comes with an ammo crate full of thermal detonators, and includes 2 clips to hold rifles. &nbsp;If you remove this crate, you can fit up to 5 Clone Troopers comfortably and still close the hatch, which is rather nice. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>At first i was a bit nervous about buying this set, but after building it and seeing it compared to 7675, I am completely satisfied with my purchase. &nbsp;It was most certainly the highlight of my 2013 summer line buying frenzy, and hopefully 75021 will blow this one out of the water! &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Awesome minifigs</p>

<p>Fun build</p>

<p>Looks great next to the other 2013 Summer sets</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Printing was a bit off on my Clone Trooper Commander&#39;s helmet</p>

<p>Lack of one extra Clone for a crew</p>

"Tar_Domo","2014-10-07T14:20:37.733Z","Good for the figures - My full analysis of the AT-TE","<p>As the title says the highlight of the set are the minifigures but of course the walker is also cool specially if you&acute;ve missed the earlier Clone Wars movie version.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This came in a quite big box but it&acute;s smaller than Republic Gunship&acute;s and about the same size with Palpatines Arrest. The instructions were in two booklets and they were easy to follow. You could even do some parts of building out of order: I made some mistake with the hull and skipped to the legs and then came back to the hull when I could concentrate on that problem better.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This has 794 parts and that&acute;s not a lot when compared to sets like Jedi Defender-class&nbsp; Cruiser and many others. It&acute;s about the same piece count as in the Fury-class Sith Interceptor that I thought was pricey and wasn&acute;t getting it before I found it in 50% sale. But this set has of course more minifigures than Fury and the figures are great. Still, wouldn&acute;t pay just for the minifigs.</p>

<p>This set isn&acute;t a Must-have-because-of-the-parts. It has nice parts like those round gray parts that you need 2 to create a ball. Also the light-grey parts used in the bottom of it&acute;s foots are cool.</p>

<p>The set contains mostly grey parts and also some red parts.</p>

<p>I wouldn&acute;t describe this as a MOC builders dream unless you&acute;re gonna build your own walker.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><em>Coleman Trebor</em> - He&acute;s the main exclusive minifig in this set and an Episode 2 collectors must-have. He has excusive headpiece and green lightsaber. He plays quite a small role in Episode 2 so it&acute;s not a must-have if you just&nbsp;want to make a Episode 2 lego video.</p>

<p><em>Mace Windu </em>- He has white leg printings but otherwise is not too interesting one. Nice to have, but for me as the owner of a army containing at least three Mace Windus he wans&acute;t something I really needed.</p>

<p><em>Battle droid Geonosian </em>- In the set they say just it&acute;s a battle droid, but it is the Geonosian variation. I have the earlier Geonosian version and it looks a bit silly while the other three Geonosians are these new versions so it kinda annoys me that they changed the look. It is cool, though.</p>

<p><em>Battle droid Geonosian commander</em> - Same as with the BDG in the set they tell us it&acute;s called just battle droid commander. It has yellow on it&acute;s face and body as also some other BD commanders. Cool, exclusive minifig overall.</p>

<p><em>Clone trooper commander </em>- Cool minifig and a good add to any phase 1 clone army. He has yellow printings in arms and helmet and comes with a bigger blaster built from a tecnic part and basic bigger blaster.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about 2 hours, I think. It was quite easy but the legs were of course a bit repetitive. It wasn&acute;t still a big part of the job so that wasn&acute;t such a bad thing. It came with some stickers but I hadn&acute;t any bigger problems with them. The parts were in seven bags and figures in many different bags. I don&acute;t know the reason putting the figures that way but my guess is that it&acute;s for the kids for motivation: If you build this part, then you&acute;ll get that minifig.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is quite big and has no bigger balance problems. I had to put some 4x1 parts from a random set to make the two roof parts not to separate all the time from the walker. Also the missile thing inside the walker is dropping easily. Otherwise this is a good set for both, play and display.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I recommend this set for the minifigures and cool walker. It&acute;s mostly for the prequel fans.</p>

It&#39;s Gabriel here, or, as my username suggests, grsotnas. This is my second&nbsp;review in Brickset. I always appreciate critics and suggestions, to improve them even more! As I&#39;m from Brazil, my English may not be perfect, but I&#39;ll do my best! I look forward to add pictures to this review, so check back in a few days, if you want!</em></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very big, and, most interestingly, very wide. It measures 54x28cm or 21x11 inches. It may not be the biggest box of the Star Wars sets from that wave (Summer 2013; the biggest box is the 75021-Gunship). The box shows the AT-TE&nbsp;in a battle scene, and 5 minifigures included in this set, all of them are new.</p>

<p>This set includes some stickers and features a brick separator - always handy and useful.</p>

<p>The instructions come in 2 booklets, A4 sized. In the 1st booklet, you build the structure, the cockpit and 4 legs, in 65 pages. And in the 2nd booklet, you add 2 more legs, the&nbsp;&nbsp;panels, the main turret and the rear panels, in 48 pages. You have 51 steps in this particular set.</p>

<p>There are 5 numbered bags:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1 - Main structure and 3 figures</p>

<p>2 - Cockpit and front weapons</p>

<p>3 - 4 legs: the front and rear legs.</p>

<p>4 - 2 &quot;middle&quot; legs and the handle</p>

<p>5 - Panels, Main turret and Rear panels.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 794 pieces in this set, most of them being light bluish gray, or dark bluish gray. There are a few black and dark red pieces as well. I&#39;m not a specialist in pieces, know which one are exclusive/rare. But you do get some interesting pieces, in my opinion. There are both system and technic pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get 5 minifigures in this set, and, according to the box, all of them are new/redesigned. So, let&#39;s look at them individually:</p>

<p>Mace Windu: This minifigure looks fantastic! IMO this is the best version of Windu ever, and the only one I own (I compared them trough pictures on the internet). His face looks clean and accurate, much better than the Clone Wars version.&nbsp;He has leg printing, always good to get. His iconic purple lightsaber is also present.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Colemann Trebor: He is a different Jedi, and was only seen on the Attack of the Clones, Geonosis Arena scene. However, he died really early and didn&#39;t actually participate with the Clones. But, looking at him as a minifig: he has similar printing on his torso and legs in comparison with Mace&#39;s, but on different colours. His hed is different, and resembles a dinosaur (<em>Parasaurolophus</em>), and is very unique. I like it.&nbsp;He has a green lightsaber.</p>

<p>Battle droids: You get a regular and a commander. It has nothing to do with this set, and looks like &quot;the enemy&quot; you should destroy with the AT-TE. I would prefer 2 Clone Troopers instead, but, for a kid that will only get this set, you get two of the bad guys...</p>

<p>Clone Trooper Commander: this minifig looks fantastic in my opinion. A clone trooper with yellow markings, with a nice, large blaster.</p>

<p>Overall the minifig selection is very good, but I would prefer to have 1-2 more ordinary Clone Troopers, and wouldn&#39;t mind losing those 2 droids. But it is still pretty good. If you could add some more troopers from other set/battle back (eg. #75000) this set will look even better.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build offers a pleasant mix of Technic and system pieces. The structure is basically all technic, in order to make it sturdier. The build is most enjoyable and, as a simmetrical model you will do a lot of mirror building, but I don&#39;t find it so bad.&nbsp;It took me about 2-3 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a beautiful and accurate AT-TE, at least in my opinion. The model is really sturdy and won&#39;t brake on you, as some of the previous versions did. The cockpit can be desingaged, and you can sit a minifig there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The turret, on top of the AT-TE looks very good, offers a full 360&ordm; rotation and 0-45&ordm; inclination. It is also very big, and you can sit a minifig to operate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Below the turret, you can open a hatch, revealing 4 flick fire missles, that look OK, but as the AT-TE is a troop transportation, I would have preferred extra room for even more troopers. Younger kids will probably like it, though.</p>

<p>All the weight of the model is supported on 4 legs, 2 on the front and 2 on the back. These legs offers a small angle of movement, and it is difficult to replicate a convincing walking action, but it is kind of possible. The 2 legs on the middle are there just for the looks, and they do their function briliantly. They have some range of motion, perhaps 30&ordm;.</p>

<p>The rear section can be opened up, and you can see a small room. It is meant to carry troops. However, you can&#39;t fit Colemann Trebor in some positions because he&#39;s so tall with that head! I personally would&#39;ve preferred if that space was bigger, and could fit more minifigures. A few sits, such as AT-OT would be a welcome too, but, I&#39;m not complaining, don&#39;t get me wrong. It is just my opinion.</p>

<p>Compared to the previous versions, this one is smaller (in lenght), but is a little wider (I do not own 7675, I just saw on the net!). But I think that the choice of colours, in light and dark gray, and the dark red is more accurate and looks better! This is a Republic War Tank/Transport, so it&#39;s not intended to be colorful!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is almost perfect! It is amazing, definitely has the looks, and you also get some nice minifigs. The turret is very good, the cockpit can be taken off, and the legs are also very nice! It is extremely sturdy, and younger kids will be able to play with this set easily.</p>

<p>Although in the box it&#39;s ratedd for ages 9-14, I&#39;m 15 and love this set.</p>

<p>If you are a Star Wars fan, particularly if you are a Prequels and Clone Wars fan (such as I&#39;m) this is a must have set for you. If possible, I&#39;d get 2 of those, and 1-2 Gunships as well. I own 7676 - 2008 Gunship, and it looks very good with this set. If you wasn&#39;t fortunate to get the 7675 (2008 AT-TE), and want a nice set, this is the set for you. If you want a better model, or build an army, this is the set for you.</p>

<p>I would appreciate 1-2 more CT on this set, and a little extra space for transporting troops, but you can do some mods, but it surely looks great if built according to the instructions.</p>

<p>In the US this set costs $90, and I think that it is just worth it. You won&#39;t regret it. If you get this set for a lower price, say $80, it is a fantastic deal, and I recommend buying one of those. In Brazil, LEGO sets are way overpriced, so I paid R$ 560 (reais) for it, or, with todays currency (1USD = 2,7 R$) it cost about 200 US dollars, but I don&#39;t regret it.</p>

<p>Overall, if you want a large set, withanice figures,and that looks great, this is the set for you. Strongly recommended.</p>

"MOCmaker38","2018-03-16T09:26:04.623Z","A nice set for a MOC, display or play","<p>When I first picked up this set back in 2013 at my local target, I was really excited to get it because I missed out on getting the 2008 AT-TE and had been wanting one. I got exactly what I wanted, plus a little extra. Being 17 at the time, most people in my family thought I was &quot;out-growing LEGO&quot; and &quot;needed a real hobby&quot;. Well, this set and the 75021 Republic Gunship were what brought me out of the dark ages. After picking up 2 gunships and 2 of these walkers, I started working on an awesome MOC. The interior of the walker is quite spacious. You can fit multiple lightsabers, a box of grenades, multiple blasters an (I was able to fit) 8 minifigures. Underneath the main cannon on top, you can fit a rack of missiles, but my younger brother really liked taking the missiles out and using it as a &quot;bad guy&nbsp;prison&quot; for a captive TX-20 Tactical droid or Nute Gunray or any important Separatist&nbsp;leader. The driver&#39;s seat is easy to pull out and fits a clone pilot. The included minifigs in the set were mediocre. I especially&nbsp;liked Mace Windu and the clone commander. Coleman Trebor was OK to put in the set, but he has mere seconds of screen time, and maybe a pilot or a couple of clone troopers would have been just as awesome as getting Master Trebor. The battle droids are alright, but there is no way to get lots of those battle droids, as I believe they are only included in 2 or 3 sets, so army building is improbable. The inclusion of a commander is nice, I will admit. After taking it over to a friend&#39;s house around Christmas time 2013, I noticed that the 2008 AT-TE was quite larger than this one. I am actually satisfied with that, as the smaller size makes it more suitable for display shelves, and MOCs. Overall, I was very satisfied with the build, and I am glad to now have a grand total of 3 in my collection.</p>

"JarJarBricks","2021-02-05T14:23:20.277Z","One of my favorite sets","<p>This is a good set for playing with or displaying on your shelf. It has a handle to walk it along the floor or the table, and has a firing missile. It comes with two jedi and one clone, along with&nbsp;battle droids, one a commander.</p>

<p>If you want this set for display, then you are in luck. This can go on a plain shelf or on your Battle display. This atte can go in pretty much any ground battle (besides kashyyyk.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has some pretty desired minifigures, too. It has a Coleman Trebor minifigure, and a Mace Windu minifigure, along with&nbsp;clone trooper Commander Ponds, to Fight the battle droids. The downside to the minifigure selection is that it only has one clone trooper, but you can pick up more of those for relatively cheap.</p>

<p>The play features in this set are the handle (mentioned earlier), a missile canon with interchangeable missile colors, a back spot for minifigures and a crate with thermal detonators. This set also features an opening cabin and rotating cannon on top, as well as six ball joint cannons on the front and back.</p>

<p>Build experience is fun, because its fun to see the iconic vehicle come along as you build it.</p>

<p>Parts include some stickered panels, and two printed dishes on each middle leg. Most of the pieces are light bluish or dark bluish grey, and some black and new dark red pieces.&nbsp;The price per piece is not very great, but average for a star wars set, but the minifigures and magnificent build definitely make up for that.</p>

<p>Overall probably one of my favorite vehicles in the republic army, and LEGO captures it very well especially for the time in 2013. It&#39;s the best atte LEGO has made yet, even better than the newest one, from rebels (don&#39;t buy the rebels atte.) You can recreate iconic battle scenes like either battle of geonosis, christophsis, felucia or utapau.</p>

<p>If you want to get this set nowadays in 2021, I recommend getting it used, as you can&#39;t get it for very cheap new these days.&nbsp;</p>
