"zipsforbananas","2013-06-17T10:16:09.09Z","Typical 2012-13 Jabba set - flawed, but you get Max Rebo!","<p>There's a running theme in the 2012-13 Jabba the Hutt sets.<br>The palace was absolutely shockingly priced, but was a nice enough model with bags of playability and sensational figures.<br>The Skiff was not such bad value, a very nice model, and had superb figures.<br>And the Rancor Pit was abysmally priced again, a decent enough model, and had a 'figure' you just have to have.<br>So, what about the Sail Barge? Yep, poor price (though not as dreadful as the buildings), nice enough model, and figures you just have to own! A perfect fit into the sub-theme!</p><p>The <b>build</b> is a bit of a mixed bag. Given the size of the ship and its hollow nature it needs a strong Technic chassis, but the build seems a little cumbersome. There's a great variety as you move between the sections and bags, making the inner shell, the nose, the side panels and then the deck, but within each section things do become quite repetitive, which I imagine would bore younger children a little. The stickers are pretty good. I assume printing onto the plates with clips would be difficult, and square and rectangular stickers (2x2 , 3x2 and 4x2) are easy enough to apply well.</p><p>There are some nice techniques in places though that add a some interest. The way the side engines hold in a wheel each is nice. The shutters are integrated into the side panels very nicely. A number of the smaller parts are good too - both the guns on the deck are nice to assemble, and Max Rebo's keyboardy thing is brilliant! The back section of the ship that houses the keyboard begins very well too: the 45 degree angle for the curve is created excellently, and the rotating keyboard is delightful and easy too show off.<br>But the side panels ruin things somewhat for me. They are a long way off meeting up with the long sides, and the back panel starts too far back compared to the angled panels, and it rests at a sharper angle so it ends up being too short. I'd built it in LDD before I bought the set, so I knew it was coming, but I hoped the real thing would have a little more play and not look so obvious. Unfortunately it's just as glaring in reality and tarnishes the whole set for me.</p><p>The nose is the other striking part of the set, particularly because the previous version cleverly/lazily (you decide!) put boat hull pieces upside-down to make the whole thing with very little building. This version is properly brick-built, and has a cannon hidden inside that slides forward as you open the hatch. It's a great touch, and with the whole section detaching so that you can get to the cannon and fire it it adds some great playability. (For nostalgia's sake I love having the cannon in there, it's great to own one again after all the ones I used to have in pirate sets, and it's a great gun-metal colour!)<br>But at the same time I feel dubious about the nose. The identical slopes that are just set back from each other seem like half a job. And the slopes attached to the side don't quite cover all of the pieces that hold them on, which just seems shoddy. But they do match up with the side panels well, and I can't think quite how else the curved slope could be achieved, so all I've got is a nagging dissatisfaction, but no idea what could have been done about it!</p><p>Despite these quite large gripes I do rather like the <b>finished model</b>. I don't have the previous version so I can't compare them size-wise, but I've mentioned the 2009 shift in aesthetics a number of times in my reviews, and this set fits with them well. It feels compact and all very well integrated (except for the gaps at the back), looks really good, and is quite a lot larger than I would have expected despite that good compact feel.</p><p>And the set's real stand-out features are its playability and its figures.<br>The <b>playability</b> is really excellent, with the whole set opening out well. There's not a great deal of room downstairs, but the brig is solid, the kitchen area is charming, and as I've already mentioned Max Rebo's keyboard is superb. The opening shutters are nice, although they're a bit high up for minifigures to see out of without a significant boost. And with the detachable nose, and the stepped deck with the great looking main gun there's tonnes of battle potential. The fully movable sails make access to the deck easier too, though I'm not sure about them being plastic rather than cloth, it seems a bit of a pity. And the wheels on the bottom mean with a good shove the whole thing moves at quite a speed, though given its weight it does stop quite abruptly.</p><p>And of course the <b>figures</b>&nbsp;are a real treat. Jabba's Palace set a new benchmark, so another set with Jabba in just had to carry that on!<br><b>Jabba</b>&nbsp;himself is identical to the Palace version, but you do need him here, and with Leia on a chain he's different enough when posed. The green shade and printing is superb, with his rolls of fat represented beautifully! And the printing on his face is great, with really detailed eyes, and the tattoo on his arm is a nice touch.<br><b>Leia</b> is well done, very nicely printed and has a new rubbery hairpiece to allow for the long braid at the back. Her happy face seems a bit inappropriate, more sweet than anything, but her scowl is perfect, showing all the resentment she'd be feeling for the indignity!<br><b>R2-D2</b>&nbsp;is the usual good print, and his drinks tray is well stocked. Simples!<br><b>Weequay</b>&nbsp;is lovely, with good printing and colours in his torso, and an excellent leathery face, with a printed ponytail that runs down onto his back.<br><b>Ree-Yees</b>&nbsp;is really great with a superb new head piece giving his his goat-like mouth and distinctive three eyes.<br>And the highlight of the set is <b>Max Rebo</b>. The only printing anywhere on him is his eyes, but the electric blue colour is great, and the headpiece looks amazing! (But he's not an elephant... and neither is N-Sync's Joey Fatone...)</p><p>My only gripes with the figures are the somewhat plain printing on Ree-Yees, with none on Weequay's legs and none on Max Rebo. And most of the figures from the palace set can be moved across, and these moved there for even more playability all together, but is it just me, or is C-3P0 glaringly absent? It's a real shame, particularly as his new version is only in the one set (so far), and he plays such a major role in all of the scenes in the film he just had to be in one of the Palace, the Skiff or here didn't he? I think Lego really dropped the ball on that one.</p><p>There's one more little bonus with the poster that shows a great film recreation with this and the Skiff set. It's been given an oil painting effect which isn't at all believable but softens it up and makes it look much nicer than a photo or straight CGI scene would have. I'm not that fussed as an AFOL, but younger fans will love it I'm sure! And the reverse has the 2013 minifigure gallery, though it doesn't have any of the planet figures or the September sets (obviously, as they hadn't been revealed when this set was released), and it splits them into good guys/bad guys. As an OT purist I'm not all that interested in that side either, but again, younger fans or whole saga fans might well love it.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Bags and bags of playability, particularly if you combine it with the Skiff and the Palace figures</li><li>A superb selection if well done figures, with the stand-out Ree-Yees and Rebo</li><li>Looks great overall, compact and all together</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Some quality issues with the side panels not fitting together well</li><li>Where's Threepio? My R2 to 3P0 ratio is just getting silly!</li><li>Just a few niggles - the brick built nose seems not quite right, the sails are all plastic and shiny, and there's a huge gap all the way round between the lower deck floor and the sides.</li></ul>
<p>As the only Old Trilogy set released this summer this was an obvious target, and to finish the set of Jabba related scenes it's a must. It's a very nice model in its own right and I've pointed out quite a few niggles, but overall you can forgive them because all together the model is good.&nbsp;It looks great posed on my Tatooine shelf, and it would be equally excellent in any kid's play scene.&nbsp;The value is actually okay (well, actually very poor, but compared to the other Jabba sets good, and compared to standard Star Wars prices only a little pricey). And the figures you get are superb, and only sadly lacking a C-3P0. It'll be a must-have for most Star Wars Lego collectors, and happily I think most will be glad they bought it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3

<p>In recent years, LEGO seems to have produced far more Prequel Trilogy sets than Original Trilogy models, and this wave is an excellent example of this continuing trend. <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75020-1"">75020</a> Jabba&#39;s Sail Barge is the only set from the Summer 2013 selection which is from the Original Trilogy, and I am quite pleased with it overall.</p>

<p>Initial images of the set were not at all encouraging. The nose looked awful and the Minifigure selection seemed quite small for a set which costs &pound;99.99 or $119.99 for 850-pieces. While this set is far from perfect, the Sail Barge is, in my opinion, far better in person than the artwork would suggest, much like the recent LEGO Cuusoo offering of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=21103-1"">21003</a> The Delorean Time Machine. The Minifigures are excellent, and the actual vehicle is a nice representation of the Sail Barge in the film.</p>

<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>As I have already mentioned, the box artwork does this model no favours whatsoever. The angle at which the ship has been photographed is not very complimentary at all and due to the rather dull colours of the Sail Barge and the Tatooine background, the image does not look quite as vibrant as many other boxes do, particularly in the Star Wars theme. The usual green border runs along the top of the box and at the bottom we see the Minifigure gallery and an advertisement for the poster which is included inside.&nbsp;The back of the box displays the set opened up and includes some images demonstrating the features, along with a couple of rather cinematic shots.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9548456053/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7386/9548456053_c98a9c9b33.jpg"" style=""height:232px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>There are two instruction booklets included along with the aforementioned poster, the plastic sails and a sticker sheet, all of which are packaged with a cardboard backing to prevent warping. There are six numbered bags inside, as well as a small bag containing the components used for making up Jabba the Hutt.</p>

<p>The poster is designed with a rather interesting style, which looks rather like an watercolour painting. The shot is action packed with explosions and laser bolts as the Rebels skirmish with Jabba and his entourage over the Pit of Carkoon.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Six Minifigures are included in this set, four of which are brand new. I will begin with one of the characters we have seen before, the infamous crime lord <strong>Jabba the Hutt</strong>, who is central to this set of course. An identical figure appeared in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9516-1"">9516</a> Jabba&#39;s Palace last year which is perfect as far as I am concerned. Jabba is made up of three parts, his printed head, a blue Technic pin and the body and tail section, thus allowing him to twist at this joint. His arms too are poseable, and can hold items in just the same manner as any other Minifigure would.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9551237242/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3732/9551237242_2e0f314e74.jpg"" style=""height:258px; width:400px"" /></a></p>

<p>The head is printed with some tan markings and bright&nbsp;orange eyes. On the back are some wrinkles and the same small tattoo appears on his arm as first appeared on Jabba the Hutt last year. I think this detail is a delight, as are all of the little textured touches on the whole of the figure representing his nostrils and lascivious mouth. The bottom half is printed with some simple wrinkles in dark tan and there are twenty studs underneath for Jabba to be attached to a LEGO surface. I cannot find fault with this version of Jabba the Hutt and I hope that this figure is used for some more years to come.</p>

<p>Continuing with the members of Jabba&#39;s entourage, the next Minifigure is a simple <strong>Weequay Skiff Guard</strong>. Despite this Minifigure&#39;s fairly basic nature, it should prove to be very&nbsp;useful. In any Tatooine MOC, a few unnamed pirates are a necessity and this figure fills that role perfectly. The head is printed with the leathery skin which is just about unique to the Weequay species and the detail here is quite incredible, right down to the vacant black eyes which are notable in the film. Black mesh was used&nbsp;to hide the actors&#39; eyes inside, leaving Weequay with a rather creepy appearance. The back of the head is printed with the top section of his ponytail and this is continued down onto the torso.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9551234662/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3822/9551234662_3f89efe5e8.jpg"" style=""height:294px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>The front of the torso is detailed with reddish brown padding and a simple belt. The back is mostly occupied by the ponytail which looks fairly realistic. Some may complain that this design is printed rather than having a separate mould, although I think it looks great as it is. His legs are plain tan and he carries a Vibro-axe, which consists of an axe head attached to a pearl dark grey spear piece.</p>

<p>Next we have the first ever Gran Minifigure produced by LEGO, the criminal&nbsp;<strong>Ree-Yees</strong>. This is an obscure character, notable only for having a hand deformity. Getting a head piece for the three-eyed Gran is a treat, as these&nbsp;aliens are commonly seen throughout the Star Wars galaxy, and therefore they&nbsp;will fit into just about any Star Wars MOC much like the Weequay Skiff Guard. The head mould is highly detailed and looks fantastic. It is cast in a rubbery tan plastic, with printed eyes and lots of moulded details, including ears, nostrils and even the tiny antennae which are just about visible on the top of the head.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9548444501/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7422/9548444501_6ab7659058.jpg"" style=""height:344px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso is a fairly standard design, featuring a striped brown tunic and a very simple belt, both of which are continued onto the back. His legs are plain dark brown and Ree-Yees is equipped with a standard blaster.</p>

<p><strong>Max Rebo</strong> could be considered the most memorable character from the whole of Star Wars&nbsp;Episode VI: Return of the Jedi. He is renowned as looking like a blue elephant and despite only appearing for a few seconds in the film, he has acquired quite a backstory. The LEGO Minifigure is uncomplicated but outstanding. The head mould is of course the most important component of the figure, and it it does not disappoint. It is cast in a slightly rubbery plastic just like Ree-Yees, and the only printing on the piece is for his eyes. All of the key features of this character are captured including the &#39;trunk,&#39; the large and rather flabby ears, and even the dimples which are just about visible on the character in the film.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9551230414/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3830/9551230414_81cf6b8365.jpg"" style=""height:311px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso and short legs are both plain blue with no printing, although this is perfectly reasonable as there is not much of Max Rebo visible in the films anyway beyond his head and he looks fine in plain blue. I am very impressed with this Minifigure, far more&nbsp;than I had expected, as while he retains a perfect level of simplicity, the character is still captured very nicely indeed and he looks fantastic when playing his Nalargon.</p>

<p>Now we can get on to the heroes of the set, the first of which is <strong>Princess Leia</strong> in her slave attire. This is perhaps the Minifigure which was most anticipated from this set, as without this particular character, the scenes involving Jabba the Hutt in Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi are not complete. Princess Leia has appeared twice before in this outfit, firstly in the traditional yellow in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=4480-1"">4480</a> Jabba&#39;s Palace and then later in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6210-1"">6210</a> Jabba&#39;s Sail Barge where the only major change was the colour of her skin from yellow to flesh. This is the first time therefore that this character has received a major overhaul, and this newest edition is simply outstanding.</p>

<p>Her hair is a brand new piece, which is cast in a rubbery plastic and printed with a huge amount of detail. The mould takes account of the fact that a chain is attached to her back using a bracket, and the ponytail curves as such. There are some golden details in her hair just as in the film and even a pearl gold hair clip at the bottom of her ponytail. Her head is the same as all the recent Leia Minifigures, with one smiling expression, and the other frustrated. She has some red lipstick and brown eyebrows, which match up nicely with Carrie Fisher in the film.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9548441067/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3812/9548441067_3c38371b06.jpg"" style=""height:300px; width:281px"" /></a>&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9558454692/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5470/9558454692_5c41f842ce.jpg"" style=""height:300px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>Around her neck, Leia wears a bracket to which one can attach the chain which is included, so Jabba can reel her in as&nbsp;he wishes. Her torso is printed with the famous golden bikini and the design is continued onto her back, although this is mostly obscured by the bracket around her neck. Her hips and legs are printed with the dark red and gold sash which she wears during this&nbsp;scene&nbsp;in Return of the Jedi. Overall, this is an excellent Minifigure and by far the best version of the character we have seen.</p>

<p>The final Minifigure included is <strong>R2-D2</strong>, who includes a serving tray with some glasses and bottles on it. The figure is the same as always with a light bluish grey dome piece, printed with various displays and gadgets and the same cylindrical body which is detailed with flaps and compartments in which R2-D2 stores various tools. Between the domed head and body is a dark tan 2 x 4 plate which is what forms the drinks tray, in just the same manner as the R2-D2 Minifigure in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6210-1"">6210</a> Jabba&#39;s Sail Barge from 2006. A translucent clear mug and goblet is included, as well as a translucent black bottle.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>I found construction of this set very entertaining indeed. It takes about two hours at a leisurely pace and features some interesting building techniques, including a combination of slopes and plates to form the nose as well as plenty of SNOT construction used to form the armour plating for the entire vehicle. I also noted that the flooring towards the rear of the Sail Barge is created using tessellating <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/search/?query=2419"">3 x 6&nbsp;wedge plates</a> which might be new to some people. Lastly, the use of skeleton legs to support the railing around the front of the barge is ingenious, despite not being a new technique. It will be new to some people, and it achieves a very pleasing appearance in my opinion so is a technique well worth noting.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>Perhaps the most notable factor involved in this set is the size, which is actually rather smaller than the 2006 edition of the Sail Barge. This set is a full &pound;40 more expensive than the original, and that model also came with a Desert Skiff. I fully understand that it is not entirely fair to compare sets nowadays to sets from more than three or four years ago, although there is little doubt that this set is lacking in terms of value for money. In the photos below one can see the length of the two Sail Barges&nbsp;and the noses of each compared. In both photos, the model at the bottom is <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75020-1"">75020</a>, whereas the one at the top is <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6210-1"">6210</a>.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9548435833/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2877/9548435833_40d7679425.jpg"" style=""height:200px; width:370px"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9551218682/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2852/9551218682_6b33e5d7fb.jpg"" style=""height:200px; width:230px"" /></a></p>

<p>Putting that to one side for the moment however, this is actually a great set. Starting at the front, it is the nose which has received a great deal of criticism, despite this though, I rather like this nose design as it is undoubtedly more accurate to the film than the previous edition of the Sail Barge, capturing the gradient of this area of the vehicle perfectly. Inside is perhaps the oddest feature I have encountered in a Star Wars set, a hidden cannon. This cannon can be fired by pulling back on the knob at the rear, so to launch one of the orange cylinders which are stored inside the barge, one must take the entire assembly out of the vehicle. This might be a fun feature, but I would much rather have seen a cockpit area.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9551213840/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5515/9551213840_53e3547b8e.jpg"" style=""height:225px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>Behind this, a gaol cell is included, which can be accessed via a door which leads into the kitchen. On the wall, a frying pan, a fish and a leg of chicken are hung. There is also a box with a printed lid and a saucepan in this area, which is placed on a small hob, and has some kind of blue concoction cooking inside (which is in fact a blue ice cream piece). The printed lid of the box has also appeared in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7930-1"">7930</a> Bounty Hunter Gunship and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9525-1"">9525</a> Pre Vizsla&#39;s Mandalorian Starfighter and has some Aurebesh writing printed on it, which reads &#39;LOCK.&#39; There are four shutters which open here on each side and they work much better than the shutters on the old model, which I found were quite difficult to line up properly.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9551208116/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3801/9551208116_8c83d8cfc8.jpg"" style=""height:225px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>The next area is Jabba&#39;s lounge, where one finds a dark green and red rug for Jabba the Hutt to sit on. There is just about space for Leia to stand in front of him as she does in the film, and they can peek out of the opening shutters to view the planned execution of Luke Skywalker and his friends, just as they do in the film. In the very back of the vehicle is an area for Max Rebo&#39;s nicely constructed Nalargon instrument which can swivel on its base.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9548414647/"" title=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75020 - Jabba's Sail Barge"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2815/9548414647_ea7b3a5907.jpg"" style=""height:193px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>On the top deck of the Sail Barge are two sails, which are made from a soft plastic. I do not mind this in the least as the printing and colour is far more vibrant the older set, thereby avoiding a model which is entirely brown and boring.&nbsp;There is also the adjustable deck gun which is used to destroy the barge in the film, and this features two flick-fire missiles. On the rear deck, which is raised a little, is a railing mounted gun, this can be controlled by a Minifigure using a pair of handlebars. This entire section is removable and with the sides down, this leaves plenty of room for placing Minifigures inside. Underneath are several wheels which allow the model to roll along with ease, a feature absent from the older barge and a welcome addition on this occasion.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>While the actual model is excellent in my opinion, it could be a little bigger, and the price is&nbsp;too high for what is included. The Minifigure selection is superb, and although they may not be universally popular as some&nbsp;are fairly obscure, they all look fantastic and are suitably accurate to the movie.</p>

<p>Beside <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9496-1"">9496</a> Desert Skiff this model is too small, although I do not think the scaling is too bad personally, as to create models which are perfectly to scale the Sail Barge would have to be at least double the price. I am throwing down the gauntlet to anybody out there who might construct a full Minifigure scale model.</p>

<p>As the only Original Trilogy set released this Summer, and most likely the final in the selection of Jabba the Hutt related sets, this is a wonderful model, and if you can purchase it on sale then I would not hesitate to buy it. For Original Trilogy fans therefore <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75020-1"">75020</a> Jabba&#39;s Sail Barge is highly recommended, although if you are a fan of the Prequel Trilogy too, then I might choose <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75021-1"">75021</a> Republic Gunship over this set, despite the slightly higher price point of that model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: <strong>4.5</strong> - There is a nice selection of brown and tan parts, as well as the rare blue ice cream and some superb new Minifigure components, so there should be enough to keep one interested in this set for its part-out value.</p>

<p>Playability: <strong>5</strong> - The easy access to the interior and numerous play features give this set a high play value in my opinion.</p>

<p>Building Experience: <strong>4.5</strong> - There are plenty of interesting techniques&nbsp;used here and I enjoyed how the set is constructed in modular sections.</p>

<p>Value for Money: <strong>3.5</strong> - &pound;99.99 or $119.99 seems only slightly high for 850-pieces, however the size of the model one is left with is a little disappointing and I think there are better sets at this price point than this one.</p>

<p>Overall: <strong>4</strong> - The only major issue here is the price, at perhaps &pound;79.99 or $99.99, this set would be awarded with full marks, as it is, this is a serious flaw and it badly damages the set as a whole in my opinion.</p>

Read this review to find out what's off about this set!<div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>The Build (Building experience): </b>Let's just say this ones not for little kids. It'd be wise to stick to the age specifications on the box. The wings were<b>&nbsp;INCREDIBLY</b>&nbsp;hard to put on. But its very sound structure makes it a great playset for little kids. So if you're a parent looking to buy a lego set for a little tyke to play with, if you decide this one, build it first, if they try building this, they'll throw a tantrum!</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Parts:</b>&nbsp;There weren't many new parts in this set. The light gray wing connectors and the little dark gray pieces (also included in 75001) were the only two pieces I could think of off the top of my head. But most of the minifigures are new, I just simply love the new printing on the skiff guard torso piece and Max Rebo and Ree-Yees' heads.</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Playability:</b>&nbsp;This set has much playability yet to be told in this review! But first, let's start by saying that this set does not have many feature ""features"" (mechanisms). But wait! This set has a boatload ( haha, get it?) of entertainment from bow to stern! The only really notable mechanism on this set is the front cannon. I love how LEGO positioned the slant pieces in such a way that the cannon slides back and forth with ease. Of course you can take the cannon out and fire the little red pellets, but that's a different story. We'll talk about that later. Now on the more dollhousey parts of this set. Much like a dollhouse, this little ship can open up and reveal a kitchen, Jabba's private lounge, the way in, (or dungeon, not sure which :/) Max Rebo's music room, (where his drums are located) and the top (we'll talk about the top later). Now, a quick weapons directory. Not many weapons. First, the cannon we talked about. Now here's a flaw; there's no way to fire the cannon from inside the ship. Of course, it's removable, so that says a lot about it right there. But when you do remove it, load one of the red 1x1 cylinders into the front of the cannon. The here comes the exciting part. IT'S NOT FLICK FIRE! You just pull the little ball back and BOOM! When you let it go, the stud will go zooming out. It works well too. The other two weapons are located on the top of the ship, so we will be getting to those right now! The second weapon is sort of a minigun. Located on the left wing, it's cool how LEGO built it onto the wing instead of making it a little knickknack that will eventually clutter your house. Dosen't shoot, though, just there for looks. The last weapon is the iconic gun for episode VI. The one that Leia blows this very ship up with if you've watched the movies. They didn't do a great job on it though.</div><div>It just swivels and has two oversized flick fire missiles (sigh). Those things are getting SO old! Otherwise, there's not much on the top. Just two poseable sails and the ability to disconnect the top from the bottom (easily! ;) ).</div><div><br></div><div><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span><b>Minifigs:</b>&nbsp;This set has 6 minifigures. Which include Jabba the hutt, Max Rebo, slave Leia,</div><div>Ree-Yees, Skiff guard, and of course, waiter R2-D2.

"Firox_5000","2014-01-11T17:30:15.35Z","The Sail Barge ","This is a model I was given by relatives during Christmas, which the 4th biggest Star Wars set of 2013 and 1st remake of the original 2006 model.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><b>Box/ packaging.&nbsp;</b></div><div>The set is packaged in a fair sized rectangular box, which is quite a lot smaller than previous £100 sets and about the same size as past £80 sets such as the pod racers and Fury Class Interceptor.</div><div><br></div><div>There are six numbered bags and two instruction manuals which come in their own packaging to protect it from wear and tear before opening.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Building experience.</b></div><div>The construction itself is split in to sections with the first four completing the shell of the barge and last two finishing the sides and floor. It takes approximately 2 hours to finish the building process. There's a lot of &nbsp;snot techniques used and a mix of different building techniques altogether.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures</b></div><div>There are six mini figures included in this set, five of which are unique to this model.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first one is Jabbas the hut who isn't unique to this set or even a new, but is still a great figure with his giant tail piece and his articulated face too.</div><div><br></div><div>The second is Princess Leia in slave girl outfit. Who features a new plaited hair piece with golden elements as well as front and back torso printing of the slave clothing she's wearing which has a slight glossy shine to it.</div><div><br></div><div>The third figure is Max Rebo, who is a completely new figure and exclusive to this set. He comes in a very light blue colour. He features a rubbery head piece with a long like trunk and ears and a back piece as well. There is no torso or leg printing, but this figure doesn't need it.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The fourth figure is a weequay skiff guard, who features a serious face with lots of markings and wrinkles and also with a silver'ish hair piece printed on the back. He also features a printed torso with belt and badges whilst &nbsp;there are shirt printings and more hair at the back.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The fifth is Ree-Yees, another new figure who includes a new slightly rubbery face with three eyes and ears at the side. He features light double sided printing on the torso but no leg printing.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The final figure is R2-D2 and whilst appearing in many sets, is unique to this set due to the headpiece which is carrying drinks due to the character current being enslaved as a servant on the sail barge at that time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The model</b></div><div>Like most Star Wars sets, there is only one large scale vehicle included in the set which is the Sail Barge itself. The model can also be moved along by wheels included below the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The ship itself is a fair size although slightly smaller than the 2006 version. There's lots of features throughout. At the front of the set, the nose can be lifted which reveals a firing cannon, which can be taken out of the area, but also be hidden when the front is closed again.</div><div><br></div><div>The sides of the sail barge can be lowered down easily to open the barge area easier access and role play to reveal the inside. The windows at the side also open and close also. Details within include a prison cell, cooking area and storage box, a sitting area for Jabba (which could also double as a dance floor) and Max Rebo's musical instrument itself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The upper level of the sail barge includes two mounted guns, one connected to the side of the and the other in the centre of the roof , which are flick missiles. There's also the sails themselves which are connected by poles which can be moved around in different positions in display. The sails themselves are made of a plastic material.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion</b></div><div>Overall, it's a pretty good set with a great selection of minifigures and though slightly smaller than the first, is still a great model with lots of features and detail packed in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For £100, I think the set is rather expensive and almost too much in terms of buying it at full price considering the old one was slightly bigger and £40 less, so I think a more reasonable price point would be £80 considering it's actually similar size to the At-Te which is £20 cheaper.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Other flaws are The roof is a little bit flimsy and there could have maybe been another skiff included in the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But putting these aside, it's a set I would recommend.

"wii1232","2014-04-23T21:52:21.35Z","Not to Scale With Minifigures","<p>This set DEFINITELY compares to the 2006 6212 Jabba&#39;s Sail Barge in lots of ways.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is exceptionally big, considering the fact that it houses not only the pieces &amp; 2 instruction booklets, but also a poster, which shows on one side a scene of sets 75020 and 9496 Desert Skiff in the fight above the Sarlacc pit, and on the other side, a list of all the 2013 LEGO Star Wars minifigures.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There were not enough parts to scale this model appropriately, because in the movie, there was actually room to walk around inside the barge! &nbsp;Not just room for a jail, kitchen, Jabba spot and Max Rebo&nbsp;spot! &nbsp;Because if R2&nbsp;is going to serve drinks to the guests on the barge, then he should have room to roll around in.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Speaking of which, I have concerns about the minifigures. &nbsp;I believe that there should have been Bib Fortuna and Salacious B. Crumb(unless of course you already have or soon will get 9516 Jabba&#39;s Palace), as well as C-3PO&nbsp;as the speaker &nbsp;and the rest of the Max Rebo Band.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t lengthy, but took about an hour to an hour &amp; 10 minutes. &nbsp;The hardest part I&#39;d say is installing the very rear wheels on the bottom, because they have to be attached to an axle&nbsp;in the center, &nbsp;and attached to a hole on the other side, via a pin. &nbsp;Everything else went pretty on smoothly&nbsp;to the end.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model like I said in the Parts section, were not to scale the minifigures&#39; height. &nbsp;For example, on the top deck, if you stand a normal size minifigure on there, there head is within a centimeter of the front tip of the sail it&#39;s under. &nbsp;And positioning the sails upright just looks downright stupid. &nbsp;But I&#39;m saying that Leia can&#39;t stand on the gun turret to blow it up if her head touches the front tip of the rear sail. &nbsp;LEGO should have thought about that more, &amp; expanded the size of the entire barge, before agreeing and releasing this set into stores.</p>

<p>Another thing they should have done is replace the wheels with translucent lego pieces, to make the barge appear to hover more. &nbsp;Because when I watch the movie Return of the Jedi, the Sail Barge is a good meter or two above the sand while in tact. &nbsp;For the set, they could have put in 4-5 of the circular ones(the ones they put in 9496 and 6212 to make the skiff appear to hover above the sand).</p>

<p>But the shootable cannon in the front, windows, removable deck, jail, kitchen, rear cannon, and detailing give this set a 4 rating.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion is that it&#39;s on a scale of 1-5, 1 being excellent, and 5 being poor, I give this set a great opinion. &nbsp;So a 4. &nbsp;I would only recommend it if you like the Jabba stuff sets. &nbsp;I wasn&#39;t geeky about it, but I was happily satisfied.</p>

"Fauch","2015-09-17T00:58:07.06Z","A pirate ships with 2 decks?","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Large amount of brown pieces here, also a decent amount of tan and dark tan. There is obviously a large amount of slopes on the front (I guess it&#39;s the front), many 2x3 tiles with clips and lots of hinges. the 6x8 technic bricks are nice too. This sets is mostly built from plates, so it doesn&#39;t have an impressive amount of bricks (though there is a nice 12 studs wide arch)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs are mostly good but few are great. Leia probably has the best printing, while others have ok but not outstanding prints (the blue elephant, max it seems, doesn&#39;t even have prints, though the color is nice)</p>

<p>What really stand out are some pieces which are unique to this set. the 2 moulded alien heads are great, the 3 eyed one looks amazing imo. Leia&#39;s hair is great too, rubber piece with some gold printing.</p>

<p>But the biggest stand out is Jabba himself, that face has lots of great details.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>An unusual build. You begin with a technic frame, and the &quot;walls&quot; are built out of plates and attached to the frame with hinges. the inside is a more traditionnal build and this is where most of the bricks are used.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I saw the movie long ago (I think when episode 3 came out, so I don&#39;t know how accurate this is), but it looks good, though from the outside, it looks a lil bit plain with all that brown. I like the idea of a &quot;pirate boat&quot; with an indoor section.</p>

<p>Playability-wise, I imagine it would be great. It&#39;s like a pirate ship, with cannons and sails, but it&#39;s also a base at the same time with a kitchen and prison inside. The side&nbsp;panels&nbsp;can be opened and the top removed for accessibility.&nbsp;Also it has wheels for better manoeuvrability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set, even if you are not into Star Wars, though the RRP is ridiculous.</p>
