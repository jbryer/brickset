<p>In this review, I will be taking a look at <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75021-1"">75021</a> Republic Gunship, which was perhaps the most anticipated set of the entire Summer 2013 Star Wars line-up. Much like many of the other sets from this wave, it is only fairly recently that LEGO last produced a Republic Gunship model (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7676-1"">7676</a>) which was released in 2008. As one of the most prevalent and iconic vehicles from the Prequel Trilogy, previous editions of the Republic Gunship have proved to be very popular indeed, and I would imagine that this set will continue in this vein as it only&nbsp;improves on the earlier models in my opinion.</p>

<p>This is the largest edition of the Republic Gunship so far with 1175-pieces. Naturally though, with a greater piece count comes a higher price, and this set costs &pound;109.99 or $119.99, so is significantly more expensive&nbsp;than either of the Republic Gunship sets released before if you are in the UK, the US price has remained the same. Not only do I consider this set to be&nbsp;the best edition of the Republic Gunship yet, but the minifigures are also outstanding, and five of them are brand new and exclusive which only furthers their appeal.</p>

<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>The box is of course fairly large given the size of the set, although it is not as big as I had expected and is distinctly smaller than the box from the 2008 edition of the Republic Gunship. On the cover, the vehicle can be seen sweeping over the Geonosian plains in a particularly action packed shot. The standard green border and minifigure gallery are also present, with five of the seven minifigures being labelled as &#39;new.&#39; Also, unique to this box and that of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75020-1"">75020</a> Jabba&#39;s Sail Barge, is an advertisement for the poster contained within.</p>

<p>The back of the box displays the Republic Gunship from another aspect, as well as demonstrating the many features of the set. One image in particular caught my eye and that is the shot of Obi-Wan, Anakin and Padm&eacute;&nbsp;all going into battle in the top right hand corner of the reverse&nbsp;of the box.</p>

<p>Inside the box one finds nine numbered bags, and a cardboard backed package containing two instruction booklets, the poster and of course the sticker sheet, which is thankfully not particularly large. The poster is double sided and can be seen below. On one side is a gallery of all 62 minifigures released this year which looks fantastic, and on the other is a slightly odd panoramic view of the Battle of Geonosis. This shot has been created in the style of a painting, and is quite eye-catching.&nbsp;I find it slightly strange that LEGO chose to include a poster as if it has been painted, although I do not think it is fooling anybody.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>The minifigures included in this set are going to be one of the main draws for the product as they are excellent and the majority are exclusive. The <strong>Anakin Skywalker</strong> minifigure is superb, and he looks fairly accurate to his on-screen counterpart. His hairpiece is perhaps the biggest flaw in this minifigure as it is not entirely appropriate when compared with the character as he appears in the film. I must admit however, I am struggling to think of a hairpiece which would suit his unique haircut from Episode II. The head is lovely with printing on both sides. One has a very slight smile, while the other side is printed with a grimace for going into battle. Both sides have brown eyebrows and some cheek definition.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9065845346/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7429/9065845346_f3faa2ef72_n.jpg"" style=""height:300px; width:316px"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9065842602/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7301/9065842602_2243f153db_n.jpg"" style=""height:300px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso continues the detail, with Anakin&#39;s dark brown Jedi robes captured very effectively. His Padawan braid is printed&nbsp;along with an elaborate belt on the front and back. His legs are printed with a continuation of the torso design and he carries a green lightsaber, the one given to him during the Battle in the Petranaki&nbsp;Arena.</p>

<p>The next minifigure is that of <strong>Obi-Wan Kenobi</strong> in his Episode II attire. The hairpiece used is perfect, cast in dark orange and accurately representing Obi-Wan as he appears in the film. His head is the same as that used in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=9494-1"">9494</a> Anakin&#39;s Jedi Interceptor and has a double sided head like Anakin. One expression is decidedly serious, the other is angry. The torso is fairly standard but is still not lacking in detail or accuracy on the front or back with some lovely creasing and a simple belt. His legs are printed with a continuation of the torso design and this finishes the minifigure off nicely. Obi-Wan comes with a simple blue lightsaber as an accessory.</p>

<p><strong>Padm&eacute;&nbsp;Amidala</strong> was probably the most anticipated minifigure to come out with this set, being the first ever version of Padm&eacute;&nbsp;as she appears on Geonosis. Her hairpiece is brand new and is incredibly accurate to the film in shaping and colour. She too has a double sided head, with one face printed with a slight smile, and&nbsp;a toothy grin on the other. She has some pink lipstick and even a couple of beauty spots which shows impressive attention to detail.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9063610497/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/9063610497_50dab314d4_n.jpg"" style=""height:296px; width:320px"" /></a> <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9063608117/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2873/9063608117_c972804936_n.jpg"" style=""height:296px; width:293px"" /></a></p>

<p>Her torso is printed front and back with her ripped shirt which is also very accurate, complete with scratch marks inflicted by the Nexu on her back. I thought the fact that she has one white arm and one flesh arm to represent a sleeve being missing was also a nice touch. Her legs are plain white with no printing and she comes equipped with a standard blaster.</p>

<p>My favourite minifigure of the set is in fact the <strong>Clone Trooper Captain</strong>. The dark red highlights on the armour look absolutely fantastic in my opinion. His helmet is printed with some excellent designs, the visor is silver in colour and is trimmed with dark red. He includes a few small air intakes and there are holes on either side of his helmet for the attachment of Clone Trooper equipment should you wish. His head beneath the helmet is the same as any Clone Trooper, with a determined expression and bushy black eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9065832124/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5450/9065832124_3d1c438e30_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso is identical to that of a standard Clone Trooper but for the addition of four red dots on his chest armour. There are plenty of lovely details including a rather nice belt which is laden with various pouches and even a grenade on his back. The addition of a few light grey shadows is unobtrusive but serves to break up the otherwise almost entirely white armour and looks fantastic. His arms are dark red to match his helmet and his legs are plain white with black hips. He is equipped with the LEGO interpretation of a DC-15A Blaster Rifle which consists of a large blaster with a Technic pin attached to extend the barrel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also get a <strong>Clone Trooper Pilot</strong> which is a nice inclusion. His helmet is perfect but for one thing, and that is the fact that the fin on his helmet is present whereas in the film it is not. This would require an entirely new mould of course but it seems to me that if you can create a new mould for Padm&eacute;&#39;s hair then LEGO could have created a new mould for this. Nevertheless, the helmet looks superb other than this detail as it has a smattering of grilles and dials which are accurate to the film, as well as a rather lovely patch of yellow above his visor. A pair of red Republic symbols are also included which look excellent. His head is the same as that of any Clone Trooper, with black eyebrows and a determined expression as mentioned earlier.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9063603795/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5445/9063603795_7f6da05512_n.jpg"" style=""height:294px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso is printed with some excellent detailing, including the life support pack which is unique to the Clone Pilot, as well as the standard armour and belt. As usual, the back of the torso is printed with a continuation of the armour and belt designs. His hips are black and the legs are plain white. He comes equipped with a small blaster pistol for self defence too. I do have another inevitable complaint however, quite why LEGO were unable to include two Clone Pilots to fill the two spaces for them is beyond me, but this is an improvement over including no Clone Pilots as in the last two minifigure scale models of the Republic Gunship.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have two <strong>Super Battle Droids</strong>, which are exactly the same as they have been since 2007, cast in pearl dark grey. In this set, they are equipped with the standard arms rather than with the cannon arm which was included in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8018-1"">8018</a> Armoured Assault Tank (AAT).&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9065784960/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/9065784960_16b9d63b53_n.jpg"" style=""height:273px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>There are some interesting moments during this build as one might expect of a larger set. It takes about three hours and contains a pleasing mixture of System and Technic building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favourite kind of construction is one where you build a section as indicated in the instruction manual and it will only become apparent&nbsp;what its purpose is when you attach it to the rest of the model. Just such an occasion took place here for me while constructing the innards of the vehicle and there are plenty of SNOT (studs not on top) building techniques&nbsp;as well as a nice diversity of orientations for construction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, while there may be pleasing moments, it must also be remembered that as this is a symmetrical vehicle there is a great deal of mirrored building, which can become a little dull at times. Nevertheless, overall the building of the Republic Gunship is enjoyable in the main.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>When complete, this is an impressive vehicle from just about every angle. When in action in Episode II, the Republic Gunship inspires awe as it cleaves through swathes of Battle Droids with ease, thus making the ship particularly popular. The LEGO model is very accurate, and is filled with features, so as well as being an attractive display piece, it is also fun to play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The nose of the ship is lime green and two chin mounted guns protect the front of the vehicle. These are placed on ball joints and are very maneuverable, but not at the expense of durability unlike the older editions of this vehicle. The twin cockpits can both open and comfortably seat a Clone Pilot inside to use the control panels which are modeled after the controls seen in the film, although they are stickers unfortunately. Beneath the cockpit section is a space for holding an extra payload of missiles, which seems a little superfluous to me, and the arched doorway through which troops can enter the vehicle. Unfortunately, an opening between the arched area and the compartment to the rear has been sacrificed in favour of a stronger vehicle, which is reasonable in my opinion.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9063597711/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7315/9063597711_c06561f959_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The troop compartment&nbsp;is now completely open inside unlike the last model and has plenty of space for as many as twenty Clone Troopers (at least that is as many as I could fit with them all being attached to at least one stud). A small box fits into the floor of the vehicle in which one finds a Jedi&nbsp;Holocron and there is more storage above the troop bay in the form of four containers. The two side pods which were notably absent from the 2008 model, although this was justified since they were not featured in the Clone Wars very often. On this model however they are included and they look decent, although it still bothers me that they pivot from the underside of the pod rather than from the centre. Each one can fit a Clone Trooper in fairly easily, who can control the composite beam gun using levers.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9065791348/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7447/9065791348_50404e92b3_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>While these turrets are not bad, I personally think I have found a better solution myself, from the perspective&nbsp;of accuracy to the film at least. You can see my own version of a Republic Gunship side pod turret below, and if anybody is interested in the LDD&nbsp;(LEGO Digital Designer) file, I would be happy to send it.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9065808932/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3749/9065808932_3a0aebea4c_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The rear of the ship contains a speeder bike which can be unloaded by dropping the rear hatch. A minifigure can sit on the speeder bike, even while inside the Republic Gunship should you wish. Above the rear hatch is yet another gun turret, this time on a different kind of ball joint, but nevertheless with plenty of movement. There is yet more storage above the rear turret where a small hatch can open in which you can place rifles or whatever equipment you wish.&nbsp;The side doors can open and close from here, although they do not close all the way across the opening, accurate to Episode II. The tips of the wings each have another composite beam turret, in which a minifigure can be seated, although in the film these turrets were remote controlled by the co-pilot/gunner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9063591275/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7302/9063591275_3ac30a327f_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>On top of the vehicle is a carrying handle which folds away nicely and allows one to &#39;swoosh&#39; the ship around with ease. There are also eight flick-fire missiles which are a nice addition for the purpose of&nbsp;playability, and on either side of these are the thrusters which are an attractive mixture of dark red, white and black. The colour scheme of the entire vehicle is very pleasing, white and dark red, without the smattering of bright red which has plagued the last two editions of the Republic Gunship and somewhat ruined the aesthetics.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9063577953/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2808/9063577953_3454ea7272_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>There are flaws in this model. The lack of a second Clone Pilot, the fact that the side pods are not as accurate as I had hoped, and the distinct absence of any standard Clone Troopers to ride in the Republic Gunship. The price is a little higher than I might have hoped too, although there are plenty of improvements which have been made to go some way to explain the dramatic price increase. Perhaps an additional couple of Clone Troopers or another Clone Pilot would have helped to soften the blow quite significantly.</p>

<p>However, despite these few problems, which are fairly insignificant in my opinion, the set as a whole is brilliant. The minifigure selection is wonderful and includes some very desirable characters which are either&nbsp;brand new or perfect for army building. There are several notable improvements over the previous versions of the vehicle, particularly from the point of view of durability, which has been greatly improved by the increased amount of Technic construction used for keeping the structure firm.</p>

<p>Beside previous editions of the Republic Gunship, this model is a similar length and wingspan, although the front of the fuselage narrows unlike on the older versions. The bodywork is dramatically different from earlier editions, although the overall shape is of course very similar and this model will look just fine next to one of the older sets in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9065798740/"" title=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""Review: 75021 Republic Gunship"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7427/9065798740_c40c6082a9_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>In terms of &#39;swooshability&#39;, this set is hard to beat. It is very strong and has some points where one can easily hold the ship, including the useful (and discrete) carrying handle. The playability is as good as it gets and the model is lovely for display as well in my opinion. Therefore, I think this set suits anybody who is a fan of the Prequel Trilogy be they younger or older as much like the &#39;real&#39; ship, it is its versatility which makes it stand out for me.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Parts: <strong>4.5</strong> - Lots of white and a nice selection of dark red pieces.</li>
	<li>Playability: <strong>5</strong> - Loads of features and a great minifigure selection. What could be better?</li>
	<li>Building Experience: <strong>4</strong> - A nice mixture of System and Technic, although there is some repetition.</li>
	<li>Value for Money: <strong>4</strong> - With a larger model comes a higher&nbsp;price, although an&nbsp;additional Clone Pilot would have gone some way to justify the cost.</li>
	<li>Overall: <strong>4.5</strong> - Almost perfect, but a couple of flaws keep it from full marks for me.&nbsp;</li>

"PooPotato","2014-05-18T00:09:00.487Z","The Best Set I Have Purchased Since The Death Star!","<p>As mentioned in my other Summer 2013 line reviews, my main goal was to collect all of the Battle of Geonosis sets, with 75021 Republic Gunship saved for last. &nbsp;I finally had enough money in January, but decided to wait it out for May 4th to see what exclusive figure they would be handing out (I&#39;ve never played KOTR, but Darth Revan looks fantastic), and see if I could get a better deal than the hefty $120.00 price tag. &nbsp;I ended up getting the set for $107, but I guess a lot of other people had the same idea as me because it was back-ordered for a week. &nbsp;Nonetheless it arrived at a reasonable time, and my hopes for an A-List set were fulfilled as soon as I cut open the cardboard shipping box.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box was the largest I have handled since my purchase of 10188 Death Star, so naturally I was a little overwhelmed at the size of it. &nbsp;If you read my review of 75019 AT-TE, I mentioned that the inclusion of a cardboard slab between the instruction booklets and stickers was hoped for in this set, and I got what I wanted! &nbsp;A little orange brick separator was included as well, which is incredibly handy.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Not only was the box my largest since The Death Star, but the amount of pieces was too, dethroning 8098 Clone Turbo Tank, which stood in 2nd place for 4 years. &nbsp;The part selection in this set when compared to 7676 Republic Gunship&nbsp;(I&#39;ll be mainly comparing all aspects of this set to 7676) is much better, with the notable lack of bright red and a ton of dark red/maroon colored pieces to satisfy any scavenger. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>There are five different exclusive minifigures to justify the price of this set, and each one ties in very well with the other Geonosis sets.</p>

<p>Padme makes her first Episode II appearance in this set, and I have to say it was worth the wait! &nbsp;Her hair mold looks new to me, and the inclusion of the scratches on her back from the Nexu was an awesome detail that I didn&#39;t expect Lego to include. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Obi-Wan Kenobi makes his second overall appearance since the now ancient 2002-2003 Episode II line, so naturally he looks way better than his previous counterpart. &nbsp;His Jedi robes are very film-accurate, and back/leg printing is also present, which always makes a better minifigure. &nbsp;This has to be the most film-accurate minifigure&nbsp;I think I have ever purchases, so he is up there with Boba Fett&nbsp;and Clone Trooper Lieutenant on my favorite minifig list.</p>

<p>Anakin Skywalker also makes his second Episode II appearance in this set. &nbsp;His dark brown Jedi robes are very accurate, but as stated in other reviews his hair piece is a little strange when compared to the already eccentric haircut he has in Attack of the Clones. &nbsp;Anakin and Obi-Wan both go wonderfully with 75017 Duel on Geonosis, which in my opinion was made specifically to compliment this set.</p>

<p>The Clone Pilot has always been one of my favorite Clone Troopers considering that my plans for the future include becoming a pilot of sorts. &nbsp;He comes with a sidearm which is always cool.The yellow highlights on his helmet look great, but like mentioned by other reviewers the lack of another for a co-pilot is absolute treason! &nbsp;I do plan on purchasing another one off of eBay at some point, but I feel that I shouldn&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>The Clone Trooper Captain has got to be the coolest minifigure I have gotten in a set for a long time. &nbsp;His dark red accents make his armor look fantastic, and could easily be made to look like Captain Fordo from the famed Clone Wars Microseries that appeared on Cartoon Network some years back. &nbsp;Both the Captain and the Pilot look very good next to their other Clone counterparts.</p>

<p>Two Super Battle&nbsp;Droids are also included, but there isn&#39;t that much to say about them. &nbsp;They are welcome in any droid army, especially when the SBD made it&#39;s debut at the Battle of Geonosis.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build for this set was the most enjoyable one I&#39;ve had since the Death Star, and brought back fond memories of building in complete happiness. &nbsp;The entire structural design, like that of the new AT-TE is a complete overhaul of the older one, with the wings and the nose turrets being firmly attached, and a new carrying handle that only makes it easier to carry this behemoth around.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>When put next to 7676, you can easily tell which set took more time and effort to design. &nbsp;The return of the bubble turrets has been waited for for years, and the new stable design for the rocket launchers (the big spires on top) and the nose turrets are genius. &nbsp;Add this to the relatively small amount of stickers and the great minifigs, this set is an absolute must-have.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>The new design, figures, and colors all match up to make the greatest ship that I have ever purchased. &nbsp;I plan on selling my 7676 so it doesn&#39;t look bad next to this bad-boy, and I should also mention that this set looks amazing next to any Episode II, III, or Clone Wars sets. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Amazing Minifigures</p>

<p>?Great Color Scheme</p>

<p>Strong Design</p>

<p>Much More Film Accurate Than Previous Editions</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>NONE (You will never see this happen again, unless I happen to get my hands on the new AT-AT or a Star Destroyer)</p>

<p>Overall this set is a must-have, and was the perfect end note to an absolutely wonderful product line!</p>

"Tar_Domo","2014-08-31T11:06:10.04Z","""Begun the Clone War Has""","<p>This is the third version of the Republic Gunship and my first. I missed the earlier versions and was happy when this third version came out.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong> Box was big and after building this I could put my smaller complete LEGO things&nbsp;in it. Istructions were in two parts as usually in the big sets.</p>

<p><strong>Parts </strong>Parts are mostly white and standard. There are a few interesting ones also.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong> This comes with seven minifigures. The two Super Battle Droids were a nice add to my droid army. Clones are also good though the gunship would need a Clone Pilot more. It is not that bad if you have Clone Pilots from other sets. Obi-Wan is nicely detailed Episode 2 version as is Anakin and Padm&eacute;. Padm&eacute; is a nice add also because she doesn&acute;t appear in a lot of sets.</p>

<p><strong>The build </strong>Building took quite a lot of time and I built this&nbsp;for many days, not many hours in a row, though.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model </strong>You can put a lot of Clone Troopers into the Gunship as in the Episode 2 when Master Yoda arrives with the Clones. In the gunship there is also a little speeder.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong> This is a good set for Episode 2 collectors and other SW fans.</p>

"SanMams91","2015-04-01T03:00:28.617Z","Favourite LEGO set to date.","<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>We start off with the figures, which are all amazing. I know many will hate the Super Battle Droids, because there are just so many of them, but considering that I have not gotten any in awhile, I appreciate that they were included. Nothing much has changed with them. Despite me harboring no hate towards these, I do feel like they should&#39;ve just given us one or two completely different figures to fit onto the ship. Next, we have Anakin Skywalker. I love the printing on his torso, I even like the hairpiece, but he is, out of all of them, my least favourite figure. That does not, in any way, mean he is a bad figure, because he absolutely is NOT. The other figures are just that amazing. Obi-Wan looks fantastic, the Cone Pilot/Captain have similar helmets, but different printing which I love even more than the Cone Wars versions, and Padm&eacute; is one of the best figures I have ever seen, at least personally. Excellent assortment of figures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about three hours...but they flew by. The build was not only interesting, it was damn fun. I would hate to disassemble the gunship, which I will inevitable have to do, but I can comfort myself in the knowledge that I will build this beauty up again a second time.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>My goodness, what do I say about this...it&#39;s gorgeous. You take it by the hook which is installed on top of the vehicle, swoosh it around, put in whatever other figures you want to put in, there is LOADS of space for others...the playability is astounding and the vehicle is a beauty to look at. Opening compartments make it extra fun.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is the best Star Wars set I own. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve said that since Palpatine&#39;s Shuttle (read my review, then you&#39;ll understand why I just said that), but it truly is. I&#39;m so glad I did not miss out on this set, even though I may have to wait a little longer to purchase another set I was eyeing. All ill say is this: if you find this set, you don&#39;t own it, buy it. It&#39;s expensive, but it is worth it. If its on discount, EVEN BETTER. LEGO has done an outstanding job with this model and it&#39;ll be difficult to find a set that will impress me this much.</p>

"jdawg03","2020-01-14T01:27:15.577Z","Great set","<p>The Republic Gunship was one of the best building experiences I&#39;ve ever had. It went together satisfyingly and didn&#39;t feel repetitive. The play value is great with the carrying handle and all the different parts of the ship that can be manned. The minifig selection is great too, with all the characters needed to recreate the scene from Attack of the Clones. I just wish there were more clones included as well!</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-01-18T16:41:36.95Z","The best set of the Attack of the Clones!","<p>The Republic Gunship is an iconic ship that features in both Star Wars Episode II, Attack of the Clones, and the animated Clone Wars series. The Gunship has appeared 3 times in full scale and multiple times as micro scale models such as microfighters&nbsp;and advent calendar builds.</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of the 7 sets that features Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi together. Altogether, the set has 7 minifigs.</p>

<p>Minifig&nbsp;1: Anakin- his hair piece is a bit odd and is in ginger blonde. His head piece is double-sided with a rye smile and the other side is a frustrated expression. The torso shows a dark Jedi robe with a belt. It is printed on the back as well. The legs are the brown dangling ends of the robes. He is armed with a dark green light sabre with a silver-grey hilt.</p>

<p>Minifig 2: Obi-Wan-his hair&nbsp;is a long ginger piece as shown in Attack of the Clones. His head is bearded and shows a frown on one side; on the other side,&nbsp;he has a frustrated expression. The torso is a light beige Jedi robe and belt. It is also printed on the back. His legs are the beige dangling robe ends. His weapon is a blue light sabre with a silver-grey hilt. This fits in the back of the build whilst he is flying the ship.</p>

<p>Minifig&nbsp;3: Clone Trooper Captain-this minifig&nbsp;is unique to this set. His helmet is outlined in dark red to show his rank. Other than that, it is a normal helmet. The head is a standard clone face. The torso is the normal one apart from 4 red dots to show authority. His arms are the same red. The legs are plain. He is armed with a rifle with a technic pin extension.</p>

<p>Minifig&nbsp;4: Clone Trooper Pilot-this guy&#39;s helmet has 2 republic symbols on it and a yellow outline. He has the standard face. The torso is normal apart from a breathing system. The legs are plain white. He is equipped with a pistol, which can be stored in the back whilst piloting.</p>

<p>Minifig 5: Padm&eacute;-she&nbsp;has a brunette bun hair piece. Her face is double-sided. On one side,&nbsp;she is smiling and on the other, she is creepily grinning. Her torso is a whir crop top with scratch marks on the back. Her legs are plain. She is armed with a&nbsp;blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;6 and 7: Super Battle Droids- they are pearl black with no blaster arms. The clips on the legs are easy to break. I think that they would be better replaced by a Clone Trooper Pilot and another Clone Trooper (normal).</p>

<p>Parts&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the pieces are white with some red and green. There should be a few more green pieces. There are 6 cockpit&nbsp;pieces used. Does use some technic pieces.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>I built this across multiple days and between school hours and probably took at least 3 hours. It was very enjoyable and I would do it again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two wing cockpits where clones can fire missiles from. There are two gun&nbsp;placements that extend and retract from the main body. There are two main cockpits where the pilot and Obi-Wan sit and fly the ship from. The inside is spacious and can carry many troops inside. The two doors can open and close to an extant using a few knobs that jut out from the back. Two small doors at the front can open to reveal a small gun emplacement. There is a back door that folds open to reveal a small speeder for quick getaways. A boot (trunk) like compartment can be used to store weapons.&nbsp;One large technic piece can be used to lift the whole model up.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Minifigs&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Compartments</p>

<p>-Liftable</p>

<p>-Push-out missiles</p>

<p>-Cockpits</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Super Battle Droids</p>

<p>-Huge price but worth it</p>

<p>Overall, the gunship is a must-buy with the unique&nbsp;Clone Captain, secret compartments and the speeder.</p>

"RundownPear","2022-03-22T14:28:28.877Z","A Fan Favorite for Good Reason","<p>This iteration of the Republic Gunship came out during one of Lego&#39;s golden eras. Here we saw many of the most desirable sets in the modern-day come out, and this set is a shining example. This set nails almost every aspect of a system-scale gunship although it under-delivers in a few key areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures are great but also not the best. Obi-Wan, Anakin, and Padme all in one set is something great to see. I really like when all our lead characters are bundled together in one package and I really appreciate that here. There are 2 super battle droids that are slightly random as they don&#39;t really complement the build in any meaningful way but that is the case for most droids in most sets. The issue appears when we take a look at the troopers. The set has the Clone Pilot and Clone Captain. There aren&#39;t enough pilots to pilot the gunship and there aren&#39;t enough clones to man the turrets. This wouldn&#39;t be an issue if there was a suitable battle pack available at the time, the one available had 2 droidekas, a clone sergeant, and a single P1 clone. As for the pilots you were SOL as they wouldn&#39;t be available for cheap for a few more years. Lego often doesn&#39;t include the &quot;correct&quot; amount of figures in certain sets to encourage purchases of other sets however for the 2013 wave there weren&#39;t any other sets that complimented this one in a desirable way. The figure selection is great for collectors but as a playset it leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>The build is substantial and stable. The addition of the handle is a gamechanger compared to previous iterations and unlike its predecessors, the wings are locked into place. Their is ample room for troopers in the main bay and the turrets have great articulation. The ample storage is appreciated and the missile salvos are a nice touch. It is slightly larger than true Minifigure scale but it scales great with other sets. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the inaccurate speeder but it is a compromise I prefer compared to how they handled it in the 2008 version. A lot of the white bricks along the spine have a tendency to crack with time which is something to be aware of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is a must-have for any prequel fan. In the context of 2013 the figure selection was less than ideal however looking back on it from a collectors POV its perfect. The build is large and sturdy with some great shaping and details. There is little to not like about this set other than its aftermarket price.&nbsp;</p>
