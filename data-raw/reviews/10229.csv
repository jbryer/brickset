<p>Probably the set I considered the least interesting&nbsp;prior to the release of this Summer wave of Star Wars sets was <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75022-1"">75022</a> Mandalorian Speeder. The vehicle being recreated appeared only briefly in the Clone Wars television show (or at least a similar vehicle) and the box artwork for the set does not, in my opinion, portray the model or Minifigures in the most complimentary of light.</p>

<p>Despite my initial reservations, this has turned out to be a good little set, priced at &pound;24.99 or $24.99 and consisting of 211-pieces. As a Clone Wars set, this will no doubt not be quite as popular as many other sets in this selection, and it will be viewed as good news by some that only two Clone Wars sets have been produced for this Summer wave.&nbsp;I was pleased to see a Clone Wars version of Darth Maul being produced before the end of the Clone Wars sets as a whole, but the Minifigure is a little disappointing in my opinion (although I believe it does look better in person than in photos).</p>

<hr />
<hr />
<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>The box for this set is fairly small and the bags are densely packed inside. As I have already mentioned, the box artwork does not do the actual set justice. In my opinion, the angle at which the speeder has been photographed is rather unflattering and the colouration seems dark and gloomy as a whole. The green border brings a welcome splash of colour and there is plenty of action going on around the speeder which is always nice. The standard Minifigure gallery also features, and all three figures are labelled as &#39;new.&#39;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9394289281/"" title=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7354/9394289281_74d6cb389d_n.jpg"" style=""height:232px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>On the back of the box are some more shots of the set and the various features are displayed as one would expect. There is a single instruction booklet, a small sticker sheet (which are not cardboard backed unfortunately) and&nbsp;three&nbsp;unnumbered bags.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>There are three Minifigures included in this set, two of which are almost identical. The most interesting of the three is definitely <strong>Darth Maul</strong>, although he is not in my opinion the highlight. His head has been a source of much complaint as it is fairly ugly, although I personally find it acceptable in comparison with many other Clone Wars face prints. The eyes are&nbsp;printed a little too far apart and his mouth is smaller than I would have liked, but I do not think it is as bad as it looks from images of the set. His head is topped with a Zabrak horned component which is printed to match up with the printing on the face.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9394283295/"" title=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5451/9394283295_85c24c3ef4_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:315px"" /></a></p>

<p>The torso is an excellent component, printed with the metallic collar which adorns the character in the Clone Wars and all the tattoos which make Maul quite so intimidating. These tattoos are even continued onto his arms which looks excellent and the designs are of course on the back of the torso too. However, it is the legs&nbsp;which brings this figure down most of all in my opinion. Despite being moulded with huge amounts of detail and looking incredible, complete with clawed feet and pistons, they are quite simply far too long. This means that the entire Minifigure looks very much taller than he ought to and his legs are quite severely out of proportion with his body. They can be posed much like a standard LEGO Minifigure, albeit with a slightly wider range of motion than usual. He is armed with a single bladed red Lightsaber which is accurate to reflect the fact that half of his double bladed Lightsaber was cut off by Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars Episode I. Maul is also equipped with a Darksaber&nbsp;stolen from Pre Vizsla, the former leader of Death Watch. It is unfortunate to note that while Maul&#39;s brother Savage Opress&nbsp;is significantly taller than Darth Maul in the television show, their Minifigures do not reflect this and Maul is far taller than Opress.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9397048096/"" title=""012 by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""012"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5461/9397048096_61f3fe311e_n.jpg"" style=""height:299px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The other two Minifigures included are identical but for their faces beneath the helmets. The <strong>Mandalorian Super Commando</strong> is the highlight of this set for me, as it really does look excellent, despite appearing only fairly briefly much like the speeder they are riding in. The helmet is the same design as that of every other Mandalorian released up to now, but is printed with a unique design. It is cast in pearl dark grey and printed with black and dark red highlights. Perhaps the best part of the printing however is the black handprint which adorns the helmet and makes them look rather rugged as a whole. The head underneath varies between the Minifigures as mentioned earlier, one has the standard Mandalorian head (which is exceedingly unattractive) and the other utilises Pre Vizsla&#39;s head from <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9525-1"">9525</a> Pre Vizsla&#39;s Mandalorian Starfighter.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9397044680/"" title=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5550/9397044680_50b468a3bd_n.jpg"" style=""height:242px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>A pearl dark grey jetpack is worn which is moulded with lots of detail, but is without printing. The torso is printed with the same design as other Mandalorians, but on this occasion with a black shirt and dark grey armour (which is continued on the back of the torso, although this is obscured by the jetpack). A red splatter is printed across the armour which again contributes to the untidy and mercenary appearance of the character. The legs are plain dark grey which contrasts nicely with the red and black of the torso. Each Minifigure is armed with a standard short blaster. I am very impressed by these two Minifigures, they are very accurate to how the characters appear in the relevant episodes of the Clone Wars and in LEGO they look perfect.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>As a set with only 211-pieces, little can be expected from the build, although it is a fairly entertaining half an hour build given the size of the set. The construction of the windscreen, which is on a hinge joint, is quite clever, allowing it to be placed at a particularly sleek angle. Furthermore, the use of windows as engines at the back looks great and is a very effective technique in my opinion.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>The vehicle may be somewhat obscure, but it is nevertheless excellent, for display in particular. What it may lack in features it more than makes up for in accuracy in my opinion. Beneath the front of the speeder are a pair of flick fire missiles which can be launched by pushing a tab forwards on either side of the vehicle. In the cockpit is a holoprojector and seating for Darth Maul and his two Mandalorian Super Commandos, as well as room for them to store their guns.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9397041476/"" title=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7361/9397041476_5279ab83b1_n.jpg"" style=""height:240px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>At the rear of the vehicle is a turret, behind which a Minifigure can be placed to control the weapon. This weapon can be moved up and down but unfortunately there is no swivelling motion. On either side are air intakes and thrusters, which look fantastic, and below the turret is a storage area for Darth Maul&#39;s Lightsaber and the stolen Darksaber which is very welcome.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9394267811/"" title=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7321/9394267811_015066d7f9_n.jpg"" style=""height:209px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>I would certainly recommend this set as not only does it include a couple of rather impressive Minifigures (particularly the Mandalorian Super Commandos in my opinion) but the actual speeder too is truly excellent. The sleek lines and attractive colour scheme make this a perfect display piece, although I think this set does lack a little when it comes to playability thanks to the lack of many features on the speeder and the fact that all three Minifigures are of the same faction, so there is not much room for conflict in this set.</p>

<p>The vehicle appeared only fairly briefly in the Clone Wars as I have already mentioned, during a rather dynamic chase through the skies of Mandalore in the Season 5 episode &#39;The Lawless&#39; and later on to deliver Darth Maul and his brother Savage Opress to a landing platform. So obscure is this vehicle in fact, that it does not have an entry on Wookieepedia or the Star Wars website. The only image I can find of it anywhere is <a href=""http://starwars.com/img/explore/the-clone-wars/slideshow/ep516/gallery/mandalore-supercommandos-03.jpg"">this one</a> on the Star Wars website. The vehicle in the episode does not appear to have the gun turret seen on this model, I suppose this is a slight variation on the same model of speeder.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9397030240/"" title=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""75022 Mandalorian Speeder"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5456/9397030240_0632fe0295_n.jpg"" style=""height:233px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>It is tricky to avoid drawing comparisons between this set and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8128-1"">8128</a>&nbsp;Cad Bane&#39;s Speeder. Each model is constructed with minimal features, but plenty of detail and room for several Minifigures inside, as well as being at the ideal scale for the Minifigures. Some people prefer playset style models, but I am a huge aficionado of this kind of set created at Minifigure scale. Accuracy is&nbsp;important in a Star Wars set for me, although features are equally important which is where both <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8128-1"">8128</a> and this model, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75022-1"">75022</a>, fall a little short in my opinion.</p>

<p>Naturally, if you are not a fan of the Clone Wars then this is a set which you can probably afford to miss, although it is certainly well worth having if you are a Clone Wars fan, not least because it is the only set in which Darth Maul is available in his Clone Wars guise, even if he is a little disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: <strong>3.5</strong>&nbsp;- A fair smattering of dark blue and Darth Maul&#39;s legs are the only components of real interest as far as I can see, so nothing ground-breaking.</p>

<p>Playability: <strong>3.5</strong> - I would not count this set among&nbsp;the most exciting of this wave when it comes to playability. The vehicle is nice and swooshable but that is about it.</p>

<p>Building Experience: <strong>4</strong> - A couple of neat techniques are used, about as much as one could expect from a set this size.</p>

<p>Value for Money: <strong>4.5</strong> - I have no complaints on the price, it seems fair&nbsp;for three Minifigures and a large speeder.</p>

<p>Overall: <strong>4</strong> - Had Darth Maul been a slightly better Minifigure, this set would have been nigh on perfection. Nevertheless, the speeder is lovely, as are those Mandalorian Super Commandos.</p>

"Xendor173","2013-08-22T12:48:47.593Z","Darth Maul Returns!","<p>A few days ago, I got this set for about twenty-five dollars. Compared to most of the sets today, I think that is a descent price. A good size, the speeder carries many different functions.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The Box is nice to handle. However, it doesn't give good enough of a review to attract a lot of attention.</p><p>The instructions are highly detailed, and easy to follow. However, it makes the mistake of assuming that the Mandalorians are the same. I'll explain later.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are no new parts for the speeder. The only new parts are Darth Maul's legs, and hip joint.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>As I mentioned earlier, the instructions made a mistake with the Mandalorians. It says that both Mandalorians come with Pre Visla's head. That is not the case. The other Mandalorian&nbsp;has the normal Mandalorian head.</p><p>Darth Maul is a more interesting figure. In Star Wars Episode I, Darth Maul was cut right above the waist. Later, during the Clone Wars, his brother, Savage Opress, finds him and returns him to Mother Talzin. Talzin then gave Darth Maul a new pair of legs, the ones you see in this set. However, Darth Maul looses these legs in a battle against Obi-Wan, and gets a different, smaller pair of legs from Death Watch. Even so, this Darth Maul was a good choice, since many probably were more impressed with the Night Brother Darth Maul.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was quite entertaining. What impressed me most was the simple design for the windshield and exhaust-thrusts. The design is quite simple, and it took about twenty-minuets to build.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Completed, the set looks really nice. The only downside I see with this set is the fact that the gun cannot turn.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Altogether, this set turned out better than I expected. Even so, the best thing about this set is the Darth Maul minifigure. Now I realize that some people complain that this Darth Maul minifigure is too tall, because he is taller than Savage Opress, but I would have to say otherwise. When Savage was transformed by the Night Sisters, he was made into a mountainous monster. In my opinion, Savage is too short.</p><p>All in all, I would say 90% worth it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

"Odeinoichus","2014-01-05T17:51:08.61Z","The Dark Side is Strong with this One","<p><strong>Set #75022 Mandalorian Speeder: </strong>2013 has given us a lot of Star Wars sets, some which are great, some which are so-so and some which work ok for what they are. I consider this to be a fairly decent set, but the big draw for this one is the Mini-Figures more than the Model... At least in my opinion.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>A Speeder is a rather dull vehicle to try and sell, there are variations of many types of Speeders and while LEGO does a pretty good job of making them look exciting on the box designs these are still just speeders. The box makes it look quite impressive, it does the job of making you eager to own the set.</p>
<p>The instructions are not protected, as always in most sets, and they aren't that thick compared to similar sets in this size class/price range. It's easy to follow the steps and I didn't find any areas that were problematic. The back has some cross-promotions and a code for LEGO Star Wars .com like all the sets from this year, there aren't any Mini-Figure checklists this time though, just a checklist for the sets from the Summer Wave.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There aren't really any parts that stand out to me in this set, it's all pretty standard and just about the only thing that stands out from this set parts wise are the Mini-Figures honestly. I'd wager some of the parts you could find alternative uses for, I'm just not seeing much to offer here.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Like most 30$ Star Wars sets this one includes 3 Mini-Figures. Being based on the Clone Wars naturally these are the more cartoon based versions of characters. All of them are new to the set though, which is a real bonus.</p>
<p>First off we have Mandalorian Super Commando, these are members of the Death Watch who have become part of Darth Maul's criminal syndicate (from what I remember of that season) and they have some pretty good prints. I really like the darker tones for these Death Watch members with the dark black and silver printing on the helmet and double-sided torso. Each Super Commando has the new jetpack piece in a nice shiny metallic looking colour and the red markings Maul added to their helmets and chests really stands out.</p>
<p>Each Super Commando shares the exact same printing except for the heads, these heads are reused (I believe) from the Mandalorian Starfighter set, so one of them is actually the same head as Pre Vizsla (even though he's not meant to be) and the other is a generic Super Commando head based on the Mandalorian Warrior heads.</p>
<p>Darth Maul is brand new and has some superb printing, he has the lower robotic torso seen in the Clone Wars for the waist piece and legs, I'm not quite sure if these are the same used for General Grievous' Clone Wars Mini-Figure or completely brand new. The last Grievous Mini-Fig I've gotten, in fact the only one I own is from around 2008 or so before they introduced the new build for him, so yeah, not sure if they share parts. But still some great legs for Maul nevertheless.</p>
<p>His torso piece is the crown jewel for Maul, it's a double-sided bare chested torso with side-arm printing all in red and black, it's just a goregeous sight to behold. The facial printing is nice too, even if it is single-sided. The unique head piece for this Sith alien is made of a softer rubbery plastic and works great for his trademark horns, it looks great on him and there's a spare for older Maul Mini-Figs who may have only had hoods to wear, so that's a nice bonus. His lightsaber is the same as other Sith, he also has Pre Viszla's Darksaber and I'm afraid here I think the accessory just doesn't work as well, it's basically a black bladed Lightsaber which makes it look less unique than the actual model from the show.</p>
<p>Here I kind of wish LEGO had sculped a single piece bladed weapon, or re-used one from the Ninjago line if necessary that would have had the proper profile and blade shape for the weapon. Oh well, we can't always get new pieces I guess.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>This is not a numbered bag set, so basically you're going to have to seperate all the bricks before starting into colours and shapes and stuff. The build itself isn't very exciting, I mean it's basically just an overgrown landspeeder, sure it's different from the more iconic landspeeder seen in A New Hope, but it's still not the best.</p>
<p>Also the fact that there are stickers for details instead of printed elements is a really unfortunate choice, I think printed elements would have improved this set a lot more.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The Mandalorian Speeder at least looks nice, the colour choices make the model look pretty impressive and the turret on top is a nice, non-flick fire weapon. (They hide the flick-fire missiles underneath the front driver's section, which is a big plus because it means they aren't obvious or impact the look of the speeder.)</p>
<p>I also like the fact you have a compartment for Maul's weapons to clip in in the back, there's even two clips that could potentially be used to store the Mandalorians weapons behind the driver. All in all though I just don't find this vehicle as exciting as some of the other ones, the speeders from Bounty Hunter Pursuit were a lot funner to build and play with compared to this one, it's such a large vehicle too it seems a little too big honestly.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall this is a great set to find on sale because of the Mini-Figures, which are all fun and great additions to the Star Wars Mini-Figure collection. The problems I have with this set is that once it's built there isn't as much to do with it compared to other Star Wars sets in this price range, at least the A-wing is an iconic ship, if you aren't a fan of the Clone Wars designs then you can pretty much skip this set.</p>
<p>The lack of proper printed details and use of stickers knocks the rank for this set too, I think some actual printing would have been much better in this particular instance. Mildly recommended for fans of the Clone Wars or those who love great Mini-Figures and an ok model for display or modification/MOCing.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"VaderFan2187","2016-10-27T22:53:05.11Z","Sleek and Swooshable!!","<p>When I first saw this set, I chose it because of one reason: Cyborg Darth Maul. Yeah, I was relatively new to Lego back then, so I didn&#39;t really think through much when picking sets. But, boy, was this good.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is nice, you build from the bottom up. It is cool and informative to see how to create that sleek profile the speeder exhibits.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are several earth blue pieces in this set, but there is also a fair share of grey and black. Nothing too special, but nothing too bad either.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This set is really awesome to play with. Its sleek profile screams &quot;Pick me up and swoosh me around!!&quot; All 3 minifigures can be seated in the speeder. It&#39;s very hard, nearly impossible, to make a minifig hold the handles of the cannon at the back, but that doesn&#39;t bug me. I&#39;m happy when you can put all the figures into one set. Even better, there are clips for the Mandalorian&#39;s blasters and a secret storage space under the turret for Maul&#39;s sabers. Click hinges open up the back to grant access to the weapons. The cannon on top can move up and down too thanks to Technic parts. Another cool feature is that you can lift up the hinged front flap, push two 1x2 pieces with bars on the side, and fire out two hidden missiles! Awesome! I like to drive this speeder up to a base, say &quot;hi, no sabers, only blasters&quot;, and when the enemy tries to inspect, blast them with the missiles and speed in!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Cyborg Darth Maul, the reason I bought this set, does not disappoint. As has been previously noted in another review, Maul is too tall, but that is negligible as the moulded detailing on his legs is fabulous!</p>

<p>The Mandalorian Supercommandos are cool too, but they actually have different heads and back printing! Leg printing would have made them even closer to perfection!</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The value for money is there, as it is a sizeable set for the price. However, the amount of parts included is only 211, which could be improved by bringing it to the 250-something mark. This, however, is not a major issue, as several pieces in the set are rather large, compared to the &quot;face value&quot; set First Order Snowspeeder.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This set is&nbsp;<strong>amazing</strong>. The final product is very sleek and is incredibly fun to play with. It is swooshable too, or can be slid around on the table thanks to boat bottom plates. If you can, you should really get this set.&nbsp;</p>

"ImaginaryHighways","2022-01-16T15:29:41.143Z","Basic but Wonderful Value","<p>I was very fortunate to find this set on Ebay in perfect condition from a seller who clearly didn&#39;t understand the value of this set and was able to purchase it for &pound;30, only &pound;5 more than the original RRP. Despite having a very basic build for the speeder it is a solid one, in the words of our saviour JANG it feels very swooshable and is fun to slide around on a smooth surface thanks to the rounded plates on its underside. It has a couple of basic flick fire missiles and some clips for the weapons of the included minifigures. However, the lack of features is no issue due to the lovely amount of useable space in the speeder. It comfortably fits all the included minifigures and would easily fit more to make a great troop transporter. The open topped design makes it fun to have figures with their weapons drawn over the sides and would be nice to pose 2 next to each other with opposing forces battling it out, it&#39;s a shame a Mandalorian Loyalist variant was never released for this exact purpose. In terms of figures included the set comes with 2 beautifully detailed &#39;Maul&#39;dalorian warriors. These are exclusive to the set and very desirable for fans of the Clone Wars. They both come with jetpacks and medium blasters to complete their look. It also includes an exclusive Darth Maul with robot legs minifigure. Whilst his head print is in the awful cartoon style the early clone wars figures adopted it works somewhat better here for Maul than some of the other characters. Other than the face print it&#39;s a gorgeous figure, the torso and arm print along with the moulded robot legs make him stand out and give him. so much height over other standard minifigures. Simply swapping the head for one of the recent Maul figures makes this a fantastic addition to a Clone Wars collection. Overall this set has great value for collectors and kids alike. It&#39;s simplistic yet fun and looks accurate to the speeder in the show, and the inclusion of 3 exclusive desirable figures really seals the deal. If you can find this set for near RRP then I highly recommend it, and unless another is made I can only see this set increasing in value.</p>
