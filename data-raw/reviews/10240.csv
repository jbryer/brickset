"Huw","2013-08-04T13:58:33.59Z","Official Brickset review","<p>Earlier today at the San Diego Comic Con, the next LEGO Cuusoo model, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=21103-1"" title=""View set details"">21103</a> Back to the Future DeLorean, was unveiled. &nbsp;It became a <a href=""http://blog.lego.cuusoo.com/2012/06/04/congratulations-to-the-summer-lego-review-qua/"">review qualifier</a>&nbsp;in June 2012 and <a href=""http://blog.lego.cuusoo.com/2012/12/20/results-of-the-summer-lego-review/"">passed review</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;December. It&#39;s taken just over a year then to be turned into a retail set.&nbsp;In the interim, licenses have been acquired and legendary designer Steen Sig Andersen has turned the original submission into&nbsp;a model suitable for becoming a&nbsp;boxed LEGO set.</p>

<p>I am certain that the LEGO Cuusoo team would have liked today&#39;s unveiling to have been the first time the model was seen but unfortunately the LEGO marketing department had other ideas and <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?ID=6848"">published a photo</a>&nbsp;on the July store calendar which found its way into the public domain a few weeks ago. Thus we have&nbsp;all had an opportunity to form an opinion on this set and unfortunately much of the talk has been negative. [Note that this review was written several weeks ago before the official images emerged earlier this week.]</p>

<p>Anyway before reviewing the set, let&#39;s remind ourselves what the model submitted to Cuusoo, and the car in the movies,&nbsp;looked like...</p>

<p>It captures the essence of the vehicle well, particularly the long shallow-sloped bonnet. It&#39;s a bit crude and blocky in places, and there are a few &#39;illegal moves&#39; evident.&nbsp;It will be interesting to see then,&nbsp;(a) whether the model that made it to production improves on the original submission and (b) how much of the original model has survived.</p>

<h2>Box and contents</h2>

<p>For some reason, Cuusoo models are packaged in much higher-quality boxes than normal LEGO sets. It&#39;s about 25 x 19 cm and features a folding lid. The picture on the front is that which appeared in the store calendar.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9212252407/"" title=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2871/9212252407_882952caba.jpg"" style=""height:378px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>Interestingly, the French name of the film is printed on the side. Why not also the Spanish, German, Japanese, etc., I wonder?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9215032412/"" title=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7437/9215032412_5d69aca331.jpg"" style=""height:500px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>The back of the box reveals something that comes as a nice surprise: the model can be converted into&nbsp;three versions of the vehicle, as&nbsp;seen in all three parts of the trilogy.</p>

<p>Once the plastic tabs are cut, the lid opens cleanly to reveal the contents....</p>

<p>Five unnumbered bags of parts, a few loose plates (401 parts in total)&nbsp;and...</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9212254285/"" title=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3757/9212254285_5d28ffc0bc.jpg"" style=""height:299px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>A thick, 112-page,&nbsp;instruction manual, 20 x 12 cm. It&#39;s perfect bound and more like a book than a normal instruction booklet.&nbsp; The instructions inside are printed on a black background. One problem with the perfect binding is that it&#39;s impossible to lay it flat which is a problem when you&#39;re building the model, and also made it impossible to photograph the inside for you :-)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9212254585/"" title=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3689/9212254585_bc9db30394.jpg"" style=""height:286px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>Emptying the bags revealed no new pieces, or even pieces in new colours (as far as I could tell) but it was very pleasing to see that there are no stickers: all decorated parts are printed. Mind you, there&#39;s only four of them: the flux capacitor, the time machine control, a 1985 licence plate and a 2015 barcode licence plate, for the version of the car in the second two movies.</p>

<p>The more astute among you will notice that the time machine shows a date from 1958 and not 1955, which as far as the movies is concerned, is incorrect. January 28th, 1958 is however the date the LEGO brick was patented, which is a pretty neat touch.</p>

<p>The time machine control should show three dates but I guess that would have made them all too small and a 2 x 0.5&nbsp;tile doesn&#39;t yet exist :-)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9215034390/"" title=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5329/9215034390_ab59d9b3ef.jpg"" style=""height:398px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>It&#39;s great to see that despite initial fears when the picture appeared on the calendar sans-minifigs, the set does come with minifigure versions of Doc and Marty, and very nice they are too. Marty is wearing his sleeveless puffy-jacket from 1985 and Doc his lab coat. The legs are not printed which is a bit of a shame given that it&#39;s becoming commonplace these days.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9215034866/"" title=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5462/9215034866_948873f110.jpg"" style=""height:404px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>There&#39;s a skateboard for Marty, although for some reason the gravity-defying version from 2015 is missing from the set :-)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9212255675/"" title=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""21103 Cuusoo Back To The Future DeLorean"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2833/9212255675_3bb7859127.jpg"" style=""height:368px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>The backs of their heads are printed with a shocked expression and the backs of their torsos are printed. I don&#39;t recall the Doc having such a prominent hazard symbol on his back but it looks cool anyway.</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>Building the model is very enjoyable. Unsurprisingly, you start at the bottom of the chassis and work your way up. The front and back of the construction look very similar in the early stages&nbsp;so, very helpfully, they&#39;ve been colour coded with blue and red to avoid getting them mixed up. The way the&nbsp;wheels&nbsp;turn 90 degrees can be seen below.</p>

<p>The back manifolds&nbsp;(or whatever they are)&nbsp;look good.The time machine control attaches to the dashboard and...</p>

<p>The flux capacitor is at the rear between the seats, where it should be. Seats? What seats? There are none, unfortunately. More on that later...</p>

<p>The gull-wing doors fit perfectly although they are a bit fragile: the black 1 x 1 clip has a tendency to detach from the door when you open them.</p>

<h2>The finished model</h2>

<p>Greebling, wheels and windscreen surrounds finish off the model. This is the 1985 version.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the 2015 version with wheels folded under and the fusion reactor mounted&nbsp;at the back.&nbsp;The wheels&nbsp;do fold the full 90 degrees, but I didn&#39;t fold them enough before taking this photo.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>When I first saw the picture on the calendar I, along with many of you, was horrified. It looked terrible and nothing like the original Cuusoo submission which used the large slope piece for the bonnet to such good effect.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve built it, what do I think? Let&#39;s go through the good and bad points:</p>

<p>+ The model retains the essence of the original and&nbsp;has kept many of&nbsp;its good features, such as the rotating wheels, the &#39;wiring&#39; round the body and&nbsp;the opening gull-wing doors.</p>

<p>- The loss of the shallow slope for the bonnet is a major blow and changes the look of the car considerably. However, the design does allow for the attachment of the additional greebling for the part 3 model and when that&#39;s been fitted, the bonnet looks great.</p>

<p>+ Printed parts, no stickers.</p>

<p>+ The minifigures are superb and capture Doc and Marty perfectly. The submission had a cloth coat for the Doc&nbsp;which would have been nice but given nothing similar exists, it&#39;s unsurprising that there isn&#39;t one.</p>

<p>+ The addition of&nbsp;parts to enable the car to be converted into one of the three versions is a great touch.</p>

<p>- It&#39;s not possible to get both&nbsp;Doc and Marty inside. It&#39;s a struggle to get just one figure in. There are no seats.</p>

<p>- There&#39;s something not quite right with the windscreen surrounds and from some angles they look terrible. From the side, or the back, they look fine, but&nbsp;at a&nbsp;three-quarters angle, such as that on the calendar, or head on as seen above,&nbsp; they really don&#39;t work in my opinion. The top of the roof is just four studs wide (on the original it was six) so that doesn&#39;t help with the appearance of this area. However, I am sure that if there was a way to make it look better, Steen would have found it, and certainly&nbsp;my feeble efforts to try and&nbsp;improve it by changing the width of the roof and so on have been unsuccessful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can live with the figures not fitting and the change to the bonnet given the advantage it has, but the windscreen surround issue spoils the look of the vehicle, and thus my enjoyment of it,&nbsp;a lot. I am hopeful that&nbsp;someone out in the community will be able to find a &#39;solution&#39; to this problem, perhaps using borderline-illegal methods, or obsolete parts, that Steen couldn&#39;t.</p>

<p>That said, there is certainly more to like about the set than there is to dislike and it&#39;s bound to be highly sought after. Whether it flies off the shelves like Minecraft remains to be seen, but I think it will sell well, particularly in the USA where I believe it&#39;ll be priced at $34.99.&nbsp;In the UK it&#39;s &pound;34.99 which is still not&nbsp;too bad, I suppose.</p>

<p>Scores, out of 5:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Parts:&nbsp;3 -- A lot of useful small pieces but nothing special other than the printed tiles.</li>
	<li>Playability:&nbsp;2 -- This is not a set with much playability, particularly given the minifigs don&#39;t fit inside.</li>
	<li>Building experience:&nbsp;3 -- Straightforward. The end result is a solid,&nbsp;(well, apart from the doors...) parts-dense model.</li>
	<li>Value for money: USA: 4, rest of world: 3 -- not a bad price for 400 parts and 2 minifigs.</li>
	<li>Overall: 3 -- A reasonable model, but one that,&nbsp;aesthetically,&nbsp;could have been so much better</li>
</ul>

"tkettle9719","2013-08-11T00:34:18.197Z","Cuusoo (Back to the Future): 21103: The DeLorean Time Machine Review","<p>I first learned about Cuusoo nearly a year or two ago, when it was announced, thinking that a couple sets might entice my tastes in Lego. Boy, was I wrong. The platform is full of amazing projects, full of ideas, and so many of them are just beautiful. This was the second project I ever supported on the site (the first was the failed Star Wars Dark Bucket), so I was super happy to see this set be one of the first to pass the 10,000 vote mark. This set was just released as of writing, and I can honestly say that my vote still stands. I LOVE this set. It's beautiful, and looks great. This review might be longer, but please bear with me for it. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>I love the minifigs in here; Marty and the Doc in Lego! I never though I would say that in a million years! They look fantastic, and are among the best minifigures in my collection. If only Einstein were included...<br></li><li>The printed pieces really give this set a touch that it needs to make it unique; all four pieces are great, with one exception (a minor, almost invisible error, puts one of the printed parts down.)<br></li><li>The set contains parts to make all three versions of the DeLorean from the three films; most likely, I will keep my copy in the first film version (since that is my favorite of the trilogy) most likely, but all three versions look absolutely fantastic. <br></li><li>I love the fact that the gull wing doors open up instead of out; it's those little details that can make or break a set; even if only attached by one side instead of two, the detail is there, and it looks awesome. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>This set was made on a deadline, so I can forgive most of these mistakes, except for one: the flux capacitor says ""SHEILD EYES..."", not ""SHIELD EYES"", which is the correct spelling, as far as I am aware. Maybe Lego wanted to make sure we knew how to spell the word, or maybe the movie flux capacitor has this error, but as far as I am aware, this is a grievous error (rant done). <br></li><li>The car also is incapable of fitting more than one minifigure in the DeLorean (which I happen to love for being the focal point of the set, FYI); this is a problem, but I can forgive it since the two rarely were in the DeLorean at the same time (the only time I can recall was the end of the original and the beginning of Part II).</li><li>The car also is very fragile at the doors and a few other places; if this is a display model for you, then this doesn't really matter, but playing around with it for a while will break the doors and bits from the back side of the car. <br></li><li>There is also a tiny bit of red showing at the front of the DeLorean; it is barely noticeable, but if you look closely enough, you will notice it, and it is a bit irritating; I understand that the goal of the red plate was to distinguish the front and the back, but it really should have been covered at least a little bit. <br></li></ul><p>I never thought that I would say this, but I have a Lego DeLorean. It rocks on many levels; it is detailed, it looks very close to the original model (I think, or at least it retains the feel of it), and it just has the design that few sets ever make. Can it be fixed? Of course it can; every Lego set can. But I'm willing to forgive since this is more of a display model than one for play, and it was made on a quick time budget. It is wonderful, and I highly recommend it while you can get it; according to Lego, they're selling like hotcakes at the number one spot on top sellers, so hurry up and make your wildest 80s dream come true once and for all. <br></p><p>P.S.- I think congratulations and thanks are in order to Masashi Togami and Sakuretsu for their beautiful inspiration model- it was beautiful and I thank you for making one of my favorite movie props immortalized in the Lego brick. Also, I appreciate your contribution to the Michael J. Fox foundation. You guys are really awesome, and best of luck to your other BTTF projects. Team Back to the Future for the win!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The minifigures are what you should expect from a well done set. &nbsp;Not original pieces, but good printing on them to make them fit.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>As this set is 90% plates, the build is quite boring. &nbsp;It doesn't even start to resemble a car until 80% of the way through. &nbsp;Most of the time is taken by building up the foundation of plates. &nbsp;</p><p>The roof and doors lack anything resembling cohesion. &nbsp;The doors aren't connected to the frame of the car, and the windshield isn't connected to the roof at all.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>When completed, the first thought I had was ""This thing will never fit on my Lego City roads."" &nbsp;The current batch of City vehicles are 6 studs wide. &nbsp;This car is 10 studs wide when you include the exterior pipes and tires.</p><p>The next thought I had was ""Can I even fit a minifig inside?"" &nbsp;Turns out the answer is Yes… If you don't want to be able to close the doors.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The production time crunch really did this set a lot of injustices. &nbsp;The finished model looks more like a jeep than a sleek 80's sports car turned time machine.&nbsp;</p><p>As a display model, the set is fine, but playability suffers from the inability to put the minifigs inside it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3

"Harmonious_Building","2013-08-12T13:23:31.487Z","You built a time machine? Out of LEGO? ","I've only been a (mostly lurking) member of the AFOL community for a few years now, and if you had told me prior to that that the release of a LEGO set could result in anything even remotely approaching controversy, I would have told you to make like a tree and get outta here. My naivete has waned somewhat over the years, I suppose, but looking at the polarising comments that the DeLorean has received thus far, I have to say that I find myself surprised at how much vitriol people are capable of digging up against a couple of pieces of plastic.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>But I guess that's beside the point.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I wouldn't call myself a die-hard fan of Back to the Future; I've seen the three movies and that's really about it. But I am always interested in comparatively intricate LEGO models and the DeLorean seemed like a good place for me to jump into the CUSCOO line - it was something recognisable and iconic to me and seemed to fit more appropriately with the sprawling universe of LEGO licensed themes based on movies (as opposed to <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=21102-1"">video games</a>). And while US$35 is not exactly cheap for a set of this size, it isn't a bank-breaker as far as LEGO is concerned, so why not.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I'll say this: when you open up a CUSCOO set, you really do feel as though you're participating in something special, something that's just a little more than the usual LEGO set. It's all marketing and psychology, of course, but the high-quality box and book-like instruction manual definitely set this above your usual LEGO experience right from the start. The manual will probably appeal most to Back to the Future fans with its movie stills and all, but any experienced LEGO builder will also appreciate the design commentary listed as footnotes on some of the pages. I certainly found these details to be quite charming, so much so that they helped to defray - in my mind, anyway - the slightly weightier pricetag.</div><div><br></div><div>Marty McFly and Doc Brown are the protagonists of the trilogy and therefore their inclusion is unsurprising but very welcome. Of the two, McFly is somewhat more generic but still recognisable, while Doc's ""radioactive"" labcoat and crazy hair (which is not a new mould but certainly a very good choice) make him the standout between the two. The only other accessory you get is McFly's skateboard/hoverboard. Neither of the Minifigs is particularly impressive but of course they're likely to please anyone who has passing experience with the movies.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And now for the main event, the DeLorean itself. The official review below will give you a very detailed description of exactly what's going on, so I won't bother with restating them again when Huw (and others) have already done so with much greater competence and skill than I ever would be able to. For me personally, though, I could tell that compromises definitely had to be made and that a lot of thought went into the design process when it came to balancing aesthetics and functionality. This is not like building the usual four-wide or even six-wide car that merely has to suggest ""car-ness"" in order to be convincing and fun. Not only does this model have to reference a specific (and iconic) car, but also the trappings and adornments from the movies, too. That's a challenge.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The result is a car that is much larger than any other Minifig-scale car available from, say, the City line, and also one that is a great deal more fragile owing to the sheer number of details and movable parts that the design attempts to incorporate, and believe me when I say that you will be amazed and how many details there are. The tradeoff, then, is stability, and while the rudimentary movable parts work well in isolation, you may find that the sum total ends up being more finicky than first glances suggest.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What this means is that the DeLorean is, ultimately, a display model rather than one to play with. This doesn't mean that it necessarily remains static: you can (and should!) adjust all the various parts to get the tableau that you desire. In that regard, it's hard to complain about the model. Just be aware that should you have a child in the house who is experiencing Back to the Future for the first time and wants to actually play with it, this DeLorean's mileage may vary (and may not even make it up to 88 miles per hour without severe damage).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I personally enjoyed building this model and very much like how it looks, and I think that the DeLorean/Back to the Future is ""mainstream"" enough that it provides a good opportunity for many people to jump into CUSCOO to see what the fuss is all about. Read the reviews and see for yourself if you think it's right for you - but don't wait too long or you may be forced to do a bit of time travelling yourself to pick one up.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,1,3

"mngoult","2014-06-10T21:01:00.283Z","At least its fixable","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As has been mentioned, you can&#39;t argue with the quality of either. Lovely box with re-sealable edges and well bound instruction manual. A welcome touch throughout is information on the project and the original movie.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Actually a lovely selection of plates, tiles and other detailing parts in the usual bright colours we expect from Lego. Non-numbered bags (as is the norm with cussoo) but not too many pieces to necessarily require this anyway. I marked down 2 stars on this section for the lack of a 6x8 slope piece that we were all expecting when the original idea passed the review.</p>

<p>The spelling mistake is not obvious to me as the writing is extremely small on the printed piece anyway. Some excellent printed tiles complete a reasonable selection of parts for &pound;35.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Marty is superb, excellent choice of hair, clothes and facial expression. Doc is acepteble but again i was hoping for some sort of over-coat. Einstein is missing but it would be hard to include a unique dog and justify the additional costs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I wanted to enjoy it but deep down i knew the minute it was finished i would rebuilt it with the afore mentioned slope. This meant i was essentially using this set (as i suspect many others will) as an opportunity to aquire the 2 figures and a good starting point for my own changes.</p>

<p>Instructions are clear and accurate as we would expect and the built time is around the hour mark.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>In my view i think lego sacrificed too much for the final version, i was horrified when the first pictures appeared and no less horrified with the actual built model. It is blocky, ungainly and for a car 10 studs wide not capable of sitting a single figure inside. It does have acertain vroom factor and the doors are a nice creation, as are the turnable wheels.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Too many &#39;comprimises&#39; made in the final design, i was delighted about the ability to switch between 3 deloreans but just wanted it to look like a delorean once. It is very straight forwards to modify it and has given me endless nights of building and rebuilding (photos below as soon as i figure out how? update poor quality but i think there added) during which time you come to realise the reasons for certain pieces and why it turned out the way it did.</p>

<p>I recommend this set as an excellent opportunity to own Marty and Doc and a starting point for your own unique delorean. As a final product i have to mark it down but that should not stop you from buying and enjoying it.</p>

The DeLorean Time Machine was one of the last to be released under the original banner of Cuusoo, it would change to Ideas shortly after the release. However this set really shows us the potential of Ideas as it is now and we&rsquo;ll discuss the set in great detail in the following sections.</span></span></span></span></p>

They also include boxes of a sort we haven&rsquo;t seen in LEGO for quite a long time, I believe some of the oldest sets in the early 80&rsquo;s included a box design with flip-open lid. This box is superbly designed. You have some brilliant effects work with a shot of the famous clock from the clocktower that served as central to the plot of the original film. The set is showcased as being in the middle of traveling through time.</span></span></span></span></p>

Where the front shows the design primarily from the perspective of the hovering BttF II model, the back shows that the model in this set can be configured between the DeLorean seen in Back to the Future, Part II or Part III. It also includes close-up shots of the printed elements of the Time Circuits, the 1985 License Plate, the 2015 License Plate and the Flux Capacitor.

His hair piece is unfortunately inaccurate, as this was a Cuusoo set (now ideas) no new sculpts were made and so he&rsquo;s left with the 2012 Joker hair piece in white.

Another issue with the model is that you can only fit one Minifigure in at a time, it isn&rsquo;t capable of seating both characters. The doors tend to have issues, the design really captured the look and function of gullwing doors, however they can be quite finicky to situate properly and tend to like falling off far too easily when opening and closing.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a very nice addition, a minor cosmetic change is to swap out the wheel wells with red hubcaps to show the new tires that 1955 Doc needed to replace the badly deteriorated versions so that it could be driven.</span></span></span></span></p>

You can make it resemble the original, the sequels or mix and match to make your own weird version. Both Minifigures are great, the one flaw is that you can&rsquo;t seat both of them in the car at once. As a display piece it&rsquo;s great, as a buildable toy it works quite well, although I am beginning to see where it can have a few frustrating bits because every time you pick it up one of the hoses on the side is destined to pop off the stud holding it.</span></span></span></span></p>

"AdeelZubair","2016-06-25T13:47:20.777Z","You Built A Time Machine...Out Of LEGO?","<p><strong>First Impressions</strong><br />
This set was first seen on the July Lego Store Calendar and when I saw this the first time I was impressed with this set, however most people disliked it from the first glance. This is a must have set for every Back to the Future fan. This is an impressive recreation of the DeLorean from the popular 1980&#39;s movie: Back to the Future. I think this will be an iconic and popular LEGO set, as it even makes a quick demand on the first day of release much like the Lego Minecraft Micro World #21102.</p>

<p><strong>Unique Parts</strong><br />
This set contains four unique printed pieces: Time settings Display is a Medium Stone Grey Flat Tile 1X2. In this model, the &ldquo;Target Date&rdquo; is &ldquo;01.28.1958&rdquo;, the date that the first Lego brick was patented (which is a neat touch for Lego fans) and 10.26 1985 as the Present Time. It doesn&#39;t&nbsp;have Last Time Departed as the numbers will be very small and hard to read but does capture the main reason for the Time Settings Display in the DeLorean. 2015 License Plate is a Bright Orange Flat Tile 1X2. Is the license plate that is featured in Back to the Future, Part II. 1985 License Plate is a White Flat Tile 1X2. Is the license plate that is featured in Back to the Future, Part I Flux Capacitor is a Medium Stone Grey Wallelement 1X2X2, it is the core component of the DeLorean Time Machine that is what makes time travel happen. It has spelling error, Shield is spelled &ldquo;Sheild&rdquo; which is the main negative with the set and hopefully Lego corrects this error. The front should have a new &ldquo;Roof Tile 1X2X2/3, Abs&rdquo; and had DMC printed on it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
This set contains two exclusive minifigures Doc Brown and Marty McFly. Doc Brown is wearing his lab coat with white trousers and has 3 exclusive pieces. Marty McFly is wearing is gilet and blue trousers and he has 2 exclusive pieces with one very rare pair of Medium Blue trousers. Marty McFly has a purple skateboard and could have come with a &ldquo;Hover Board&rdquo; as well.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
This set is not really made to play as it only has two gull-wing doors just like the real car, it has space for one minifigure which is a shame however it looks like the minifigures were a final addition to the set and foldable wheels as featured in Back to the Future, Part II as extra transparent bricks to give it the flying effect. This set has a bonus feature that you can customise the DeLorean to suit one from the three movies but not a huge difference as it comes with two licence plates, Mr. Fusion Home Energy Reactor, Four red wheels (not including the tires) and a rack of vacuum tubes and other components on the hood for the Back to the Future, Part III Delorean.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong><br />
This set contains 5 five unnumbered bags with three plates. The instruction booklet is thick and is a high-quality book containing the building instructions, information on Lego Cuusoo and Back to the Future similar to the Lego Architecture series. As your building facts appear on some pages which is very neat. The build is simply starts staking plates on top of each other and a few technic elements for the rotating wheels. The build follows with a colour coded base of the DeLorean: Red for the front and blue for the front as the early stages are symmetrical. It&rsquo;s an enjoyable build with very small pieces used for details. The doors did not fall off for me as I was placing the on to the DeLorean, for some others the doors fell off. The DeLorean has a variety of different building techniques is any very enjoyable build for the size of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong><br />
This retails for &pound;34.99 in the UK and contains 401 pieces. Is a fairly small build for a &pound;34.99 set because it uses small pieces to capture details on the DeLorean. Back to the Future fans will really appreciate this model, however people who are not familiar may not be drawn to this set other than it is a unique type of vehicle from Lego and delivers a different build experience.</p>

<p><strong>Theme Popularity</strong><br />
Lego Cuusoo products are mixture of different models chosen by the fans. This set is based on the &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo; trilogy which is very popular in the 1980&#39;s and adults will be drawn to this set as a collector&rsquo;s item.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusivity</strong><br />
This set is available at Lego Stores and http://shop.lego.com/ and other selected retailers. It is also stated on the Lego Cuusoo website, that these sets are limited to 10,000; however the Lego Minecraft Micro World (21102) was so popular Lego made more quantities.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong><br />
The packaging is worth keeping as is very similar to the Lego Architecture boxes, using the high-quality box with an opening lid to keep your contents safe after building the model.</p>

<p>Growth Potential:<br />
This will do very well as an investment potential in 2015 as it is the 30th Anniversary of Back to the Future trilogy. Lego Cuusoo sets do very well as investments as they are limited and unique for a short period of time, much like the Lego Minecraft Micro World #21102.</p>

<p><strong>Display Attributes</strong><br />
Yes, this It is a great collector&rsquo;s item and display piece however people were hoping for a larger scale of the DeLorean from Lego but we should appreciate what we have. The windshield and hood of the &ldquo;DeLorean&rdquo; is not really accurate but is suitable for the scale of this vehicle as Lego normally uses windshield pieces which would not be suitable for this set. This does look like a &ldquo;DeLorean&rdquo; but not as much at the front.</p>

<p><strong>Final Analysis/ Conclusion</strong><br />
Overall this set it is a must have set for every Back to the Future fan. If you&rsquo;re a Lego collector of cars this will also be a unique and it will stand out from other Lego cars of this scale. This set has four unique printed pieces and two exclusive Minifigures: Doc Brown and Marty McFly. It could have had a &ldquo;Hover Board&rdquo; and the Flux Capacitor doesn&#39;t please many people when &ldquo;Shield&rdquo; is spelt wrong. Is it worth the money: for &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo; fans is a must buy. This set is limited so get you hands on it when you can.</p>

"Cold_fuzion","2014-07-09T14:15:30.543Z","Great Scott, Marty! I should have put more time into this time machine!","<p>This is my first cusoo/ideas set and it&#39;s based on one of my favorite movies from the 80s. How could combining my newfound love of LEGO with my less-new love of Back to the Future possibly go wrong? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is nice even if mine did ship from the vendor with a giant sticker on the front. Grumble grumble. Anyway it&#39;s a nice re-usable box similar to the Architecture line. But, it&#39;s a box and not what I&#39;m here for anyway.</p>

<p>The instructions are a really nice perfect bound book loaded with a lot of info about the movie and little bits of trivia and stuff sprinkled throughout. The issue I can see if the binding is kind of inadequate and I can easily see it falling apart in time.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No stickers! There are some nice printed plates (including a Flux capacitor with a typo) and nary a sticker to be seen. So this set wins big points for that as I hate stickers. There&#39;s also a couple neat Technic bits and red tire rims (which I have not seen before). Otherwise there are a lot of small grey and black bits that you probably already have a lot of.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs are great. It amazes me how the LEGO people can make a blocky little plastic dude with just a little bit of printing feel like &quot;this is Marty McFly.&quot; If you&#39;re a fan of the movies these guys are probably worth the cost of the set alone.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is the most disappointing&nbsp;LEGO build I&#39;ve had so far. I knew going into it the I wasn&#39;t going to be thrilled with the final product (I&#39;ll get into that later), but the build itself was a bit tedious and completely unsatisfying. There is a lot of stacking little plates on top of each other which would be something I would do to avoid a blocky end product, but that is not at all what&#39;s being done here. There are also far too many&nbsp;single-stud connections (or no studs at all) that make some parts of the build nerve-wracking as the model wants to fall apart the more you add instead of getting sturdier. Expect about an hour to two to complete this depending on your ability (and whether or not you&#39;re also watching Doctor Who at the same time).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Blocky, ugly and flimsy as heck. While there are some really neat aspects to this model, they are overshadowed by the weirdly blocky shape and don&#39;t-blink-too-hard-or-you&#39;ll-break-it end result. There are way too many single-stud connections. The doors and roof are a mess of clips and just lean these two parts together and hope for the best connections. The minfigs don&#39;t actually fit in the car which is, quite honestly, mind-boggling. This was not meant to be played with nor is it particularly cool-looking, so I&#39;m not sure what the goal was with this model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>By all rights I should love this set, but I don&#39;t. Instead I finished this and immediately began searching for mods to make it look better (there are a few really good ones, btw). I can see this being something I mod into a cool display piece, but I&#39;m a little irked that I need to do that. Some of the details are great and there are some pretty clever build techniques here, but they are just overshadowed by a flimsy and ultimately kind of ugly final product.</p>

"Dalekbuster523","2014-02-27T19:58:18.67Z","You built a time machine...out of a Delorean...out of LEGO?","<p>LEGO and the Back to the Future&#39;s Delorean is such a perfect fit that it&#39;s a wonder it&#39;s not been done before. Ever wanted to build a time traveling Delorean? Well now you can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The instructions are simple to follow and the pictures explain how to build the set nicely. The box has to be the best one I&#39;ve ever seen a LEGO set come in. It&#39;s lid really adds to the presentation and makes storage for the LEGO parts easier.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts allow for a enjoyable build, however some pieces are too similar to others and that can make the instructions slightly confusing. It&#39;s not a major problem,though. I&#39;d say it&#39;s only a minor niggle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Great scott do the minifigures look like Doc Brown and Marty McFly. They bear a huge resemblance to the characters and are therefore definitely my favourite part of the set. It&#39;s a shame that LEGO Marty McFly&nbsp;comes with a normal skateboard and not the hover board from Back to the Future part 2 but the skateboard suits Marty&#39;s character well anyway.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was a very enjoyable build of which never grew dull but embarrassingly, it took me quite a long time to complete. I doubt it took as long as two days for anyone else!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks fantastic. It really does captures the look of the Delorean nicely. Fitting the minifigures in is difficult, however there is a way of doing it without modifying the set. I&#39;d recommend anyone who buys this set to put it in a display cabinet as I would say it is more of a collectible model as opposed to a toy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>+The minifigures bear a strong resemblance to Doc Brown and Marty McFly.</p>

<p>+ The set captures the look of the Delorean perfectly.</p>

<p>+Enjoyable build.</p>

<p>+Instructions are easy to follow.</p>

<p>+Fantastic packaging.</p>

<p>-Some pieces look too similar to others included in the set.</p>

<p>-Marty McFly&nbsp;should have a hover board.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>- Pretty good, they need to make the instruction booklet better quality, over time the pages will fall out.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good parts in this set but mine was missing a piece which is rare in my experience with Lego</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Good detail, the skateboard should have been a hoverboard</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took longer to build than expected, but fun!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Pretty decent, should have gone with at least some kind of windshield on the car, love the flux capacitor!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Get this for the collector value, its not expensive tho could have been even better.</p>

","<p>Firstly, I love Lego and Back to the Future so when this was announced I was champing at the bit to get it and any fan should get it as it&#39;s a collector&#39;s piece.&nbsp; The little touches and the figures are well worth it, and it&#39;s price on release was very good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the build, but I&#39;m just a little....... disappointed with the finished look. It just looks a little..... unfinished.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s still on display though, after all it is BTTF and Lego.&nbsp;</p>
