"skinnylawyer","2013-02-19T02:25:03.047Z","Not the best Modular Building I've seen, but still a great set","<p>Palace Cinema was released on Valentine's Day 2013 in the US, exclusively for Lego VIP members, and I decided to pick one up for myself at my nearest Lego Store that very evening. This is the second Modular Building released since I came out of the Dark Ages at the end of 2011, and the first one that I decided to buy immediately on the launch day. For the general public, the set is available from 1 March.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box looks different from previous Modular Building boxes, since Palace Cinema is the first Modular Building marketed under Lego's new ""Creator Expert"" line, which is the all-encompassing category for all grownup-grade collectible sets from 2013 on. The box is also much shallower than that for the Town Hall set, though it makes sense due to this set having 600 fewer pieces. The inside of the box is fairly full.</p><p>The instructions are supplied on three booklets. The first booklet now has even a section on how to use the Brick Separator; a green one is supplied with this set (if I am not mistaken, first time that a non-orange Brick Separator is being offered in the US). The first booklet covers the ground floor which includes the concession stand and the box office, the second booklet covers the cinema and its seats, and the third booklet covers the faux-Oriental roof and the marquee sign.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>In terms of color, nice variety. Not much in the way of whites and grays, which used to dominate many sets I had built recently. The bright red and scarlet used for the faux-Oriental roof tiles are quite awesome, and due to their quantity, could easily be used in a future MOC. Other interesting colors too, including baby blue for the marquee sign.</p><p>I like the printed 2x2 studless tiles that have the ""Brick Walk of Fame"" insignia on them.</p><p>In terms of variety, I wasn't as sure, as the parts seem to be rather run-of-the-mill for the most part. Also while the parts count is 2196 pieces which is consistent with other Modular Buildings, many of the parts are of the small variety (1x1, 1x2, etc) which make the building process a bit tedious at times.</p><p>Decals are used for three front-and-back movie posters, for the marquee sign, and for the movie screen itself. I especially like the movie titles - <i>The Brick Separator</i>&nbsp;as a horror movie where the green Brick Separator becomes a monster destroying Lego buildings, <i>Mystery on the Monorail </i>as a shout-out to late 1980s Lego Space Monorail, <i>Forever Sorting</i>&nbsp;as a romantic feature (and what I found myself doing as I built this set),&nbsp;and the feature film of the evening, <i>Three Clicks and a Snap</i>, featuring Minnie Figure in the starring role.</p><p>This set being about the Hollywood glamour, the base plate is in red, to befit the red carpet event that would be a movie premiere.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Palace Cinema comes with six minifigures, all featuring the classic smiley as is the case with Modular Buildings minifigures:</p><p></p><ul><li>Minnie Figure: As this set seems to go for the glamour of Golden Age of Hollywood, the star is a young girl along the lines of, say, Shirley Temple or Judy Garland. She looks the way a child star should - rather simple but elegant look, with tied-back brown hair, purple floral top, and purple pants. I was honestly thinking: ""Lindsay Lohan in her <i>The Parent Trap</i>&nbsp;days, before her current meltdown.""</li><li>Chauffeur: Dressed in a nice black uniform, he is the trusty driver who drives Minnie Figure's stylish black open-top limousine.</li><li>Male moviegoer: With slicked blond hair and black tuxedo, he seems more like the co-star of the feature film than a guest that he is described as. I am not sure what to do with him.</li><li>Female moviegoer: Except for using a bright red lower body, she is exactly the same minifigure as the one used in Modular Building Set 10211 Pet Shop. I was disappointed here - I would've preferred a different, newer minifigure design.</li><li>Cameraman: He looks quite decent thanks to his cowboy hat and appropriate costume.</li><li>Cinema staff: Blue cap and blue striped shirt are a nice touch. He could work the concession stands then operate the projector once showtime comes.</li></ul><p></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>While the build of this set is every bit as interesting and engaging as any other Modular Building, I wasn't as happy building it as with other Modulars in my collection.</p><p>For example, many Modular Buildings come with nice mini-builds of certain key features, such as the escalators of Grand Emporium or even the toilet of Pet Shop. This one seems to have only one such nice mini-build, namely the movie projector, and even then it is not as imaginative as, say, the refrigerator of Fire Brigade. While the reclining seats of the cinema are also a nice mini-build, they are not all that imaginative honestly.</p><p>I liked building the stairs that lead to the next level up. In particular, the building of the ground floor walls with special L-shaped pieces, to set up the landings for the spiral steps, was quite ingenious.</p><p>Another interesting build is the roof, particularly the red tiles. Lots of 1x1 cylinders in scarlet and bright red are used, to build at 13x4 grid, and they are suspended using rods and SNOT technique. They look quite awesome. On the other hand, the steep pointed gable feels unfinished.</p><p>I loved building the ""PALACE"" sign, but didn't like the way it had a bit of trouble holding together, nor the way it integrated into the rest of the building. All in all, when I finished building this set, it still felt a bit unfinished, and I simply did not feel the same kind of satisfaction I had felt with my previous Modular Buildings.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>While I didn't enjoy the build as much as I had hoped, it is still a gorgeous model, and works well with my other Modular Buildings. The sidewalk tile patterns, thanks to the Walk of Fame, are different from previous Modular Buildings, yet the dimensions are the same and they flow with the others as they should. The box office, the concession stand, the cinema itself, and even the roof (where lovers could go make out, as suggested by one of the box photos), do offer lots of play possibilities. There even are floodlights and ropes for that red carpet premiere event.</p><p>This model does have only two floors plus the roof, so in terms of usable floor space, it has less than other Modular Buildings, which normally have three floors. The corner design of the building further cuts down on floor space, a problem shared by the Grand Emporium. Additionally, I wish that there was room for an extra row of seats at least for the cinema, so that I could bring in tons of other minifigures from other Modular Building sets.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As far as Modular Buildings go, this is a bit of a miss. Some elements feel unfinished, the build process is not as memorable as I'd like, and this is clearly not one of the best Modular Buildings. Nevertheless, it still is a Modular Building, and still is a great set, and I am glad that I got to buy and build it pretty much right away.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

I know a great little old theater...</span></b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">Being a big
fan of the Modular building series since the Greengrocer I was very anxious what
the Palace would be like. I must say it is quite a beaty again!Nice job Astrid &amp; Jordan.<br></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">The build
from the floor up was a good 2 evenings work (including sorting out the parts,
becease that's how I like to work it) which over all was great fun. Nothing to
difficult or fancy. And actually there are a few design features that are
worth looking at.</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:
normal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">The baseplate</span></i></b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">As
mentioned in the video-preview from LEGO the baseplate is red which is new and
gives the floor in the Palace a real ""grand cinema"" look. The printed
""Walk of Fame"" 2x2 tiles ad to that nicely! And I must ad LEGO was
not scarce on those ;-) The minifigs enter through a very nicely brickbuilt
door. I like that element because it gives this building extra grandeur (just
like with the Town Hall). Inside we get the ticketcounter and the bar. Nicely
done with a few furniture peaces and a few bottles. Just a little question of
detail: why is the candy under the glass bell the same colour as the ones in
the cubourd? Well, no real problem; I got spares, so took the liberty of putting
some other candy in place! Nice 3 lights on the back wall, so nobody will be
unnoticed at the premiere! Just 2 suggetions I permit myself; 1 Why not have
one ticketcounter reversed to the inside instead of them both outwards? <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>Would have been even more realistic and
Created more playabilty inside. 2 In the corner or against the backwall<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>under the lights I would have placed either a
toilet (no one wants to have to pee during the movie now, does he/she?) or a
wardrobe. Again; even more playabilty. In all a fine entrance to the theater and
the looks, design and combination of colors of the facade look great.</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">We take the
staircase up to the 1 floor (nice curved turn btw) and enter the actual
screening hall. It is big! That alows good acces which enhances playabilty. But
personally I think 6 seats is a little to small a screen to get a businesscase
going here!? Why not make the staircase two studs less wide and you got at
least room for 2 extra seats here. And while were at it, we can a least add an
extra row of seats at the back!? (we do not need that brown 1x2 brick there in
the corner near the window!? Or is it an airco?). In all that would make 12
seats; now we're talking a Cinema! Compliments on the projector!! great job,
very nice detail. But where are the speakers in the room? Or is the a
silentmovie theater? And one other peace of critique; what's with all the
windows? So much daylight in a cinema?, that needs curtains in front of the
windows! Well an other opportunity for pimping ;-) What u notice with the first
floor added is the 4 lights on the outsidewall; the realy set the palace out at
night: Great promotion feature there. </span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:
normal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">The roof <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></span></i></b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">We proceed
up the stairs to the roof. Personally I think that does not really add very
much. I know all the Modulars but Grand Emporium have some kind of roof access
but in this case I wonder why? Like I mentioned the 1st floor could have gotten
more seats so the staircase could have been skipped!? The design of the roof is
Excellent though. Great looks and it really gives the Palace the classic look
from the old days of cinema. The combination of colors and the spiked details are a great
designjob. The golden sun at the top of the ""Palace-sign"" tops it of!
That sign btw is Realy cool; great and ingenious <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>use of bricks. Just a bit hard to build because
the construction tends to curve to one side. Switching some gray plates helps
bending it back. <span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">In all,
although it has some features that can be upgraded I must admit this is a very
nice addition to the street I'm building. Playability is not my style but for
those who are in to that, there is space and stuff (the 2 big searchlights and the 2
bars for queing for instance) enough inside, so have yourself a nice night out
at the theater... Of corse we get 6 minifigs and a very nice car with the
palace so even more fun ;-)</span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal""><i style=""mso-bidi-font-style:
normal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">By the way!</span></i></b></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""mso-ansi-language:EN-US"" lang=""EN-US"">Just so you
know; this cinema could actually be real! Look at this clip from ""When Star Wars ruled the World"" part 3, on Youtube at 12
seconds in to this clip: <b style=""mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUa96zcwUU4</b>
<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span>I swear you can see our Palace Cinema!?
So for all of u LEGO and Star Wars fans here is your chance to have your own
Premiere Revival!</span></p>

"Duq","2016-08-01T00:18:30.877Z","The black sheep of the family","<p>I&#39;m a bit late to this party I guess as this set has been out for 3 years. I didn&#39;t like what I saw in the pictures when it was released so I wasn&#39;t going to buy it at full price. I recently got a chance to get at a good discount so I finally bought it. I started building with fairly low expectations, hoping to be surprised.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A very big box that&#39;s only about 60% full of parts. Strangely the picture on the front of the box is cropped so the top of the roof is missing. <!--StartFragment-->The instruction books (one for each floor as is the norm with the Modulars) were in a plastic bag but still bent a little; maybe a cardboard backer would have helped. <!--EndFragment--></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One part stands out in this set: the red baseplate that&#39;s unique to this set. After that there&#39;s a good pile of parts for a classic building; lots of 1xN bricks in dark tan, some arches, grille bricks in tan and brown windows.</p>

<p>Other interesting parts are the 3x3 dishes in flat silver and clear, 8 printed tiles with stars for the &#39;Walk of fame&#39;, black skeleton legs, light grey &#39;brick&#39; bricks,&nbsp; and lots of golden cheese slopes and jumpers.</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a pretty good parts pack and the main reason I purchased the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 6 minifigs in the set and as you&#39;d expect from a Creator set they&#39;re not special. I won&#39;t describe them in detail, just click the minifigs link on this page.</p>

<p>The child star is a nice idea but it means she&#39;s standing in the limo as kids legs don&#39;t bend so maybe not the best choice. The worst of the bunch is the poor guy who runs the cinema on his own. He wears the same cap as the driver only in blue. I think hair or maybe the butcher&#39;s cap would have looked better. His torso isn&#39;t great either; printing white on blue doesn&#39;t really work and results in a bluish grey rather than proper white.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As usual with modular buildings you build one floor at a time, with numbered bags and a book for each floor. Building the cinema is fairly straightforward with few interesting techniques being used. The diagonal section on the corner is neatly done with the first floor window held by a single stud. On the roof turntables are used to get the angle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there&#39;s a lot of repetition in this build. The two back walls are almost entirely plain and building them is just layer after layer of the same bricks. The windows and colums on the first floor are the same on both sides as is the roof that&#39;s made of 80 1x1 rounds.</p>

<p>The big Palace sign is quite clever, both in the shape of the letters and the way it&#39;s attached, and is one of the highlights of the model for me.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>From the outside it&#39;s a striking model. The unusual shape of the corner section is inspired by the Chinese Theater in Hollywood and you can&#39;t miss that large Palace sign. The effect of the round bricks in the roof, while a bit tedious to build, is great. The classic signs with the movie name leave you in no doubt that Palace is indeed a cinema.</p>

<p>Unfortunately that&#39;s where the good news ends. Apart from the corner piece there is not a lot of architectural detail in the facades although the harpoons used for the spotlights are a nice touch. With the crowd barriers, large spotlights and limousine the setting is for a special event, so where&#39;s that red carpet?</p>

<p>Inside the whole building feels empty. The lobby has a ticket counter and a bar but no seating. The walls are bare; there are no movie posters other than the ones in the front windows. Things get worse when you go up the narrow stairs to the actual cinema...</p>

<p>For a start there are lots of windows. Kinda strange for a cinema where you need it to be dark. The projector is mounted on a big table instead of in a projection room. Even in the smallest cinema you want the projector inside a sound-proofed room because those things are LOUD. The seats are a nice design and look comfy but they&#39;re not staggered nor stepped up towards the back. And there really should have been at least a third row. The screen itself is kinda small and partly obscured by red curtains.</p>

<p>Onto the roof. The seems to be a building regulation in Modular City that requires roof access otherwise I see no reason why you would waste parts on stairs and a doorway onto the roof. Nevermind those stairs being in the screening room. The roof is obviously just an architectural element; that tower section doesn&#39;t really have a function. That&#39;s no excuse though for leaving the back completely exposed, showing hinges in plates in various colours.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s that car. In the pictures I thought it looked hideous. After building it I can assure you that it&#39;s just as awful in the brick. The wheels are too small or the arches too big. The back is not too bad but the front is too tall and completely out of proportion with the back.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve read this far you&#39;ll have realised that I don&#39;t really like this set. As a cinema it fails on the basics. It&#39;s like having a police station where the cells have no doors. For a set in the Creator Expert Modular Buildings series it lacks refinement, details and interesting building techniques.</p>

<p>This is one of the weakest designs in the series and Lego must have realised this; it was followed by the best sofar: the Parisian Restaurant.</p>

<p>Still, as a parts pack it&#39;s good value for money.</p>

"Nesquik","2013-02-20T15:11:34.627Z","The Grand Emporium now looks a little less Grand...","A favourite LEGO drama of mine is the reaction to a newly released Modular Building. ""It looks nothing like the one near where I live!""... ""It's too small!""... ""It's too big!""... ""Why do the minifigures still have strange smiley faces?""<div><br></div><div>Yes - the latter <i>really</i> has been quoted on occasion.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The irony this time round was that the drama could well be projected in a brand new LEGO cinema, which is possibly one of the most original and exclusive concepts to have left the Billund offices in many, many years. I should point out that I too was a little apprehensive after seeing the initial promotional images, but as is becoming ever more frequent, the artwork has been processed to such a degree that it doesn't accurately reflect the final look of the product.</div><div><br></div><div>What's more, despite the lovely box, I'm completely bowled over by how much better the product looks in the flesh.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Brick-Value for Money</b></div><div><i>Palace Cinema </i>sits nicely alongside the <i>Pet Shop </i>at £119.99, but contains almost two-hundred more elements. This is great bang-for-buck when you also consider just how many more hard to find or exclusive elements are present in comparison to the <i>Pet Shop</i>, or the slightly more expensive <i>Grand Emporium. </i>With the <i>Fire Brigade </i>departing us around June time, the <i>Palace Cinema </i>may end up being one of, if not <i>the </i>best value Modular Building on the market at present.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures</b></div><div>In terms of exclusivity, there's not a lot happening in this territory with <i>Palace Cinema</i>. I'm not going to complain as Modular Buildings have rarely veered from this strategy, and is also helps to keep the product costing down too. Afterall, what 'new' or unique printed torsos could you honestly design that would be different enough from the current inventory?</div><div><br></div><div>The lady from the <i>Pet Shop </i>has obviously taken a trip here as she's present again as a casual viewer (or maybe the mother of the young actress?). I'm going to argue this was done purposefully by the designers in order to link the buildings thematically; there's no other reason she would be here. The projectionist also features a <i>Spongebob </i>torso, though I'm very glad to see the rare beige reporters hat and, of course, our rich chap with his nicely breasted and pocket-watched torso. He's handing out 100-notes like they're going out of fashion! Lucky for some...</div><div><br></div><div>In the final line-up, we do have of course the child actress, chauffeur in black suit and cap, projectionist/usher/general cinema worker (working on his own, too!), photographer/press reporter and finally, the male and female guests. It's definitely the best minifigure offering since the <i>Green Grocer.</i></div><div><br></div><div><b>That car...</b></div><div>OK, is the vehicle <i>really </i>as bad as others have made out (bearing in mind that non-owners assessments are made from internet images)? Absolutely not. But again, my reaction to this small build is based upon my own nostalgia of <i>ye olde LEGO,</i>&nbsp;and also,&nbsp;it being a part of a <i>Creator</i> product.&nbsp;This warrants a different set of expectations than if it was, say, a <i>City </i>vehicle, in which playability would be the main focus and objective. The model in question is based on an old American Buick, and <b>absolutely&nbsp;not </b>a limousine as others have simply presumed. There is a lot of attention to detail that can't be made out in promotional images (as the black components blend in with any shadows), and this renders the car a nice static addition to the cinema with some creative building techniques. It is built from an interesting choice of bricks and has the fragility of the <i>Fire Brigade's </i>truck, but this doesn't bother me as the design is the primary goal, so it is merely meant to compliment the entire scene and is not the product's USP.</div><div><br></div><div>Could TLG have improved it in any way? There's a slight possibility, but this would only go against certain limiting factors that designers face in <i>Creator,&nbsp;</i>such as a target pricing, component selection and more. I personally don't have any problems with it, and believe the cinema would be much worser off without it in terms of the narrative and final look.</div><div><br></div><div><b>... and the rest of the build</b></div><div>I was able to view this product before its release, but I never expected the build to be as enjoyable as it was. The main factor in this is that it rarely felt repetitive, and this is a considerable advantage if you've owned Modular Buildings before, or are not sure which to purchase. As much as I admire the <i>Fire Brigade </i>for example, the walls at times seemed to over-shadow many of the excellent micro-builds, and in the end I was quite glad to finish it. With buildings like <i>Pet Shop </i>and this <i>Palace Cinema, </i>however, you are constantly introduced to different and engaging build techniques.</div><div><br></div><div>Another aspect of the build that I enjoyed was how much the use of colour contributes to the final <i>look </i>of the model. The clear distinctions between wall elements/supports and interior decoration made hunting a particular part easy enough and entertaining at the same time. I was thrilled when I got to the confectionary area on the Ground Floor as it makes use of that gorgeous blue dye, and it clearly marks an Art Deco sensibility.</div><div><br></div><div>The challenge element of this build was roughly on par with the Modular Buildings that have preceded it, with exception to the more fiddly and compact&nbsp;<i>Pet Shop</i>. If anything, I would go as far as to say that it was a touch easier, but it was no less enjoyable for it. The only stage at which I advise caution is the roofing, because the cylindrical elements come in both red and brown varieties, so it's easy to lose your concentration when studying the picture of it in the manual. Also, the spire requires some patience and a steady hand when fixing the upside-down slopes to the building.</div><div><br></div><div><b>""Going to the flicks""</b></div><div>Have you ever wonder where the phrase comes from? Technicalities aside, motion pictures were originally photographed with far less calibrated pieces of equipment than in later years. During a shoot,&nbsp;each exposure (the picture taken on film) would have a small difference in its brightness level than those which preceded or succeeded it,&nbsp;and this caused the 'flicker' effect that we commonly associate with old movies. Pretty interesting, no?</div><div><br></div><div>I bring this up as the <i>Palace Cinema </i>is clearly a hybrid of function and styles from different eras; the reason from a design sense being that it incorporates as many different things as we can associate with. This ethos is true of all the Modular Buildings so far - they are not technically accurate, but are cute in their cultural references</div><div><br></div><div><i>Palace Cinema </i>does a marvellous job of this, because while not strict to <i>a </i>particular point in time, it culminates many different references to why cinemas are such magical and engaging places. The reader may decide for themselves whether this is a good or bad thing, but I believe the designers have made the right choice as it makes the product exciting. 'Legoland' is not bound to particular rules that we take for granted in real life, afterall...</div><div><br></div><div>The colour scheme, for example, is an immediate take on late ninety-twenties Art Deco styling (Quite appropriately for <i>Creator</i>, they also sourced the components from <i>Ninjago </i>and<i> Friends</i>!), featuring golds, browns and light blues for a uniform. Yet the in the screening room, the projectionist doesn't have his own room is a part of a very small audience, which is a contrast as this set-up precedes sound-films. Likewise, the 'Hollywood Stars' on the sidewalk are fashionable to the ninety-fifties and beyond.</div><div><br></div><div>There should be little disappointment that the Ground Floor 'lobby' is so vast when compared to the First Floor screening room, because as a product, it has to be sensible. Within the space limitations of the corner building, the designers have introduced a wide variety of recognisable features - seen in their prime or significance - and not sacrificed this for quantity.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A good example is of course the screening itself; it has <i>only </i>six seats. <i>""If more space was made, why not have twelve seats?"" </i>The answer to this question is rhetorical - <i>""If more space was made, why not have eighteen seats instead of twelve?""</i>... <i>""If more space was made...""</i>&nbsp;and so it continues.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It doesn't make any difference how many seats there are, because the point is that this doesn't alter the feature being demonstrated. The minifigures are watching a movie, and they're doing it in a communal sensibility that has been lost in modern multiplexes.</div><div><br></div><div>Whichever way you view <i>Palace Cinema </i>however, it is a rich mix of styles and certainly open to modification. If we have learnt one thing from the Modular Buildings, however, it is that the interior always comes second to the architecture, since the latter will always be exposed.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Parts, Stickers and Compromises&nbsp;</b></div><div>There will always be a temptation to say <i>""Should'a.... Could'a....""</i>, but there is honestly little room for improvement as a product. My only gripes are; Why didn't they include a classic red Coca-Cola style fridge in the lobby? Where is the toilet cubicle/powder room? And why didn't they include 2x1 plate elements that look like movie tickets? These are only nit-picking, but the latter seemed a little more obvious to me.</div><div><br></div><div>The immediate thing that hits you is just how many desirable elements there are in this product; including gold bricks and transparent studs. <i>Wow. </i>I've never owned a Lego model with so much gold in it, and placing this elements on the 'Palace' signage was an absolute thrill. They just look stunning.</div><div><br></div><div>With this particular design, we also see a number of more risky build techniques. The ground floor plant that sits in the corner (next to the staircase) is very unstable, because nothing is supporting it around the base. Also, the large 'corner' window panes on the First Floor are actually a micro build and slide between the two sides of the building in very clever fashion, but is also very loose even when a plate is applied above it. The spire is also quite unusual and is faltered with a bit of instability.</div><div><br></div><div>We then come to the most surprising inclusion... Stickers in a <i>Creator </i>product? It's not something we like to see as a typical advantage of creator is that fine detail may be accomplished through clever, intricate building techniques. There comes a point, however, at which components can only go so far in creating an effect without resorting to printed tiles. I say 'resort', but printed elements aren't exactly the saviour that many make them out to be - the colours have a far lower contrast, and they increase the price of a product. It's not so easy to just make a printed element.</div><div><br></div><div>We can be fortunate that, while plenty of stickers do exist here, their application isn't going to ruin anyone's life. For example, the posters on the ground level are the exact same dimensions as the window that they are applied to, meaning it is practically impossible to misplace the sticker (and make it wonky). And this is of course only if you <i>want </i>to apply the stickers, because quite frankly, the windows still look great without them. There are two of each movie poster, so you also have the option of placing them both on the back and front of the window pane. Alternatively (and the more sensible option), keep one set as a back-up and have the interior-side of the pane blank.</div><div><br></div><div>The large white element used for the cinema screen can be covered with an equally large sticker of our young actress in the frame, dancing away wildly in black and white. Again, this sticker is pretty much optional. As with the windows, some fans may have the creativity to design and apply their down details, though I would guess this may detract from the atmosphere that the cinema sutured is set in.</div><div><br></div><div>Arriving at the movie listings just below the 'Palace' signage, we then have six further stickers that complete the effect of small lettering. These are the only stickers that I would say are definitely required, but again, inventive fans may even alter this design so that they can place their own letter tiles onto a studded plate.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I shouldn't have to tell you that the 'Brick Star' emblems on the pavement are indeed printed elements, and repeat the same design on each present. These are unique to this product, so expect their value to skyrocket because they look absolutely startling. The quality is truly unsurpassed.</div><div><br></div><div>We also have an amazingly unique red baseplate, which nicely reflects the 'red carpet' nature of the building and also acts as a carpet inside the building's ground floor. I never thought I'd call a LEGO baseplate beautiful, but this is my first opportunity to do so... <i>It's beautiful.</i>&nbsp;We're not exactly treated to many colours normally, are we?</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, following on from the <i>Horizon Express</i>, we also receive yet another Brick Separator in green. A true LEGO fan can never have too many Brick Separators, as we are a strange breed. Particularly when you notice a trend for 'normal' orange separators and 'expert' green ones.</div><div><br></div><div>I'll grab my coat now...</div><div><br></div><div><b>Final Thoughts</b></div><div>Each Modular Building released has been more and more ambitious, be it for the better (<i>Pet Shop</i>)&nbsp;or worser (<i>Town Hall</i>, in my honest opinion). What makes the <i>Palace Cinema </i>special is that it packs in so many recognisable features into such a small space - one that is perhaps strained as a corner building. The overall presentation is completely faultless, and I believe the staff in Billund deserve so much credit for scaling down the small architectural features that make this building instantly recognisable. It is truly any LEGO fan's dream for either presentation or play.</div><div><br></div><div>That is the real accomplishment with this product; you'd look twice at it after walking by. It is also the inherent downfall, for fans maybe expecting more from the interior, that the lobby is larger than the screening room itself - a fault depending on how you view the model. However, if one breaks down the design as a series of separate narratives, then I can't help buy enjoy imagining what it would be like to be inside this building. <i>Palace Cinema </i>isn't perfect on blueprint, but the irony with LEGO is that these imperfections - judged from our own world - often produce the most interesting and manageable products you can buy, because the imagination is greatly enhanced.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On a scale of pure inventiveness, I rate <i>Palace Cinema </i>as being by far and away the best Modular Building so far. The only way it can be faulted is in how you yourself perceive a grand picture house.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
"David83","2014-06-22T14:01:38.193Z","A Wonderful Addition to Your Modular Street.","<p>Ok, so let me set out my stall right from the start, if it was Star Wars that got me back into Lego as an AFOL, it was the modular range that kept me collecting. I love them! So when 10232 Palace Cinema was waiting for me on my arrival home from work, my excitement was tangible! Upon opening the box and emptying out the numbered bags, I was pleasantly surprised to see two 16x16 plates in tan. A piece I have not come across before (I know, getting excited over two Lego plates goes beyond ridiculous, but hey, I&rsquo;ve yet to find any logic in being an AFOL!).</p>

<p><strong>First impressions</strong></p>

<p>The bags inside come numbered 1-3 and each stage corresponds with one of the three instruction booklets, each of which build a floor of the model, nice and systematic if you ask me! One drawback though is the inclusion of stickers, and the stickers are large which makes them slightly more difficult to apply with any level of accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>On arrival&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Ok, now to the main event, the build. The car is the precursor to the build, and is a wonderful little aperitif with some very clever building techniques, with no obvious &lsquo;car pieces&rsquo; on show but lots of the usual clever outside the box thinking using normal pieces in a very clever way, with some very inventive SNOT techniques for the bonnet.</p>

<p><strong>On entering&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>The main building starts in the same way that all the other modular start, with the pavement, whilst having the usual silver grills and white lamp, this set also has the Lego &lsquo;walk of fame&rsquo; stars which were thankfully on printed tiles and looked great! The first floor of the theatre is beautiful, cleverly blending build techniques and the lateral thinking you would expect from a modular used to create the box office and refreshment area. Both areas look great with very clear detailing for features like the popcorn oven, sweet jar and drinks dispenser, with the box office &lsquo;hole in the wall&rsquo; a very nice addition indeed.</p>

<p><strong>Let the show begin&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>Floor number two is perhaps slightly more basic in the technical element but is no less impressive, in fact, maybe even more so for this. The finished article really captures the essence of an old cinema screen and gives a really good atmospheric feel to the build. The windows running at a 45 degree angle on the corner of the building are ingeniously designed and I was kept wondering how this was going to be placed right up to the point the instructions told me. Again I was slightly disappointed with the use of stickers. On the cinema screen one it is a slightly different shape to the element that you apply it to so is more difficult to place centrally with any accuracy. I understand that the printed elements may be expensive to make, but when paying a premium price for a premium product, one has a certain expectation. On the flip side, there is more imaginative usage of SNOT techniques to construct the projector which is, for me, the highlight of the floor.</p>

<p><strong>From a distance&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>With stage three we get to the magnificent roof and the palace sign of this fine build. There are some very sophisticated pieces of design work here, with the sloped roof, the red sloped tower and the highlight of the model, the palace sign. A key feature of the modular buildings seems to be the use of Lego pieces to &lsquo;write&rsquo; some sort of inscription in the finished piece. Now, whilst the town hall (10224), fire brigade (10197) and pet shop (10218) are in my opinion more difficult designs and techniques, and more cleverly put together (there was a real &lsquo;wow&rsquo; factor when building them!), this one is far more striking as it is readable from both sides whilst remaining in keeping with and in fact enhancing the final product.</p>

<p><strong>Final thoughts&hellip;</strong></p>

<p>This is a lovely model with all the usual good features that are unique to the modular range, the palace sign and the design of the roof are especially well done, the simple but effective flood lights and barriers for opening night are a great little addition, with the limousine and the internal detail being particular high points. A slight criticism however, is the lack of a seating area by the refreshment desk; I believe the designer could have moved the desk back towards the wall slightly to make room for this. The biggest downer though is the necessary use of stickers. When paying such a high price it is too easy to ruin the whole model with one wrongly placed or squint sticker. Nevertheless, this is a lovely build, and a beautiful looking model with a lot of character that will be a wonderful addition to your modular street.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box is huge, and the build looks huge when we looking on the box. There is nothing unsusal comparing to the others LEGO boxes, scale and&nbsp;informations on the side, and functions on the back.</p>

<p>There are 3 instructions in form of small books. SIze remind small cataloques from 90&#39;s.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>There is a lot of standard bricks and plates you can use to build houses, walls etc. 32x32 red baseplate, arches we can use to build castles, small windows, big glasses, door, wings in br. red and new dark red colour, accesories usefull in other themes like daggers, or harpoon guns.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>5 quite normall minifigs and 1 child minifig, just simply townsmans with classic grin faces.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build is pretty fun and challenging because of similar colours! Thanks to LEGO tha they spared parts in numered bags. I builded it with my girlfriend (she is not afol!) and it take us 4 hours! And she really like it.</p>

<p>Thanks to that there are 3 instructions, 10232 is fun build is fun for three people, each can take instruction and bag with same number and have fun!</p>

<p>The build show us how can we alternatively use minifig accesories.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The completed model is smaller that it looks on the box, but i really like it, very detailed. I dont like only the roof from barrels, but generally must have in your LEGOCITY, no matter You are kid, teenager or adult fan of LEGO.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>A lot of bricks for this price, very usefull bricks. Comparing to the other sets with similar parts quantity the is good value of money.</p>

Supporters have praised its architecture, especially the marquee, and its atmosphere; detractors have criticized its limited playability, lack of internal interest, and poor design. I agree with the latter: the choice of a cinema brought with it challenges that the designers declined to address, and the result is simplistic and uncreative.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Conception. </b>The set clearly draws inspiration from the famous portico of Grauman&rsquo;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California, built in 1926 and &rsquo;27. The two theatres share trapezoidal roofs behind upturned arches, and in Grauman&rsquo;s case this distinctive feature attests to its &ldquo;exotic revival&rdquo; architecture. Grauman&rsquo;s, and by extension 10232, offers an orientalist, non-specific representation of supposed Chinese culture to largely non-Chinese audiences. Lego now engages with Chinese culture in more interesting and earnest ways for sets oriented towards the Chinese market, for instance the Monkie Kid and Lunar New Year lines.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">In the designer video for the set, still available on YouTube, Astrid Graab&aelig;k says that an intern, Jordan Swats (I haven&rsquo;t been able to verify the spelling), came up with the concept for the set and that she, Astrid, &ldquo;finalized&rdquo; the design. The division of labor appears unintentionally revealing, suggesting as it does that an essential middle step was elided, namely designing the model. To my mind, it explains a lot.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Design.</b> 10232&rsquo;s marquee constitutes the most impressive feature of the set, and draws one&rsquo;s eye. It&rsquo;s a classic Broadway-style piece, with its rows of exposed lightbulbs illuminating a signboard and the name of the theatre. From the beginning of the modular line, designers have delighted in the design of letters, but the &ldquo;Palace&rdquo; here must be one of the least sophisticated examples.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The remainder of the fa&ccedil;ade is plain and lacks detail. Much of what detail does exist comes from non-constructed sources: the two types of textured bricks, and the stickers with their puns and references. No other modular includes stickers or uses prints to the degree that 10232 uses stickers, and for the good reason that modulars shouldn&rsquo;t need them to add interest. The wordplay of 10232 is amusing, but not a substitute for creative design.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The interior could have been designed in the late &rsquo;90s. It&rsquo;s sparse, with an exposed baseplate, and the few features that are present are simplistic. In other modulars, the interior provides an opportunity for clever bits of furniture, architectural ornaments, and novel parts usage. Even when spare interiors were common, the few features that were present were interestingly designed, for instance the marvelous radiator of 10185 Green Grocer. Not so here.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The set&rsquo;s other bits&mdash;the automobile, the spotlights, the barriers&mdash;feel extraneous, and are not integral to the set, as if they&rsquo;re included to justify the price. Of the minifigures, the cinema employee&rsquo;s torso originated as a striped shirt for a fish, which results in a strangely deep collar. The photographer&rsquo;s exposed shirtsleeves and tan hat are similarly inappropriate for the role supposedly being depicted, and the female minifigure in the gold blouse has been repeated from 10218. As a whole, the minifigures appear carelessly chosen.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The interior of 10232 isn&rsquo;t uninteresting for want of potential. One could imagine, for instance, a pair of arcade machines or at least a bathroom filling out the lowest floor, or a functioning popcorn popper as was designed for 30364 Popcorn Cart. Its near-contemporary, 70751 Temple of Airjitzu, features a functioning shadow puppet theatre. Such features would have added much-needed open-ended playability. Measured by what it provides, the set is merely middling. Measured by what it might have provided, and by what the other modulars provide, it becomes decidedly poor.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Verisimilitude.</b> Previous reviewers have debated 10232&rsquo;s verisimilitude, especially in its windows, small seating capacity, and lack of a projection booth. Regardless of their views, nearly all reviewers implicitly acknowledge verisimilitude as a desirable characteristic. I don&rsquo;t necessarily agree, but the existence of the debate suggests a conflict between the set&rsquo;s ostensible function as a cinema and its actual function as a piece for display and perhaps play.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The essence of a cinema is a dark auditorium full of chairs, which doesn&rsquo;t necessarily make for interesting external or internal architecture. Grauman&rsquo;s offers one solution to the problem of decorating a featureless box with its overheated exoticism and massive sculptural elements. Lego, freed from the restrictions of functionality, have simply ignored the problem and added windows, which in their size, shape, frames, and placement are one of the most effective ways to balance detail and broad contours, as in 10190 Market Street or 10243 Parisian Restaurant. I have patronized a cinema with windows myself, but they&rsquo;re antithetical to its functioning. In the case of 10232 they signal Lego&rsquo;s inability or unwillingness to reconcile less-than-ideal subject matter with the aesthetic demands of the modular buildings.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">10232 suffers from an apparent lack of imagination and care. Its architectural contours and sculptural elements overwhelm what little detail is present, and the dull, empty interior represents a missed opportunity. One star.</span></span></span></p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2018-05-05T19:24:15.33Z","Second Movie Theatre Since Town Plan","<p>I received&nbsp; this set for Christmas nearly five years ago during the start of a three year long period where I stopped writing reviews&nbsp;on Brickset. Having a newfound appreciation for the modular line, especially after building&nbsp;10255 Assembly Square, I felt that I should give my two cents on the Palace Cinema for completeness sake since this is the only modular I own which hasn&#39;t been reviewed yet.</p>

<p>The Palace Cinema is the 8th modular building succeeding 10224 Town Hall&nbsp;and preceding 10243 Parisian Restaurant. It was only my second modular after 10211 Grand Emporium so it was quite a welcome addition to my growing&nbsp;collection. The build is divided into 3 bags - Bag 1 deals with the main floor and car, Bag 2 involves the second floor, and the roof and sign are built in Bag 3. Having built this set so long ago I don&#39;t remember exactly how long it took but I think it was around 8-10 hours.</p>

<p>Six minifigures&nbsp;are included, including child star, photographer, chauffeur, employee, and male and female patrons. Some accessories include a camera,&nbsp;ticket stubs (which are just 1x1 tiles), and dollar bills.&nbsp;Also of interest is the 1930&#39;s style convertible, which makes Palace Cinema the second modular of three to include a vehicle, the others being 10197 Fire Brigade and this year&#39;s own 10260 Downtown Diner. The proportions of the convertible are somewhat distorted due to the (very) tall front and gives the illusion that the front windscreen is obscured. Nonetheless a neat little addition to the main modular.</p>

<p>On the sidewalk spanning both corners of the cinema is a walk of fame, featuring eight 2x2 tan tiles with a printed star-brick design used to represent some famous actor/actress. Aside from the white&nbsp;lampost used in many other modulars&nbsp;there are no other fixtures on the sidewalk. Two fences sit loosely leading up to the entrance, and two&nbsp;spotlights are included which also sit loose.&nbsp;The left side of the building features posters for three movies in screening, including &quot;Brick Separator&quot;, &quot;Mystery on the Monorail&quot;, and &quot;Forever Sorting&quot;, all of which are humourous&nbsp;references to Lego in some way. The building&#39;s right side includes two ticket windows and has slots at the bottom where the tickets can slide through. The entrance doors are done ingeniously and are built using actual bricks, using&nbsp;1x2x5 clear bricks for glass and gold 4L bars as the door handles. The first floor is the lobby and includes a couple of cash registers for buying tickets, and a concession stand with popcorn machine, drink dispenser, and candy dispenser. There are three containers on the counter which I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re used for. A large staircase at the back leads up to the second floor. The building sits on a red baseplate&nbsp;to represent the famous &quot;red carpet&quot; effect. Tiling is not used in the lobby.</p>

<p>The second floor is the theatre&nbsp;itself. There is&nbsp;a large movie screen decorated with a red curtain and gold crown. Six seats are provided and a projector sits on top of a platform which plays the movies. A chair is also on the platform where the operator sits. Another set of stairs leads up to the roof through an emergency exit which is a standard 1x4x6 door mounted on its side.</p>

<p>Despite being almost entirely plain except for the emergency exit, the roof is actually very well done. The roof slopes are built using individual 1x1 red and burgundy bricks to simulate tiles. Even though it sits&nbsp;on turnstile pieces to achieve the angled construction, the spire is solidly mounted. At the ends of the roof and both sides of the spire are <em>sai&#39;s&nbsp;</em>which serve as decoration, as well as a Chinese rice farmer&#39;s hat which sits above the &quot;Palace&quot; sign.</p>

<p>The &quot;Palace&quot; sign is probably the main highlight of the set for many. It is intricately built using assorted light blue and white plates, as well as white 1x2 bricks with pin hole. Unlike in 10182 Cafe Corner where the &quot;E&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in &quot;Hotel&quot; were reversed, the sign is two studs deep to accommodate correct lettering on both sides. A&nbsp;movie screening sign right above the entrance completes the signage assembly, showing the screening for &quot;Three Clicks and a Snap&quot; starring Minnie Figure (another humourous&nbsp;play on words). The assembly is mounted onto the building using clips and an extruded plate sits underneath to support the sign.</p>

<p>The early 20th century oriental theme is captured very well by the overall design. I&#39;m assuming this would be something you&#39;d find in Hollywood during this era. While the building techniques used for the main building are not spectacular, it cleans up well and gets the job done. As usual, the backsides are almost entirely plain since the expectation is that they&#39;ll be covered up by other modulars. However, there is some detailing using light grey brick bricks which represent exposed wall due to wear and tear.</p>

<p>From others&#39; reviews, I can see this is the least popular modular building thus far. Why? Some think that the build is repetitve, uninspired, or unfinished. Others have attributed it to the lack of detail in the lobby and unrealistic setup of the theatre and projector.&nbsp;Personally, I do agree that the lobby feels a little quiet, but it&#39;s by no means an issue for me. Others believe the projector should be in its own room, but I think having it on a platform is acceptable due to space constraints. My only real gripe is the windows on the second floor. They should be covered since the theatre&nbsp;should be dark during screening. On the other hand, replacing the brown windows with solid bricks or panels would be off puttting. What could&#39;ve been done was to replace all the clear panes with opaque panes to simulate curtains or blinds (in fact, take a look at the photography studio windows in Assembly Square). Also, an ongoing issue at the time was the lack of window panes for the curved windows. I don&#39;t think these exist yet, all I know is that for the modulars where these curved windows were used they didn&#39;t have any panes because the piece was never produced. I guess we&#39;ll wait and see.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think Palace Cinema is worth having since movie theatres are pretty much non existent. The previous movie theatre&nbsp;came in 10184 Town Plan.&nbsp;At 2196 pieces and $200 CAD its price was pretty standard for a modular but still fairly decent. I&#39;m sure by now this set has been MOC&#39;ed&nbsp;quite extensively by others, but in its original form I think it&#39;s perfectly fine.</p>

"indykid","2020-06-18T00:57:08.88Z","Been waiting for something like this","<p>I get there&#39;s probably nobody reading reviews for this set these days since it&#39;s only available on third party websites but in case anyone needs a fresh opinion...</p>

<p>I got 10182 Cafe Corner and 10211 Grand Emporium when they came out&nbsp;when I was a kid. I remember seeing this on the LEGO website when it was first released and I was studying film in college and really wanted it but never had the money. Now that I&#39;m an adult, I thought I&#39;d give my inner kid some wish fulfilment with my disposable income.&nbsp;I always wanted a movie theater LEGO set since I&#39;ve been a huge movie fan forever and even bought the&nbsp;1349&nbsp;Steven Spielberg Moviemaker Set on eBay years ago. I have to say I was not disappointed and it was a great way to pass the time for a few days during&nbsp;lockdown back in March.</p>

<p>In regard to price this was the first LEGO set I&#39;d bought in almost a decade&nbsp;so I didn&#39;t exactly have a point of reference before I overpaid for it. My only recommendation for that would be to find it as cheap as you can.</p>

<p>The 40s Buick has some nice detail but it&#39;s a little awkward placing any more than 1 minifig in the back-seat. The side view mirrors are particularly cool and I enjoy the small gold grate that serves as the dashboard console.</p>

<p>The sidewalk is completely empty compared to&nbsp;other modular sets but it allows a lot of creative movement for the stanchions and spotlights. The stars on the sidewalk are a lovely detail. Was a little disappointed by the movie posters being stickers but I was surprised at how easy it was to apply them without any mishaps. I love the tiny slot at the box office for tickets (grey 1x1 tiles instead of the printed ticket tiles for some reason)&nbsp;and money to slide through. I didn&#39;t notice it until after I had completed building and was delighted by the surprise. It&#39;s easier to push stuff in from the sidewalk than it is to push things out from the box office. The front doors were a fun build and look really elegant. The interior I&#39;ll say is a little empty. The ticket counter has a neat little plant and the concession stand is extremely detailed. The gold slope/wedges that are part of the concessions are impossible to take out without taking apart the back counter so you&#39;re better off using the wedges left over from extra pieces&nbsp;when giving minifigs concessions from the counter. The plant by the stairs is pretty flimsy but since it&#39;s in a corner it&#39;s low impact. The space between the ticket counter and stairs is pretty empty; some people say a seating area would be nice but I&#39;d be content with just a podium for ticket taking even.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second floor with the actual theater is pretty cool. It&#39;s period appropriate for 20s/early 30s era silent film theaters with the projector and seating in one big room. The projectionist seat is a nice touch. I think that if the hole for the stairs was a bit narrower there could be a few more seats but it adds to the vintage/restored cinema vibe for limited seating capacity. The fact that there&#39;re windows surrounding the seats and movie screen is pretty goofy but Modulars are supposed to be minifig scale so it would be hard to correct this without making it more cramped inside. The movie screen is sticker not printed. The skeleton leg railing on the exterior is great detail and the alternating slopes/brick pattern 1x2 bricks along the top of the second floor look great&nbsp;despite being a markedly different color from most of the exterior.</p>

<p>Not sure why there&#39;s roof access since there&#39;s not much to see up top but the slanted roof facade is a nice mini build and looks super cool&nbsp;when completed. The main tower on the corner has no back which looks strange from behind, though the same could be said about the slanted roof on either side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last part of the build is the sign and marquee (stickers again) which is another great mini build and a nice way to end things. It&#39;s very sturdy--much sturdier than the HOTEL sign from Cafe Corner--and the PALACE sign is double sided so that it reads correctly from both sides unlike the HOTEL sign. Gold details and studs for lights are really great visually.</p>

<p>The minifigs are nice (though a bit overdressed for the other Modular Buildings) and there&#39;s a lot for one set&nbsp;but there&#39;s only one theater attendant which seems like an oversight since there&#39;re tickets concessions&nbsp;and a projector to run. Also, there&#39;s not an obvious place for the stanchions and spotlights if you&#39;re not in &quot;movie premiere&quot; mode but putting them on the roof hides them well enough.</p>

<p>This uses some really great pieces and has a really nice level of detail overall. Because the entire building is dedicated to the movie theater there is some limited playability compared to something like 10243 Parisian Restaurant or 10260 Downtown Diner but I&#39;m just so happy to have a LEGO cinema finally that I don&#39;t mind! I had a lot of fun building this even though I wasn&#39;t as wowed by&nbsp;some of building techniques compared to other Modular sets. It looks great next to Cafe Corner and especially Grand Emporium. I wasn&#39;t expecting it but this set really got me back into the Modular Building series that I loved so much as a kid.

<p>When I first saw this set, I was very wary of the architectural style. However, at the start of 2016, I found at a very good price, and since I needed a cinema in my Lego City, I bought it.&nbsp; I found out that the Oriental-style architecture that had turned me off, was in fact very popular during the 1930s, thus making it an important feature. But, sadly, I was let down in many other aspects of the model, which I will explain, and which is why I have given Palace Cinema an average rating.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box is about regular size for a modular box, but lacks the new `Expert` cube` symbol. Instead, it has a yellow diagonal stripe on the bottom right hand corner, which says, `expert. ` The top of the roof of the cinema is cut off, but all the other included models are presented well. Some Edwardian-style townhouses are also watermarked onto the background. On the upper right hand side of the box are two squares, one showing the dimensions of the model, the other showing how the different floors are removed. The instructions are fairly easy to follow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most noticeable part in this set is the exclusive 2x2 star printed tile. It is a tan background with a dark red star and a 1x1 tab brick in the centre of the star. There are a lot of tan and dark red elements in Palace Cinema. Some useful parts include the 1x2 textured `brick pattern` in light blueish grey, the black Ninjago swords and the many, many gold pieces, such as the 1x1 round tile, 1x1 cheese slope and the Chinese hat. There are also the 3 brown door frames. Most importantly is the exclusive red base plate, which represents a red carpet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 6 minifigures included in this set. There is a cinema employee, a child actress (named Minnie Figure), her chauffeur, a news reporter with a camera, a male patron and female patron. This is a very low amount of minifigures, but it is the common amount for modular buildings.</p>

<p>I really like how the male and female patron are dressed. The designers have shown how people of the 1930s (and other eras as well) always dressed formally for the cinema. The cinema employee&rsquo;s torso print is very nice and appropriate, however, at least one more employee would have been better. The reporter is very plain, as is the chauffeur, and while her torso print is nice, Minnie Figure is also not a very good figure. Although, I do like the idea of including a child actress, which is very creative. Also, the news reporter&rsquo;s camera is very wrong. His camera should be like the one in Town Hall.&nbsp; In fact, the cameras in Palace Cinema and Town Hall should be swapped.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build </strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like all modulars, the build is long and sometimes boring. The PALACE sign is very hard to place and the build of the Mexican-style tiled roof is also rather boring, as is placing all the 1x1 round studs. There is also a lot of repetition when building the columns. (building the back walls can be annoying if you don`t enjoy stacking bricks) The build is not all that bad, but nor is it that enjoyable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When built, you are left with a two storey cinema, two spotlights and a vintage car.</p>

<p>The supposed limousine, is best described as a 1941 Hudson convertible. The designers have very well captured the front of the car but that&#39;s about it. The front uses some sideways building. The whole car is too long and low to the ground. The wheel arches are absolutely horrible and the windshield is too low. The inside of the car is just plain odd. The limousine is just like the year it is supposed to be from, an absolute disaster.</p>

<p>The two spotlights are nice builds but completely unnecessary. The designers should have used the parts for a better car, or a more detailed interior.</p>

<p><strong>Exterior:</strong></p>

<p>The whole cinema is a corner build and I think this was a good choice. On one side is the usual white lamppost and two ticket booths build into the wall, on the other side is some movie posters. There are also two black barriers, again rather unnecessary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The movie posters are stickers (any modular building with stickers should stick in the designers mind...) showing The Brick Separator, which includes Legoified versions of the designers names, (probably a reference to the original 1933 Godzilla film), Mystery on the Monorail, which is very similar to the very famous Lego airport monorail (this probably references the many mystery/detective movies at the time, such as the original Sherlock Holmes movies and the Charlie Chan movies), and finally Forever Sorting, (There were many 1930s romantic films ). The movie posters are on both sides.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(note* To correspond with the release of The Lego Movie in 2014, Lego gave away some exclusive Lego Movie posters which could be swapped for the already included ones, although there was only 1 Lego Movie poster, so you could not have it on both sides)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two brick-built doors which wedge together perfectly, although they are very hard to open again once fully closed. There are also some gold light saber bars as door handles which are very appropriate and nice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above this is the cinema sign. The Now Showing sign is very well built, realistic and creative. The PALACE word is brick built, also very well done in white with an odd choice of a light sky blue background. The Now Showing sign also includes some light sky blue pieces and makes use of some SNOT techniques. A row of lights (1x1 transparent yellow studs) runs down the side.</p>

<p>Some lights stick out from each corner of the building and point upwards. There are some indents added as architectural features on the top of each floor and a black fence is in front of the windows on the second floor.</p>

<p>The windows are built into the wall and are built behind an archway on both sides. There are 3 `stacks` of windows on each side, the top window is arched and has no glass in it. This is yet another of Palace Cinema`s flaws, I don`t know why Lego would leave them open and not create a new glass piece for that particular window, which would have been very useful in custom MOCs. The middle section behind the PALACE sign is just 2x2 square windows.</p>

<p>The roof also has 3 sections, the middle one is a tower-like spire, such as the one in Green Grocer. Underneath is the previously mention golden Chinese hat piece. The tower has an upside down arch in front of it (a good use of pieces) and the two Ninjago swords pointing out. The same swords are found on the ends of the other sections. (I think that these sword pieces look very out of place). The other roofs are tilted back a bit and use dark red, red and brown cylinder pieces to give a Mexican-style rustic roof, which again looks odd.</p>

<p><strong>Interior:</strong></p>

<p>The interior includes a ticket area, candy bar and staircase. The candy bar has a grey and light blue desk with a jar of gobstoppers. There are some drinks on the side and a back desk with some candy on the bottom and a popcorn machine and drink (or soft serve) dispenser. For a modular building, this is horrible. It is the sort of detail found in a City or Friends set, which is good, but not in a $200+ set. The popcorn machine is the worst. It&rsquo;s a classic mailbox with white studs in it. If it was in City, fine, but these are the designers who can make ceiling fans out of snowshoes and skylights out of garage doors, where is the creativity, or at least effort? The dispenser is also the bare minimum for effort.</p>

<p>On the other side is the ticket area. Again, it has the same grey and blue desk, this time with a plant in a vase (a clear minifigure head) on the corner. There are large windows with slits built into them and a 2x2 cheese slope, where tickets and money is exchanged, similar to in Brick Bank. The two cash registers are very bad. Firstly, they are way too modern, secondly, they are again an example of lazy designers. While I do appreciate them being prints and not stickers, it would have been a lot better to have included brick built ones which would have added to the building experience and realism. I think a design like the one in Grand Emporium would have been best.</p>

<p>There is a plant near the ticket counter and one in the corner created by the spiral part of the staircase.&nbsp; The staircase uses regular spiral pieces in black for a 90 degree turn at the bottom then uses a regular stair piece in black with tiles on them and a very plain handrail. The hand rail is similar to the ones on the escalators in Grand Emporium, but the dark grey and brown don`t look right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some lamps (3) on the wall facing the movie posters and that&rsquo;s it. The lobby is too plain. At least one seat (maybe bench style) is needed and maybe a large brick built poster. I know that cinemas have large open areas to allow space for lines and people to stand and wait, but it feels like wasted space, they could have at made a long plant feature with seats around it.</p>

<p>The stairs lead to the second floor which is the auditorium/viewing room. There is a plain wooden banister and stairs giving roof access.</p>

<p>The screen is a white 8x16 modified tile with studs around the outside, to which red wedge plates are attached, acting as curtains. The screen itself is a large sticker showing a black and white musical. The sticker screen is oddly cut off at both ends giving a trapezium shape.</p>

<p>There are 2 rows of 3 seats in red, which are made up of two 1x2 slope pieces as armrests and a red flag piece attached vertically, which allows minifigures to recline their seat. Due to how minifigures are shaped, you can only fit 2 minifigures in each row by placing a minifigure, space and minifigure. Two more rows of seats could have fitted and it would not have been hard to add a plate under the second row to give some sort of tiered seating.</p>

<p>Behind this is the projector. The build of the projector itself is great, I really like it, but everything else is not so good. Firstly, the whole thing is on a stand and open to the rest of the cinema. This is fine for an Edwardian/WW1 era cinema but not for a 1930s cinema. A curtain build with sliding doors, would have been a good addition to hide the projector. The projector operator has the same seat (bar armrests) as the patrons, which is odd. The windows are unrealistic, but that is fine as the room needs light to see the details and otherwise the building would be a giant plain box. As a positive, it is very architecturally appealing cinema.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roof access is by the stairs and a sideways attached door. Roof access in this model was a complete waste of pieces and space. The designers could have used the room for some other details (like a toilet or VIP seating). The roof has no detail whatsoever, the backs of the roof sections are open and the plates for roof support are visible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, as Time Goes By, Palace Cinema will be forgotten. The exterior detail is average, the interior detail is very disappointing, the car and spotlights are also disappointing. The minifigures are average and there are lots of historical inaccuracies. If you are really desperate for a Lego cinema, and can get it for a bargain, Palace Cinema is OK. But for full price, it&rsquo;s one of the worst modulars I`ve seen.</p>

<p>*note The title of this review, Build it Again Sam, is a reference to the 1942 classic film, Casablanca. The actual line is Play It Again Sam, the song that Sam plays is As Time Goes By. However, the line Play It Again Sam, is completely wrong, which represents all the inaccuracies of Palace Cinema and my opinion that the whole model should be built again.</p>
