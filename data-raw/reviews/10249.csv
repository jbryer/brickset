 <o:p>My reaction to the launch of Chima was &ldquo;meh, a Ninjago type kid thing.&rdquo; However, after receiving my bonus Ewar Arco-fighter, I was charmed by this little guy.</o:p></p>
<p>
 <o:p>
 <p class=""MsoNormal"">
  The torso is printed font and back with a gold wing design.&nbsp; The legs have more gold detailing and eagle claws.&nbsp; His head has a plain bird face on one side and goggles on the other.&nbsp; The winged helmet with beak is excellent (and makes me wish for a similar design for Aragorn&rsquo;s eventual Gondorian design.&nbsp; Minus the beak of course.)&nbsp;&nbsp; His golden harness/epaulette piece holds the wings with two white clips which allow the wings to articulate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p class=""MsoNormal"">
  His vehicle has an eagle vibe with a tail generated with two double wide cheese slopes and the beak implied with a 1x1 yellow plate.&nbsp; The skis for water landing gear and a couple of blue clips with rings over his blue wings, provide the power functions.</p>
 <p>
  Overall the blue and white with gold palette is very pleasing.&nbsp; When mounted on the vehicle,&nbsp; Ewar gets a good swoosh rating. Grabbing him by the tail gives a good grip and maneuverability. He started knocking over Mirkwood spiders, just for practice with some local evil at my house.</p>

"tmgm528","2013-01-29T15:27:36.95Z","A Great Start To Chima","I recently went to my local Lego store and bought the Arkham Asylum and got this set for free with my purchase over $75.00. I was skeptical about the Legends Of Chima sets at first. They looked very kiddy and Ninjago-ish what I have gotten somewhat tired of over 3 years. Read on to find out what I thought.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Ewar was an excellent figure with plenty of great new pieces.</li><li>The new Chi and neck piece are great.</li><li>Excellent use of the small amount of bricks you get for the Acro-Fighter.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>The only con I have is that considering its an exclusive set there is not an exclusive figure and can easily be built with pieces around the house.</li></ul><p>Conclusion/Overall</p><p>This was a good set considering it was free. I would recommend it if you are skeptical about Chima. If you already have Ewar from Razar's Chi Raider I would not highly recommend it because you can build the Acro-Fighter from extra pieces in your Lego collection.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-11-09T21:04:57.64Z","Free Offer and Ewar","<p><strong>Set #30250 Ewar's Acro Fighter: </strong>In January of this year when you spent 75$ before taxes on LEGO this was the free polybag you would recieve. Fast Forward to the end of Summer and TRU recieved a large number of excess stock from LEGO which they offered as part of a free deal for spending a certain amount, or you could purchase it for the&nbsp;standard Polybag price of 4.99$</p>
<p>Ewar's Acro Fighter is a small one-man flying/hover vehicle from the Legends of Chima universe, it shares the Eagle Tribe's overall vehicle design of resembling the animal they are based on. (Namely an Eagle.) This small vehicle looks ok, for a free gift, even paying 5$ for it it's a decent little build, quick and easy to build and fun to use with larger Eagle Tribe vehicles this looks great next to the Eagle Interceptor.</p>
<p>Ewar himself is a great design for a Mini-Figure, the Chima line/Theme goes all out by including double-sided torsos, highly detailed leg prints, double-sided faces and great helmet/head pieces that look like animal styled helmets. This Polybag also includes the gold torso armor, which makes sense as without that armor the Eagle tribe members can't include their wings. The only real downside to this Mini-Figure is the lack of any sort of weapon, the only accessory included here is a Chi crystal.</p>
<p>Overall this is a must have Polybag for Polybag collectors, and Eagle Tribe lovers. As long as you can find it for a good price, the scarcity of the Polybag in that it wasn't available everywhere means you'll be paying high prices for getting it on the secondary market. Kids might enjoy one of the larger sets more, this is more for kids who want something to go with the larger Eagle Tribe sets, as an introduction to the Theme it doesn't quite meet expectations. It is a great little parts pack though if you can get it at retail prices.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
"IanRohan","2014-03-06T05:04:29.083Z","The epic winged eagle-person and his flying sled","<p>Read the title. This set is about Ewar, not the thing he&#39;s flying on. So is it worth your money? Let me think about that while you read my review...</p>

<p>Box and Instructions - Not a lot to say here. It&#39;s a polybag&nbsp;with an instruction booklet about big enough for a mouse.</p>

<p>Parts - Besides the parts of Ewar himself, on which I will soon&nbsp;elaborate, this set lacks a great deal of significant pieces. The earth blue angle plates may be interesting to some (I own 8086 Droid Tri-fighter, so I now have fourteen of them...), and snowshoes are always a good find. The Chi crystal can be found in almost every Chima&nbsp;set but in virtually no other theme. The rest of the parts are quite commonplace: more angle plates, some slopes, regular plates, handlebars...</p>

<p>Minifigures - This set includes one member of Chima&#39;s Eagle Tribe, namely Ewar, and I must say he&#39;s quite a figure. The chest, back, and legs are all&nbsp;stunningly printed with armor, muscles, talons, and what I assume are feathers; the double-sided head boasts a beak and suitably bird-like eyes, with one side wearing orange goggles. The highlights are the&nbsp;molded wings and helmet/head, which really cause Ewar to stand out.&nbsp;He carries the aforementioned&nbsp;Chi crystal, apparently&nbsp;in place of a weapon.</p>

<p>The Build - Let&#39;s say the build isn&#39;t the high point here; it takes all of one minute, and the instructions are hardly necessary. It uses few innovative techniques and really just drives towards making the finished model remind one of an eagle (which the twenty-two parts do quite well).</p>

<p>The Finished Model - The finished set is somewhat dwarfed by its pilot and reminds me more of a sled than an airship; nevertheless, there is something endearing about the inaccurate scale and especially the resemblance to an eagle. Chima sets&nbsp;always&nbsp;resemble their respective tribes, and despite the limited parts available, the Acro-fighter&nbsp;definitely follows suit; the head is especially eagle-like, although it uses but one plate and one slope! It is pleasingly swooshable, and the sled-like landing gear causes it to appear equally at home on land or in the sky. My only real complaint is the lack of weaponry for Ewar: I mean, what&#39;s he going to do? Throw the Chi crystal? Slap some Ravens with his wings? :P</p>

<p>Overall Thoughts - It&#39;s a good set if you&#39;re starting out with Chima, building a Chima army, looking to entertain a kid, or just like flying little ships&nbsp;around (and come on, Lego builders, you know we all do that at least occasionally!). There is little point in it as a parts package unless you want cheap, awesome wings (this is why I bought it, and it was worth it). If you&#39;re a minifigure collector, Ewar&nbsp;is quite a hard-to-find character and this is well worth your money. So if you find a billion of this set collecting dust in Target or TRU, I&#39;d say pick one up just for fun.</p>

"eSkywalker","2014-12-28T02:29:33.12Z","Awesome minifigure!","<p>Lets first say that I got this set free with a purchase and I am not familiar with the Chima line.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a polybag set so that&#39;s pretty much business as usual :)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice colour&nbsp;scheme on the &quot;Acro-Fighter&quot; which is basically a little snow-mobile. I like it because it doesn&#39;t take attention away from Ewar, the star of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Great minifigure! Awesome head piece, nice golden chest piece, and two large wings out the back that attach to the gold part. Lots of printing on the torso, like&nbsp;muscles and other details.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a quick build, as is expected with the size of the set. Assemble the minifigure, build the vehicle, and place the accessories in the minifigure&#39;s hands.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When completed, the set is about 3-4&quot; long by about 2&quot; wide. It sticks out beside other polybag sets because of its stylish, white&nbsp;colouring.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>8.5/10 because of a really great and detailed minifigure.</p>
