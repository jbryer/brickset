<p>For reasons best known to LEGO&#39;s marketing department, the UK was the last country in the world to&nbsp;get the GS sets, but at least both the first- and second-wave sets&nbsp;have been released together. I won&#39;t bother reviewing the first batch because I suspect you all already have them, so I&#39;ll concentrate on the new ones.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=70706-1"" title=""View set details"">70706</a> Crater Creeper is in the middle of the price range, at &pound;17.99 or $19.99 for 171 pieces. It consists of a fearsome looking bug --&nbsp;some sort of&nbsp;beetle --&nbsp;with snapping mandibles, and a small hover-craft for the squaddie.</p>

<hr />
<hr />
<h2>Box and contents</h2>

<p>The back of the box shows the bug in detail and illustrates how its mandibles open and close. The QR coder at the bottom promises to show you the Crater Creeper in action, but alas, it currently leads to an error 404 (page not found).</p>

<p>Inside we get four bags of parts in unnumbered bags, instructions and two sticker sheets. Is this a new trend, putting two stickers sheets in sets, in case you mess one set up? It certainly would make sense given they cost next to nothing and having two sheets might prevent calls to customer services for replacements, thus saving money in the long run.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>The set has not yet been inventoried at BrickLink, but I believe the minifigs are identical&nbsp;to those in the first batch of Galaxy Squad sets, which is perhaps a shame: it would have been nice to have some unique ones.</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s the completed beetle and the hover-craft. The alien sits neatly within the bug. There are plenty of flick-fire missiles. I guess kids like them, but personally I get a little tired of them being shoe-horned onto every model these days. The legs and mandibles&nbsp;use a part originally from Hero Factory. The middle legs can be moved up and down, but otherwise their geometry is fixed, which is a shame. An elastic band keeps the mandibles closed.</p>

<p>The hover-craft is a nice model in its own right and reminds me of of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6815-1"" title=""View set details"">6815</a> Exploriens Hovertron from 1996.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back of the bug features a trans-red canopy but it&#39;s fixed and there&#39;s nothing under it except&nbsp;a clip to mount the alien&#39;s blaster when not in use, which then doubles as a &#39;stinger&#39; for the beetle. (although I&#39;m not sure that Beetles have stingers!)</p>

<p>If the squaddie gets too close the pincers can snap shut to capture him and his craft...</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>I have always liked building insects and bugs (in fact my model&nbsp;for the building challenge on the Inside Tour was an ant) so I have a soft-spot for models such as this. There isn&#39;t a lot of playability, or movement, but it&#39;s a good display piece. As with all Galaxy Squad sets, the minifigs are great and perhaps the best aliens LEGO has made to date.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Parts: 4 -- nothing new, legs and pincers&nbsp;are not much use other than for, er,&nbsp;legs and pincers</li>
	<li>Playability:&nbsp;2 -- not a great deal to do with it, and not a lot of movement</li>
	<li>Building experience: 4 -- a few SNOT techniques keep it interesting</li>
	<li>Value for money: 4 -- pretty good at &pound;17.99, $19.99 (10p/11c a piece)</li>
	<li>Overall: 4 -- a model every&nbsp;Galaxy Squad fan will want</li>

Crater Creeper isn’t a big fancy set, but it isn’t disappointing at all. When I
first saw a picture online I was underwhelmed and figured I wouldn’t end up
getting the set. However, when I saw it built in a store I was more impressed,
and for $20 I went ahead and bought it.<o:p></o:p></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;""><br></span></p><p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul><li><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"">Minifigures:
I’ve always been a fan of the Galaxy Squad minifigs. The human, Chuck
Stonebreaker, has green printed body armor and a green helmet to match. His
head is double-sided so it can be turned around inside the helmet to look
different (however it looks very strange without the helmet). The alien Buggoid
is great and its unique head is much sturdier than the alien Moquitoid (which
has antennae that can fall off).<o:p></o:p></span></p></li><li><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"">Durability:
Crater Creeper is a solid set that won’t easily fall apart, which makes it good
if the buyer wants to play with it. The legs have a little give to them but, at
least for me, haven’t popped off or become loose.<o:p></o:p></span></p></li><li><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"">Pincers:
The Crater Creeper’s primary weapon is its huge set of front pincers. The
pincers open by pulling back on two technic pieces, and will snap back together
with the help of a small rubber band. When closed the pincers are strong enough
to hold up Chuck Stonebreaker and his small hovercraft/speeder.<o:p></o:p></span></p></li><li><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;""></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"">Storage:
One thing that often bothers me is the lack of storage space for character
accessories on smaller Lego sets. Fortunately the Crater Creeper has a small
attachment to hold the Buggoid’s blaster at the back underneath a transparent
red piece.<o:p></o:p></span></p></li><li><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;""></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"">Galaxy
Squad Vehicle: This set includes a small hovercraft/speeder for Chuck
Stonebreaker to fly. While small, this vehicle has a unique circular design
that I haven’t seen in many other sets. It also has two flick missiles and
holders for Stonebreaker’s two blasters.<o:p></o:p></span></p></li></ul>

<ul><li><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"">Legs:
The legs on the Crater Creeper were a bit disappointing. Nearly half of each
leg is a single black piece that looks cool but takes away some building
experience. These large pieces are also responsible for the give in the legs
that I mentioned earlier. The middle legs on each side move but only
vertically. Lego obviously wanted to give the legs a bit of functionality, but
having two legs move up and down doesn’t really do the job.<o:p></o:p></span></p></li><li><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"">Pilot
Controls: The Crater Creeper only has one small control panel in the cockpit.
The panel required putting a small sticker on a small slanted brick, which can
be annoying if you don’t like using stickers. While it’s nifty looking, I wish
there was something a little more substantial.</span></p></li></ul><div><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;""><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,&quot;serif&quot;"">As
I said earlier, I was more impressed by this set than I’d expected. It’s an
economical addition to the bug army, and I recommend it to any Galaxy Squad
fan.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"TheFadedTBCap","2013-12-27T13:08:45.337Z","Solid Set From a Great Theme","This is a great addition to the Galaxy Squad theme. &nbsp;It is a good size for the money and comes with some good sideways building elements. &nbsp;The pincer is simple but works great and is a fun weapon to use. &nbsp;The insect machine also comes with two flick-fire missiles behind and above the cockpit which adds another feature to the model. &nbsp;Sadly, the Creeper lacks move-ability since the front and back legs are lock into fixed positions due to technic elements and the middle legs just loosely move up and down. &nbsp;The hovercraft for the Green Galaxy Squad Team is an awesome little spacecraft. &nbsp;The overall shape of this little craft is nicely done with a cool cockpit with the engine in the back and the controls in the front. &nbsp;Attached next to the driver are two flick-fire missiles so that he can fight back against this dangerous beast. &nbsp;The minifigures are top-notch with amazing detailing. The spaceman is primarily green and grey, starting with his legs which are green pants with grey knee guards. &nbsp;His torso is double-sided with grey armored plating on the front with a black belt and more armor and what appears to be a breathing system on the back. &nbsp;He has green sleeves with black gloves (no arm printing). &nbsp;His head is double-sided with a tan beard with battle scars on one side and a breathing mask on the other. &nbsp;To complete the look, he wears a green space helmet with a clear visor. &nbsp; The bug is well designed too. &nbsp;His legs are an off-green color and are decorated with burgundy to give the feeling of a strong exoskeleton. &nbsp;This continues through his double-sided torso, which is detailed with strong plating. &nbsp;His head is awesome with four compound eyes, four fangs, and over-lapping exoskeleton layers that continue over his back. &nbsp;The minifigures come with their own weapons which connect to their respective vehicles (the spaceman's two guns attach to become extra blasters and the Buggoid's blaster connects to the back to make a stinger).<div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div>Bug vehicle is good sized</div><div>Snapping pincers work well</div><div>Model is sturdy</div><div>Insect machine has two flick-fire missiles</div><div>Awesome hovercraft comes with two flick-fire missiles</div><div>Minifigures are fantastic</div><div>Comes with two space guns and an alien blaster</div><div>Weapons attach to their respective vehicles</div><div><br></div><div>Cons:</div><div>Alien model lacks maneuverability</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, it is a nice model. &nbsp;I give it a 8/10. &nbsp;It is a good set for the money and I recommend it to all Galaxy Squad fans.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,3,4
"exorallan31","2022-10-06T19:01:09.02Z","Pretty solid set overall!","<p>Haven&#39;t reviewed a galaxy squad set yet. Thought i would do this next.</p>

<p>There are some fun pieces, a pistol, some black hero factory weapons used for the legs, printed lime tile, Trans red windscreen.</p>

<p>For the minifigures we have a buggoid and chuck stonebreaker.</p>

<p>The buggoid has a really nice moulded head and some solid leg and torso prints.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chuck has a nice head print, rest not so exiting.</p>

<p>Putting this thing together was pretty fun, took about 20 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The models are the crater creeper and the hovercraft.</p>

<p>The hovercraft is a nice little thing with some holders for his pistols and flick missiles. only thing i don&#39;t like here is the gold studs.</p>

<p>The creeper is very big for its amount of parts and looks good.</p>

<p>it has a grabbing function on the front that works pretty well and can easily hold the hovercraft! and some flick missiles. Legs in the middle can move, not much else really.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PPP For the set is not perfect, but there is some play value here. looks solid for display too.</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s just a good set!&nbsp;</p>
