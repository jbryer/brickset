<p>It weighs in at 440 pieces for &pound;35 / US$40 and consists of a mech, two bugs, a orange Galaxy Squad trooper that BrickLink calls &#39;Jack Fireblade&#39;, and his robotic sidekick.</p>

<p>So, alien&nbsp;bugs and a mech, what&#39;s not to like...</p>

<h2>Box and contents</h2>

<p>As usual, the back of the box shows the movement and play features of the set which, in this case, are significant. More on them later...</p>

<p>The QR code currently leads nowhere. I guess the purpose of it is so you can see the set in action while in the shop. Good luck getting a signal in Toys R Us though...</p>

<p>Three numbered bags, two instruction books and just the one sticker sheet in this set. Bag one builds the bugs, bag two&nbsp;the&nbsp;top&nbsp;of the mech, bag three its legs and arms.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Jack Fireblade and his robotic sidekick, both of whom have appeared in earlier sets. Unfortunately there are no alien minifigs in this set and that is a criticism of the Galaxy Squad series: there are too few bugs -- how is one expected to build a swarm of them?</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9006661658/"" title=""70707 CLS-89 Eradicator Mech by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""70707 CLS-89 Eradicator Mech"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7391/9006661658_d85eb782c4.jpg"" style=""height:331px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>The robot is excellent, with a new armour piece and wings that clip to it. I believe of the four Galaxy Squad factions (red, green, blue and orange) it&#39;s only the orange one that has these pieces.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9005482013/"" title=""70707 CLS-89 Eradicator Mech by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""70707 CLS-89 Eradicator Mech"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7406/9005482013_71d981ab88.jpg"" style=""height:331px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<h2>The bugs</h2>

<p>There are&nbsp;two bugs,&nbsp;designed to appear to be from the same genus, but one is winged. Both feature the cool new bulbous pieces used for the&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaster"">gaster</a>. If you don&#39;t know already, you&#39;ll see what they are good for later :-)</p>

<p>Why, though, do they only have four legs? I know they are alien and thus don&#39;t necessarily follow the same evolutionary rules as on Earth, but I think they&#39;d look so much better with 6 legs, for the sake of eight more pieces. They have a tendency to collapse when you touch them so an additional two legs would help prevent this. I made the same observation when I reviewed <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/news/article/?ID=5747"">70700 Space Swarmer</a>.</p>

<h2>The mech</h2>

<p>The orange and white mech stands about 20cm tall. It makes a lot of use of the new right-angle brackets to implement SNOT techniques on much of the model.</p>

<p>The hips swivel, the legs are jointed at the hips and ankle, and the arms at the shoulder. That&#39;s a good range of movement, but it could be better, and usually is when AFOLs build mechs.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9006656824/"" title=""70707 CLS-89 Eradicator Mech by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""70707 CLS-89 Eradicator Mech"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5452/9006656824_f26ba8ba0a.jpg"" style=""height:500px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>A view of the back. Note the flick-fire missiles on the right arm. The slightly strange looking 2x2 round bricks on the backs of the legs are to prevent it topping backwards.</p>

<p>What on earth is the robot doing upside down on the back, I hear you ask? Read on to find out...</p>

<p>The cockpit can be removed and swooshed around.</p>

<p>It has thrusters at the back and a small, what I think is a bomb-bay with a hinged door. More flick-fire missiles grace the wings.</p>

<p>With the cockpit removed the mech looks like this...</p>

<p>The back is hinged, so after it&#39;s been turned 90 degrees down...</p>

<p>... and rotated, the robot is now piloting the mech! How clever is that! The back of the box calls this the &#39;Mech Exosuit&#39; and the cockpit bit &#39;Galaxy Jet&#39;.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>The transforming nature of the mech is a very clever feature that adds a lot of playability to the set. Also, as I&#39;m sure you know or have worked out, the squaddie can be inserted into the gaster and left to&nbsp;be digested&nbsp;in the bugs juices (or something like that...)</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9006664638/"" title=""70707 CLS-89 Eradicator Mech by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""70707 CLS-89 Eradicator Mech"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3806/9006664638_a043638d7c.jpg"" style=""height:331px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>It was an interesting set to build, particularly as I wasn&#39;t aware of the transforming feature. On several occasions I wondered what the subassembly was that&nbsp;I was building and how it was going to fit onto the model (sorry if I&#39;ve spoiled that surprise for you)</p>

<p>So, two great looking bugs and an interesting mech, what&#39;s not to like? Well, a couple of things actually, the bugs really should have six legs and one or two alien minifigs would have been nice. Other than that it&#39;s a top set.</p>

<p>Scores, out of 5:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Parts: 5 -- a very good selection of useful parts. Nothing unique, but a lot in new or rare colours.</li>
	<li>Playability: 5 -- there&#39;s a lot of fun to be had with this set</li>
	<li>Building experience: 4 -- not challenging, but very interesting</li>
	<li>Value for money: 4 -- I thought it&#39;s pretty good value for what&#39;s in it and the playability it provides. There&#39;s more to &#39;value for money&#39; than the price per piece...</li>
	<li>Overall:&nbsp;4.5 -- An extra 4 legs would have made it a 5.</li>

This set, like the Swarm Interceptor, has that classic feel to it; while the Swarm Interceptor was a classic in that it reminded me of a sleeker version of a Classic Space set, this invokes the feel of Exo-Force, one of my favorite themes in Lego. This mech also has a lot going for it in the playability department. Read on to find out why this set stands out to me:&nbsp;</p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The split function on the mech actually came as a big surprise to me when I began reading reviews about this set, and it works a real charm; it looks very good in either formation, which is something I thought would have been difficult to pull off. <br></li><li>This is a beautiful set for playability; the two bugs are very well-designed, different enough to create variety, the pods used to trap minifigures, the multitude of weapons on the ship, the split function- this is a set meant for kids to play with. <br></li><li>The mech has a wonderful color scheme; that orange is very pretty and bright, and has a fair amount of orange; compared to other sets, there is plenty of orange in here, and it just looks stupendous. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The stickers are back! There are 13 of them in here, and are rather tricky to put on. They make the set look wonderful, but they are rather small and somewhat insignificant. (I accidentally forgot to put one of them on... oops!)</li><li>The mech, due to its large size, is difficult to put in the right position with its shorter legs. Although the ""barrels"" in the back do help with posing, it is still difficult to put it in many a pose<br></li><li>Also, I find that the bugs need a few more legs on them; it would help with stability a lot, and would make the bugs feel more... buggy, in my opinion. They would just feel more alien to me, I guess. <br></li></ul>
<p>This is a wonderful set, chock full of playability, an excellent price-to piece ratio, and some really great designs. It looks just superb to me, and will be a hit with many kids and adults. I highly recommend this fantastic set to anyone who likes mechs, Space lines, or Lego in general. This is just a great set all around. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"imnewhere","2014-01-12T16:20:24.027Z","Team Orange for the Win!","<p>I just got this on a whim with some other sets, but Lego included a free Chima set with it, so that was cool. But anyway, moving forth.</p>

<h3>Parts-</h3>

<p>There are a number of good parts for MOC making, including wings, hinges, slopes, cockpits, and more. Most parts are in white, orange or green, but dark red Exo-Force arms make an appearance as well.</p>

<h3>The Completed&nbsp;Model-</h3>

<p>The set as a whole is great. 2 bugs on 1 big mech seems like a fair fight, and I appreciate that they didn&#39;t give us 2 identical bugs. The firing arm on the mech works great, and the fact that the little jet can fly off and the mech&nbsp;can transform into a different mech is sweet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion-</h3>

<p>Great set if you&#39;ve got 40 bucks burning a whole in your pocket,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;for mech&nbsp;MOC&nbsp;making.</p>

"jackybrick","2014-05-18T19:44:49.75Z","Space disinfestation ","<p>The Galaxy Squad sets got my interest last year, because of their nice vehicle design, cool&nbsp;colour scheme, and great looking minifigs. And I have to say, that I was glad to see some new&nbsp;sci-fi&nbsp;LEGO products not related to the Star Wars theme too.</p>

<p>Now, I have a nice collection of these GS sets at home, but this is the one, that started it all... &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a medium-sized box (it&#39;s a bit smaller than usual, as it is matter of all 2013 boxes), wherein you&#39;ll find one sticker sheet, two instruction booklets and three numbered bags of parts. Personally I find the front boxart really nice, but the back of the&nbsp;box is maybe even more interesting as it shows all the functions and play features of this set (and there are many of them, tell you that). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are rather easy to follow and I didn&#39;t noticed any unidentifiable drawings or colours. At the end of the booklets, there are some adverts for another Galaxy Squad products, the Galaxy Squad website, as well as the coming-soon advert for the 2014 Ninjago product line. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>440 pieces is enough for me, in this price range. I haven&#39;t noticed any new moulds, but a lot of parts in new or rare colours (for example, green cocoon parts are exclusive to this set ). Of course you get few tiny extra pieces as usual.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs are sooooo nice! I really like that GS outfits and helmets, and these orange ones are just superb. The robot sidekick is great and has a cool&nbsp;armour-piece, with a wings that can &#39;clip&#39; onto it &nbsp;from it&#39;s backside. His torso and legs are similar, at the first sight, to Jack Fireblade&#39;s&nbsp;ones but they are not the same and that&#39;s nice.</p>

<p>It is true, that this is the only GS set without any buggoid&nbsp;minifig (except for the polybags), but the fact that you get two different brick-built bugs, that are not even meant to be piloted by a buggoid (altough it is possible to place a&nbsp;minifig on their back) compensate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very enjoyable, full of surprises, especially when you are building the split/convert mechanism. It was a joy, seeing as my CLS-89 Eradicator Mech&nbsp;was taking it&#39;s final shape through my&nbsp;building proceed - it was only spoiled little bit by applying a lot of stickers, but it was worth it, though, as they really add to the mech&#39;s design and detail. &nbsp;In the end, this set took me longer to build than I expected. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great design, a lot of features, fun to play with, nice colour scheme, that&#39;s it!</p>

<p>Many people complain about the four legged bugs- personally, this doesn&#39;t bother me in the case of design (from this point of view, I actually like it), but it is true, that the weight of those bugs is actually a bit heavy for only four legs, so you&#39;ll have to find some good position for them to stand properly and to do not descend.</p>

<p>I only really wish this set to have a little bit of a terrain, plant , structure or something to indicate the environment of some distant planet, where this GS&nbsp;vs. buggoids battle takes place.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A really, really nice example of a medium-sized, space-themed set, I would recommend it to any LEGO fan. It doesn&#39;t deserve to be used just as a parts-pack and it won&#39;t disappoint you.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>- play features</p>

<p>- enjoyable building&nbsp;</p>

<p>- colour scheme</p>

<p>- minifigs</p>

<p>- nice LEGO pieces</p>

<p>- design</p>

<p>- cocoons (in the case, you haven&#39;t noticed: you get here two of both- smaller and bigger cocoon &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pieces- so you can build a large green cocoon along with a little green buggoid&nbsp;egg, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; instead of those two medium-sized ones shown in pictures)</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<p>- could have a bad guy minifig</p>

<p>- some little additional structure or whatever would be great</p>

<p>- the bugs are too heavy for just a four legs to stand properly, sometimes</p>

<p>- only one sticker sheet (I would be grateful if LEGO Group started adding an extra sticker &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;sheet to all sets, in the case you mess the first one up)&nbsp;</p>
