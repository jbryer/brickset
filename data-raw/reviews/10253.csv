"dcmal","2013-12-08T21:53:38.78Z","The pinnacle set for Galaxy Squad: In the spirit of Classic Space?","<p>In my perception, Galaxy Squad is the first Lego theme following the footsteps of Classic Lego Space since 1999. Since 1999, Lego Space themes acquired a strangely close relation to either actual space exploration (Mission to Mars, Mars Mission, Space Port) and/or the Lego City theme (Alien Conquest, which isn&#39;t set in space, and Space Police III, which is a caricature of highway robbery, limousines and pimp-my-ride in space). The only exceptions would be #10191 Star Justice and #10192 Space Skulls (both 2008). Presumably, Lego did not want to create internal competition to its Star Wars product line.</p>

<p>The last proper Space theme before the arrival of Lego Star Wars was Insectoids, and with an insectoid sub-theme, Galaxy Squad picks up where that left off: it is as far away from current space exploration and Lego City as Futuron ever was, and many of the vehicles would fit right into 80&#39;s Lego Space - especially the small ones from 70702 Warp Stinger and 70706 Crater Creeper. The coloured uniforms - Blue, Red, Orange and Green - of the four eponymous squads are as reminiscent of the Lego Space uniform scheme of old as it can possibly get.</p>

<p><strong>The Galactic Titan</strong></p>

<p>The Galactic Titan is the largest of the Galaxy Squad sets. It includes five minifigures and three models - or four, because the Galactic Titan can easily count as two.</p>

<p>The aliens have a Hive Tower base, consisting of a short spire hiding a simple mechanism to lob a pinkish alien egg holding an alien larva. Two short bridges lead to a clasp for an alien cocoon (with a Galaxy Squad team member inside, if it was up to the aliens), and to what the description calls a &quot;weapons rack&quot;: a few bricks with a crystal, and a grip for a sidearm. The Creepy Centipede is really a Hexadecipede with frontal maw and rear attachment point for an alien pod. A Winged Mosquito and a Mantizoid act as crew for this detachment. The former is fairly common, but the latter can only be found in one other set. They are supported by the previously mentioned insectoid larvae. The Winged Mosquito is equipped with a common blaster, the Mantizoid sports two melee weapons with ragged edges.</p>

<p>Subsequently, the alien insects are woefully underequipped to deal with a Blue team arriving in full force: Solomon Blaze, Max Solarflare, and their robot sidekick. The robot and Solomon appear in two other sets each, but Max is exclusive to this set. The ubiquitous Blue Team has members in three other sets. According to Galaxy Squad lore, it is the strategy and technology group with the best tech, as is proven by their mighty Galactic Titan.</p>

<p>The Galactic Titan really consists of two vehicles: a land-based tracked vehicle, and a flying attack craft. Lego&#39;s descriptive texts are a bit hazy on this point, but apparently the tank goes under the name Planetary Defender, while the flying attack craft is the Deep Space Destroyer. The combination of the two is called Galactic Titan.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The Galactic Titan set comes in a large box which is filled 60-70% with seven numbered and one unnumbered bags full of bricks. Two large booklets and a sticker sheet are packed in a separate ninth bag which features a cardboard stiffener to prevent the booklets from crumbling.</p>

<p>The build process starts with the alien base and Creepy Caterpillar. Both the Hive Tower and the Creepy Caterpillar are very conventional and straightforward builds. Noteworthy is merely that attaching the caterpillar&#39;s sixteen legs is slightly tedious, but about halfway through the first booklet, all alien models have been built.</p>

<p>The rest of the manual instructs on the assembly of Blue Team&#39;s equipment. First is the tracked vehicle, the Planetary Defender. It starts as a very conservative chassis on the basis of technic beams, which makes out the majority of the vehicle. It&#39;s mostly function, and little form: A few stud-not-on-top (SNOT) techniques are used, but those are mostly for decoration, except some at the rear, which are tasked with giving the vehicle vertical stability. This is important because the Deep Space Destroyer will later be attached via four tight-clutching hinge elements so that the Planetary Defender needs to hold together firmly when separating the Deep Space Destroyer. Anyway, after it&#39;s been finished, the Planetary Defender serves not only as ground transport and launcher for its payload, but also sport two spring-operated missiles on a retractable rotating turret with its own extendable radar dish. The vehicle runs on four tracks attached to twelve wheels, but despite its considerable size can only seat one Blue Team member.</p>

<p>In any way, by the time the Planetary Defender has been completed, the builder will be well into the second booklet and all that remains is building the Deep Space Destroyer.&nbsp; This, too, is a conservative build with SNOT mostly applied for decorative reasons, and a little to strengthen the fuselage for the stress of splitting it off its carrier vehicle. It is an effective build, again with ample use of technic parts, but nothing too fancy.</p>

<p>All in all, even a seasoned builder should be busy for two to three hours building this set. Both Blue Squad vehicles come with few printed parts. Aside from minifigure torsos, no parts bear a Galaxy-Squad specific print. Instead, the set comes with a number of stickers. Most are straightforward to attach, but some go on bent and round parts and are tricky to get right. There are a few clever stickers, particularly the squished insects on the windscreen, the HUD displays (a first in Lego?), and the victory icons on the side of the Deep Space Destroyer.</p>

<p><strong>The bricks</strong></p>

<p>The set comes with one orange brick separator. Besides the Galaxy-Squad trademark parts (cocoon halves, insectoid, etc.), it contains a few parts which are colour-unique to this set at the time of writing: there are yellow 1x2 plates with hinge, lime-green attic bricks with slope, lime-green 2x4 hinge plates, dark azure 1x2 slopes, earth blue rims, and more. None of these are particularly exciting, in my opinion. I found some other bricks more spectacular, among them the trans-clear windscreens, and two black 5x5 angled Technic beams, which are only available in five sets. There is also a 3x6x10 shell with worming, which is more commonly known for its use in cement mixer sets from the City range. It&#39;s curious that this part was used because the worming is not necessary. The identically sized part from #3368 Space Centre without worming seems to be a more logical choice, but was not used.</p>

<p>Other than that, the parts are fairly standard. The colour choice for some bricks is a bit clownish because Galaxy Squad&#39;s colour template is not always adhered to. This is particularly obvious when looking at the Deep Space Defender from behind. Nonetheless, it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to have fun with the parts of this set and construct your own models.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model and playability</strong></p>

<p>The completed Galactic Titan is quite impressive. The combination of Planetary Defender and Deep Space Destroyer are a sight to behold, although it&#39;s not obvious what direction is forward. The proportions work nicely. The spacecraft is, however, very firmly attached to the carrier vehicle. It took a few moments before I found out how to separate them easily. (Hint: lift under the Destroyer&#39;s engines.)</p>

<p>Separated, the Planetary Defender still looks badass, mainly due to its now unshapely proportions and the dual launchers rising from the chassis. The Deep Space Destroyer looks neat as well, as long as you don&#39;t look at it from the rear. Its look&nbsp;has something of a streamlined Republic Attack Shuttle from Star Wars due to its in-line cockpit and angled wings. To access the cockpit seating two, the canopy has to be taken off. Unfortunately, there is no additional compartment and a lot of space under the wings goes unused. There are two flick missiles in the landing gear, which wobbles due to its simple construction of technic poles. The wings are movable, but rather than sweep, they rotate, which looks silly in motion - it&#39;s not clear why they do that.</p>

<p>I have little love for the alien Creepy Caterpillar and Hive Tower. From all alien Galaxy Squad models, these seem to be the most uninspired. I have to give the designer credit for leaving trodden paths and not just make another fly-bug model, as was done in most of the other Galaxy Squad sets. Ball-and-socket joints instead of hinges might have made the caterpillar more interesting as it would have been able to slither across any topology then.</p>

<p>Playability and swooshability of the set as a whole is not quite straightforward. Generally, it can be very fun. The caterpillar doesn&#39;t swoosh well. The Hive Tower has some inviting quality, but its larvae egg shooter is very limited: the egg goes up rather than forward. The Galactic Titan itself is solid. It has a nice heft to it and is a very stable platform for the two spring-loaded guns on the retractable turret. However, although the rubber tracks suggest tank-like all-terrain-capability, in reality it has the off-road characteristics of a race car: none whatsoever. Due to its very low ground clearance combined with a chassis protruding beyond the rubber tracks, even a minor bump in the surface, e.g. a small crease in the carpet, stops the Galactic Titan dead in its tracks: The chassis hits the bump before the rubber track rolls on it. So, the Galactic Titan is only fun to move around on very even surfaces. Further, the track mounting bends due to stress on the technic beams holding the wheels.</p>

<p>The Deep Space Destroyer does not have such issues. Apart from a wobbly landing gear, it is stable and fun to swoosh around. It is a bit tricky to hold because there is no obvious handhold at the centre of gravity, so you end up holding it near the cockpit or on your fingertips. But because there are no parts which knock off easily, it will survive even extensive dogfights.</p>

<p>None of the Galaxy Squad sets combine with any other, and the Galactic Titan is no different. The Planetary Defender can&#39;t be utilised for transport because it has no floor. The Planetary Defender can&#39;t transport anything either, despite the empty space between its wings and landing gear, which really seems predestined for cargo. In fact, there is not even space for the robot sidekick&#39;s backpack and weapon, which he can&#39;t equip when sitting in the spacecraft. Luckily, the Planetary Defender sports clips to hold at least Solomon&#39;s and Max&#39;s weapons.</p>

<p><strong>The verdict</strong></p>

<p>The review started by pointing out that Galaxy Squad is a spiritual successor of Classic Lego Space. Since the Galactic Titan, being the biggest and heaviest set and model, is the pinnacle of all Galaxy Squad vehicles, it follows in the footsteps of not one, but four Lego Space traditions: In addition to having a big high-end set for each subtheme (often a base or a flagship), Lego Space has traditionally also featured...</p>

<ul>
	<li>... a good number of land-based launcher vehicles for manned spacecraft: #6870 Space Probe Launcher (1981) was the first, but has many siblings: #6871 Star Patrol Launcher (1984), #6874 Moon Rover (1986), 6925 Interplanetary Rover (1988), ... there are many more, but you get the point: launch vehicles have a tradition in Lego Space.</li>
	<li>... super-heavy vehicles, which are few, but usually highly acclaimed: #6950 Mobile Rocket Transport (1982) was the first of its class, #6989 Mega Core Magnetizer (1990) is the favourite set of many an AFOL. 7699 MT-101 Armoured Drilling Unit (2007) might have been slightly less praised, but the recent #7066 Earth Defense HQ (2011) received much praise.</li>
	<li>... the &quot;Galaxy/Galactic&quot; name: traditionally, &quot;Galaxy&quot; or &quot;Galactic&quot; has been an identifier of Lego Space pinnacle sets: #928 Galaxy Explorer (1977), 6980 Galaxy Commander (1983), #6984 Galactic Mediator (1992) and #5974 Galactic Enforcer (2009) have all topped off their respective subthemes and are fondly remembered. (No need to bring up #1462 Galactic Scout (1992)... )</li>
</ul>

<p>My point is: A Space-themed pinnacle set called &quot;Galactic Titan&quot; and featuring a super-heavy carrier vehicle - this is in good Lego Space tradition, yet innovative and new. But most of all, it comes with expectations. So,&nbsp;does the Galactic Titan deliver?</p>

<p>Although it&#39;s not particularly big when compared to other Space sets, it is a worthy pinnacle set for Galaxy Squad. Kids who get into Lego Space now might remember it fondly when they become AFOLs - if it wasn&#39;t for some contemporary sets from the Star Wars range easily being twice as big.</p>

<p>It is difficult to argue with success and focus group test-driven product design. Like all Galaxy Squad sets, the Galactic Titan seems to have been very single-mindedly designed around split-functions and action-play between Galaxy Squad and insect aliens. Personally, I would have liked to see a bit more &quot;play&quot;, and a bit less &quot;shooting&quot;. The Planetary Defender&#39;s spring-loaded guns are nice, but a larger crew compartment would have been nicer. Last year&#39;s #7066 Earth Defense HQ had a couple of good ideas how to fill space in a vehicle, particularly when aliens are involved. For example, as a kid I felt that the erector arm of the #6950 Mobile Rocket Transport was very useful for any kind of play, far beyond deploying a rocket: You could&nbsp;raise astronauts in it to repair the radar dish of #6970 Beta I Command Base, etc.&nbsp;Anyway, Astronauts could stand anywhere on the transport, not only in the (large) cockpit. The Galactic Titan offers nothing like that. The Planetary Defender&#39;s command cockpit is hard-pressed to take additional astronauts, and there simply is no space anywhere outside for minifigures to plausibly stand. Similar issues affect all Galaxy Squad sets.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t quite see the point of the alien models in the set. A sarcastic cynic might remark that due to its size, the Galactic Titan could just drive over and squish this opposition. It makes sense to include both fractions in smaller sets, but do sets at a price point of GBP 90.00 really need implausible opposition for the sake of it?</p>

<p>Having said that, I like the Galactic Titan despite its shortcomings. It fits very well into the Galaxy Squad theme, is certainly innovative as a giant launcher ground vehicle, brings enough interesting parts - and hey, it is a return to Lego Space, after all. Yes, definitely a worthy bearer of the affix &quot;Galactic&quot;.</p>

"Firox_5000","2013-12-26T20:56:42.857Z","Attack Of The Giant Titan ","The Galactic Titan is the largest set/vehicle of the Galaxy Squad theme which I received from family at christmas. Having become rather interested in the Galaxy Squad theme and also owning several sets, will this mighty beast score as greatly as it's scale?<div><br></div><div><b>The Box/packaging&nbsp;</b></div><div>The set's box comprises a rather large rectangular box where the contents lye a few inches away from the top once opened.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set comes with a total of seven bags, each numbered for the stage of the build. There's also an eighth bag which includes larger parts for the set such as the cockpit roof and treads.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Build</b></div><div>The building experience itself is a fairly long but simple build with an approximate duration of around 2 hours. The numbered bags divide the build in to a number of sub models with bag one building the alien centipede and compound whilst the remaining six construct the Titan itself.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are also 2 instruction manuals included.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>TheMini figures&nbsp;</b></div><div>There are five figures included, these are two blue space men, a blue mech droid, two aliens and a small insect creature.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first insect features a headpiece which resembles a fly face with its antennas and large checked black eyes. It also includes a set of lime green wings and also dark red printings on the torso slightly resembling a muscular chest. There's also printing on the legs and at the back Of the torso also resembling muscles. The toros piece included makes this figure unique to the set and different from similar figures included sets such as the Swarm Interceptor.</div><div><br></div><div>The second insect figure features a head with four eyes and red sharp teeth and green antennas attached to the head. There are also red printings at the centre of the torso as well as additional printing on the legs and back of the figure. This figure doesn't include wings but is also unique to the set due to the unique printing on the figure's torso.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The first space figure is from the blue squad and features a dual &nbsp;printed face where neutral and gear equipped expressions are located. This figure has orange facial hair, a telescope in one eye and head set microphone. This figure features green printing at the centre of the torso with a small number of printings of symbols plus additional printing at the back where there's a communication device with the number 30 and two small device printings on the legs too. Despite the leg and torso piece being the same as most blue squad figures, this one is unique to this set due to the facial expressions and hair printings.</div><div><br></div><div>The second blue squad figure feature a more simple printed face with no specific facial features except an eye telescope. This figure also features dual facial expressions including a neutral and pilot expressions. The blue uniform is exactly identical to other blue squad figures. Unlike the first three, this figure isn't unique and is included in other sets such as the Star Slicer.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The fifth figure is the blue mech droid who features a chrome like face with an orange and blue eye on the face plus white line patterns too. The figure's torso is different from the other blues quadrants due to more device printing instead of the muscular tones on the others plus an additional blue device printed at the back of he torso which is larger than those at the back of the other figures. The leg printing remains the same as other figures. This figure also includes a giant 7 piece bazooka and a jet pack which can be added and detached for when in the Titan. This figure isn't unique to the set as identical ones are included in atleast two other sets, one which is very cheap to buy.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Elements of the set</b></div><div>The elements of the model include the attack compound, alien centipede and the upper and lower levels of the tank which comprise the main element of the set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The attack compound is a small area for the aliens where tubes, standing platforms plus storage area for eggs are located. There is also a push fire function where eggs can be catapulted back by using a level at the back of the structure.</div><div><br></div><div>The alien centipede is a long trailing creature made of four sections attached &nbsp;to each other with the first section housing the 2nd alien figure with four sharp claws at the front. The middle sections are identical whilst the back section can have a cocoon pod attached at the back. The creature also has four legs on each section too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The lower section of the tank features a large command cell at the front (or the back when the upper section is attached) which can fit a figure. There's also a glass screen at the back of the centre too. There are 12 large wheels which drive the tank which are covered by four large rubber tracks which give the vehicle a more all Terran look. The most impressive feature here though is the hidden dual cannon shooter which lifts from the middle of the tank. Both missiles can be fired simultaneously and the turret can be rotated 360 degrees making it very helpful for role play usage. There's also a lifting radar as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The upper section of the Titan uses a giant clear piece for the cockpit which clicks in and out of the place. Two figures can sit comfortably here with the room at the driving controls as well as a control panel which can be raised and lowered. The back of the section features a giant cement mixer piece replicating a large engine for the Titan as well as speed propellers at the back too, there are also two wings which can be rotated around 100 degrees to pose for flight during display and role play which can be done fairly easily. Additional features include flick fire missiles and countless number of details on the side which are achieved by stickers.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Conclusion&nbsp;</b></div><div>Overall this is big large set filled with a high number of features. This set is very good for displaying in any space collection and the many functions such as the dual fire missiles, catapulting eggs and detaching jet make this set very good for role play, however perhaps another figure and small vehicle could've been included to make the playability top marks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Also, there needs to be a place to store the weapons when the figures are inside the Titan as there is currently nowhere to store the mech's jet pack. A good place could've been the behind of the lower tank as an empty space currently lies there. For £80, the set is slightly overpriced, so a £70 price point would &nbsp;set a more reasonable price point.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would recommend this set to anyone who likes Lego space, giant tanks, play functions and fans of aliens and sci-fi.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The set is currently on sale on Lego-Shop and despite only being out 5-6 months is likely to discontinue if you wish to buy this set and also at a decent reduction price, this will probably be a good idea.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,3
"Faefrost","2014-07-28T05:47:59.39Z","Prepare for Ground Assault","<p>A very good very solid Space set. The crown jewel of the Galaxy Squad line. The Blue Team&#39;s awesome Galactic Titan. It really is an impressive looking beast. Something that goes well with both modern space, Classic Space thanks to it&#39;s blue livery, or even amazingly Star Wars. This set has a similar feel to the Clone Turbo Tank and looks great when populated out with blue trimmed 501st Clone Troopers and Captain Rex or operating on some frozen planet like Hoth or Ilum in the time of the Old Republic. Staffed with those Sith Troopers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main selling point of the set is the Titan itself. Those huge tracks. The splitting vehicle that becomes a ground assault missile battery and an attack gunship. It&#39;s great. Not perfect but still incredibly fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Insect Alien portions of this set are quite frankly a little better than most others in the line. It just has a somewhat darker creepier feel with the egg towers and walkways and the creepy centipede vehicle. Not as absurd or cartoony as the usual flying mosquito ships and such. Plus it includes those great flying larval bugs that hatch out of the pink eggs.</p>

<p>The build is fairly standard for a modern set. Relying heavily on a lot of technic builds and reinforcement which make it seem a bit skeletal in places. The tracks and treads look fantastic. If only they moved that well. It uses the giant rubber band style treads which really need a lot of friction such as from a carpet to move well. Not so much on a wood floor. The wheels themselves look amazing using R5 Droid head pieces to really add some detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicle has a sort of &quot;push me pull you&quot; approach to design. When all together there is a small ground vehicle cockpit facing one way, and the huge curved cockpit of the flying gunship facing the other. Once the gunship is undocked a spring missile battery fold upwards from underneath iton technic liftarms. The Gunship is a great looking design having a very modern feel to it. Like something that just stepped out of a movie or video game. Very swooshable. It has flick fires. Neither model has any usable interior space or play areas beyond their respective cockpits. Most of the Gunship is made from the Lego City Cement Mixer Barrels. It looks great but it is kind of a shame that it could not be used as a troop carrier or drop ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs are 2 blue team humans. One male and one female. The Blue Team robot, a typical Mosquito Alien and a newer Mantis type Alien plus 2 of the alien larvae bugs (which are adorable). As I said the Alien stuff in this set has a more creepy and sinister feel to it than much of the rest of the line. I wish more of it was like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a very very good set. A great set if you can find it on discount.&nbsp;</p>

"Moriboe","2022-10-22T20:25:56.34Z","Size for size's sake","<p>This is the Galaxy Squad theme&#39;s&nbsp;flagship, so the brief for this one probably was: make it big! Unfortunately that&#39;s about the only box it ticks.</p>

<p>The ground vehicle without the flyer looks unfinished. Despite its size there is no interior space, instead containing a dual cannon that can pop out of its centre. The flyer is just awkward: it&#39;s top-heavy and the wings are too small for its mass. The centre feels like wasted space for this one too, comprised of half a concrete mixer. It kinda looks like a dropship, but it has no such function. In fact, it cannot do anything other than slightly altering the look of its wings by rotating. If only they were larger it would have been a cool feature. Putting the two together you get a blob with a cockpit on either end. The added details&nbsp;can&#39;t hide the boring construction underneath. Summed up the design work feels lazy, and the vehicle is lacking in function.<br />
<br />
But there&#39;s more: the insect base! This one&#39;s quite sinister, having a tube to extra juices from cocooned marines to feed the insect spawn inside the egg on the tower. It can hold figure for target practice. I rather like it. The centipede is cool too, being of an ideal size to be run over by the main vehicle,&nbsp;though the movement of the rubber tracks is too stiff to properly do this.<br />
<br />
For the original price I would not recommend this. Functionality and play features are lacking for a set this size. I find it rather ugly, too. When buying second hand, beware of the transparent stickers!</p>
