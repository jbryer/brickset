Here's the breakdown of the model and build.</p><p><strong>Racecar</strong>: This is the best part of the set. Even though it is a simple build it is this element that gives it character. The design is reminiscent of older formula one cars from 10-20 years ago. The playability factor and the ease of creating duplicates adds another level to the cars appeal. The only slight faults are the stickers and that the rear tires are the same width as the front tires.</p><p><strong>Truck</strong>: The truck is nearly identical to every other truck LEGO has produced with only slight modifications. The changes I like best are the use of the cheese wedges on the front to create a lower ""spoiler"" and the use of the ""s"" shaped pieces for the chassis. My only gripes with the cab are the use of stickers and no smoke stack(s).</p><p><strong>Trailer</strong>: This is where the set falters. The best part of the trailer is its color. I love having all the green pieces. Outside of that there isn't much good to say about it. Where oh where do I begin&nbsp;with the rest. Lets begin with the size. The length is great but the width just looks awkward. The entire trailer should have been made 8 studs wide instead of a mixture of 8 and 6 studs. Next, the ramp for the car is utterly useless and doesn't meld nicely with the top of the trailer. Third, the storage area has nothing in it. There aren't any monitors, tool rack( there is a tool box but it is separate from the trailer), spare car parts, nothing at all. Forth, there is no stand to hold the trailer up when it is detached from the cab. Fifth, the open holes in the bottom need to be plugged up. All it would take is for a competitor to climb in through the bottom and sabotage the&nbsp;Octan team.&nbsp;Lastly, the pin used to hold the trailer onto the cab is the wrong style. The trailer does not lock into the cab and therefor I can see lots of kids dropping one part or the other when they go to pick up the model.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Mini figs are great though redundant</li><li>Lots of green</li><li>Fun car</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The trailer</li><li>The trailer</li><li>Stickers galore</li><li>Same size tires on the race car</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: This is a great set for kids who would like to add a nice race car to their collection but when all is said and done only&nbsp;two of the three parts are worth it. This set is mediocre at best.</p>

"Steamrunner","2013-10-21T08:23:19.33Z","Looks great on the box, but poor in reality","<p>As a Formula One fan, I was keen to pick this up for a desk ornament; having just finished building it, all I can say is ""What a let-down"".</p><p>The car itself is OK; given the small scale the detail is fine. There is one oddity - the trans red 2x1 brick in front of the rear wheels - not entirely sure what that's meant to be for, but it's a simple swap-out to fix.</p><p>The truck, however, is surprisingly bad. The most obvious fault is that the rear ramp is useless - you can't roll the car up and into the truck with it, so why is it there at all? Plus, although the set comes with lots of tools, there's minimal storage - one or two fit in the tool drawers, but there's nowhere to store the rest (or, indeed, the drawers themselves). There's also 2 holes in the base - 2x2 - which seems odd.</p><p>Overall, this is a set which looks nice on the box, but doesn't work well once built. On the plus side, fixing the faults is a ncie exercise on modding, so there's that I guess...</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Car looks great</li><li>Truck cab, likewise, is pretty smart</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Trailer is a mess</li></ul>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,3
"Legobuilderguy","2014-03-19T12:45:40.697Z","Rather interesting","<p>I picked this set up because it was on sale at Target. I am not really a fan of the race themed sets but this set has some good parts and at 45% off it was a deal!</p>

<p>I did put this together to see what it actually looked like before parting it out and have to agree with the previous reviewers in that the trailer going from 6 studs to 8 studs is bit odd looking. I could see it looking better if you used the small slopes to make it more aerodynamic looking.</p>

<p>The truck cab is the winner of this set however as it looks pretty nice with the Octan color scheme of green/red/white so I think I may leave it together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The little F1 race car is kinda nice as well if you are into the racing theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest problem with this set as I can see it is it comes with three mini figures but the whole truck has seating for just one. Now of course you can just put the race car driver in the racer and store it in the truck. But where is the third guy supposed to sit? I think if they had made the trailer taller buy a brick the little storage area up front could have been made into a sitting area maybe with a TV screen so it could be used to monitor the race.</p>

"Bert_the_heavy_haular","2013-12-29T15:22:07.917Z","Goodish set ","<p>As a massive fan of F1 this was a set I really wanted. I wanted to review this set to give Parent a better view on how there children might like it not Just adults who had previously reviewed it.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Race car</strong> - This is my favriote part of the set. It looks very realistic and is a very good size ( much better that the ones from 2004). I like it's overall look. Even though it does have the wrong shaped tyres and the rear wing is not very realistic It looks good. The playability is good as it is quite solid and won't break as soon as you role it into a chair or table. </p><p><strong>Truck</strong> - I find the truck Ok but not Brilliant. It is very similar to most of the city&nbsp;trucks But does have the different front spoiler. However I think this makes it look worse. Also it is a bit short for my liking</p><p><strong>Trailer</strong> - This is the worst part&nbsp;of the set. I find the fact that it is half 6 studs and half 8 studs annoying. And the ramp does damage the playability. The wholes in the trailer look stupid. If this was better I would make this set 4 or even 5 stars but this ruins it. However I find the storage problem Ok.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>good small car </li><li>Good addition to your city</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Trailer is one of the worst mistakes of 2013 </li><li>No space for racing driver in truck. So must go in trailer with car. </li><li>Could have been cheaper </li></ul><p><br></p><p>In conclusion I would not recommend it for anyone over 12. In my opinion it is meant for younger children who don't care about how realistic it looks. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,3
