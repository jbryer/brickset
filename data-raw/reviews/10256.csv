There is also a jump, but is pretty gimmicky. The monster truck looks excellent and is well designed. The semi is very nice as well, but for the size and scale of it, the wheels seem very tiny. The trailer is the biggest flaw and looks as if it is an afterthought in this set. The overall look and design is poor and where the trailer connects to the semi, it is weak. &nbsp;Everything on the monster truck and the semi seems polished and clean, but the trailer has a lot of rough edges and does not match the rest of the set very well.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great monster truck, excellent design</li><li>Semi truck looks good and is well designed</li><li>Good overall look to the set when displayed</li><li>Top marks for playability</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Trailer design is poor and does not look finished like the rest of the set</li><li>Wheels look too small for the size of the semi</li><li>Jump is a bit of a gimmick and is not necessary</li></ul>
<p>Based on the monster truck alone, I do recommend this set, it really makes it worthwhile if you can look past the trailer.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,3
