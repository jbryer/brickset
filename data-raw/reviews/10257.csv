"MaartenRF10","2013-10-03T16:57:52.03Z","Tree House is probably most enjoyed by children","<b>Looks</b><br>Let's start with the looks. When I think of a tree house, I think of a tree. In that tree there's a small wooden structure built by a kids parent to play in. This Lego Tree House is not quiet like that. It's actually a house in a tree. The house is white, has actual windows and even roof tiles. I love tree houses, but this is not what I'd call a tree house.<br><br><b>Building</b><br>Building the main structure is rather enjoyable. It consist of a tree and a house, giving you two different things to build. There's some nice building techniques like the drop-down ladder. The other two buildings options of this set have less to offer. Especially the ""easy-building"" structure is very boring. It's mostly just putting a lot of small tiles on the ground plate...The ""medium-building"" has some foundations and a funny kitchen with an oven to put the pizza in.<br><br><b>Playing</b><br>This set is really made to play with. There's several things that can move. A ladder that can be let down and pulled up, a bucket on a rope, a little car for the minifig to pull, and movable branch to hide the treasure map beneath. <br>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>High playability<br></li><li>Lots of moving parts<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It's a house in a tree, not a tree house<br></li></ul>
<p>A set that is most enjoyed to play with. It will be a favourite for children. The looks are not that good, so it's not the best piece to fit in your Lego village.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Fun to build!</li><li>Looks good, and playable</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>the building instructions are extremely hard to read due to lack of color difference between browns, and dark browns.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<ul><li>Cost: The PPP on this set is excellent, assuming that you pick it up at the MSRP or thereabouts. &nbsp;That being said, I don't see that there are any particularly rare/valuable/interesting bricks and there are a lot of little 1x1 pieces. &nbsp;Since I don't buy sets for MOCing it isn't a big issue for me. &nbsp;I will note that this is the first time I've seen the little frog piece, which really is quite cute.</li></ul><ul><li>The various builds: &nbsp;I've only built the ""advanced"" build as the other easy/medium build versions simply didn't look all that interesting to me. &nbsp;That's just my opinion though. &nbsp;The advanced build isn't particularly difficult or time-consuming. &nbsp;The ladder, as&nbsp;MaartenRF10, is a nice touch. &nbsp;Otherwise, this is fairly straight-forward as builds go.&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>The final product/appearance: &nbsp;The biggest issue with this set is a combination of the tree/house as fellow reviewer&nbsp;MaartenRF10 noted. &nbsp;My opinion on this is that the ""house"" is, perhaps, a bit fancy... and somewhat exposed to the elements. &nbsp;The other issue is that the tree has been, at best, defoliated. &nbsp;However, this isn't exactly a surprise - the pictures all clearly show the tree. &nbsp;I do believe that it wouldn't have been difficult or expensive for LEGO to have added some of the ""Limb Element"" (http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=241728) pieces, which would have dressed this up a bit. &nbsp;However, there's no reason that a handful of these couldn't be added to the completed advanced version build. &nbsp;As it is, without any additions, the advanced version of the Tree House is acceptably good-looking. &nbsp;I should note that the size of the set and the ""house"" in the tree are at least in proportion to ""real life"" analogues.</li></ul><ul><li>Playability: &nbsp;it's pretty good with this set as both reviewers Limpfittz and&nbsp;MaartenRF10 have noted. &nbsp;If you combined this with the Log Cabin set (http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=5766-1) I think you'd really have something. &nbsp;Nonetheless, on its own, it's not bad. &nbsp;However, with just one minifig it's tougher than it should be - I think a second or third minifig makes this a bit more fun and compelling.</li></ul>
<p>If you have other houses, in particular the Log Cabin (5766), I think this is a good set to get - they compliment each other quite nicely. &nbsp;Otherwise, on its own, it's ok but I'd recommend at least a few additional minifigs - any children minifigs from other sets, or one of the collectible minifigs such as 8831-10 Jungle Boy (http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8831-10).</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
