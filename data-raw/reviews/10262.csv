A great little set though and here's why.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Andrea is smartly dressed, the clothes she's in, in this set look perfect for her attending Heartlake High with Stephanie and the others. I love the print detail on her torso with the necklace, yep this is a great Mini-Doll. 
<li>This set is loaded with accessories, you get the bows, sunglasses and other great attachments for the Friends' Mini-Doll hair, plus there are two different types of brushes, a hair dryer, a small hand mirror and two lipsticks. All of them are in a light blue colour except the lipstick, the largest amount of accessories in a set this small with exception to some of the sets where animals are included. Oh yes and on the top of all that you also get a laptop. 
<li>The builds in this set are all really fun looking and easy to build, there's a great looking vanity with storage for the hair accessories and places to put the four hand-held accessories, you also get a reflective sticker that really works for the mirror. 
<li>The small bench and makeup counter holds the lipstick and three differently shaped jars of perfume, this includes a fancy looking piece that I really like, it's a gold coloured piece that reminds me of a flower vase or something, I'm not sure on the official name of it. ID # is 6006217. 
<li>The small desk Andrea has includes a flower with transparent mini-figure head vase.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>This set doesn't include an actual bed for Andrea to use, however one can easily be added with parts from your collection so it isn't too much of a con honestly. (Actually, I stand corrected, there is a minor alternate build for the couch that makes a fold out bed for Andrea, still not very comfortable looking for the poor Mini-Doll though.)</li></ul>
<p>Overall this set is pretty impressive and I can honestly say that there aren't very many things against it. The trick is finding it for MSRP after Christmas because this thing has sold out everywhere and it's one I highly recommend picking up. I kind of would have liked it if Andrea also had a microphone in her room, since she does love singing and wants to be a pop star and all that, still it isn't that big of a deal. I'm glad there's storage space for all the accessories too, that's a huge bonus.</p>

<p>Although this set has no bed, the couch can unfold and transform into a bed. Includes a laptop, sticker mirror, hair accessories, lipstick, and perfume bottles. Also includes an extra lipstick and other extra bricks. Andrea also has a nice outfit. Overall, this is a nice set.&nbsp;</p>
