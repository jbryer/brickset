I have amassed a small collection of minifigs and smaller sets pretty quickly because I don&#39;t have kids, I have disposable income, and time alone in the evening waiting for my husband to get home from work (he gets home later than I do)!</p>

<p>This was the very first set I built. I actually have a Minecraft set that sat in the box for over a year because I was a bit intimidated by the tinyness and quantity of parts. I never had Lego as child - my parents said they were too expensive.</p>

<p>One night, being bored and home alone while the husbeast was working, I decided to go to Walgreens and buy stupid things. I checked out the toy aisle, and spotted a few small Friends sets. I had read some articles recently about toys and gender segregation, and whether the Friends line tends to isolate play by girls. You can go Google the articles and arguments. I was curious to see just how girly they are, and so I picked up this set and a polybag one with a fawn, so I could begin to judge for myself.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was a cardboard box, bright printing, lots of purple. Not much else to say - I recycled it. I am not keeping the boxes for any but my more favored and larger sets.</p>

<p>As a new Lego-er, I found the instructions very clear, and was able to very easily follow them to put the set together. As someone who sometimes writes documentation in my day job, I was actually pretty impressed at how clear they are without any text, with only images.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I have discovered that if you give me parts to make a tree in a set, I&#39;m pretty happy.</p>

<p>Also comes with a surfboard and a popsicle. Yay - my Yeti minifig can have another flavour!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I am kind of meh about the Friends minifigs. Their hair is nice, and they are cute, but they are just too different than the rest of the Lego line, and I prefer the more standard mini-figs. In fact, a lot of my purchases are influenced by how much I like the figs. If I was a little girl, and this was the only sets I had, I probably would have like them though. I did play with dolls as a girl, and these are pretty so I would have liked them, since it&#39;s not ALL pink ALL the time.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple and straightforward, nothing difficult to put together. I think younger kids might find the round button pieces (sorry, I don&#39;t know all the part names people use yet) a little fiddly.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t impressed with the fruit crate - it&#39;s kind of wobbly, and as a person who lived in Florida amidst a multitude of fruit stands, I&#39;ve never seen a pink fruit crate. I would have preferred the boxy part to be the same brown as the top of the stand.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A cute set. A vehicle (I did collect Hot Wheels as a kid, so that might be the reason for my fondness for a vehicle in a &quot;girls&quot; toy),&nbsp; a fruit stand, a tree, and a surf board. Lots for the figure to do. Though I think an additional figure might have made this set better - after all, the fruit stand needs a clerk as well as a customer, unless it is a self-serve honor system stand!</p>

<p>And - hey! Dune buggy! Vroom! I will admit to put-putting it about after building it. And it&#39;s purple. I actually like purple, it&#39;s not too obnoxious. I feel even dudes would enjoy purple vehicles.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, I find the pink fruit crate odd, but the pink and turquoise fruit stand is actually a pretty standard Florida color scheme, so that didn&#39;t bother me.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have actually chilled out a little on my dislike of pink in products marketed to women and girls *as long as* there are other colors available. The Pink Factor of this particular set is actually pretty low - the floorboard of the dune buggy, the figure&#39;s shirt, and a small part of the fruit stand has pink, but it&#39;s not overwhelming and splashed on everything. It makes sense in the overall color scheme, since a lot of girls DO like pink. The figure isn&#39;t all in pink, and other than the fruit crate, it&#39;s pretty chill.</p>

<p>I enjoyed building this set plus the Fawn polybag set so much that evening that it inspired me to put together my Minecraft set, and set me on the road to being a Lego collector. So overall, I do like it.</p>
