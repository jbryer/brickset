<ul>
	<li>Fantastic parts selection in some great colors - i.e. - white boat hulls, trans purple 1x2, more</li>
	<li>Heartlake City actually has boys!</li>
	<li>Tons of playability</li>
	<li>Fully furnished, no corners were cut</li>
	<li>intricate details, especially in the interior</li>
	<li>2 dolphins are different shades - nice touch</li>
	<li>enjoyable building experience</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Only 3 minidolls (not surprising for Friends, but a Captain would have been a nice touch)</li>
</ul>

<p>A fantastic design with great parts and nice detailed touches. &nbsp;Should be a must have for any Friends fan, and is in my opinion one of the finest non-exclusive sets of the year - in any theme.</p>

"Bella_Sparkle","2015-01-25T22:19:11.45Z","Great Set!","<p>The Lego friends Dolphin Cruiser is a <b><i>must have </i></b>Lego set for all young girls.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are clear and concise. The box provides plenty of photos for young girls to clearly see what they are building.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The interesting parts keep girls in suspense to see what will come next(instead of the usual 2x3 pieces). The color&nbsp;palette is girly.</p>

<h3>Mini Figures</h3>

<p>Great decision adding a boy into this set. Which is very rare in girls&#39; sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was great fun. It took me about 2-3 days to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Spectacular! Entertaining to play with! My brother loves combining our sets to create more clever games!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<h3><strong>Great set! Must have! Entertainment for hours!</strong></h3>
