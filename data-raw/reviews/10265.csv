However it's taken me a while to figure out the best approach to reviewing the item, also I didn't want to spoil any of the surprises. We're at December 24th today and have finished building all of our little gifts, so why not discuss the benefits of this set. As well as it's weaknesses.</p>
<p>Bear in mind this is my first Advent Calendar, so I've got no real hope of comparing it to anything. Still, I hope this will help people out on whether or not its a good purchase.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>Advent Calendars do not have dedicated instruction manuals, instead you are meant to build each day's gift based on a picture on the inside of the flap. Sometimes this can lead to guess work on where everything goes, more often than not it isn't too big of an issue.</p>
<p>The packaging on this Advent Calendar is really impressive, I enjoy the dual nature of its function allowing you to see great artwork and bits of the set while also having a fun background to display your entire calendar's contents on when it's finished. It's a box I may actually keep compared to recycling which I do with all of my other LEGO boxes. (Mostly due to space constraints.)</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>There are a lot of parts in this set, 213 to be exact and some of them are useful, some of them are just your standard colours and such. I don't think I can go over every single useful part or interesting piece here, it'd take far too long. I do enjoy the fact that they included the skate accessories from the CMF in one of the windows, as I missed both the Figure Skater and Hockey Player, so getting them here was a welcome treat.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Day 1 Features the Mini-Doll Stephanie, she's wearing a nice festive scarf and jacket on her print and works quite nicely as a unique Mini-Doll. She's pretty good actually.</p>
<p>Day 4 introduces the new Mini-Doll character Lily, she's dressed in a nice red and white ensemble, very festive. And I believe a re-use of Mini-Doll parts from last year's Advent Calendar, which was hard to come by so it's nice to see them again.</p>
<p>And that's it... Quite frankly I'm already feeling slightly gipped. LEGO City and Star Wars Advent Calendars get at minimum 5 Minifigures. (And a lot of the stuff in the Friends Calendar could have been combined into one window allowing for more space for another Mini-Doll or two.) Sadly this seems to be LEGOs plan for the Friends Advent Calendars... I really don't understand why you only receive 2 it happened last year as well.</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>I'll take a brief moment here to say that each of the day's gifts involves very simple micro-building. A great idea for the models in this situation, not so satisfying if you just open it one day at a time, still that's how you're meant to play with these. And some days don't involve much building at all really, it's pretty difficult to judge this category then accurately so I'll just say if you're buing this it isn't for the build. It's for the interactive bit of collecting fun that 24 days of micro-builds means.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>Rather than try and discuss everything I'll give a brief overview, we've seen Days 1 and 4 those are the Mini-Dolls, let's go through all 22 remaining doors starting with...</p>
<p>Day 2 Right off the bat LEGO's starting off strong, here we find a nice little sled for Stephanie to ride around on and drive. It looks nice for what you get parts wise and works.</p>
<p>Day 3 this is a clever little street light microbuild, I really like it. It's simple, and the Christmas decoration on the side of holly looks quite festive. So far we're off to a good start.</p>
<p>Day 5 This is a very impressive little build, a winter stall for selling goods and presents to the Friends Mini-Dolls. Right now it's pretty empty, the design is nice though and looks quite festive with the red and green&nbsp;blossoms on the front.</p>
<p>Day 6 is three Perfume bottles of various sizes and some other kind of item built out of two studs, one made from those new gold coin studs LEGO has started using with the smooth tops... They're meant to be what the stall sells from day 5. It's pretty lackluster as far as building is concerned, these are pretty much accessories for the previous stall. This isn't uncommon in LEGO Adventa Calendars from what I understand, still it could have used a bit more.</p>
<p>Day 7 we get another stall for selling things on this day, slightly different colours, but pretty much an identical build to Day 5. This one is decorated with a small leaf instead of flower blossoms.</p>
<p>Day 8 two mugs, a carton of milk and an icing topped treat for the stall to sell, all sitting on a tray. This goes nice with the stall from Day 7, plus there are enough spare pieces to build two of the pastries if you wanted.</p>
<p>Day 9 At first these won't make much sense when you first build them. They are actually meant to go with something else in the calendar, both of the items are designed and built to hold the Friends Accessories. (Hairbows, sunglasses, tiaras, hand mirror and hair dryer.) In fact...</p>
<p>That's exactly what you get on Day 10, a bag full of little accessories. No building whatsoever today. I like the wreath they built on Day 9 as part of the accessory holding tool. And it's nice that these accessories are in a dark purple colour. It's just not too exciting if you were hoping to build more stuff.</p>
<p>Day 11 is even worse than Day 10, here you only receive a 100 dollar LEGO bill, a pink basket and two gold coin studs for buying stuff from the stalls I guess. Really, they wasted a potential Mini-Doll slot on just four pieces of accessories? Why not include them with a brand new Mini-Doll? It would have been a lot better and not as dissapointing.</p>
<p>Day 12 2 Buildable presents using bricks and tiles... Not so bad, not as bad as Day 11 at least. Still not the best as far as decent design choices go.</p>
<p>Day 13 Ah here's a nice solid buildable micro-model. It's the back half of the sled from Day 2, it fits over a small post and can be used to carry either a Mini-Doll or one of the presents from Day 12 to be delivered. This day is pretty solid honestly.</p>
<p>Day 14 When I first saw this I thought it was a complete waste, until I realized that this is a beautiful little fountain to put in the center of your display once everything is built. The transparent blue crystal on top is meant to be frozen water.This is a very clever little micro-build turning the medium sized dish upside down to be the fountain's basin... I just really found this to be one of the better offerings from this year's calendar.</p>
<p>Day 15 Here's another solid number, it's a little blue bench for your Mini-Dolls to sit on. Pretty neat and not a bad micro-build. Good effort on LEGOs part here.</p>
<p>Day 16 Ah, here we have the figure skates for both Mini-Dolls and what appears to be a small section of pathway near the ice rink. Or maybe it's so the Mini-Dolls can stand on it while wearing the skates on the box top, it also has a flower with a nice snow covered effect on one of the blossoms using a white stud. (Obviously flowers don't bloom in winter so these must be decorative plastic ones at the side of the ice rink.) This day could have used a bit more foresight, but the skates are pretty nifty and you get 5... Um... Maybe 6 would have been better than just sticking one extra odd ball skate in there LEGO.</p>
<p>Day 17 This is one of the best Micro-builds in the entire calendar. It's an I-Pod docking station, six pieces are used to build a small I-Pod docking station with speakers and the I-Pod printed tile from many Friends sets is included to dock with it. I really loved this little model, it was just as clever a little build as the radio from Mia's Bedroom last year and works great in any of the other Friends sets.</p>
<p>Day 18 Snowman, Snowman made of ice; Snowman, Snowman very nice. This uses 8 pieces, a light purple touque, a white mini-figure head, a red bandana a brown broom and a few other white pieces to build a short little snowman that is just so adorable and fun. It's one of the better offerings from the calendar this year and a favorite of many, if only because of the touque.</p>
<p>Day 19 An outdoor fire pit? Some place to warm your fingers and roast chestnuts with perhaps while visiting outside in the frosty December air... I honestly have no idea what LEGO was aiming at with this one folks, it isn't much to talk about. It's only saving grace is the fact that you might be able to use the parts in some MOC build.</p>
<p>Day 20 The Christmas tree... Seriously? They gave us the Christmas Tree on Day 20? Don't get me wrong it's a nice Christmas tree, with a great use of the star shaped stud piece for the top of the tree. The problem is why put it behind this one? I think saving it for a later day might have been for the best, especially when we get to... But I'm getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>Day 21 This is just sad, it's more sad when you think a Mini-Doll could have been included here because what you have here are a few minor accessories. A small lamp and a song sheet for taking caroling. There are enough spare pieces to actually build two of the small lamps, so I suppose it isn't a total loss... Still it isn't much.</p>
<p>Day 22 Ah, here's the small box with the leaf on it which we'll be seeing used for something else. Yep it's a place for the animal we're getting in...</p>
<p>Day 23 a squirrel with a bow for her tail. <strong>A squirrel with a bow for her tail!</strong> Call me crazy LEGO, but I think here it might have been better to reverse the contents of the two doors. Day 22 should have been the animal and Day 23 should have been the box for her to sit in. Incidentally the box for the set shows this little animal home being attached to the Christmas tree. I think it's a bit big for the tree honestly, but it might look better on a larger tree build.</p>
<p>And that brings us to today, the final day of the advent calendar. And what did we get on Day 24? A much larger tile built present. Yes, that's the big payoff for this advent calendar. No Friends version of Santa, no special festive build, just another present. Honestly this is really weak and poor planning on LEGO's part, it's going to be a big dissapointment for some of the kids who bought this hoping for something really special on December 24th.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>What are my thoughts overall on this year's advent calendar? While a lot of the builds work well together the fact that little girls who may have brothers or other friends getting LEGO City and Star Wars Advent Calendars they're going to see what their friends got and see what they get in this one and wonder where their Santa is. Or in fact why they only got two characters while everyone else got five.</p>
<p>LEGO seriously needs to take the time to re-think their choices for what goes into these Advent Calendars. As far as the Friends line is concerned a lot of what's here could have just been part of a big Winter Friends set and you wouldn't feel so cheated when you look at what's there. There are a lot less pieces, only two Mini-Dolls and some of the stuff behind the doors is very poorly planned out. (Did we really need two days worth of buildable presents? And why was one of those days December 24th?)</p>
<p>If you've bought this thing and your kids are looking at it when all is said and done and finding themselves a bit let down, well I can't blame them. LEGO has missed the mark here in certain parts, and while a lot of the stuff in this set that you actually build is pretty clever and fun. (I love the stalls and everything when they're all put together on the shelf.) The fact that they waste at least three or four days on things that could have been included in other days leaving space for more Mini-Dolls means that this is not worth the Canadian asking price of 40$... LEGO, next year if you're going to make 3 Advent Calendars for all of the demographics, please, please, please try better at really filling up the Friends Advent Calendar. I mean there is a lot of potential here for a great design, sadly LEGO seems to be missing the mark, as I've read reviews for last years limited run calendar and they made pretty similar mistakes in that one too.</p>
<p>Mildly recommended for after the holidays, if you can find it and if it is marked down to 20$ because that's all this thing is honestly worth.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
