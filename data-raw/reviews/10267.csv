"Jskelton1994","2013-08-12T05:11:48.95Z","Brilliant Set, but needs a few tweaks","<p><strong>WARNING - This review is quite long</strong></p>
<p>I picked this set up a few days back so its still early days but&nbsp;ive been thinking about this set a lot so feel it&nbsp;acceptable to review&nbsp;so soon&nbsp;for you good folk. After a year or so&nbsp;away from&nbsp;Lego Technic (how I managed that I don’t know) I decided to rekindle my passion for building.&nbsp;I bought this set because it looked quite cool. I didn’t really look at the part count or even the price, I bought it out of impulse and i'm&nbsp;glad I did.&nbsp;</p>
<H4 style=""MARGIN: auto 0cm"">Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is large and quite heavy for a Lego model from what I remember, but with 2600 parts you’d&nbsp;expect it would be a little on the heavy side. The instructions, for which there are many, are clear and just like pretty much all Lego Technic instructions. Although they were kind of simple for my experience level but I didn’t notice that until I flicked through them afterwards.</p>
<H4 style=""MARGIN: auto 0cm"">Parts</h4>
<p>well what can I say about parts... after selling all my Lego a year or so ago I have had a hole in my room where only Lego Technic could of filled, and now I have over 2600 parts waiting to be lovingly placed together. There are many fantastic new parts which will defiantly come in handy in the future. but a word of caution although it does say 2600 parts there are an awful lot of pin connectors in all shapes and sizes so most of that grand total will probably be the cheap stuff, but that said nobody would be disappointed getting this many Lego pieces.</p>
<H4 style=""MARGIN: auto 0cm"">The build</h4>
<p>I found the build enjoyable, even the girlfriend joined in and built the entire crane body minus the boom, a few mistakes but I can’t complain she did her best. The instructions were lengthy and sometimes only gave you a few parts to place which were kind of pointless, but so long as it got built I wasn’t too bothered.</p>
<p>There were plenty of interesting mechanisms to drool over and interesting future improvements noted.</p>
<p>Also the model kept growing and growing, does this thing ever end...</p>
<H4 style=""MARGIN: auto 0cm"">The completed model</h4>
<p>It’s massive! I&nbsp;honestly didn’t think it would be this big! although the boom doesn’t extend as far as I thought.&nbsp; But in my opinion Lego Technic models shouldn’t be perfect, this distracts from what Technic is all about, building something and modifying then rebuilding etc etc so room for improvement is a big plus for me.</p>
<p>There are alot of interesting features on this model, like opening doors and tilting chairs. But the doors on top of the main body cant be opened until the crane body and boom are removed. which is rather annoying...</p>
<H4 style=""MARGIN: auto 0cm"">Summary</h4>
<p>The model is big, the parts are many, fun to build and will give hours of fun just as it is.</p>
<p>But there are a few improvements that would have to be made to satisfy an engineering student&nbsp;like me, but as I said before this isn’t for LEGO to do, it’s for our imaginations and hands to complete.</p>
<p>improvements:-</p>
<p>1) Longer and stronger boom</p>
<p>2) Stronger Motor (the XL would have done the job better; they used the L motor because they’d just brought it out recently)</p>
<p>3) No clutch gears (these things are the bain of my life! they slip too much and are completely unrealistic in engineering terms)</p>
<p>4) Would of been nice to see the LEGO designers factor in someone wanting to make it RC driven at the drawing board stage, this would mean someone with no experience what so ever could dive straight in and find the right place to put motors, IR receivers and see there’s space for a gearbox etc</p>
<p>5) The outriggers aren’t strong enough to lift the vehicle; this may be due to those stupid clutch gears though.</p>
<p>6) I will be making this model completely RC in the future, so will be tearing out all those lovely gear selectors and placing in 8 motors for all the functions.</p>
<p>7) More doors and openings...</p>
<h4>Last word</h4>
<p>Buy it! this model WILL give you enjoyment for years to come as it has a spectacular range of parts which can be reused.... happy building :)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Duq","2014-01-08T13:00:55.443Z","Mk II is better but by no means perfect.","<p>Eight years after the brilliant 8421 Mobile Crane here's Mk II. It's gained some weight and grown an extra axle. I just had to get it...
</p>
<h3>Box/Instructions</h3><p>Big. The box is big, the instructions are big. Unfortunately the box is of the have-to-rip-to-open type. The images are what you'd expect; the front showing the crane with all its functions, the back showing the alternative model with its functions. While the box claims '2 in 1' that's not true for the instructions; only instructions for the main model are included. Mind you, they take 6 books and a total of 411 pages!</p><p>I think the instructions could be much shorter. For a start you don't need 1:1 images of axles and beams on every page. They could be at the start of the instructions like they used to be or maybe on a separate reference card. There are many pages where just one or two parts are added. This is a model or experienced builders, it's ok to be difficult... </p><p></p>
<h3>Parts</h3><p>At the time of release this is the biggest Technic set on parts 
count; 2606. A whopping 980 of them (38%) are pins. Another 303 (12%) 
are axles.</p><p>The parts arrive in 24 bags; 15 for the carrier, 5 for the superstructure and 4 for the boom. The battery box, motor, tyres and the 32L axles are loose in the box.</p>After the pins and axles the other half of the parts are mainly beams and various connectors as well as an impressive 129 gears including 4 of the new sliding 8T gears. Some of the more interesting parts: 2 large Linear Actuators and 4 small ones, some panels including a new type of curved panel with a lot more holes than before, some long Technic bricks because there's still no studless alternative for the 1x4 gear racks, a battery box and the new L-motor but no switch or PF remote.<br><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The build</h3><p>Building this monster is quite an undertaking. You start with the 15 bags and 3 books that make up the carrier. There are some interesting building techniques used as well as some tedious sequences where you're stringing beams together. There's a gearbox in the chassis for switching between the two outrigger functions and there's the steering of 4 of the 5 axles. <br></p><p>The most interesting part of the carrier was the construction of the outriggers. They wouldn't be possible without the new 8T gear that slides on an axle. It'll be interesting to see where else this part will be used.</p><p>Next are the 5 bags and 2 books to build the superstructure. The gearbox for various functions takes up a lot of space here and there's a lot of gears involved in the superstructure functions; lifting and extending the boom as well as lifting the load. Once all that is in place you add the cosmetic parts; panels and a drivers cab.</p><p>Once the superstructure is placed on the carrier there are 4 bags left to construct the boom. The inner sections are built from old-school Technic beams while the outer section takes its shape from the curved 11x3 panels. The extending mechanism works with strings like in real life. Interestingly it uses wheels with tyres for smooth operation.</p><p>I'm not sure why, but while building this model I found it harder than usual to keep track of which parts belonged to which function. Whether it's the way the model is designed or the sequence in the instructions.<br></p><p></p>
<h3>The completed model</h3><p>The model looks the part. There are many styling elements that work to make it look like the real thing, from the oval profile of the boom to the shape of the cabs and details like mirrors. The functions work well; the steering, the outriggers, raising and extending the boom... All works and with the colour coding for direction it's easy to operate.</p><p>You can't help but compare this to the previous mobile crane, set 8421. It's bigger, heavier, has more wheels and a longer boom. A few statistics:</p><p>38% more parts, 65% more pins, 24% longer overall, 34% longer boom, 104% more instruction pages.</p><p>Let's start with the good news. It looks better. At the front at least. The boom looks more realistic, the cab has mirrors and opening doors and the hook looks better. The back is a different story; the ugly grey battery box that dominates the back ruins what is otherwise a much better looking superstructure.</p><p>The outriggers are a big improvement. On the 8421 they were functional but looked nothing like real life. These ones do. It would have been nice if they had reached down another plate or two to actually take the weight off the wheels but that's a detail.</p><p>Raising the boom has also massively improved. The pneumatic system on the 8421 was the best option at the time but was just too crude, especially when lowering the boom. The linear actuators do a much better job, even if they made the same gearing mistake as on the 8043 Excavator.<br></p><p>It has an extra axle. That looks good but comes at a price: the turning circle is nearly twice as big as for the 8421! Measured on the outside of the fixed axle the turning circle for 8421 is 55cm, for 42009 it's 107cm. I find this very disappointing. The 8421 turns as tight as is possible. This longer crane was always going to have a bigger turning circle, but twice as big? That's just not good enough.<br></p><p>The boom is longer than on the 8421 but extends by the same length, so relative to its length it's actually worse than the 8421. This is another disappointment. I had expected this boom to be an improvement not just in looks but also in performance. It should extend by more than it does now.<br></p><p></p>
<h3>Overall opinion</h3><p>So for the final verdict. An impressive looking model with many well-designed functions. It's just not as much of an improvement on 8421 as I had hoped.</p><p>Value for money is pretty good. Compared to for example 8110 Unimog which sold at the same price you get more parts and a better looking, better functioning model.<br></p><p></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,5

<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Large chunk of piece count consumed by pins/connectors, as noted by other reviewers</li><li>Included motor not as powerful as XL motor - XL would serve this model much better</li><li>Outriggers deploy quickly, but legs extend/retract very slowly (due to motor selection)</li><li>Another set of pulleys at top for further force reduction would have been great - would have added to the realism</li><li>Addition of forward or reverse drive would have been simple and great, though the XL motor would have served this better. &nbsp;A miss in my opinion.</li></ul>
<p>All in all, this was an outstanding example of Technic at its finest and shouldn't be missed. &nbsp;To resolve the cons above would add another $30-50 to the already high cost. &nbsp;Make sure there's plenty of room on your shelf for this beast!</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4

"aldredd","2014-06-13T16:35:40.553Z","Almost perfect, but not quite","<p>I have fond memories of building 8053 mobile crane, so when I saw it had been re-released, I had to have it, and pestered the wife until she bought it for my birthday.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>It&#39;s a large box, but it&#39;s a full one. With 6 manuals covering the 3 build stages. Parts are in bags marked 1-3 depending on the stage. I would have liked to see more &#39;order&#39; to the parts - they were very jumbles even with the build stage 1, and spent quite a bit of timing pre-sorting.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a good selection of parts in this set, with notable ones including 2 large LA&#39;s, 4 small LA&#39;s, a small motor / battery box, a 32l axle and of course the new frictionless 8 tooth gear - a great addition to the parts catalog.</p>

<p>Some have reported getting a spare 32l&nbsp;axle - I didn&#39;t get this.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I was expecting a build similar to 8053 but really, there is very little in common with its predecessor. One key memory of 8053 was the complexity of the steering mechanisms, but they&#39;ve stripped all this overly complex area into something much more simple &amp; effective. which makes sense, of course.</p>

<p>the use of the 32l axle confuses me - it really doesn&#39;t need to be there - there&#39;s able room for a few shorter ones joined up, which I would expect to also reduce the strain on the 32l - it powers the outriggers, so being connected to the motor makes it prone to twisting.</p>

<p>There are a few tricky / fiddly parts, but nothing a seasonable builder will have any worries about.</p>

<p>The build is enjoyable, and surprisingly un-repetitive - something I see to recall 8053 being. Other than the building of the outriggers, there&#39;s very little duplication in build effort for this set.</p>

<p>Building the super structure is just pure genius&nbsp;seeing it all fit together with the 4-selection gear box. The boom was again a bit fiddly, especially as I kept fitting the wrong parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The overall model looks amazing - but there are just a few criticisms</p>

<p>1. The motor, imo, is very weak and should have been a large one. The boom extension was really struggling at times.</p>

<p>2. The &#39;cable&#39; doesn&#39;t feed / retract as the boom raises or lowers, so you have to constantly stop, switch the gear box to the winch, and slack the winch.</p>

<p>The above are minor technical details. However, my main worry is the colouring of parts. The yellows are without a doubt different shades - even beams of different lengths are different colours - it&#39;s really noticeable as you build. Thankfully it&#39;s less noticeable on the final build, but this is a real poor show from a company priding itself in qualify control, in my view.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Regardless of the technical issues, and the colouring issue - this is still an incredible set. Different enough from 8053 for you to not feel like you&#39;re just rebuilding the same model, but close enough to bring back the nostalgia. A must for technics fans!</p>

"FlagsNZ","2014-05-12T08:52:17.897Z","The truly awsome MkII (or is it Mk III) Mobile Crane","<p>I had earmarked this set as a Christmas present when I saw it in a catalogue&nbsp;in mid 2013.</p>

<p>I wonder though if it is really the Mk III Mobile Crane. Set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/855-1/Mobile-Crane"">855</a> is Mk I, Set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8421-1/Mobile-Crane"">8421</a> is Mk II so that makes this set the Mk III Lego Technic Mobile Crane.</p>

<p>My Lego Technic experience was ignited with Sets 855 and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/857-1/Motorbike-with-Sidecar"">857</a> in 1980, 34 years ago. I have always cherished these two sets and I am fortunate to have recently returned them to original condition.</p>

<p>I was really looking forward to tackling this set and it has met all expectations.</p>

<p>The set is based on a&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.liebherr.com/AT/en-GB/default_at.wfw/measure-metric"">Liebherr</a>&nbsp;mobile crane.&nbsp;Liebherr&nbsp;have a reputation for &nbsp;being one of the world&#39;s leading manufacture of construction machinery. This set looks and feels very similar to their&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.liebherr.com/AT/en-GB/products_at.wfw/id-4294-0/measure-metric"">LTM&nbsp;1200-5.1 crane</a>.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is HUGE. It has some really great photos and graphics are terrific. You immediately get a feel for the magnitude of the build when you see that there are six instruction books.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are heaps of parts. Reviews have made much of the number the blue and black connectors. With Technic Lego moving away from studs and to more realistic studless look, there is only one way to join those beams. A review of any other recent build will show that the proportion of the blue and black connectors is consistent&nbsp;in this model when compared to other sets.</p>

<p>With the move away from studs, there will be more connectors in future Technic models.</p>

<p>The density and complexity of the gear box in the crane house leaves little room to spare.</p>

<p>The L Motor&nbsp; fits nicely and there would be insufficient room for the larger <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8882-1/XL-Motor"">XL Motor</a>.</p>

<p>A second motor could have been used to power the engine and outriggers with the existing outrigger function being allocated to slewing the crane body. This is a modification&nbsp;I will be looking at in the near future.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>While not part of this set, A slight modification to the seat in the crane cab by lowering the seat will enable an <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/5002914-1/THE-LEGO-MOVIE-Emmet-Key-Light"">Emmet</a> key light&nbsp;<em>Minifigure&nbsp;</em>to operate the crane.

<h3><img alt="""" src=""E:\DCIM\108CANON"" />The build</h3>

<p>It took the best parts of two full days to build this model. It kept me busy during Christmas.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is fantastic. I have used this model to teach cranes, blocks and tackles, mechanical advantage, velocity ratios etc. There is a real feel for using cranes when operating this set.</p>

<p>While the outriggers take time to deploy, they add real stability to this crane. Lifting weights when the crane is at right angles to the chassis will soon show the need for these stabilisers. I used a pair of padlocks as the test weights.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5500/14479974787_6d39bd0114.jpg"" /></p>

<p>While they are not strong enough to lift the crane up off its tyres, they have sufficient lift to stop the crane from driving off when fully deployed.</p>

<p>The delay in setting the crane up by deploying the outriggers matches the time taken to use such a crane in the real world.</p>

<p>The companion model&nbsp;<em>Reach Stacker </em>is realistically based on a Bellotii forklift. The forklift, 20&#39;&nbsp;container and little truck all made from one set is impressive and is an indication of the size and complexity of the main model.</p>

<p>I like the use of two gear boxes and believe using these gears has educational value.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3899/14715392542_faa3e253dc.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There is probably room for Lego to create an accessory set for all their cranes and forklift trucks. Perhaps&nbsp;a set so that a 20&#39; container, cargo pallet and associated lifting gear, chains and hooks to compliment this set.</p>

<p>This crane sets nicely next to my 855 Mobile Crane.</p>

"MSHunters","2015-03-04T05:36:59.587Z","First flagship ever, nothing short of impressive","<h2><strong>DANGER - Long review ahead; read at your own risk!</strong></h2>

<p>I walked into a local Lego Store after my first paycheck one day to see what was available since my last purchase back in 2011 (<em>8070 Supercar</em>). Technically, that would&#39;ve been a lie since I obtained the <em>42025 Cargo Plane</em> exactly a week before I had this one. Of course, it had been 4 long years since I paid any attention to Lego; this was attributed to mainly studies and the only reason I bought the <em>8070</em> in the first place was purely out of interest for cars.</p>

<p>Anyway, let&#39;s just ignore the fact that I bought the <em>42025</em> earlier for now; I was looking around and I saw two giant boxes sitting side by side, they were the <em>42009 Mk II</em> and the <em>42030 Volvo L350F</em>. After standing around for what seems to be half an hour, I carefully made my decision to take the <em>42009</em> home; and I promise all of you, the box is big, heavy and really satisfying to carry around.</p>

<h3><u><strong>BOX/INSTRUCTIONS</strong></u></h3>

<p>So we have the <em>42009</em> box which weighs quite a lot compared to other sets of this size. This is to be expected since we have over 2600 parts in here and don&#39;t forget the 10 wheels this behemoth is supposed to run on! The box is huge and completely filled with parts unlike other boxes which seem to be only half full most of the time.</p>

<p>The box is the general flagship-type box, is square-ish and has a flap that opens to reveal some of the features of the model. On the top is a 1:1 scale of the wheels and on the rear, a depiction of the B-model; a 2-vehicles-in-1 model consisting of a reach stacker and a container truck. I opened the box on the sides which were taped; saves the trouble of destroying the box which I generally prefer to avoid.</p>

<p>Instructions come in the form of 6 separate booklets, Books 1-3 for the carrier, Books 4-5 for the rotating superstructure and Book 6 for the crane boom. I&#39;ve read other articles stating that later production units used a singular booklet, but mine was not the case. I probably took one of the older units but that isn&#39;t an issue nonetheless.</p>

<p>On a side note, the separated booklets do help in a few ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>They help separate the build into distinct stages, good for stage-by-stage progression</em></li>
	<li><em>They help indicate which parts belong to which book as the parts bags are numbered</em></li>
	<li><em>They make parts breakdown simpler, though I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s any different with a singular booklet</em></li>
</ul>

<p>All 6 booklets were placed in a bag along with the sticker sheet; no cardboard was present however. There weren&#39;t any instructions for the B-model as one might expect. Instructions were clear and easy to follow without being overly simple.</p>

<h3><u><strong>PARTS</strong></u></h3>

<p>Let&#39;s just say that if the first and only set you own is the <em>8070</em> (at 1281 parts), you&#39;re in for quite the build. Coming in at 2606 (!!) parts, this set is the largest Technic set known to date in terms of parts count; at least until the <em>42043 MB Arocs</em> comes into play late in 2015. Hundreds upon hundreds of pins and axles in all sorts of different colors and sizes make up the majority of this set.</p>

<p>One might argue that the parts count comes from mostly the small stuff; not to mention having only a single L motor and a battery box in the PF department. While true, this isn&#39;t an issue since the end result is a large and rigid structure for you to admire; after all the pins are responsible for providing its rigidity. Aside from those, a vast variety of existing Technic parts are provided in the set, including quite a number of linear actuators; 2 regulars for the crane boom and 4 miniatures for the outriggers. More motors and RC functionality could be included; but that&#39;d probably bump the price up considerably.</p>

<p>Sorting trays and a really large table are recommended as you will see lots of tiny parts lying around. I eventually ended up with a number of spare pins and even axles but I can&#39;t tell if this is intentional or if I&#39;ve left something out during the building process.</p>

<h3><u><strong>BUILD</strong></u></h3>

<p>The build is straightforward as mentioned but continuously makes you guess the final size of the completed model. The segments to build are the carrier, superstructure and crane boom and these are independent of one another; one can simply build his or her preferred segment first instead of following any particular order. Again I&#39;m not sure in the case of a singular booklet, but the fact that the 6 booklets contain instructions for individual segments allows for split, semi-modular construction.</p>

<p>Now for the actual build; I&#39;ll try not to spoil too much of the details!</p>

<p><strong>Books 1-3 - Carrier</strong></p>

<p>You start with the central frame and work your way to the front and rear ends; at this point the wheel insertion axles should be ready. Next is the gearbox for switching between outrigger extension and feet raise/drop functions. You then construct the similar but not identical outrigger modules and then the &quot;caps&quot; to cover the remaining blanks; this makes the assembly cleaner and as a feature, these are hinged so they can be folded up to see the sections underneath; a nifty tool for detecting problems in the assembly!</p>

<p>Work then begins to construct the cabin; I initially assumed the full length of the carrier had been reached but this actually increases by several inches after construction is done. The cabin comes with folding doors, two seats, wing mirrors, headlights and a steering wheel which can be placed on either side. A V8 engine sits behind the cabin and warning lights are placed on top of the cabin. Various panels are then used to complete the vehicle.</p>

<p>At the end of book 3, carrier construction is complete along with the 10 wheels and makes a good model to display on its own. It also comes with HOG steering with 8 of the 10 wheels being steered. Each pair of wheels also has a specific steering lock which is a nice detail. The third axle (middle) does not steer but has a differential.</p>

<p>The carrier, as per Lego&#39;s description, is a behemoth with 10 wheels; it&#39;s large and quite nicely decorated. The &quot;caps&quot; mentioned earlier are intuitive and the steering locks are a nice touch; although the turning radius is a little too large in relative scale. It&#39;s also heavy, as&nbsp;(presumably) more than half the parts count went in its construction. Despite the weight, it&#39;s extremely rigid and robust.</p>

<p><strong>Books 4-5 - Superstructure</strong></p>

<p>You start with a turntable secured with several beams. The next part involves adding axles and gears of all sizes and you&#39;ll soon find that the construction becomes incredibly complex. The single L motor that powers all functions is also added. Next are the linear actuators which raise or lower the crane boom. A technical and design error exists in which the gears for the actuators should be facing the same direction and not each other to avoid stressing of the parts; although this may have been intended for symmetry reasons.</p>

<p>In the upper half of the superstructure, a gear setup is used to control the winch. The set comes with roughly 3 meters of string so there&#39;s plenty of room for play later. Building then proceeds to create a gear selector for switching between the various functions. Fairing panels are then used to enhance the overall appearance of the superstructure. There is also a cab for the crane operator and a door on the left side which can be opened manually.</p>

<p>At the end of book 5, the superstructure is complete and can be attached to the carrier. An axle is threaded through the center of the turntable to the carrier, allowing mechanical motion from the superstructure to pass to the outriggers in the carrier. This also allows the structure to rotate 360 degrees without interfering with the mechanical components. Rotation of the superstructure is not motorized unfortunately and is achieved manually.</p>

<p>The superstructure is quite the compact, complex and heavy contraption; the entirety of it powers the 4 core functions using only a single motor and plenty of gears and axles. These provide the resulting weight although the batteries contribute a higher fraction. It is also nicely decorated and the panels give it a refined and smooth appearance. Stickers are also applied on the superstructure to indicate motor directions for the functions.</p>

<p><strong>Book 6 - Crane boom</strong></p>

<p>Only a single booklet is dedicated to the boom. This will cover its construction as well as attaching the assembly to the superstructure to complete the model.</p>

<p>Construction begins with the internal part of the boom, achieved using a series of racks, studded bricks and plates. We then move onto the casing made using several curved panels used to house the internals. The boom itself is telescopic and the effect is achieved using several strings with studs and a pulley system of sorts. A worm gear setup is used in the boom extension mechanism, giving it realistic speeds when used with the PF motor. A rolling wheel is also used inside the boom to assist with extension and retraction.</p>

<p>Not long after, the boom assembly is complete and ready to be attached to the superstructure. This section is the shortest and lightest by comparison and arguably uses the least parts of the three.</p>

<p><strong>Final Assembly</strong></p>

<p>The assembly is completed when the boom is attached to the superstructure and the string from the superstructure is threaded through the upper part of the boom, through a pulley and knotted to a point under the boom. The hook is constructed in-situ and is made of several thin beams and pins.</p>

<h3><u><strong>COMPLETED MODEL</strong></u></h3>

<p><strong>Quick Facts</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Max. height - 77 cm (boom fully raised/extended)</em></li>
	<li><em>Max. length - 59 cm (carrier only)</em></li>
	<li><em>Max. boom angle - 65 degrees</em></li>
	<li><em>Weight - 2.63 kg (2.49 kg w/o batteries)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The model is deceptively large; it achieves an amazing height of 77 cm when the crane boom is fully raised and extended. Scale-wise, this is on the low side as real crane booms stretch much further but for a Lego model, this is impressive. The carrier alone measures at some 59 cm long, evidently longer than most large non-flagship sets; I say most because one exception is the <em>42025 Cargo Plane</em> reaches a staggering length of 62 cm. The maximum boom angle of 65 degrees matches that of actual cranes, if not slightly lower. The model is also heavy, weighing in at<strong> </strong>2.63 kg<strong> </strong>although this isn&#39;t an issue whatsoever as I prefer my models heavy and rigid.</p>

<p>The model is characterized by its rather &quot;slow&quot; functions; the only decently fast operation is the outrigger extension while the rest of the functions need time for them to reach the end of travel with most requiring about 30 seconds and is attributed to heavy gear reductions and frictional loss. In the model&#39;s defense however, these speeds match those of real cranes when scaled appropriately.</p>

<p>The outriggers aren&#39;t strong enough to lift the carrier off its wheels but are however able to prevent it from moving off. This was probably caused by two factors; the outrigger modules being too short due to small actuators, or simply the lack of torque. The string is of rather high quality and coupled with the light hook, slacks unless it&#39;s loaded. The set provides 3 meters of this string as mentioned earlier and thus allows the hook to reach underground levels even when the crane boom is fully raised and extended.</p>

<p>The model consists of mostly yellow and black except for parts of the carrier but these parts are unnoticeable while the crane boom is lowered. The cabs are nicely decorated with doors, wing mirrors and lights placed here and there. The HOG steering at the rear of the carrier is also built with appropriate steering lock angles, complementing the existing details of the model.</p>

<p>The stickers are a nice touch and this set is no different. I would&#39;ve preferred printed parts however as prints don&#39;t need to be aligned and can&#39;t be easily damaged. The stickers in this set are mostly used as set indicators or warning strips. The only troubles I had were how they have to be aligned as well as ensuring they don&#39;t end up creased while applying.</p>

<h3><u><strong>OVERALL OPINION</strong></u></h3>

<p>Building took approximately 10 hours spread across 5 days including photographing. I believe one will get the most fun out of a set&#39;s construction not by rushing its build, but slowly piecing the parts together, understanding how each individual module works and watching it grow; in my case, the photography also adds sentimental value to the set.</p>

<p>Now for the ratings:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>5 - Overall rating - It is a flagship, is large, is visually appealing, has 2606 parts and builds an impressive model</em></li>
	<li><em>5 - Building experience - Complex and intricate yet simple and easy to follow at the same time</em></li>
	<li><em>5 - Parts - 2606 (!!) parts consisting of a huge variety of existing Technic parts</em></li>
	<li><em>5 - Playability - 5 motor functions, other manual functions incl. HOG steering and 360 deg. superstructure rotation</em></li>
	<li><em>5 - Value For Money - For the parts count and variety, aesthetics and the size</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Being the first ever flagship I bought, this set doesn&#39;t fail to impress at all. Generally, improvements can be made but for an official set, this set has quite a lot to offer to everyone whether or not it&#39;s from a typical person&#39;s perspective or otherwise.</p>

<p>I find the set great because of the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Large box</em></li>
	<li><em>Large parts count &amp; parts variety</em></li>
	<li><em>Complex construction but easy-to-follow steps</em></li>
	<li><em>Variety of power and manual functions</em></li>
	<li><em>Semi-modular construction is particularly intuitive</em></li>
	<li><em>Stickers decorate the model well</em></li>
	<li><em>Tiny but noticeable and appealing visual and functional details</em></li>
	<li><em>10 wheels! (8 of which are steered, each pair with their own angles)</em></li>
	<li><em>Nicely detailed and plenty of smooth sections thanks to fairing panels</em></li>
	<li><em>Large overall model, makes a really great display item!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, some recommendations I can suggest:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>To an extent, the addition of RC functionality</em></li>
	<li><em>Replacing some of the grey beams on the carrier with yellow</em></li>
	<li><em>Outriggers strong enough to lift the carrier off its wheels</em></li>
	<li><em>Reducing the gear reduction to improve function speeds</em></li>
	<li><em>Extended boom! (to scale correctly with real mobile cranes)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not least, a tip to all builders; allow some spacing between gears as this eliminates any possibility of the mechanisms operating too slowly. Other than these, it&#39;s hard for me to find any faults in this set and it really is something to behold. It currently sits beautifully in my little family of various Technic vehicles, including the <em>8070 Supercar</em> and the <em>42025 Cargo Plane</em>.</p>

<p>For Technic builders, you&#39;ll want this set for its huge variety of parts as well as if you&#39;re a general fan of large construction machines; this is the largest crane to date as well.</p>

<p>For non-Technic builders, this will still be a joy to build in general and it makes an excellent display model too.</p>

<p>What are you waiting for? Go get one already!</p>

<p><em>EDIT 1: I&#39;ve recently built the 8043 Motorized Excavator, they make a good pair!</em></p>

<p><em>EDIT 2: I&#39;ve again recently obtained the 42030 Volvo L350F Wheel Loader; it&#39;s not constructed yet however but I&#39;m excited to see what a full construction crew looks like.</em></p>

<p><em>EDIT 3: 42030 construction is complete; I basically have a yellow army now!</em></p>
