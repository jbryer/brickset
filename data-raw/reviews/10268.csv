I have given it a rare full rating as it truly satisfies all the criteria I expect to be met.<br><br>(Warning-long list ahead)<br>The good :<br>1. The price is spot on.<br><br>2. The use of color is somehow better executed compared to previous sets with a similar theme. I can't say exactly why its better but it seems the colors work well with this one.<br><br>3. Overall design for both the 4X4 and boat is well done. The 4X4 comes complete with trailer hitch (thus inspiring the heading for this review) and trailer with I actually would like to consider a bonus accessory. The trunk bed doubles as storage for diving equipment or can carry the diver. The opening doors are a feature which I hope Lego retains for the foreseeable future. Included is a boat that really floats! The piece has an excellent choice of color.<br><br>4. Two minifigs are included. Both match the theme well.<br><br>5. A lot of additional pieces such as diving helmet with visor, oxygen tanks, walkie-talkie and loudspeaker are provided to complete the scene.<br><br>The bad:<br>I'm being really picky here but I would perhaps touch on the fact that the minifigs lack the dual expression head piece.&nbsp; But its a minor thing, a small drop in an ocean so to speak :)<br><br>I highly recommend this set and the fun experience that comes with it.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

</p>
<h3>Box/Instructions</h3><p>The set comes in a typical City-style blue box, showing a few play suggestions on the back. Like most City sets there's a guy shouting 'HEY!' on the back of the box - I still don't know why. The instructions are a good 40 pages long.<br></p><p></p>
<h3>Parts</h3><p>128 parts that strangely include a spare blue 2x3 plate. You get the typical contents for a small car; a car base, wheel arches, SNOT pieces to attach grille and rear bumper, doors, a roof piece and some accessories. For this set of course you also get a dinghy.</p><p></p>
<h3>Minifigures</h3><p>Two minifigures in this set; a driver and a diver. Both have nice front and back prints but are far from unique; the torsos are the same as in the other Coast Guard sets and the heads have been used in at least another dozen City sets. Each wears a blue cap while for the diver there's a helmet and breathing apparatus. The driver has the new type life jacket.</p><p>Would have been nice if one of them had been a girl.<br></p><p></p>
<h3>The build</h3><p>It's a straightforward build. There's a few plates faces outwards at the front and back of the car and for the outboard on the dinghy, otherwise all the studs face upwards.<br></p><p></p>
<h3>The completed model</h3><p>The car looks okay but it's too small. Most cars in City are now 6-wide, especially utility vehicles. At 4 wide this looks tiny beside for example the Police pickup in 60045 or the Range Rover in 60058. It also means that the diver has nowhere to sit in the car.</p><p>The dinghy is also too small. The driver and diver barely fit in together; they both have to stand up.<br></p><p></p>
<h3>Overall opinion</h3><p>At the price point it's not a bad set but I would have preferred it to be a few euros more for a 6-wide truck.</p><p>I've given it top marks for playability; car, trailer, boat, accessories for the minifigs, there's a lot to play with. I'd recommend this set as a present for any child.<br></p><p></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"CityIsAwesomne","2018-12-06T15:48:14.853Z","Expensive For A Small Set But Quite Powerful in Other Categories","<p>In my opinion 2013 has probably been the best year for Lego City. Most builds were above avarege and a very small minority was below decent and even then they were quite good. The main focus this year was Coast Guard which while it wasn&#39;t brand-new, it&#39;s heavily improved from the coast guards sets made in 2008. One of the great sets is 60012 Coast Guard 4x4 &amp; Diving Boat which consists of two minifigures, a car, a raft and diving gadgets.</p>

<p>The build in this set that is the main focus is firstly the coast guard car which has room for one driver only which may be unfortunate but it&#39;s ok and I will tell you why later in this review. The colours on this car is mostly white, and some blue, orange and very little grey and I like this colour combination as it does fit the coast guard. What&#39;s greater are probably the two car doors, not only is it quite rare to get them, they even have hings which is just great (even though they are barely useable as you can always remove the roof of the car to get the minifigure and vice versa). In the back of the car is a flatbed where the diving gadgets are found such as mask, tubes and flippers. As great as that is the highlight of the set is the trailer which has an orange raft. The raft is small but is constructed in a great way and even has room for more than one person. The build is great</p>

<p>The minifigures included are two coast guards, one officer who wears grey clothes, blue cap and trousers, and a diver who wears orange clothes instead but with an additional blue cap as well. Great minifigures I must say, especially the diver, his face isn&#39;t the most common or generic as opposed to the officer&#39;s face, he does look even better with the diving gadgets on</p>

<p>You know this set offers great playability for the most part, you&#39;ve got at least two minifigures, great builds and fun gadgets. You will have fun with that, however the reason it doesn&#39;t get a five is because of one thing and one thing only: nothing to save! This is the only coast guard set in 2013 at least that doesn&#39;t come with a civilian in need of help, even the smallest set of the sub theme had a civilian in need of help, nevertheless the raft and amount of gadgets does kinda make up for it since you could play that you&#39;re looking for one of the gadgets.</p>

<p>After all these plus I gave the previous two categories, it&#39;s time for a minus, no set is without flaw and this flaw is the price. 25 bucks for this? No thanks that&#39;s a bit too expensive if you ask me, maybe 20 bucks would&#39;ve been nicer.</p>

<p>Final Score: <strong>4/5</strong> or <strong>7/10</strong>, while not particularly a five in terms of price and playability it does offer some of the latter. The minifigures and overall vehicle with the raft is very nice though and the recommendation level is above really above average and you will have fun with it</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-18T13:39:33.753Z","Boat launcher!","<p>Lego set #60012 is a great addition to any Lego City collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set contains&nbsp;two minifigures, a truck, a trailer, and a little raft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;are nothing unique and are a driver for the truck and a diver with scuba gear, and a hat.</p>

<p>The truck is a fairly standered truck length and has room for a Minifigure, moving doors, storage in the back, and a trailer hitch.</p>

<p>The trailer is about four to five inches long and has moving wheels, an area on top for the raft, and a ball socket hitch to clip to the car.</p>

<p>The raft is the normal small Lego raft but in orange. it has a motor, headlights, and some cool stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>overall this is a very neat set, and my only complaint is that the stickers on the raft can easily come off. This set is perfect to protect any harbour.&nbsp;</p>
