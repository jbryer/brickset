"Whateverist","2013-08-05T08:24:53.363Z","Simple, cheap and suprisingly good","This stunt plane is a very nice and complete set for very little money.<br><br>The airplane looks a lot better in the flesh as it does on the box. It's streamlined with a nice color scheme and in my opinion manages to look better without the stickers. There's a few neat touches like the headrest for the pilot and the very sturdy design for the wings. There are a few design issues though; the propeller hits the ground when you let the plane ride horizontally (as if taking off), and the poor pilot can't see over the massive air intake, but neither of these are showstoppers.<br><br>The little trolley for the mechanic was a pleasant surprise. Extra vehicles in cheap sets all too often feel like they were thrown together from spares, but this is actually a pretty clever and unique vehicle with a nice assortment of tools. The cap-with-headset in particular is really cool.<br><br>Overall, it's a good-looking and sturdy plane with some genuinely well-done accessories for a very good price. <br>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
"WoutStopmotion","2013-10-17T16:30:20.747Z","Guess what flew away out of Hamleys?","This set is a very nice looking plane and a little car with repair equipment for the plane. I bought it at Hamleys whilst i was in London - both the shop and the set shouldn't be missed!<br><br><b>Building Experience<br><br></b>Simple build - it's split up in two parts, the car and the plane. In the beginning you need to connect a lot of white pieces to a black plate, which are very hard to fit in perfectly. A lot of squeezing parts together may occur when building this set. Also, you get a bunch of stickers, which i bet a lot of people don't like. It's also hard to put those on due to the shapes of some pieces. But all the building is definitely worth it, as the finished product looks gorgeous!<br><br><b>Parts<br><br></b>The parts are mostly black, white and yellow. The plane's wings consist of mostly just gigantic black triangle parts which you really can't use anywhere else at all. Ofcourse, making a wing yourself is kind of hard, but i don't like parts like that. But you also get a few nice parts - such as a headphone, and a double spare one, propellors, cockpit window, wheels, and tools on the repair cart.<br><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>It's definitely not hard to imagine a kid holding this plane in his hand and flying around with it! With the repair cart, you could really do a lot of stuff. Just grab a tool and repair the plane - it's even described with a picture on the boxart! One tiny problem is that the cockpit window won't close that well with the figure inside it - but because of the looks of the plane, it's not a major problem to me.<br><br><b>Value for Money</b><br><br>As the prices on Brickset say: 10 pounds. The currency is different from the Euro that i'm used to, but i can perfectly imagine that it's a perfect price.<br><h4><b>Overall Rating</b></h4>A nice looking and very cool set, price is low, lots of playability and style. If you have a Lego City, you definitely shouldn't miss out on this beautiful plane!<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This build is made problematic by the fact that there is an unsupported structural piece inside the hollow shell made by the fuselage parts.&nbsp; As a result, when you squeeze in certain places, there is nothing inside to push back and the model simply comes apart.&nbsp; See &quot;completed model&quot; for more.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is made fragile by the design flaw noted in &quot;the build&quot;.&nbsp; However, it is VERY easy to improve upon this.&nbsp; By simply inserting a few small, strategically-located plates into the fuselage, the structure all-of-a-sudden becomes sound, and in fact quite strong.&nbsp; There are <em>almost </em>enough spare parts in the box to do this without even hitting your parts bin.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Something happened to the design of this one - not sure how it ended up the way it did.&nbsp; But the good news is that with a very small number of spare parts, you can easily turn it from fragile to fun.</p>

"CarolinaOnMyMind","2019-01-04T23:20:36.02Z","From my perspective, this is a ""Rescue"" Plane","<p>Right away I should tell you that I am probably biased and will give this set an overwhelmingly positive review. I&#39;m sure it has some flaws, but I honestly can&#39;t see them. The reason I love it so much is because&nbsp;I have to credit this little plane with bringing me out of my dark ages. And for that reason alone, it will always hold a special place in my heart. It was also the first LEGO set my son ever got/built himself and so I&#39;m sure it will always be one of his favorites too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, sentimental significance aside, I still believe it is objectively a great little set too. It looks awesome, goes together well, has a great color scheme, is infinitely swooshable, and with the little service cart alongside it, makes for great playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is not difficult at all, but because it was my son&#39;s first set (he was four years old at the time), that is a positive in my mind. It&#39;s not a boring or repetitive build by any means, it&#39;s just not challenging or didn&#39;t teach me any interesting building techniques or anything. The one challenge&nbsp;I remember was the stickers, at least the ones on the tail, simply because they were difficult to align, especially for a four year old. But the crooked tail stickers make&nbsp;this set that much more special and endearing to him (and me).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The included minifigures are nothing special, but adequate and fit the part of a pilot &amp; mechanic. Perfect for this set. Size and price of the set also make it ideal for kids&#39; toy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years I have purchased other small City planes and of course compared them to this one (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60144-1/Race-Plane"">60144 Race Plane</a>&nbsp;most closely resembles it to my eyes, even though it&#39;s a little smaller), but I will always consider this one superior. What I cannot figure out is if it is because this was truly a better set or simply because I&#39;ve elevated it to such a high regard due to it bringing me out of my dark ages. Either way, I think it&#39;s fantastic.</p>

<p>Overall, I love, Love, LOVE this set and will always remember it for the rest of my LEGO days. I&#39;m sure my son will too.&nbsp;</p>
