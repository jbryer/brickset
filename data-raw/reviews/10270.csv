<p>There are certain sets that as soon as you see them, you want them, and this was one&nbsp;such set&nbsp;for me. I&#39;m a sucker for 6-wide City trucks, as you&#39;ll know if you&#39;ve read any of my previous reviews of them.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=60020-1"" title=""View set details"">60020</a> is one of three sets in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=City&amp;subtheme=Cargo&amp;year=2013"">this year&#39;s Cargo theme</a>, the other two being a helicopter and a plane. It&#39;s similar in concept to <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7733-1"" title=""View set details"">7733</a> <em>Truck and Forklift </em>from 2008&#39;s Cargo sets, but much better executed in my opinion.</p>

<p>In the UK it costs &pound;25 and contains 321-pieces, making it a 7.7p a piece, which is low compared to many 2013 sets. It doesn&#39;t appear to be available in the USA yet, but I suspect it&#39;ll be in the region of $30-35.</p>

<h2>Box and contents</h2>

<p>The colourful front of the box sums up the action and fun to be had very well. The back amplifies it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9025663964/"" title=""60020 Cargo Truck by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""60020 Cargo Truck"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7388/9025663964_be9dc907da.jpg"" style=""height:472px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>Inside there are three numbered&nbsp;bags, two instruction books and one sticker sheet. Clearly&nbsp;adding a spare sheet, as I found in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=70706-1"" title=""View set details"">70706</a>,&nbsp;is not a common occurrence.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9023435757/"" title=""60020 Cargo Truck by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""60020 Cargo Truck"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8558/9023435757_e4e620abef.jpg"" style=""height:327px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>The set contains three figures, a forklift operator (centre), a truck driver (left) and a female worker. It&#39;s good to see the inclusion of a female figure. It&#39;s also good to see that health and safety is at last being taken seriously in&nbsp;LEGO City in that the forklift operator is wearing ear protection.</p>

<p>He&#39;s wearing a new cap, with a hole in the top, into which the new headphone/ear protectors fit.</p>

<h2>The forklift and pallets</h2>

<p>The forklift is a very nice design, making full use of the curved vehicle parts introduced for the Cars theme to good effect to give it a streamlined look. The actual fork lift uses parts that I believe first made an appearance in 2003, in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=4512-1"" title=""View set details"">4512</a> <em>Cargo Train. </em>One &#39;flaw&#39; is that because it&#39;s spring loaded with a rubber band, it can never be left in the lower position.</p>

<p>The pallets have interesting loads on them, some cylinders and an engine.</p>

<h2>The Truck</h2>

<p>The truck, which is a similar design to other six-wides,&nbsp;is built in three pieces. The chassis has some nice &#39;greebling&#39; on the sides. The exhaust stacks are better than usual, although probably a bit over-the-top for a vehicle of this size.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9023439989/"" title=""60020 Cargo Truck by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""60020 Cargo Truck"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7306/9023439989_159f879fb3.jpg"" style=""height:327px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, once assembled it looks great, even without the copious stickers applied, which is a big plus for me.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9025666208/"" title=""60020 Cargo Truck by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""60020 Cargo Truck"" src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8538/9025666208_ebb87fb5d1.jpg"" style=""height:307px; width:500px"" /></a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s the complete set showing how the inside of the truck is accessed. Not very prototypical, but necessary for play. If I was designing for myself, it I&#39;d dispense with the opening for the sake of realism.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/parts/?part=6038525"">white arches</a> on the side that&#39;s raised&nbsp;are new, appearing so far in white and black, in this set,&nbsp;and summer LotR sets.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>I was not disappointed with this set at all. The truck is&nbsp;well designed. Being in three parts it lends itself well to customisation. The forklift is the best looking one LEGO has made to date, thanks to the use of new curved parts. Together the models provide for a lot of fun for youngsters, or make an excellent display piece in your City or train&nbsp;layout. It&#39;s a shame LEGO didn&#39;t include some railway wagons as part of the cargo range...</p>

<ul>
	<li>Parts:&nbsp;5 -- plenty of generic parts.</li>
	<li>Building experience: 3 -- quick and easy, no surprises.</li>
	<li>Playability:&nbsp;4 -- hours of fun loading and unloading the truck!</li>
	<li>Value for money: 4 -- good price per piece, three minifigs.</li>
	<li>Overall: 5 -- can&#39;t be faulted!</li>

"ZooMotorPool","2015-06-24T12:04:53.613Z","A Decent Playful Box Truck Model for Truck Fans!","<p>Besides being a huge petrolhead, I am quite a truck fan. I play a lot of Euro Truck Simulator and many other heavy equipment simulation games. This has made me set my goal to collect all my hobby related-themed LEGOs for my next project. This truck is my first choice because it has been out since 2013 and it is getting rare, so I hunt it first.</p>

<p>This set is relatively expensive for what it is: a medium sized truck, a forklift, a couple of cargos in form of gas tanks and engine block, a trolley/pushcart, and 3 minifigures. But my desire is bigger, so I get them anyway. I really love the way LEGO design their models recently. The cab looks very realistic and almost toy-model-like. Yes, they seem to be more stud-phobia these days, but it is alright, the end product is what counts.</p>

<p><strong>Box</strong></p>

<p>The box is medium-sized, since it contains about 300 pieces. The new LEGO packaging begins to grow on me with this second set I get as an AFOL. It felt cheap compared to the old LEGO during the 1990 glory days, but this feels more exclusive.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>At the front, we get to see the what the whole set is offering after you finish building it, and at the back, you get all playing or displaying options, typical to modern LEGO boxes. For me, these pictures could be a reference on how to display this set. I like to work with LEGO display arrangements, and this set seems to have a lot to offer. Not bad.</p>

<p>The polybags and the instruction set, including the sticker sheet are let loose inside the box. In the old days, we were provided with the carton tray, which ironically still there in cheaper LEGO alteratives and knockoffs. Is this more environmentally friendly choice for the better product? Well, the box still pretty exclusive without it, so I concur.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with two instruction booklets. I expect it to be a coupon book sized with thick pages, but the booklet is pretty big. One of the main improvements in modern LEGO that I notice is how extremely newbie friendly the instructions are. Step-by-step, little things going on per each step, and plenty of insets to show you the detail.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>This is also the first time I met with modern LEGO minifigs. The instruction booklet no longer cover each of the minifigs in detail like they used to back in the days. They only show you how to build one of them, and let you figure out the rest, which were showcased in finished state.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I like the numbered Polybags, and they keep that small pieces inside with another polybags wrapping them. It helps you tidy your working space a lot. No more find Uncle Wally game with small specifically-coloured pieces anymore. Especially, goodbye to clueless polybag opening.</p>

<p>So I said during my review of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/48911"">LEGO 10242 Mini Cooper Mk.VII</a> set, I feel a lot of cheating going on with plenty of the new parts I&#39;ve seen in this set. Yes, after 17 years of not building a LEGO, this might seem confusing, but they are actually very predictable. The goal of the parts are pretty simple: to cover the finished model as much as possible with SNOTs and hide the studs with minimum effort.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of variety of parts in this set. If you are looking to stock unusual parts and pieces, this set has plenty of it.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>Included in the set are the three minifigures: the truck driver, forklift operator, and the female loadmaster, who seems to move the goods to the pallete.LEGO has balanced the gender issue by including female minifigures in every set possible. That is good.</p>

<p>Also, this is not my first time meeting the cap with ear protector worn by the forklift operator, the Shell LEGO sets have it too. Although I think he should have worn a helmet.</p>

<p>The new minifigures experessions are simply better, and the slightly less yellow colouring gives it more human-like appearance. There is more going on here than in the old sets, where some minifigures are just plainly there to assist playing. I used to name them all, my old minifigure sets. But these cracking new models, they make me feel that they have their own names. They look fabulous.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the build is pretty simple, since the instruction is pretty straight forward. Again, I am rushing from start to finish, if it wasn&#39;t for the annoying stickers.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>The forklift is pretty straight and quick. I noticed during the building that LEGO really really tried that hard to hide studs, they even give this forklift model a kind of &quot;side SNOT&quot;.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>For the truck itself, well, aligning this piece of big &quot;Cargo&quot; logo sticker takes me twice the amount of time to finish this set. That&#39;s my most memorable experience of the build. But the moment that I&#39;ve been waiting is to see the cab itself, which looks very decent, I love how the sloped 1x1 help gives it the final sleek looks.</p>

<p>Overall, despite the stickers, it is rather an enjoyable experience. The forklift is definitely the number one amazement point. The engine is the &quot;I didn&#39;t know LEGO can do that&quot; part of the building process.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>The forklift is indeed the best looking I&#39;ve ever seen. I never encountered LEGO forklifts before in my life, but this has to be one of the best that LEGO ever released. I really enjoy looking at it, its realistic shape and the colours to match. Sticker amount is moderate, and not much studs sticking out. Overall, a not so LEGO-like model. Clean, shaven, round, sleek. Helped a lot by cheating parts like the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4650977"">bowed 1 x 3 piece</a>, the single roof piece, and the round thing at the rear side. They use rubber band to hold the forks in place, that&#39;s quite cheating, but not bad for the looks.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>Honestly a gorgeous-looking truck. That 1x1 sloped tile really do the trick in giving it the modern streamlined front looks. It has plenty of turning signal lights on its sides, tastefully placed. The cabover roof is very much like most modern streamlined cabover trucks we seen today in Europe. The exhaust stack is a bit too much for a medium sized box truck like this. There is also some details going on in the fuel tank area. Lovely finish, now for the complaints.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>Modern LEGOs might look better, but they do have a lot of compromising gaps, because the use of this part, now the truck cab has a hidden gap here, carefully masked by the exhaust pipes. As an AFOL builder, I kind of miss the old LEGO &quot;tightness&quot;. This one is a major down for me.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>This too, the cargo box door mechanism also left quite a noticeable gaps on the roof. They really love to use the &quot;grabbing&quot; or &quot;holder&quot; pieces, don&#39;t they? Why don&#39;t they use the &quot;1x4 comb&quot; and its pairing? It left much less gap than this combination. I pretty much disdain the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4587212"">1x1 holder piece</a> (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/601902"">or any variants of it</a>), because they are the most fragile LEGO piece I ever know. Most of these pieces in my mixed bucket are either broken or mangled. And to think of the gap, wouldn&#39;t this make the cargo vulnerable from rain water? Realistic looking, but they seemed to unnecessarily sacrifice many visual aspects in order to give it more playability score.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;
<p>The set gives you pretty generous amount of variety: 3 minifigures with 3 different jobs and 3 different tools.</p>
</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>The driver is equipped with a walkie-talkie and a coffee mug in his truck dashboard. The loadmaster is to be given the trolley or the walkie talkie if you like. The forklift operator has his vehicle to toy around.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>The cab door opens (classic), the cargo box opens up at its left side, the pallete snug fits into the given space inside the box, and that&#39;s it for the truck. The pallete fits onto the the forklift nicely, the forklift rails tilts backward with a locking mechanism, the forklift roof opens so you can place or remove the minigifures easily. The trolley? Well the gas tanks can be removed and put onto the trolley, so you give the loadmaster something to do while on display.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>There are too many scenarios on how to display this set in the most imaginative way. Sadly, the forks of the forklift lack a lift locking mechanism, it either stays full up or full down (with the rubber band removed).</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I am not disappointed at all by the final looks. The truck indeed looks very good, so I got what I want. I enjoyed building the forklift the most, any LEGO sets with more than one model build is good enough to make me enjoy building it. This one has it.</p>

<p>Probably I won&#39;t enjoy playing it as much as I was back then, but if I were myself 17 years old back, I would probably be overjoyed seeing this decent-looking set in my collection armoire. This should be a great addition to every LEGO and trucking fans alike.</p>

"jmayo033","2017-01-09T17:44:45.287Z","A must for every Lego city","<p>This is my first review here. &nbsp;I have never written a Lego review before, but wanted to start the process. &nbsp;I also love this site and the reviews, so hopefully this will help someone out.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been eyeing this set for a couple years and failed to grab it when it was in stores. &nbsp;I finally started putting together my own Lego city last year and I had to grab this truck. &nbsp;Cargo trucks are a staple in every city. &nbsp;Their boxy frames and large footprint are always recognizable. &nbsp;To add to the legitimacy of my city, I knew this was a must.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The look and size of the cargo truck is outstanding. &nbsp;Towers over smaller cars in the city, which I love. &nbsp;It&#39;s long and the double tires in the back give it the added feel of a big box truck.</li>
	<li>The build of the fork lift is awesome. &nbsp;Very detailed with some great techniques. &nbsp;The orange and black color scheme looks sleek.</li>
	<li>3 minifigures is a solid haul.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>This is my first Lego forklift, so I&#39;m not sure if they are all like this, but the elastic is too taught. &nbsp;If you wanted to launch your cargo into orbit then it would work great. &nbsp;I think a newer fork lift design with better friction would be the way to go. &nbsp;Still good playability for kids.</li>
	<li>I&#39;m not a fan of the jean overalls body type&nbsp;of the two maintenance workers. &nbsp;Personal gripe, but feel they are better suited for a painter (Pet Shop Modular) or construction sets. &nbsp;I&#39;ll end up swapping them out for a driver in flannel print or something else more cliche.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are building your own Lego city or just buying for a child you can not go wrong with this set. &nbsp;I know Cargo sets are either part of larger sets or are one set releases, but I would love a Cargo subtheme. &nbsp;I had the Cargo Center from 1998 (6330) and absolutely loved that set. &nbsp;They could create an awesome upgrade for modern times.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out this review. &nbsp;Feedback is certainly welcome!</p>
