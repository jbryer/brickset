"Steinor","2013-11-08T23:29:20.017Z","Simple and fun build plane!","<p>Lego's take on the V22 Osprey! I am an AFOL who keep up with Lego planes, regardless of the themes where they come from. The 2013 City has some nice planes on the set, including this one. As I am used to build the bigger sets (modulars and UCS), this model is a very simple build, fast to assemble and as of the more recent Lego sets, very playable, as my 6 yo. daughter can tell you. The plane is sturdy and has big areas to hold it to play. The logs and the mini ATV is forgettable and a standard add-ons for these sets, I put mine away in a storage box.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Simple build</li><li>Details with the rotating propeller and engines</li><li>Very playable, big areas to hold the plane</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Mini add-ons not exactly adding value to the set</li><li>The hook at the bottom of the plane juts out too much</li><li>US$ 45 retail is a little bit too much for such a simple build</li></ul>
<p>Whether you are looking to gift or collect, this simple yet fun set is very good, the main downside for this set is the rather steep US$ 45</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,3

I received this as a holiday gift, and built it in about a half-hour, give-or-take. Pretty easy build, nothing fancy.</p><p><b>Pros</b></p>
<ul><li>Pretty realistic (looks like a V-22 Osprey)</li><li>Lots of playability</li><li>Not all that many stickers</li><li>Cool winch system</li><li>Lots of extra stuff (logs, a quad, people) to hoist up using the aforementioned cool winch system</li><li>Realistic(ish) molded cockpit piece and control surfaces</li><li>Can be relatively easily modified into another use (military, firefighting, passenger, et cetera)</li><li>Aft cargo ramp</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Too much wasted space</li><li>The V-22 Osprey is <i>supposed</i> to have two pilots and a flight engineer, and maybe a loadmaster, but all this can fit is a pilot (the same one that comes in the Cargo Terminal)</li><li>Nothing to put in the aft cargo hold ( I guess you could have one of the lumber workers with the cool earmuffs get kidnapped and thrown in there).</li></ul>
<p>All in all, not a bad set. It has some flaws, but anything can be fixed with a little&nbsp;modification. This is a great set for the younger ones, due to its simplicity, playability, and detail. Coupled with the Air Cargo plane from the Cargo Terminal set, you've got the start of your own little cargo fleet.</p><p>Hope you found this review helpful. Thanks for reading!</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4

"ZooMotorPool","2015-06-28T17:12:47.107Z","The Very Imaginative VTOL Cargo Plane","<p>My other hobby is aviation, although I&#39;ve been quite distant with my community lately, due to numerous issues and the general campiness of the atmosphere. But aeroplanes have been my fascination for year, it is my first true love, before everything else, including LEGO.</p>

<p>So why do I get this instead of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60022-1/Cargo-Terminal"">60022 Cargo Terminal</a>? Obviously because this model bears closer resemblance to the actual Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey than the 4-pod engined jet resembles the A340 or 707 or Dc-8 that they include in the Cargo Terminal set. It is a very easy choice, because it continues my Cargo-themed collection with <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/48943"">60020 Cargo Truck</a>. Why not? The only problem will be the woodlands setting of the timber industry scene that is included in this set.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>Box is as expected, slightly bigger than the Cargo Truck. It doesn&#39;t shy away from showing the right hand side of the plane, which where the unsightly knob is. You can rotate the knob to roll the on board crane. It is entirely for playability purposes but with some clever design so that it looks a bit like an electric motor.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>The box opens with pre-cut sections that you could press to open to its side, which is glued to the flaps. The Cargo Truck box is also designed similarly. It is messy, and I don&#39;t like it, but it is more secure. They could just tape it shut, but this method is more prone to tampering and could be messier.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>This set features 3 booklets. As with many modern LEGO series, it allows great team-building experience, in addition to the numbered polybags. Opening the polybags one-by-one itself is already a building experience that I would probably miss very soon. In the olden days, instruction booklets are bigger for a set of this size. They used to include only one booklet no matter how big the set is, and plethora of unnumbered polybags of stiffer material with numerous pores / breathing holes in it. There are no polybag inside a polybag like it is today.</p>

<p>The picture is very clear, the white and light-grey colour of the bricks can be easily identified, including the tricky dark grey ones. You have to flip over the unfinished &#39;Heliplane&#39; model a couple of times during the building process, and you have to be especially careful with the crane itself, because they still haven&#39;t show you how to properly tie it to the hook or how do they manage to slide the Technic piece into the roller while pinning the &#39;string&#39;.</p>

<p>My final gripe will be the misleading build instruction and the actual model being shown in the box.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>As you can see, the booklet instructs you to attach the main landing gears one stud inside the &#39;Heliplane&#39;s empenage, while in the box picture, it clearly shows that the main landing gears should be at the end corner of the empenage. I&#39;d go for the box picture one, because it looks better.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set also features great amount of variety. Many are new to me. But some were re-introduced into different function like this <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4565432"">stack with connector</a>. This was the exhaust pipe of the previous Cargo Truck after minor additions. Now it is part of a log palete.</p>

<p>Sadly, there were not so many coloured transparent pieces, indicating that LEGO still haven&#39;t cope with realistic aeroplane lighting regulations, despite their effort to make their finished model as smooth as possible.</p>

<p>We have the nose section of the aircraft made entirely from one piece, but the glass section is separated for us to assemble. This includes the age old &#39;window&#39; pieces, which glass part, I feel a bit loose in this modern set. The glass in the windows of the older LEGOs stay fixed in place, they also didn&#39;t come in disassembled form.</p>

<p>One thing worth noting is the modern LEGO control panel for an aircraft, which also improved quite immensely from my era. This <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4288083"">sloped &quot;roof tile&quot;</a> now features more sensible instruments like artificial horizon (part of the ADI - Attitude &amp; Direction Indicator), which is sneakily combined with the HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator) navigation instrument. I don&#39;t think it is allowed, but hey, it is neat. A throttle lever, two dial indicators (probably for engines) below the ADI-HSI combination instrument, an MCP at the top right, and some backup analog instruments (middle bottom, probably Air Speed Indicator or Altimetre) with some indicator lights. No longer it features senseless button mashing and heaps of randomness like in previous panels.</p>

<p>There is also plenty of stickers for the Heliplane, and also a polystring.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>They include 3 minifigures here. A pilot and two lumberjacks. One lumberjack supposed to have the chainsaw, while the other is a relaxed man holding a coffee mug. Oh, there is a German Shepherd-like dog too.</p>

<p>Both of the timber workers used safety headgears, which is great. The pliot looks pretty stylish too with his shiny sunglasses. Like every LEGO planes ever, it flies with only one crew: the pilot and nobody else.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Stacking the log pieces is not as tedious as it seems. It caused a bit of panic when one or two pieces are suspected to be missing. But in the end, all pieces are accounted for.</p>

<p>The Heliplane itself has a lot of things happening in them, but sadly not too much, since it is a cargo hauler. So, they use a lot of 1-width bricks and plenty of 2-width bricks as well, making this model quite heavy when finished. I enjoyed assembling the fuselage and seeing the first glance of the semi-finished model. It does bear some resemblance to the actual V-22 Osprey!</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>The nose landing gear technique is also new to me, but it does look neat. I like the taxi lights, very realistic.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>LEGO also tried their best to recreate the plane&#39;s wing empenage, and I think it is pretty decent already.</p>

<p>As always, the crane build is a bit tricky, especially on how to attach the polystring into the roller itself. Instead of tying a knot, we should be sliding a technical piece and pinch the end of the polystring dead inside the roller (which is a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4211370"">drum holder piece</a>) and the holed 1x2 brick wall.</p>

<p>Engine build is very satisfying experience, as the engine is quite massive and tiltable (independently).</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>Overall, the finished model looks great, if you followed the instruction. But the main landing gear will soon be your number one OCD trigger. Yes, it is wrong indeed.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>It looks rather great, with the big help of that single pre-fab helicopter nose piece. The tail feels a bit too small, and as confirmed from the picture of the real aircraft. The tail actually protrudes to the bottom, so the tail fins are actually attached to the elevator body, instead of the tail fins sitting on it.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>So I added these 1x2 reverse slope brick and another 1x2 brick to make to the bottom of the tail fin, in order to make it looks closer to the real V-22 Osprey.</p>

<p>&lt;picture</p>

<p>The ATV looks very big for the size (it has truck-sized wheels), but on its own, it feels very real.</p>

<p>LEGO may tried its best to make the finished model sleek. But the wings are so full of studs. There is so much space that a SNOT piece can cover, but not this one though. Well, I don&#39;t care about studs. It is a LEGO model anyway, so why should we care?</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Playability is probably number one or number two concerns of modern LEGO designers. Surely, it involves a lot of creativity to design this set, so you can have a Heliplane full of playable features: opening rear cargo ramp, tilting rotor engines (independently, with that modern LEGO locking mechanism), rotating propeller blades (it&#39;s old, but still good to see), a hook crane that features a knob to extend or retract the crane, and rotating nose landing gear (which never settles, albeit less annoying than in the older LEGOs).</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>The Heliplane itself has a rather small cargo space and cramped cockpit space that only allows another minifig inside.</p>

<p>&lt;picture&gt;</p>

<p>Moving out from Heliplane, we have 5 x 8-stack logs, a log grabber (could be a tractor/utility vehicle implement), an ATV, plenty of tools (circular saw, axe, chainsaw, a chain), a log stacking palete, and a coffee mug. It leaves so many options and plenty of storytelling possibilities for display.</p>

<p>As the pictorial gallery on the box suggests, you can either have the lumberjacks waiting for their ATV or equipments to be airlifted into their working site, having a log delivered to some expectant (by a gas-hungry VTOL plane, which doesn&#39;t make economic sense), or having a Heliplane randomly hovering above them while they are busy dragging a log to chopping station using ATV (tied to the log with the chain). I like this set a lot from this playability aspect alone.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The 6-studs wide LEGO models in recent years have been a major attraction for me to go back into collecting LEGOs after 17 years. The trucks, the vehicles, the planes, the helicopters. Why can&#39;t the minifigs sit side-by-side just like in the real world? Nevertheless, every model looks way better now, 4-studs wide are just plainly odd. It used to be some kind of novelty where you can put a minifigure inside. Then, it just doesn&#39;t scale well with the minifigures.</p>

<p>However, the novelty soon wears down a bit after you couldn&#39;t make sense of where to put this set on your collection display. The only possible scenario will be to combine this with the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60059-1/Logging-Truck"">60059 Logging Truck set</a> because that set has the same minifigs with this set. Another a bit stretching scenario would be combining this with &quot;Forest Police&quot; theme. No matter how far you think about it, this is still a &quot;Cargo&quot; themed sets. So close, yet so far.</p>

<p>This set now rests with my other &quot;Forest&quot;-themed collection like the Logging Truck, and 2014 <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60057-1/Camper-Van"">60057 Camper Van set</a>, displayed in a setting of some forest with a lake. Probably, LEGO never intended this set to be in any way, integrated with other Cargo sets, like the truck and the terminal. Yeah, I get it, the cargo terminal is an airport, and usually located near the greens. But it doesn&#39;t allow any other scenario for display. This is probably an integrator set, LEGO is planning a timber, lumberjacking action sets in the future. But don&#39;t get your hopes high yet.</p>

<p>As for now, I think this set is good, model quality-wise and from the playability perspective. But as a collection of a theme, this set is still off in uncharted territory. It is also expensive as well, being in the premium price for a generally 500-600ish pieces set. If you like aeroplanes, I think you don&#39;t want to miss this set. But if you have other pressing matters, you may need to think twice before skipping this one, because who knows about LEGO might releasing forestry / logging / timber / lumberjack theme in the future?</p>
