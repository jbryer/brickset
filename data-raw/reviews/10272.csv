"Mind2000","2013-07-06T07:31:35.72Z","Wow What an amazing set.....","This review is for the Lego city set 60011 surfer rescue. This set costs Â£4.99 here in the uk and it includes 2 minifigures. When you first see the box you will like the set and might pick it up but until you build it you really don't realise how amazing it actually is. When you open up the box you have 2 bags the manual , the shark and the stickers and still you don't realise how amazing this set is. The build is very easy and took me 4 minutes to build. The set overall :<div><br></div><div>Minifigures :</div><div>The minifigures in this set are very nice for city mini figures and I especially like the wet suit on the surfer , the coast guard is like all the other coast guard mini figures and looks really nice. There is only one problem that sort of annoys me about the figures it's the fact that the life jacket sticks up so there head doesn't go on properly , it's secure but doesn't really look very good unless the figures , like this one , has a helmet.</div><div><br></div><div>Accessories :</div><div>The 2 accessories in this set are a shark and a surfboard I love both of these accessories very much and I think that the detail on them is great.</div><div><br></div><div>The boat :</div><div>The boat is very chunky but it looks great and very realistic and I love all the stickers , the figure can fit on it really nice holding the handle bars</div><div><br></div><div>Overall I think this is a great set and is the best value for money set this year , and even Though this is a small set it has so much play value for Kids so I give it a 5/5 overall. This is a great set and thank you for reading my review on it.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Coson","2013-07-10T16:42:43.19Z","Set 60011: Surfer rescue","<p>This set is one of those impulse sets where you see it in the Lego isle, like the look of it, and pick it up. Which is exactly what I did. So read on to find out if this set&nbsp;is worth picking up on short-term notice or if you should ignore it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Since this is the smallest set in this years wave of Coast Guard (excluding polybags) it obviously comes in a small box. The box has some nice detail and shows the shark swimming towards the surfer with the Coast Guard on his jet ski zooming in to save him. In the background you will see a city and a beach. On the&nbsp;back of the box a similar picture only this time the surfer is in the water and the Coast Guard is throwing a buoy to him.</p><p>The instructions were fine and I had no missing pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The 32 parts in this set were packed in one bag even though the last reviewer said that they were in two. (probably just a US, UK thing.)&nbsp;This set has a lot of noteworthy parts, particularly the&nbsp;minifig torsos, the surfboard, the shark, the lifejacket, and the&nbsp;2x4 plate with bow.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are two minifigs included in this set the first of which the <strong>Coast Guard, </strong>is packed with detail. His torso is light 'bley' and has some buttons, pockets, a collar, and a belt printed on. Over his left pocket is a Coast guard badge. This figure also has some back printing which is some creases and a continuation of the collar and belt. Over his torso you can&nbsp;put a lifejacket&nbsp;on, which is the same as&nbsp;the 2011 one so I won't go into any detail. His legs are plain blue and have no printing which is a shame. His head is a generic&nbsp;head with sunglasses and a smile. Over his head is a standard racer helmet.</p><p>My favorite minifig in this set&nbsp;is in fact&nbsp;the <strong>Surfe</strong>r. He has&nbsp;a black wetsuit with some blue highlights and some muscle definition. His  chest&nbsp;has an Iron Man style circle with a wave printed&nbsp;in it. His&nbsp;back also has some printing which is some more blue highlights and a zipper down the middle.&nbsp;As with the Coast&nbsp;Guard his legs have no printing and are plain black. His head has a smirk and no glasses. His hair is the same as Obi-Wan Kenobi's from the&nbsp;Republic&nbsp;Gunship (set 75021).&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very simple and takes about five minutes and uses no special&nbsp;techniques.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is very good and is good fun to play with. This would also be a great set for a display. The shark also adds to the playability. This would also go great with one of larger sets of this wave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I would definitely recommend you to get&nbsp;this set.&nbsp;Not only is it small and therefore easy to buy on short-term notice also with the playability AND display ability, this set totally earns an...</p><p>Overall of 5/5</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Squidtron","2013-12-28T22:34:32.583Z","A Good Supplement","<h4>Pieces</h4><p>Despite its small size, the boat is not entirely devoid of interesting pieces. It's pieces are mostly standard, but the sleek brick streamlining the top is a new piece to me. I think that it would be helpful for streamlining white creations, as would the 2 x 1 cheese slope-like part also included. One slight disappointment in this set was the orange. Though a minor part, due to orange being the secondary color of Mars Mission and Power Miners sets, as well as some of the galaxy squad sets, I have more orange pieces than I know what to do with, especially because I don't build in that color so much. Anyway, that's just a minor gripe. The pieces on the speedboat are fairly good considering the simplicity of the set. <br></p><p>My favorite part is, of course, the shark. Never having had a Lego shark before, this little set was an excellent way for me to get one. Though not useful for anything but being a shark, when you need a Lego shark, there is no replacement (which lead me to never building something needing a shark before). The life jacket and the surfboard were also good. Taken as a whole, the pieces make a perfect addition to oceanside scenes.<br></p><h4>Minifigures</h4>The minifigures are well done for city minifigs. The coast guard minifigure is nice because the pieces are all fairly generic and could be used in a variety of ways. There is a small coast guard icon on&nbsp; his badge, but it it not very noticeable, so the torso could be used for a policeman if you didn't have an authentic policeman torso handy. The face, pants, and helmet of this figure are nothing special (though it is nice that the face is not double sided).<br>The surfer minifig is pretty good too, though his torso is not as versatile due to the zipper on the back. However, it does make an excellent wetsuit if you ever have need of one. Like the other minifig, the face and pants are not too exciting. The hair is nice because it could be used either as long male hair or short female hair and not look unusual.<br><h4>Build</h4><p>The build is very straightforward and uninteresting, though that's no surprise for an impulse set.<br></p><h4>Final Product</h4><p>The shark is the thing that makes this set work. It is actually surprisingly fun to play with. One can get endless fun from chasing the minifigures around with the shark, or use it to attack your other Lego sets.<br></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>To sum up, this set is fun, simple, and decent MOCfodder. I think $6.99 might be a little expensive for this set, a Lego shark is really a must have for any MOCist.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,2
"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:50:02.033Z","Rescue the Surfer.","<p><strong>Set # 60011 Surfer Rescue: </strong>Here&rsquo;s another small LEGO City set, one that is an interesting little set, though perhaps not necessarily a must have if you missed it on the first go round, especially as it is now three years old and definitely off the market in most retail environments. Still this is a review, so we&rsquo;ll discuss the elements of the set that stand out and the ones that don&rsquo;t quite work out and hopefully it will help make a decision.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: This is a rather unusual choice, ordinarily a set with 32 pieces would be kept for a Polybag set, however LEGO sometimes does include boxed LEGO City sets this small. And the box design is your standard LEGO City box design. The back is a fun looking action scene for the set, while the front showcases the contents aptly.</p>

<p>Instructions: This manual is a bit larger than I&rsquo;d expect in such a small set. It shows a quick and easy build step-by-step with a parts list in back and a picture of all the sets. It should also be noted that this set uses stickers, really for a set this size not featuring printed elements is a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Coast Guard Rescuer: A standard looking Minifigure from LEGO City, he has a double-sided torso with printed detailing and a single-sided face with mirrored shades that I think we&rsquo;ve seen on other characters, Police, Firefighters or Coast Guard Rescuers.</p>

<p>Male Surfer: Wearing a wet suit, this Minifigure stands out as the better of the pair from the sets, wearing a double-sided torso with wet suit printing including a logo for LEGO City aquatic exploration or something. He&rsquo;s got a standard single-sided expression as well, which is unfortunate, as a double-sided face with scared expression would have looked better in escaping the shark. He&rsquo;s also using Thor&rsquo;s hair piece in light brown colouring.</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>This model doesn&rsquo;t have much to talk about, it&rsquo;s pretty much a small jetski, designed to fit one person it doesn&rsquo;t help much for rescuing somebody else. Though it does include a life preserver, a surfboard and a shark, so perhaps it makes up a bit for the lackluster build. Especially considering the jetski includes stickers for details, the coast guard logo is a sticker instead of a printed element and the surfboard uses a sticker for extra details. A real shame as we&rsquo;ve seen this piece printed numerous times before in the CMF line where it originated from.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Should you still be able to locate this set in stores I&rsquo;d say try and pick it up. It is a tad on the weaker side as there isn&rsquo;t much unique here, it would have been nice to see the newer LEGO Shark used instead of the old fashioned version, however the Surfer Minifigure is great for MOC fans for a beach display and you can never have too few coast guards. I&rsquo;d say if you can&rsquo;t still find it though it&rsquo;s definitely safe to skip, it doesn&rsquo;t offer much and the use of stickers for details instead of printing in such a small set is seriously disappointing. Mildly recommended.</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-02-01T19:23:22.737Z","JUMPING THE SHARK!","<p>Hello, fellow Bricksetters! PicnicBasketSam here, reviewing the smallest Coast Guard set for your reading pleasure. Does it stack up to expectations set high by the 2008 CG line? Or does it dismally fail as just another overpriced stocking stuffer?</p>

<p>BOX/INSTRUCTIONS<br />
The box is standard $5-$7 size. The instructions are stupendously short and have no piece call-outs, but as the set has so few parts, I was able to build it without them. When the box opens, out falls instructions, a tiny bag of parts, and a worryingly big sticker sheet.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES<br />
This set has an amazing three figures, if you count the shark, which I don&#39;t. We will discuss the shark later. One figure is the coast guard worker, who looks rather like a police officer with a life jacket that exposes an gap in his neck... which I hate. The surfer is wearing a very nice wetsuit, complete with zipper, and has Ep2 Obi-Wan hair. He has a surfboard, which unfortunately has a big sticker on it that doesn&#39;t match the color of the plastic.</p>

<p>PARTS<br />
This set is all about one thing: the new shark. The 30 other parts in the set are pretty much worthless. There are a couple of orange tiles and surfboard, but that&#39;s pushing it. The shark uses the old head mold, but now features gills and redesigned attachment points so that it can sit flat on a plate. I think the tail is also a different shape.</p>

<p>COMPLETED MODEL<br />
The only thing actually built in the set is a jetski. It looks very coast guard-ish, but all the detail is provided by three big stickers. It&#39;s very sturdy apart from the life preserver, so there is that. All the components of the set together form a cohesive scene: surfer gets attacked by shark, jet ski swoops in and saves him. Simple and sweet. Very playable too!</p>

<p>CONCLUSION<br />
Surfer Rescue is a very fine little set. Cheap, playable, and shark-infested, it has all the hallmarks of a good stocking stuffer. It is not without its faults, however-- the stickers are a big blow, and the price is terrible. USD $7 for 32 pieces is 21 cents per piece, and that is generally a very bad deal. Everywhere else, it&#39;s highway robbery. So I&#39;m giving this a 3.5/5 stars, taking off 1 for stickers and 1.5 for price. Since the star increments don&#39;t go in halves, the final score is 4 out of 5. Get it if you can still find it-- this set came out almost 2 years ago and the price is still swallowable.</p>
