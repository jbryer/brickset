<p>This is a really nice set.&nbsp; I acquired it several years ago, when it was released, and now realized that I should write a review on it.&nbsp; This is a very nice set.&nbsp; There is a very clear story element behind this set, with a clear intent of rescuing the poor people who crashed their boat into a lighthouse (how that would happen is beyond me, but still).&nbsp; The lighthouse is built quite simply while still being obviously recognizable as one.&nbsp; The small green boat is nice, although it is a bit lacking in detail.</p>

<p>The star of the set is the Coast Guard cutter.&nbsp; This is a very nice-looking ship which also has a detailed bridge.&nbsp; Since there is so much to say, I will simply give a list of pros and cons below.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>This ship looks great with the stickers included in the set.</p>

<p>The helicopter, while very small, is still quite swooshable (I love saying that word).</p>

<p>The bridge superstructure looks&nbsp;<em>amazing</em>&nbsp;with those angled windows.&nbsp; There is a good minifigure selection, as well as a dog, 3 sharks, and a crab.</p>

<p>I love the little radar array on the top of the Coast Guard vessel.</p>

<p>The set comes with 2 &quot;floaty boat&quot; hulls.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: &quot;museo slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Cons:</span></h3>

<p>The helicopter has a very limited landing space, and when onboard the ship, obscures the view forward from the bridge (so the Coast Guard may well run into that same lighthouse because they can&#39;t see).</p>

<p>Other than the bridge, there is no interior to the ship, only a low crawlspace under the bridge.</p>

<p>There is no lifeboat/small rescue boat included in the set.</p>

<p>The mini ROV (remotely operated vehicle, the minisub thing) seems kind of irrelevant to the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Modifications:</h3>

<p>Recently, to rectify these problems, I have modified this set using miscellaneous pieces.&nbsp; NOTE: If all you are looking for is info about the set, feel free to stop reading here.&nbsp; Or read on, if you like.</p>

<p>Anyways, I have added parts from several sets, as well as some generic elements that I had lying around.&nbsp; I moved the helipad to the back and elevated it above the deck using an 8x8 octagon-shaped plate, as well as adding a relatively detailed lower deck under the superstructure.&nbsp; I built an engine room towards the back, as well as a small bunkroom (small as in one bed) forward.&nbsp; This also allows access from the front of the vessel to the back, a big plus.&nbsp; For a smaller modification, I moved the minisub&nbsp;davit (or crane, whatever) to the front and mounted the small boat from 60012 Coast Guard 4x4 and Diving Boat on the conveniently located clip.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s about all that I have to say, so thanks for taking the time to read my review of 60014 Coast Guard Patrol!</p>
