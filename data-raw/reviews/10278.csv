But after seeing the Town Square, I knew this would be a set I would really like. I am pleased to say, I was right - it is a fantastic set.</p><p>For starters, Lego do seem to have cut down the box sizes, this one in particular has alot more depth to it, and certainly is in a smaller box than I would have expected were it released a couple of years ago, but it&nbsp;doesn't disappoint. </p><p>Inside the box you have 10 bags, numbered 1-9 plus an&nbsp;extra bag for the larger parts (large plates, glass windows&nbsp;for the Pizzeria and the yellow arm for the crane). There are 5 instruction manuals altogether, all dealing with different sections of the&nbsp;Town Square:</p><p>Manual 1 deals with Bag 1 - the road sweeper with figure, Statue and the boy with skateboard and dog&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Manual 2 deals with bags 2 and 3 - the red single-decker bus with bus driver</p><p>Manual 3 deals with bags 4 and 5 - Pizzeria with chef and 2 customers</p><p>Manual 4 deals with bags 6 and 7 - Bike Shop with figure</p><p>Manual 5 deals with bags 8 and 9 - construction crane with driver</p><p>The build overall is not difficult but some of the aspects are great, the bus has utilized the passenger space well whilst not crowding it with seats - each figure has enough room and the seats aren't too close together. The set generally feels more spacious than the 'City Corner' counterpart and once it is built it is easy to see the good value for money.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Set generally feels quite roomy - not confined to baseplates and 4 walls</li><li>The bus is very well designed, not crammed with seats and figures have a good amount of room around them</li><li>Glass pieces for the Pizzeria make it more appealing to the eye, rather than smaller windows with a large roof</li><li>Set&nbsp;gives you space&nbsp;to add your own buildings and expand the&nbsp;town square.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>£80 isn't too bad a price, certainly better value below £70</li><li>Many stickers, some are awkward to apply due to how thin they are, difficult to get them to look right.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to sum up, the set itself is generally very appealing, certainly more to it than the pictures let on. Some of the stickers are difficult to apply, which I know will annoy some people (myself included). But that matter aside, it is definitely a set I would recommend to those who like the idea of a miniature Town Square or who view City Corner as a bit too cramped for their liking.</p><p>Overall an excellent set, one worth buying and building.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"soltrdc","2013-08-12T02:53:57.68Z","Great set with playability and display value","<p>I bought this set as part of expanding my City scene and I was not disappointed! Here in Singapore it has a RRP of S$179.90, but I got it at a discounted price of $124.90.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is very appealing and definitely adds towards the desirability of the set. The colorful buildings and vehicles arranged as a scene of the Town Square makes the set very attractive to the eye. On the back, more scenarios are depicted.</p><p><span><span>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7399/9427442549_91a1ca2c1e.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></p><p><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7410/9427444331_4f4a02ccf0.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><br></span></span></span></span></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Coming out of the box are 9 bags of parts and 5 instruction booklets. I can't comment much on the parts as I don't do MOCs, but in general I felt it was a nice collection which would be useful for any city-themed building. Particularly nice are the inclusion of 2 bicycles and 2 motorbikes, along with some minifig bodies and helmets as part of the bike shop display. There is also the sticker sheet and some string for the crane.</p><p><span><span>[img]http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5346/9427446937_d0bc372079.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>This set comes with 8 minifig people - the bike shop owner, crane driver, road sweeper operator, bus driver, a couple, the chef and a skateboarding kid. There is also a dog added in for a total of 9 figures. Theres 10 if you count the grey ""statue"" as a minifig as well (he has all the minifig parts except nothing is printed on him at all). All in all, that's a good number of minifigs that enable good playability of the set as well as to add to the Lego citizenry of my city!</p><p><span><span>[img]http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/9430217270_e8d71484ef.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>IMO, one of the most fun part of the set is the build! I took slightly over 3 hours to build all of the 914 pieces, which was longer than I expected, since I completed the PotC Black Pearl (804 pieces) in just over 2 hours. It was fun putting together the different components of the set. In all, the 5 parts consist of the road sweeper + statue, the bus, the pizza shop, the bike shop and the crane. The bus and bike shop probably took me the longest and were the most interesting parts, followed by the crane. The pizza shop was pretty straightforward to build and wasn't that fun compared to the other parts, but still pretty decent in itself. In the bike shop, there are some interesting techniques to allow for the wall-mounted bicycles and the arrangement of the two-storey shop layout. The second storey has a really nice checkered-tiled floor! I got a bit tired towards the end but all in all it was a great building experience, sure to fulfil anyone's desire to fix lego bricks together!</p><p><span><span>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/9427450913_c9e50b4684_n.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></p><p><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/9430222392_35eb00bd14_n.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3807/9427454587_30de970a90_n.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7439/9430226576_638e76ba20_n.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is really pretty, with vibrant colors (lime green! orange! yellow! trans-blue! red! black! white!). One can arrange the buildings/vehicles as part of the intended Town Square scene, or as part of a larger town scene. This means that in itself it is great to play with, and it can also add playability to an extended scenario, which adds much flexibility to the set. The dimensions of the buildings are good and details on the models are decent as well, especially in the bike shop. There's a nice addition of red-and-green flags on the buildings to make them look more decked out.&nbsp;</p><p>The color schemes of the vehicles look really nice. Red and black for the bus, and the usual yellow and black for the crane, which looks really great when put together with the other parts of the set.&nbsp;</p><p><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5350/9427451909_fa7465a081_n.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></p><p><span><span>[img]http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5321/9430228270_4fd3c94dd5_n.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></p><p>The road sweeper and statue are basically the ""adornments"" of the set, which work well on their own but add in more color and scene-making possibilities to the set. Similarly the skateboard kid and dog.&nbsp;</p><p>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7404/9427461191_85675e458c.jpg[/img]</p><p><span><span><span><span>The pizzeria looks really good with a lime-green and white color theme, together with trans-blue glass facade. It has indoor and bistro sitting and space for 2 couples. One chef works the oven and I guess he must be busy because he has to wait tables and the cash register too. Two dustbins ""decorate"" the side of the building, one with a fish sticking out. Fish pizza, anyone?</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2858/9430230642_e0701a391a.jpg[/img]</span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7417/9430235460_a5955bd5f8.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The bike shop is probably the highlight of the set. A really nice two-storey building with nice full length trans-blue windows, orange and black tiling on the second storey and an interior chock full of biking equipment. The sole store operator will have a lot to do to keep the store in order!</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7313/9430224258_ae1b98ac1a.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7389/9430234538_59fa9f78d8.jpg[/img]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>For S$124.90, I got a set that is visually appealing, satisfying to build and also fun to play. The best part of the set is that it adds to any Lego City, be it small or large. For a small city, this set would add a few very nice ""anchor"" buildings and useful vehicles. For a large city, well, one could always do with more shops and vehicles! Definitely worth getting, especially on a discount!</p><p>[img]http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3677/9427463649_d593f4da03.jpg[/img]</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
