"Tediousity","2016-12-17T19:09:29.023Z","Quite good, actually","<p>All right, let&#39;s go through this day by day.</p>

<p>1. Nice little astromech using the non-domed head piece. He&#39;s orange, to contrast with my billions of R2s.</p>

<p>2. I believe this is the Solar Sailer&nbsp;(<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7752-1/Count-Dooku-s-Solar-Sailer"">http://brickset.com/sets/7752-1/Count-Dooku-s-Solar-Sailer</a>) in miniature form, in which case, it&#39;s not bad! The dishes on the sides are a little weird though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3. This is, I think, Dooku&#39;s&nbsp;pilot droid. It&#39;s a pretty little droid.</p>

<p>4. Zam Wesell&#39;s starfighter is a little disproportionate in this build, but it&#39;s still a good likeness.</p>

<p>5. The twin-pod cloud car is always fun, and this is a nice build for it, while still small.</p>

<p>6. The Endor&nbsp;rebel trooper is well-detailed with a double-sided head. He has back printing and that beautiful helmet mold.</p>

<p>7. And now, a weapons rack. This one isn&#39;t actually <em>too</em> bad though, with a sleek spaceship-style build and 3 blasters of different sizes, to equip the Endor soldier and...Dooku&#39;s droid with?</p>

<p>8. A pretty Republic Gunship which I think is exactly identical to one from another calendar. Still nice though.</p>

<p>9. I think this is a Star Destroyer, but it&#39;s kind of a weird one. It&#39;s got too much space at the back, by a lot.</p>

<p>10. At last, someone else who needs a blaster! This clone trooper is remarkably detailed, but none on the legs.</p>

<p>11. Somehow they managed to squeeze six legs onto this AT-TE and it looks quite good!</p>

<p>12. This Republic Dropship is kind of big, really. It&#39;s also a little simplistic, but it gets the job done. If you really want, it can be attached to the AT-TE.</p>

<p>13. Oh boy! A battle droid. Same old, same old.</p>

<p>14. This appears to be a clumsy Geonosian Starfighter, fitting in with the Geonosian theme. It&#39;s a bit funny-looking.</p>

<p>15. Today we have a beautiful Geonosian, but sadly no wings on &#39;em.&nbsp;</p>

<p>16. We were all hoping...and yes! Another weapons rack! What joy. This one has another blaster, presumably for the battle droid, and some weird blaster thing for the Geonosian.</p>

<p>17. I admit readily I don&#39;t know what this is. Does a good job of being it, though!</p>

<p>18. Finally someone to fight the Endor trooper!&nbsp;This beauty is a wonderful Scout Trooper, with a face in a sleeve and a torso matching up with the legs. He also appears to have another helmet (?) printed on his back.</p>

<p>19. Here we have what I believe to be a Separatist ship in blue. It&#39;s a little odd because the curves are approximated with cheese slopes, but it doesn&#39;t look too bad.</p>

<p>20. This is&nbsp;Obi-Wan&#39;s Jedi Starfighter, looking quite good in my opinion.</p>

<p>21. On the solstice we get Slave I: that is, Jango Fett&#39;s Slave I. It looks wonderful.</p>

<p>22. Right here is Boba&nbsp;Fett (as a kid): a sizable improvement from the earlier one!</p>

<p>23. The penultimate day gives us some sort of jet-powered sleigh: a little odd, but a good ride for...</p>

<p>24. Our Santa Claus! Or Kris Kringle, etc. He is Jango Fett here, with 3 presents (1x2 tiles). The instructions claim they all fit in the sack, while really only 2 can. That said, he&#39;s got a beautiful torso with a little fuzz out the top, and some holly pinned to his chest. It&#39;s entirely red, and he&#39;s got a couple tiny presents strapped to his belt.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>A nice calendar here, with the standouts for me being the scout trooper, astromech, and (for some weird reason) the dropship and AT-TE.</p>

<p>All in all, lovely!</p>

"Timosaurus","2017-04-04T10:19:49.753Z","Really really good","<p>The entire days in December got a surprise when I bought this. Everyday, I open the small window and build those small ships and minifigures. I spent the rest of my free time playing with them. These builds are small, so they don&#39;t take up a lot of space, but they are really fun to play with!</p>

<p>Please note that these are not in order of release.</p>

<p>1. Geonosian&nbsp;ship- possibly&nbsp;Count&nbsp;Dooku&#39;s ship. The wings are nice and it captures that sleek look. 4</p>

<p>2.&nbsp;Slave I- Jango&nbsp;Fett&#39;s&nbsp;renowned bounty hunter&nbsp;ship is captured&nbsp;in microscale&nbsp;form. I wish there were a few more blue pieces. 4</p>

<p>3. Republic Gunship- a&nbsp;crisp model of an amazing&nbsp;and iconic ship. The flag wings are really cool and just the fact that half of it is built sideways. 5</p>

<p>4. Twin-Pod Cloud&nbsp;Car- this is&nbsp;the&nbsp;Cloud City fighter in a&nbsp;festive&nbsp;red. It still has the tradition two wings, two cockpits but only 1 engine. 4</p>

<p>5. J-type diplomatic&nbsp;barge- Padm&eacute; is seen in one of these in the Clone Wars. The model is all grey apart from the cockpit which is translucent. The shape and structure is amazing. 5</p>

<p>6. Scout Trooper- he is the&nbsp;normal scout trooper&nbsp;with a mostly&nbsp;black&nbsp;head piece with a small head. The arms and legs are printed black along with some of the torso. 4</p>

<p>7. Blue weapons rack- includes&nbsp;3 weapons: a blaster pistol, a blaster&nbsp;rifle and a&nbsp;blaster. It uses some grey pieces too. 3</p>

<p>8. Brown weapons rack- includes&nbsp;2 weapons: a&nbsp;blaster and a Geonosian&nbsp;ray gun. It has a pointed shape. Made of mostly brown pieces. 2</p>

<p>9. Young Boba&nbsp;Fett- he wears a blue&nbsp;shirt with&nbsp;creases and&nbsp;has unfoldable short legs. This is him on Kamino in &#39;Attack of the Clones&#39;. He has an innocent expression and then a cruel smile on the other side. Might&#39;ve been nice to get him with his Father&#39;s Mandalorian helmet. 5</p>

<p>10. Jango&nbsp;Fett- he has his traditional&nbsp;Mandalorian&nbsp;armour in&nbsp;red. He has red legs and the normal Mandalorian helmet. He comes with a sack with two presents/letters inside. No. 24! 4</p>

<p>11. Geonosian- he is the normal Geonosian&nbsp;with the cool head and&nbsp;printing. 3</p>

<p>12. Battle Droid- yep, the&nbsp;bogstandard&nbsp;one. Nothing special about this guy. 1</p>

<p>13. Star Destroyer- the Star&nbsp;Destroyer is very out of scale and the&nbsp;bridge is not represented well&nbsp;by the clip. 3</p>

<p>14. Sleigh- very nice brown&nbsp;looking model. It has Jango&#39;s&nbsp;jetpack fitted on the back. Might&#39;ve been better with lightsabers to form the main structure. 4</p>

<p>15. Clone- a normal clone trooper. 3</p>

<p>16. Jedi star&nbsp;fighter- nice&nbsp;maroon&nbsp;wings and a good&nbsp;cockpit. Very festive and colourful. 4</p>

<p>17. Republic Dropship- a nice&nbsp;carrier ship&nbsp;but a bit too simple. 3</p>

<p>18. AT-TE- this Walker looks amazing with&nbsp;six&nbsp;tap&nbsp;legs&nbsp;and a big gun on top. It can be attached to the Dropship. 5</p>

<p>19. Zam Wessel&#39;s&nbsp;ship- anyone remember the changeling&nbsp;assassin at the start of Episode&nbsp;2? Her ships&nbsp;back. The engines are a little out of proportion but the structure is great. 4</p>

<p>20. Seperatist&nbsp;shuttle- the blue and grey ship that&nbsp;iconicly carried&nbsp;Newt&nbsp;Gunray is here. 4</p>

<p>21.G8-R3- don&#39;t recognise the name? This Astromech went up with R2 to fix the shields on the Naboo ship but didn&#39;t make it. Here he makes his debut in the Lego world. 5</p>

<p>22. Geonosis&nbsp;Nantex-class&nbsp;Starfighter- this set&nbsp;goes along with the&nbsp;other&nbsp;Geonosis ship and warrior. There is a really nice use of brown pieces and a lever. There is also an orange engine. 4</p>

<p>23. Pilot droid- this is the&nbsp;one droid I wished had come&nbsp;with&nbsp;7752 Count&nbsp;Dooku&#39;s Solar&nbsp;Sailer&nbsp;(see my review). This droid is only available in the Battle of Geonosis&nbsp;set. Another Geonosis build, Lego&#39;s on a roll! 5</p>

<p>24. Endor trooper- this&nbsp;guy has normal camo&nbsp;hat and torso. This guy is essential to any Endor assault scene. 4</p>

<p>I hope this review has persuaded you to remove this set from your attic or loft and build it for next year&#39;s display! Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</p>
