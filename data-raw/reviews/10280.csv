"Tar_Domo","2014-09-24T15:09:41.76Z","HH-87 Starhopper Full review","<p>I bought this set last year from 20% sale. It&acute;s a Clone Wars set and you can still get it from Lego Shop. I think it will retire in the end of this year.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was smaller than tme same-priced Pre Vizslas Mandalorian Fighter. The instructions were easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set contains mostly light-brown and grey pieces. It has also some green parts. I think both the green and the brown parts are rare &acute;cause you really can&acute;t find them from every second set.</p>

<p>In the set you get also good parts for building an AAT. That may interest you if you&acute;re building a separatist / trade federation army. Well the new AAT is coming next year so you may want to wait till that day to choose witch one is better idea but then this may be only avaible in Amazon and Ebay. You can of course also buy just a little bit smaller Microfighter version instead of using this set.</p>

<p>This set has not a lot of exclusive part except those that I mentioned.</p>

<h3><span data-scayt-word=""Minifigures"">Minifigures</span></h3>

<p>This set contains three minifigures that are all exclusive.</p>

<p>Cad Bane - You can get Cad Bane also from other sets but not this Cad Bane. This version has a new head and torso. The hat is the same, though.</p>

<p>Nikto Guard - This may be a must have minifigure for CW collectors. He has a long axe and many details on his headpiece and torso.</p>

<p>Obi-Wan Kenobi as Rako Hardeen - He looks a bit weird but is cool and exclusive and a CW collector&acute;s must-have.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this was quite easy. It stats from the cockpit and continues on the wings. It came in three bags. Building the wings feels of course a bit repetitive. It has some stickers also.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The ship is great for display and the minifigures for play. &nbsp;There&acute;s a small speeder also. This is good for both - collectors and children.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I recommend this for SW collectors and mostly for CW collectors.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>&gt; three exclusive minifigures</p>

<p>&gt; cool CW ship</p>

<p>&gt; exclusive colored pieces</p>

<p>&gt; pieces for an AAT MOC</p>

<p>&gt; Strong enough for play</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>&gt; a little bit too pricey if not on sale</p>

The set has the starhopper which is the main feature of the set and it also includes the 3 figures and a speeder. The speeder is small and has a relatively blocky, sloped-looking build. The front is clever and works well to demonstrate the shape of the speeder and is adjustable with simple bar hinges.</p>

<p>The Starhopper has a very unique design in both in universe and indeed in the way that this model is designed. The interior is very primitive and has control panel&nbsp;with some lights around the sides&nbsp;surrounding it as well as some suggestion for a seat. However, there is nothing more than this inside. These could be used to represent the weapons on the ship which are in the form of the 2 flick-fire missiles which have a simple firing system to launch remotely.</p>

<p>Moreover the larger wings on the side can rotate between flight-mode and landing-mode. They only use ratcheted hinged hence can be easily put in place. However, the main feature which lifts the speeder into the rear hold of the ship which can be launched from beneath by a tiled button on top, which is an incredibly well-integrated system.</p>

<p>The 3 figures however are the stand-out part of the set. The Nikto guard has very simple yet effective armour detail and a simple vibro-axe which works well. The cad bane is also in a simple&nbsp;pattern which works for the figure as this was set when Cad Bane, Rako Hardeen and Morallo Eval (who isn&#39;t included in the set). The highlight figure for me however is the Rako Hardeen which is decorated immaculately to how he looked in the story arc.</p>
