These are not easy to flick and should just be used for the look. There are two escape pods. Also there are four landing gears.

However, if you forget about the price, 9500 is much more detailed and has Darth Malgus which is the best of all the SWTOR minifigs already released (in my opinion).

"aredotam","2013-12-19T00:45:38.273Z","Fabulous Set for Collectors and General Star Wars Fans","<p>The Jedi Defender-class Cruiser was originally created for the online video game Star Wars The Old Republic as the principle vehicle for the Jedi Knight/Consular character. Lego has done a great job of taking the design and making it into a set that all can enjoy even if they are unfamiliar with the video game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Minifigures: The minifigs in this set are fantastic, and three are exclusive only to the Defender. As with the Defender itself, Lego did a great job replicating the characters from the game. Oddly enough they are given generic labels even though two of them are certainly specific people from the Old Republic game. The Jedi Knight (Kao Cen Darach) is a Zabrak and comes with a special piece for his head to create a circle of horns. His green and brown armor is entirely unique.The Jedi Consular does appear to be a generic minifig but Lego didn&#39;t make her uninteresting. The Consular&#39;s tattooed green head marks her as a Mirialan, and her white head piece and armor are great replicas of the fancier consular gear in the video game. The Consular also carries a green double-bladed lightsaber which is pretty neat. The Sith Warrior (Darth Marr) has very detailed gray, red, and silver armor and a red hood. His head is gray and the face is printed to look like a mask to match the body armor. He also comes with two black handled lightsabers. The last minifig is a Sith Trooper, which is a human with black body armor, helmet, and blaster. The Sith Trooper also comes in two other Star Wars Old Republic Lego sets.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Overall Design: The Defender is both good looking and sturdy (with a few exceptions). The chassis mostly consists of technic pieces, which makes the build more interesting and a bit more difficult (but not extremely hard). The exterior design is really nice, and even though the ship is primarily red and gray it&#39;s still appealing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Landing Gear: The four landing gear pieces do fold up, although not entirely into the ship, and solidly support the Defender when resting.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Carrying Handle: A folding handle sits just behind the cockpit on the top of the Defender, making it very easy to carry the entire ship. The handle is integrated into the chassis and is super tough. I&rsquo;ve never had the feeling that the handle would break lose while even supporting the ship&rsquo;s entire weight for an extended time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Escape Pods: The two detachable escape pods on either side easily hold a minifig and a blaster or lightsaber. A small computer and large seat give the inside good detail.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cockpit: The cockpit is very accessible through two opening panels on the top of the ship. Each side of the cockpit can comfortably fit a minifig and their weapon(s).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Holocron Storage: There are two places that hold Jedi Holocrons on the Defender. One is in the back of the ship between the two engines. The other is in a curious place and easily overlooked as it sits on top of the Defender between the opening cockpit panels.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Escape Pods: While these are cool and functional, the top of the pods doesn&rsquo;t connect to anything and only slide on. Because of this if the ship is turned over the top of the pods will fall off.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Blaster Cannons: The Defender has a pair of rotating cannons on either side of the cockpit. While they look nice they have the tendency to break off with very little pressure applied.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Satellite Dish: A very Millennium Falcon like dish sits on top of the Defender. It&rsquo;s nice looking but also has a habit of coming off easily.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Engines: These are nicely done for the most part, but the little flaps around the engines can come off with very little effort. Otherwise I really liked the engine design.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cheap Interior: The cockpit is very accessible and roomy, but very sparse as it only comes with one computer screen per seat. I added a ton lights and other controls to both sections of the cockpit and, with a slight adjustment to the seats, it still has plenty of room for the two passengers.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall the Jedi Defender-class Cruiser is fantastic. At $90 it&rsquo;s fairly expensive but all Star Wars sets are higher on average, especially those nearing 1000 pieces. The Defender looks great as a display piece and it&rsquo;s interesting and tough enough to play with as well.</p>
