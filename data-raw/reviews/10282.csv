"Minifig_Man","2013-08-02T10:18:44.973Z","Great accessory pack","<p>A good idea to release an accessory pack for the Duplo trains. I could've done without the 3 blocks and used an extra rail piece.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good diversity of parts</li><li>Lot's of rails</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Only one crossing barrier? What about the Duplo people coming from the other side?</li><li>Would've been nice to have a bridge, a signal light or some special parts.</li></ul>
<p>Overall a nice set.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
