<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Super simple instructions, but some stepwise instructions are included, the box is big and attractive to pick off the shelf in the toystore.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice quality, many printed parts, no stickers on Duplo, which toddlers offcourse&nbsp;cannot manage, I love the classic look of the steam locomotive and the sound of adding water into the kettle,&nbsp;the wistle and of the steamcilinders, very nice, something which should be included in todays Lego train line-up.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two, a machinist for the locomotive and a young female passenger with suitcase, nice sturdy quality</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy and fast with help from dad!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Allot of fun to play with, looks and feels very sturdy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Spot-on for us, 5 stars!</p>

This set is packed with fun features. These include a fully functional and good-looking&nbsp;train with sound (kids love this). Just insert 3 AA batteries into the train and press the button on the top of the first cart and the train will move forward while making train sounds.</p>

<p>There is also a gas pump that you can plug into the train and sounds will come out from the train!&nbsp;There is also&nbsp;enough rail for a circle (even if the train operates outside of the rail, kids still love to have the train going forward and hitting the wall).&nbsp;2 mini-figures and an animal are included (always good to have these as these are always a hit&nbsp;with kids, not just adults) as well, which is quite a reasonable amount for the price. Finally, the bricks included here are above-average for a Duplo set as it creates a good-looking house-like structure (with window, roof and a&nbsp;clock) that the train can pass through. All in all, for USD 45, there is a lot of great features here. We have bought her nephew&nbsp;other Duplo sets before, but this is by far her nephew&#39;s&nbsp;favorite now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also own the Lego cargo train myself (60052) that I paid around USD 150 for (and I&#39;m pretty happy with that set). If I compare the 2 though, I&nbsp;feel that if one can get 3 of this type of&nbsp;Duplo set (a short train with railways, with decent amount of&nbsp;minifigures and bricks at a 45 dollar price point)&nbsp;and have the rail connected (maybe add some switching tracks so the 3 trains can run simultaneously), the Duplo train could be even&nbsp;more impressive as a stand-alone unit than the 60052.&nbsp;</p>
