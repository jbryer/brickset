<p abp=""572"">The box is a very useful and large box that can be used to store additional legos</p>

<p abp=""573"">the instructions are for one model only , and the second models does not have instructions on the lego website ( you have to use the picture on the card board that comes on top of the&nbsp;box)</p>

<h3 abp=""574"">Parts</h3>

<p abp=""575"">lots of nice colors, it has parts that can be used for different purposes in one box</p>

<h3 abp=""576"">Minifigures</h3>

<p abp=""577"">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 abp=""579"">The build</h3>

<p abp=""580"">Got this set from Toys R Us for and my 6 , and 8 year old boy and girl love it.</p>

<p abp=""581"">They spend a lot of time building and rebuilding ,lots of playability especially with the small tiny fish and crab .One down side that&nbsp;the crane single hinge does not support the loads (tends to lean down)</p>

<p abp=""582"">&nbsp;</p>

<p abp=""584"">&nbsp;</p>

<h3 abp=""586"">The completed model</h3>

<p abp=""587"">looks nice and simple , but you can always add lots of other builds with the spare additional parts that remain after the completed model,they built houses,ice cream cones ,etc... and that is the magic of Lego .</p>

<h3 abp=""588"">Overall opinion</h3>

<p abp=""589"">My kids added this set to the existing city sets they have and it just completed the city theme ,now they have their own small little harbor,fishing and freight boat ,and this set&nbsp; was categorized under the theme : creative , because 609 pieces&nbsp;need your small kids imaginations create and&nbsp;build and build .</p>

"yerdna","2017-08-11T09:38:48.94Z","Excellent starter set","<p>This is one of the best Bricks And More sets and an excellent starter set especially if you (or your kids ;-) ) enjoy ships and harbors. There is a great variety of tiles, two minifigs and a bunch of animals. The crane is a masterpiece, almost as good as the harbor cranes in the CITY series. The ship and the truck&nbsp;are more basic but still very nice. There are many special tiles which is not usual for Bricks And More sets. If you have other sets from the Bricks&nbsp;And More Series, this will be an wonderful add-on but you can play with the set alone as well.</p>
