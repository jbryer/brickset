<br />
She has a fairly large collection of Duplo, and these days we use the duplo tub when we go out, or camping, as its harder to lose pieces</p>

<p>She loves building things with this set, and she loves when daddy helps her make even more fantastical creations</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is nice, and has a number of buildable inspirations on the sides. One side features a number of animals/houses and ALL the models can be built at one time, the other side has a dinosaur/jurassic type scene with volcanoes, dinosaurs and baby dinosaurs, again all on that side can be built, but not at the same time as the other side.<br />
<br />
The box is very useful for storage, and although I would&#39;ve preferred a tub, with the lid it is fairly sturdy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of fantastic&nbsp;parts in great colours. We love the round eye tiles. Its really a combination between traditional BASIC parts tubs and a creator tub. Even teaches SNOT techniques!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None. But there are lots of googly&nbsp;type eyes and bricks with faces</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>No instructions, so no &quot;build&quot; but you can build all the models, which provides good inspiration and then the parts can be used for building towns, houses, or animals etc. It can be tricky working out exactly how the models were built, but that&#39;s part of the fun.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Fantastic way to bootstrap a lego&nbsp;collection for creative purposes</p>

My wife and I managed to pick up 6 before the rest of the hordes got the rest (only 30 were available at the store I was at).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is fairly tall and the top is good for sorting the pieces (as shown as an example on the box itself). These are easily stackable and once you remove all the packaging from the inside you can easily fit 2 towers worth of bricks into a single tower.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a huge variety of parts. A little disappointed that there were no wheels but the light blue color is too cool.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You can build just about anything. I do wish it came with a base plate though.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very good for the price I found it for.</p>

"tommycarstensen","2018-07-01T15:54:15.287Z","Almost as good as set 6177","<p>This set contained slopes, modified plates, round bricks and a few other parts that are not as useful as regular bricks. It presented almost as good value as set 6177. This set contained a few more colours than set 6177, but each set of colours&nbsp;were smaller than 6177 and there was an overweight of red in this set. This set seems to have a higher rating than 6177, but in my opinion it should definitely be the other way around.</p>
