<p>For any architecture building fan, this is honestly a must-have. The parts by themselves are worth the money, and the fact that you can put them together and make this creation is a mere bonus!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Elegant, streamlined, easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of white and blue.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Some of the smaller landmark sets is a bit too easy to build. One feels a bit cheated after a few minutes. The UN is small, but interesting and fun to build - and it last longer than you would think, looking at the size of the box and finished building.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Such a beautiful and interesting model!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The UN is one of my favorite sets of the smaller architecture/landmark sets. It is fun and interesting to build, and it looks fantastic. It made me want to visit the building. Such a beautiful and interesting set - and such a beautiful and interesting &quot;real&quot; building.</p>

<p>The box is very nice. &nbsp;I actually wish they did more sets like this, &nbsp;I&#39;ve actually modified Technics models to have this type of &quot;opening&quot; box, to better keep original model pieces all contained. &nbsp;Bought the model at a Lego store and the front and bottom were showing some wear from being on the shelf.</p>

<p>Parts &nbsp;<strong>EXCELLENT. &nbsp;</strong>Right from the start you are getting &nbsp;155 light blue translucent 1 x 2&#39;s ( 13 1 x 2 tiles) &nbsp;. &nbsp;Additionally, you are going to be receiving &quot;SNOT&quot; building pieces such as 15 &quot;ledge&quot; 1 x 1-1 front knob white bricks.&nbsp;There are 22 dark bluish gray &quot;flush&quot; 1 x 1-1 front knob&nbsp;bricks! &nbsp; &nbsp;There are lots of white tiles with about 14 dark green 1 x 3 and 1 x 4 tiles. &nbsp;43 tiles alone are white (5 2 x 2, 19 1 x 4, 111x2x8, 6 1 x 8). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp; None included as is the norm for the Architecture series. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, the only set with a mini-figure&nbsp;is the &quot;unofficial&quot; Lego House, currently under construction in Billund, Denmark, which is a neat model, however Lego seems to be trying to keep it unlinked &quot;officially&quot; with a strange 4000010 model number designation and I&#39;ve not had luck finding the usual .pdf instructions online. &nbsp;These were created for the retailers surrounding the construction project to be appeased during construction of the building as a show of goodwill by Lego.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a good youtube&nbsp;video showing its construction. &nbsp;(Reason I went in to that is because very interestingly, this model number, 4000010 is the ONLY Architectural model which DOES&nbsp;include a mini-figure). &nbsp;If you are a Lego collector/enthusiast and have a good selection of white bricks you can likely construct this model. &nbsp;Now back to the United Nations!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was really surprising! &nbsp;I immediately was attracted to this model because of all the shiny windows in the sleek looking tower. &nbsp;I was really exited about the tower. &nbsp;Before you get to the tower, which is the last part of the build, you create the base, then begin on the construction of the base buildings. &nbsp;This actually takes a pretty good amount of time, which is rather enjoyable because of the attention to small detail, and how carefully the architectural rendering in tiny Lego scale begin to amaze you. &nbsp;Constructing the U.N. &quot;Hall&quot; on the left is incredibly detailed and brilliant! &nbsp;The ground level supporting buildings/offices/hallways are also really cool, utilizing the &quot;mini&quot; build of Legos.</p>

<p>When the ground area is nearing an end, it was almost kind of sad because constructing it was really fun.</p>

<p>The last part of the build is the tower, which also utilizes a very clever build style. &nbsp;It can get monotonous for sure, but does not take too incredibly long. &nbsp;The final top off to the tower is again, very ingenious and clever.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Beautiful. &nbsp;Very detailed and cool. &nbsp;Getting the flags up in the end and getting them uniform is a bit of a challenge.</span></p>

<h3>The completed model&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Gorgeous. &nbsp;Beautiful. &nbsp;Level of detail is incredible. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Great display piece, excellent addition to the Architecture line.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Really impressed with this model. &nbsp;Will more than likely pick up another one or two to add to my parts inventory and keep as an investment.</p>

<p>Just a last word on some &quot;drawbacks&quot; which can be lived with, but can&#39;t hurt to share observance. &nbsp;The front sign on the black tile, saying United Nations Headquarters&quot; are actually two tiles. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the placing of the words on the left tile, at least in this set, sit lower than the &quot;Headquarters&quot; tile on the right which sits higher. &nbsp;The end result is the text line &nbsp;looks sloppy. &nbsp;Really kind of a lazy &quot;mistake&quot;, which should not happen.</p>

<p>Other suggestion would just be about the booklet/instructions. &nbsp;It&#39;s rather nice and contains much historical discussion, architectural philosophies and history about the creation of this landmark. &nbsp;Using the instructions from the book looked to be a big pain and would show unnecessary wear and tear, for those reasons, try to just use the online Lego .pdf instructions instead!!</p>
