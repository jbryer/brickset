"Zatth","2013-12-10T11:58:24.73Z","Surge Flies Into Action!","<p>I do not actually own this set, but purchased it for my brother as a birthday gift. So I'm lucky enough to have the opportunity to review this fine set!</p><p>Brain Attack Surge was released in the second half of 2013, as part of the second Brain Attack wave. His original price was USD 12.99, and 9.99 Euro. (I'm not European, so I hope that was grammatically correct!)</p><p>This meant that he was released at the same time and price point as <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=44010-1"">44010 STORMER</a>. So for the people who want to choose just one, there's a bit of competition going on here. SURGE, or STORMER?</p><p>Read on to get an idea of how SURGE stacks up!</p><p><br></p><p></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Color Scheme: The colors in this set are well-chosen. The gunmetal and blue primary scheme contrasts nicely and fits with Surge's typical vibe, while the trans-lime green accenting adds excitement without looking out of place.<br></li><li>Piece Selection: Surge provides some great resources for MOC'ers. The trans-lime green and trans-blue armor pieces are rare, and Surge comes with two of each. The marbled trans-blue-and-lime-green ""lightning"" pieces are a first, and are sure to be highly popular. There are also plenty of basic armor pieces and ""bones"".<br></li><li>Playability and Poseability: Surge is excellent for action photos! The set almost asks to be swooshed through the air, and fulfills this role amazingly - the aesthetic of the set as a whole is very sleek. <br></li><li>The Hero Core: As is common these days, the Hero Core piece comes with quite a few - six hundred - points for the Hero factory Brain Attack Game. If you enjoy the game, this is quite a bonus.<br></li></ul><h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>A few poseability issues are present with his lightning shooter. The shooter assembly, unfortunately, conflicts a bit with the armor piece on his forearm. Surge's hand has to be angles so as to not add stress to either the armor or the shooter assembly. This isn't overly bad, however.<br></li><li>Visor piece: This may come as a disappointment to some, but the visor piece does not entirely fit over Surge's face. It sort of hangs over the face, but there are gaps. One would think that the visor would clamp more securely, to protect their face. Like the previous con, though, this one isn't too bad.</li></ul><p>Overall, SURGE is a well-designed set with a number of exciting and fun highlights and features, whether you're buying for a Hero Factory fan or an MOC builder. If you're interested, go for it!<br></p>

"anofficialstripeline","2014-08-22T01:07:02.72Z","Looks a bit better than expected.","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As for all the same Brain Attack and Breakout sets, they all have a reusable packaging that is totally worth it! The instruction has a total of 25 pages&nbsp;of building!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The helmet is brand new, the visor, the lightning parts, and most are existing from the previous sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigures! :(</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build isn&#39;t that bad, took about 20-25 minutes to finish building!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks great, but worse than Furno XL.&nbsp;This set&nbsp;has good play features. The jetpack looks amazing with the flick fire play&nbsp;feature, the weapon can spin,&nbsp;and the visor. Translucent parts were a great touch, the drone was also add in, and his weapon looks alright. The helmet looks okay, although the whole eyes of Surge doesn&#39;t get covered&nbsp;which sucks, and the back doesn&#39;t look too boring compared to others except for Stormer and Furno that they also have it. Overall its alright.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Set looks very good, but still lacks a few problems though. $13 is pretty worth the price getting the item, but recommended to get Stormer and Furno if you like them better. This set is the second best in my opinion which there are contents I love to see. I would have give this a perfect score if this was flawless, but too bad, it has a few flaws.</p>
