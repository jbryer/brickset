But when I saw the cgi model of this guy I knew I had to get back into Hero Factory.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Really fun to flap the wings.</li><li>The mouth is well articulated.<span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>&nbsp;Legs aren't completly covered with armor.</li><li>Tail dosen't have enough articulation.</li></ul>
<p>Overall this is a good set first try at a dragon, hopefully they will do another in a future(I like the sound of Dragonbolt 2.0). Well now the question is left, should you buy it, Well I saw yes.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
"Faefrost","2013-11-10T20:16:42.47Z","Great Dragon","<p>If you are looking for a Lego Dragon, and don't want to spring for a vastly expensive Ninjago one, Dragon Bolt is a great alternative. Great size and feel. Decent coloring. An oddly addictive wing flap mechanism. Good stuff.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It's a nice big Dragon</li><li>It's highly Swooshable... flapflapflapflap!</li><li>The Brain Slug is that nice multi tone and really gives it some pop</li><li>Did I mention it's a nice BIG lego Dragon?</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It's a little bare in spots and could use a bit more armoring here and there. Especially right at the breat bone area. Just snapping on another black chest piece really improves it.&nbsp;</li><li>The Wings, while fun with the flapping are otherwise unposable and a little weird looking. &nbsp;</li><li>The head is great, but the lower jaw needs something more. It looks a little too technic ish.&nbsp;</li><li>The mech/robot details make it more difficult to reuse in places like Castle and LotR.</li></ul>
<p>A great Hero Factory foe, and also a decent crossover set for those seeking a nice playable articulated Dragon for other system scale themes. It has more weight and presence than other Lego Dragons such as most Ninjago and all Castle ones.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5

<p>Comes in an enormous bag. Instructions go to Page 40.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>149 pieces overall. Head piece looks great but kinda useless for MOCs. 4 black claws, cool parts. 8 lightning parts. 6 of the sword pieces used as wings. 4 transparent greenish yellow 3 sized armor parts. Blue savage planet claw pieces. Multi colored brain bug, that glows in the dark.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Went together more like a technic set. Very interesting build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks brilliant When completed. Very nice looking dragon. Has moving jaws and flapping wings action.&nbsp;</p>
