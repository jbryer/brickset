Seems like it is the Adam and Eve of Lego if you will. I have know idea how I ever received this set, since I didn't really get into Lego until about 1984. I assume it was from a small store with some old inventory.<br></p><p>As far as the parts go, the mother and father figures are quite unique, and the baseplate is also completely different than anything I've ever seen. <br></p><p>All in all though, this is a timepiece and I'm glad I still have it with original box and all the paperwork to go with it. </p><br>",TRUE,2,3,2,2,2
