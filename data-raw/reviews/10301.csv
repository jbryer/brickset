No gimmicks, just some cool skulpting and details, and some color choices that really draw the eye and just pop. A great HF villain. The ultimate abominable snow monster or frost giant. Whatever you want.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The colors just reach out and grab your eyes. The white and trans medium blue are great. The small red accents just push it over the top.</li><li>Great face</li><li>The additional chest and shoulder details make the fig seem much more complete and alive than most Constraction figs</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>It suffers from the typical Hero Factor / Constraction fig open skeletal back</li><li>The giant left claw hand looks great from the front, but is just a hollow shell from behind.</li><li>The sword blade isn't the trans medium blue that it appears to be on the bag. Instead it is a softer translucent teal color. Not bad. Just not what was expected.</li></ul>
<p>Overall if you are a fan of Constraction figs, this one is probably a must have.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
