<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging overall for this guy isn&#39;t too bad, very reusable to put in your HF toys in there! The instruction manual has a total 24 pages of building!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The helmet is new for the set, the visor, as well as a code with different letters and numbers. Most lego parts&nbsp;have been re-used for other sets besides&nbsp;Hero Factory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Sadly no minifigures :(</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took about 15-20 minutes to finish. It&#39;s not like they each have more than 1,00 pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t really mind about the parts too much, what really makes the set bad is the down grade. The shoulder armor was re-used for the Breakout evo, the legs are kind of a bit down graded in my opinion, but the parts are very movable. Evo&#39;s new helmet and visor was phenomenal, the weapon looks good, but does not make any sense why there is a piece in one of his hand. The only play feature you get in this set is to just spin the staff and open the visor, not too interesting in my opinion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Kind of&nbsp;my least favorite character for the brain attack wave, but better than 2.0 at least. It has more pieces which is not bad, character itself looks alright, but just some parts really makes me disappointed. I still like the Breakout Evo better, but this is still recommended if you&#39;re a Hero Factory fan of Evo. Price is not bad as well.</p>

"Studded_Dud","2020-08-02T20:38:26.85Z","Hero Factory Guy","<p>Building Experience: The building experience is pretty easy, and also a bit repetitive. It goes by pretty quick so that is nice. The guy it&#39;s self looks great for the Hero Factory line, but out of that and Bionicle&nbsp;he just doesn&#39;t fit.</p>

<p>Parts: There are some good parts in this 51-piece set. Bionicle pieces usually are hard to use in anything other than Bionicle so it is nice that not all of these are Bionicle. There are some nice tooth pieces and some good technic pieces. About all the others are Bionicle.</p>

<p>Playability: Playability with Hero Factory and Bionicle are never ending. There are so many things that can happen with an imagination and a Hero Factory</p>

<p>Value for Money: It cost&nbsp;&pound;7.99 / $9.99 and had 51 pieces. Judging that the pieces are genuinely all big it makes sense that it would cost this price. It also has a number on the back of the hero symbol for a game.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall if you don&#39;t like Bionicle or Hero Factory then this is not the set for you and it is just another Hero Factory Guy. If you do like those than this is a perfect set for you.</p>
