<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>one pro would include the face (which looks reminiscent of that truck&#39;s face&nbsp;from the movie,&nbsp;Maximum Overdrive, seriously it does)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>another pro&nbsp;is that the swords are a good addition (plus they can come together)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>the piraka feet also do help give a slightly aquatic feel to him ad i absolutely like that</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>now for a few small&nbsp;cons, the&nbsp;limbs are too small and&nbsp;titanium mettallic&nbsp;does not&nbsp;blend well. i honestly suggest switching it to black in order to get a more apppealling color scheme</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>overall a decent set, but could&#39;ve been slightly more armoured</p>
