It is quite unusual for a Lego game to be nice (for me) as a Lego building set on it own merit which warrants me writing this short review.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The set looks nice when finished, worth displaying next to bigger Chima sets.<br></li><li>The build contains nice 'Studs-Not-On-Top' features for Mount Cavora<br></li><li>A lot of nice mini-forest details around the base</li><li>The game is quite decent to play and can easily be modified to be more strategic (less random) or even more random if you so choose.<br></li><li>The micro Chima characters are cute</li><li>My 8-year old kids enjoy playing the game.</li><li>Only source of Chima micro-figures (12 of them!)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Mount Cavora is not mounted very sturdily so it falls over quite easily.<br></li><li>The game is more strategic when not using the die, although younger kids probably like the random nature of the special tiles on the die.<br></li><li>The game is very quick. Sometimes it feels nice to be able to drag it out a bit more.</li><li>The game had the potential of being more strategic such as the game Carcasonne but fall short due to the compulsory inclusion of the die.<br></li></ul>
<p>If you like the Chima range, like I do, I would say this set is a must have, since it captures the essence and atmosphere of the theme so nicely. The reason I only give it a 4/5 rating though is because the whole set is very small scale and there are nicer builds and&nbsp; mini-figures to be had at this price range. This is one of the nicer Lego Games that I've laid my hands on, and I do have quite an extensive collection.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
