<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This comes in a cardboard box containing all the microfigures and parts.<br />
The instruction manual is medium sized and contains 31 pages of building instructions.<br />
Also included is a rule-book and a poster which has his regular poster-side and also a side showing the 3 ways this game can be played.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Many many tile and tile with knob pieces!<br />
Also some pieces making up the walls and storm ladders and the small castle.<br />
Also included are 32&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4529234"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Nose Cone Small 1X1</a>&nbsp;pieces.<br />
Besides the regular pieces a lego&nbsp;dice with two times three side-pieces (ring/skull/sword), a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6037558"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">String</a>&nbsp;piece with on each side a knob and a&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4599453"" style=""text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Mini Figure Crowbar</a>.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>28 Microfigures (for those not acquainted, microfigures are 1 by 1 small versions of minifigures and are in 1 piece).&nbsp;<br />
Good guys: King&nbsp;Th&eacute;oden, Aragorn, Gimly, &Eacute;owyn, Haldir, Legolas and 4 Rohirrim Swordsmen<br />
Bad guys: Uruk-Hai general, Uruk-Hai Archer, 5 Uruk-Hai berserkers and 11 Uruk-Hai swordsmen.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very enjoyable as there is not that much repetitive work (aside from the connecting minifigure platforms).<br />
Storm ladders are pretty cool as is the small castle.<br />
<br />
Be warned however to build this on a sturdy platform (I would recommend in the box as it makes playing and moving the game very easy) as it easily comes apart.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The game</h3>

<p>The game can be played in 3 different ways, and every further way has you adding to the fort (meaning that the shortest way only uses a small part of the build).<br />
<br />
Be sure to check the game rules as the first few times I had played it, we actually ended up playing it a whole different way making &#39;the good side&#39; almost unbeatable.</p>

<p>Also if you are bored playing it, the rule book suggests some variations to spice it up again.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very fun and really gives you the feeling that an Uruk-Hai army is storming Helms Deep.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like the game very much, it gives you a multitude of playing ways and is enjoyable for many ages.</p>
