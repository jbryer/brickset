I just got this fine little set at a garage sale, where I was unexpectedly charmed by it.  In addition to a full set of small Duplo people (they allow for a pretty wide range of interaction, is what I mean by ""full set"") -- the mom, the kid, and the Doctor -- the set offers an ambulance, a chair and table, a stretcher that doubles as an exam table inside the doctor's office, and a wonderful small part -- a red telephone with touchpad and receiver.

It's a good set for children of either gender -- boys can race the ambulance as well as play with the figures inside the hospital, while girls can have fun setting up the interior and arranging things to meet their own play objectives.

City sets like these also allow for unstructured play that doesn't depend on television shows to provide the plot -- kids can play around the idea that if you're reckless, you could get hurt and go to the hospital, or around the idea of going to the sometimes scary doctor's office.  They can play the scolding or the comforting mother, the competent or the threatening doctor, and the strong or weak or naughty or brave kid.

And as a grownup, I'm really happy to have one of the precursors to the classic minifig utensil -- the always-handy black telephone!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
