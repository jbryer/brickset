<p>This Polybag is ridiculously hard to come by in Canada, it is only available packaged in what is called the Heartlake City Collection at Costco. This is a set with three books, two learning to read DK readers (Welcome to Heartlake City and Friends Forever) as well as a condensed version of The Ultimate Sticker Book LEGO Friends (with only 125 reusable stickers instead of the 1000 the larger version includes.)</p>
<p>Is it worth picking up? Well...</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The set is fast to build, fun looking and includes a lot of great pink pieces. 
<li>Introduces a new Ice Cream Cone accessory piece. 
<li>Includes Emma the Mini-Doll 
<li>Features a nice design for the cart. 
<li>The books in Heartlake City Collection are all very nice add-ins for young fans, even as an AFOL I found myself enjoying the simple nature of the books, reading them showed just how well LEGO has handeled this Theme.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The popsicle piece would be better off in red honestly, it would make it more unique, plus we haven't seen it in that color yet. Yellow is not the best color for it. 
<li>Rarity of finding it, packaging it the way they did was a great way of getting it out there, but the price for it is 7.49$ Value is in the eye of the buyer here, I was willing to pay that price. Others may not. 
<li>Only one Ice Cream Cone piece, it would have been nice to see two or three of them in this Polybag.</li></ul>
<p>To sum up my thoughts on this Polybag, it's another great addition from LEGO for their Friends line. It has a great looking little model with a fun design, has loads of play value. The fact that you get three books with it for younger readers and such, it's not a bad deal honestly in my opinion. The only thing I'd really like to have seen honestly was a few more ice cream cone pieces and maybe a better colored popsicle piece.</p>
<p>Recommended, though if you'd prefer to own just the model try and find this Polybag for a good price online, as I highly doubt Canadians will be seeing it on its own any time soon.</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,3,3

<p>Pros:<br />
Instructions contain a LEGOLAND coupon for kids. Nice, rare pieces. Fun to play with.</p>

<p>Cons:<br />
Fold-up instructions are uncomfortable to use. Small value for money. Shirt ink rubs off.</p>
