The lion is nice if you are not willing to spend much $ collecting Chima sets, and just wanted to see what its all about, the headpiece pretty much sums up all the characters in the Chima theme, as I believe all have a double head along with a headpiece. The small car looks like a lion and gives some nice parts, and the set includes a small interesting blue crystal too.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice figure (Lion)</li><li>Car works well</li><li>Lots of playability</li><li>Crystal</li><li>Good parts</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I wish it would've taken longer to make &nbsp; &nbsp;:)</li></ul>
<p>For a great price and nice pieces, next time you see this polybag floating around, pick it up quick!</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

Let's go over the pros and cons of this polybag.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leonidas is offered cheaply, he's in quite a few sets so he's not that hard to come by. Still it's nice to have an option where you can get a Lion Tribe member without needing to buy a larger set. 
<li>Chi crystal included. 
<li>The dragster looks like a fast little vehicle and is fun to play with.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leonidas has no armour, no weapons and no storage space on his vehicle for the Chi Crystal. Also he isn't exactly rare like Crug. 
<li>Not much to build, the Dragster isn't as solid looking as Ewar's Acro Fighter or Crug's Swamp Boat... On the other hand it does still evoke the look of a lion's face&nbsp;even if it is quite small.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, as polybags go it isn't bad. Not sure if I'd recommend this to hard core collectors of Chima because chances are they already own enough Leonidas and vehicles for the Lion Tribe. Still if all you're into are Polybags this isn't a bad set, it's not the best from the Legends of Chima Theme; however it's not bad and definitely one you're going to get if you're a completist of Polybags every year like I've slowly become.</p>
<p>That plus the sheer level of detail in the Chima Mini-Figures is just enough to sell a lot of questionable designs to me when we start looking at polybags and smaller sets. Because... well how can you not want to have as many of these lovingly crafted Mini-Figs in your collection as possible? Still, kind of wish they'd at least given these polybag Mini-Figs some kind of weapons to fight with.</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,2,3
