Thankfully this isn't one of those types.</p>
<p>Birthday Party is one of three brand new Friends Polybags being offered by LEGO this year, out of the three available I find this one to be a bit less useful for parts and the overall design of the model.</p>
<p>This Polybag has two things and only two things that are built from it, a table with a cake and balloons and a birthday present. Now the table itself is built using two circular plates and a cylinder, then you add some other parts to make the balloons (although I've never known a balloon to have gaping holes in them) and of course you get to build a jelly and icing filled cake. (Using white and clear red studs to simulate the effect.) As models go it isn't that bad, the build is simple and quick; like in most Polybag sets, and it does offer up some nice colors. (Pale blue and yellow for the plates, dark rose balloon string holding parts and the balloons themselves are yellow and green Astromech head pieces connected via a Technic piece.)</p>
<p>All-in-all not a bad model, the cake is a nice touch and as a bonus there are two spare studs and a spare dark rose piece that can be used to make a nice icing topper on the cake. (With a dollop of jelly to go with it.) The present isn't much to look at, I mean if you've built one present from a LEGO Advent Calendar you've built them all and this design isn't any different from the numerous attempts at presents LEGO has given us before. The Mini-Doll of Andrea is identical to the one found in City Park Cafe, there are no differences in the print or costume at all. So overall, as I said before, this is pretty much a good Polybag. It features a nice little model to build, a fun looking Mini-Doll and some new pieces, does that mean you're going to rush out to buy it? I suppose it depends on how big a completist for the Friends Theme or Polybags in general you are. Although the solid yellow and green colored Astromech head pieces are some nice parts that you might want to get, so I'd say this is worth picking up, it just might not be the better one to get first out of the three on offer this year.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
