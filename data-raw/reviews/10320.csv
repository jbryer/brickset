"Odeinoichus","2013-10-30T21:56:08.443Z","Winter Picnic","<p><strong>Set #30108 Summer Picnic: </strong>This was a Summer Polybag for LEGO Friends in the States. As is typical for Canada we got it in the fall, whoops, still a pretty nifty looking Polybag to act as a decent display piece.</p>
<p>The basic build from this Polybag is a small picnic blanket with a tiny tree (more of a shrub or bush) nearby, a sandwhich, a juice/water bottle or something to that effect and that's about it. The pieces included are all fairly standard, not too many unique parts here, mind you the juice container is a nice clear orange cylinder with a few orange studs to enhance it. And there is a croissant piece in this set, in fact a lot of MOCers may buy up this multiple times just to get tons of Croissants.</p>
<p>The Mini-Doll is not unique, it's my one complaint from the LEGO Friends Polybags, while more often than not other Polybags from other Themes don't offer too many unique characters or prints, they do at least have a bit higher degree of good parts. Mia here is wearing the exact same outfit she's been in for at least five or six of the larger sets. LEGO is kind of missing the boat in not including either unique Mini-Dolls with new printing and different torsos/leg combinations, or at least giving you something that you don't see five times over in the other sets.</p>
<p>Overall, while I do still appreciate the Mini-Doll I would hope that LEGO improves their choices/selecting process for who get's included in their Friends Polybags, it's great to cheaply get the characters if you can't afford the sets, not so much for those who buy up all the smaller 12.99$ sets and then get these as a special gift. It's a pity when the accessories and main model make for a better buy than the characters included. Still recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
