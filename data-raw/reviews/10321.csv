Others could use a little work, when it comes to this small bonus from Costco I think this one works.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The model is sturdy and fun to play with, the propellors spin nicely and the overall look is great. 
<li>Useful red pieces for MOC enthusiasts. 
<li>In Canada is included as a bonus at Costco in the LEGO On the Move Collection, which ups the value for the price because the books in this collection are fairly impressive. Two of them are re-printed sections of the LEGO Idea Book from 2011.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Propellors are a bit flimsy and if spun too roughly can fall apart during play.</li></ul>
<p>Overall this is a good Polybag. The price per piece ratio is fairly good on this and the miniature model is fun to play with and display. With only one real con to speak of as long as you're careful you won't have any problems with the thing falling apart. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3

Also, being a helicopter, you can get a lot of play value out of this. The propellers&nbsp;can spin and because they are so close together, you can spin them both at once!</p>

<p>There only a few disappointing things about this set: The propellers&nbsp;are close enough together that they often collide and stop spinning.&nbsp;Also, if you tilt the helicopter on a steep angle, the propellers will stop spinning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I still really enjoyed the build, play value and parts which was all worth the price!</p>
