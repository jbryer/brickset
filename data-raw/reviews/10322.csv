"Almaras","2013-04-10T20:47:53.31Z","A High Flying Poly!","<p>I'll admit straight up that I bought the Little Eagle with a single purpose in mind: To replace the molded eagle in 79007, and I've got to say - I am very impressed with this little guy! The build was a short one, only taking about 10 minutes, and that was with me savouring every step and stopping to look at the great variety of pieces included. </p>
<p>The finished model is a nice one. The eagle is capable of spreading his wings to soar over bricks below, or he can stand mightily with his wings folded by his side. His wings are surprisingly strong and hold their pose without wobbling around, and his legs take his weight easily and allow him to stand solidly, with very little effort required to make him balance (something I often find annoying when trying to pose models). I'll add that I am yet to find the Fierce Flyer, as I am keen to compare the two eagles, but I feel content just having the Little Eagle for now - as it really is a superb polybag.</p>
<p>For TLotR fans wondering: I took the two 1x2 flat plates off his back (and added them to his wings, which doesn't look too shabby!) and had Gandalf sit there. Gandalf is a little big, but he doesn't look too big for the Little Eagle, so I will happily add him to 79007 when I get my hands on it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

Just bought one at a reasonable price off eBay, and am thrilled with it. I don't understand why it is not widely available because it is a very entertaining little bird. TLG should make more of these because they are perfect for a polybag build and bird enthusiasts will eat them up.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>Almaras posted a wonderful review of Little Eagle; I agree with everything stated there. In addition, I do own two of the larger Fierce Flyers and wanted to compare them with Little Eagle. The big and little eagles perch together on my shelf guarding our LEGO Depot (my son's former bedroom), and they look fantastic! And we all need someone to guard our valuables 24/7.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>I am becoming a huge fan of polybags. They are fantastic little builds that bring many smiles to your face...at a time you may have been grumpy BEFORE you popped open the bag. So do pick up both the of these eagles before they completely fly away. It is getting difficult to find Fierce Flyer in our area, so don't miss it before it is gone from the stores.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
