LEGO seems to enjoy offering up fairly basic and similar models from year to year, the result being numerous versions of small fire cars and helicopters, boats and motorcycles.</p>
<p>Case in point here is another Polybag with a simple little model titled Fire Car, it doesn't really offer up any unique parts, though it does use the new hubcap pieces introduced with the Cars Theme from Disney instead of the older LEGO hubcap pieces. And it is really very similar to many other Polybag cars seen in the past.</p>
<p>However, Polybag enthusiasts love buying up everything LEGO has on offer, and this model while being simple and kind of sameish to past offerings is still very addictive and fun to roll around. A neat little LEGO model that you can put on your desk at work or home and just pick it up to roll around once in a while.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is a Fireman we've seen many times before in larger Fire based City Sets, in fact the torso, legs and headgear matches the design of the Fireman found in the Fire Boat I reviewed a while back, the only different part is his head. The printing on the Mini-Figure is pretty impressive though and a far cry from what Firemen of the past offered up.</p>
<p>Overall though, this is really mostly for Polybag enthusiasts or those LEGO fans who enjoy picking up cheap sets for parts and Mini-Figures. Still you can easily pass on this if you've bought previous Polybags from this theme before called Fire Car.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3

I just put it together, and realized that it&#39;s the successor to <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7241-1/Fire-Car"">7241</a>, in fact, it&#39;s almost the same. The minifigure has a striking resemblance to the young man on the &#39;07 set, almost implying that it&#39;s the same person. Of course, the car looks about the same, with smaller tires, and less siren. But it&#39;s not fair to judge this set based on one of days past, so I won&#39;t. I just find it interesting that LEGO seems to make minifigures age very quickly. In just six years, the fireman&#39;s beard went gray.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The polybag and instructions are as expected. It&#39;s a polybag, and it has fold-out instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are pretty good. I like the chasi, wheels, fenders, front piece that holds on the lights. Others are pretty generic, but that&#39;s ok, they have to be. Not everything can be a cool part!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure is pretty good. Not much to say about it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build... Oh boy. I wasn&#39;t very satisfied with it. I know, it&#39;s just a polybag, but still. It&#39;s kinda fragile. The front portion likes to fall off, as well as the back portion. The fireman may as well be riding a raw chasis. A couple of small parts, maybe flat tiles, maybe simple 1x2s would have held it together. Maybe I&#39;m exaggerating just a bit, but it is quite fragile.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall, it looks wimpy to be used to help fight a fire. Or even check fire hydrants. It&#39;s probably better used as an ugly street car.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a good set for parts, if you&#39;re going for parts.</p>
