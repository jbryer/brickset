Given that this polybag is only 23 parts there isn't too much to talk about but there are several aspects that made Crug's Swamp Jet stand out.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>First, Crug himself. I was very impressed with the care and detail given to the minifig. Printed front and back on the torso and the legs are also printed, even claws on the toes! Great attention is also given to Crug's face with dual sided printing. I was surprised to see his jaw is printed in metallic silver on both the head and the croc-headpiece. He also has a bolt printed on each side of his jaw so it looks like he has a metal replacement screwed on making him look extra tough. I also like his Dark Brown coloring that differentiates him from other Crocs in the Chima series.<br></li><li>Three olive green pieces are most welcome, and despite the low part count, just about all of the bricks are useful ones.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Twenty-three pieces isn't very many even for a poly and the build is over almost as soon as you have begun.<br></li><li>Minifig doesn't come with any weapons or accessories other than the Chi crystal.<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, a nice little poly with good parts and a great minifigure. It also manages to make a nice jet-ski that evokes the head of a crocodile. Worth a look especially if you like the Chima characters.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5

<p>The primary model in this Polybag is simple, very simple, we've seen it's like before in piece count and basic design. Though never before in these impressive looking colors, the best aspect of it is how well it fits in with the Cragger's Command Ship when placed next to it on display. Overall a simple little model that isn't much to talk about.</p>
<p>Crug however is just all kinds of perfection, this is the cheapest method for acquiring this Mini-Figure and he does not dissapoint. Like all of the LoC Mini-Figures we have a lot of attention to detail, with the most printed surface of any other Mini-Figure in LEGO's history I believe, all of them feature double-sided torso prints with inspiring level of detail. Leg printing showing off the toes and enhancing the upper torso print by bringing it further down. (Showing off the lower portion of the costume and further detail work basically.)</p>
<p>Not to mention the double-sided heads with regular expressions and then various different exposed to Chi or Comical expressions. Topped off with brilliant head pieces. Crug is no exception, he's also a great color for crocodile all dark browns with a lower silver jaw on his head piece. (Also part of the facial print.) The only thing missing here is the torso armor to hold the Chi stud and a weapon for him to wield.</p>
<p>Overall this is a great little Polybag for the asking price, it let's you get a Crug mini-figure cheaply, gives you another Chi Crystal for your growing collection and includes a nice little model that fits in well with the Crocodile Tribe's theme and colors. I recommend this one for everyone who is a fan of Polybags, LoC and impressively detailed Mini-Figures.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
