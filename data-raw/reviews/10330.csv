Though most of the pieces included are fairly common one of the few&nbsp;notable ones is the the split curved-slope piece placed at the front of the bike that helps make an otherwise boxlike vehicle into a smooth(ish) crime-fighting bike.<br><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Building Experience: </b>Nothing about the the building experience was very notable though one thing I noticed was a similarity to the spider-cycle from 76004 both when building and viewing the final result.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Playability:</b>&nbsp;On its own this set is not much to play with but that's forgivable seeing as it's limited by being a poly-bag. When combined with other sets however the potential for play is through the roof and Robin finally receives the first vehicle, from the Super Heroes theme, made specifically for him (no more asking Batman for the keys to the Bat-mobile)</div><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures: </b>Seeing as he's the titular character it makes sense that Robin appears as the only minifigure in his standard black hair w/ fringed cape outfit.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Value for Money:</b>&nbsp;Being one of the biggest poly-bags released for the Super Heroes theme this set is certainly worth the standard $4.99 CAD price for poly-bags. However this set is currently only available through a special promotion from TRU Canada and while almost certainly fetch a higher price on the secondary market and anyone looking to buy this set should wait until it inevitably becomes available for purchase.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Verdict:</b>&nbsp;Buy it but wait until it becomes more widely available.</div>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,4
