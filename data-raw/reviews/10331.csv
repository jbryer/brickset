<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Iron Man Mk 6 Armor is cheaper to acquire 
<li>Spare Parts for Repulsor Effect 
<li>Fighting Drone is Unique</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Price Per Piece Ratio not very good 
<li>Very little in the way of building 
<li>No rare Mini-Figure Prints</li></ul>
<p>This is an attempt to try a new Review Template, honestly with this Polybag all you really need to know is that you can get the Mk 6 Iron Man cheap and the build isn't really worth the price of admission. LEGO could have done so much better, enough parts to build two or three Fighting Drones as part of the set (they don't take up that many pieces) might have made this a worthy polybag. As it is, the only thing recommending it is the fact that, if you never bothered with Loki's Cosmic Cube Escape from last year then you can get the Mark 6 Iron Man armor from Iron Man 2/Avengers much cheaper than spending money on the larger set.</p>
<p>Polybag collectors will probably grab these up, keep'em sealed though, they aren't worth opening.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,2,3

<p>Small plastic bag containing a one page instruction.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Very small number of parts, mainly some curved and technic pieces which make up the drone and the minifig pieces with translucent blue studs and round bricks which make up Iron Man&#39;s energy projection.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Iron Man in his Mark 6 (it is officially called&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/sh015/Iron-Man-with-Triangle-on-Chest"" style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Iron Man with Triangle on Chest</a><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">) outfit which comes with Tony Stark-headpiece and an Iron Man helmet to go over.</span></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very fast little build with only 24 pieces.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Iron Man figure and a mini fighting drone which has a flick fire missile with green top.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great way to get an Iron Man minifigure !<br />
However that being said, as it is with some polybags, the price/piece ratio is horrible (over 20c/p).<br />
<br />
I feel that this polybag would have been perfect if lego included 2 of the fighting drones.<br />
It would have added some pieces (bringing the price/piece ratio to about 13c/p) and would have made for a small little battle scene.<br />
<br />
All in all though I do not regret getting this polybag and if you want an Iron Man minifigure I highly recommend this.</p>
