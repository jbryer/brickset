<p>
 Normally Google Maps can be relied upon to find the location of specific stores in strange&nbsp;cities&nbsp;but on this occasion it was useless. The nearest one to my hotel was apparently 2 miles away. But, I had time to kill so I walked to it, only to find when I got there it was not a &#39;proper&#39; Netto but a small food-only store. Being close to the city centre by this time, I walked into town, and on the way stumbled across another small branch. Still no joy.</p>
<p>
 Later that evening, I met up with Chris, <em>wiredforsound</em>, in the city and told him of my failure. He then said that there was a large Netto right next to the place he was staying, just 10 minutes from the hotel! So, on our way back home,&nbsp;we took a short detour to&nbsp;this branch and arrived just before it closed at 10pm. We found three solitary, lonely, polybags left: three <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=30183-1"" title=""View set details"">30183</a> Little Car, and, according&nbsp;to a shelf stacker, no more&nbsp;out the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
 The windscreen in particular is terrible and to make it worse there&#39;s a white&nbsp;plate in the middle underneath, making it look very un-uniform.</p>
<p>
 It fills a gap in my collection, but other than for that reason, I really can&#39;t recommend you take the trouble to track this one down. It&#39;s rubbish -- no wonder it was the only one left in the store!</p>

Obviously, it's pretty basic and insanely easy to build, but you can't really expect wonders from a 4â‚¬ set and this is not why they are made for anyway.<br><br>The parts are common and mostly in black, so I wouldn't recommend buying this just for parts.<br><br>In my opinion, it's worth the price. This is no masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but a decent little set for Creator and polybag collectors and also a good way to introduce Lego to kids.<br>",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2016-08-01T23:03:16.353Z","A Little Car that May Be a Bit Dissapointing.","<p><strong>Set #30183 Little Car: </strong>Here comes another Polybag review from LEGO Creator, this is a bit more recent compared to some of the others. This set is known as the Little Car and it&rsquo;s basically a small automobile to build and have fun with. Is it worth tracking down if you missed it? Read on and we&rsquo;ll see.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Fast and easy build should take between six and ten minutes to complete, giving a fun model to play with once finished.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model is compact and designed relatively well.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Windshield design could use a bit better parts use.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>As I said when I reviewed the Fast Car, a similar vehicle based Polybag from 2014 it&rsquo;s difficult to find anything to really call this set out on, and as far as the pros of the set go it can be a bit weaker. Honestly the best thing to discuss about the set is the fact that it&rsquo;s a cheap fun little model that offers something to build and play with. This is what LEGO Creator and LEGO in general is all about. That being said I&rsquo;d recommend tracking this down if you can, I have a preference for these vehicles and it&rsquo;s difficult to say no to them.</p>

<p>I do however understand it may not be everybody&rsquo;s interest, if you aren&rsquo;t a fan of Creator it&rsquo;s definitely safe to skip.</p>
