There are only two parts that I did not already own in this set, the stone gray part used as the base of &nbsp;the helicopter and the translucent light blue cockpit. &nbsp;The minifigure appears in three sets this year, with this set being at just over $3, this is the cheapest way to obtain the minifigure this year. &nbsp;Playability is average for a helicopter without any special features, but can be improved by adding a stretcher next to the cockpit. &nbsp;Value for the money is average being at $3.47 and containing 33 pieces. Overall, for this price point, it is a good helicopter&nbsp;",FALSE,4,5,3,4,3

<p>The model uses 33 pieces, is quick and easy to build and has a lot of interesting elements/build methods. The bubble protecting the officer from the front is a nice new piece, well new to me, and attaches pretty cleverly. I actually prefer this method to older sets with protective bubbles I've owned.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of nice colors with this set, plain white isn't that impressive, but the dark blue colored elements are a nice change of pace from the more common black coloring with Police sets. The rotor spins quite freely, sometimes you'll find these things getting stuck, not on this set though.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is a great new style of officer, he's basically part of the LEGO City Undercover style of City Mini-Figures introduced this year, he's got a rich dark blue torso and legs with printing on them, double-sided torso printing that includes a lot of details. With pockets, zippers, his badge and a few other items I'm not 100% sure on. He's wearing the standard white helmet with clear visor.</p>
<p>Overall this set, for a Polybag is a pretty plain safe offering, but it's fun little design, the great new style of Police Officer (Which has long been needed for LEGO City) really helps it to stand out from past offerings of a similar nature. You definitely can't go wrong tracking this one down.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
