<p>As far as polybag Star Wars mini-models are concerned this is a pretty decent looking representation of the ship in question, based on the precursor to the Rebel Alliance's familiar X-Wing Starfighter the Z-95 Headhunter has been seen in the Clone Wars, the ship has two distinct wings that do not seperate as the X-Wing does and if memory serves doesn't rely on Astromechs for navigation. Though I could be off on that.</p>
<p>The model looks great, it uses 54 pieces with a simple easy to follow build and includes some great pieces including a few 3-1 smooth plates in white and maroon. The rear engines also use c-clip pieces that allows them to move up and down.</p>
<p>Overall I feel that this is a great little polybag worth picking up, a great parts pack and a faithful little model to put on the shelf amongst all the rest. I do wonder though why the wings don't have any maroon pieces on them, the look of the ship is kind of mismatched when the entire front fusilage has maroon pieces while the wings are entirely white except for the wing cannons.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
