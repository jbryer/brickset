However I need to be honest and call'em as I see'em and this is a rather poor Polybag offering from LEGO.</p>
<p>To begin with this is a Miniature version of the Mandalorian Fighter, a vessel used by the Death Watch in the Clone Wars cartoon show. I've seen episodes where this ship appears very recently, the ship in the show is quite impressive and has great color choices, plus works very well. The ship in the polybag, suffers from bland color choices (Blue with White, far too much White I might add) and also is just all around ungainly as far as ships go.</p>
<p>It isn't entirely bad, it does capture the look of the ship relatively closely for this scale, it even features the rotating wings with some clever use of Technic pieces. Unfortunately the design of the ship is a bit of mess and not as iconic as something like... Say the B-Wing, a vessel that also rotates from a horizontal position into a vertical position for flight. The Gauntlet isn't bad, but it doesn't have much to offer here, expect possibly the parts. As it does use a nice Technic Connector piece that I haven't seen before as part of the wing assembly to simulate the rotational abilities of the ship.</p>
<p>Overall, unless you're looking for a good cheap parts pack, or you're a fellow fan of Polybags like atkinsar, this is one I'd definitely say is safe to skip over. And it's really a shame, because the episodes where this ship is prominent really make you want to have some decent representation of it, and with all the recent Polybagged mini-scaled ships that look great I was hoping this would be another great set. Sadly the designers just didn't capture it well enough, if there had been more of the Mandalorian Blue instead of the bland and broing white color used this ship might have scored higher. Eight blue pieces were used in total, the rest are all white, or gray, the cockpit is a nice transparent blue though so that's a bonus. It might have helped LEGO a bit to include parts to build a stand of some sort so that it could sit on&nbsp;a shelf in simulated flight, that too is a bit troublesome because displaying it only in landed mode isn't the best for display.</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,2,2
