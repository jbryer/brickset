<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The set comes in a poly bag. It&#39;s instructions are a flip book which has several pieces and could be complicated to a beginner.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Most of the parts are red and grey.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>The parts help with the build to maintain a streamlined shape. The cylinder also helps with this. The tri-engines are cool. It takes approximately 5 to 10 minutes to build.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict</p>

<p>This is a really good set and is vital for micro scale Clone attacks.</p>
