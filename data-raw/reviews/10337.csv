And most of them offer a great deal for your dollar.</p>
<p>The Umbaran MHC (Or Mobile Heavy Cannon) is a massive vehicle shrunk down to mini-model scale. The colors and the build of the model make this look somewhat similar to Seperatist Spider-Droids found in Mini-Figure scale sets, but it does represent the larger model faithfully and impressively.</p>
<p>The cool blues with the gray pieces have a uniform look to them that is just eye catchingly fun, the six legs are all quite mobile to accomplish several different poses, the cannon on the top is fairly simple looking but works well in this scale.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this is one Polybag you should definitely try to track down, good for parts in useful colors and a fun looking model. Another great offering from LEGO's 2013 Polybags.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3

<p>Comes in normal polybag bag and has the normal size polybag&nbsp;instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There aren&#39;t any special or unique pieces in this set. Although getting the blue pieces was really nice. The total piece is 48.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Was really simple and easy. It took me less than 2 minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My overall opinion is that this is a great mini walker. Getting the blue was nice since it isn&#39;t as common as some other color pieces. It is great for display or to play with. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
