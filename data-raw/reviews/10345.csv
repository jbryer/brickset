<p>The Lego flamingo from 2013 is a very nice build with great interesting pieces in pink .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>Starting at the head using the snot technique for the whole build is really interesting the black small claw makes for a great beak and the 1&times;1 pink snot bricks make the eyes . The neck just had some sloping detail to get the windy shape , the wings are a very nice part useage and the legs are affective in design .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>I have a lot of nostalgia for this set and still like to get the occasional monthly mini model build would definitely recommend this set for fans of brick built animals.</p>
