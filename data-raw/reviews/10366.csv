"Nesquik","2013-08-17T14:46:00.623Z","A simple, but effective model","The Loe Ranger products have, so far, been very generous in giving away the main characters across a broad range of products, so it's understandable that this little 'Pump Car' polybag may go unnoticed.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>But that's not to say that the minifigure alone is predictable, because the pump car itself is a very nice little model. TLG have released very few of these train-tracking contraptions; this is more than likely down to the fact that they're neither compatible with motors or anywhere else other than a train layout.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Take away the decent Lone Ranger 'figure and what you have is an excellent model for either display MOCs or as part of a play set-up. The choice of colours are very attractive, and the build is incredibly simple. The only downfall is that when a 'figure stands on the car, there is no room to push/pull the lever up and down, whereas the dynamic image on the polybag itself gives the impression of this action. Never mind...</div><div><br></div><div>So while not an essential Lego set even for collectors, the pump car is a fun model that will provide plenty of inspiration for your own designs. It's traditional (or more specifically, western) theme will fit in nicely with any steam age locomotives in your collection.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is on a 4&times;6 reddish brown plate , with the pin build consisting of technic,clips and bars and the wheels are the standard Lego train wheels that can go along Lego train track elements .</p>
