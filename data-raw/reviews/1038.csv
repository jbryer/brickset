And not to forget the two maxifigs (?), mother and daughter. Obviously marketed at girls, to which my niece can attest. She loves this set and especially the fact that you have to rebuild the figures to change their posture. A brilliant set as such, but not much re-usability in the parts. OK, the maxifigs have become statues in my layout.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
