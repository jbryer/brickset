<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Curve your Duplo track layout!</li><li>The trains don't fall off easily!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>You can't attach them to your building plates.</li><li>Not many tracks.</li><li>You must have a train first!</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>You just get 4 tracks in this set. Of course it's cheap, so you can get more. These&nbsp;are&nbsp;my only curved tracks I own, so I'm happy to own this set. The irritating thing is that, like in City tracks, you can't&nbsp;attach&nbsp;these tracks to plates.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, this is a great Train&nbsp;accessory, but only get it if you have a&nbsp;train!</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,3
