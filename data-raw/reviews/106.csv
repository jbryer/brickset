A 400 plus piece set in a fairly small sized model.  Look the working steering system and the look of the cockpit and motor.  My only criticism is the new hinge system pieces included in the trunk and the lack of change in the instructions.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"vhtf_hw_lego","2007-05-12T00:33:13.807Z","Thinking of different colours for the Hotrod &amp; Roadster? ","If that you have the intentions of building the Hotrod other than the original Blue. 

The Hotrod will be available only in White or Dark Stone &amp; Roadster in Black, Dark Stone, Old Gary, Red or White. I discovered that Lego does not produce all parts in different colours unless they require. 

For the Hotrod: 'Slope Brick 45 4 x 4 Double with Locking Hinge' (part 44571) is limited to only White &amp; Dark Stone. Other colours for the locking hinge as it has a limitation as one of the most important piece, 'Arch 1 x 3 x 2 with Curved Top' (part 6005) is not available in other colours. You will need to accept one slight difference in colours for the connecting of the rear hood of the Hotrod. 'Hinge Plate 1 x 4 Locking with 2 Single Fingers on Side Vertical' (Part 44568) is only available in Blue, MdStone, OldGray, Red &amp; White. 

For the Roadster: 'Arch 1 x 3 x 2 with Curved Top' (part 6005), the most important piece is only available other then blue is white &amp; Dark Stone. 

I wanted to build it in Yellow and then I discover the above problems. 

Hope the above helps and if you need the inventory parts for building Hotrod &amp; roadster in the mention colours, I should be able to forward to you.  

We have 3 more for you as we will need one for ourselves.

Thanks &amp; B.Rgds

"Ape_Fight","2009-12-31T10:20:16.543Z","1995 Hot Rod Original","I have the 1st release of this set from 1995, and I love it! The average score here seems a bit low to me.

The set is very robust (unlike some Model Team Sets), has brilliant decals, looks pretty accurate (although the interior with its one big armchair is perhaps the weakest point) and has a few functions too.

The model only has working steering and an opening boot, which is well below some Model Team sets, but it's pretty small and made to a price.

Asthetically, one of the best Model Team sets ever, and thanks to a re-release there should be plenty about.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
