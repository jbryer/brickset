It's a real shame this will be the last time we see Mearsk Blue because it's a very ncie colour, a sort of cool minty blue, looks great with the other LEGO blues so will make nice highlights.
Theres a nice array of parts lots of Maersk blue, dark red makes up the lower hull and theres plenty of new chocolatly brown, slightly blue light grey and white, even if you dont like the set its worth it for the parts lots of white and grey tiles, plates and bricks which make up the cargo containers.
The cargo conatainers are abit of a drag to make, you have to amke 46 of them completly identical!
The only reason this set didn't get a 10 was due to the heavey use of stickers, it would ahve been much nicer to have the Mearsk logo printed on the side of the bricks but insted we get LOTS od stickers!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-10T16:29:10Z","I LOVE this set!","I just got done building this one and I'm very impressed with the finished model.  There are a lot of hidden details such as staircases, doors (window pieces), and the radar pieces really spin.

I too wish that the bricks were printed vs. MANY stickers.

If these sell well perhaps LEGO will release other ships in this scale.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set was offered to me by a Lego employee that I met at a conference (for business purposes!). I did not give him a break until he finaly shipped one to me. Then Lego released it again on Shop at home... Anyway Lego should make more boats...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
