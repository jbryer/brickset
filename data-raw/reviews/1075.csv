I like the colours, yellow and red and the whole machine just yells LOCOMOTIVE and MACHINE. It's a great starter set. It includes an electric loc, a driver (in black), a passenger wagon, a passenger (female, no boyfriend), 12 curved rails, 2 straight rails, 2 red direction pieces and some extra train station bits. And this is yet again were the strenght of lego comes in. Even with this 'older'set you can still build on and even ad the newest train sets. I have found only one mayor problem (in my eyes). When building with lego duplo the curved pieces of the track don't fit on the groundplate. This is very anoying. Besides that it's a great train set, even the sound of the train leaving or changing direction is a wonderfull sound. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
