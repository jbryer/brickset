But one engine with motor is also sufficient to pull my four waggons, but the motor has to struggle in curves. So if you have four or more waggons that are approximaltely as long and heavy as the Santa Fe waggons, I'd recommend two motors. In other words, if you use one or two motors depends on how heavy the whole train is. If you have set 4511 + 10157 + 10158, one motor is sufficient. All three sets combined form a very light train. 

This motor comes with only two wheels on one side. With 12V motor 7865, you could add one wheel on each side. You could also put a connecting rod on the three wheels of one side. With motor 10153 this is not possible, though I've seen some pictures of 9V motors with six wheels and connecting rod. Some people seem to be able to modify them. 

Don't use this motor to push waggons! I mean you can do that, but these motors have become precious since they are out of production. If you use it to push waggons, you'll probably reduce its life-expectancy. Pushing is hard work for this motor. You'll also reduce its life-expectancy if you use only one motor for a heavy train and let the whole train run for several hours. Don't let the motor get overheated!

And remove the plates at the bottom (middle upside down constuction) of the sets 10022 and 10133! Those plates must be substituted by tiles. The studs of the plates touch the surface of curves. This causes friction, and the motor has to struggle. This reduces the motor's life-expectancy as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
