"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-07T22:15:04Z","Freeby from Legoshop.com!","           This set is very nice, it comes with some very nice yellow pieces and merges into a fine looking truck. The guy has some cool blue jumpsuit on and a cap, and he drives the lego truck. The truck is the easiest thing to build, simple, and perfect for a town with alotta roads. I cant believe a set with this value was put in front of the crowd free at legoshop.com! Otherwise, it is 14$ USD (Which is a tad bit expensive for a small set like this one) so I would've snayched it while it was free (Or is it still?). Anyway, enough of that jazz, an overall great set with a lot of playability, an exquisite 9'ner!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"chanying13","2006-02-19T10:57:44Z","Eye Catching Truck ","The colour (yellow and silver) of the truck will catch your attention at once.  

I just thought the front of the truck should be wider (6).  Being 4 unit wide, Large portion the front wheel is exposed.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"mrmitch","2007-06-06T03:24:19.45Z","Great truck - like all the chrome pieces!!","I got this set today threw S@H they had it marked down to just 5 USD (only last 2 days-sold out now). I was very impressed with this set, easy to build the truck driver looks great. Cons: It has stickers they are so hard to center and get on straight. Really like the chrome, makes it look like a big rig truck. I recommend this truck, its good looking and has some unique pieces to boot.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-05T20:52:36.093Z","Bright and Shiny","Just got this set a couple of days ago. Target got them as an exclusive, so being about three years old already I thought I'd better get one.

The truck itself is quite cool, nice shape, nice proportion, opening doors and roof. Lots of chrome pieces including grill, smoke stacks and air horns really make the model stand out. This blended in with the yellow color make the truck say love me, don't judge me.

The mini-fig is dressed in blue pants, hat and jacket, with printing on his jacket. His face is the sunglasses and smile.

This model is not without fault thou. Stickers, I hate stickers. On this model they are so awkward to get straight and center it isn't funny. There is no place on the back to hook a trailer if you wanted to. The two hand rails at the back are only held on by one clip each. The cab annoys me slightly also. The windscreen is too long and prevents the driver from getting out of the door properly. Still when you consider this model for it's size and was a freebie these issues can be fixed (except stupid stickers).

Overall a very nice model for display or good fun to truck around in. I feel this model is deserving of a 6/10. Although it has a few minor faults, it was designed as a promo item and will be rated as such. If you can get hold of one, I would recommend it, as I am sure it will become a rarity in years to come.

P.N. It is exactly the same as 3442 (Another promo) except for th color scheme.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-11-25T13:25:41.56Z","Great Reissue","I was in my Dark Ages when this set was originally produced. I am glad that it was reissued recently so that I could add this beauty to my collection. This is a very detailed set that deserved reissuing. It is designed with details and realism in mind. The LEGO logo stickers are great (too bad they are not printed logos on bricks though). The chrome parts are a bonus and the yellow color pops. I would have been upset if I found this set on peeron or brickset and didn't have a chance to own it new. Instead I found it in a LEGO Catalog last year and now I own it.
Keep on truckin'!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"petro17sq","2008-09-09T16:19:42.06Z","Special set","This is a very special set for me
My girlfriend (now my wife) gave me this set back in 2004 went she travelled to Orlando and went to the Lego store in Disney Down Town.
It is the only set I have that is a Lego exclusive product.
The chrome pieces are hard to get and they look quiet nice,.
The truck is very nice, I like the yellow colour and the Lego stickers are cool (I prefer printed bricks but for this sets it is ok with stickers)
The truck has and small compartment in the back when you can almost put another minifigure inside.
The blue minifigure with the sunglasses is cool to.
It has nice doors that you can open and close and you can also open the roof of the truck to put the minifigure inside.
In conclusion in my opinion this set deserve 5/5
