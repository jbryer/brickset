I love lego aircraft and sense this one seemed so appealing and real, I ordered it for 14 bucks. It is a nice set that comes with the average town citizen heads and neat suits. One suit is the ground crew person torso with the plane patch, the pilots suit is darkened grey with some little gauge on it, by the way, it comes with the best jet fighter helmet. The other suit was the none-to-special blue zipper suit. The plane model is very sturdy and if it does break in any case, it is cake to buld it back. The red fuselage is expecially cool with lego! Inside the cockpit is a neat flight com. with joystick I think! A great cockpit considering past ones. It comes with cool hinged tail-planes that can be straight or slanted. I wish the cockpit was inclosed but it doesnt entirely matter. On each wing tip there is little square lights (Red/Green) and on the back is an exclusive type of jet nozzle appendage that can move up and down, like a STOVL plane. The only cons in this model is that inside of the fuelage is a little engine piece that rattles around when the craft moves. This set also is equipped with a tool-holder with computer, and a cool tanker vehicle equipped with a gas mask for the dude driving it. I highly recommend this set for anyone. Also check out my reviews for the Rescue Chopper model and the Explorien Starship! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The plane is also cool with a place for the driver, storage, and landing gear.  To make it even better Lego added in the mechanic's tools and the gas tank fueler thing.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
