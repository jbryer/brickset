"legotrainfan","2007-10-18T12:11:06.53Z","Necessary for set 4511","I consider this set to be simply necessary for train set 4511. By adding it to 4511, the whole train looks better and more complete. 4511 simply IS complete with it.

However, there are some negative things about it I must mention. The criticism that follows is the same as for set 4511: there aren't any train doors. Then there is this big piece in the front. Several smaller bricks would have been better. With smaller bricks you could transform the engine into a waggon or another engine more easily. Apart from this, the whole thing would look nicer without that big piece. And this set comes with the new bluish gray colours! I have set 4511 with the old gray colours. I am not 100% sure, but I heard that set 4511 had also been produced with bluish gray bricks later. But my 4511 with old gray bricks doesn't look good when 10157 (with bluish gray bricks) is added. It's a terrible colour mix!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-12-11T07:07:20Z","Next Destination...","This &quot;special edition&quot; train is simply a cheap knock-off of the train in set 4911, but without the engine (hence the cheap knock-off part).  Basically, it's the driver compartment together with the first class compartment of the train and 2 minifigs - the train driver and a female passenger.

Looks-wise, the train seems weird and out of balance, particularly the additional &quot;nose&quot; beneath the nose of the train, which interrupts the sleek &quot;bullet&quot; lines of the train and introduces an &quot;open-mouth&quot; look instead.  Design-wise, there's no door on the train, which seems the norm for Lego trains.  However, it also lacks internals to the carriage which seems a bit out of place for Lego trains (and again gives it the cheap knock-off category).

On its own, it's really useless, however, this seems to be for the Train completists to create their own World City passenger train together with 10158 and 4911.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-05-23T01:05:28.263Z","Useful addition.","On its own this doesn't serve much of a purpose, but when added to the otherwise incomplete 4511 the two sets combine to make what is actually one of the better intercity-type trains of recent years.  True, I still think the front looks a tad strange (kind of like a theme park train with a shark mouth) but it's a much-needed purchase if you have 4511, certanly makes for a much better train than 7897.

"penguin3332","2008-06-01T11:27:30.95Z","High Speed Train (part 1)","I really liked this set for allot of practical reasons.  My old high speed train was getting old and so I wanted a new one to replace the old one.  This set looks great by itself and with the car that is sold separately.

Nice Things-
-Includes two mini figs, a World City train driver and a woman with a ticket
-The nose of the engine makes it seem like a fast train, plus there are no gaps between it and the engine
-It has a nice &quot;door&quot; like bricks at the end to make it look connectible to another car
-It looks good by itself, or with the High Speed Train Car

Dislikes-
-The train nose cone is one part (however I like it better that way)

Overall, This was a great addition to my town, and I hope it will be to your town too.
