"penguin3332","2008-06-01T11:51:11.06Z","High Speed Train (part 2)","This is a nice train car for every town layout.  Because it is sold individually you could make a whole train from this and the High Speed Locomotive.

Nice Things-
-Includes two mini figs, a secret agent with badge and suitcase and a tourist with suitcase, camera, and back pack
-Includes two tables with for chairs plus two cups
-Cargo container in back is removable, either by forklift or crane
-Car has nice &quot;door&quot; like wall at end
-The car is very long

Dislikes-
-When you remove the cargo container in back there is an open wall in the back
-The tourist mini figs face looks horrible
-You need and engine to use the car

Overall, This is a good set, but since it is useless without an engine I gave it a four.  It is nice and big, and will make a good train car for the High Speed Locomotive.

"StormSworder","2009-04-03T20:44:30.467Z","Useful as an add-on, but not really that inspiring.","What is there to say about this?  It's a clone of the passenger section from 4511.  As an addition to 4511, I suppose it's worth it if you want to make that decidedly short train longer.  But they could have done something different with it, like had a sink or a buffet.  Instead it's identical.  As for the minifigs.  One of them looks like a Lego version of Harry Enfield's character Big Bob Joyglove (about to bribe a train driver with a load of cash in that suitcase, perhaps?)  The other is just irritating, shows how a lot of Lego themes seemed to be set in a cartoon world rather than the real world.  And one other thing - where exactly are the doors!?!
