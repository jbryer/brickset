"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-29T14:00:45Z","this set rocks!!!","This set is really cool. There are alot of minifigures,(i believe about 12). The jet looks like it is a private jet, and there is a transport copter. The terminal is also pretty cool, as it has a bag check, aa dining area, and a flight plan thingy. Although this was cool, I wish that Lego had kept the colors original and not the new colors. Otherwise, this was a cool set and was worth the money. I recommend this to all lego fans and collectors of city legos.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-24T12:22:38Z","Terrific","I bought this set for my kid, and I must admit that I probably enjoyed it more than him. So many cute little vehicles, a check in, two bars, two helicopters and an executive airplane.
All along with 12 minifigs, plants and flowers and so many decorative parts.

On Lego shop at home its 100 euros, so I think its the best offer I ever got with Lego. It comes with 12 minifigs, the 3 airport workers have been given a new torso to match the 2006 airport workers(I'm not sure if it was mistake). It comes with 6 vehiciles which are: the plane, the helicopter,the cargo helicopter,the luggage car, the small tanker and the forklift. Great set!!.I think it's way better than the 2006 version .

"hustla187","2008-05-19T19:17:09.61Z","Enjoy this Set","I got this on Christmas day 2004 and it was an amazing set. It is fun to play with for hours. I like the airstrip and the airplane but the current planes Lego makes won't even fit on the strip. The buildings is very cool with the garage and security checkpoints. The helicopter is very cool with the double rotor and cargo carrier. The lookout tower is awesome and I like the minifig standing up there working. How does he get down though? This is one of my top 5 favorite sets I own and it is a Lego Legend! This is a highly must own for Lego lovers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Notable components include the spring-loaded forklift mechanism, the rolling garage door in blue, and the beloved multi-piece palm tree.

Its wealth of baseplates includes four 32x32s with three different printed designs (for the road and runways, one with a different print than in 1994), one 32x16 (for the terminal), and one 16x16 (for the control tower). Even with all of these baseplates, the runway, at 96 studs long, still feels absurdly short.

Indeed, it offers an idyllic vision of flying. Tellingly, the terminal incudes an x-ray machine but not a metal detector. Its original name of 1994, Century Skyway, expressed this breezy, optimistic, and evocative atmosphere better than the more descriptive City Airport of 2004. The &ldquo;AIROLINE&rdquo; logo, with a red globe in its center, is reminiscent of the Pan Am logo.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The juniorized town would be visualized, fully formed, in the advertising images for the road baseplates of 1997. Its apparently sudden emergence remains puzzling. How did what is widely regarded as the golden age of Town give way so quickly to the reviled constructions of the late &rsquo;90s and early &rsquo;00s?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

It remains appropriately modernist and transparent for an airport, but its design mirrors that of a variety of other sets, and followed closely on the similar 6393 International Jetport of 1990. Both of these airports closely resemble other large-scale buildings of the early &rsquo;90s: 6398 Central Precinct HQ (1993), 6571 Flame Fighters (1994), 6598 Metro PD Station (1996).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Important differences remain: 10159 and its peers use plate, rather than brick floors, and fewer one-piece walls and chassis. Juniorization proper uses a different vocabulary of pieces but its grammar is similar and it offers a similarly totalizing style. In large buildings of the early &rsquo;90s we witness the emergence of an attitude that buildings can and should have similar profiles despite divergent functions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

"BionicleBOOM","2008-12-01T21:10:07.873Z","I own this set... and glad of it!!","Unfortunately I have this downstairs in a Rubbermaid container as I don't have any place to put it in my room (it is quite large after all), and I've traded the forklift and helicopters for some Bionicles from my brother.  They haven't been seen since. :(  Otherwise, my set is complete and I really like it.  The airplane, of course, is kinda cramped inside, only having room for five minifigs including the pilot, but it's good.  The control tower is very detailed, as well as the terminal with its tables, chairs, counter, and flight plan.  The landing pad for the small helicopter has a garage underneath for the various vehicles.  Overall a great set.

"charlotteslego","2010-10-21T08:54:35.497Z","Best LEGO City Airport to date.","<p>This is one of the first sets I ever got, when it first came out in 2004. At the time, I was too young to appreciate the scale and detail of LEGO sets, but looking at it now, I am delighted to say that it's&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;the most eye-catching part of my vast LEGO City.</p><h4>The Airplane:</h4><div>It may be a little small compared to most recent airports, with the main body being only 4 studs wide, but it still occupies up to 4 passengers and a driver/pilot easily; though some head wear proves to be too much for the small design and it sometimes doesn't shut properly. The wheels are very realistic, but the front one seems to get jammed when you push the plane along (whether or not this happens to everyone else's, I have no clue) which is slightly annoying, but bearable. The luggage compartment is a nice little touch too, and the wingspan is a good size: not out of proportionally small, and not spilling over the sides of the runway. Overall, very standard and decent, but not&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;well made.</div><h4>The Cargo Helicopter:</h4><div>I adore this little addition to the set, it's realistic, practical and has many uses. There are little doors on the rear which I don't see a purpose to, but they are good all the same: might as well use them if they're there. Movement of the wheels and propellers are great, and the loading shelf is perfect height for the forklift, which has clearly been well thought out.&nbsp;</div><h4>Other Vehicles:</h4><div>Firstly, the forklift: very realistic and co-ordinates with the cargo helicopter well. The boxes provided fit perfectly, though it sometimes over balances. Octan fuel car: cute little touch, though I can't actually see a fuel&nbsp;compartment&nbsp;on any of the vehicles. Can't complain, though. Stairs and luggage transport: the car itself is standard, though the luggage bay is quite cool. I have a few problems with the stairs though, surely with such a standard design you could make the vehicle so that it can reverse to the side of the plane, disconnect and then drive off: the stairs should have been fixed on the other way. However, it's not a big deal and you can always build the stairs with the car fixing on the other side, or just sin the stairs around once they've been disconnected. Helicopter: standard, cute. No purpose but still good all the same.</div><h4>Airport &amp; Runway:</h4><div>The runway is good; I haven't seen a LEGO set with a runway included since this, which makes it entirely different from more recent designs, though it should be longer. Not a problem if you can hunt around for identical plates. I personally love the little roundabout, which I haven't seen before: very cute. The lookout tower is quite clever, with not much building required though it produces quite a cool addition to the set. However, the random 16x16 square makes the set a little awkward to fit into a City: there will always be blank gaps. The airport itself makes great use of the little space provided: with a helicopter pad on top of the garage, a bridge above the driveway, and in places, three floors of fun. Inside there's a &nbsp;restaurant, which is good but there could've been something more relevant in its place: a waiting area with a time screen perhaps? The reception features a desk, standard, and some lockers which I find quite cool. &nbsp;The time/location table&nbsp;protrudes beyond the base plate, which I see no point in, but it's still there nevertheless. There's also a little luggage scanning belt inside, which fits a regular suitcase nicely, and is a wonderful little touch.</div><h4>Conclusion:</h4><p>Overall, very good and realistic. I recommend to anyone looking for a LEGO Airport, rather than the newer sets.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
