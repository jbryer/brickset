This is an important set for the Duplo Dino range. It is the only set with a pterodactyl that a duplo caveman can sit on, as far as I know. Pterodactyl has a 2x2 stud back, same as the other 'adult' Dinosaurs. As for the extra peices that came with it, I can't remember, but probably an extra peice of 1x2x2 brick fruit, grapes most likely.

I combined this with a few farm sets and the rest of the dino series to make a LEGO Duplo Garden of Eden.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
