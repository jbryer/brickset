Six big wheels, a flashing siren on the roof and a lot of room for bricks in the back. This set says HEAVY MACHINERIE, MOVE!!! It's very nice to build large duplo buildings and park these machines (2807 and 2808) under them. Again the lego logo(try saying that ten times fast) on the side, which gives these simple machines the uniform look. I for one would like to see some more of these BRICK moving machines. They feed your emagination with dreams of big building sites. And that is what lego is all about BUILDING. Even for the little ones amongst us who just started there legoing career!!!!!!!!!!!
