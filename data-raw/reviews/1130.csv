She's been playing with it ever since (along with some other DUPLO sets), and finds endless enjoyment in it.  The pieces are so generic in their design that it really offers many possibilities within the imagination of a child (and at times, an adult).

Sadly enough, this set seems to be very difficult to find.  I'd give it as a gift to other kids if I could actually find it for sale.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
