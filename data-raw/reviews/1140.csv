The Totem is quite colourful and dose looks strangely odd but it is built from prime colours and shades but still not one of my favourite pieces.

The Indian is in standard Indian dress of all brown and tan. His facial paint also looks really cool. He is carrying a quiver of arrows, a bow and a spear which are all black. He also has a neat Indian shield.

Overall this set is definitely a promo and I have honestly got no idea how I came across it all the way over hear in Australia. This set is a good way to help build up your armoury for weapons or your tribe of Indians or totems for your village if you really want them. I feel this set is scraping a 5/10 only because it is, was and always will be a promo item.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Well it kinda was too easy to put together. I'm sure you won't need longer than 3 minutes to build the totem pole. It looks very cool and it's very sturdy. In my opinion it's just an accessory to your LEGO Western collection. It's also a good army builder. But this set doesn't have any play features so the playability is a&nbsp; little bit bounded by. <br><br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br><br>Ideas:</span><br><br>This
