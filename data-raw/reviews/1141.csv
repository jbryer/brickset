"transfesa","2005-12-12T05:39:14Z","Great as a western river add-on","I got this little set as a promotion from a toothpaste company. It consists of an indian (girl?), a small kayak and many accesories, such as a bow, a spear, an axe and an oar. You also get a plant leaf and two feathers! Who could ask for more in a promotional pack?

Simply great if you want to complete a western layout with a river.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-06T14:48:53.937Z","Ok, another small western/indian set","This set is another small set of the western theme, indians subtheme. Released as a promo, this was cheap (of course, this was a promo, so it was free). The building of the Kayak consists in a long but no much big plate, increased with some encurved pieces above it and also a plant and longbow on the back, the both pices useful. The minifigure is an indian, simple but good designed, and the color scheme (some red in the kayak and different colors in the printed details of the minifigure) still nice. The playability, like the building and pieces (altough useful, the pieces are few), is simple. In comparison with other promo sets, this is another good, and of course, small, that can increase something on other bigger sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-08T04:03:52.49Z","I Went To The Great Spirit For A Canoe But All I Got Was This Lousy Kayak","Its not that bad actually and a kayak is a worthy addition to native boating though I think a full, open canoe should be better. Other native boats such as coracles and 'bull' boats would make some neat models and lake and river activity is not always given the attention it deserves in set releases.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>The best set parts: A colourful face paint print contrasting with subtly coloured leathers in a brilliant print with patterns. The feathers are a great touch in a lumpy black haircut. Gets a black axe, bow and quiver.</li></ul></div><div><b>River Rapid Rider</b></div><div>The red kayak is a pretty reasonable small set build. He/she sits in this giant red shoe with precariously exposed sides. Sometimes it might be nice to see MF positioning 'cheats' where the torso is sat atop bricks to make it appear as if it is inside, but a proper build is usually preferable.</div><div><br></div><div>So this rapids floatation transport is no doubt much extra totemic fun for the native population in the Western theme (will it please return?!) but where this set improves is the extra parts that fit on the boat. The interesting leafy green foliage could be one of three things:</div><div><ul><li>The warrior used leafy camouflage to desperately hide his brightly coloured kayak that could only approach unseen in a City Fire set.</li><li>Perhaps he struggled with the one oar and ripped through some riverside bushes.</li><li>TLG are representing a cedar log that he has freshly carved into a kayak with some leafy twig left for decoration.&nbsp;</li></ul>You decide. The best bricks though other than the smooth rounded canoe ends are the black bow and arrow and black axe. Now unfortunately this is the first Indian set I have with no other pieces yet to compare but these are very attractive alternatives to the usual brown and grey bits we see in other historical sets.<br><div><br></div><div>So all he needs now is a decent destination and a totem pole. It would be great to see an expansive return to this theme exploring various tribes, locations and a 'frontier' subtheme of Western.</div><div><br></div><div>No birch bark canoe, or even just a canoe but a pretty decent kayak thanks to the parts.The native is excellent&nbsp;though some tribal variation would be inventive in future native MFs.</div></div>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,2
