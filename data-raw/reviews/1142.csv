"Errex","2007-03-27T11:24:14.523Z","Bare minimum set.","Basically, what you get is a red minifig with a translucent alien head, a cool looking helmet and shoulderpads.

The rest are just a handful of rather plain plates and bricks, the most interesting being a couple of hinge plates.

Still, it was a fairly cheap little set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-03T11:48:45.177Z","Size Matters","This is a real small one. Consisting of a whole 10 pieces for the model plus five for the fig really says the budget for this set. The vehicle itself has two 2 wings. That's it. No seriously, it has a triangle bit at the front, no control pad and a fluoro yellow grate at the back, which is a rarer piece. Oh i forgot the wings are on hinges so add on another point.

The mini-fig is the best part of this model. Red/ Grey Space suit, Black chest plate and shoulder pads, cool fluoro orange head, with awesome face and helmet. Now as a child I hated the helmets. Thought the were ugly as, but i always looked at them from the top. Now i am older i appreciate the style of this helmet. Also tend to look at it from the side now too.

Overall I'm giving a 5/10 for this model. That 5 is boarder line. It is small, very small, so the playability is very limited. I wouldn't rush out to buy it, but if u see it somewhere at the right price grab one, even if it is just for the mini-fig. A tiny addition to any space set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-08T12:56:18.95Z","Just a promo","This is a promotional set, first from 1997, and it is little because is only a promo. The minifigure is great, like all ufo minifigures that have an armor and a helmet. Have promos that are more big, but this still good. The wings also can move. I rate 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-04T15:26:09.687Z","Its ok","The ship is pretty ugly, so the main reason to get this set eh is incredible minifigure. It looks truly mysterious and a very alien like creature. The ship itself is bad buts thats no the reason to buy it, the minifig is so this gets an 8.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-11-11T03:57:00.903Z","Very small, but very good","I know it has very few pieces, but it is still a great set. The ship, while miniscule, has cool wings that bend, and as good a design as a 10-piece ship can have. The mini-fig is also really good. Worth about 3 dollars, but still a lot of fun!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Parrotman707","2010-11-06T16:48:24.633Z","All right I guess","<p>This set is okay but THE SHIP HAS NO CONTROLS HOW IS THE ALIEN GUY GOING TO CONTROL IT. This set contains an awesome minifig which is why it manages to get a 2 out of 5. The minifig was the only reason I bought this set. Now for the pros and cons:</p>

 (2847) is a LEGO Space (UFO) set which came out in 1997. It comes
with 1 minifig and 15 pieces. This set does include no decals and 
there're no mistakes in the instructions and no missing pieces.<br><br><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span><span></span></span><span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/2847-1.jpg[/img]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><br><br><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigures:</span><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><br></span><span><span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Alien:</span></span> The alien comes with a gray uniform with some cool markings and red legs which are printed. He also has red arms and black hands and the alien also got a black armor with a gray helmet. The helmet has some very cool markings on it as well. The head of that minifig is transparent orange and it looks like a smiley face on it. I really like this alien figure and I think this set is one of the cheapest ways to get this minifig.</span></span><span><span><span><br><span><br><span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flyer:</span><br><br>The flyer<span><span><span><span><span><span> is very easy to build and I'm sure that you can build it within 5 minutes. It's not my favourite set of the LEGO Space (UFO) theme. There're no controls on this little model. How is the alien supposed to fly this vehicle? The only play feature we got is that the fins in the back are movable. I think this set is very nice for pieces but I would pick up other LEGO sets first before you get this one.<br><br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br>Great pieces which you can use for brickfilms or MOC's<br>Minifig<br>Great starter set<br><br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br>No play features<br>Too easy to build<br>No controls<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
