"Blade","2008-02-07T03:28:29.153Z","Soring on Magic","Just found this set and thought id better give it a review. This set is quite special as there are only two flying vehicles in the Fright Night series, One is a promo from the shell servo collection and this is the other.

The vehicle itself is quite simple based around an old school race car frame and equiped with a crystal ball, spears and a bat on the front. It is powered by a flame coming out of the back.

The mini-fig is Bat Lord. He is in his usual dress of grey pants, black belt, red top with black sleeves and a pattern on it. He also has the black bat shaped helmet. His face is a frown with a fringe, eyebrows and moustache. In this set he also come with the silver sword which was a mint piece when I was a kid.

Overall the model has quite good aesthetics and fits in well with the series. Like most small models they playability by itself isn't that good but when added into the series it plays it's part. I feel this model is a 5/10 or Average as it is a nice model that has no real flaws and lots of weapons but nothing super special either. I would say this model is a must for a castle fan or collector, even someone who likes flying models, this one is for you.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This includes some useful things, like the spears, a silver sword, and a crystal ball, also little fire lego pieces. The sword is larger than the grey ones, and the helmet have a bat-like form. The little set flying machine is great, and altough it don't have wings, still good. 5/5 for this well made set.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-09T10:08:52.113Z","LEGO Castle (Fright Knights) - Flying Machine Review","This is not one of my favourite sets of the LEGO Castle (Fright Knights) theme. The bat knight minifig is still a cool minifig. I like the way how LEGO designed the helmet with the bat fins on each side. It's a nice piece to have. The speeder looks cool, too but it doesn't have any play features. On the front we get a crystal ball and on we also get a spear on each side and a flame on the back. This impulse set also includes a bat and a sword for the knight figure. The set is really easy to build and we don't get any stickers which you've to worry about. This model is very sturdy as well. I like it but it's not my favourite set of this theme.&nbsp; I would recommend you to buy the bigger ones first before you get this model.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
