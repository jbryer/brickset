"Blade","2007-08-22T03:08:15.27Z","Nice Freebee","I acquired this model from some neighbours who got it in a biscuit tin which i also acquired. This is a very basic model for what it is. 19 pieces including mini-fig. This helicopter Has two rotors, one of which is the big, newer, solid, 1 piece one. It has two gear sticks for controls which fit nicely into the drivers hands when positioned correctly.

The mini-fig itself is the interesting part of this model dressed in all blue with a white helmet. The logo on his jacket is Octan. This doesn't make him an Octan model as his vehicle has no markings or colours of an Octan vehicle. I think he is either a racer and Octan are the sponsor or he is part of the Octan Racing team.

Overall It's a very simplistic model that came free with biscuits. Still a nice model though so a 5/10 from me. Nice if you collect town, helicopters, or anything to do with the Octan series. The real collectors item is the tin. It's quite big and looks really great. Mines in mint condition with the stickers on it. If a photo is wanted I would happily oblige.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to worry about stickers. This set may doesn't have any play features but it's still fun to maneuver it. The propeller on the top and on the back sviwel full 360Â°. It's a good set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
