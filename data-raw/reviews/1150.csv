This small set, 2870 - Paradisa Barbeque, is truly tiny.  There are only 15 bricks plus a minifig.  However, this set demonstrates the powerfulness of LEGO that you can use so few pieces to do a fanastic scene, as well as how you can make your own funny story but just such a few pieces.  

Among one of the legendary Paradisa theme, you got a pink dressed lady minifig.  Also, you have quite a few rare items including dark pink bricks and a black cat.

I easily created a lot of lovely scene out of this small set and enjoyed very much.  This is among the most valuable sets to collect! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I&nbsp;immediately added it to the rooftop of my Corner Garage (modular house), because I felt it was very bare up there. I&#39;ll be replacing the pink bricks, but the rest of the scene really fits so well.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;details in this set are great, the pizza, the grill, the pan. And the black cat! I have two myself, so that&#39;s a little something that connects me to the scene. The minifig wears&nbsp;a cute printed top, but I have seen the hair/face combo before.</p>

<p>I think this is a lovely set to add to a backyard, park or rooftop setting. Who&#39;s in for a bbq party?!</p>
