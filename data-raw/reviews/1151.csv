So when you compare what you get with what you pay/give in return I can't find a reason to give it a poor score, but not a perfect score.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-14T01:55:09.88Z","A Small Stash","This set is quite a mystery to me. I have no idea how it go in my collection or where it came from. I have the instructions, even though they aren't required and must go search for the box one day.

Really to look at this set it's not much piece wise and no vehicle. But really if you have a closer look you will be surprised. The mask for the helmet is shaped like goggles and had a snorkel. The mini-fig face is totally different to any other i have. The yellow Utensil Underwater Scooter he is holding is also a rarity appearing in only about 10 sets. 

This set comes with a shark. No big deal but the shark is white and a white shark appears in only about 9 sets. Also has a cutlass and a spear gun which are always nice to have more of.

The other really great thing about this set is its playability. As a child at home in the car, out this small compact set can use any environment for an adventure, unlike a truck or racer or one Bionicle for example, which would be much more limited and alot bigger.

Overall this set is a nice little set probably costing around $1.99 AU so you get what you pay for. I feel this model is still a solid 5/10 due to its parts and playability. A nice small set to take on a journey. A good addition to anyone who collects sea or town.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-31T12:09:48.327Z","Shark attack","For some random reason I've decided to do this review the strange way that I could think of; heres what I came up with.

One day Adimaral Ackbar was divin in the ocean in a disguise. He found some treasure in a barrel and a sword but then suddenly realised &quot;It's a trap!&quot;. A shark attacked him but he he shot it with a harpoon and then used his jet to get away.

That may seem random but it proves how this set has endless possibities of fun. It also cleverly displays all of this sets features.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-13T08:40:53.243Z","LEGO Town (Divers) - Diver and Shark Review","This is a great little set and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also don't get any stickers in this set. There's nothing much to build but we get a cool looking white shark and a great minifig as well. I really like the face of this figure. We also get a barrel with two studs and a sword. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great little set to have for little money - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

Very good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"canbayram","2017-12-13T12:59:53.833Z","A Fun Promotional Set","<p>I remember this tiny set given as a promotion by a National Newspaper. Set includes some rare parts such as underwater scooter, white shark, and also scuba tank and a cutlass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The playability is usually the con in a set this small, but this one has what it needs to resemble a complete scene. A possible treasure barrel sunk from a pirate ship (it has two translucent studs inside), a shark swimming around and defending it, and a scuba diver eager to find despite whatever it takes.&nbsp;</p>
