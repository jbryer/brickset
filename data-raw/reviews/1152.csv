"Novelty","2007-05-23T05:15:54.54Z","Bat's Wings and Spider's Legs","At first glance this seems to be parts thrown together randomly to form a set.  A closer inspection will show that it's rather well thought out and designed properly, eventhough the building of the set is close to minimal.  The only thing to build is the fireplace and although the design isn't awe-inspiring, it's functional and it has a mantle.  Then there's the crystal ball, the black cat and the witch with wand and a bat, all of which can be used for roleplay.  This set isn't just good for parts, it's also good for play if there's a little imagination.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Kiiranaux","2007-07-26T18:26:43.973Z","Perfect set for this witch:","This is a great set, for many reasons. You get a black cat, a fireplace, and a cool crystal ball. The wand is amazing (nice to see it used for something other than Bellville's good fairies- blech) as is the witch. Of course in MY legos, the witch will use a spell to get a more pretty face (what is it with steriotypical ugly witches?) and join Voldemort as Bellatrix Lestrange!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-20T18:32:27.14Z","Little set with a witch","This is a small set from the fright knights. But this series don't includes only knights, but too witches, like one in this set. She don't have normal legs, but the normal legs don't looks like a dress, and this improvise is cool. Another things in the set are the fireplace, well builted and made, have also orange pieces to like fire, and the crystal ball, simple, but so cool. The witch have also a hat, large and cool, to witches or wizards. This in overall is a small set from the fright knights of the classic castle, includes useful pieces, or pieces for make a lego environment, like the bat. I rate this set 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"borg72","2009-02-21T07:52:10.31Z","Small but perfectly formed","for such a tiny, tiny set, there are five great parts that make this set worthwhile:

A witch minifig, complete with printed-brick skirt and hat
A red translucent wand
A kitty (!)
A bat
A crystal ball (on a barrel)

any one of these might be enough to make this a must-have.

add in the rarity factor, its a definate small investment!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"blue9966","2010-03-06T12:03:31.7Z","The Wicked Witch of the West!","<p>This set is yery good in my opinion. The fireplace is nicely built and the chrystal ball is a cool piece. I like the black cat and the rare Witch parts. Another thing is that you can build this with parts you have at home.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-09T10:16:23.44Z","LEGO Castle (Fright Knights) - Witch and Fireplace Review","This set is the cheapest set which comes with the black LEGO Castle (Fright Knights) witch minifig. She has a black hat, a black dress with some nce markings and a very evil look on her face. She also has a wand which is a cool piece to get. This impulse set includes a black cat, a brown keg with a crystal ball on the top and the fireplace with a translucent green cylinder piece on the top. This set doesn't have any play features but it's a good addition to a LEGO castle for sure. This set is an easy built and very sturdy. We also don't get any stickers in this model. This set is good for an impulse set but I still think you should try to get the bigger models first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
