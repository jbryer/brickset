I like how you can use the can as a statue or something like that. I remember having non-stop fun.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-12T10:30:09Z","Simply Superb!","       This set is an instant goody in my sight!  The plane is the true World War 1 style and the propeller is perfect for the era too. The bi-plane is clearly the best part, haveing a super stylish front with the shark emblem and some machine guns eleswhere! The pilot minifig is also super, it has the G1 bomber jacket and some WW1 leather neck and goggles! The maps of this theme also are impressive! You also gotta love that car, with the visible pistons and cylinders, it is true 1920s. Possibly the most classic bad guys behind Darth Vader, Lord Sinister's ID wasnt exposed in those days! You also get Doctor Kilroy and the Baron! The mummy coffin and little utensils are also allstar! This is a greato set!

The car was also nice because it featured acool looking engine. The airplane has a sharks face which is also a great feature.
If anyone finds this set anywhere, they should definitely buy it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
