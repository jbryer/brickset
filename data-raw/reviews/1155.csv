The front of the car looks pretty good until the flaws are noticed. There is no minifig and there should be a piece to cover up the back of the car. This set is really bad and is a set not to buy.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-06-24T21:22:01.2Z","Not that bad","This set came with a whole container of cookies. The jeep is more like a convertable and it can easily be modified to be made a jeep using larger windshield pieces and a roof. There is also room to add a small dashboard. A pro of leaving the set the way it is that it will fit very easily through car washes, and it barely takes up any space on the road.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Tons of people have them around here to go off roading. They&#39;re pretty popular among ranchers and cowboys because of their versatility, and the openness of a Jeep isn&#39;t a big deal when you live somewhere where it&#39;s blazing hot 90 percent of the year (the time I&#39;m writing this review being the other ten percent). So I feel like I know what I&#39;m talking about when I say: This looks absolutely nothing like a Jeep, open-top or otherwise. This thing looks more like a pickup truck, maybe? But not like any pickup I&#39;ve ever seen...</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>Considering this set is nothing <em>but</em> a model, this is about all the review will be. All I can say is it looks... Pretty good, actually. Nothing like the prototype, at all, but taken on its own terms? It&#39;s a pretty attractive looking, if extremely unrealistic, city vehicle. Every kid with a Lego town probably has fifteen fire trucks and thirty cop cars, but civilian vehicles are sadly few and far between, so getting one of these to bolster your townspeople&#39;s numbers is a great idea. It sort of resembles a really small, really flat pickup truck. As I&#39;ve railed on in previous reviews, TLC was run by a designer that had a car roof squash his whole family as a child and thus had a deep seated phobia of car roofs, and this car is no exception: It has no roof at all. That said, the &quot;Open Top&quot; in the item&#39;s title sort of excuses that, except that pickup trucks virtually never are sans-roof, but that&#39;s okay. It&#39;s 1997-1998 Lego, what are you going to do.</p>

<p>Normally I ramble on about how you can MOC-modify the set to make it more realistic but with this... You really can&#39;t. It&#39;s simply too flat. Adding a roof and a minifig scaled windshield makes it look all sorts of wonky so you&#39;re pretty much stuck with what you have. As if knowing that it scales poorly with minifigs ahead of time, TLC went ahead and decided not to actually put a minifig in with the set for some reason. This is one of seriously maybe three sets I have to have no people included with it whatsoever. No idea why they did this; there have been cheaper sets with more parts that managed to include at least one figure, but alas, this &quot;Jeep&quot;-like object lacks a driver and it&#39;s up to you to include your own. Oh, well.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Surprisingly good. It&#39;s made up of a bunch of plates that all are re-enforced well and interlock properly and make it look like an actually pretty attractive vehicle. No complaints here. It isn&#39;t the second coming of Lego Building Jesus, but it&#39;s 1997, nothing that came out that year was. No real design flaws to speak of except that it doesn&#39;t look like anything known to man.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>This is the easiest category to impress me on, and this set does not impress me on it even slightly. Very, very poor. You probably already have all the parts needed to make this set laying around in your spare parts drawer already. There isn&#39;t anything in this set that&#39;s even vaguely rare, interesting, exclusive, etc. It&#39;s just a bunch of plates.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Well, it&#39;s a vehicle with no driver. 1/5, what did you expect. Add a driver and it goes up. MOC-modify the thing and it goes up. Put it in a traffic scene and it goes up. But I try to review sets on their own merits in a vaccuum and judging that way this is a pretty sad excuse for a set. If you have a thriving Lego town that needs another vehicle in it though, you could do way, way worse <em>*cough fire chief&#39;s car cough*</em> than this thing. But if you&#39;re getting a set to play with as virtually everyone in Lego&#39;s target audience is, there&#39;s quite literally nothing for you here. For some reason.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>For such a weird, bad set, the value&#39;s surprisingly high. Why, you ask? Because this thing is seriously, next-level cheap. They must&#39;ve rolled out a billion of these things because twenty years after release they&#39;re still one to three dollars on bricklink. They&#39;re mostly only available for import for some reason, and trust me, you don&#39;t want to order from overseas and pay customs and shipping just for this one set.</p>

<p>For once I really don&#39;t know who to recommend this to. I guess if you absolutely have to have every vehicle TLC ever made, this is one of them. It&#39;s really cheap, but it&#39;s also pretty useless, so there&#39;s that.</p>
