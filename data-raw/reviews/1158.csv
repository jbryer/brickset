"Novelty","2007-04-22T00:11:19.6Z","Sink or Swim","This is a small little fan driven boat.  The good is that it's small.  The bad?  1. Horrible colour scheme, red and yellow with black highlights doesn't make it interesting.  2. Horrible looks - this doesn't even look like a fan propelled boat.  3.No minifig.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-03T12:06:08.19Z","Red/ Yellow Sunset","This model is another confusing one. It appears to be the next model in the basic, town series that had no mini-fig after the 1991 releases. Even more confusing not a series of models but an individual. Why six years later? Why not put in a mini-fig? Why only one? Please correct me if im wrong as I am going by memory at the moment. It may have something to do with the whole promo release thing but still.

The model itself is a boat. A fan propelled boat. The yellow of the boat really makes it stick out against the water, which works nicely with the black but I feel the red was a little too much. Speaking of the red, in my instructions the front picture is red but in stages 6 + 7 where the steering wheel goes on it becomes yellow, not red. Slightly confusing but if you look closely at the top of the steering wheel there is a line of red so im sure you can see my point. Anyone else care to confirm, or is it just my dodgy instructions. 

Overall its a nice little boat but very plain and simple. Not really in the same league as the 1990/91 releases. A 5/10 or Average from me. A nice addition to a town or beach collector or if you like to race this one is number 3 or just a good one to have as a spare for when another boat breaks down. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
