"Blade","2007-09-05T13:08:55.27Z","Microlight is Right","This model brings a whole new meaning to the term light aircraft. Consisting of a whole 14 pieces plus mini-fig you can see why. Not that I dislike this set.

It's a small model aeroplane consisting of two big triangular wings and a tail fin. Having no controls and only one set of wheels for the front you understand the whole bare basics thing. The mini-fig is dressed in all red with a black helmet and stock standard face.

If you play with you model you soon realise that this model only needs what it has as it ends up being someone's private aeroplane anyway. Also it was meant to be a promotional item or a free bee so you cant really complain. If it were shop bought, any more than $2 AU then you should complain.

Overall its still a good model for what it is and gets the job done so it scrapes a 5/10 from me. If you like to play with plane this one is for you and if you collect this one is too being promotional and all.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-08T11:21:08.657Z","LEGO Town (Flight) - Microlight Review","This set was an impulse set of the old LEGO Town theme but I have to admit that this set isn't one of my favourite models I got. The built is simple - too simple. Also the minifig which comes with this set isn't my favourite figure. The pilot just has a red overall and red pants - with no markings. The face is a basic smiley face. The little plane doesn't have any play features and any controls. If you're interested in getting this small set for pieces and the minifig which you could use for brickfilms and MOC's for example I would recommend you to pick this set up.<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
