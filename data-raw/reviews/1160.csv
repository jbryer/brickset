"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-09T13:30:38.917Z","LEGO Town (Shops and Services) - Ice Cream Seller Review","This is one of the best impulse sets of the LEGO Town theme I've built. The stand is built really quick and it's very sturdy. We get a female minifig who has black hair, white pants and a pink shirt with white arms. This lady is supposed to be the ice cream seller.<br><br>The stand comes with a freezer which you can open. In there are two 1x1 plates without studs which are supposed to be the package of the ice cream. The other part which we get is the cash register. It has a printed computer and two translucent cones which I think are supposed to be bottles or the ice cream which the customer bought. There're also two drawers where you can store the money which is included in this set. I think it's a nice little impulse set but I wish it should have come with a customer who is buying the ice cream.<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Nice little figure to be the cashier!</li>
	<li>There&#39;s a nice cooler for the ice cream which it can easily fit in it.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Nice amount of printed pieces for such a small and cheap set!</li>
	<li>Can fit almost everywhere in a Lego town! (Not in the middle of the sea)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>No cons, really. It&#39;s just a really small build so of course there wouldn&#39;t be too much to it and wouldn&#39;t serve too much playability. Kids get bored after using the same little thing for too long!</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice little set with not too much with it. It&#39;ll look good in the background with people around the stall trying to get ice cream! 7/10</p>
