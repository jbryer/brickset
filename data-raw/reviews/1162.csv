We get one minifig who's the owner of the gas station. He comes with a white cap, black shades and a blue overall.<br><br>The gas station is built very fast. I don't think you'll need longer than 5 minutes to put this stuff together. This model doesn't have any play features but we get some pieces which you can use for MOC's and brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

This is another of the many &quot;where did this even come from?&quot; sets that I stored in a baggie in my attic for the better part of 20 years. Must&#39;ve liked this one, too, or at least thought it looked nice, because it was totally intact.</p>

<p>What to say about this thing? Not a lot, really. It&#39;s probably the best looking gas pump 1997 Lego could&#39;ve made in 15 bricks, but that&#39;s a pretty low bar. I&#39;m going to give this thing a three mostly because while it isn&#39;t bad by any means, it&#39;s also not really all the good and not particularly interesting or playable.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>This thing&#39;s biggest strength is the fact that it does actually resemble what it&#39;s supposed to insomuch as anything can in Lego form with this few pieces. It&#39;s not hard to imagine this thing being a gas pump. The (shockingly rare) cash register slope brick actually looks like a convincing pump mechanism, the little rope brick looks like a gas hose, and the guy that comes with it I suppose could be a gas pump attendant, had I ever seen such a thing in my life (not a lot of gas pump attendants in western Texas).</p>

<p>So is it bad? Well, no, not at all. It&#39;s pretty good actually. It scales nicely with a good 80 percent of the 1996-2000 era Lego vehicles that I have (except some of the real clunkers like the 4WD police patrol set) and you can put the nozzle brick on a stud on the back of a car and mimic filling it up with gas, which is really cool. The problem is just that the two gas station sets made at the time already came with something like this. #6548 has its own gas pump that came with it that is honestly the best part of the whole set. The Shell promotional sets, one of them was just a gas pump that this thing doesn&#39;t hold a candle to.</p>

<p>What I will say this is useful for is if you have the 6434 set &quot;Roadside Repair&quot;. That one inexplicably didn&#39;t include a pump with it so this makes a nice addition to that dictionary-definition-of-mediocre set. Other than that one (that came out two years later) if you had a gas station set from 1997-ish you already have this and better.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Slim to none, but it&#39;s a 15 piece impulse buy set, what do you want? This is &#39;97, nothing was a good experience to build in the Town lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Not great. Do note, I try to grade sets on a bit of a curve. A set with 300 pieces should have a good proportion of those parts be interesting/unique/worth buying in order to get a high mark, for instance. A set of ten pieces I tend to go easier on because one piece can make all the difference.</p>

<p>That said... There are 15 pieces and only one of them is even remotely rare and even that one isn&#39;t all that rare nor all that great. The rest of them are bog-standard bricks... Good to have, certainly, but nothing to write home about minus the single sloped printed brick. The string gas hose is a neat piece but all sorts of sets have them and they don&#39;t maybe withstand the test of time what I would call <em>great</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>You can use this thing to add onto an existing gas station, which you basically have to, as this set is like one fourth of all the stuff a gas station should have, so you need a bigger set for this to not look incredibly out of place. That said, if you do have a bigger set, this is very playable and is a great detail to making your town&#39;s gas station look even bigger. On its own it&#39;s not much at all, but paired up it&#39;s fine. Its displayability is good and you can make a good amount of poses... Just not on its own, it virtually requires another set to show its full potential.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>Not great. Nowadays it goes for five-six dollars on bricklink and it basically has to be imported with all the extra shipping, wait times, and risk of customs eating your package alive that comes with it. It&#39;s not really worth four or five dollars just because there&#39;s almost nothing here. If you&#39;re ordering a bigger, better set and the seller has this in stock, I suppose you could do worse if you&#39;re made of money, but if you&#39;re Town-ing on a budget this really is a pretty pointless set. You can probably build the little thing with spare parts you have on hand already anyways.</p>
