Same set as 1917, the &quot;Stone Bomber&quot; was released in 1998 and was packaged with Kabaya sweets, so, it is a promo set, and includes few pieces. The minifigure included is a black knight, simple designed but nice, because it still in a simple lego minifigure style, and have a cool color scheme, with some red, yellow and black details, also includes a helmet and a sword. The catapult is so simple, builted above a green small plate, and made with some black and gray blocks on each side, increased with two axes, and these have in the center a long plate, the part of the catapult that launchs the stones, small blocks in circular shapes. The catapult, altough basic, works well, but with a simple playability. This set is a small promotional set, good in comparison with the size, one more small to increase more castle sets. This must have a comparison with other promotional sets with the same size, so, it is a 5/5.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
