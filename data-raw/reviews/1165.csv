"Novelty","2007-07-16T06:23:43.653Z","Flim Flam alakazam!","The contents of this set: a wizard, his glow in the dark wand, a grey parrot, a treasure chest, 2 wheels and some assorted pieces that makes the cart. This set is great if one is looking for an army of wizards, or a large collection of wands, grey parrots or treasure chest, because it is so small it is economically to purchase quite a large quantity of it. On its own there isn't really any redeption - why would a wizard want to hand carry a cart when he could presumably fly or teleport?",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

This is a good set, an addition from the classic castle. More simple, but more cool than the new included on new castle. The newers are more silly, have printings on hat, and things for only childrens that likes lego. This, i think, that everyone that likes lego will like. This don't have a storyline, but the owner of the toy have to create this. Another thing is the cart, made with useful pieces, still good in any sets, and is the owner that decides if the wizard carries one or not. Features of the set are the cart, the hat,a gray parrot, beard and cool colors of the complete set. His staff glows in the dark. This is a little set, if you wants a little set of classic castle, wizards or of the dragon knights' theme, this is one great choice, 5/5.
