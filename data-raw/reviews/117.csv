This is an odd ordeal being this is a Christmas set, and I celebrate Christmas.  However, I decided to use the term happy holidays because I and writing this review closer to New Year's than Christmas.
 I did not actually buy this set, but one day during advent, was looking for something to do and decided to get into the Christmas sprit by... building Christmas Legos!  Anyway, onto the meat and potatoes of this review!  
 This is a great set: easy enough to build (like mentioned earlier, I simply built mine by looking at a picture of it in an old catalogue), and still looks great when you've finished building it.  One complaint I have is that if you actually buy the set, is that it's too limited.  Sure it makes a great elf sitting on a present, but what if you want to make two different colored elves on presents?  What if you want to make an elf girl sitting on a present?  Then, youâ€™re out of luck, and have to buy ether more bricks, or a different set.  Also, isn't, $3.00 (usd) a little much for seemingly, 10 pieces that build an elf?
 Overall though, I'll give this little elfin guy, and his gift 10/10.  Perhaps it's just the Christmas sprit in me, but I say it's because when you look at him, you just have to smile.
