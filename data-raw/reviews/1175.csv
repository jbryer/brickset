It was very swooshable and I&nbsp;remember enjoying the transformations, and the lights and sounds were a blast!! &nbsp;Very creative idea with different pieces creating different sounds and images on the screen. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would definitely&nbsp;recommend this set, the most unique Duplo set I&#39;ve ever encountered! :)</p>
