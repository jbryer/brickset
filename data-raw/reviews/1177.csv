<p>You can tell Lego was experimenting&nbsp;with something new. In this series, you had modular pieces, mostly joints that connected with each other, and you tightened the built-in&nbsp;hinges with a &quot;screwdriver&quot; that came with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was sometimes a bit confusing to put together. Here you got some sort of backhoe/dump truck combination. It was fun to play with, even with non-lego toys, since it is not very &quot;Lego&quot; integrated to begin with, which might have been a problem since it didn&#39;t really match the other lego&nbsp;or even duplo products.</p>

<p>Also I remember that disassembling it was a pain has it was rather large and if you wanted to put it away you would have to loosen the bolts again.</p>

<p>At least putting it back together was fun.</p>
