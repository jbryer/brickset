It disgusts me that you can say that this isn't LEGO when even LEGO themselves have said that Bionicle brings in alot of Money. Also, Bionicle has led to one of the 'nets biggest forums (BZPower), which is bigger than any LEGO site I've seen.

Review:
This set is amazing. But Typically I opened one of the sides than the back so it was harder to build. I don't reccomend building this in a car when you've opened the box wrong. 

Pros:
New mask which is LE!
Good way to build a collection
2 very good sets

Cons:
They almost literally shoved the bags, instructions and pieces into this box, but neatly. You have to open each bag to see what set it belongs to. And then this isn't made easy for you as there is about 5/6 bags to open. There is no markings on the bag except set number to tell you which set it goes with, which is annoying.

Overall, I rate this set 9 as it combines 2003s greatest 2 Bionicle sets into one lovely box with a cool LE Mask.
