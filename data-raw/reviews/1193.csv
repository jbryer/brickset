<h4>Parts</h4>The whole point of this set is the Duplo motor base unit and remote control. To my knowledge, this is the only set to contain these items. The remote control has 4 channel settings - 1,2,3 and a fourth combined setting, i.e.1/2/3 together. This means you can have up to three Duplo remotes vehicles under your control,&nbsp;independently or simultaneously.<div><br><div>The base unit has a slider for the channel, and a small green button on the underside. After a period of inactivity, the base turns itself off, and you need to press the green button to turn it on again. &nbsp;This is a really good thing. I have one of those el-cheapo Chinese RC cars, and the batteries get drained in no time if the kids forget to slide the&nbsp;power to off at the end of a play session.</div><div><br></div><div>You'll need 6 x AA batteries, 3 for each unit.</div><div><br></div><div>Otherwise, there's a rather manic looking driver figure, a nifty oversized chrome silver digger bucket, a Duplo Toolo screwdriver and a collection of Duplo Toolo bricks. You also get a choice of wheels with tires, or bulldozer tracks.<br>
<h4><br></h4>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is a winged digger truck. But it's not really about that. What matters is you get a remote control car base with plenty of room to build on. There's a 4 x 6 area, and a recessed 2 x 4 area at the front, as well as side mounting holes for Toolo bricks. That's about as adaptable as it gets for Duplo. Remember, regular Lego 2 x 4, 2 x 6 and 2 x 8 bricks can fit on top of a Duplo base too, so you can also use this with your ordinary sets. Only one complaint - &nbsp;I wish it had hooks to attach to Duplo train bases though.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The Remote Control base works as it should. Good strong power to the two driving wheels,&nbsp;independently&nbsp;controlled by two rocker switches. So if you want to build RC Duplo vehicles and robots, this most definitely is the set for you. You'll need to go to eBay or BrickLink to pick one up, but it's well worth seeking one out.</p><p><br></p></div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
