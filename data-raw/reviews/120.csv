"Legowarroir","2007-12-30T11:20:55.967Z","Okay.","I got this set for christmas 3 years ago. But there are some failures. It is very unstable and hard to pose and it does'nt show instructions for one of the wings.

                         Pros

                         It is about1 1/2 feet tall.

                         Cons

If not, you had better start, since this is among the top 10 greatest LEGO deals I have ever found.

This set was alright, and for the price, nobody could resist.
I have yet to build Ultimate Dume (Doom, Dume who cares, he's evil), probably lack of interest and its ovious lack of strucural integrity. The three sets were actually pretty sound, I usually take my time with larger bionicle sets, since the usualy work better if you are precise about it. Of the sets, my original favorite was Krekka, but now I sort of like Nidhiki better. 
Krekka is big and fearce (but very dumb...) and is heavily armed with the mounted disk launcher (which if done wrong will cause the handle's gear to slide out of position), some staff weopon, and the scissor like weopon that looks like a pair of tin snips (and in a world of robots and metal, thats bad). He is very mechanical looking and fairly built, but the feet sometimes fall of.
Nidhiki is large, spiderlike, has BIG claws that work for once, and a disk laucher/picer mouth. He built very well and by far the best of the bunch. Whats cool is if done right you cam fold him up really tigh and he stores easily, unlike most other sets where the bionicles had to be partially disassembled.
Lastly Turaga Dume and his pet bird thing Nivawk.
Turaga Dume is small, ut follows the design for the other matoran at the time (if he is a turaga, he should have been built like the originals, but then he wouldn't fit in the cool harness). The mask he has is nicely mixed with red and black. The bird, Nivawk, however, is less stable at the legs, but the wings and harness as well as the talons are really cool. I like how the cables cause the wings to change position when pulled or squeezed, especiall how it makes the &quot;feathers&quot; spread. The harness is alright, since it fits Dume and holds tight due to the cable's natural tendancy to flex back to its original shape.

All in all a great bargain if you don't pay extra for shipping (plus it is smaller than buying three boxes.) and it comes with the mask and the parts to attach it (a rare item, since it is only found in this set!) ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-10-30T19:56:44.043Z","My favorite Bionicle!","This GIGANTIC set arrived in the mail a few years ago, and it still displayed on my shelf, though it can barely fit. It is a truly great set, though it is not perfect. I will list the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Tallest Bionicle set to date
-Fierce looking
-Comes with limited edition mask
-Is a combination of 3 cool set, so you can build those if you tire of this one
-Rather cheap
-Very flexible
-Wings are awesome
-Claws can be moved, and can even lift a Toa and hold him!

Cons:
-TOO flexible, his height added to his relative lack of weight makes him flimsy and hard to stand up. Great to play with you have big hands and hold on to him.
-Left hand isn't nearly as movable as the right, and tends to revert back to normal position, unlike the right, which will stay where you move it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
