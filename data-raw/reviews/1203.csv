I find the Beachguard a great idea (and nicely done), but&nbsp;I find the vehicle a bit boring (and strange to include in this beach set). it would have made more sense in my opinion if this set had the Jetski set from this series&nbsp;instead of this car that does not seem to have any (special) capabilities.</p>
