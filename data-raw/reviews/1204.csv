Lot of detail in this model and the driver looks cool. Car does roll well on carpet due to the oversized wheels. Good solid set - fun to play around with.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Brock_the_Builder","2008-05-04T00:04:06.843Z","Sweet Little Buggy","I just put this set together today.  It was quick and easy, but the car has some cool features.  The spoiler is infinitely adjustable.  The antenna tilts.  The driver is super cool.  The chrome exhaust pipes are also a nice touch.  Lastly, the wheels roll smoothly and are a perfect size.  This car is so cool, it could go with Town or Space theme.  I give it a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-11-19T16:18:49.5Z","Very well thought out","I have an amazing amount of Lego sets that are cars, even though I don't love cars all that much...weird. Anyway, this is a really great one. It looks very cool, and drives even better. The translucent green brick goes up so the driver can get out, and the back bends up and down to. It's not a HUGE car, but it sure is a good one!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-02-02T10:14:26.023Z","LEGO Town (Extreme Team) - Extreme Team Racer Review","This is a fun set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very nice and easy and we also a sticker to put on. The windscreen opens very easily and the minifig can fit in very well as well. The antenna and the rear wing can sviwel, too. This set has some cool looking pieces like the chrome exhaust pipe on each side. I also like the design which LEGO has chosen for this model. As I told you in the beginning: It's a fun set to have - even for pieces
 which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms
 for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
