"Gus_263","2008-05-05T13:43:35.17Z","Addition to the insectoids","This set was released in 1998, is another small set of the space subtheme and insectoids subtheme. Not so much small like other insectoids sets (6903 and 6817 are smaller than this, it have a medium size), this includes some useful pieces, and also more building involved.

Some pieces features the translucent green color scheme, and these were common with some space sets of the 1990's years. This set includes two minifigures, well detailed, more looks like aliens, but these have the original Lego minifigure shape. The &quot;black&quot; (not completely black, with more details) minifigure have a transparent helm and the other minifigure is increased by an &quot;armor&quot; (it cover the chest, without interfere in the movements of the arms, this armor was common with the minifigures of the UFO subtheme), and a translucent green helmet, common among the minifigures of the insectoids subtheme. Overall, the minifigures are useful, well designed and have the original Lego minifigure shape, altough are aliens.

The building involved, present in the spaceship, is well made, but it isn't very well completed, because it was made to looks like an insect, so, it isn't so much complete like the flying saucers from the UFO subtheme, but have a cool design, and the color schemes makes it better. Using two connected plates with different plates as base, this set don't dismantle when you play with it, because the pieces above fit well. On the center, there are bricks making divisions to the two cockpits, place for the two pilots. Eaxh cockpit is different, but these are small, altough the minifigures fit well. On the front, one of the cockpits is increased by some black, blue and translucent green bricks, making it looks like an insect, but it still much simple. On the back, tghe other cockpit is also simple, but the minifigure still fitted well there, and it is too increased by some bricks, like the small triangular black shape. The minifigure can &quot;reach the controls of the spaceship&quot;, that are made by printed details on a gray brick. Above the controls there is a plate, increased by a piece with the shape like a pincer, useful because it makes this spaceship looks like more an insect, like all the other spaceships of this subtheme.

Among the cockpits, there are more bricks increasing it, some like the translucent blue wings (these have some printed details), two black turbines and four &quot;insect paws&quot;, gray encurved bricks well designed, common in this subtheme. The set also is increased by some more itens, like a black gun for the pilot and a translucent crystal with a metallic sticker on the top, useful to this subtheme, and too common among this, because some other insectoid spaceships includes one or more magnets, making a magnetic effect, turning easy to hang the crystals with the spaceship.

This set features too a good playability, altough is simple, and in comparison with some other sets in the same size, it gets a 4.7 of 5, because it could be more increased, is too simple altough is better than some new alien spaceships. The building is good and the design nice. Now it is a rarity, so it isn't cheap like it was, but if you find it by a price like 15 dollars, it will be a good chance to get some space stuff from the 1990's years. Overall, the set is good and shows some aspects of the insectoid subtheme. An addition to any Lego space fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set includes a droid and an insectoid, which is rare. The wings on this set are pure genius and the design looks way futuristic and the minifigs rock once again.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
