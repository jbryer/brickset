It exceeds many other highly prized sets by far in my opinion. Lego had there ducks in a row when they did the &quot;My Own Train&quot; theme and then marketed add-on light function&nbsp;and separate sealed bag&nbsp;brick sets&nbsp;specially designed for the locomotives and tenders in a wide variety of colours. Just amazingly fun to build but nothing close to getting two of these guys set up in tandem and pulling some loaded wagons!!! Cheers&nbsp;</p>
