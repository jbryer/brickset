This set contains the unique Winnie the Pooh and Eeyore donkey character. Also the cake and present box are nice parts. The yellow table can be used in combination with other stories and the Winnie the Pooh sign can also be used as a railway station sign.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

But I was very disappointed that they didn't include the useful pot to put things in that Pooh actually brought Eeyore in the Winnie the Pooh books.  

Colors are also very nice, but you truly need other Winnie the Pooh sets to build up a realistic world to play with these pieces in.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
