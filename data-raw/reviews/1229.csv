The use of the guns and dynamite are good supplies in this set. The car isn't that great and could have been better. The mummy and Slyboots are a great addition to this set. A great set to own for Adventurers fans.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The design of the tomb is neet.I am a big fan of the adventurers theme. I like that it comes with snakes and a mummy. But a tomb that leads to nowhere, pointless.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I mention in my review for <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/reviews/?ID=38862"">2995</a>, the Adventurers' Desert&nbsp;subtheme looks like it'll go well with Pharaoh's Quest, so I've been putting these back together. This one was completed in about five minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hotep is one&nbsp;awesome minifig, still the best monster based minifigure ever&nbsp;IMO, no wolfman or vampire or other mummy is going to dethrone him. The colors just match, and the face is wicked as heck. Sam Sinister is pretty much all over the place in Desert Adventure sets, so chances are fans of the theme already have him. Not bad, not amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hotep's casket is a great piece. This blue+black casket&nbsp;only appears in&nbsp;this set (however the black top and blue&nbsp;bottom both appear in two sets), so you should consider yourself lucky if you have one of these. If you are a true Lego monster collector, you need this. The two front&nbsp;tomb pillars are printed as is the 1X4 tile. Great pieces to have for your Egyptian MOC. Some pillars, gates,&nbsp;accessories&nbsp;,and common pieces round out the inventory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Sinister's car is a pathetic excuse for a Lego vehicle. I was building better cars using the exact same basic car plate when I was 8. Absolute filler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tomb is nothing exciting either, as the design is flawed. The door opens up to nothing. You can't even put the casket behind the door, either horizontally or vertically without blocking it, and who in their right mind would put it right behind the door anyways?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not much, with a casket you can have some fun but the tomb itself sucks too much to provide any background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is tricky. The original price is&nbsp;definitely four bricks&nbsp;considering the rare things you get. Nowadays, however, I've seen Hotep+Blue/Black Casket going for USD$20 in my local market, and Hotep alone&nbsp;for&nbsp;around $9 on a certain website. Needless to say, being a limited release has also pushed its price sky high. Is this set worth the $40 up you usually see it for? No. Are the printed elements/minifigures/casket worth getting? Yes. So the answer should be clear. Get the figs/parts loose. Don't go paying for the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've said pretty much all I need to say about this set. I would have much rather they took out the filler car and tomb and given us some more minifigs and accessories. Good thing the battlepack concept has caught on outside of Castle nowadays.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,5,1,2,4
"Cake_Crafted","2016-05-14T15:13:52.64Z","Nice set but nothing special ","<p>Yep, I&#39;m reviewing another Adventurers set. I don&#39;t know why but I&#39;m&nbsp;really into this theme right now. Anyway on the the review.</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll start off with the minifigures as usual. This set comes with two. Sam Sinister/Slyboots. l&#39;m really not sure what his name is but I usually call him Sam. You also get Pharaoh Hotep with his ruby.</p>

<p>There are a few accessories that come with the set, a rifle, spade, pickaxe and a mug, with a box to keep them in as well as a snake, scorpion and sarcophagus.</p>

<p>The car has got to be the one of the smallest Lego cars I have ever seen, although it does look kind of cute.</p>

<p>The tomb itself is also pretty small. It has some nice printed pieces but apart from that there isn&#39;t really much to say about it. It&#39;s so small you can&#39;t even fight the sarcophagus inside. It looks reasonably good but there isn&#39;t much you can do with it.</p>

<p>So this is a nice set but nothing special. I think it would be better if they had removed the car and made the tomb larger. In my opinion it is not worth the price that it sells for, being a limited edition set. However I was able to build it using my own sets and random piece&#39;s on Rebrickable, so I would recommend&nbsp;trying that.</p>
