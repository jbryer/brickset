It wasn't that often Lego would bring out a set related to a specific country, or even postal service vocation. This item fills the two voids, there by expanding your Legoland Town collection.

The van is very typical in build, spanning 4 studs wide and 14 studs long.
One mini-figure can only fit inside the diver's seat.
A hatch on the top allows for placement/deplacemnt of the mini-figure.
The van is equiped with two passanger doors and window-shutter styled doors at the rear.
The cargo area within the van is only 2 studs wide and spans about 7 studs deep.
The set does not contain any unusual pieces, and can easly be constructed just by looking at the box/cover.
The only unique pieces in the set are the 1x6 white bricks cotaining single sided markings of the Canadian Post and Maple Leaf.

With wear and tear, the shutters at the rear can snap its henges.
Plus the unique markings on the sides of the van can wear off.

Unfortuantly for most, this is the type of purchase you could only make at the right place, at the right time.
I just happen to be traveling through Canada in the 80's when I stumbled upon it. Lucky me!

How lucky were you?
