I love the orange saw and the control panel is good to add to your collection. You can probably build it just looking at the picture! The black engines are a nice touch. The hinge brick (The one that holds the control panel)is good to have! There so hard to find! I can't figure out what the black megaphone is for. Is it a gun? Hmmmm.... I never thought that such a little set could get such a long review!
