It wasn't expensive and it has rockets on the sides of the ship.  It has a rare minifigure with a really cool shirt, pants and a cool looking helmet.  It looks like a hovercraft as the other reviewer has said.  I hope you enjoyed my review and I hope it helped to make you decide whether or not to get this set!

It's easy to build as well. I have got to rebuild this sometime. &nbsp;The old Space Police sets are very&nbsp;underrated. If you can find one on Ebay, it may be worth getting. I'll gather up my pieces and rebuild this&nbsp;eventually...",FALSE,3,3,1,4,3
