For a small set, it is great, i think that it deserves a rate 5/5, because it is also a catapult that launchs two pieces. The pieces and colors are all combinated with the figure and so compatible. The minifigure is a soldier with red details of the theme, easy to find when released, hard for now. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
