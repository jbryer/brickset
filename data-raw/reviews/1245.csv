Released with Kabaya sweets in Japan as a promotional small set, The &quot;Ninpo water spider&quot; is good to increase more creations of the ninja or some other Lego sets from different themes, altough this set is small, it still good, and features some useful pieces. The simple and nice ninja minifigure is well made and one of the coolest Lego minifigures, it can carry a katana on the back of the cap, and is basically covered by a black scheme and some white details. The building involved in the small raft is basic, made by some bricks, like the brown with some differences from others in the textures, and two spears on each side, increasing it. The building also have on the base, some red little plates with different shapes, and above, there is a brick with circular shape, increased by another brick, with the correct shape to fit some pieces like the longbow, included in the set. Altough small, this was a cheap (and in some places, with the Kabaya japanese sweets, it was free) option to get some useful pieces and a characteristic small set of the ninja theme. In comparison with other promotional and small sets, this still nice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
