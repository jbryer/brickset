"Gus_263","2008-03-27T16:06:35.373Z","Another Samurai minifigure","The same set was released, in another name, and  i reviewed it. I put the review again to keep a good rate to it. The &quot;LEGO Shogun Go!&quot; set have a samurai minifigure, with blue armors, and the cart is too different, don't have the function of a catapult, like the set named cart, but have two katanas and a brown piece that can be used as a window of a prision or a part of a stair. Another useful things are the wheels, included in some themes, if with some other carts, is easy to make a bigger vehicle. The helmet of the minifigure is also different in comparision with the included in the other ninja cart. This is small, but too usable to creations, it is great if in a low price. The size is due to it was packaged with sweets, in japan, for sweets, the sets were smaller.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You get a fully armoured Shogun with a chrome headpiece and two katanas and an admittedly odd cart. However if you are a fan of the old samurai movie series called Lone wolf and cub it is not too hard to imagine this as the infamous battle cart/stroller. The cart has a wooden hatch which can be opened to reveal whatever sinister (and very very small) cargo the Shogun is carrying. The best thing about this set is that you get a spare gold chrome headpiece. Wonderful!",FALSE,5,5,2,4,4
