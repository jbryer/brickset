You do get two spears with the set, the wings are OK, and the wall parts are hard to come by but the set completed does look a little dorky. I got it because it was cheap and it had a Ninja.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It was released with the &quot;glider&quot; name, but this, the same, was packaged with sweets, due to it, is a small set. The glider is made with pieces of the western wall with the brown color, black wings and other small pieces like little blue plates, have also spears on it's back. The ninja have gray details, and this can be finded easy on another ninja sets. The building is easy, and it likes to the raft to the same theme, but have another forms to build it and is easy to mix it, many children can do that. This is a classic because includes a ninja minifigure, now, hard to find. Many ninja sets had ninjas with equipments to fly, and this isn't different, but is bigger because was released as only one set, not one included on another set. If it have classic or useful things this deserves great rate. See if is unreasonable a ninja flies with it on back isn't important.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
