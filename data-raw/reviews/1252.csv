This is a small vehicle with a minifigure, the set isn't an army builder and don't have buildings. The vehicle is different in comparision with the castle carts, pirate rafts or soldiers and horses from western, this is a car, with few pieces, isn't easy build a car with few pieces, is more easy a cart or other things. Because it, this is a useful set, but cars can't be very completed with these pieces. The set is named &quot;Sly Boot's car&quot;, i don't know the reason, perhaps is something about the minifigure, included in the other series of the adventurers theme. Some pieces are black, and the front have a simple glass. It don't have doors, the black hat and details of the minifigure combines with the complete set. This, the minifigure, have also a weapon. Is cool for a small set, it was packaged with sweets on japan, turning the set more rare.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
