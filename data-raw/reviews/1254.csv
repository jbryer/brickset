Bucket - Very nice. A cool sparkling silver. 10/10

Building/Playability - Only as far as your imagination will take you. 10/10

Price - Variable ?/10

PROS:
-Silver Brick

CONS:
-None

This is one of those sets where nothing is bad, and nothing is amazing. Getting it is all up to you. Don't hunt it down because there is nothing in here (besides the silver brick) that you can't get from the lego company right now. Am I glad I got it? Yes, because I have more bricks to build with.

10/10 In conclusion, nothing really special, nothing really bad.
