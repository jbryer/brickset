I had my fun days with it already, don't mind parting with it, could use the extra cash :( not sure if I have all the parts but I have got the majority, will check the parts individually but that would take me a bit o time. Great set though!<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"meyerc13","2010-12-29T11:44:20.92Z","Good starter set","<p><span>[img]http://www.bricklink.com/SL/3026-1.jpg?0[/img]</span><br></p><p>This is an older set, but I found a sealed version of the set a little over a year ago so there are still some out there floating around in people's attics and out of the way toy shops.&nbsp; If you can't find this set, you can probably finds some of its successors sold as ""Basic Bricks"" sets.&nbsp; On to the review:<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The best thing about this set is that it comes in a large silver brick box.&nbsp; The box is even larger than the 6166 Large Brick Box's box (try saying that ten times fast!).&nbsp; Very useful for storing your LEGOs.<br></li><li>This set came with a rare chrome silver brick.&nbsp; It was only part of five different sets in 1998.&nbsp; Too bad there was only one included.<br></li><li>If you are looking for basic bricks, this set has them.&nbsp; From 1x1 and 2x2 to 1x8 and 2x6.&nbsp; The set has 244 bricks in Blue, Red, White, and Yellow.&nbsp; There are only 120 Black and 104 Green  bricks.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Con</h4>
<ul><li>The first drawback to this set is that it includes nothing but basic bricks.&nbsp; No doors, windows, plates, wheels - nothing.&nbsp; If you are into any of the various LEGO themes, this set alone won't be of much use.&nbsp; However, compared to the more recent Basic Bricks sets like 5576 and 5578, at least this includes a storage tub.<br></li></ul>
<p>This was a set that deserved a real review, if you can find it in a hole-in-the-wall Toy shop or at a rummage sale, it is worth picking up for the storage tub and large number of basic bricks.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
