<p>On the box, there are suggestions of what you could build. There is a frowning boy in a stereotypical Egyptian pose, a 5 leges animal of sorts, an animal that looks like a turtle, and a house that is 9 bricks hig, 2 studs deep, and 12 studs wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part of the set is are the classic eye&#39;s printed on 2x2 bricks and the smile/ frown 2/4 printed brick. I loved using these as a kid to put faces on my creations.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a good set for the time, but it doesn&#39;t hold up today.</p>
