Includes standard bricks in basic colors including black, red, blue, yellow, white, plus green. Pieces include 1x1s, 1x2s, 1x3s, 1x4s, 1x6s, 1x8s, 2x2s, 2x3s, and 2x4s. My only complaint is that it doesn't include anything else other that bricks.  I would have rather seen doors and windows, roof slants, or some plates included rather than six different colors of bricks.  It's still a great buy and a must have for basic building.  Lego needs to make more basic sets like this!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-30T16:40:13Z","Great!","I love this set. It contains a lot of real Lego bricks. No strange colors. This set costed 699 NOK, but got it for 399 NOK(less than 60$)two years ago. I wish Lego released for of this set, because you can never have too many of these. And the fox is good for storage too!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-01-04T19:47:50.077Z","Blocks Galore","I got this set back in the re-release of 2001 on special for $30. The tub has a whopping 1200 pieces in it, including:

1x1's
1x2's
1x3's
1x4's
1x6's
1x8's
2x2's
2x3's and
2x4's

in Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, White and Black. This is excellent for building any town buildings or basic models. I particularly love all the green pieces because if your collection is anything like mine Green pieces are hard to come by. I managed to build a massive base for my mini-figs using the whole 48x48 grey base plate, obviously using some of my own pieces, but that is just my example to shows how good this set is.

The tub itself is also great for putting extra LEGO pieces, boxes, models in and taking your LEGO anywhere.

Overall this set is a great buy and if you can get one at the right price I would seriously recommend getting one to help expand your collection. I feel this set is a 7/10 for expansion, but by itself is just blocks, so each person needs to decide if this set is right for them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
