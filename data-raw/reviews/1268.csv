I must say, that as a kid I got a different one &ndash;&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/330-1/Basic-Building-Set-3"">330</a>&nbsp;from 1985, which had very similar collection of bricks. Also from the Basic series.</p>

<p><strong>General Overview</strong><br />
It would seem, that the main idea of this set is to make different houses, as most elements are related to architecture. Some details suggest, that you can also make funny characters with big eyes.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
The Lego character is a girl in a white shirt with a palm, which would remind of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Town/subtheme-Paradisa"">Paradisa</a>&nbsp;theme, started a few years earlier. She has a classic brown ponytail and black legs.</p>

<p><strong>Bricks and Opportunities</strong><br />
As stated above &ndash; the set includes details to create different houses. There is a red door and two windows, which allow to build a Summer house or a villa with a tower, somewhere near the sea, as a beach umbrella is also present in 3040.</p>

<p>There are plenty of white, blue and red bricks, including some scopes for the roof. Fences and flowers are also an ideal pick here to make a small garden on a green baseplate, but that&#39;s it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two of the smaller bricks have Eyes print on them, so making a dog, a funny character or just a friend for the lonely figurine in this set is possible.</p>

<p>Back in 1998 this was probably a nice start for a growing kid to make a transfer from large Duplo bricks to smaller one of classic Lego system. For me as passionate collector it&#39;s just another small plesantry from 1990s to further expand my classic Lego town</p>
