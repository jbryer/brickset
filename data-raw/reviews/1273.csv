"Novelty","2007-07-16T05:46:50.81Z","Make a square crater","This set is great if you wish to tile your living room floor with Lego craters.  On its own, it's nothing, but together with a few space sets, it's great for staging rockets and launching ships and provides space for &quot;spies&quot; to watch without being seen.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-11-05T21:05:31.92Z","The surface of the moon","On its own this set is pretty bland, of course. But in conjunction with other sets it greatly expands the play factor by having a surface for your ground vehicles to explore or add to the size of your other baseplate sets.  Combine them with a few landing plates for an impressive Starbase.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Nikola_Bathory","2012-02-07T08:19:02.893Z","A must-have for all fans of Space and/or Star Wars","This old set if very simple - you get 2 big baseplates with crates (in a neat box). They are a great addition to any collection of LEGO Space and I would say to Star Wars as well. This set really increases the playability of your entire collection.<br>I'm surprised that LEGO aren't making these baseplates nowadays or at least something similar to this set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-12-28T05:40:20.297Z","This Is Where It All Starts…","I’m not sure how many of these I have as a lot of my Lego is in different boxes in various places (including the attic!) but I think I have about six or eight of them.

As parts, these provide a great base for the construction of space stations, lunar bases and anything else which you can think of.   I remember building several space stations and using the Lego girders (4476) to build walkways and platforms over the craters therefore maximising space which is taken away with the crater structures.

An excellent addition to any lunar landscape!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"go4bob","2013-03-17T08:30:14.38Z","What insects?","I am not sure how i acquired this set as i didn't have this when i was a child, but do remembering really wanting it and thinking it was cool with all the other space plates.<div>So your imagination can really take this set (being space) and apply it to the whole range of space themes and sub themes etc insectoids and others.</div><div>the crystals that they are after can be placed in the creators and other places around the lunar surface with all space themes having there own little lunar surface, with a final battle when they all want the other ones area and BOOM!&nbsp;</div><div>oh no! what have I done lego pieces every where. I guess i got to build it all up again this time keep them separate, yea thats it.&nbsp;</div><div>to put it mildly great plates.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"magpie9","2013-12-31T15:42:20.827Z","So useful","Combine two of these sets and never has a square crater looked so good.<div>One of the simplest and yet best baseplates Lego ever made, they drive your imagination to far off worlds. The building area is plenty large enough for any moonbase. In conjuction with set 306/454 Two Lunar Landing Plates the options and playability skyrocket.</div><div><br></div><div>Yes a very simple and basic set but so essential for all off world excursions.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Hitokiri_2000","2022-07-09T04:32:17.01Z","No space collection is complete without some of these.","<p>This will not really be your typical review. I hope you enjoy it anyway.</p>

<p>Well, as the title says. No Space collection is complete without minimum&nbsp;one of this set.</p>

<p>I have a good portion of these plates in my own collection,&nbsp;it really helps to create a great landscape. Follow the link below to see some of my Space collection.</p>

<p>Another set it&#39;s hard to ignore when making good layouts are the Lunar landing plates. Combine those with this set, and you are well on your way to have a great layout, of course the more you have of each of these two sets the better layout you can make.</p>

<p>The picture below is just&nbsp;a small portion of my collection of classic Space sets. I still think it looks pretty darn good.</p>
