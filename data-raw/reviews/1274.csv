"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-07T19:31:42Z","great set","I got this set for Christmas '02.I was really hoping for one of the new castles,but this is really good to. This set has 2 red ninjas,1 dragon samurai,3 gems,and one black flintlock. One good thing about this set is it is great for two types of Lego fans; Pirate and Ninja. It is very well constructed. It is also very attractive with the black up arches in the back and intimidating with the spears in the front.I really can't fault this set except it is a bit un-realistic in the fact that there are ninjas for gaurds. A real samurai would have samurais for gaurds. But the ninja idea is preety cool to.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-20T11:45:01.24Z","Ryukyu","This is the smallest of the &quot;mainline&quot; 1999 Ninja sets and like its three sister sets from the same year, it makes up for what it lacks in quantity by quality.  This is probably the widest boat in the castle series to date with a 6-stud width and a 4-stud interior.  It's filled rather simply with the torches out in front, and a treasure compartment in the back with the seat for the lord above that.  The colours are decent, but the design is a bit too simple, but then again, this seems to be a flat-bottomed barge.  There isn't really an action feature of any sort, but there are definately nice design touches including the arches used in the stern of the boat, the chain for mooring and the little pier which adds to the play value.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-02T21:53:15.187Z","Shanghai Surprises","This set is a piece of work for Lego. I like the armor piece for the samurai. Since I never had ninjas, the minifigs were pretty cool. This is a nice set and it is really fun to play with. 5 out of 5 for a fun set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"thepeopleperson","2008-06-09T09:51:00.687Z","Kind of like a SW battle pack for ninjas... ","This is one of those sets where I just walked into Wal-Mart, in the mood for Lego, just grabbed something, bought it, and walked out.  It really turned out to be a pretty nice set though.

Pros:
Good value (I beleive it was $10?)
3 ninja minifigs (army builder)
Nice, simple design for the ship
2 of those cool ninja flags
Nore treasure (you can never have enough)

Cons:
I don't really get why they added that little 4 x 6 landing platform

Overall, this is a nice set, and if you buy it, you will not be dissapointed.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2010-10-28T12:16:25.75Z","Shanghai Surprise","<p>It was very pleasant to see LEGO do the Oriental theme and Ninja. For Castle, it was a build move away from the constant Western Europe Castles and sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this set was gotten for the Minifigures of Samurai and 2 Red Ninja, the chain, and chest with jewels and coins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It really is a nice little boat design though. There's a place for it moor and dock at. Though I do have to question why there's Ninja's with the Samurai as Guards and not more Samurai figures.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4

We get a seat for the shogun and there's a flag on each side which looks really nice. On the bottom you also get two seats for the red ninjas and behind the seats is a treasure chest with some gold and some gems in it. In the front of the seats is a brown box which has a nice ceiling on the top. Of course you can also hide your treasure in there if you want. On each side of the box you can see a spear. On the front of the box is a very nice lantern and the grill which has a chain on it. The chain has a little raft which is a nice addition to this model. You also get some paddles as well. All in all I think this is a nice set to play with and I love the design of that boat.

"Dash_Justice","2011-07-07T15:48:39.517Z","Before Ninjago...","<h4>The Good:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Awesome minifigures, two red Ninjas and a&nbsp;Samurai</li><li>Loads of accessories: 2 spears, 2 flags, 2 katanas, 4 oars, a musket, a pistol, a treasure chest, coins, crate and 3&nbsp;jewels.</li></ul>
<h4>The Bad:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Besides the&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;accessories, the rest of the bricks are pretty basic.</li></ul>
<h4>The Verdict:</h4>
<p>A decent set from an average theme. While Ninjago is not as&nbsp;realistic, I think it is a better theme.</p>",TRUE,3,5,3,5,3
"wander099","2010-12-19T15:00:22.393Z","Great theme","<p>This was one of my favourite themes and I wish I had been older when it came out so I could have bought more of it.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I didn't keep the box for this one because I was a kid when my parents gave it to me, but I did keep the instructions.&nbsp; It's just one short booklet and there are no parts boxes, but with the number of pieces, this isn't a problem.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts in this set are mostly black, tan, and blue.&nbsp; There is nothing really of note except for the flags and the four oars that are included.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get three with this set: the shogun and two red ninjas. Ignoring the historical error of having ninja (who were assassins) and samurai (who were honourable warriors) working together, these figures are great.</p><p>The shogun is the best figure.&nbsp; He comes with a black helmet with gold antlers, and I particularly like the historical accuracy of this bit.&nbsp; His face has an expression of intent and control, perfect for a samurai.&nbsp; He also comes with a grey armour piece, a pistol and a grey katana.&nbsp; His torso has detailed printing on the front that is also fairly accurate.&nbsp; It shows the inner and outer clothes, on the outer layer there are two printed dragons.&nbsp; There is also a sort of belt with something (a knife?) tucked into it.&nbsp; There are also gold patches printed on the top of the legs, representing armour.</p><p>The two ninjas are identical.&nbsp; They are dressed head to toe in red.&nbsp; Their masks have an attachment on the back for their swords and only reveal their eyes.&nbsp; Their torsos are printed on the front with robes, gold armour peeking out from underneath the robes, and a shuriken and knife is tucked into them.&nbsp; Aside from red being an impractical colour for a ninja, they look really nice.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is quick and easy.&nbsp; It is a small model and there are no complex steps.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This is one set that will always be a favourite of mine.&nbsp; The colours look really nice together and the ship is a good size for the number of pieces.&nbsp; The docking platform is a little silly, I kept dragging it around by accident.On the boat you get a treasure chest that slides out as well as a black riffle.&nbsp; Also, there is a hidden crate with jewels.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This set is excellent for adults and children.&nbsp; It is fun to play with and looks great as a display piece.&nbsp; I really wish I had more of the sets from this theme.&nbsp; Many of them (including this one) are excellent and in my opinion the old theme is overall better than the new theme, though I will admit that the new theme does have some nice sets (I just don't think ninjas should be fighting skeletons or wearing chinese hats).&nbsp; To sum it up, I strongly recommend this set.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
