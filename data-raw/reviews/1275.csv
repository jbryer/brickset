"Legoman1993","2007-01-05T00:39:01Z","GREAT ninja set!","I really like this set! I think the dragon design on this is pretty good The things I liked about this set is:the moving axes, two Gold grill  pieces , the Flag!,and how you can move the dragons mouth up and down.The cart is neat too!I have no red ninjas at all! well now I do! The large dragon can be used as a battering ram or something like that! for knights!or ninjas! The cannon part, well I did not get the SHOOTING cannon part.I got a non shooting cannon instead  because I got it {USED}But I can use a shooting cannon piece from my pirate set! I got it for under $10!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-20T09:33:34.74Z","Sushi","1999 was a good year for the Ninja subtheme, because although it only had 4 medium to big castle sets, what it lacked in quantity, it made up in quality.  There are two siege machines in this set a bigger 4-wheeled dragon with a cannon and a smaller &quot;fire-breathing&quot; dragon head and wings.

The smaller cart is well designed - from the front, the flames seem to be coming from the &quot;nose&quot; of the dragon cart.  The cart is equipped with handles for manual pushing.  Unlike the usual fire breathing carts though, the &quot;shield&quot; actually forms the eyes and eyebrows of the dragon's head.  The design feature is incredible, even if it doesn't have an active action feature.

The action features though, are on the bigger of the two components.  It's action features include moving spears on the front, a cannon, and a dragon head that opens its mouth to roar.  The last feature is actually more of a design issue - and a good design issue at that, to incorporate a dragon to the top of the cart, with the cannon at its belly to provide a shield for the people pushing the cart, and a flag for it's tail.

The smaller of the two carts seems to have been an afterthought to increase the piece count of this set, but both the components are well designed, well built and have complementary colours of red and black, which is what makes this such a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-22T21:31:36.2Z","For a Quick Attack","This is a very cool set for many reasons. The Ninja theme didn't last long, but many good sets were made like this one. There are two battle machines, one which looks like a dragon, and a cannon with wings. I like the dragon machine the best because it looks stronger and packs a punch with it. Overall, this set is fantastic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-11T12:09:05.28Z","LEGO Castle (Ninja) - Blaze Attack Review","It's been a while since I've written my last LEGO Castle (Ninja) review. Today I'll review a very cool looking ninja set. The built of the blaze attack set is very easy and lot's of fun. The whole set is very sturdy and you also won't have to worry about stickers. We get two red ninjas who look much different than the ninja Kai from the LEGO Ninjago theme which we've got this year. This set also has a small wagon which has two translucent orange fins and two fire pieces on the front.<br><br>The bigger wagon is the best part of the set. It has two translucent orange fins as well and it also comes with a cannon which really shoots. On the front you can slide two axes to the left and to the right and the 'mouth' of that dragon can be opened and you'll see some gems in there. I also like that big black flag piece. It's a cool set to have and I would recommend you to get it.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
