"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-01T00:00:00Z","","This is definetly the best designed ninja set. I had the white ninja, then some kid stole it. Plenty of good pieces for other buildings, and lots of treasure, a blue jewel, a green jewel, gold... I recommend this set for $45.00 USD or less. I commend the designers. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T17:55:01Z","Great!","When I was into ninja's, I simply HAD to have this set.  It has great figs.  It is one of the only sets with the white ninja.  It has a green gem, gold, and a buch of swords and spears.  Also, the white ninja has a flying thing with orange wings.  The samurai is a good fig too, since he has a cool hat and armor.  It comes with pretty good parts, especially creamy and black wavy pieces.  It has a floor that drops and it is pretty fun.  Overall this set is great, but I would have liked it to maybe come with another samurai or two.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-02T01:14:40Z","The Shadow Knows...","This is a good mid-sized set.  I like the overall design of the structure;  It is in keeping with the older Ninja sets, yet this medium castle can stand on its own.  I love the saddle design for the Emperor's horse, but I found the wings for the Ninja Princess and the treasure transport to be a minus for the set.  The decorations on the chest wasn't a bad idea- perhaps a black chest would do the trick?!  Then there is the lack of traps and other interesting features which had been the calling card of the Ninja sets, so this set gets an 8.  Overall, if you do get a chance to own this set, do so.  And Remember... Crime does not Pay!!!    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-25T07:30:20.143Z","Nagoya","This is the largest of the 1999 Ninja sets and is probably the worse one released of the year, although having said that, it's still better than a lot of the sets released in the previous years.  The use of the large rock wall instead of BURPs makes the fascade looks better, although there are BURPs in the back.  The door again is weak and can be easily opened, although like all other Ninja doors, it looks nice with the flag draped across the front.  The upper levels are more interesting, both architecturally and play feature-wise, with shutters on the windows and a cannon.  Extras include a rather nice flying ninja with no raft on his back, a grappling hook, a treasure chest and a soldier on horseback.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Lord_Demonico","2007-11-04T16:15:40.653Z","An Almost Perfect Set (In My Opinion)","I absolutly love this set! The horse barding is beautiful, and includes the rare White Princess Ninja figure (I think she's rare,is she?!?) However, the only flaw in the Ninja line, I believe, is The Emperor. I think he should be an old man in flowing robes rather than a young man in armour, like you see in the films. But thats just my opinion. I prefer the new Emperor from the Orient Expedition line, as he's old, robe wearing and staff bearing. Still, a brilliant set none-the-less!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-03T03:16:46.45Z","Awesome Ninja Set","Mid priced set with lots of cool mini figures and there are some great pieces to use with other creations you may come up with. I like the blue roof pieces you don't see them often. There is also some very long 1x bricks in this set, wish we could get them as bulk legos 1x16 if memory serves me. A great set with lots of playability I recommend it highly to everyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mars4life","2009-03-25T01:05:36.747Z","A good set from a great theme","Pros:<br>Cool design<br>Very tall<br>Great minifigures, especially the white ninja<br>Has a trapdoor with falling rocks and a cannon<br>I like the flaps on the front that allow the defenders to throw stuff down at the attackers<br><br>Cons:<br>Has some BURPS<br>There are no stairs or ladders to reach the upper levels<br>It would have been nice to have a throne for the emperor.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"WiseWarrior","2008-10-31T19:30:57.653Z","Another great Ninja set","A great set that has tons of awesome features, along with rare mini-figures and a killer design. The cannons fit in well, and the walls looks really good. The flying nija is a nice touch too. If you can find it for a reasonable price you should definitely grab it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-02T09:15:45.437Z","LEGO Castle (Ninja) - Emperor's Stronghold Review","If you don't cound the minifigure sets with the cards and the polybag sets from this theme this set will be the only set with a white ninja before we got the LEGO Ninjago theme early this year. This model has some cool play features. The doors on the front can be opened and&nbsp; on the top is a small balcony. On the first level you can see a floor which can disappear if you move the lever. When the floor disappears you can drop the rocks on the enemies. You can also throw those pieces out of the windows if you move the black doors up. Next to the windows you can see a lantern as well.<br><br>On the second level we get a cannon which you can shoot. There're also no stickers which you have to worry about and we also get a horse, a small glider for the white ninja and a treasure chest which is transported by the two red ninjas. It's a cool set to have and it's worth the money for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
