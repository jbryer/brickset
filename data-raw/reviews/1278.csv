"zniesmaczony","2022-01-22T22:36:44.897Z","So is it a System or Technic?","<p>It&#39;s hard for me to review such a small set because what&#39;s there to review? Just another micro scale technic motorcycle. with rubber band suspension, the same as in models 1259, 2544. So that&#39;s about it. What got me surprised though is that when I bought&nbsp;the model on Bricklink and it came to me, I found out that the picture on the box is different than the one shown here and it has a Technic logo, instead of System which kinda made me happy because I collect a TECHNIC motorcycles and this one was kind of Technic, since it has the label System. And suddenly such a shock.&nbsp;Oh well. Another addition to my collection I suppose.</p>
