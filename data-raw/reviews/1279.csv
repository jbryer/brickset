This also have the minifigure of Johnny thunder, the main character of the theme. The car have a different front, to looks like with old cars. Like the other promotional cars, it isn't very complete, because few pieces can't build a complete car, but other vehicles like rafts or carts. The colors are great, like the details of the minifigure, that combines with a little plate on the base of the car. The wheels are too little and low, but it combines with the car's front. Is cool for a little set, is rare now, like the minifigure of Johnny Thunder. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"legoguysw","2008-05-24T15:46:59.17Z","A promotion for you, and your Lego men collection...","Promotionsl sets are great, they can hand out a load of cool figs and pieces, all for free. This one is no different, featuring the great Johnny Thunder fig, who i think is absolutely beautiful. This set was where i got my only Johnny Thunder fig, whom i treasure. So the car may be a bit rubbish, and more like a kids cardboard box go-cart, but hey, you don't lose anything, its free, plus you get a cool grill piece, and some yummy corn flakes!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
