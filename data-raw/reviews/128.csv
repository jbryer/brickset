It is a very simple design which I could have made. However, is there supposed to be an engine in the back? Personally, Lego should go back to the simple design in the town sets. 5 out of 5 for a great small set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The boat is a small, basic set, but a few of these grouped together in a marina look fantastic, you could even have seven or eight and build a rental office , mooring pontoons and you have an instant hire boat centre!   I have adopted the basic style of the boat and made many different variations, some with covered steering areas and on some I have used the inverted windshields (part number 4284) to make small offshore angling boats – the sky really is the limit once you have the necessary hull parts.

This set, as standard, features a jet black hull with red stripe and black deck and forepeak.   Slightly aft of the forepeak is a small red area which could be a hatch.   Amidships is the tinted blue sports style windshield, yellow steering wheel and small cockpit which can seat the minifig supplied (she’s dressed in a white suit with life vest and red ponytail).   As mentioned previously, there does not appear to be an engine present on this set, I wonder why?   I have modified mine to accept the traditional tilting outboard motor – it looks better with it.

A great addition to your marina, beach or for towing behind a car.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
