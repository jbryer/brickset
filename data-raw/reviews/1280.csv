The vehicle structure is exactly the same and so is the numbered placard in the front. The minifig however has a clear helmet screen here but I do not remember if the face is the same with the 1096 driver. Also here the minifig has a white Octan outfit whereas the driver of the 1096 Race Buggy sports a red Octan outfit.
