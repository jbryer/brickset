<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box shows a few of the different cars racing down the track. It looks cool, and it's set up well. The parts are packaged safely, and the instructions are a thick book-very durable.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set only has 105 parts. This is NOT a good value in cents per part. The most notable parts (for me) are the printed piece (great), the clear engine, the piston, and the wheels. There is also a lot of yellow TECHNIC parts.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>This set has many builds, ranging from one to three bricks. None are hard-this isn't the one to three bricks of Designer Sets, but a one to three bricks of something intended for younger kids. I was not challenged in any of these.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>There are many. They are all pretty decent, a few of them look quite nice. The formula race car is my favorite.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a fairly nice set. It's the most advanced and the best-built of the ""Master Builder"" sets from 2000, so if you can get it at a good price it's worth it.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,5,4,3
