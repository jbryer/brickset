I enjoy the book the most because of all of the ideas included in the instructions. One would think that this idea would be successful. I know there was a space themed set just like this but I didn't buy it because I enjoy the city theme the most. I guess these sets were too expensive at their original retail price through LEGO. It is a great idea. The book included with this set is beautifully designed and I am glad that I own it. The book is geared towards young fans of LEGO and has many many ideas and directions so you can build different vehicles to travel through your city set up. It includes 1 minifig to drive these vehicles. Some of the models range in detail and realism from excellent to poor. I would recommend this set to children and see what wonderful things they create out of this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
