"Moscadini","2008-02-15T23:03:50.873Z","Simple + build book and guide","Yea, it is small and simple and has many ideas to build other stuff from them, but it is a great way to expand your Space Port set.  It is also great for kids because not only it gives you a little bit about the Space History (how an astronaut becomes an astronaut), but it has a cute book of ideas with a story.  It reminds me a little bit on the Young Adult sci-fi book set: &quot;The Young Astronauts&quot;",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MasterBuilder","2009-01-04T20:08:02.187Z","Good","Nice set, lots of variety, and plenty of pieces. Instruction book comes with plenty of mini structures, and it's a great space expansion set.

On the down side, only 1 or 2 minifigs, but if you are just going to add on to your Space Port collection, who cares?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>â€¦</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has only 90 parts, which is a very pitiful amount. That means it's 22 cents per part. Thankfully, we get an astronaut, but it's not much consolation. Key parts in this set are the black wheels, chrome radar dishes, white wings, and trans light blue cockpit pieces.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get an astro. Better than the other Master Builder sets, which have none, but it doesn't really make up for the piece counts.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is not horrible, but it could have been better. Aesthetically, none of the builds are beautiful. They do, however, fit nicely into the theme (Space Port). They're rated 1, 2, or 3 bricks by difficulty, but even the toughest are very simple (maybe 8 dollar set).<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>There are many different models. None are really amazing, but they appeal to younger children. I can't say I love any of them, but I don't hate them either.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would recommend this set for up to 12 dollars. Any more and it's really too much. The set isn't amazing, but it has a few nice parts and some nice features. The Master Builder sets in general wasn't so great. The TECHNIC were the best, the Town ones were awful, and there wasn't really anything special about the sets. The builds were dull, the models were pretty bland, and the price counts were horrific.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,3
