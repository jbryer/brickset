"Novelty","2007-07-16T05:49:22.183Z","We have Liftoff!","On its own, this set is pretty much useless.  But put a few of them together with just one tiny spaceship and this is great as a landing spot for the ship.  This set is great with a space base as well as it then extends the base's ability to handle aircraft, much like an airport.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-11-05T21:02:05.95Z","The more the more magnificent","I agree on it's own this set doesn't do much, but combined with other base sets with crater plates it really adds to the play experience.

And if you can get multiple sets, the fun increases exponentially.  Imagine having three or six or ten of these laid out for a mega Starbase!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-12-28T05:49:29.827Z","Terra Firma for Lunar Landings…","I have four of these in my collection, and they make great bases for space stations and lunar bases.   

I usually arrange the craters (305) around the perimeter of my space station and use these bases in the centre for space craft landings and for the storage of vehicles.   They are really useful items and provide a solid platform for construction … you can’t have too many!

An excellent addition to any lunar landscape!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Hitokiri_2000","2022-07-09T04:35:46.34Z","No space collection is complete without some of these.","<p>This will not really be your typical review. I hope you enjoy it anyway.</p>

<p>Well, as the title says. No Space collection is complete without minimum&nbsp;one of this set.</p>

<p>I have a good portion of these plates in my own collection,&nbsp;it really helps to create a great landscape. Follow the link below to see some of my Space collection.</p>

<p>Another set it&#39;s hard to ignore when making good layouts are the Lunar crater&nbsp;plates. Combine those with this set, and you are well on your way to have a great layout, of course the more you have of each of these two sets the better layout you can make.</p>

<p>The picture below is just&nbsp;a small portion of my collection of classic Space sets. I still think it looks pretty darn good.</p>
