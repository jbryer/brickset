"TheCanadien","2015-03-05T15:49:47.327Z","Excellent Classic Promotional Set","<p>This set was released in 1985 as a Canada Post promotion, and in my opinion is an excellent set compared to sets from that era.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the standard style for that time, with a picture clearly showing what you get, the parts count, the set number, and the Lego and Legoland logos.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are nothing spectacular, with the only notable pieces being 2 1x6 bricks with Canada Post printing on them, and a 2x4 brick with red diagonal stripes,&nbsp;but they themselves are great to have. Otherwise it uses a common windscreen, cab piece,&nbsp;tires, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is one minifigure&nbsp;in this set, who is made of common worker/truck driver parts. There&#39;s not much to say about him.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build starts with the truck, then finishes the trailer. The truck was fun to build, and is interesting for the short duration of the build. At the end of this part the minifigure is assembled. The trailer uses an interesting technique to incorporate&nbsp;the 2x4 brick, (see &quot;Parts&quot;) but uses a repetitive layering of 1x whatever bricks to make up the main body. this minimizes the amount of available cargo space, to 2 studs wide.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a detailed (for its time) semi-truck with Canada post colors making up the majority of the color palette. For the amount of parts used it is a decent size. The minifigure fits into the cab easily, and comes out with similar ease.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I think this is a great set, and would fit well into any collection of town sets from a similar time. If you find it for a decent price it is definitely&nbsp;worth getting.</p>

<p>All Samsonite Promotional Lego sets made in Canada were meant to be &quot;sealed&quot; only by the tab box seals closed instead of the Lego&#39;s classic transparent stickers in both ends of the boxes. In addition to that,&nbsp;only some parts were placed&nbsp;in plastic transparent bags and most of them, especially the bigger ones were loose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from the 2 great looking printed bricks 1x6 with the Canadian flag and the &quot;Canada Post&quot; both in English and French languages, it contains the even rarer&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.toysperiod.com/lego-set-reference/parts/bricks/decorated-bricks/3001pb23_brick-2-x-4-with-angled-red-stripes-between-two-horizontal-red-stripes-pattern/"" title=""3001pb23 Brick 2 x 4 with Angled Red Stripes Between Two Horizontal Red Stripes Pattern"">Brick 2 x 4 with Angled Red Stripes Between Two Horizontal Red Stripes Pattern</a>.<br />
<br />
This lorry was the most &lsquo;&rsquo;look alike to real&rsquo;&rsquo; for the 4-stud category, with the identifying 3-axle Tractor and 2-axle Semi trailer, exactly as the real trucks are build in the Canada and the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The European versions instead use 2-axle Tractors with 3-axle Semi trailers. This is happening due to the differences of the maximum pay load laws and distances to be covered, between the continents.<br />
<br />
I can still remember my reaction when I first saw this set, it was love at first sight!<br />
<br />
That&rsquo;s why for me it&rsquo;s Simply Beautiful.</p>

There&#39;s only one problem, where&#39;s the mail? If this was your very first lego set, what would you transport? I think playability is important and overall, i think this is a great set except for the fact that there&#39;s nothing to deliver!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some interesting features:</p>

<p>Trailer props up with stand.</p>

<p>Back doors open.</p>

<p>Trailer comes off.</p>
