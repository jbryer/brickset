"Gus_263","2008-03-17T17:22:08Z","Very well made","This is a set with lego quality, little, but cool for one. Two mini vehicles with two minifigures with green parts. The green colors, light or dark, are very cool, included previously in space sets, no very in the new mars mission. The two have fun, they looks like one to other, and is easy to make a new vehicle with the two. Like promotional, a small set, but still good, and more if it is an insectoid. I rate 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set may be tiny, but it rocks out loud. The minifigure has a great color scheme and he actually looks like an insect. The ship is small but looks really great and can probably travel at high speeds.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
