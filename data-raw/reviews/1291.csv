This wasn't released as a normal set, but as one packaged with sweets, and this can be considerated an exclusive of Japan. But this isn't very an exclusive because it's pieces are common and is easy build with them many forms of building, more than space planes, but considerable little spaceships if with more small sets. The pack of the set shows two different ways of building, but the playability of them like be the same. 

Features and characteristics makes this small promotional an insectoid, like the glowing green parts and the blue ones. The minifigure too, a black one, that can be played as alien in the original lego shape, more compatible with space ships, being better than the new ones (from mars mission). The minifigure too can hangs the two controls of the vehicle, that are useful contents for any controls for spaceships, or maybe, cars. Have too claw pieces where are located two special green pieces in one image on the pack (the bigger one). And too a blue plate with two sticks where are, in the same image, another two glowing green pieces. This includes too a blue disc piece and too a ramp piece, and some plates under the building of the set to this turns more solid. 

The playability is basic but still cool, because this is a small set. This now can be hard to find, once that was released in Japan, but the pieces can be found in other insectoid sets. For a small set (and a promotional one), this deserves a good rate, a 5/5.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
