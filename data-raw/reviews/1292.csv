Like the other three promotional insectoids sets from kabaya sweets, can be considered as exclusives on building, but don't on pieces, because they were included with other sets. The contents are basic, and the playability too, but the design is very cool. The pack of the set shows two different types of building, but with these pieces (very useful for any space subtheme) is easy make more. The contents are few, but useful, and I will say about who are them, in the building of the bigger image on the pack:

A blue plate is under all the building of the small vehicle, above this have too other plates, special ones with jets (with glowing green parts on their backs) or with sticks, where are putted two glowing green cone parts. Have too at the front of the set a ramp piece with a little plate with designs of control panels (as in the ramp piece and also in the plate above it), and the minifigure, with the glowing helmet, good for any minifigure from space, astronauts, aliens, or robots (in the original and better lego minifigure shape). The minifigure can be placed on a chair piece, and on back of this are placed parts from missiles pieces, that can be detailed with glowing pieces. This was a description of the pieces, but have many descriptions for the many types of buildings that can be made with that. 

The playability is the same of all little space set, makes this little vehicle flies. This set can turns bigger if with more sets that looks likes with this. Now this set, 3072, is hard to find, but the contents can be found on other sets from the insectoids subtheme. The pieces are useful, being from this set, or of all this subtheme. In comparison with the space theme, and with small sets, this deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
