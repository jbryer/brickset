"Gus_263","2008-05-22T09:20:27.827Z","The &quot;Kana Booster&quot;","This is another small set of the insectoids theme, and is also a promtional, released in the year of 1999. This set was only released with the kabaya sweets, it is so much rare now, and was rare when released, too. As a promotional, this set is ust small, because the promotional sets must be small, or these will make the product expensive. So, it must be compared with promotional sets.

This set is at the first view, well designed, more due to the color schemes, the common blue colors, with some black or grey details and the translucent green pieces, much common among the insectoids subtheme. The minifigure included is another good addition to any space set, sue to the printed details, and another itens, like the blue jetpack and translucent green helmet. The minifigure have the Lego original minifigure shape, altough is an alien, it have the original playability and is more useful than the current aliens, due to the shape, a great minifigure. The vehicle included is much small, of course, it is a promotional set, but still well made to a small one.

Made by some blue plates used as the base, this vehicle features the nice color scheme of the insectoids. The minifigure stay well in the chair, it have a good shape to put the minifigure, with the jetpack. All the pieces are useful and common with the insectoids sets, pieces like the translucent green &quot;flashlights&quot;, the two on the front have the shape of a cone, and on the back have circular shape, are fitted on the back of the chair, stay very well and don't dismantle easy when playing. More useful pieces are the black &quot;turbos&quot;, also common to increase the insectoids spaceships , and other small plates, with the translucent green color scheme again.

The set is nice in the color scheme and design, in comparison with the small sets, and also so much useful to increase other insectoids sets. The playability is sometimes boring, because it is really small (of course, it is a promotional). This set never was released without the kabaya sweets, can be regarded as a special edition set, but is so much small. Overall, this is a nice addition, but it could get some more itens, I think. Really, it is a good small addition to any Lego space fan from the 1990's times. It is now rare, more than before, this can be expensive, altough the set is small. This set is hard to find, but if you get this one by a price like the new impulse, it can be a great chance to get some insectoids stuff. I rate this set a 4,7 of 5, regarding this as a small promotional set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

 The cyborg is a very cool minifig which comes with dark gray pants, a blue belt, dark gray arms, blue hands, a transparent yellow helmet, a blue jetpack and a black torso with some cool markings on it.

This set is not my favourite LEGO Space (Insectoids) set because it doesn't have any play features. There're two engines on each side and on the back and there's a laser on each side in the front. You can also see the controls and the seat there. It's a good set to get that minifig and for some cool pieces which you can use for MOC's but I would pick up some other sets of the LEGO Space (Insecoids) theme.<br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br><br></span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br>Great pieces which you can use for brickfilms or MOC's<br>Minifig<br>Great starter set<br><br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br>No play features<br><br><br>All
