Basically, it's just a pair of wings, a flag and a flappy thing attached to a plate with a minifig on top.  One has to make a large jump of imagination to picture this as a flier.  What could have been improved?  Perhaps if this was made into a flying carpet of sorts, or maybe something with the wings attached to the arms of the ninja.  A lot more could have been done with this concept.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

This features red ninjas minifigures, don't hard to find in the year that was released, but yes for now. And too two wings, two flags, and more black and blue pieces, used sometimes in the older sets. This is a small set because was made to be packaged with sweeets, and if it was greater, the costs of the sweet was more expensive too. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
