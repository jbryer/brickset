First of all, there's the lamp on the front of the boat.  Nothing new there, but this is probably the first time that the lamp has been affixed to a boat.  This is also the first set with a plate attached to a minifig to represent his hat.  It's comical, but with the wizards beard, it works.  The alternate model shows a winged person that's just comical though...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-26T16:07:01.873Z","Ninja Boat","Another small set of the ninja theme, this don't includes a ninja, but another cool minifigure that looks like a sensei with a beard, also included on the wizards of the castle theme, and a piece used as his hat. The boat is good builted for a small set, without the pieces previously included in the pirates theme. A crystal is included, with a barrel. For a small set, this is useful, the playability isn't very great due to the size, but still good also in building, i rate this 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
