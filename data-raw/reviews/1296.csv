This is some weird gender-equality thing because there really haven't been any female Ninjas in the past.  The set is mediocre - the cart seems to be only there to increase the parts count and serves little to no purpose.  It would have been better if there were a horse to pull the cart or something.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-27T15:42:57.64Z","Rare ninja set","I made the review of the same set previously, but this had antoher number, because this was the another version, packaged with sweets on japan. The tank is cool because have a flag and two axes, useful like the two black katana. Is easy to put the minifigure in the tank, and it is useful, very compatible with carts of another themes with the same wheels, like from the castle. This is a rare set, with rare content, like the minifigure, and is more rare rare this version, packaged with sweets released on japan. I rate this small set 5/5, good for one, with exclusive contents. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
