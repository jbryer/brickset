"Novelty","2007-08-18T13:24:22.787Z","Katana","This is a small little set, and at first glance it seems boring.  What the packaging shows though is an alternate picture for the set showing how the &quot;base&quot; can be converted into a &quot;bed&quot;.  As a &quot;base&quot; it looks funny.  It's only a bunch of bricks with 2 flame pices and a flag that's a bit too close to the flames for comfort.  As a bed though, it looks interesting with the flag at the head and the 2 flaming lamps on the side (which presumably can be extinguished before sleep).",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-26T16:24:31.233Z","Samurai figure","The shogun's minifigure is included in this small set, with some useful pieces, like the completed base, used too as throne to the minifigure. The two fire pieces and flag are pieces for lego environment. The minifigure have an armor to the body, a helmet and a black katana, weapon compatible with also technic. This is a small set, and the objective of the set is sale as one. This is included with sweets, if this was bigger, the costs of the set and of the sweets were too. This is useful too, the colors can be compatible with another schemes, and the playability is little due to the size. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
