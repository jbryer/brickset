<p>A note to the Brickset site, this set does not contain 137 pieces, it contains 31 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is classic, a flip cover, so you can see all the pieces in all their glory. The pieces are laid out in styrofoam with a thin&nbsp; transparent plastic cover over it.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>My set didn&#39;t come with instructions, and I think that is how it came, but I&#39;m not sure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some suggestions on the box on what you can do with this set.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The parts are quite unique by todays standards, the battery box uses C batteries [I think, might actually be D batteries], three in total, so the set is a 4.5V set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The motor itself is very big, but it houses a host of possibilities to configure your vehicle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set is outdated and only interesting for the oldest of AFOL&#39;s.&nbsp;<br />
BUT, if you grew up on LEGO in the 70&#39;s, and you want a nostalgia fix AND have some fun too, get this set !</p>
