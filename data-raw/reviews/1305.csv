It comes with enough pieces to rearrage the track and surroundings. The part that shoots the cars down the track work very well, you can combine all of the track and the car will travel the entire length. I liked this set so much I bought two as gifts for small nephews of mine. Good amount of people with set a plus and it does something keeps little one busy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul><li>Just some building!</li><li>It's Duplo. (not&nbsp;important!)</li><li>The track is a bit short!</li><li>The paper&nbsp;length&nbsp;measurer does rip.</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>First of all, this set contains lots of things that can also be used for making gas&nbsp;stations, Train layouts, roller coasters, and much more. It contains two slammers. They work really well, even with the train carriage in the 3327. They even work so well that the cars race off the short track! You could put the tracks together, then it would be much&nbsp;easier. I really liked all the trophies in this, both the big one and the small trophy bricks. It also contains a Video Camera, which I just love, and a little Duplo boy.</p><p>Overall, this was a great set, and it still is. Anyone will enjoy this set (but mostly small ones)!!</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,3
