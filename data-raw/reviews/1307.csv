Simple set with wheelbarrel to cart around things and best of all it appeals to girls, if you happen to have one or your shopping list.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

After much search, four of these have landed on my doorstep over the years.<div><br></div><div>The are perfect for gardeners of any age, and who does not like to grow a little plant that sometimes even becomes a little bit bigger plant before it croaks or gets eaten by one of the millions of predators in our yard..... Add a cute cat, cute girl, and cute carrots and you are in business.</div><div><br></div><div>This is a way for everyone to grow plants that never die. Wow! Bring in the Lone Ranger and the cavalry and tell them that they are fired from watching over our sickly plants 24/7.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My absolute favorite part is the tiny greenhouse! I proudly own four of them and would sleep with them if it would not damage them and hubby was out of town for the night.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>They are without a doubt one of the best pieces TLG has ever made. Period. If you combine two of them, they fit perfectly behind a Pink (4966) or Blue (9225) Duplo Playhouse, so let the good times begin, folks! You can even plant Duplo babies and kids in them and use them as a babysitter in the backyard. Just make that our little secret, okay?</div><div><br></div><div>TLG needs to put this greenhouse in every DUPLO farm and playhouse set they sell. Too many DUPLOs inspire violent play, themes like pirates, castles, police, etc. Let's go back to the non-violent basics and focus on zoos, farms and playhouses so our little ones get a break from the heavier topics in life.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thank you LEGO! You make me smile every day!</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
