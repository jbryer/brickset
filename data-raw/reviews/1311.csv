Car is very sturdy and can be used(abused) by toddlers. Like the hose to fill up other cars in Duplo Town. Good solid set, fits in nice with Duplo towns, I may be wrong but there is not a wide selection of vehicles available in the recent Duplo sets. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Runs on&nbsp;Duplo&nbsp;tracks!</li><li>Flexible hose!</li><li>Minifig logo matches to truck!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Easy to build.</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>This&nbsp;seemed&nbsp;like it was a nice set when I was little. You can&nbsp;see&nbsp;that it has many pros. What is most interesting is that it is compatible with Duplo tracks. The only con will not apply very much to small kids.</p><p>Overall, nice set, great for little kids.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3
