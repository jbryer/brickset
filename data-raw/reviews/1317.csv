This set is a great example of this. It comes with 46 common pieces of the time and comes with a few nice surprises.</p>

<p>The best parts in the set ate the classic 2x2 printed eye bricks and the 2x4 smile/ frown printed brick. Another great piece is the rarer 4x12 green brick. I would have likes to get more of these larger bricks as bases, but we don&#39;t see them anymore.</p>

<p>The box has some nice suggestions of things that you can build including some buildings, some animals, and a person.</p>

<p>Overall, this was a great set for beginners and a nice parts expansion pack for older builders.</p>
