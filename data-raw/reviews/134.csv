This set was released in 1999, as one from the subtheme named extreme team, where some sets were from vehicles of adventures, like of climbing. This small set don't have the objective to be a vehicle for sports, and this is very small to be one, but is in a good size to be a small cart for minifigures, like in a set from the shell promotionals (2535), with a pilot. But isn't a problem don't have a minifigure, if you have one, you can put this on this car. Is easy say that don't have a minifigure is a problem from this set, but is easy see too that this set was originally a promotional from shell (2886), one of the initially. 

I will review the contents of this set, these will justify the rate. They are basically a plate with wheels (yellow ones, that keeps the building of the set solid), yellow plates above this piece and under the ramp piece (with a printed number one). And too these same plates under other ramp pieces, on the sides, keeping the same design of ramp on the front of the set. On the back of the bigger ramp piece (that is placed on the front of the set) is placed the place for the minifigure, the same thing of the set 2535 and on this back, have too a yellow plate where are located a piece that all minifigures can hang (minifigures in the original lego shape, also that have hooks), a black rail one, two gray cone pieces, and a plate with too sticks, very used on the old lego sets, making these useful. Have too the moveable spoiler, on the colors of the set.

The complete set have cool colors, like black, yellow, gray, and the red on the detail of a number one, to make effect. The colors make too the contents useful. The playability is basic, like from the small cars and promotional ones, that have to make the driver drives the car (or if this don't have, yourself makes the car run), and the wheels makes this set runs very well. The idea of the set is that this have few contents and be small, because this was first a promotional (The lego promotionals never were big sets), and due to that, this need be compared with the idea, contents and playability of the set, to justify the rate. If you find lego cool, if you have two minifigures from a set, why you can't put one of them on this set? And this set, altough small, isn't unimpressive or a bad way, but a PROMOTIONAL. My rate in overall to this set (and for the set 2886) is a 5/5.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"redbeardlegoman","2013-02-12T16:17:58.05Z","Great Efficiency of Parts on Great Car","<p>With only 25 parts, we have a delightful little race car in this set. &nbsp;The car itself is instantly recognizable for what it is, has spoilers front and back, as well as a little engine. &nbsp;It would be very easy for a MOC builder to make several versions of this, in differing colours and with modifications, without a huge investment in parts on secondary seller sites. &nbsp;At low cost, as entire set of competing racers could be built. &nbsp;While it may benefit from a minifigure, perhaps we don't always need to have one in a set designed for minifigure use.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Excellent efficiency of a small part count, with a relatively high level of detail.</li><li>Good looking and instantly recognizable for what it is.</li><li>Easy and affordable to customize or recreate.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>No minifigure. (Half con)</li></ul>
<p>True, there is no minifigure, but perhaps that isn't needed in this nice little set that works wonders with just 25 parts.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
