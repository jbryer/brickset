"Novelty","2008-02-14T11:09:23.797Z","Big Box of Tools","This is a small set, and like some of the small sets, there is hardly any building involved. The set consists mostly of a box with a variety of tools, a minifig, and a few extras. Although there is no building involved, this set is great for obtaining the smaller parts cheaply, including the magnifying glass and the printed dynamite piece.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-01T18:27:28.543Z","The first Johnny thunder","This set is named Johnny Thunder, the name of the main character of the adventurers and of the orient expedition sets, is the minifigure included on the set. Is easy to put a bad rate because it is little, but i put on this the 5/5 rate because is useful to one. Some small sets are army builders or have a small building, but this includes some itens in a chest, itens like the glass and the scorpion piece. The dynamite is cool, included in the western theme, is a little piece with a print. The minifigure have a hat, a bag, and a shotgun with it. These are useful things for make a lego scenery, without a building or many minifigures. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"F260","2011-12-07T21:19:26.527Z","Small but good ","The set is kind of useless expect for the pieces and the awesome Johnny Thunder minifigure with a back pack that can really hold TNT and other tools. It comes with a random green baseplate which I don't know why it's there, the set has a gem which is nice. You can't really get much from this set except for the value of a 1998 set. Not much to it. I would recommend this set if it was still 4 dollars but for 20 or more dollars on e-bay and Amazon I would not get it.",FALSE,4,4,2,2,3
"Gameaucracy","2015-03-23T03:57:07.747Z","Johnny Thunder, My Middle Name Is Danger","<p>Wow, this takes me back to when I was a rosy-cheek child all right. Back when income tax was just a word mommy and daddy said and all I had to worry about was not falling off the jungle gym. Again. Still. But anyway&nbsp;this was one of the first sets I got, back when I had to share my LEGO with my brother DAMN YOU DEREK WHY DID YOU SWITCH THE HEADS YOU MADMAN?!?</p>

<p>Sorry, these reviews are bringing up some stuff. Anyways onto the other bits.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>No, I refuse to describe the box. I can&#39;t even remember what it looked like, this was back when I was a little feral monster using up my parent&#39;s money. I&#39;m pretty sure the box disintegrated&nbsp;beneath my excited paws.</p>

<p>As for instructions, I think the set speaks for itself. It is mostly a &quot;booster pack&quot; as I like to call it (Hockey cards reference,&nbsp;HA! They said it couldn&#39;t be done). There wasn&#39;t really anything to put together, except maybe &quot;put hat on head&quot;. Probably should have paid more attention to this because I&#39;m pretty sure I lost that hat within one week. Hmm...</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>This is one of the reasons you love this set: lots of little parts to use with your other sets. Lots of nice little bits in here. There was a scorpion for those who like animals you can&#39;t pet, a magnifying glass if you&#39;re the type that made Johnny Thunder go to school for a few years to get his archeology degree before he was allowed to adventure, and a gun because you don&#39;t need an explanation for why that is just dandy-and-a-half now.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>Here is the other reason:&nbsp;Johnny Thunder. This wasn&#39;t your ordinary minifigure. This was a manly-man that did manly things. He didn&#39;t take no guff from no&nbsp;one (especially because he was the only figure in the set); I mean, with a mustache like that how could anyone get in your way. And an ascot? Oh stop that&#39;s too much badass&nbsp;for one little old set.</p>

<h3><strong>The Build</strong></h3>

<p>There isn&#39;t really a build to be had here. Just a minifigure and some parts. Which probably explains why it took me a few hours to get this sucker finished. I&#39;m supposed to do WHAT with the backpack? Are you mad LEGO? I&#39;m just a poor boy, I need all the sympathy.</p>

<h3><strong>(Deleted the other two categories because I can. What!)</strong></h3>

<p>So overall this is a great set and I recommend heading down to the local Walgreens and picking up one. What, the set isn&#39;t for sale anymore? Well then, I would probably just grab some toothpaste while you&#39;re down there then, I see you&#39;re running a bit low there.</p>

<p><strong>Score:&nbsp;One scorpion out of a box of toothpaste.</strong></p>

"losinglemo","2019-03-20T20:41:20.82Z","Get what you see, Johnny Thunder.","<p>An easy way to acquire a classic. Considering the price of Lego Adventurer sets this is currently the easiest an cheapest way to get a sealed adventurer set. The set itself is exactly what you see on the box.</p>

<p>Minifigure</p>

<p>Johnny Thunder in all his classic glory. Arguably one of the best Lego original heroes (Despite glaring resemblance to Indiana Jones) and is the main feature of the set. Featuring his iconic hat and in his original desert adventure torso. There&#39;s no adventure in time or space that Johnny can&#39;t fit into. There&nbsp;are no limits to imagination and possibilities.</p>

<p>Build and Accessories</p>

<p>There is no build beyond a 6x2 plate and a box of accessories to ensure Johnny is fully kitted out for wherever you send him. A spade for excavation, Magnifying glass for inspection, an opening and closing rucksack for storage, Dynamite tile for... creative/destructive means and a small arsenal&nbsp;of fire arms consisting of&nbsp;two revolver pistols and a rifle to fight off any marauders coming his way, including the scorpion lurking in the sand around him and finally a storage crate.</p>

<p>A lovely little nostalgic set of a childhood long gone. My only criticism is the set&nbsp;lacks any form of instructions or little advertisements which would have been a nice little addition to look over. despite not being needed.</p>
