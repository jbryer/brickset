The overall look is not bad at all, but the building is really quite simple and takes too short time to complete (probably has less than 40 pieces). Furthermore, the minifigures do not fit inside because the roof is too low. There is serious room for improvement.

The boat section pieces always lower the building value of boat sets, and increase the price per piece, but don't look bad. The set comes with a special weight piece that can be attached below to allow the boat to float in water quite well.

The set has a few rare pieces that aren't found in post-'70s sets: the 2x1 clear-transparent slopes and the two technic pieces that make the antenna.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

I'm sure my parents still have some of the pieces in their basement, but the boat itself is long gone.  The best thing about this set - it floats!  Worst thing about this set - it doesn't stand up to modern Lego creations, not by a long shot.  Still, it was a great toy for kids in the '70's.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Alright&nbsp;amount of pieces, build is very easy, but it is still good build, love to have it in my shelf, and it is so great little classic.</p>
