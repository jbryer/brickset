"AddictedToStyrene","2007-11-10T04:40:39.36Z","GoKart!","This is a cute and simple little set that has a little in common with classic space buggies. Although the size of Lego cars has been increasing in recent years, this would still be OK as a GoKart or similar on a little track. At least it doesn't have a juniorised one-piece chassis like some late '90s sets!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's simplified design shows that a few pieces can make a huge difference. I wished they'd put a proper front bumper, though. The minifig is the usual 'cool boy with sunglasses' kid and is sporting a red Octan racing jumpsuit. The vehicle moves very smoothly and you don't hear any little squeaks as you might do from other tyres.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
