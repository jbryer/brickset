It also had the balast weights that connected to the bottom so that it would not overturn.  Many hours of fun.  Only drawback is that it wasn't minifig size.  I made my own modifications though and turned it into a mini tugboat.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-27T08:46:50.64Z","Partially interesting","One of the earliest boats to use big section pieces. These pieces look good, possibly even better than more recent ones, but definitely devalue the model since you cannot use them for anything else than building a boat. At least, this model has 5 sections, so you have some opportunity to rebuild it as a 2-, 3-, 4- or 5-sections boat.

Some interesting ideas can be seen in the design of the water guns, which are build with Technic pieces and mounted on turntables.

Possibly pieces to look for in this set are the low fences, the baseplate with a hole, and the transparent pieces, particularly the round corner clear-transparent piece.

The model is not in scale with Legoland, and in fact it doesn't contain minifigures, but it can be of course modified to suit that purpose.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
