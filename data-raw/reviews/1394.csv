minis"" series, and these by far, look excellent, and a great, 
cheap parts source for those of you who like smaller models. 
However, due to their size, they serve little function other 
than eye candy, but, contain have that ever eminent ""swooshability"" 
factor, so all the power to them. For alternate models, several
boxes of these minis could be warranted, but with even a small
parts supply, a lot of these ships could easily be assimilated
to build a fleet, and serve well on game boards and RPGs. My
overall opinion? These serve as a great gift, to the SW afficionado,
of non lego fan alike, and their price is reasonable as well,
compared to other non-lego SW mini vehicle merchandise. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Whilst I can't really complain as it cost me nothing I think it can be made to look so much better with the addition of some parts. 2 Blue conical 1 x bricks from the mini TIE advanced can be used to attatch the body to the &quot;wings&quot;, rather than the black towing hooks which are discarded. This is done by turning the wings round to have the studs facing outwards putting the 4 x 2 plates on the inside attatching to the conical bricks using the centre hole. The gap in the centres of the outside of the wings is filled with a couple of black 2 x 2 tiles. A clear blue 1 x round tile on the back for the engine completes the job. If Lego had done this I would have given it 10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Remember thinking that Mini figures were a good idea, as it meant you could build up a fleet of craft without needing that much room to store them.  With only 12 bricks used, this model does give a very good impression of the TIE fighter seen in the original Star Wars movie: the only things dropping my score are its relative lack of availability, and the fact that I really wanted it to be a TIE Interceptor!

"Gus_263","2008-03-27T14:02:47.86Z","The Mini TIE Fighter","This set includes 12 pieces and is a mini sized version of the TIE fighter. This was released in 2002 as a promotional release, so, due to be a promotional, this set is small. One of the Mini Star Wars, this TIE looks like a TIE and the design is good. But the wings cannot do some movements and the center of this TIE is not very well builted. This is a mini sized set, so this features no minifigures. The building can be better, because the wings and the center are in a bad position, due to movements and it not looks like a TIE very much. Altough this is a promotional mini sized Star Wars, this TIE is not the best builted mini set. So, i rate this 4/5, because it have a nice color scheme and the design looks like good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Not too much besides an addition to a TIE Fighter collection; however, if there is one comment to make, even with 12 pieces, the fact the cockpit isn&#39;t centered between the wings is pretty frustrating.</p>
