"bmwlego","2007-11-09T20:16:27.03Z","Here Fishy Fishy Fishy!","This little creator fish looks cool. The color scheme works and this fish would look pretty cool in a fish tank. Has any one put a LEGO creation in a fish tank for a decoration I wonder? What would happen to the bricks?

The eyes are a great use of the small radar dishes and 1 x 1 studs. The tail and flippers move with the use of jointed parts. This is a cute set and would have been great as a part of a larger set so that you could build a school of fish!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-20T04:52:56.233Z","I've got TWO(or three) of these!","This is a cool set, with many orange, red, yellow, and green pieces! It even comes with instructions for the models!

Pros:

Looks cool
Nice assortment of colours
Instructions included

Cons:

You may need two of these sets for some of the inspiration models
Nothing else!

Overall, a cool set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
