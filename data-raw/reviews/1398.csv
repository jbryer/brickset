The engine reminds me of the old &quot;blue era&quot; trains when Lego first introduced us to train sets. It may have a few pieces out of place, but still OK.  The red caboose or passenger car is actually my favorite wagon (without the stickers). I like the large blue-tinted windows which actually shows the three seats within.  I like these windows better than the 2-stud wide windows like those on the green passenger car (10015). In addition, I like being able to take the roof off easily.  The other two cars, tipper wagon and brown luggage or cargo car are nice especially with a selection of cargo (2 brown crates, mail box, chain, and tools.  The designs of all the cars are simple (except for maybe the engine), yet effective and fun to build. PIECE SELECTION: (8) Not too many pieces of the same color but a nice assortment of standard pieces in various colors.  Having track and a transformer, don't need to pay extra for these in this set. ALTERNATE MODELS: (8) This set does give you a variety of pieces that you can build a few different cars with plus an alternate diesel engine with 2 extra window pieces. PRICE: (7) I paid $80 for this on E-Bay but I'm not sure what it sold for originally.  Probably around $50-$60 but doesn't include track and transformer. PLAYABILITY: (10) Definitely fun with combination of cars, accessories, and three nice figs.  Overall, I'm glad I bought this set. It's not a Super Chief but then again, it wasn't meant to be. It's a fun little set that works esp. well on a small loop of track.  Lastly, I added the red tipper car from the Cargo Train 4512.  It looks good with the other small cars.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-11-23T16:45:29.56Z","Only few bricks","If you buy this set, you will be negatively surprised. There aren't so many bricks with which you can build the locomotive and the waggons. The locomotive is not so detailed and the waggons are also fairly simple. You do not get tracks or a speed regulator, which is good. The price would have been higher if such things had been included. The locomotive has a motor, but no light. You get three minifigs with some tools, which is good. The locomotive would look better with a tender. Also the waggons are so small. So think about it if your really want to have it. It might still be a great collector's item but only when it's MISB. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The set I purchased was one of the last before&nbsp;<i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;took over my purchasing habits in 1999. The set was the Classic Train, the first steam engine released for the 9v system and the predecessor of the My Own Train system that would come to dominate the next few years.&nbsp;</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>Innovations:&nbsp;</b>The set was extremely basic but got all the major points. It could blend in with the Westerners theme almost seamlessly. There were few innovations, though. The train was blocky using simple hinges for the few features it did have. The caboose looked like a caboose, but it was an extremely simple build.<br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></b></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>Lack of Inspiration:&nbsp;</b>The simplicity of the build was its downfall. While it was briefly popular, it was surpassed by the My Own Trains and the Holiday Train sets of later years which all worked harder to make a better steam train. One of the failures of this set was its use of relatively short plates for train cars. All three of the cars were the same size and all were short, making for a fairly short train. The engine, too, was brick built to the letter and the ""round"" boiler is anything but. Even the roof of the engine cab is barely tall enough to support the engineer. The modicum of dark gray round 1x1 blocks used as rocks in the yellow car and the random items tossed in the flat bed were lazy additions to an already lazy set.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>What it Got Right:&nbsp;</b>The train is light, runs extremely well and fast on the 9v track, and looks like a steam engine. Those things are all important. The lightness of the train makes it portable and the lack of pieces makes it easier to repair since all train fans love crashing them. The speed is amazing. Only the engine cab of the Cargo Railway, without cars, can pass it. And most of all, the train looks like a steam train. Despite its many faults, it looks like exactly what it should and it harkens back to LEGO's earlier days with the 12v and earlier trains, but with much more realistic coloring.&nbsp;</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>Possible Improvements:&nbsp;</b>Besides the improvements already listed, this train lacked three extremely important things: tracks, an engine. and a speed regulator. I know some people prefer to buy their trains a-la-carte but in all honesty, no one likes to buy an engine for a 9v train. It was expensive then and is moreso now. I bought one with the set to save on shipping, but I didn't want to. I used the train on the same track (sometimes at the same time) as my Cargo Railway using the same speed regulator. Today I have enough tracks for large layouts and I have two regulators if I need them, but my engines are getting worn out and the wheels are losing traction. Back then, every cent counted and I could not afford to expand my train system to what I wanted. Other things this set may have improved on include using a better wheelbarrow design because this one stinks. The flatbed could have been longer and better detailed, perhaps with some stickers. Or, it could have been simpler with better things stored on it, such as brown plates as wood! Lots of wood!. The engine should have had the cattle grate but it wasn't invented yet. Still, there is no way to electrify the headlamps of the train and I feel this could have been corrected.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>Minifigures:&nbsp;</b>LEGO at this time was exceptionally lazy with its minifigures. Those included in this set are all available in other sets. The conductor is wearing the usual yellow uniform with a black hat and dark gray pants. The railroad worker is in the typical red vest over blue shirt with a white helmet. Both the conductor and the worker have the same face, a simple mustache pattern. The passenger was a bit more rare. He wears a white jacket with pockets that is zipped down a bit to show a green and blue striped shirt. Blue pants, blue legs, and black hair finish the gig. His face is a generic minifigure head with eyebrows. All-in-all, not a great collection of figures.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><b>How it Compares:&nbsp;</b>This set was the first in a long line of increasingly good-looking steam engines. As such, it was fairly generic, lacked detail, and lacked effort on the part of LEGO. If you can get it today, don't. Get the Emerald Night or the Holiday Train or even an assortment of My Own Train cars. They will probably make you happier. This set, though, still sits proudly on my dresser from time to time, enhancing my Westerners theme and reminding me of a time when it was the only steam engine on the block.</font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit""><br></font></div><div style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); line-height: 18px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px; font-family: Times; font-size: medium; ""><b><font class=""Apple-style-span"" face=""inherit"">FINAL QUALITY SCORE: 7/10</font></b></div>",TRUE,4,2,2,5,4
