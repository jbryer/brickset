I made the review, but i am making again, on this another version of the same set to keep a good rate. Many carts of old sets are from the castles, like the crossbow cart and some others. This is a cart from the ninja theme, have the function of a catapult, throwing two pieces. It isn't too heavy to a cart, if used to make a creation, can throw more pieces and be bigger. The soldier minifigure is cool, and it was easy to find when released. It also have the castle theme's wheels, in the same brown color. All the pieces are useful to some themes, the colors too, because this set have a good combination. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The catapult can be easily moved from one area of the battlefield to the other which I deeply praise. The minifig is there firing rocks at the enemy. This is a fine set and a must own for Ninja fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
