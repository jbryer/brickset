Obviously this isn't the most versatile set in anyone's collection, even for Fabuland. There's not a lot you can do with it but for some reason Ricky always looked kind of cool cruising around on his chunky scooter. Fairly pointless set, but at least it was hard for babies to choke on it (the only reason I can think of for the lack of pieces)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

When the set came up recently, I decided to review it. This is a nice set but the book says that Ricky Bear was the name but here it says Ricky Racoon. Decide for yourself on the name, but besdes that, this is really good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, now as an adult I'm looking at this set and think, that's not a whole lot of pieces. As a child I remember having fun with him. It was a great way to introduce children to LEGO, a simple set, that's not complicated and the more sets you got, the more versatile the play becomes. And depending on the age of the child, that may be all you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As much fun as my soon-to-be 4yr old has with my Legos and her Duplos, the simpler the design, the better. And she's content to take just the minifigures and a horse or motorcylce to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I think again, that this set is worth it for its sheer simplicity and likely too siimple for some.</p>
