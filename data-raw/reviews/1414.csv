 whole lot of pieces. As a child I remember having fun with him. It was a
 great way to introduce children to LEGO, a simple set, that's not 
complicated and the more sets you got, the more versatile the play 
becomes. And depending on the age of the child, that may be all you 
need.</p>

Duplos, the simpler the design, the better. And she's content to take 
just the minifigures and a horse or motorcylce to play with.</p></div><br>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,4
