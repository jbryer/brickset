Only the little dock thing drives me crazy.  The float plane is nice with the fork tail and the multi-engined plane. The cockpit and stuff is small and it is defanitely a small plane in all.  The pilot is very nice and I like his helmet!  The girl is some pedestrian who has gone out in a raft and has waited for her pilot boyfriend to arrive, this could get good! However, anyway, this is a nice set yet a rare one, you guys out there should get it to add another plane to your town.   (And dock and chick).
