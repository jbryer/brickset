Can you help him and get the job done by bringing in more DUPLO bricks? Contains 21 pieces and includes Scoop, 2 red DUPLO bricks, 3 yellow DUPLO bricks, Bird, a fence and a ""Caution: Bob at Work"" sign!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<p>Scoop is buildable.</p>
<p>Bird is printed on a single flat DUPLO brick.</p>
<p>The back digger works well.</p>
<p>Scoop is easy to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<p>The sign does fall apart quite easily.</p>
<p>You can lose the fence and is quite tricky to find.</p>
<p>I'm unsure about the WARNING light, though it does rotate very well.</p>
<p>My Dad drew a picture of how Scoop would look in DUPLO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I would reccomend this to all ages.</p>
