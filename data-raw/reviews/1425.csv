If you do, build the alternate models on the back of the instruction manuel. They are better. I personally never really did like DUPLO. I was playing with llittle LEGOS when I was young.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

My son has this set. Compared to the non-lego Bob the Builder toys this one can be put back together when it breaks (unlike his non-lego Scoop who now lives in the bin because he is broken).

- working crane
- happy/sad mouth
- Bob can drive from in the cabin
- great parts to add to duplo collection
- elements form one of the televised stories
