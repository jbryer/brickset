Great box although not for retail price (26 euro) but we bought it for just over 10 euro. Which is the right price for this box.Besides bob we have 4 windows and 14 bricks (with bricks printed on them). These bricks are great to have if you are building houses. They give a real feel of stone. For the 2+ aged children this set is to fragile but you shouldn't own just this Duplo box. So problem solved, just build something bigger. CAN WE MAKE IT, YES WE CAN.
My daughter just loves to open and close all those windows and since you can never have enough windows we bought another 3282 box(with a spare Bob). Only lesser point is the ladder, this doesn't fit anywhere. But even if you throw it out it is still a nice box. And for all those parents out there who &quot;NEVER&quot; play with Duplo, the bricks and windows are worth it",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
