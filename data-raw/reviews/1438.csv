According to&nbsp;the Bionicle story, Takutanuva was created by&nbsp;the two falling into a mercury pool that was filled by energized protodermis. No one, aside from the Toa Nuva, had ever survived energized protodermis before. The result was remarkable, light and darkness had united as one being! Of course using the instructions inside, you can split Takutanuva into two sets, Takanuva with his Ussanui, and Makuta so you can play for hours with no end!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
