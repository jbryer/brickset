Combined with Duplo bricks, this one could bring a variety of tall buildings and peculiar houses, as well as cars and even sort of a train.</p>

<p><strong>Bricks and Details</strong></p>

<p>The bricks in 330 are bright and colourful, just like most other sets of this theme. There are many bricks to create various houses, including details such as three red doors in yellow frames, as well as three windows of the same colour. Wonderful red fences could be used to make a garden (there are green plats and a pine-tree) or a balcony. The set also includes a white flag with Lego logo on it.</p>

<p>Archways can be used for architecture or to create funny animals or big characters with bricks, which have smiles and eyes.</p>

<p>The set includes 4 pairs of wheels, big and smaller ones, so you can make a car with these. 2 glass parts are also included, so you can make a cabin of plane, just like on the box.</p>

<p>There is no classic baseplate in this set, but a huge green 8x16&nbsp;plate, which I used both for buildings and trains.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The set comes with two characters&ndash; a boy (blue) and a girl (red). They have no arms or legs, but a movable yellow head with hair. They can be easily attached to any Lego brick. I am very glad, I have these two in my collection.</p>

<p><strong>Usefullness</strong></p>

<p>This set is no doubt a good toy for a kid, and is nice to train your imagination. Even as a grown up I see a lot of opportunities here. The blocks and details are perfect for later usage in creations combined with Classic Town sets.</p>
