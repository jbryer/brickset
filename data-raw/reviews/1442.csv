"jpeg68","2008-12-20T17:39:40.36Z","Part of a starter set.","I have this as part of a boxed starter set (a similar idea to the German 880002 but in one, big simple box). It is not sponsored, like some, by Shell but Merlin, a UK sticker trading company. It contains the bases, a 3303, 3306, five England players and five World players, plus some Merlin stickers. 
 What is interesting is that the set has no number apart from a red &quot;1&quot; in the top right corner. In fact, none of the sets inside have numbers (aside from the red ones) either. Thus it would be almost impossible to categorise the set unless you gave it an arbitrary number or called it simply, &quot;1&quot;? 
 I will submit a photo of it to Brickset and see how they cope with it. 
 A fun set, nevertheless, especially with all the other accessories added. In a final note, mine came with Scotland stickers but England players!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"toofpikk","2010-02-14T13:10:59.937Z","ok.","<p>this set ids really only ideal if you have lots and lots and lots of bricks or some lego football sets.&nbsp;me and my big brother got it as a christmas present from my dad, we built it (it had 2 stands, a commentary box with some police cars). we opened this first for we were really excited with long thin presents, then in the afternoon we didnt want it to be a football stadium anymore</p>
<p>it doesnt come with any figures or any spare peices, just 2 plane football boards.</p>
<p>if you are going to get this for a present to someone, unless they have lots of lego dont buy it, if they do, then watch the prices&nbsp; for if it goes over &pound;5 its not worth it but never go over &pound;10</p>

<p>thanks for reading</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,3

The finished stadium looks awesome and is a great addition to a larger town layout.&nbsp; Pictures of the stadium I built are at http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?m=mawich<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"Flash88","2012-12-24T19:06:40.133Z","The start of my LEGO football experience","<p>This set was the platform for many years of absolute enjoyment of LEGO Football from 1998 onwards for me.</p><p>Yes it's a basic set - literally just the pitch, but for me the box was something that attracted me as a kid. I actually wanted my stadium to look like the one on the box, and would save up all my pocket money to try and get enough to buy the grandstands to go around it.</p><p>While future sets made things quite restrictive, the basic-ness (for want of a better word!) of this set led to hours of imaginative fun.</p><p>I can still hear the sound of the ball running along the green bumps.</p><p>If you want something to build, this isn't it. But as a base for a collection and for something to aspire to (e.g. what's on the box) then great.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,5,4
