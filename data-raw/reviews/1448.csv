I have almost the whole stadium (except from some things I could easy made myself) including four of those sets. They are very detailed: many chairs, nice flags, interesting construction and two billboards with advertisements for companies like Philips and Shell. One set contains three figures. But if you have four sets like me, you also have four identical minifigures. That's quiet weird, so I created many figures myself. Great set, but only useful if you have the whole stadium.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The seats in this stand were fascinating and felt so realistic, considering what other lego was around at the time. Nowadays it's probably a basic piece, but back then it felt like a really special piece.<div><br></div><div>I always craved to have several of these, but only managed to get one. Only downside was knocking off the roof panels now and then when I played.</div><div><br></div><div>That said, it looks great, the seats are great. Would have been nice to get some more minifigs with it, and would also have loved to seen a bigger version of a grandstand. Instead, building custom grandstands was the way forward!</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
