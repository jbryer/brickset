There were of course stages, a commentary unit, light poles, a medical unit, and perhaps the most surprising of all: this riot police set!  No more problems with disobeing fans, who destroy the fences or walk on the field, as mr and mrs SPG strike back at the fans!  However, though riot police officers are known to have batons to hit, LEGO could of course not put this in their sets.  No problem though: bricklink can supply this without a problem.

I have none of the soccer sets, but I do have this one, as I think it's one of the most unique, unexpected sets LEGO ever released, and i like it a lot.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

We also get a few stickers which you have to put on. The trucks are very easy to build and very sturdy. I love the colors which LEGO has given to those veicles. The minifig value is also very good. We get a criminal with gray pants, a white bandanna, a black jacket and a black cap. On his face you can see a black beard as well and this minifig does look very evil as well. The other minifigs we get are the cops. One of the truck drivers has a black hat, black shades, a black and white uniform and gray pants. The other cops have the same uniform with the zippers and the white helmets. The first minifig has black shades and the other one is a female. Both figures come with a shield as well.<br><br>The trucks are the main attraction of this set. The truck for the prisoner is very simple: You can open the ceiling, the doors and the jail where the criminal can be captured. The other truck is longer than the prisoner van.&nbsp; The ceiling and the doors can be opened and on the front is a nice grill. The trunk on the back can be opened and you can put the police officers in there. On the back of the car you can also find a walkie-talkie and a red megaphone. Both vehicles are very cool but if I had to choose my favourite I would choose the longer one.<br><br><p><br></p><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
