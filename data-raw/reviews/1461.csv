<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Child-safe whistle!</li><li>Two Duplo suitcases!</li><li>Two clocks, blue plates,&nbsp;a train, and lots of other nice parts!</li><li>Yes, nice colours.</li><li>Includes track sensors for the engine!</li><li>Space for two&nbsp;Duplo&nbsp;people inside!</li><li>Two chairs!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Doesn't contain an engine.</li><li>Only two tracks!?</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>This set scored high, mainly because of the parts. There is also a paper background to show the station, cleverly attached by the 4 white bricks. At the bottom of the carriage there is some electronic equipment that never&nbsp;worked for me. The set also contains some track sensors. One should reverse the direction of the train. The other one has some ticket sign on it. Doesn't work with my train. The set only has two tracks. Two! I understand, the city one has 4. But still quite small.</p><p>The main problem with this set is that&nbsp;I&nbsp;have grown too old for it. However, when I was little, this was a great set for me, and I really liked it.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, if you are or you have a little child, this is a very good set. Try also getting the engine!</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,3
