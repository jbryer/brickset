Darth Maul is wicked with his double bladed lightsaber but if would have been really cool if Sidious came with lightning. This is the only minifg pack I got so I'm glad I got this one.

Altough this includes only few three minifigures, all are good designed and in a classic lego star wars style. All the three have black covers, characteristic of the sith as in the movie. Darth Maul is the better due to the detailed design on his face, a black cover and also the double lightsaber. Darth Vader is like other versions of the same, cool. The Vader's greatest feature is the head, that is basiccaly the helmet. Darth Sidious is also good designed but not includes a lightsaber, Darth Sidious uses a staff. This minifigure pack also includes three plates with a designed wall, to put the minifigures on exposition, or just play with them and increase star wars sets. Overall, it is so much good for Star Wars fans and also helps to increase your collection of the Lego Star Wars theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
