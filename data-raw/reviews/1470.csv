"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-03T14:34:40Z","A Good Addition","Even though all three of these figures are now in wide release, this particular set is hard to come by. Unless you just want an additional Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, or Boba Fett, there is not much play value in this set. But then again, it was meant for display. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-27T14:10:06.607Z","Another Star Wars minifigure pack","This set is a set of the Star Wars theme that is basically a three minifigure pack. This was released in 2000 and includes Han Solo, Luke Skywalker and Bobba Fett. All the three are simple but good designed. Luke and Solo have a yellow skin but it still good. Solo not have a weapon but the design makes it desnecessary, because some other versions of Solo in other sets have, this likes to be a se for increase. The Luke Skywalker have a black cover and a green awesome lightsaber. Bobba Fett have also a good design and simple details. The head, a helmet is also nice as the bag and the weapon, that isin a old style but still cool. This set also have some plates with cards to display the minifigures or just to increase other sets. I think that it is a good option for the Star Wars fans and Lego fans. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
