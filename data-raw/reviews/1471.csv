"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-15T12:04:55Z","Great Figz","        Thsi is a good set to get the precious biker scouts for  low price!  You get the one to many Chewbacca's out there but the biker scouts are always good! They come with the Blastech E-11 blaster rifles when lego should make a sniper rifle or blaster pistol with 'em but thats okay! I love the speeder bike sets like Ewok Attack or Speeder Bikes. If you get numerous sw sets out there, you will soon find that you have an army of speeder bikes, so thats cool! I would like this better if they replaced Chewy with a Han Solo or stormtrooper minifig or even an Imperial driver if lego could ever make one! 
Its an outstanding 9 because Chewy is in the wrong place here!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"brickbuster2409","2008-03-11T17:13:52.34Z","Terrific Display Set","two biker scouts (or scout troopers, whatever ya wanna call 'em) and an important lego figure, chewbacca.  what's better than that? (ok the sith lords and luke and co. displays might be better) but still great guys and collector's cards.  and they all come with weapons so you don't have to provide your own.  thank you lego!

Like the other, this includes three minifigures and plates with cards to display them. Chewbacca and two biker scouts are included un this. Chewbacca, like in other set, is detailed and looks like so much Lego, altough have a piece with his details to cover the minifigure. The crossbow of Chewbacca is the same of the knights in the castle theme, but have a black color. The two Scouts are the same and have good details, like in their helmets. The weapons included with  them are in a old style, but still cool and have orange pieces to looks like more a shooting weapon. Altough this set is little, it is a good option for Lego Star Wars fans searching for rare itens. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
