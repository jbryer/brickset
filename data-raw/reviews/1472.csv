WEll, I have said the same thing but I also understand that these minifig packs are all nice army builders! If you have enough money, you can get like 6 of these and have 18 battle droids and so on!  You get two battle droids with back packs, and a battle droid commander OOM-9 with the yellow art on it's chest piece.  I wish it had a battle droid security but oh well.  Nice set for low price.

"Gus_263","2008-03-27T14:24:19.78Z","Droids","Like other Star wars minifigure packs, this includes three minifigures and also cards and plates to display them. The three minifigures included in this are battle droids, that like other minifigures of battle droids, are not exactly lego minifigures, but are in the better building and design to looks like a battle droid in lego style. They are poseable like other lego minifigures, and these are also nicely detailed, like in the head or arms. Their weapons at first view looks like be in a wrong position, the side of the hand, but is the better location to the minifigure have a weapon. Like in the weapon of the troopers included in the Star Wars minifig pack #3, the droids' weapons are in a old style and with orange coloured pieces, to it looks like more a shooting weapon, and it really look like something with the weapons of the battle droids. Altough it is small and the battle droids minifigures are not much rare, these are good designed and this minifigure pack is good for Lego Star Wars fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The set comes with some stand but that's if you want to display it. If you want more droids, this is the way to go.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jack75","2008-11-23T12:49:51.717Z","A great set","I got about 4 or 5 of these of Bricklink about 3 or 4 years ago. I was really happy when I got these because it meant I could add to my MTT and AAT sets. It includes 3 droids, 2 troopers and a command officer. It includes 3 blasters and power packs for the droids.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alfred_the_buttler","2020-01-07T22:25:54.95Z","Get it for the bases","<p>I just got this set for free and it was complete. It definitely isn&#39;t a very exciting set, just three battle droids, two standard ones and a commander. As this is an older set, both arms hold weapons sideways, so if you want droids that can actually hold blasters, these are not the droids you&#39;re looking for. The blasters are also just megaphones with a translucent stud, so unless you plan on these droids attacking a Classic Space set, you&#39;ll want to upgrade the blasters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, what makes this set interesting are&nbsp;the bases that come with it. They feature 4 studs in the center of what is maybe a&nbsp;6x6&nbsp;sized stand. The bases can connect to each other horizontally on their sides&nbsp;via 4x4 plates that attach underneath and come with the set. The bases also feature a very nice engraved Star Wars logo in front of the studs and the ability to hold a card in the back. So you also get 3 cards, all different, that are sort of like baseball cards for each droid, although they are maybe half the size of baseball cards. The cards have rounded corners so you don&#39;t need to worry about them getting damaged in the box. They aren&#39;t anything too special, but are definitely unique for a Star Wars set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;This really isn&#39;t a set worth getting unless you want the stands for the minifigures. I don&#39;t have any of the 20th anniversary sets, but I would imagine that the stands in those sets for the throwback minifigures&nbsp;were probably based on these but using modern bricks.&nbsp;Definitely a very cool way to display a few minifigures.&nbsp;</p>
