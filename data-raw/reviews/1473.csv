There's almost no building involved in this set.  The figure itself is pretty standard and can be obtained from any of the bigger sets.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

The minifigure is great because not is only made with the body, legs, head and the hands, but have too a helmet with another piece on it and a gun and an armor. This became hard to find iten after it, and now it is rare, more expensive. It have too a plate, and more itens of collection. In the time that it was released, were more easy to have one... Still great now, as a classic, i rate this samurai minifigure 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
