"Novelty","2007-08-29T09:55:27.74Z","Two soldiers and a ninja","This is basically three minifigs, each of which is equipped with a sword and is placed on the stand.  It was a limited release of sorts and so is rather rare.  There's almost no building involved in this set.  The figures themselves are pretty standard and can be obtained from any of the bigger sets.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-26T15:48:14.89Z","Mini heroes collection, three ninja","This is another set without buildings, with minifigures. This includes two soldiers and a black ninja, easy to find in the time that was released, hard to find now. This have a sword on it's back on the image, the sword is a black katana. The another two are soldiers with another details, like the helmets, and too the designs and colors. Three black katanas are features on this pack of mini heroes. Also includes a plate to each minifigure, with a design of scenery, good for collectors. Now this set have a expensive cost and is hard to find minifigures like these, but still classic, i rate this little pack 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
