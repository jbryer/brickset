"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-13T00:00:00Z","","The only way to get green ninjas! Great, rarer than the white ones! I got one of this set, then traded a red ninja for a third green ninja one a friend had. How can you not give this a good rating? Green ninjas, masters of camouflage... One has the women's face shared witth the white ninja, and one has the male grey ninja face. And an extra samurai or daimyo, the rarer Dragon kind.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-29T09:57:43.05Z","Green Ninjas and a Lord","This is basically three minifigs with a sword on the stand.  It was a limited release of sorts and so is rather rare.  There's almost no building involved in this set.  Unlike the other 2 sets though, this is the only set with green ninjas and is the only way to obtain the green ninjas.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-26T15:59:56.81Z","Green Ninjas!","Like the another limited release, have hard to find minifigures, with equipments, and this have exclusive ones, the green ninjas, an awesome color for the ninja details. The katanas are in this set, with the soldier with white parts too. They have plates of collection, each with a scenery designed. The soldier have too a golden piece with the helmet, this can be finded in another sets of this theme. The green ninjas weren't very easy to find in the year that they were released, because were limited release. For now, is more expensive than previously, more hard to find too. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BobaFett2","2011-01-18T19:09:22.387Z","A great way to get a Samurai","<p>I got this set in 2000, and ended up losing not only the samurai's helmet, but also a ninja and two swords. Due to the miracle of Bricklink, I have more ninja and samurai. Sadly, both the arms and torso of the Samurai are cracked (this keeps happening to me! I have brand new minifigures whose hands/arms have never been removed yes have cracked arms).<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box has nice little scene displaying all the minifigures on the stands as well as the ninja and samurai in the center. At the bottom and top there's Mini Heroes Collection, and it lists the set number, age, and what pack number it is.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The three stands are quite interesting. They have Ninja on them right in front of the minifigure. They can be placed on other parts.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Awesome. The Samurai is really cool-his leg prints, torso prints, sword, and helmet are great. The ""horn-like thing"" is also very nice. The Ninjas are also good-but I prefer the Samurai.<br></p><h4>The completed model</h4><p>Three minifigures on stands, with information cards (all lost by now). Suitable for display.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The set was a nice little impulse at the time, along with the other minifigure collections. I found that the base makes for a nice statue base. This set is nice for the minifigures, probably one of the cheapest ways to get three Ninja minifigures.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4
