"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-30T11:58:49Z","Yay Chief!","As said before, this is the only set with Chief, the Rock Raiders captain. Unfortunately, the set is the same price as the other minifig packs, which have three figs in them. The other problem is that according to the Rock Raiders PC game, Cheif's helmet is chrome, but it's all good.
To summarize, a great set for collectors, RR fanatics, or people who just want a unique minifig.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"shima55","2007-12-31T20:01:43.92Z","A essential Rock Raiders set","This is the only set that contains the rare Chief figure, first seen in the Rock Raiders video game. For that alone, it is one of the best LEGO figure sets out there.

Includes display stand and display card
Stand connects to the other Rock Raiders figure sets

"Gus_263","2008-06-02T15:40:02.36Z","The Rock Raiders Chief","This set is a minifigure pack and includes a minifigure and a display. This was released in the year of 2000, the same year of releases of some other little minifigure packs, like in the theme city and in the castle theme (ninja subtheme). 

This minifigure isn't a classic at all, due to the details (no much compatible with the simple details of older classic minifigures), but is now, and also was (but not like now), a rarity. The minifigure isn't simple detailed like the old and some of the classic minifigures, but the &quot;Rock raiders Chief&quot; is well designed, and have the original shape of Lego minifigs. The color scheme is nice, and it increases the details. Also, this set includes to increase the minifigure, a helmet (with a translucent green visor), and a binocular.

The display is a gray plate, with a good size to the minifigure, and also to increase sets. The plate fit a card on the back to display an image on the back of the minifigure, no much useful, but still good.

Overall this set is really useful to any Lego set, and a great addition to the Rock Raiders fans. The playability of course is basic (it is just a minifigure with a display). If you find a set like this by the price of the new impulse sets, it can be a good option to get important Rock raiders stuff, but if you find it more cheap, will be better. Regarding as a small minifigure pack, this set gets a 4/5 of 5 for a rare and useful minifigure with a decent design. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-21T06:42:22.437Z","So much to say about 10 peices","Yes about only 10 parts, but this is a collector's dream, since the Rock Raiders Cheif never actually appeared in any sets. I managed to find one new on Bricklnk for about $3, a good price since the minifig alone is worth more! The background for the figure is cool, and the figure is an exact replica of the cheif in the game. If you like Rock Raiders, you have to get one of these. The 2x2 plate included allows you to attach the stand to another stand, plus the stand allows for some cool poses. This is by far a rare minifigure, and well worth at least $5 a peice, get one while they are still available.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
