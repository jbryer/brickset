Like some other packs with three minifigures released in the same year, this includes three displays, one to each minifigure.

The displays can be seen as unuseful pieces to illustrate something, but are useful plates with a good size, and without the card on the back, can be used to increase any set. The gray color scheme makes it more useful, because it was so common (and still in some themes) among the rock raiders theme.

Altough the display made it more expensive to a minifig pack, it is now a rare set, and have a great value, the three minifigures are different and so much useful. I don't know much about Rock Raiders, but the three miners included are well detailed, altough have the original shape, and have some pieces like the different shapes of helmets, pickaxes and an electric saw, much common in this theme.

The playability is basuc, at this point, this set gets a 4,5 of 5 in playability, are just minifigures, without any building, but still with some fun. More due to the useful pieces, this set can be undispensable any Rock raiders fans searching for minifigures. Regarding this set as a minifigure pack, I rate it a 4,7 out of 5. Nice altough small.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
