The pack also includes displays for the minifigures. Like on the packs from ninja, some minifigures are very hard to find now (and were when released). One of those who aren't easy to find is the minifigure above the other two, using a different type of helmet. The display is well made and is cool when with the minifigure because this can be showed easily. Altough this set have few minifigure to be an army builder, these three minifigures are very cool and useful to the rock raiders' sets, and also to city, they can be the citizens of a city or also miners, they are very cool and useful. It have too contents to make a lego environment, like the fire piece. Some tools consists in more than one piece, and the building of them are very creative. The playability is basically the playability of each minifigure, don't different because all the three have the same cool and original minifigure shape. This set can deserves a 4,7 of 5 in relation with the costs, aren't very army builders but have some useful contents, cool playability and are well designed and rare.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
