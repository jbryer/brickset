This set includes three different and well detailed minifigures. The policewoman is simple designed, and have the common Lego police colors, is increased with a helmet and a plate. Very useful, and it isn't very easy to find.

The doctor included isn't hard to find but still useful, this have a good color scheme, details (altough have the simple style of the early 2000's years, this is a good addition to any city, and is useful).

And the third minifigure is a firefighter, increased with the small axe and the helmet combined with the pack to don't burn or respirate much carbon. Useful, too, and shows nice color schemes, one of the best city minifigures.

At all, the minifigures are great additions to a small city collection, and even for a bigger. Really useful due to the color scheme, altough are simple detailed.

This set also have three displays, to display each minifigure. These are unnecessary, altough have more bricks (the part under the card of the display is made by blue bricks and plates, useful but not a decent addition).

The minifigures were very rare, and some still, but you can found some sold separately or with other sets by some sites like ebay. So, buy this set don't worth the money really, but found these minifigures, it is a great option. A 4,6 for the variety.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
