Each minifigure included is different, have some variations in the details, but all minifigure included features a common color scheme, with blue and orange schemes, and with some gray and black details. Itens (tools) like the shovel and thumper are included with the set to increase the minifigures, and also there are caps with black, gray and white color. The faces of the minifigures are variated, and have good, altough simple details, a basic Lego city stuff. 

The three displays included (three minifigures and three displays) are made by blue plates and bricks to support the &quot;card&quot;, with a blue picture on it's front. The display isn't much useful for play, but the part under it is useful to increase creations.

At all, this set is much basic, and don't worth the moey very well, but it was a easy way to get some variety and stuff of the city theme. Now it is rare, but the minifigures can be found in other sites, sold separately or together with another set. Overall, 4,6 for the variety and good minifigures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

They all come with a tool and useful if you're low on construction minifigures. The blue minifig stands are also rare today, which makes this set even better to have. 5 out of 5 for the minifigures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
