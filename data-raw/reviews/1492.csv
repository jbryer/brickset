The only way to tell what figure you got was to break the seal - hopefully you bought it first. They started at $6 Australian, but after a couple of months stores were letting trays of eggs go for a few dollars.

This set had one figure, one glass and one 'ice cream' piece.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-06-27T15:04:03.827Z","The chef","This set is a promotional released in the year of 2003, as a part of the World city theme (currently Lego City or just City theme). Released as a promotional in New Zealand, Australia and in some European countries, this set is very small, just a minifigure with some few additions, a cup and a chef's hat.

The minifigure isn't very great, but it is very rare, and is well detailed, with characteristic details in the body and face, this minifigure looks like to be useful to you city collection, as another citizen.

Overall, this set is very basic, without building involved, but is good for a promotional due to the rarity and of course, it is free (was). Currently, this minifigure can be found in many sites being sold with others, if you find by a decent price, and if you want to collect minifigures, this is a nice option to increase your minifigure collection.

But this minifigure does not have to go in Trains themes in can go with the Fire, Police, Airport, Traffic and more! This minifigure can go in any town themed set!</p>
<p>I have put 1 Brick for value for money because this set is a promotional release with Chupa Chips.</p>
