The only way to tell what figure you got was to break the seal - hopefully you bought it first. They started at $6 Australian, but after a couple of months stores were letting trays of eggs go for a few dollars.

This set had one figure and no other Lego pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

But this LEGO World City Construction Worker minifigure does not have to go with LEGO World City Trains. It can go with the 1990's LEGO&nbsp;System Trains theme, it can go with the 2003 LEGO World City Trains&nbsp;theme and it can also go with the 2005 onwards LEGO City Trains theme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I put&nbsp;1 Brick for Value For Money because this LEGO set is a promotional release with Chupa Chips!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
