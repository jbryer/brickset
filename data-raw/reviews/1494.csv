The only way to tell what figure you got was to break the seal - hopefully you bought it first. They started at $6 Australian, but after a couple of months stores were letting trays of eggs go for a few dollars.

This set had one figure, one white paddle and two clear green 1x1 round plates.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Despite all I have heard about it, this set turns out to be of very good use and it is always good to have extra train conductors for any city, especially in my Lego New York City model. I absolutely love the burgundy red cap and the navy blue trousers with the red tie that the conductor is wearing. The light flasher (or whatever) is useful. I recommend this set to anyone who is bored with plain old Legos!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Well now you have a Conductor, but you dont have a train.

How can a railway run well? -&nbsp;How can you have a proper train time table without a Train Conductor? - And if you do have a train time table; How can you make sure the trains come into the train stations ontime? Without a Train Conductor your LEGO train station cannot be a proper one. And&nbsp;this LEGO World City 3385 Train Conductor does not have to go in the LEGO&nbsp;World City Trains theme. It can&nbsp;go in 1990'S LEGO System Trains theme, the 2003 LEGO&nbsp;World City Trains theme and the 2005 onwards LEGO City Trains theme as well.</p>
<p>I have put 1 Brick for Value For Money because this set is a&nbsp;promtional release with Chupa Chips.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
