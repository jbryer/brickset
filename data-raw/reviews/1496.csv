The only way to tell what figure you got was to break the seal - hopefully you bought it first. They started at $6 Australian, but after a couple of months stores were letting trays of eggs go for a few dollars.

This set had one figure and no other pieces of Lego.

I don't know about other people's experiences but I found this figure to be very common. I may have to build a prison in my Lego town.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
