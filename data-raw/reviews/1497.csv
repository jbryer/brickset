The only way to tell what figure you got was to break the seal - hopefully you bought it first. They started at $6 Australian, but after a couple of months stores were letting trays of eggs go for a few dollars.

This set had one figure and no other pieces of Lego.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

It nonetheless made its way into my hands, and thus I shall review it. As it consists of one mediocre minifigure, this review will be brief.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really know much about the Island Xtreme&nbsp;Sports line, but this man seems to be some sort of holiday-goer. Perhaps he is an xtreme&nbsp;holiday-goer, but I can only guess at this based on the theme. His pose perhaps also suggests some level of extremity.</p>

<p>Our lovely holiday-goer is made up of four parts. His crewcut hair appears in around 30 sets, making it not too uncommon, but rare enough that it&#39;s nice to have. His head is nice enough, although limited in use. His torso is fairly ugly in my opinion, and as this is from the delightful age before LEGO figured out how to print swim trunks, he is wearing the signature thong seen so frequently in themes such as Paradisa.</p>

<p>He is no less playable than any other minifigure, I suppose, but he is still clearly nothing exciting. I have given him a 3 on value for money, as I suppose he would be a quite nice gift if you enjoy Chupa Cups (whatever those are), but would not be worth picking up Chupa Cups for if you did not otherwise enjoy them. Overall, our unidentified Xtreme&nbsp;beach dude holiday-goer gets a generous score of 2/5.</p>
