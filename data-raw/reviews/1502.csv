Has some (windows) to shoot the ball threw and practice your soccer skills. Was around $4.00 US retail when it was out. We do not have alot of soccer sets but for the price I couldn't pass this on up.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I could say the box is very boxy or, ooh! It looks a lot like two Legos doing a Neil Simon impression, but then I'd be lying.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-29T12:44:09.513Z","Ole!","This is one of the cheap soccer sets so I got it. It is a portable set much like the X-Pods and the goalpost doubles as the case. There is limited building in it. There is a soccer stadium turf plate with a spring-seat for the minifigs, three scoring targets with printed number pieces, a goalpost and two minifigs. Both the minifigs have wigs (blond, black) and one of the minifigs have a pair of pants with the words 'Adidas' printed on it which adds value to the set. Not very much worth buying in this set, nicest was the Adidas pants.

I remember playing with it with my dad when i was younger, and trying to play with it by myself and accidentally launching the minifigs trying to shoot! Cheap, fun, and great portability means buy this set if you ever get the chance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-22T10:06:57.123Z","LEGO Soccer","<p>Set #3401 Shoot 'n' Score: LEGO Sports introduced the world of LEGO to official sports games, Soccer in the US and Canada, Football to the rest of the world. Basketball and Hockey and a few other sports as well I believe. Many of the sets are meant to be used in conjunction with the large field sets and this set is no exception.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shoot 'n' Score features two Mini-Figures, it came in a plastic storage case with belt clip-on ability so you could carry it around with you and share it with all your friends on the school yard. The pieces in this set weren't many.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model that was actually built involved a score/goal training tool to shoot&nbsp;your Soccer balls at while the large plastic case could be used as a goal. The Soccer Ball pieces are actually realistic looking and were good for more than just playing Soccer. (Or Football if you prefer.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are fairly standard looking, they have unique torsos with printing on one side and stickers to go on the other for their team numbers. I mostly used them as additional citizens of LEGO Town/City.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though I'd have to say that Shoot 'n' Score is a set that is pretty useless for anything solid when it comes to builds. But as far as playability is concerned, well if you liked shooting the ball at the score training tool then you really liked this set. Most people probably bought them to have Soccer players in their LEGO Town and City Displays.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I should also mention at this point that the base plate used to make up the Soccer Field is included with this set, so if you wanted to expand your Soccer field then buying up some of these sets was a good source of finding the field plates. I however wasn't fortunate enough to be able to get the larger Sports sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this review was helpful to somebody. As I may have mentioned before I do not list pros and cons, but try to bring up the features of the set in as positive a light as I can. Some sets are easy to discuss, but others are a bit on the trickier side. I do appologize in advance if you don't think my reviews are of any use though.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,4
