Comes with a little camera too, and that's a neat piece.  The two minifigs and stand seats are again, another good addition to any soccer field.  Overall, nice small set of stands!  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-07-23T13:26:06.483Z","I own two of these!","I wanted to make a improved staduim for my Lego town. I picked a second one up because this is a very unique set. You get a stand with lights which is very cool, and two minifigures. If you like soccer or you just want to make a staduim, this is perfect.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T20:09:19.67Z","Another Addition","I got this for $10 and it has 59 pieces. It comes with two minifigures as well. It is worth your money. If you buy 2 of these sets than another section of your stadium is basiclly complete.It is about 1 foot tall so it is worth $10. Get this set for yourself. You'll be glad that you did.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-07T03:01:33.14Z","We got the seats to the game!","This spectator stand is quite accurate and is probably used for night games because of the stadium spotlights. The build is quite good, the seats are raised off the floor to give it a more realistic look and the overhead canopy gives it an even better look!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-17T10:31:31.42Z","LEGO Sports (Football) - Stand with Lights Review","This set looks very good in any LEGO soccer stadium. It's a nice and easy build and we also get one sticker which you need to put on. On the top of the ceiling you can see the big flood light which you can sviwel. This grandstand is very sturdy and I also can't complain much about the number of minifigs. We also get an extra soccer ball in this set. I think this model is very cool to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Flash88","2013-12-01T12:02:21.943Z","Nice item","I never really came across this set when a youngster, but have a couple that I've bought off eBay to go with my collection. It's a pretty simple set, and not a massive one for building fun. It's the sort of set that you'd want to get a couple of to make them worthwhile in your stadium. Nice little idea though, if you can't get hold of the separate floodlights.",FALSE,5,4,3,4,4
