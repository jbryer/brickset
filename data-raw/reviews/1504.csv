"A_Brickset_user","2003-05-30T00:00:00Z","","Definetly needs more minifigs, but hey, a fifteen U.S. dollar set (well, that's what I found mine for) doesn't normally have a lot of 'figs, so just fill the seats up with extra guys. (If you don't have a lot of extra town 'figs, just use something else.) Structure/piece wise. The common large gray C pieces are here, as well the ordinary five tall slanted rizer pieces. You would want your soccer/football stadium to look like the buildings match, so the little originality is okay.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T15:29:31Z","Good minifig soccer fans!","I really do like this set.  I bought quite a few of them, just for the additional minifigs.  They're good for any town theme, and they're good as soccer fans too.  I'm not too fond of the &quot;score card&quot; thingies that you can exchange (on the top), but I can see how they could be a fun way to keep track of your score when playing with a friend.  Overall, a really nice addition to a soccer field -- extra minifigs = extra fans!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The numbers to change score are useless, little pieces of card board you have to change anytime some scores. Goes real nice along side any of the bigger Soccer fields. A solid score of 4 for this set in my eyes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-24T16:33:17.84Z","Usefull","This set was $15 in the stores, so it was easy to pick up a few of these for a soccer stadium. It comes with 3 fans and a scoreboard. The set contains about 79 pieces and a 16 by 16 stud baseplate. Unfortunatly for some, this set comes with a sticker sheet. But, luckily it has only two stickers for the roofs. The scoreboard is quite handy and easy to assemble as well. You can punch out the cardboard scorecards and slip them in the stand. The set also comes with a Lego soccer ball. This set is worth the money and fun to play with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T12:03:52.25Z","Cool set.","I liked this set alot.  It had my very first girl minifig in it!  I got this at a local store, in 2007, for one cent!  They sell old Lego sets!  This is a really cool set!  I like how it comes with all of the extra pieces like the binoculars!  It is a really cool set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-17T10:26:22.82Z","LEGO Sports (Football) - Fans' Grandstand with Scoreboard Review","This set is a really neat and useful addition to any LEGO soccer stadium. It's a fun and easy build and we also get two stickers to worry about. What I like about this set is that scoreboard on the top of the grandstand. I don't remember it exactly but I think you get two small pieces of paper with the numbers 0-9 which you can use to show the results of the match. I also like the value for minifigs we get in this set. It's a great set to have and to add to any LEGO soccer stadium for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

The scorecard element is useful too, for people who maybe can't get hold of a separate scoreboard. I do prefer the other style of grandstand that was available, though!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
