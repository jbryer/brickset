The exterior of the bus is nice but the inside is not as great. If you want to make international teams, this is the way to do it. 5 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The roof has been given the best details they could but it looks abit cluttered. I have converted my friend's team bus into a RV and this bus is the one for the job! If you want a bus or an RV (convert it yourself as a MOC) I recommend you to get this one.
