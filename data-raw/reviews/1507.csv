The windows are also very decent, and it's great how they all slide out the back quite easily, without having to fiddle with picking them out of a roof.  

This set is pretty good, maybe worth buying multiples of in certain circumstances, but there's simply no &quot;wow&quot; factor to this or any amazing parts/figures. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-11T01:27:39.75Z","Worth Every Penny","I got my for relatively cheap too. Like 10 bucks. Just think of what you would pay for the bus, now add 6 MINIFIGS to it and 10 isn't bad. 

I too enjoyed getting all of the minifigs with a variety of faces and even hair color. The bus has a lot of fun building parts, like the windows and some tiles and the 2 windshields. Definitely worth it for the costs.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-07-02T21:26:46.153Z","great city bus","If you are making a town/city buy 1 or more of this bus. The bus can hold an impressive 6 minifigs including driver and the seats just slid out when its time for people to get on or off the torsos are blank and comes with stickers so you can change what country the team is for.it comes with a few balls too. all in all its a very good set get it if you see it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2007-08-06T19:40:31.27Z","OK Set","This is an OK set, I mean what can I say it's just some soccer plays and a bus.  The decal idea is good though (has many different teams!), along with the goalie, and the soccer ball. On a GOOD day I give this set 8/1o. Huh.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
