"Naylus","2009-07-04T18:42:42.42Z","The Football Team of Your Town","Oh, this is a nice little set. It has several minifigs with different faces, including the ones, that were introduced years ago in different themes (like Adventurers and Time Cruisers), and there are different hair colors (including the rare blond one). 

The bus itself is very simple: there are no doors, no seats, and the back panel falls apart if You pull it too hard. Stiil the bus itself is a very nice addition, that one can transform into a public transport of their Lego Town.

The Team is customizable, as You can use different stickers for the football players.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Remember my excitement at spotting in a shop, as I didn't recall having seen it in the UK.<div><br></div><div>It's a really nice item to put together, and looks great. The players sit on a bench that slides in and out of the back door of the bus, which goes up and down.</div><div><br></div><div>The players all have different expressions/hair, which is good. All the goalkeepers are green though. Would be nice if there was more variation between the team sets.</div><div><br></div><div>Stickers of numbers and logos are good too.</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
