"A_Brickset_user","2003-05-30T00:00:00Z","","This needs more spectators. The building, pieces, and included 'figs are good, but this set needs more minifigs. To prove how detailed this set is, look at the turnstylething, and the shop. (In case you can't see, the shop has two red hats, a tape recording tile, and a red flag.) There is an x-ray thing, that has two minifig leg bones and feet on it, one broken/cracked, the other fine. It comes into place over a players legs. More of the same type of bricks and colors from the other soccer/football sets, but this makes it look like your stadium fits together. 
Two random thoughts/questions. Does anybody think there should have been a small set with a referee, holding a 1x2 red tyle, and a yellow one, representing red and yellow cards? In the instruction booklet, there is a picture of a LEGO ref with a red one. Also, has anyone else ever made LEGO tops? (Probably yes.) I have about ten that spin from 35 to 55 seconds on average.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T15:39:51Z","A little junior, but still another nice addition","This set, I thought, was a little bit juniorish, but that's ok.  It does make a nice addition to a soccer field though.  I like the stands on the roof (aka nose bleed seats).  The cameraman can sure get some nice shots right over the field too.  The 'control tower' with the girl fig is a little lacking though.  Overall, another nice addition to a soccer field with a few more soccer fans.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-13T10:24:09Z","Strange","I bought this set this summer here in Norway. It costed 349 NOK. I don't like the set at all, but it contains a lot of useful parts. Actually I'm sitting right now with my set in my hands.

The minifigs: The minifigs are very good. Each one of them look cool and is useful in a chaotic town. I especially like the resQ guy. 8 of 10.

The box and instructions: The box's design is very strange and ugly. And the model itself is even more ugly... 3 of 10.

The model. As I've alrady said, the model is stupid. I wish TLC designed a better set than this. But it contains a lot of useful parts, like the crane, the THREE computer screens, the two train windows... But the crane does sometimes make the top of the house tip forward(stupid or what?), because the top is a loose part. Rating: 4 of 10.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-13T17:22:42Z","A normal town set in a gimmicky subtheme.","Plenty of unique pieces like the cherry-picker arm, computer consoles, and a transparent &quot;xray&quot; panel. Good to see the use of normal pieces and a design thats simple like a classic-town set. I'm thinking that someone from the old design school managed to sneak it into the crazy lego sports theme.

Still, not that good a value at full price. I found mine at walmart for 7 bucks.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T10:22:33.623Z","Just like the pros.","This fun set was a great addition to my lego soccer collection. It looks just like any ordinary broadcast booth but you cannot say your soccer collection is &quot;complete&quot; with this set. Although, the inside has nothing really but still I have to give this set a 5-star rating.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-07-05T20:31:21.897Z","Average set","This set would be really good if the design were better. But I'll talk about that later. Right now, let's review the pros.<br><br>To begin with, it comes with 5 minifigures, a soccer fan, security guard, doctor, camera man, and reporter. It also comes with a camera, cassette, flags, caps, car with stretcher, turnstile and a soccer ball, but if you bought many other soccer sets, I'm sure the ball included in this set is already mixed in with other balls from other sets.<br><br>Next comes the building itself. The left side of the building is a small shop that sells two team flags and caps. Right above the store is an area where fans can sit and watch the game. It has 4 chairs and the entire section can be removed. The right side of the building is the emergency room with a computer screen showing a fractured minifigure leg. You can place the stretcher in here to operate on the injured player. Situated right above the emergency room is the news room, where the reporter makes the commentaries for the game. This section is also removeable. A retracting boom extends out from the roof where the camera man can get the footage for the game. There are little areas behind the ""Shop"" and ""X-Ray"" signs where you can store the soccer balls.<br><br>My one and largest complaint is the design of the whole building. Aside from the news room which has a window, the shop and emergency room are exposed to the elements. Quite frankly, the only things that make up the building are the blue pillars. Even though this set is focussed on the soccer theme, LEGO should still have had put in some thought on the design of the building. <br><br>Overall, this is a decent set, the concept is good, but the design needs to be improved. If you don't have this set, you are not missing out on anything. After all, there are many other sets that are thousands of times better nowadays.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-09T04:48:50.39Z","LEGO Sports (Football) - Super Sports Coverage Review","This set is a very nice addition to your LEGO soccer stadium for sure. It has some nice grandstands and an entry with a gate which sviwels. We also get a tv studio where the commentator is, a crane where you can see the cameraman (which can sviwel full 360Â°) and a small vehicle with a stretcher.<br><br>It's a really cool set and it's fun to play with. It's also great for minifigs and the build is very easy as well. I can't complain much about this and as I told you in the beginning: This set is a very nice addition to your LEGO soccer stadium.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
