The way you control the players is awesome, and your hands hardly ever get in the way of the ball. I don't see why they made a second one, that is almost the same both in structure and name. (Championship Challenge II.) But now I think maybe I should get it, combine the two fields crisscross, and have a four way game with my three cousins. They are sometimes on the verge of wrestling eachother to see who will play, and whoever isn't playing has goalie practice with 3401. Anyway, this game is alot of fun. I recommend it for the original price, and any price under that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-02T05:27:16Z","the goal........","The whole set is really great! I like the way they kick and pass and block. But when I shoot the ball into the goal........ the ball always hits the net and gets back out! I think thats the reason why Lego made the new soccer sets with a different type of goal. But everything else is great!

I really enjoy this set for it's playability.  Now, I found it difficult to make any alternative models with the pieces in this set, but the original model is just fine enough.  Overall, a really neat big set with lots of mini-athletes -- hours of fun!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-21T20:50:36.123Z","Playability is off the charts!","Lego soccer was introduced in the year 2000. This was the first soccer stadium ever made, and it was by far a successful attempt for a first. Here's what I think.

Pros:

-5 players for each team (one team has white jerseys with vertical stripes and red sleeves, the other has green jerseys with vertical stripes) one goalie each team (with tessalating hexagons on their jerseys)
-Each player has the ability to pass, aim, and shoot with quite a bit of power
-Goalies can move side to side and shoot
-Advertisements for Adidas, Mindstorms, Lego Soccer, and www.lego.com
-4 ordinary soccer balls, one special blue Adidas ball
-Nets look really cool

Cons:

-Players are in fixed positions, can't move
-Goalies can't move up or down to block air shots
-Stickers can peel/become brittle. As a result, the set will become super plain without advertisements

Overall great fun set. If you missed your shot at this set, I'm sure you bought the later versions, which do include players that are able to move and goalies that move up and down.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ben_r_l","2009-11-29T21:22:04.7Z","LEGO scores a winner","This set boasts more playability than any other I've owned, Me and my family used to have tournaments every week testing our skills. Despite being stationary, it is not that easy to get the ball past the other team, too much or too little force and the ball will be bouncing off the walls or rolling towards your opponent! Moving the keeper to defend a shot is fun and with good enough reflexes the games can be long and interesting.

The shooting mechanism works very well and with proper skills, can look impressive!
This set is awesome and can provide many, many hours fun, the only downside is that the parts can not really be used for anything else, unless you have more imagination than me!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-08T10:07:31.187Z","LEGO Sports (Football) - Championship Challenge Review","This is the first and only LEGO soccer stadium I've got so far. It's fun to build and it also has a few stickers which you need to put on. What is a little bit weird is that you get 12 minifigs in this set. Actually there're 11 soccer players allowed to play on a soccer field for each team. All minifigs come with a catapult which makes it easier for you to launch the ball. It's a fun set to have and I really can't complain about this set. Even if you don't like soccer that much you should try to get this for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"HarleyMeenen","2018-04-20T16:23:20.717Z","A Great Set Across Ages","<p>This was one of the surprisingly few sets I had as a child, and it was hands down one of my favorites. I would spend hours meticulously building the field, and days playing with it. It holds just as much joy for me now.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m older, the build was much easier, and surprisingly simple, given how much I remember struggling with it. The part that stuck out to me was flipping the field over to add the supporting elements, and then back to keep moving forward- it always seemed to fall apart. No such trouble now, which leads me to think maybe my hands were just too small to really support it.</p>

<p>While it is pretty quick and easy, I&#39;m impressed with how well the build comes out. It&#39;s a very nice little field, and other sets let it be expanded and enhanced to give a real, rounded experience.</p>

<p>One of the obvious perks is the absolute playability of the set. It works very well- the players are on spring mounts, letting them &quot;kick&quot; the ball to each other, and the goalies can move back and forth and even dive to block the ball.</p>

<p>One downside is the lack of variety in the minifigures. Each team has the same six players and the same numbers. Three of these six&nbsp;have the generic &quot;smile&quot; face, and two are identical.</p>

<p>Overall, though the set is simple, it&#39;s good. The build isn&#39;t the best, but the end result is fun a delightful example of what Lego can do.</p>
