My memory has faded in parts in that I don&#39;t actually remember being given the set, but I remember years and years of enjoyment. The build is fairly easy compared to more modern sets. My instructions are long gone but I still remember how to build it without even having to bat an eyelid ! In my set most of the stickers are long gone too. The flowers on the front of the main large piece have survived the years, but the upstairs window box one has gone as are two that were inside which if my memory is good on that bit were a grandfather clock and a picture on the wall. Obviously as a child you don&#39;t think of the consequences of peeling them off !&nbsp;The furniture had to be built, unlike future fabuland sets that came with pre molded bits which was much better. There was a table and two chairs plus sofa downstairs, and another table and two chairs on the balcony which were sheltered by a large umbrella , but the was no furniture for the bedroom. The stairs just balanced by the side of the building and had a tendency to just fall over if I was playing on a living room carpet (which I usually was), the tree had the same problem. The two characters were Catherine Cat and Morty Mouse. A rather mismatched couple - were they actually a couple ? There is only one (furnitureless)&nbsp;bedroom, but plenty of space in the attic, which is where I remember Morty ending up a lot because he was &#39;naughty&#39; !</p>

<p>This was always my favourite &#39;main&#39; building. I used to frequently make it bigger by attaching Percy Pig&#39;s Garage next to it, and building more upstairs space with extra windows and doors from Lisa Lamb&#39;s Garden. As I gained more furniture pieces and little accessories over the years, the contents of this little house filled up.</p>

<p>35 years on I absolutely still LOVE this set. I&#39;m not sure whether modern kids would be that impressed, it seems very simple compared to what is out there today, but to my 6 year old self this was AMAZING and gave me years and years of joy.</p>

<p>I think everybody dreams of living in a cute cottage in the countryside....I think the one I dream of is bright primary colour yellow&nbsp;and has&nbsp;a wobbly staircase !</p>
