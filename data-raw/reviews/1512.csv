I added two to my &quot;championship challenge&quot; and they fit in flawlessly.  And hey, here's a set for some extra soccer players!  Overall, nice set as an addition, but definitely not a 'stand-alone' set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T11:49:27.31Z","Cool set!","I got this set in 2007 at a store that sells old Lego Sets!  It is awesome!  I wish I had the huge soccer set so that I could extend it!:(  Oh well, I like using the parts and it is good enough for it to be like a practice game!  It is cool! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I made posts and played a game with them.  The minifigures are also very good.  Overall it is so cool so get this expansion even without previously owning soccer sets.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
