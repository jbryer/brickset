The bus is pretty good but probably too big to fit on average lego road plates. I got the red one, but this one couldnt be much differant. The mini-figs are occasionally boring with the same suits but lots of good hair pieces, all cut though.
 I like the Johnny Thunder guy. The bus has room for a soccer ball up top but i just say forgettabout it. Its just too rattly. The buses sliding thing with all the minifigs is pretty neat, an engenious idea at the most. I recommned this set if you want a good inflatable soccer ball, a new LEGO soccer team, and an extra vehicle. Chow.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

There is nothing bad about this product in any way! I wold buy this set than the original 3405 because of the extra soccer ball and it is worth it! Great product, highly recommend!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
