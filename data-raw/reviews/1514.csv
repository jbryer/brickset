The green piece holding the soccer player tends to move to much and cannot stay in one place. It's accuracy is pretty off too. This is good set overall at a low price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-31T11:14:11.387Z","LEGO Sports (Football) - Point Shooting Review","This set is one of the smallest LEGO Sports (Football) sets I have now. It almost doesn't have any play features but it's still a good little set to have. The only play feature we get here is the catapult which shoots the ball in one of the 3 holes. The built is very nice and easy and it's also a great little set for pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own creations).<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set

Don't see how you can't replicate this simply by practising in the goal.</div><div><br></div><div>Might be a good travel piece if you are going anywhere, but certainly not something you'd play if you had alternatives.</div>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3
