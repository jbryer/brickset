But I love to play soccer with my friends. So, when Lego came up with this line, I was really interested.<br><br>I want to buy the Championship (set 3420), but I still didnt know could the set give me a lot of fun, so I decided to buy the smaller set first, just to try how much fun can I get. Turned out that it was really fun. Great idea for making the minifig playing soccer.<br><br>I love how you can aim the minifig and kick the ball into any direction I want. Fun fun fun. And it's only using one minifig. I spent a lot of my alone time to play with this set. Just for having fun and killing time. Also, this set has an advantage compared with other bigger soccer sets. This set only takes a little space so you can put it in your work table and play with it anytime you have some spare time. <br><br>If you are not a soccer fans, do not worry. As long as you can enjoy playing something, you must have this set in your desk.<br>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5
