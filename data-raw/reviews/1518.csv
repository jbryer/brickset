<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a Soccer LEGO Sports set this is one of the better sets offered by LEGO, not simply because it features a full team of players, but because it allowed you to get some diverse teams for your LEGO Soccer collection. This one being an all woman's team was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like most of these sets however there wasn't much to be built in this set. Aside from the Mini-Figures and the Soccer Balls included with this set you also had...&nbsp;Three small cones (not sure what they are used for.),&nbsp;a goal kicking testing device with pieces to indicate points, a small black and green thing where the Soccer balls could be stored so they wouldn't roll away from you and if memory serves that's about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though I'd have to say that this set is a good set to pick up if you're interested in Female Mini-Figures. For LEGO Soccer fans of course this set is definitely worth picking up, the more teams you have the better off your displays can be. Stickers were used to give them all team numbers of course, even the couch had a number applied to her back... hence why I thought she was meant to be the goalie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You were also given a spare blonde wig with ponytail to replace the black hat the coach wears, a little bonus like that goes a long way to make a set good.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,4
