"mrmitch","2007-08-03T14:37:11.473Z","Unique wide two person wall piece","Set is simple but has alittle character. Only recent set I know of with the two guys printed on a wide wall piece. Object is to score a goal and try to hit the two targets near the top of the net. Came in a value pack otherwise wouldn't be in our collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-25T16:38:13.183Z","Interesting target practice","This came in value pack along with 3418, and unlike 3418, this one is more interesting. The point of this game is to hit the target with the 2 goalies in the way, although they're really a sticker in a 1x6x5 wall brick. Without a doubt, this means you'll have to kick the ball as high as possible, because the wall is quite high and the target is quite far off the ground, but don't kick it over the target, and if you hit the wall, the ball might bounce back and hit you, so kick wisely...

Pros:

-Interesting concept and objective
-Target rotates
-Wall has 2 ""goalies"" and is movable in any direction you want
-Comes with player, field section and soccer ball
-Field section is also movable at you liking

Cons:

-None, but some people might bet bored after a while

If you do get bored, I suggest you set up new challenges for yourself, like trying to hit the target with the wall moving side to side or forward and backward, or something similar. Overall great target practice and possibilities are endless in terms of the challenges you can create.
