The game itself can be fun but you need two people with quick reflexs to really get a game going. Easy to build, pleanty of mini figs. and when I came across it I got it for 60% off which to me was a selling point.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legojoe6678","2009-12-09T18:11:21.577Z","GREAT!","I have this set and its awesome! 

  Pros- EVERYTHING.

 Cons- The spring will wear off
           and kick weakly, but it
           wears off in two years so
           its still good.

       I recommend this set to ANY sports
         and soccer fans. It's simply. Amazing! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
