The flaming soccer ball is nice and so are the goalies' abilities to move up, down, and side to side. Includes 2 nets, spring action platforms for kicking the ball, side boards with advertisements, and 2 VERY useful 8x16 bricks that are a great start to building large skyscrapers. Overall so-so set and forgot what the price was.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
