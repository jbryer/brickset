Set includes kicker, goalie, ball dispencer, oversized hands to help block shots (hands come in big and small sizes, 2 each), MOTOR!, 2 platforms with spring action and long 2x16 green plate to connect these platforms. Not to mention 3 soccer balls. Both the motor and ball dispenser work really well, no flaws. When motor is cranked to the fullest, the goalie will move side to side really fast, gradually moving slower as the motor runs out. No problem because it is the kind of motor that never runs out unlike batteries. Overall great set, forgot the price, and don't know why I threw this enjoyable set out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
