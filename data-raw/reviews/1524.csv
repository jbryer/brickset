This set also comes with a few stickers to worry about but everything else is great. The catapult where you can put the soccer player does shoot and the ball is supposed to fly through the black walls with the holes. The goal keeper is on a base plate which you can sviwel. It's a great set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
