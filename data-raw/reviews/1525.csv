P.S. You should call it soccer, not football.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-14T00:01:07.827Z","He Shoots, He Scores","This is the only Soccer i mean Football set i have and once again I think I got this one to say I had a Football set. Still not disappointed that I did. He goals are quite cool with a five and ten point targets that fall when hit and a 25 point target that flies around when hit. Goal frame is quite solid and has a little red flag up top. LEGO really tried with this one as you can see by putting up a small barricade behind the goal to stop the balls flying off. Sort of works but still good idea. The thing that annoys me most about this model is the stickers. Ok its good we have Adidas logo on it but Why not just print it on and targets.

The goalie is nice too in white pants red shirt and the number 18 printed on both sides of his shirt. one of the first models to have that if I remember correctly. He is standing on a Football plate on the launcher.

Overall it's a cute little set that offers some fun times if you like knocking things off or Football. I feel its quite realistic for a LEGO model and deserves a 7/10. It's Aesthetically pleasing, has good playability and makes a cool display model. I would recommend any LEGO fan to get this as it makes a great addition to any collection

"Legonater","2007-09-19T21:32:17.373Z","First set","My sister got this for her birthday. I love it, and she has already gevin me all her lego. This is a cute starter, and even better onnce3 you get a lego field. This make good training practice. I like the Adias Logo. I think the player is a nice addition if you don't have any other players. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-25T16:10:03.373Z","Fun little set","If you want a small soccer set that's easy to carry around, look no further than 3424. It's fun and it will improve your accuracy. 

Pros:

-Three targets. The one on the left is worth 10 points, right one worth 5, and centre worth 25
-Left and right targets collapse when hit, center target will rotate slightly
-Adidas adverstisement behind targets
-Player, field section, and soccer ball included
-You decide how far away the player is from the targets, there aren't any restrictions

Cons:

-Flag makes set look tacky and it's unnecessary

Overall great small set and perfect for starters.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Z_wing","2009-07-28T06:05:47.48Z","almost a perfect set","by looking at the cons list you can see that there are none. the only problem is that it is not great by itself. I do not have any other football sets but I think that this set would be alot better with other football sets. also the one sticker might be a con to sticker haters but I do not mind stickers

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building up the titular Target Practice device was simple and took very little time, when it was done though you had something you could interact with, with the Mini-Figure and you could even swap out the Mini-Figure for any of your other Mini-Figures from other Themes to have some interesting display options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set also included one of the Field Base plates. (I call them plates because they aren't really meant to be bricks.) This set I don't think came with stickers though because the Mini-Figure already had a number on his chest, but I could be wrong about that, these sets are some of the more easily forgettable ones from the Purge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this was a useful set to build up some Soccer Mini-Figure collections cheaply as opposed to buying the larger fields, and it is a nice companion piece to any Soccer/Football display because the numerous Teams do need to keep in good shape for training during the off-season. But unless you particularly love LEGO Sports then there's really little point to pick up these sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not every Theme is for everybody, but some people somewhere will enjoy certain Themes and if you have a LEGO Sports enthusiast in your family than this set is definitely for them.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,4
