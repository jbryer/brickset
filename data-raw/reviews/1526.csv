I never bothered duilding the outside but it was still really fun to play with and the passing system works well. Also 22 minifigures in one set is pretty awesome.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-11-01T11:51:50.81Z","Great soccer set","While not as great as some of the newer soccer sets, this one is still a lot of fun. You have the springy players, which hold the ball quite well. It's a blast to play, but the ball occasionally gets stops rolling and you have to pick it up. But other than that it's a nice set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
