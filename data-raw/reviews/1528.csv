It really has that feeling like you're in the city, playing in a park or alley. The set itself is poorly designed with the colored grey and red plank that sticks out so you can make slam-dunks. You have to pick up the whole post up to bring up the mini-fig. The only part that doesn't make this a one star set is the black gate and skateboard that build up the character of this set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"thepeopleperson","2008-07-05T16:35:30.31Z","Not too great...","This was the first basketball set I got, and I guess it was fun for a little while before I got the others. m Here are pros and cons.

Pros:
Comes with backboard and hoop
Skateboard
Comes with extra basketballs
Dunking catapult thing works well
catapult can move so you can dunk from different angles

Cons:
Why would there be an &quot;NBA&quot; minifig playing in thos alley thing?
Basket will fall off of backboard after so many dunks
Has to stand by itself-can't be added to other basketball sets

This is an OK set, but if you skip it, you won't miss out on much.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Pro 1 It works</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pro 2 The minifigure can shoot hoops standing on the ground</p>

<li>Pro 3 The set contains a handful of mechanical pieces</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Con 1 The backboard has designs on it so it might be hard to use the piece for something else. 
<li>Con 2 The minifigure looks strange.</li></ul>
<p>Overall a good set but I wouldn't pay more than $15 for it.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,5,4
"KX","2017-02-28T13:19:10.127Z","Ballin' (But not that much)","<p>I remember getting this set as a birthday gift.&nbsp; What intrigued me the most is the minifigure. It was quite new to me because it had springs on its legs to &quot;help&quot; it shoot the ball.&nbsp; The set itself was not that exciting.&nbsp; The only thing that made me happy back then was: (1) I got a basketball inspired set. (2) It has a skateboard piece and (3) Well, since it was a gift, I didn&#39;t spend any money.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>For children, parts were a bit bland.&nbsp; But if you plan to make a streetball inspired MOC, the hoop and backboard helps.&nbsp; Other pieces, not that much.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building&nbsp; Experience</p>

<p>It was fun. But once your done, it feels kinda bland looking at it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>Depending on how strong you press the &quot;dunking feature&quot;, the ball is always sure to go in.&nbsp; Making shots via flicking the minifig (to simulate the jumpshot) is a bit tricky.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyways, if you are a fan of old school Lego and NBA, this set is good.&nbsp; But other than that, sad to say, you can just ignore this set.</p>
