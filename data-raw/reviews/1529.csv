"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-19T21:14:12Z","uhhh...","I can't say that this is a good set. Let’s try my new way of reviewing again.

The Good Going LEGO!
It's got a clear back board.
It’s got some 1 X 2 axle bricks.
Some balls.
A nice big red plate.

The NNNNOOOOOOOOOOO!

The base for the player is slippery.
The ground would probably break easily.
The guy with the big hair is hard to control (he also hurts the fingers).

The Fact
The building instructions contain a 7 page comic featuring 3428,3427,3429,3430 and 3431. But the The Ultimate NBA Arena has a comic but it only 2 pages and only features 3428. Weird.

The building tip
if you have two of those clear back boards and have a couple of those hinges like the ones that hold the wings of the plane up in 5935 then you could build a clear extra strong safety door that could hold anything from gems to prisoners, to little bits of silver foil.

See you next time.

LEGO people fold it up to put it in the package and unfortunatly it stays bended, not flat. The set also only includes 37 pieces and 2 minifigures. The basketball hoop is great. I like the clear backboard that LEGO made. The minifigures have special springs inside of the legs. Not a bad set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The hoop is always cool in the sports sets but there should be another tan surface piece, then it will be a 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-11-19T16:21:06.78Z","Uhm...","I like Lego sports, so I grabbed this one as soon as it came out. However, I can't say it was that good. While the court was huge, the 2 figures just don't...work that well, and it's hard to play. It costs $20, which is too much, so unless you can find it really cheap, you shouldn't get it.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
