pros
-wind up motor
-basket bal shooting mini figures
-the jumping mini figure stays up right when he jumps
-nice net and back-board
-to my suprise the basket ball shooter actualy woorks=)

cons
-the jumping &quot;aparatice&quot; is a bit bulky and could be slimmed down
-when he jumps and comes down, it jerks a bit
