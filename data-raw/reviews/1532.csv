"EL_Mo","2008-01-24T18:21:46.107Z","Useless","This set I got for $3 at a Goodwill. It is not a good set at all. The minifigures are useless because of their legs and hands. And it is almost impossible to make a basket the way it is designed. Although there are a few decent pieces in the set, I would only recommend this set to a serious sports junkie.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-30T19:50:12.793Z","Why Bad?","This is a set that is unique in many ways. Lego made its first street ball court and they did it right. You get two hoops, 3 basketballs, 4 minifigs that shoot, and the court itself. There is nothing wrong with this and deserves a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-24T14:34:30.233Z","So Good...","I got this set for my eighth birthday. When I opened the set, I stared in awe at the minifigures, they were a whole new design never seen or used before.

Pros:

-4 awesome players that can pick up, grab, and shoot
-Basketball net looks really cool, the backboard is a 1x6x5 pre-printed brick with a little NBA logo on the bottom left corner!
-Ends of the court are slightly banked to keep the ball in
-Fence keeps ball from going out of bounds
-Court entrance
-There's also a bench, not much use out of it though
-Comes with three basketballs

Cons:

-none

If you use the right amount of power and aim accurately, you can actually pass the ball right into the other player's hand! I also notice after many times of play, the springs in the players' legs will get stronger! Overall great set and if you see it you have to buy it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
