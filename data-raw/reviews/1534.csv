The game is a bit hard but you can fit at least 38 or more fans on the bleachers at a time. With super modeling, there is no ragging to this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Although some of the players are on different teams or have different numbers like Kobe Bryant, there are great minifigures in this set and it is a great set to pick up.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"alva","2011-03-29T20:59:50.22Z","A Lego set that can do more than a display","I always want to own at least one set from the Basketball line, and after searching for a couple of years, a friend of mine offered me this set, and I bought it instantly.<br><br>The building proccess is quite fun. I really love that the set own two clusters of seating for the viewer, each on the side of the courts. It took me around 40 minutes to finish the building of this set.<br><br>What I like about the set :<br>1. You get a lot of famous NBA players in minifig : Shaq O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, Allen Iverson, etc<br>2. You can play with this set, playing a real basketball game. I think Lego can really go a long way with this kind of playing, not like the new board game series that too complicated and not clear.<br><br>What I don't like about the set :<br>1. I think the size of the court is way too big. Comparing it with the size of a modular house, the set length and width are really too big, making the set looks akward if you put it in the city complex.<br>2. The minifigs hand occasionally hold the ball to tight, so when you try to do a shot or a pass, there's a chance that the player won't throw the ball.<br>3. There's no guide book or instruction about how to play, only some vague explanation on the back side of the box.<br><br>In the end, I think this is among the best set of basketball and among the best set that can be played that Lego ever launched.<br><br>For you City builder with your own city, this basketball court is a must. It will add the reality feeling for your city, cause your city won't be just houses standing together but also own a basketball court as well. Combining it with some sets of soccer/football, add some swimming pool, and you get yourself a sport center for your city.<br><br><br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<ul>
<li>Some good parts, like clear backboards, and large blue half pipe pieces. 
</li><li>Great playability, and I'm not gonna lie, pretty fun too. 
</li><li>The stadium is huge.</li></ul>
<h4>The Bad:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Dificult to tell what team the figures are on, since they are all different colors. 
</li><li>Build is a tad repetative, a tad repetative. With stikers, with stikers. 
</li><li>Price is about $20 to high.</li></ul>
<h4>The Verdict:</h4>
<p>I'm not a huge fan of basketball, but I happened to get this on sale for $20. It was a bit larger than I expected. The build was fairly unexciting. The set could use some fans. It has great playability and some detailed figures.</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,3
