The kit itself is fairly simple: the restaurant, a small outdoors area with a table and sign, and a car. Still, this kit has some neat little details, and looks really good overall.

First of all, there’s the sign with a drive through label and a menu. Hm, seems that lego McD’s only has burgers and fries as options! Oh well. Once the customer comes up to the restaurant, he can order via the open window with a small counter. Inside, there’s a cash register with mustard and ketchup dispensers, but nothing more. I wonder how the worker cooks the food? 

Okay, so the interior is plain, but the outside is cool, with the flags and signs and the curved roof. The car is small but nice, although it seems a little go-cart sized. For accessories, you get a dollar bill and tray with drinks. What? No burgers and fries? Yes, I’m afraid so, but today you can easily make burgers with tan and brown 1x1 round plates. 
 
The parts selection is okay (those red train windows are hard to find), but nothing really special. And the two minifigures are okay; the worker would have been great, except that his torso is a STICKER! Oh well.

So, overall, this kit may have its flaws, but if you can get it cheap it’s a pretty decent set, and a good addition to any town. 7/10

P.S. Who else thinks TLC should make a new McD’s for the modern City theme? That would really rock. ;)

"AETerry","2010-09-12T23:04:17.21Z","LEGO Fast-Food!","<p>This set comes from a ""dry spell"" year for me as far as buying LEGO goes.
 There weren't that many sets out that year I wanted or was impressed with getting. This is
 one of the few sets I did pick up that year. <br></p><p>While I don't personally care for McDonalds, the fact that this set 
is a restaurant and offers up more places of buisness for a LEGO Town is
 great. It was a good price, small and simple. So what there is great 
with the customer driving up, a place to eat and the drive through 
window. It's got a certain undeniable charm that makes it worth picking up if you can still do so.</p><p>
</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in booklet form following LEGO's clear step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 98 pieces for this set, many of which are red and yellow for McDonald's characteristic coloring. Other notable pieces are the printed sign for the menu and stickers for the McDonald's symbols &amp; signs.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There's only two minifigures in this set, one of whom is a customer and the other being a McDonald's employee. The customer is fairly standard, though I feel as if the Employee could have been a little better conceived of.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>At $10 for the set, you are expecting a small set, though somehow I feel if for $5 or $10 more, if this could have been just a bit larger.</p><p>The main restaurant itself just feels way too small with only allowing one employee inside and no inside seating. The details for the register and work station are decently done for it's day and age with available elements.</p><p>The outside makes up for it a bit with the menu and the customer driving up in his car to order. Plus it's outside that you have any sort of place to sit and eat with an umbrella to shield diners from the weather.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>While I dislike the notion of commercialism with my LEGO or other toys to push sales. Familiar names and brands can and do add an air of realism, particularly with a LEGO Town/City layout. And this being a fast food place and restaurant, the set (for those who can get a hold of one or still have them) adds more places of business that minifigures can go visit and things to do.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
"The_Mimed_One","2011-06-21T23:52:27.357Z","Really just the stickers...","I have just bought this set (MISB) here in 2011. It is a great cute set, had I had this as a child, I would have loved it, but I dare not open it today.<br><br>This is because I spent $75 on it--a bargain for this rare collector set. Really I just bought some stickers though! In all honesty, the parts would be maybe $10 used. I wanted this set MISB, but<br>I want a used one.<br><br>These restaurant sets are rare, and this one even more so because it is co-branded. It is a showcase set from the 1990's. The car is iconic, the cute little setting is awesome, and I feel sad that this set costs more than $75 on average.<br><br>Cheers to LEGO, and thanks for making this set!<br>",TRUE,5,2,3,5,2
