"Lego_Lord_Mayorca","2011-11-19T16:07:34.173Z","A Surprisingly Entertaining Set!","Back in Fall of 2000, Lego S@H did a small promotion where if you ordered anything above $99 (or some amount of money like that), you would get a free set. In this case, it was 3439 Spy Runner. When I received my birthday gift that year, the huge UCS TIE Interceptor, the little spy plane and ground car seemed hardly exciting, and I assumed I was going to be building it as a matter of principle to my then-12 year old self. In fact, I think I built it first just so I could quickly get it out of the way before embarking on the construction odyssey of the TIE Interceptor.<br><br><h4>Box and Other Superficialities</h4><br>The box is small, comparable, if not exactly, the same dimensions of the ""Jedi Defense I &amp; II"" sets of 2002. Inside, everything came in one bag, save the wing and canopy pieces. There was a small instruction manual, but other than that, nothing particularly noteworthy about this set's packaging and presentation.<br><br><h4>Parts, Building, and the Final Model</h4><br>If you've ever built any kind of Lego plane from the late 90s, the build will seem quite routine. I suppose that was a good thing, considering how hasty I was on my birthday to get to crack open that UCS TIE Interceptor. The addition of the air traffic control car was a bonus, and I love the slick tires (always have, probably always will). The pilot minifigure has a cool flight suit design which was new to me at the time, whereas the driver of the control car was of the more generic service-station-worker variety. <br><p><br></p><p>The plane had some very nice ""Space"" pieces, including the canopy and booster rockets on the wing tips. Be aware that 2000 was the middle of huge slump for me in terms of collecting. I only collected Star Wars, and even that was showing signs of losing my interest (not to mention my parents' burgeoning hope that I was very soon going to grow out of Lego). Therefore, my appreciation of the parts in the plane that I associated with only Space or Star Wars before was quite a mark in the set's favor. Another big plus was how solid the little thing was. The color scheme was not so hot; ideally, I would've liked the wings to be black, but it's not such a big deal now.</p><p><br></p><p>Aside from the opening canopy, the propellers spin and the wheels on the plane and car roll. Whoopdy-doo. So I left the completed set to go off and build my TIE Interceptor.</p><p><br></p><h4>The REAL Fun is in the Playability...</h4><p><br></p><p>Long after my TIE Interceptor was collecting dust like a good display model should, I was running back and forth between my room and my sister's, holding the Spy Runner aloft as it prepared to dive bomb some unsuspecting Barbie villages. Other times, I spun around my room with it as it did reconnaissance missions for my Lego government. But most of the time, it was blasting enemies into oblivion from the air. More so than other iconic Lego flying craft that I owned, like 1999's incarnation of the X-Wing Fighter or 1997's Alien Avenger (from the U.F.O. theme), I took this Spy Runner constantly on my flights of fancy. In retrospect, it got such heavy play because unlike the X-Wing or Alien Avenger, it was small, easy to pick up quickly, and sturdy as heck. It is generic-looking enough to be more than just what the name on the box says it is. That's why in spite of the mediocre build and parts selection, I rate this set very highly. It was a surprisingly wonderful addition to my Lego collection, a breath of fresh air in a stagnant period in my Lego collecting pre-teen years. <br></p><br>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"Taggerung1","2021-01-15T07:54:46.22Z","A Forgotten Legend","<p>I first got into Lego just before this set came out, so it was one of my earlier ones.&nbsp; I started really taking an interest in 1998, but my parents couldn&#39;t afford to buy much for me, so I missed out on a lot of the cool themes of the time.&nbsp; Late &#39;90s remains among my favourite eras for Lego.&nbsp; But even when (naturally) Star wars became the biggest deal ever, my first issue of the Lego Catalogue featured three different airplanes, and as a young lad with dreams of a Lego city, I wanted all three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was ultimately able to convince my parents to buy me two of them, including <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1817-1/Sea-Plane-with-Hut-and-Boat"">1817 Sea Plane with Hut and Boat</a> and of course, Spy Runner.&nbsp; Never did acquire <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1808-1/Light-Aircraft-and-Ground-Support"">1808 Light Aircraft and Ground Support</a> and I&#39;m still sad about that, 20 years later.</p>

<p>In any case, even though I focused my collection on A: Star wars, and B: whatever I could afford, those two little airplanes were always there, parked next to the X-wing and TIE Fighter.&nbsp; A little modification and imagination, and wing tip fuel tanks become rocket launchers, and engine exhaust pipes become machine guns.&nbsp; Spy Runner became a nimble dogfighter.</p>

<p>I liked that the construction was consistent with the Sea Plane, even though the pieces were newer and cooler.&nbsp; Unfortunately that last point is what lead to its downfall.&nbsp; I went through a period of taking apart most of my sets to build my own things, that I&#39;m still recovering from.&nbsp; (RIP, Mos Espa Podrace)&nbsp; So for a long time, I was without the Spy Runner.</p>

<p>Then one day I remembered her, and realized the injustice that Sea Plane had survived, but not Spy Runner.&nbsp; So I took the effort and found/freed all the parts, and gave her a place of distinction next to some of my favorite sets and builds.&nbsp; Never did build the car, but I should.&nbsp; I think I will..</p>

<p>Today, I pulled her out to have a look, as I found this set listing on Brickset.&nbsp; Her tail is a bit yellowed, the sticker slightly peeling, and she needs a good dusting, but... darn if she isn&#39;t as pretty as the day she was first unboxed.&nbsp; Standing tall and proud on those wheels, sleek angles along the body and canopy, a nice wide set of wings.&nbsp; Small and sturdy enough to hold with ease, cool and stylish enough to still be fun after 20 years.</p>

<p>Few sets have ever matched this level of swooshability.&nbsp; 5/5</p>

<p>Just looking at her still makes me smile.&nbsp; Time for a dusting!</p>
