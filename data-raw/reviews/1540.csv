<p>This set was released as a &quot;custom&quot; mosaic, where buyers could upload a picture to LEGO&#39;s website, which would then be rasterized into a custom mosaic (you could make minor alterations within the editor, or even &quot;draw&quot; a custom design yourself without a base image).&nbsp; Alternatively, two &quot;standard&quot; images were available-- one of a cat&#39;s face, and one of a LEGO T-Rex.</p>

<p>The image is a 44x44 pixel graphic consisting of 4 colors: white, &quot;very light gray&quot;, light gray, dark gray, and black.&nbsp; The image was rendered using a variant of a program written by LEGO enthusiast Eric Harshbarger, modified for LEGO&#39;s website.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The contents of the set were made up of a fixed set of pieces for the mosaic frame and backing, and small bags of 1x1 plates, each containing 90 of a single color.&nbsp; Depending on your image, you could get between 22 and 26 total bags of 1x1s.&nbsp; The frame had an option to be built with a small hole to hang it up on a wall.</p>

<p>At the time, both very light gray and dark gray were difficult to come by, and this set was a welcome source of both colors.&nbsp; Otherwise, the fact that it included a 48x48 baseplate ($11 at the time) meant that the remaining 2300 (or so) pieces were only about $20-- considered a very good deal at the time.&nbsp; (Interestingly, the piece count was listed as 1,993 pieces even though the minimum amount that came with the set was 2,036)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As you might expect, the process of building the mosaic is tedious (recommended age range by LEGO was 10+), as there were nearly 2000 pieces to add individually, and mistakes are easy to make.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The resulting mosaic is nice, although probably not sophisticated enough to be a very nice showpiece, since the pixel level isn&#39;t sufficient for capturing much detail.&nbsp; It would have been aided greatly by a very wide color palette, or an option to make larger mosaics (neither of which were easy for LEGO to do at the time)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set remains an interesting experiment on LEGO&#39;s behalf that wasn&#39;t quite neat enough to be a winner, but marked perhaps the first time that LEGO sets could actually be highly customized for purchase.</p>
