<p>&nbsp;Comes in a small square pink bucket. I have since lost the instruction book.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Enough pieces to build several items without running out.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Mini figs are just two large bricks joined together, Mum, Dad, Baby and Parrot.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy to build, can make a building using the windows and doors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>i like the cute flowers with this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>great set for little kids. I&#39;d recommend this to buy for a child.</p>
