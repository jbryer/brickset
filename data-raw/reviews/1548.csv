"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-24T15:44:07Z","Awesome!","Altough there's no play value in this huge set,I like it.The reason why I'm only rating it 9 is, that you can get tired of all that sand green pieces. Otherwise it's very compact for the piece count.It sits on a 32x32 Baseplate.If you compare it to the 6398 or the big 6597 Airport,which have only 600 to 900 pieces and not 2882.
Simply great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-05T18:20:18Z","Sophisticated sculpture","I bought this set in summer last year. It was fun to build, although sometimes a bit difficult. Especially the head took me ages.

PROS:
- Very detailed sculpture, I wonder who created it. Must have been some kind of genius. It even features the balcony platform under her arm. Her back looks nice, too ^_^
-Quite a challenging model. I think the expression 'BUILDING toy' was well-chosen.

CONS
-The scale is too small and unfortunately it doesn't fit into a LEGO town!
-Where is the brown pedestal the original Statue stands on? Somehow looks incomplete.
-If you have kept it on display for a couple of weeks you might become bored with it. Would make a good vase:-)
-I would really have appreciated an alternate model in the directions

All in all it was a good idea to release this set. I'm really in favour of a little sightseeing series. The Akropolis, Bangkok's Wat arun or even the Royal Palace, Brandenburg Gate or a large-scale Egyptian Shinx would be further suggestions.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-06T15:15:30Z","Excellent set","This is a great set, I'm glad I have one. Th first time, when I saw this set............I WANT ONE :D. So a few months later I bought one.

I have this already 6 months. It stands proud in my lego(train)town. Altough it's not a minifigscale, it surely looks very great. It took me 8 hours to build it, but I'm glad it's build now. 

Just normal standard bricks and that it&#180;s possible to make such nice sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LEGOmyeggo","2007-12-26T13:12:30.03Z","Very good. ","Hello, brickset members! The rating is as follows:9.9 out of 10. The reasons: the use of light green makes it look realistic, unlike using a regular green. It is also very intricate but it would take long to build. The only thing that I request is that the base is just a big gray plate. The Statue of Liberty actually stands on a giant tan brick pedestal that's about the same height.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KeyPusher","2006-07-12T06:57:09Z","It sure took time to build, but it was worth it!","It took me three days to finish this statue, and when it was finished and I put it on display, I saw that all the hours of building was worth it. It is an extremely nice model, and it fits right into my growing model of New York City. 
This is a huge set, with lots of bricks (2882!!), and the price was very fair as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"inorde","2009-10-07T03:31:19.42Z","The main attraction of my collection","Want to show your sceptic friends that your hobby is a serious one? Show them this. Every single person I've shown Lady Liberty was amazed.

It's a sculpture so don't expect building it to be spectacular, but it will keep you busy for a few hours. The result is simply awesome. It scales well with my minifig size village, although it's smaller than it would have been if it were to scale, it's still an impressive sight.

I've been working on a pedestal to complete it. Nathan Sawaya built one and the pictures looked so good I wanted one myself. It'll be 1,5 times as big with the pedestal.

Spectacular set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
