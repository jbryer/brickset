Unfortunately, there are errors in the instructions: for the geometry to be perfect, the bottom tan technic bricks 1x8 need to be moved backwards 1 stud. The photo on the box is correctly assembled, and should be your guideline.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-01T15:06:27Z","Great fun is cheap these days","bought it just this week because Intertoys (a Dutch nation-wide shop) is selling them at Euro 19.95 these days . Not a joke, despite the date i write this. (they had a batch at Euro 15.00 earlier but i missed it). I found it great and a new LEGO-experience to build. I do agree with some reviewers that the lower wing comes of quite easily, but when not played with that's not a problem. The wires are a problem however. I just rotate the little bricks at the end to get some tension. Couldn't they have come up with some elastic material here ? By the way , the instruction booklet shows the layout of the wires wrong for the right wing on page 46. If you're Dutch, get it now !!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

building it was really fun! and for some reason I don't seem to have the problem of the bending wings like I read in the other reviews, and the ropes are easily adjustable by turning the ends a bit ! I love it!

Lots of useful, universal elements for quite low price, great design and many details makes this set really worth recommendation.
It's not true that wings are flimsy - if you connect them correctly and precisely they are ok.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-13T08:13:38Z","Do get the hump","If you read my review of Red Baron you will see i made the Camel after the Fokker Dr.1 so this review is based partly on comparison with that. Basically the set makes up into a large accurate rendition of the WW1 fighter. The rotary engine is very clever and although the cowling made out of balustrade bricks is see through, it has the advantage of allowing you to see the engine rotate with the prop as it should. Undercarriage is same construction as Dr.1 and strong and clever. Use of steering wheels for tyres is interesting, but better to use one spacing brick rather than the suggested 2 when applying the covers so they look like tyres. The weak point compared to the Dr.1 is the wings. There is a longer span and this is only a biplane. Consequently this tends to give a more flimsy construction as the wings are only attatched to the body at the bottom - and not very strongly. This gives a sag to the top wing whereas this should be level with the dihedral on the bottom wings. The bracing wires need adjusting to ensure they are all taut, but it is worth it. No working control surfaces. Once again this makes up into a large impressive model and i felt there was no need to modify to improve accuracy. However, i only give it a 9 due to the flimsy wing constuction and in comparison to the Dr.1 which i gave a 10. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-23T17:26:12Z","Could do better!","Generally a good copy of an over-rated plane; the wings are flimsy, even with alterations, the string &quot;wires&quot; don't reach properly and so augment the confusion.
Otherwise, an enjoyable set, now dismantled and the parts thrown into the pot of 25-30 year old pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T20:38:19Z","Splendid....","Good model. Worth the money. Go buy one if you don't have it since it's no longer at LEGO.com. I don't seem to have any problem with the wings coming apart. Mine's strong and sturdy. The only complain is that there's no tail or wing flaps. Planes can't take off and fly without it. Oh well, it's just a model. Nothing's perfect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-15T12:21:19Z","Sopwith Camel","Awesome set for the money, bought it for only 20 euros! Thats peanuts compared to the price other lego things such as model team. I did 2 hours to build this plane and that's very long for me. A lot of new lego parts in this set, so thats cool too. It's a much-have

A few comments:
The stickers, you have to put them over 3 or 4 rows of bricks so you can't rebuild this model, it will damage the stickers.
The wings are very thigt, in the middle of the plane i cant really put the lego together or it wil ge loose again. This means that the wings only at both sides are connected en thats to weak if you are planning to hang this plane. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-17T15:42:15Z","To a split-es and a hard stick port roll!","           This set is totally good! It is a beautiful model and you can even find a way to put figs in the cockpit!  The wings are nice and I personally love the flaps!  The machine guns on the nose are also a cool touch! This is perfect to display or fight against the Red Baron's Fokker Dr.1 triplane.  The colr scheme of this set is also good and so is the RAF symbol.  It has nice wings and the struts are cool too!  I like the spinning propeller and the landing gear can make for some smooth landings! I wish they made historic planes for minifigs, that would be the best ever!  This is defanitely a very good set to buy but it is a little weak in some places, which can be a pain!

"starwarsgeek101_","2008-04-16T07:17:04.67Z","Good for display, not for play","This plane is what older children or adults can build an play with. Otherwise, I advise you to display it. It is not one of those toys that you can hang from your cieling, for it is very, very heavy. I also advise you if you have children living to display the plane up high on a shelf or dresser. It works nice with all the pieces and functions. Overall this is an &quot;ok&quot; set because you can really only display it or else it will be ruined and destroyed. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"SR_71c","2009-01-06T21:51:25.92Z","WW1 Fighter ","This is a awsome lego plane! I got it for Cristmas and it is great for display. If you want to hang it from the ceiling you have to use several wires. Alot of people say it is heavy, but I don't think it is. It's very expensive on Ebay. Over all it is relstic, and detailed and a Great set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pendy","2010-12-14T21:34:05.003Z","cheapest set i ever bought","i bought this set for $3 at a second hand toy sale at my school thinking that the box only contained a few pieces but was still worth it at that price. when i got it home and looked in there though i found the set was almost 100% complete (minus two pieces) and i knew that i had probably just scored the lego bargain of my life.<div><br></div><div>the plane is fairly big considering how many pieces there actually are in the set, until i saw the final brick count on here (574) i always thought that there were a lot more, closer to around 700-750 just because it is so large. the variety of bricks in the set is another selling point in my opinion, there are a few pieces here that i don't have in any of my other sets or have never seen in these&nbsp;colors.</div><div><br></div><div>the size of the plane and the variety of the bricks made the set an exciting build, although i cant remember exactly how long it took me, possibly around 2-3 hours.</div><div><br></div><div>there are 3 areas where the set is let down though. firstly, there are stickers that cover multiple bricks, a real pet hate of mine when it comes to lego sets as its&nbsp;impossible&nbsp;to fully&nbsp;dismantle&nbsp;the set without removing the stickers. the stickers are also quite fragile, i had the plane on display on my desk for about 3 years, out of direct sunlight, and when i took it down to dismantled it this year i found all the stickers on the wings had cracked and were pretty much ruined, which i was pretty disappointed about.</div><div><br></div><div>the set is also a bit flimsy, especially on the wings. this isn't a huge problem if your using it for display only but as i had it when i was pretty young and still in to playing with lego,&nbsp;i used this set a bit and you always had to be careful with what you did as it&nbsp;wasn't&nbsp;hard to break, which kind of limited what you could do with it. it can also be a bit of a&nbsp;problem&nbsp;if you move the set around a bit, the wings broke off a couple of times when i was moving mine around</div><div><br></div><div>that kind of leads to my next point which is this set is only really fulfilling if your using it as a display set. after about a month or so of trying to play with it as a kid, i kind of gave up as it just kept on breaking, so i put it on display in my room instead. it was much better suited at this as it's size and detail made it look really impressive.</div><div><br></div><div>overall, as a set for display it's fantastic, but as a set to play with it's really lacking, which i don't think is a bad thing, it's just something to keep in mind when your buying it. for what i payed for the set i&nbsp;couldn't&nbsp;be happier, i think the retail on it here in Australia was around $120AUD if memory serves me well, so it was basically free. i've seen a sealed one on ebay for around $230AUD which i think is too much, even for an unopened one. if i were looking at buying one now, i wouldn't pay more than $100AUD. i also think it would be worth getting the red baron (10024) as well, just to complement the set. if you had both planes on display, it would look fantastic in my opinion.</div>",TRUE,4,4,4,2,5
