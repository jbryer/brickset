Amazingly this is the only one of my first 3 sets that I still have the instruction/story book that came with it, although it is very battered, held together with tape and the back page is missing ! However I usually don&#39;t need any instructions because I can still build it by memory. For a hospital it doesn&#39;t come with a lot. The two beds and visitor chairs had to be built (unlike future Fabuland furniture), and there was also an operating bed, and two chairs and a table on the outdoor roof plus a big umbrella. It also came with a staircase that just balanced&nbsp;next to&nbsp;the building (ie falls over) and a tree that also falls over a lot. Maybe that is what kept the hospital in business - climb a tree or just walk up the stairs - and bam you are in that operating room.</p>

<p>The biggest mystery of this set - and future sets - what is Doctor Dog&#39;s first name. Even when he seemed to have retired from fixing broken legs and was&nbsp;working in Catherine Cat&#39;s restaurant, he is still called DOCTOR Dog. A big mystery that has been on my mind for over 30 years !</p>
