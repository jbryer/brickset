I only have two dislikes.  The first one is that the top log easily rolls to the side.  This however, I easily fixed by adjusting the chains.  I moved one end of each chain over a stud and now it is fine.  My other dislike is that the black bars easily come off.  This makes it a little difficult to handle the car.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The blue and black color scheme works great and the profile blue bricks look great as well. The logs are simple, 1x1 round bricks and the chains are a plus as well. Like the other reviewer mentioned, the antenna pieces easily fall off but this isn't a reason to dislike this set. This car is similar to the car in the Holiday Train (which at the time of writing this is 50% off at LEGO.com) but the color scheme works in any set.
I bought this at a garage sale with a Tiny Turbo, some basketball parts and a few miscellaneous LEGO bricks. This is by far the best item in the lot. The base of the train, magnets, couplings, and wheels are all a valuable addition to my collection and I can't wait to make a MOC out of this train. For the price I paid this could easily be a 5 but it falls short of a 5 because of how plain this train is.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
