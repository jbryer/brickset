"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-24T14:15:07Z","Pretty nice"," This is a preety cool set. The car shape is (and allows it to be) rugged at all times. The only problem I have with it is, use of it is limited. Regular Lego sets or even Technic sets release an unlimited source of combonations and play though it is adequate, it is just slightly psychotic as well.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-06T08:50:49.697Z","LEGO Znap - Jet-Car Review","This is another great LEGO set from the past. The Znap theme may be forgotten by many LEGO collectors today. This theme wasn't a great theme but fun. Many sets like this jet-car have lot's of different models you can build with the pieces of that set. This set may doesn't have any play features but it's very easy to build and fun to play with as well. We also don't have to worry about stickers. All of those vehicles in this model are very fun to maneuver and for sure. It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for 
MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
