The build is very nice and easy and we get lot's of different models you can make with the pieces of this set as well. We also don't have to worry about stickers. This vehicle may doesn't have any play features but you're able to maneuver it very easily, too. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for 
MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
