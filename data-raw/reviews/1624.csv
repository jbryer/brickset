"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-30T08:47:02.837Z","LEGO Sports (Gravity Games) - Skateboard Street Park Review","This is the only set of the LEGO Sports (Gravity Games) theme I've got. And it's a cool one. It has a few stickers which you need to put on as well. The build is very easy and quick. We get two different ramps for the skateboarder which is a really cool looking minifig. The one ramp has a wall and a tree and between of the other ramp you can see a table which is also a nice addition to any LEGO city. It's really fun to play with. If you have the skateboarder from the series 1 and 4 of the collectable minifigure theme you can have a great competition for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"HarleyMeenen","2018-04-20T21:27:38.38Z","Really Nothing Special","<p>This set is small, but I was excited to try it out. Unfortunately, there just isn&#39;t that much to say about it. It&#39;s a quick, simple, somewhat repetitive build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When built, the set consists of two baseplates, one with a table flanked by ramps, the other with a rail for grinding. There is a single minifigure&nbsp;with a skateboard. Additionally, there is a clear piece used to control the figure.</p>

<p>I had assumed this set would have great playable aspects. However, it is pretty lacking. There are so few elements to interact with, and the pole used to control the skater makes it difficult to achieve any kind of smooth movement.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a set I would recommend. It&#39;s a cool idea, and fun for a few minutes, but there are much better sets out there.</p>
