I got this on sale and after building it, my son and I played with it for days. It has a launcher to send the dude flying up the hill and sometime he will land just right or do a flip its fun to mess with. Really like the mini figure in this set he is &quot;hip&quot;, overall a fun set to own.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros: 
Nice Minifig
Cool Ramp

Cons:
The Launcher hurts you hand when you hit it.
The guy rarley makes it over

It is still a fun set, and the minifig is great to mix with the other Gravity Games Sets.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legojoe6678","2009-12-09T18:17:51.45Z","It's still Sports? Right?","   Even though the launcher doesn't work that doesn't mean
that this set is horrible. Even without the launcher the ramp 
is cool. Right? The mini-figure is cool too, with his/hers snow-
board, I mean come on. At Least it's LEGO and thank this set
for the pieces. RARE. 

  I will recommend this set to ANY one who would
like to have some RARE pieces. Still, you can do some
sweet tricks without the launcher. :D

It&#39;s a pretty small, quick, uneventful build. As others have said, the launcher doesn&#39;t work that well. I think the design for it could have been a lot better and generated more power. As it is, it&#39;s entertaining enough, just a little frustrating to never have the minifigure&nbsp;land. The alternate builds listed in the back look more promising, and I may well convert to those.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s not a bad set, it&#39;s just not a very good set either.</p>
