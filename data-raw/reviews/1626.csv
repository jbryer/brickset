This set falls prey to the same problems as others in the&nbsp;Gravity Games line: an easy build that fails to deliver after completion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is simple and unexciting. The set looks good enough when completed, but the functionality isn&#39;t there. The figures don&#39;t go down the ramp on their own without falling over and the trick handle is unwieldy. I did have a little success using the skateboards like a Tech Deck. Overall, though, a set that should be highly playable is borderline unworkable.</p>

<p>In the end, I can&#39;t recommend this set for anyone but skating enthusiasts who want a ramp to display and never use.</p>
