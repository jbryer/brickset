"mrmitch","2007-06-05T02:30:00.89Z","Quick action and alot of useful parts","This thing is big once you get it put together, it will take over the kitchen table. Lots of base plates a few jumps you must flip up just in time make it a blast to play with. My 6 year old at the time played with this for days. I got mine on sale but knowing what I do about the set would probably pay full price now.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lostcarpark","2010-12-28T05:24:51.503Z","Great fun","This is a great set for playability. The slope is a fairly basic build, using baseplates and monorail supports.<br><br>Once built, the snowboarders have weighted bases to allow them to stay upright, and can be launched from the top of the slope. Various obstacles, including adjustable ramps add to the challenge of getting the snowboarder safely to the bottom.<br><br>As a snowboarding LEGO fan, this was the perfect Christmas present!<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-08-06T15:28:40.577Z","One of A Kind","My last review was posted before I started liking the set again. I had to make some alterations(e.g. relocating ramps, adding ramps, removing ramps etc.) to suit my liking. Also, I made the hill steeper by raising the supports 10 bricks higher, to ensure that the snowboarders don't stop halfway down the hill. It's very fun to watch the snowboarders go downhill lightning fast, let me tell you that.  The main reason I wanted to rebuild this set was because my Lego town needed some sort of recreation. The set comes with nice parts like the white baseplates, supports, and snowboards so why waste nice pieces like these? The only problem is that sometimes the snowboarders trip and fall. Also, I don't know how to use the launch pads so I removed them.  Oh well, these are only minor problems. Overall great set and I don't regret rebuilding it. I re-rate it 9/10.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"t20a1h5u23","2008-12-14T22:52:27.56Z","A great set","This set is great to have.

Pros: 
Great Minifigs 
Ramps 
A finish line

Cons: 
They don't always make it to the finish line
The ramps make them fall over.

I added the Orient Expidetion Yeti to this set to make it more fun. This is a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

There&#39;s not much to the build, really- it goes quickly and there aren&#39;t really any challenging techniques.</p>

<p>That said, it looks nice when completed. There aren&#39;t many extraneous details- a tree, some flags, and a few billboards. Most of what is in the set is put to use- there are several hills and obstacles for the snowboarders to jump off- or fall over on.</p>

<p>The key to this set is the playability. It&#39;s not easy- you have to send the figures off with the right speed, in the right spots, and with the right timing if you choose to use the flip-up section. It takes some practice, and even then it&#39;s not perfect. But when it goes well, it&#39;s highly satisfying and very cool to watch. The figures ride down rather smoothly, coming to a clean finish at the end.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a perfect set, but it&#39;s a cool idea and it&#39;s fun to fiddle with and see what you can get the figures to do.</p>
