For fun get the feeder set, it actually is fun. this set also really needs a goal! And all you sticker haters! THERE IS A STICKER ON THE PUCK!

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-15T10:12:07.303Z","LEGO Sports (Hockey) - Puck Passer Review","This figure is very easy to build and to play with. We also get a few stickers to worry about. This figure is very easy to maneuver as well. One thing which is interesting is that the canister of this set can be used as a bottle. The play feature as the same as in the other sets of the LEGO Sports (Hockey) theme: The head can be pushed down which will move the hockey stick which is going to hit the puck.  It's a good set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
