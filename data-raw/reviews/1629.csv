"BaneShake","2009-05-26T11:01:08.123Z","Slap Shot Review","   This set is a pretty great Lego innovation. Not many people would expect building bricks to move in any way at all. Here are some pros and cos.
   The good: fun to play with against other hockey figures
                  bright, rare orange elements that fit along with Bionicle
                  detailed pieces such as the hockey stick and mask are a great belonging
   The bad: somewhat jerky movements
                the main body piece doesn't go well with anything other than hockey       players ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legoguy2805","2009-07-27T08:30:03.483Z","Bionicle hockey player?","When I was given this, the first thing I noticed was there is a lot of Bionicle pieces: Nuva armour, Pewku claws, Matoran head.

The new pieces are also very Bionicle-like. The mask might as well be a Kanohi, the stick might as well be a Vahki staff.

Anyway, this is a surreal representation of a hockey player. I say 'surreal' because it doesn't have any arms or legs, and the stick is coming out of the body.

Although, Slap Shot is quite fun to play with. The 'armour' is detailed and the slammer sytem is very cleverly worked out. You could spend hours whacking the two pucks across the room.

Pros:
Good Colour Scheme
Stands up well
Slammer system works well
Get spare masks free with the set
MOCISTS: Lots of Bionicle pieces

Cons:
The stickers on the pucks don't fit on properly
Some arms and legs would be nice
Pucks easy to lose

Overall, quite a entertaining set, 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-15T10:06:52.883Z","LEGO Sports (Hockey) - Slap Shot Review","This figure almost doesn't have any play features but it's still a good set to build and to play with. The built is very easy and this set is very easy to maneuver as well. We also get a few stickers in this set. What's interesting about these LEGO Sports (Hockey) sets is that the canister can be also used as a bottle if you want. The only play feature we get is the same as in the other LEGO Sports (Hockey) sets: You're able to push the head of this figure down if you want to move the hockey stick which is going to hit the puck. It's a good set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
