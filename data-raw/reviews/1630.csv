"SaintElsewhere","2008-11-11T12:42:41.437Z","Meh","I got this for my birthday several years ago from a hockey-obsessed friend. I never really used it as I have never been into hockey. It's rather simple compared to the Lego I like and so is hardly my cup of tea, so to speak. I never really thought the trigger was that great, but I did like the interchangeable faces and the water bottle packaging.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BaneShake","2009-05-26T11:06:29.373Z","Flip Shot Review","   As I said with slap shot, the moving is a great innovation. Here are the pros and cons.
   The good: bright and fun-looking
                  the movement is better than that of slap shot
                  fun to use with other hockey sets
   The bad: very limited ways to use it",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-14T10:15:57.013Z","LEGO Sports (Hockey) - Flip Shot Review","This set may doesn't have a lot of play features but it's still a good set to have. This figure is very easy to build and very easy to maneuver as well. We also get a few stickers to worry about. What's interesting about this set is that you can use the canister as a bottle if you want. The play feature is the same as in the other LEGO Sports (Hockey) hockey player figure sets: The head can be pushed down if you want to move the hockey stick which is going to hit the puck. It's a good set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"tkettle9719","2011-12-17T09:07:21.647Z","An unusually good find...","<p>I'm not a big sports fan, but I instantly fell in love with this set when my mom got it many years ago for me at Tuesday morning while on vacation. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-The mask changes, while I don't really use them, are fun to change, or even as sub pucks. <br></li><li>-This product has many Bionicle parts (happy me).<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Maybe some legs. I get why, but it would make the product realistic. <br></li><li>-This set has some Technic elements that are much too noticeable. <br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>This set is good, and does look nice, but does have flaws. I recommend it, but if you're big into detail, don't take the pros and cons lightly.&nbsp; <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
