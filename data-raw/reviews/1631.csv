"SaintElsewhere","2009-05-24T15:20:35.623Z","Ugh. No thanks.","First of all, I have never, despite being Canadian, been a hockey fan. The only reason that I kept this was that it was a gift. Not to mention the water bottle container. Quite frankly, the water bottle is the only thing that saves this from a rating of 1/5. 

Pros:
water bottle

Cons:
these sets don't work on their own
not enough pieces
interchangeable masks may seem like a good idea, but they're just strange when you look at them
stick function isn't that good",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

It may doesn't have a lot of play features but the figure is very easy to maneuver and to build. We also get a few stickers in this set. The helmet can be pushed down if you want to move the hockey stick which can shoot the puck. It's a good set to play with and it's also good for pieces which you can use for some future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms as well. What's also interesting about this set is that you can use the canister as a bottle if you want.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
