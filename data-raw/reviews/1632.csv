The huge rink made you feel like you had your own miniature rink and i played with non LEGO sticks for years to come. one of LEGO's finest with the BEST SPORT EVER! I throughly enjoyed the setup of this one, the NHL stickers put it all into place and it was easy to play with. PS Go Flyers!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
