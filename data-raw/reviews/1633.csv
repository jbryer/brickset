What is it supposed to be, some robot hockey guy? No one that I know understands this set. You're better off using it for extra pieces. I DO NOT RECOMEND BUYING IT!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

It features a creepy robotic hockey player, and a mysterious device apparently meant to shoot hockey pucks at him/it. This set is poorly designed, unpleasant to look at, and generally just plain weird. The ONLY things I like about this set are the parts. It contains a few interesting pieces, namely a hockey stick which I have often used as a meat cleaver, and a creepy hockey mask which can make for some <span style=""font-style: italic;"">interesting</span> TECHNIC MOCs. All-in-all, I am happy I got this set for about a dollar at a thrift store. As well as being practically free, it also came with extra hockey masks, which is appreciated. However, if you would ever have to pay more then a few dollars for this set, simply don't bother, unless you are a fan of homicidal robotic hockey players.<br>",TRUE,1,3,1,1,1
