If you don't want to buy a whole basketball stadium, 2 of these will do the trick. I remember the mechanism of pushing, or flicking the basketball player up not always working too well, but its cool when it does work well. The piece of cardboard behind had somefamous faces as spectators on it, and it can be quite fun to find them all. The basketball player has curved hands so he holds the ball well.
Overall, a slightly unreliable but fun set for any sports fan.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-16T20:05:18.45Z","Sometimes it doesn't work","This set comes with a cardboard with basketball net and audience picture on it, a blue baseplate, a basketball player (specially designed arms to hold ball, but normal legs). and a simple lever system which allows the player to dunk the ball. You have to flick the black, rounded edge as hard as you can in order to sink the ball. However, that stubborn player sometimes just won't let go of the ball! It can help if you bend his waist backward while he holds the ball and flinging upward, that way, the proper angle is formed so the ball can slip out of that heck of a death grip and into the net! You can get this for about 5 dollars CAN.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
