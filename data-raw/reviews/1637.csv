The way he jumps to shoot the ball is very akward, it is very difficult to get a basket(you almonst need three hands to make it work correctly). Wouldn't recommend it unless you just want to add to your collection. I picked up this set for under $2.00.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-03-23T09:17:54.543Z","inacceptable","taking into account that lego tried to make small, affordable sets, i still must say that this is not the way to do it. my impression is that the whole sports-line, especially regarding the nba sets, was a huge failure, and this set is an excellent demonstration how that came to pass: it's not playable, it contains too specialized parts (net, baseplate), and the face of the minifig is plainly ugly. 
i just picked up a few because they did cost just 50 cents - that shows how urgently even the shops tried to get rid of them.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"DarthVader_","2008-03-27T11:53:21.467Z","Cool set.","This was a cool set.  It was one of my first sets.  I really like the goal and the mini fig!  I wish I could re-build it back because I lost the peices, but I really liked it and I wished I had it back!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-30T03:16:31.7Z","He shoots, he scores!","I got this set cheap and I think that this set isn't very nice at all. It comes with a single minifig which looks cool and has awesome cornrow hairstyle. There is also a red plate which is similar to the plates used in Minifigure Packs. The hoop seems to be larger than the minifigure but oh well. The thing that holds the hoop is the worst part of the set - a shoddy card with 'audience' printed on it. There is the common see-saw technique used to propel the minifig upwards just like a basketballer dunking. I think this set should be classified as an impulse set because there are so little pieces (even less than an average impulse set)

Pros:
rare pieces
cool minifig
Cons:
Arms are loose
Hands cannot be moved
This set is still cool but it has a few down comments
