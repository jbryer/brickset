<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>At first look, I did not even realize that this was a Lego set.&nbsp; It looks much more like Kinex than Lego.&nbsp; I bought this for my 7 year old son, and the instructions are not up to the usual quality I expected.&nbsp; It was difficult to determine which parts were being added at each step, especially since every piece is vastly different than regular Lego pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>These parts are ugly, and very difficult for a child to put together.&nbsp; The joints are tight and require a lot of pressure, but even more is required to separate the pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are no minifigs in this set</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Even though the book is large, there are two images per page, so the images feel small.&nbsp; There were several times I had to closely examine the pictures to figure out what pieces were needed and where they connected.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is simplistic, but my son enjoys playing with it because it has two spinning blades.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I hated everything about this build, and would not purchase any other znap sets, unless they had motors I could repurpose in a regular Lego build.</p>
