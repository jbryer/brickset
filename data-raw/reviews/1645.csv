This is great for any basketball fan, even if he/she hates lego! It also has cards for the minifigs. You can add these and other basketball minifigure sets to make an incredible all-star team!!

You get Tim Duncan, Ray Allen, and Pau Gasol, who are all great basketball players. Even though this is outdated because Ray Allen is somewhere else and Gasol is on the Lakers, I do think that this is a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradosis","2009-06-16T02:30:56.36Z","Only If You're A Fan","This somewhat outdated set includes Duncan, Allen and Gasol, players in the NBA.  The main reason I can think of for people to buy this set is if you are a fan of one of the players in it. I suppose you could also buy it to add some diversity to your Lego community, but then if we're not talking about fleshies, then no diversity is needed as we are all one color: yellow! One issue I have with these minifigs is that they're even less posable than normal minifigs. So, sorry to any fans of these guys, but I'd only give this set a 55/100.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

For one, your getting the basketball jersey torsos, which could be useful later on in building. Next, you get all these various styles of flesh-colored heads, coming in many different skin tones. Lastly, you get some nice minifig stands, which allow you to display a card along with it. The downside the stands is they have the sports logo on them, though.",FALSE,4,5,3,3,4
