It has 3 figs and 3 stand-up's and 3 stupid collecters cards, It's no Pokemon. I have one face used for a black pirate. There were ofcourse also black pirates.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-11T08:22:11.143Z","LEGO Sports (Basketball) - NBA Collectors #2 Review","This set may doesn't have any play features but it's a good one to have. We get 3 minifigs which are famous NBA basketball players. The players are: Tony Parker, Antoine Walker and Shaquille O'Neal. We also get a card and a stand for each figure. This set has a good collector's value but I would still recommend you to get the bigger sets of this theme first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
