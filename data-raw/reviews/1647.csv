sorted all garbage out, all that remains are 3 very pretty printed torsos, 2 brown heads and 1 blond hair-piece. so don't worry if you miss this set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-10T10:16:34.157Z","LEGO Sports (Basketball) - NBA Collectors #3 Review","This set has 3 minifigs which are famous basketball players. The 3 famous basketball players are: Vince Carter, Gary Payton and Dirk Nowitzki. We also get a card and a stand for those figures. This set may doesn't have any play features but it still has a good collector's value. This is a good set to have but I would still recommend you to get the bigger sets of this theme first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
