Don't pay more than 30 cents for a basketball player minifig. A lot of people are selling for like .90 per player, but I got this set for $1.00, and it's barely worth $1.00. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-10T10:11:03.747Z","LEGO Sports (Basketball) - NBA Collectors #4 Review","This set may doesn't have any play features but it still has a nice collector's value because of the minifigs. The minifigs are very famous basketball players. This set includes 3 of those in total: Kobe Bryant, Jason Kidd and Toni Kukoc. We also get a stand and a card for each figure. It's a good set to have but I would recommend you to get the bigger sets of this theme first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
