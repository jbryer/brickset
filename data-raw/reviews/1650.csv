Steve Nash (Dallas Mavericks)
He sports a dark blue jersey and has a tanned skin. The head looks like the ones Indiana Jones have, except with blue eyes.

Jerry Stackhouse (Detroit Pistons)
He wears a blue jersey with maroon trims and the head details are very cool.

Paul Pierce (Boston Celtics)
He wears the usual green outfit and is very detailed.

The minifigs even come with special tan display plates which also holds their bio cards.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

However, if you got this set, it would be outdated because Steve Nash is on the Phoenix Suns and Jerry Stackhouse is with the Washington Wizards. Paul Pierce on the other hand has won an NBA title with the same team, the Boston Celtics. This is pretty for minifigs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
