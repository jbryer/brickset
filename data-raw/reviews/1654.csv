It is planned well and is surprisingly cheap. It is very cool for sports lovers, especially if you have all the other sports complexes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"mocha","2007-08-18T23:30:14.8Z","Outstanding!","this hockey rink is so sweet! Every thing is so cool! I espesialy like the details on the ice. the only things that could have been better are  1 the glass should go all the way around  2 there should be 2 more guys 4 each team and a ref.  3 there should be penelty box, scorekeeping box benches, score board but if they added all of those it would cost too much. overall great playability. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-04-28T22:21:59.983Z","Good","This is the most fantastic hockey set I've seen since I started playing with Lego. The rink is made of individual 8x16 flat plates (I think there were 8 of these). When pieced together, you get a hockey rink with 4 faceoff circles, a center faceoff circle, blue lines and red, dotted center line. There are glass boards, nets and goal lights. The whole rink is finished with a nice, blue outline. Each team comes with three players excluding goalie. You can customize your own teams using stickers with all 30 teams from the NHL, but each team only comes with one sticker. One player (the one in the center) can reach almost anywhere on the ice (This player is attached to a beam 32 studs long). The rest 2 players are attached to 16 stud long beams. Although they have less range, they are easier to control. The players are attached to a turning platform powered by a gear system. However, you must make sure the beam is completely locked in to the gear, otherwise it won't work. You must also make sure the piece the players stand on is locked in securely into the platform. You can shoot the puck in two different ways, one, it's a slap shot that stays on the ground, or two, a top corner shot, which requires quick wrist power. To make this shot, you have to grab on to the handle (the black part) tightly, so as you turn with your thumb, the thumb will slip (the stress will make it slip very quickly), making the platform rotate quickly as well, causing the puck to be propelled into the air using such force. As a 32 stud long beam is quite long, it will obviously bend easily. I experienced a problem with this defect. The bent beam causes the turning of the platform to be uneven. For example if you turn it one circle, you will feel friction coming and going between the blade and ice. Sometimes this even causes the player to flip over on its side, bending the beam even more. If this is the case, I suggest that you better have an extra 32 beam lying around, because it will come in handy! Overall great set but the defect brings it down a rating.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
