I loved the sand macaroni pieces, the black &quot;street&quot; pieces,
and the long black technic axels.

That is waaaaay to much for this set, although it is nice. It has a street lamp, some billboards, nice road pieaces, long black technic poles. I added some railing around it, but it looks mine without it too. Two nice figs, with logo shirts, rare coloured pants, and one has a helmet, the other just a hat. One face (the one with glasses) I got from Arkham Asylum, but he is black, not yellow. The other has a huge smile, which looks kind of funny. Also the game is fun. I want to get the real hockey stadium too. Good set, really old, and fun. The best thing about sports sets is: lots of figs, and rare pieces.
Also this is just what my town needs, a little hockey park, looks great across from my soccer stadium in my town!

However, I'm impressed by the overall design and playability of this set. The small arena is pretty cool and the signs aren't bad either. I could probably play with this for an hour then I'll get bored and stop. This set is pretty good and is a fun set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Great fun, no Cons and it's cool to have
a street hockey match with a friend.

 I suggest a LEGO fan or a sports
fan should have this set.

 That is all

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-14T09:07:36.233Z","LEGO Sports (Hockey) - NHL Street Hockey Review","This is one of my only hockey stadiums I have and I really can't complain about it. The build is fun and it's also fun to play with. I like the way how LEGO did the two staffs with the stands for the minifigs which you can slide across the field. There's also a goal on each side and we also get three pucks. It's a really fun set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
