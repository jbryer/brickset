I'm going to review this in reverse order of the bullet points.<br><br>-Value:<br>This was a birthday gift so I have no idea how much it cost compared to the parts, however, since Lego seems to have gotten far more expensive as of late I'm guessing the value was quite high.<br><br>-Playability:<br>I spent hours of years playing with this set; due to the largeness of the pieces and many different designs it had to offer I would often use other toys with it the set. My favorite was to make a blimp and put a small Beanie Baby in the center as if it was his airship. It was definitely one of my most favorite play things and I can admit to still picking up the pieces now and again 10-12 years later.<br><br>-Parts:<br>These are not your typical Lego pieces, instead most are large with curved or distinct angled shapes. Mostly allowing for the building of vehicles of various kinds. They can be connected to traditional Legos with Technic pieces. However, I never managed to make much good combining the two.<br><br>-Building Experience:<br>This is one of ZNAP's strong suits. This particular set comes with a thick manual with several different designs each large and enjoyable to build, at least they were for me when I was a pre-teen; now, I would probably find them far too simple, but then again, I find that of most Lego designs and I love building with them anyway. Because ZNAP is nothing like Lego many a creative child would most likely enjoy the novelty of building Legos in a different way.<br><br>-Overall Rating:<br>4.5",TRUE,4,3,5,5,3
