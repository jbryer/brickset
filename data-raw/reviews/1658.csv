It works well for what it is though......a simple game where the mini-fig (with spring loaded legs) shoots the ball and if it goes in the basket it returns right back to the mini-fig through a clever slide. If you miss........well you need to retrieve the ball. Avoid that by not missing which is not that hard.

That is about it in terms of set value though and unless you combine it with other sports sets, are a huge basketball/lego fan, or leave it on your office desk (like me) for the occasional shot and work distraction it is easy to lose interest in the set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-04T10:14:02.89Z","LEGO Sports (Basketball) - Repid Return Review","This set is a fun and easy build and it's also fun to play with. What I think is the coolest part of this set is the minifig. The LEGO Sports (Basketball) figures have different torsos, arms and legs than the regular ones. One difference is that the legs have springs in it which makes it easier for you to throw the balls into the basket. The arms are longer than a regular minifig as well which makes it easier for the figure to hold the ball.<br><br>Another thing which is different about the regular minifig and the LEGO Sports (Basketball) figures is thar you can't remove the arms from the torso and you also can't move the legs separately. The rest of this set is very cool as well. I like the way how LEGO printed the basketball piece. There're also no stickers to worry about and I think it's a great set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
