"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-28T00:00:00Z","","This set is a horrible deal. 50 USD for only 225 pieces! So many big, specialized pieces. Even if those pieces are needed, the price could be lowered to make the piece to price ratio reasonable. The front and back pieces originally from 375 are back, in this set, or at least something similiar is. Only two snowboarders. There is also a large ramp which you can only see a bit of leading into the Super Pipe. If stands (that could comfortably seat eight), and four spectators, and a few minor details, such as water bottles and trophies were added for the same price, this would then be a good deal.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-08T01:03:55Z","JUNK!","Im glad I got it at 75% off... It doesn't work. you have to angle the ramp just right to get the guy in the ppipe. Or  even harder to make him zoom up on the side. Its more fun taking the ramb off making it almost vertical and torturing the guys.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

little water damage. I took it home opened it and built it and have had a blast
with it. You can make the snowboarders do different tricks by leaning them
different ways and by moving the ramp in different directions or by starting
the snow board in different spots on the ramp. After wanting this kit for about
8 years it is everything I expected it to be. Sure it might have been expensive
but you cannot deny the fun factor. If you are in to half pipe snowboarding and
a LEGO fan you should get this kit.</font></p>

"HarleyMeenen","2016-09-11T19:47:18.82Z","Not Great","<p>I love the concept behind this set, as I have with all of the snowboarding sets. However, the design does have some serious issues. More often than not, the snowboarders&nbsp;faceplant&nbsp;soon after leaving the ramp. They don&#39;t really travel up the pipe on their own. Additionally, the trick handle is too large to work within the ramp and the figures occasionally fly off of it.</p>

<p>The build looks nice and all three sets together make a nice theme. But the playability factor is pretty low, which can be disappointing.</p>
