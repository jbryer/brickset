"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-20T10:27:26.89Z","LEGO Seasonal (Christmas) - Santa Review","This is a good little figure to have and it's also fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't have to worry about stickery. This figure may doesn't have any play features but it's still easy to maneuver. This set also makes a good decoration for Christmas for sure. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for 
MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. Happy holidays!<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>It's a good-looking Santa.</li><li>It comes with a nice printed brick.</li><li>The building process demonstrates good fundamental techniques for novice MOC builders.</li><li>Can be employed for various roles, even within your Lego City.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>

<p>If you can get your hands on this set, do so. &nbsp;You won't regret it.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,2,4
