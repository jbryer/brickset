What's interesting is although Mark is supposedly selling fruit (presumably bananas), nothing to put in the wheelbarrow comes with the set. I know most people will just put assorted random Lego into the wheelbarrow, but what if it was a kid's first set? Mark would go bankrupt and the entire economy of Fabuland could suffer. In the comic that was included in the box the cartoon version of Mark is selling cartoon bananas, making it only more frustrating.

I compromised at the time by sitting Mark in the wheelbarrow and pretended it was a two-wheeled car (with the handles as exhaust pipes). Not good for the environment, but it was the 80s so nobody minded much.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
