For years it has functioned (being red and all) as my towns fire-department.
Nowadays it's neatly tugged away in a cosy backlot-square, only accessible through the archway of the (1620) chocolatefactory, somewhere in the centre of my town. This sounds like I've send this building into retirement, but nothing could be farther from the truth.
Wherever you place this garage, it gives a sense of a building that stood there for ages and that it will continue to hold its ground untill the end of civilisation. In its simplicity this set tends to catch the eye as being the everlasting heart and soul of your town.
But maybe this set has had to be your first set in order to appreciate its beauty the way I do, -sigh-.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But i think that LEGO should re release this et as one of them Legend series, like what they did to the pizzaria (#10036).

The Garage set is very simple. It's just a few dozens red bricks for the walls, and a black roof, with four windows, a door and a double garage door. But it looks great even side by side with the most recent town buildings sets. 

The pieces are basic but very usable, and the fact that the roof is a three-piece and even the baseplate is split in two, give this small set a high building value.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BWhyte","2011-02-26T17:02:13.32Z","A classic little set","I just finished this set with some purchase of missing pieces thru Bricklink.&nbsp; The final hard to find pieces were the white doors.&nbsp; The set is small and easy to assemble but there is something about it that makes it unique.&nbsp; Back when the set was launched and before the mass market auto repair shops there were many garages like this that would do work on vehicles.&nbsp; As we move away from teaching kids shop and auto repair and as cars become computerized, we have moved away from these types of shops in towns all over America.&nbsp; This little piece of nostalgia is a great reminder of those times.&nbsp; Also, it was one of the first sets with minifigs and that makes it a true collector piece.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

A chunky five chunky score for this set as the parts were amazing for the year and it was worth all £13 as a collectable set. There literally is no flaw present.</div></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"omnius","2019-03-30T00:57:38.003Z","Not bad, but lacking detail","<p>Part of the early minifigure&nbsp;era, this garage set was introduced to a fledgling Town range in 1979, though if it wasn&#39;t for the printed brick on the roof, you&#39;d be hard-pressed to tell what it is.</p>

<p>This set is unusual for a Town set in that it has a rear wall, which sets it apart from Lego&#39;s traditional open-rear buildings. While this does limit the set&#39;s playability, unfortunately you&#39;;re not missing much. Apart from opening doors and a minifigure with a shovel and a brush, there&#39;s really very little to play with. Some extra features - spare tyres, oil cans or even just storage boxes - would have added a little extra playability. As it stands, the building is essentially just a box.</p>

<p>This set does score highly for value for money in that it is quite cheap on the secondary market. I&#39;d only really recommend this if you want to pick up a Town building at a relatively low price, or you&#39;re a completist. It&#39;s by no means terrible, but it&#39;s one of the relatively weaker sets of this era.</p>

Though 7642 looks more modern, this set is still pretty good, especially for towns some 30 years ago. It comes with cool doors for the cars to come in, a side door, a minifig and a couple of tools for him to use. Overall this is a great set and will still work well in any town.

"Gamlebilrokker","2021-03-26T19:00:39.043Z","Perfect.","<p>After I got frustrated with a recent Police Station from LEGO City that I got for my kid, and which is just a pain to play with, I decided that I shall get him some simple old sets to play with. This was the first one I ever got (right now we are at circa 250) and it&#39;s such a joy to have. Simple build, sturdy, perfect play value for a kid that likes cars. I should revisit it a bit, maybe make a row of them like you can see here or there in bigger cities.</p>

"peti7788","2021-12-13T23:47:09.973Z","Building addition?","<p>When I saw this set in an old catalog, I first thought it was a workshop. But there are no vehicles or tools...&nbsp;Because why would someone write on the top of their own garage that it&rsquo;s a garage, since it&rsquo;s obvious, isn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;Okay, I get it, the kids don&#39;t accidentally look at this as a warehouse or chicken coop.&nbsp;Let&#39;s write to it, that&#39;s for sure!</p>

<p>Okay, but what can you do with this set?&nbsp;I see two things: storing things in it, like a small car or motorcycle, and cleaning the yard.&nbsp;After all, there is only one shovel and one broom.&nbsp;On the other hand, storing tools is imaginative with a black horizontal fence element.&nbsp;If you get a modern lego dog poop item, you will also have something to clean in the yard.</p>

<h3>Minifig</h3>

<p>Exactly this minifigure is also used in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/588-1/Police-Headquarters"" target=""_blank"">588 set</a>. But he happened to be a handyman or a <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6383-1/Public-Works-Center"" target=""_blank"">construction worker</a> in a few smaller sets with a helmet on his head.&nbsp;So torso color and printing are not uncommon and special.&nbsp;The picture also shows the prototype hair mold.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>What I like is that the building is completely enclosed, not just a facade like it is today.&nbsp;I think it would be better if they added a smaller vehicle, say a motorcycle. A vehicle is very much missing from this set because it is so empty.&nbsp;But even a street lamp or a tree would throw it up.</p>

<p><strong>On the other hand, it is perfect for an additional building if you already have a car or a house, say it is ideal for the</strong> <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/376-2"" target=""_blank"">376 set</a>.</p>

<h3>My mod</h3>

<p>Since I felt little and empty of this set, I added a contemporary motorcycle to it that could be stored in the garage.</p>

<p>Since there was no motorcycle chassis at the time, I built it from traditional elements. And it knows what modern lego bikes don&rsquo;t: it turns the front fork and the front wheel too.</p>
