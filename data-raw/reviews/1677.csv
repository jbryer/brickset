I searched for years to find an image just to know the name and number of this set. I looked on your site for about 4min and found it!!! This must be my all time favourit set (maybe because my little brother wasn't born jet, so I could play with it). My parents must have digged deep in there pockets, back when, this set cost about $10.00. I know that was a lot of money for them. Now I saw it for sale for ONLY $90.00, it's only money!!!! I only mis the baseplate, the rest is battered or bend. But it is my set and I love it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-11T15:21:34Z","BRING IT BACK oldshool lego!!!","A long time ago, I got this set from my parents. It was the biggest set in years and at the time one of the first doors that could actually open. I had never seen such a big set(this whas before the whole space lego). 

And now, 30 odd years later, I still look back at this set and think it is a classic. I hope lego will bring it back someday. I for one would buy it, just so my children could get the feel of what real lego should be.

As I write this, I got the set standing on my desk. And I know one of the original instructions is coming my way.

And you know what, after some thirty years, that's a damn good feeling!  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-20T18:31:54Z","1974 that was long before most of you were even born!!!","Back in those days everything was better, housing, shools and even the lego was better!!!
(o, shut up!)

But they did make this box, the bakery.

When going over my lego, I found this juwel again and it surprised me how many pieces there are. This was ahead of it's time and still fits between my other town legos.
It gives a feel of that time, but in Holland and Belgium, you can still find real houses that look like this.

Now it is a crackeling bakery, the crackeling being the cookie in the shape of the sign on the building. The cookie is a little bit sticky because of the suger used on it.

So, when in Holland in a small city called Heukelum, ask for a krakeling(cookie) and dream of this set!!!

"ajsantos","2005-12-23T10:42:23Z","A great classic","Received this almost 30 years ago. My first house set. Rebuilt it recently (great memories). Have adapted it to minifig &quot;use&quot; by removing back wall, augmenting lower floor by one row to allow for a 1x4x5 door, and installing a mid floor. Just add some furniture (bed, kitchen, living room) and some garden furniture, and it makes a great addition to a classic layout. All the more since the color scheme (yellow walls / blue roof) was never used on later minifig houses. Recomended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rafalko","2009-12-18T07:35:59.14Z","Should be 361-1 (not 361-2), because the set 361-2 was later one, called GARAGE","I bought the set a few years ago. For years it was one of my dream sets. Big source for yellow bricks, and red fence with entrancies.

But: there's a mistake at brickset. The set should be called 361-1 instead of 361-2, because the set was produced in 1974! At the time lego even didn't think about minifigs in their sets... First minifigs came in 1975, and minifigs with hands and legs in 1977 (first sets in the USA) and 1978 (Europe).

There's no minifigs in the set! But in the set 361 from the year 1979, called now 361-1 instead of 361-2, there were 1 minifig looking exactly as at the picture above.

I'm still missing the climate of middle seventies, when all boildings had all walls, and looked very realistic. The set is one of them - for this I give maximum note!

And what is the city without houses, backeries, shops, hospital? When lego leaders will notice, that another fire stations and police departments are not enough to create a city? Police officers and fire chiefs cannot work 24 hours a day at their offcies - they all should have a place to live - their own houses.
How long time should we all wait till nice buildings from lego will be produced?

Of course it is a rethorical question...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-27T17:41:46.31Z","A rushed design","While it doesn't look horrible, this very old house model doesn't look like it received enough attention during design, judging from several aspects.

First of all, it is not in scale with the minifigures, which is a penalty but it should be understood that at that time minifigs were not around at all. This however devalues the set because it has no direct compatibility with following sets.

There are lots of details that seems wrong: there is space for a second floor but there is no floor of it, no inner furniture, very blunt chimney, old-type windows which sadly cannot be opened (but on other hand the upper floor window has two shutters that cannot work together), a terrible car design, a parking place which is too short to cover the car. To top it all, what is a TV antenna doing on a bakery... and on top of the chimney!

Nostalgia aside, this set needs serious modifications. It can be salvaged for the red fence with opening gates only.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
