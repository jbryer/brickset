The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. This set may doesn't have any play features but it makes a good decoration for Christmas for sure. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure. Happy holidays!<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
