Only the two big grey plates are nice to have.But..... the animals in this set are loved by all who come and play and they are adorable. Mother cow and little cow, daddy horse and little johney, mother pig and baby pig(baby stands on a little plate!!)then there are a sheep, a dog and a chicken. Why not a few chickens and a baby sheep. This is afterall a big box. The play cloth isn't very playable, because the farm isn't very sturdy. As you put it on the cloth (as on the box) the whole thing fals to pieces. It looks like a large box but it would have bin easier to just put a lot of animals in a smaller box. The farm itself is alot of air and is not playeble. There is no structure in it so children of the 2+ age simply run it over while playing with it. The picture plate is nice and gives the whole thing the right feel of a farm. The farmer, kid and wife (or older daughter?)are nice

GOOD things;The ANIMALS
            The Tractor(is this the right word)
            The trailer
            The ANIMALS (did I mention The ANIMALS)

BAD things ;Some animals do not fit in the trailer 
            The cloth!!(isn't even lego)
            Should have bin a few more animals
            It looks bigger than it really is
            Not sturdy enough for children of this age

But after all of the above; WE ALL LOVE THE ANIMALS!!!!

And that is what this set is all about.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
