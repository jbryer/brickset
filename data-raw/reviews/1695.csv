<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of this set, you get two minifigures, a little motorcycle, ladder and broom. And for the age group of children that this is intended for, the minifigures and accessories are usually just what they want to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not a bad little set and I remember many hours of play with this and other Fabuland sets.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,4
