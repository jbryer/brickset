"pod120","2009-03-08T05:35:44.983Z","Useful, and Very Realistic","In May 2007 I knew that I was going to get the 7898 Cargo Train Deluxe for my Birthday. I spotted this at a Lego shop, and although it was 50 Dollars AUD, I couldn't go without it. However, I built it and put it next to the 7897 Passenger Train and realised that it was a slightly larger scale, as Cabooses are not a very large carriage. So I took out 1 layer of bricks between the roof and the tops of the 3 windows. Also a very realistic design for 2001 and looks great when added to the end of 7898 Cargo Train Deluxe.

Pros
-Fire Oven, Chair and Small Table are good additions to the Interior Cabin
-Wheels fit the width of the RC Train Tracks released in 2006
-Ladder and Piping on top add to the look of the Caboose
-Balcony on Door end of caboose is very useful
-Has the same Magnetic Couplings and Buffers as RC Train Sets released in 2006
-Works very well with 2006 RC Train Sets, especially 7898

Cons
-Roof pieces do not remove easily to allow interior play
-Certain pieces easily fall off
-Personally I don't think the Door was necessary, but it cannot be used anyway when one layer of bricks has been removed
-May have looked better if black tinged were used instead of blue",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
