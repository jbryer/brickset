<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charlie Crow's Carry-All offers a little bit more a complex design for a child who's beginning to explore LEGO and moving away from playing with Duplo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's hours of play a child can have loading up the back of the truck with the garbage can accessory and piling the shovel and broom up behind as the minifigure drives about looking for something else to collect or clean up.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,3
