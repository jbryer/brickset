<p>This is Bonny Rabbit, the minifigure and her little car/camper that introduces some more complex building then many of the single pack Minifigure and Accessory sets. There's flowers that can be used for landscaping. A large Lego chest for holding and storage.</p>
<p>Instead of being out camping, the minifigure could be selling flowers by the road side.</p>
<p>It's a fun little set, that helps a child's imagination move to more complex ideas and designs with Lego.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,3
"Lion_knight","2019-09-14T18:13:00.22Z","Bonnie is selling flowers in this set, not camping","<p>The name of this set looks like an example of miscommunication between Lego Group&#39;s various departments.</p>

<p>Lego designers probably envisioned Bonnie Bunny to sell flowers in this set (pictures on the box and instructions shows something that can be best described as a flower stall, one picture in the instructions shows Bonnie selling flowers in the town center, and the van is decorated with flowers because the idea probably was that it transports flowers).</p>

<p>However, someone in Lego Groups&#39;s Marketing department thought that this is just a camper, so they gave it a name &quot;Bonnie Bunny&#39;s Camper&quot;.</p>

<p>By the way, two years later (in 1983), Lego released another set with Bonnie Bunny (3627). In that set Bonnie again transports flowers in a small truck/van.</p>
