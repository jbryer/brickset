I heard that this series (Fabuland) was intended to build a bridge from a Duplo user to regular Lego. And I think Lego done a really great job doing it.<br>The set is quite simple and easy to build. You got two cupboard, one dressing table, and a bed. It's really simple, but not as simple as Duplo series. <br><br>One thing that really special about fabuland for me is the minifig. They slightly bigger than regular minifig, but still smaller compared with their Duplo counterpart. And still moveable. You can move the hand and feets. You even can move the head right and left (as well as rotate it as regular minifig). <br><br>I wish I had more Fabuland sets, but seems it will be very hard to get some of these.<br><br>Anyway, if you happen to stumble on one, just get it. It's part of Lego history, and it's quite cute to play with.<br><br>",TRUE,4,5,2,4,4
