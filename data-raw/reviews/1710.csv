All Catherine need to prepare a nice meal to her Fabuland-friends on her nice cooking-range. The cutest little refridgerator is included in this set and has a little box inside for the wegetables. The little wash-basin where Catherin wash her hands (or paws?) before eating is also very cute. To do the set more realistic, it comes with a number of food-decorated bricks. If you like Fabuland, this is a set-must-have;-)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
