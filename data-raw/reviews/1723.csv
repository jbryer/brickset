<p>This bus is very much in the classic London Bus style (ie red) although modern buses (even those from 1987 like this one) don&#39;t have the stairs on the outside. But it is is more accurate with it&#39;s seating -&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t have many seats - two upstairs, space downstairs - which is quite familiar to anyone who uses city buses ! !</p>

<p>For a Fabuland town in England (ie my Fabuland town) the stairs are the &#39;wrong&#39; way round for the side of the road we drive on ! It was always a risk for Hannah Hippo getting off the bus that she wouldn&#39;t be run over by Ricky Raccoon on his motorbike !</p>

<p>I love this bus. The stairs are great and got used on almost any house I built. The railings on the upstairs are lovely, they got used as garden/balcony decoration a lot. And flags ! Why don&#39;t real buses have flags? And the yellow shutters - just great.</p>

<p>This was the last set I ever got. It was decided that at age 12 I was getting a bit &#39;old&#39; for Fabuland. This bus meant an end of an era for me. But as a set to &#39;go out with&#39; this was one to go out with in style. Fantastic toy, fantastic pieces and would look just great as a model sat on a shelf.</p>
