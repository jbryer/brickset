<p>I have always been a fan of these Fabuland sets. Maybe because the minifigs&nbsp;transported the young-me into a world of fairytales and wonder, of fabels&nbsp;and mystery.</p>

<p>Here we have the Fabuland&nbsp;police office. A nice little set with a jail, office-space, a nice cool motorcycle and 2 bull-dogs acting as coppers. (what a great choice of animal, I mean,...these dogs actually could be the animal-police :D)</p>

<p>There are some wonderful pieces in this set: the printed mug-shot plates, the telephone, the motorcycle and a&nbsp;red signal paddle, which doesn&#39;t &nbsp;come in too many sets. The wall-pieces are nice to have and also the roof-piece is kinda good looking, although these pieces don&#39;t have much use outside of the Fabuland-theme.</p>

<p>The figs are great, although they unfortunately come without any printed torso&#39;s. Its nice to see these animal figs, and they are, for me, the reason that&nbsp;makes Fabuland&nbsp;great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is easy but still interesting. The instructions are, like with all Fabuland sets, insane: you actually have the figs building their police office in the instructions: Cool :D. The pace is fast and many items are put together with each step. This will make the building process unusual for new LEGO-fans.<br />
The final result is a bit sparse, but does&nbsp;the job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t a lot of playability because we are missing out on bad guys. Adding these is therefor a must.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROS<br />
-great printed pieces<br />
-great minifigs<br />
-nice little build<br />
<br />
CONS<br />
-not much playability<br />
-needs adding on to if you want to have a completed structure</p>
