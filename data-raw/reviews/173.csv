Pros:
FREE!
4 jets can be used on MOCs
Large propellar can also be used on MOCs
relatively accurate to an acutal helicopter
block pieces

Cons:
There is not much use for the set by itself as it has no unique features

Overall:
get it...if you can!
it is free (or at least mine was) so there is no worry about money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
