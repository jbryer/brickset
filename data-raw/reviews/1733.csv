Being a child, I loved the idea of&nbsp;animals coming alive and living in a world of their own that resembled the world I lived in. It must be the reason why I like Chima so much, and I feel sorry I never had the chance to pick up 1 or 2 Chima sets when they were released. Although the actual builds were often a bit &quot;meh&quot;, the minfigures&nbsp;looked stunning.</p>

<p>This Fabuland Motel/Hotel is a fun little set. We get an entrance-foyer-cooking area on the first floor and 2 rooms on the second floor (bedroom and dining room)&nbsp;with a little roof terrace. The build is simple and straightforward, with big wall and roof elements&nbsp;making up the main structure. Like with all larger&nbsp;Fabuland sets, the instructions show the minifigures&nbsp;actually building their own set, which is just great and adds to the building experience.&nbsp;<br />
Besides the actual set, the booklet includes&nbsp;building instructions for 3&nbsp;alternate models: an outdoor barbecue, a restaurant and a mobile kitchen thingy,...don&#39;t really know what it is: you decide!</p>

<p>Almost all of the interior and exterior&nbsp;detailing&nbsp;comes form the separate furniture and accessorie&nbsp;pieces that come with this set. There is a bed, 2 tables, 2 chairs, nice red umbrella&#39;s, several bread-pieces, a&nbsp;large cooking pot, a broom,....simply too much to mention. It are these accessories that make the real highlight of this set. Remove them, and there is not much to see, but add them, and your imagination will kick in. And that&#39;s what Fabuland is all about: imagination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hours of fun and play are guaranteed.</p>

<p>There is one bad thing about this set: the stickers. Some of them are placed over multiple Lego pieces, making it hard for them to last:&nbsp;none of my stickers survived the test of time. Also, the little bike/car gets a popsicle sticker, when it is clearly used to transport bread :)</p>

<p>Oh well, let&#39;s not nitpick</p>

<p>This set is pure gold, and if you disagree with me, you are simply wrong :D</p>
