One of my favourite features of the Fabuland sets were the instruction booklets in the form of a story.  I was able to draw inspiration from these booklets to aid in my play and develop the chracters and the story beyond the final page.

The sheer size of this set was mind blowing to me when I was ten and looking at it today it's still an impressive sight.  The fact that it came with four minifigs was great as well, even if one of them was Max mouse, who I already had in abundance.

The various movable features made it a really fun set to play with.  Both the carousel and the ferris wheel moved fluidly and even the roulette game spun.  The inclusion of prizes for that game as well just added to the detail and fun of the set.

Of my Fabuland sets, this was my absolute favourite and still brings back wonderful memories for me.  A well deserved 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
