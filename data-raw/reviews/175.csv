Nadda. The litle buggy has cool radar and is a good incuding if you have a nack for spaceport",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2009-01-04T17:37:08.42Z","Moon buggy? How will he breathe?","This is a nice little set with some nice peices too.

Pros:
trans-neon green radar dish
walkie talkie
nice minifig
cool and easy build

Cons:
If it's on the moon, why doesn't the minifig have a helmet 'stead of a hat?

Overall good set, 4/5 get it if you get the chance!

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-03-29T10:11:36.037Z","LEGO Town (Space Port) - Space Port Moon Buggy Review","<p>This is a good little set to have and it's fun to play with as well.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 25 pieces. I don't know how much it was when it was on sale but I think this set is worth the money.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The figure has a white overall, a blue cap and a headset. It's a very nice looking figure for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/1180-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br></p><p>This vehicle may doesn't do much but it's still very easy to maneuver it. The only play feature which we get is that the radar can be adjusted. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><span></span></p><h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
