Despite what you've seen on nature programmes Fabuland displays a brightly coloured nirvana of humanoid animals running towns and amusement parks. We couldn't quite tell what Lego was up to so these characters may have fitted in to our minifigure Town as 'townspeople in costume'. Even just as animal masks then more terrifyingly they now kind of seem part of a gaudy Wicker Man playscape.</p><p><b>Minifigures:</b></p><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4><p></p><ul><li>The cooking pot &amp; ladel are put to use brilliantly in other themes too.</li></ul><p></p><div><b>Porker</b></div><div>There seemed little, alright no, construction involved. It was more a figure and accessory kind of set. Peter Pig (the Cook) comes with a cooking pot and ladel so he can boil up a delicious stew, soup or casserole. Whether this involves him jumping in the pot is another matter, threatened by the presence of the occaisional predator in the series.&nbsp;On the box however he's dreaming of eating a roast chicken but then pigs will eat almost anything.</div><div><br></div><div>The cooking pot is a decent piece and the animal head pretty good but the body is a bit basic. Only ever owning a couple of characters, we were not proper collectors of Fabuland but it makes an otherwise amusing if strange sideshow to Legoland Town and thats as far as it can be reviewed here... bon appetit.</div>",TRUE,3,4,1,3,1
