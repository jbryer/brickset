<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This one is that of a blue elephant with a broom and shovel. What the elephant or Ernie can be doing with those pieces is filled with endless possibilities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These small Fabuland sets work perfectly and cater to an age group of children who are largely interested in just a minifigure to play with and some accessories and not always bricks to build with, or they may not be quiet there ready for brick building.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,3

Its a preposterous inclusion because the elephants are so badly scaled next to the smaller animals but as they are for young children, it matters not.</p><p><b>Minifigures:</b></p><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4><p></p><ul><li>Another good face print.</li><li>Great pieces to hold.</li></ul><p></p><div><b>Dusty Trunk</b></div><div>Ernie here gets an excellent Fabubroom and Fabushovel and can go about Fabuland cleaning up all that Fabudirt. Small children will no doubt love these and instantly recognise their favourite animals.&nbsp;The projection of animal characters or aspects in to humanoid settings is an ancient tribal practice and so Disney can not really be solely blamed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If you like Fabuland less and prefer older kids themes then you are not alone. Not to worry as they make good aliens for Space and mascots for Lego Town, looking the part in an MOC amusement park... just don't name it Fabuland. However, in reverse minifigures don't mix well into the Fabuland setting and in play the little MFs might run screaming from the giant were-animals in an abstractly shaped, strangely coloured hell.</div>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,1
