They appeal greatly to an age group of children who are mainly interested in only a minifigure and accessories to play with and may not be ready to do the more complex building of Lego Bricks or are moving away from Duplo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this one, we get a cow minifure, rake and watering can. I still have my minifigure and watering can after all these years and have long since lost the rake. My daughter has many hours of fun with the Fabuland figures despite their age, proving that LEGO does have a timeless quality to them.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,3
