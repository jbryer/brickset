That said, these sets mainly appeal to an age group of children who are likely only interested in playing with the minifigure and accessories and aren't ready to move onto more complex building with Lego or are moving away from Duplo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set features a brown rabbit minifigure, basket and a couple loaves of bread. I remember many hours pairing him up with Bonny Bunny from another set and having him be a customer for my Ice Cream Shoppe set and selling bread.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,4,3

In Fabuland Rufus gets a decent print and brown bunny head for small children to play with and the excellent basket and two loaves of bread. These characters can interact with their various chores and make a world of mixed animal multiculturalism. A sibling got Rufus and therefore held the special bread pieces.</p><p><b>Minifigures:</b></p><h4><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b><b>[</b><b>路</b><b>路]</b></h4><p></p><ul><li>Good illustrative print.</li><li>Excellent basket and bread pieces.</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Rabbit Baguette<br></b>An affordable alternative to Sylvanian Families, Fabuland offered a route in to construction sets for youngsters who loved animals. They are a strong removal from the other themes offered by Lego but can at times be intermixed when imagination lacks control. As animal character construction sets go, Richard Scarry's Puzzletown sets seemed to be the best for this age group.&nbsp;The bread and possibly basket were used repeatedly by our village folk in Castle and our bakers in Town. Baked, delivered and sold over and over they provided huge playability and breadth (ha) of use over the entire collection, despite a minifigure never being able to clutch one.</p>",TRUE,3,5,1,4,1
