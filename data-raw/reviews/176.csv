<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instruction has only 2 pages and there're no mistakes in it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has 23 pieces. I don't know how much it was when it was on sale but I think this little model is worth the money.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The figure has a white overall, a white helmet, a golden visor and a headset on his face. It's a very nice minifig for sure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is very nice and easy and we also don't have to complain about stickers.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/1181-1.jpg[/img]</span></p><p><br><span></span></p>This set may doesn't do anything but it's still fun to maneuver it. The design on this model looks nice but I don't think that lot's of you would have liked this set if it was produced this year. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure.
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
