Building it is straightforward, and I do like the fact that you <i>build</i>&nbsp;the horses as well. There are four of them, two of which are yellow for some reason, and six faceless cowboys. These 'hands in pockets' minifigures were only current for a few years and they do lack personality. Substituting the heads for smiley ones does make a big difference. Still, having six figures in a smallish set is pretty good going, and it's enough to create all kinds of Western-style scenarios using just this set.</div><div><br></div><div>There's instructions for the main model only, but the box is covered with illustrations of all kinds of ideas for using the excellent mix of basic parts here. If I have a criticism, it is simply that almost all of the permutations of building - including the main one - are too small to be of any use; another fifty or so red bricks would go a long way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It's the horses that really make this set. Having four of them is great, and the fact that you can take them to bits and make a (small) herd of cattle for the cowboys to drive across the plains adds to the fun. Or tweak a few pieces for a bucking rodeo horse... loads of possibilities. Better still is the fact that the riding cowboy's legs wrap around the horse, rather than being embedded in it...</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, this makes an excellent play set. There's so many things you can do with this, helped by the presence of a good-sized baseplate, that it can provide many hours of fun. For a vintage set, it's pretty affordable too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
