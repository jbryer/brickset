Thanks to this website you are able to get a copy of the instructions and then buy the bricks from LEGO to create it!  A bit annoying though, as a lot of this requires flats and not bricks.  I was able to adjust it so I only had to use bricks, I just used every third instruction, with a few adjustments. The result still looks impressive.

My fingers ached after I spent three hours one Sunday morning snapping it together - the sticker on the front is now peeling slightly, but it still stands proudly in my kitchen, annoying the hell out of my wife.

It is all made out of Lego bricks which makes this set really big. I do wish Lego made a female minifigure also, but I don't know if that will happen. This is a great set and should be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alva","2011-02-21T21:49:16.96Z","Lovely Lego Minifig","Since the first time I went back from my dark age a couple years ago, this set always been in my Must-Have list. I am a minifig addict, I really like their design, and this set giving me a larger than life minifig.<br><br>But the set is already out of stock at that time, and I think it will cost me too much to buy it from outside my country.<br>So I decided to build it from parts. Bought the parts here and there, mostly on my local bricklink stores. The parts is really easy to collect, since most of them are only common bricks (2x2, 2x3, 2x4).<br><br>There's some problem for getting the longer brick, such as the 2x8, 2x10, but i managed to replace them with shorter bricks. E.g 1 brick 2x10 = 2 bricks 2x4 plus 1 brick 2x2.<br>It creates no problem to the construction so you can try that way too.<br><br>The part collecting took around 1 year to finish. It was quite long cause I was not focusing all my efforts, just every now and then, when I remembered, I check local stores for their part stocks.<br><br>The building proccess itself is quite fun to do. It took around 4 hours for me to finish the building. And man, I am really amazed with the size. It really stunning size. I put this set in my living room, and everytime I have guests visiting the house, their first comment is always about this set. This is really a set for show off:P<br><br>For me, this set is really a representation of what Lego stands for.<br>Because :<br>1. The set is about minifig, the face of Lego.<br>2. The set is build mostly using bricks and plates, two of the most common parts in Lego world<br><br>Pro :<br>1. Pose-able arm<br>2. Rotating hand<br>3. Very impressive when put in display<br><br>Con :<br>1. The foot part is not rotate-able<br><br>I hope Lego will launch another set like this in the future. Hopefully a Female minifig, so I can put the two together as a couple.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,1,5
"Chemistry2101","2019-05-09T23:13:33.71Z","A LEGO minifig on a different scale","<p>Before I launch straight into my opinions on this particular set I feel some context is required. This set is one of just two that have been in my family since before I was born, and this is the one that I always remember having around me as I grew up. As (perhaps unwisely) a plaything for a growing child who loved (and still loves) the LEGO brick, my copy of this set has been disassembled more times I can remember, and used as scrap parts, parts have been lost (or chewed up in my younger days) over the years, the original green baseplate is cracked and unusable, and all of the blue pieces original to the model are faded quite badly. The box and stickers are long gone, and the instructions (although complete) are in several pieces. Yet after all this time (and several bricklink orders) he is complete, standing proudly alongside my other big models. Yes, there are no stickers, and the parts aren&#39;t all original, and the blue pieces are faded, but to me he is the one LEGO set I really could never imagine selling, and he will always hold a special place amongst the other sets in my collection.</p>

<p>The set itself is a beautiful homage to the LEGO minifig; it&#39;s blocky, sure, but in a lovable, stylised way that doesn&#39;t make him look outdated in the slightest.</p>

<p>The build is fun, and after all these years I&#39;ve done it enough times to truly be able to say it is better than most. I love the period instructions from a time before SNOT techniques became all the range, and there&#39;s something about the build that makes this set feel like really genuine, solid LEGO, with none of the modcons we see today. It really harks back to a time when creativity triumphed over predesigned models.</p>

<p>Do I love this set? Yes, I would probably say I do. Do I feel nostalgic about it? Certainly. Am I able to give an objective view of it? Probably not.</p>

<p>Would I recommend you buy it? That depends. If you want it for a showy display piece, I&#39;d say look elsewhere. If you love the heritage of LEGO, and you love the concept of the minifig, then this is probably a set you should consider. I will reiterate though that this is really for LEGO lovers only, not just for people who have a lot of LEGO and like collecting. It&#39;s about where TLG has been, and remembering it&#39;s heritage as we look forwards to what is to come.</p>

"dirkberlin","2020-06-24T17:53:07.63Z","A fantasic opinion for a retro MOC","<p>First a noticed the store, when I was on a way to be an adult. This and the other sculptures you could see in warehouses. My time with lego was for me over, the seemed to be small when you see other decoration in stores, very edgy and expensive.</p>

<p>So many years later my interest for lego were newly awakened. My problem: uncompleted lego sets. A few I could build, but the largest amount were bricks from basic stones and even stones from my older brother from legoland sets from the 70ths. The sets from nowadays&nbsp; uses a lots of new items, I failed to build even small brickheads. So I go through this database and found again this set.</p>

<p>The Torso is a simple build. Only Basic Bricks in 36 Layers. Of Course I do not Have the stones in right model and colour, but it&#39;s easy to replace. My guy is look like mario. Red trousers, blue shirt, red cap. Missed building a moustache. Hands, Arms and Head have plenty of plates. There I had to replace more building steps, but I can use a lot of stuff, that I never needed. Even a amount of discoloured stones make no huge optical error.</p>

<p>So give the Model a try. You can use old stuff and make a own moc on it. It&#39;s a cuty little fellow, my got, 46 cm and 2.5 kg. Like a real (newborn) child.</p>
