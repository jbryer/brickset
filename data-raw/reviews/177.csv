"_add_um","2007-03-08T15:42:21.127Z","COOL!!","I got this in Spain long after it retired. Good set if you need a Johnny Thunder and a scorpion and most importantly a chain! It can also go with the jungle sets. Not much playablity so add it up with an other set. I recommend this to any adventurers fan.",FALSE,4,3,2,2,5
"Blade","2007-09-05T10:34:47.317Z","River Raft","Just finished rebuilding this one so felt it was fair to review him now. Well it's another one of those basic $3 AU models. Its Johnny Thunder on a small river raft. The raft has a paddle and a chain for docking. 

Johnny Thunder is in the standard black pants and adventurer shirt. Has the wide brim hat and a pistol. The Animal for this set is a scorpion.

Overall its a good little set and deserves a 5/10. Its very aesthetically pleasing, but very little playability unless put in with its brother sets or series. If you are an adventure fan this one is for your collection. Also If you collect this is a good display.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-01T18:40:43.09Z","Simple raft","This is a small and a simple raft of the adventurers theme, including the johnny thunder minifigure, the main character of the theme. This is a simple raft, don't including buildings or more than one minifigure, but still great for one small set, being an addition for the theme. It is easy to build and play with, due to the size and to don't be very complex. It have a chain, and a cool color to combine with the minifigure, is a different raft, and have too another things also included on the theme, like the scorpion and the hat of the minifigure.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-23T13:31:09.18Z","LEGO Adventurers (Desert) - Adventurers Raft Review","This set is one of my smallest LEGO Adventurers sets I own. It has some nice pieces which you can use for MOC's and brickfilms and you also get a paddle, a revolver and a scorpion. We also get Johnny Thunder who is in most sets. I know he's a cool character and everybody likes him but I also have to admit that he's in too many sets. But I still like this figure too. He also reminds me a little bit of Indiana Jones. The raft is an easy built and very sturdy. We don't get much play features in this set but if you want the pieces then I would recommend you to get this set.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"losinglemo","2019-03-26T17:42:41.073Z","I...I Don't get it.","<p>A very weird little set. Featuring Lego&#39;s greatest adventurer and a basic build that provides playability and.. curiosity. What is the story behind this set? Whats going on?</p>

<p>So... following the instructions.. why on earth does a scorpion need to be put on a chain? So Johnny has a chained scorpion on a raft.. why? Is it a pet? Is it bait for fishing? Is it secretly the world most powerful scorpion that must remain chained at all times? why?!</p>

<p>Minifigures.</p>

<p>Johnny Thunder is included in the set in his iconic,&nbsp;original desert gear and hat. Always a treat to see. Prepared for any adventure there is no Lego&nbsp;universe Johnny can&#39;t fit in to with an adventure.</p>

<p>Build.</p>

<p>The build itself is very basic which is to be expected in such a small promotional set. A little raft with.. chain attachment. WHY?!&nbsp; Is the chain for steering? Anchoring? Strangling? Restraining? Why? Why is that chain there?! Keeping that damn scorpion on a leash.</p>

<p>Accessories.</p>

<p>The raft comes with two oars to paddle and steer (Chains not for steering then), also included is the worlds mightiest scorpion and Johnny is armed with two revolver pistols (which will be of no use to fight off the Scorpion of invincible death).</p>

<p>Also comes with a cute little&nbsp;set of instructions to help construct the raft. Sadly no cool advertisements of a childhood era&nbsp;long gone. Unfortunately this set is difficult to find sealed and prices have hiked. However if the cheap opportunity rises its worth a look.. especially for owning the worlds most powerful scorpion piece.</p>
