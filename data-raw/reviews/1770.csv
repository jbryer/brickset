And this dragon is extremely cute, fun to build and gives a lot of green bricks to use for other things if you can bare to take the dragon apart!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"kmitchell","2005-05-23T00:36:31Z","Instructions should be freely available!","There should be more sculptures available for purchase. I live in Australia and have never had the chance to purchase this from a shop.  Thanks to this website I am finally able to get a copy of the instructions and then buy the bricks from LEGO to create it!
This is the only place on the web that has the instructions, thankyou so.. much!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My son was given it at birth and it sat on a shelf for 12 years. Bought direct from the Lego store.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
