<p>However, if your Lego collection had <em>nothing</em> but these, you could still build something <em>brilliant</em>.&nbsp;That's the beauty of Lego!</p>
<p>This is a supplemental pack of 50 tan bricks, so it would be very good for addition to Adventurers, Indiana Jones and similar themes, or any nature, building, construction or wildlife theme. Build walls, houses, statues, roadways, etc.</p>
<p>With this set you can build a hollow pyramid five bricks high, with a few bricks leftover to make some very rectangular statues. Add minifigures to worship ancient Egyptian Gods or perform Aztec rituals. Take it apart and build a suntanned Stone Henge. </p>
<p>(I have only rated this set low on 'value for money' because you can buy 2 x 4 bricks for about 5c each on Bricklink.)</p>",TRUE,5,3,5,5,3
