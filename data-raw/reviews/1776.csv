However, as a jackolantern, I think it is pretty amazing, nice bright orange (though somewhat unrealistic) , and with two of these you could make a proper 3d one! And, it would be even better with a light behind it. Would also be better if it came with a stand- its easy to knock over without.

 I suppose instructions weren't included because this was sold as &quot;Bulk Bricks&quot; , not as a proper boxed set. In US, for the 3D version (2 sets of these bricks), instructions came stapled to the receipt.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

(If only Lego did sets like this for christmas like a snowman or christmas tree rather than the ones they do do)

Pros:
Can make a 3D pumpkin with two of these sets
Lots of orange pieces that is quite rare
The 2D pumpkin is easierly changeable to give different looks
Best seasonal Lego set(in my opinion)

Cons:
The 3D pumpkin is quite small
Instructions do not have enough steps - it was hard to tell if I had done all each step asked(especially for the 3D pumpkin)
3D pumpkin is very hard to put together in the first few steps as it is so fragile

Overall it does have alot of orange pieces, which I did not have any of before and the 3D pumpkin although smaller than I expected did look great and pumpkiny.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

However, I don't like that you have to build it online, but Lego might want to save save paper. The orange pieces are great and there are alot of them. 5 out of 5 for a good Halloween set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I loved all of the orange pieces. (No wonder orange is my favorite color.)

This is a great Halloween set and I recommend you get it if you can.
