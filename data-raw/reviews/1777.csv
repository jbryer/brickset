Goes good if you have some inventory of light grey bricks like 1 x 8's, you can get pretty creative with (stone walls) ruined houses etc. - worth ordering from S@H.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2007-08-06T23:50:47.69Z","pretty good!","this set is pretty good but it could have been in service packs if it came with, 2xbows with holders, 2xswords, and one fig. those would be a great addition to this &quot;set&quot;. I recommend combing this set with Legends set Black Falcons Fortress!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-11-23T16:56:05.903Z","Good expander pack","These are things you need to make your castle bigger or to built MOCs. This set would have been better if it had come with ordinary gray bricks (1x1,1x2, etc.). And there is no arch with the format 1x3. It's too bad they were not included. Anyway, with the parts you get it should be easy to build your own castle. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-16T21:12:57.827Z","okay..","this set is all right but i wouldent recomend it. it would of been a lot better with some normal light-gray peices. but realy everyone has light gray pieces and you can build some things with it, but not enough for a castle. also, there is realy no nead for the blue tower tops. this set is ok and you would need more than one to build anything worth building.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-06-27T14:52:57.187Z","MOre useful additions to your castle","This is another set from the Bulk bricks theme, and part of the castle theme. Unlike the set 10066 (Castle Accessories), this isn't useful for minifigures, but for your own castle creation, good to increase it, specially the towers. At the first view, this set looks like to includes few pieces, and really includes few pieces (24 pieces).

Te most common color scheme among the pieces is the light gray scheme. The color is really common in the entire theme, useful to castles, houses, ruins, workshops, blacksmiths and scenery for battle fields. The shapes aren't very useful to make massive towers, becauses the pieces aren't bricks, are to increase the siege parts, and also the &quot;windows&quot; of the castle. The four blue pieces with pyramidal shape are the ideal to increase any top of a tower, and four are the sufficient to make it, altough you can't make a tower completely with these 24 pieces.

Overall, the set is very good and useful, to any castle creation, because increases any tower or buildings. But 24 pieces are really few, and the variety isn't that great, have just six types of pieces included, 4 pieces of each piece. It could includes more variety and pieces, but still good. If you find this by aprox few less than the impulse sets, maybe it will be good. But this still a 4,4 out of 5. More variety is the way, but these pieces are very common among the entire castle theme, so still being very useful. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
