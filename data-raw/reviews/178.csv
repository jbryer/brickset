"Blade","2007-09-05T11:09:46.99Z","Taking My Jewel for a Walk","Another neat little model from the adventure series. This one is a mummy pushing a cart. He appears to be following the map that is at the back of the cart. I think also the diamond at the top is helping guide him with the light or something but you can make your won story line. Cart has the small cart wheels which are appropriate here, and the map has the dogs head on it for you map hunters.

The mini-fig as i mentioned is a mummy, in full dress, white face, headdress and septer. No real faults with this model and with a whole 17 pieces should there be?

Overall it another good little one to add to the Adventure series so another 5/10 because it is average, not bad but nothing special. I would recommend buying it if you find it somewhere online or a swap meet or something.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-23T15:30:17.513Z","A good way to have the Mummy minifigure","This is a small set of the desert subtheme on the adventurers theme. Was one of the first sets, this is basically a cart with easy builting without buildings. To a small set, this needs to be reviewed with small ones, not with all lego sets, and for that this deserves a good rate. The minifigure is of a mummy, don't like the skeletical ones, this have a lego normal minifigure body and the mummy details like the hat of pharaoh. The cart is small like the small ones from the castle theme. The colors looks like with the environment of desert and with the map color. The cart is made with three plates, one where is putted the wheels for carts and castle (isn't good for city sets) and one above and one under it to keep the builting solid. A pyramidal piece is on the front, and a jewel with this, this can be putted (and of course be removed) from this piece. A map is too included, like on the other sets from this subtheme. The features are the jewel, the mummy's minifigure and it's hat, and the map, to make the adventure completed. This set was also a cheap and easy way to have the cool mummy minifigure. The cart is cool to play with, and the pieces are useful, altough be few. To a small set, this deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-23T13:36:57.43Z","LEGO Adventurers (Desert) - Mummy and Cart Review","This set is the cheapest way to get the LEGO Adventurers mummy from the desert subtheme. The cart is very simple to build and it comes with some useful pieces for MOC's and brickfilms. This set also includes a ruby and a cool looking map. The mummy minifig is awsome too. I like the yellow hood with the markings and I also like the scary looking face on him. The torso and the brinted legs are awsome too. If you want to get this set for the minifig and for the pieces I would recommend you to pick this set up.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Cake_Crafted","2016-05-12T19:21:21.393Z","A little bit random","<p>This is one of the many small sets from the adventurers theme, probably my favorite LEGO theme.</p>

<p>It is also the smallest set to include the Pharaoh Hotep minifigure who is definitely the main reason for buying this set. He also carries a red staff with him.</p>

<p>The cart is a very small build and while it looks ok is a bit random. Why is the Pharaoh pushing around a tiny cart with a map and jem on it?</p>

<p>This is a nice little set if you don&#39;t already have the figure but apart from that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the price most are selling for.</p>

<p><strong>Overall rating 3/5</strong></p>
