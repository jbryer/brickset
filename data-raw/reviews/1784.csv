"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-14T09:18:07Z","Great House","I bought this back in April. Altough I'm not a fan of castle sets this hooked me back on LEGO. There are over 600 pcs in it and so I needed around 2 hours for finishing the model. I still wonder, that it costs only 40€ while some other sets of the size cost around 80€.
It's very detailed on only two small Baseplates. The Interior of that two-story house features the blacksmith shop in the lower floor and the living area in the upper one.
The Living area features a great bed, a table, some chairs and even a beer barrel. The facade looks really good with those tudor styled walls. It has even 4 of these walls. Not only 3 like the great town buildings 
of the 80s and 90s or newer. There's only one minor mistake: The scale is wrong to the classic Castle sets, but this doesn't matter.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-13T21:13:12Z","MOC -- now this is a GREAT lego set!","This is just a wonderful lego set.  I wish that Lego would produce more set like this.  It was a little pricey, but there are over 600 pieces...  Scale is a little bit of a problem because, as said earlier, this shop is taller than most lego castles!  But these tiny issues are shaddowed by the amazing qualities of this set.  This is what a lego set SHOULD be -- not that many specialized pieces, so one can really allow his or her imagination to soar by building all sorts of other models.  Overall, this is a wonderful, wonderful set.  If you have a chance to get it, you're crazy if you don't go for it.  Wonderful set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-27T10:12:04Z","Amazing set.","This set is amazing!  The scale is a bit off, sure, but the scale in most LEGO sets is off.  I mean, look at the living quarters in 6074, where the lord and some knights must have lived, to the same-year release of the simple inn 6067!  The inn is huge compared to the Falcons' living area!  This set being out-of-scale is a good thing, I think.  First, it encourages you to make bigger castles, and also(the obvious) it makes it a really detailed set.

The minifigs are my one gripe.  They look too rich to be a blacksmith and his wife.  

For those who complain about price, it was only $40, whereas it cost Dan Siskind several hundred dollars to create.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2007-04-24T19:41:28.407Z","A wonderful set.","Not only the best thing Lego has turned out in years, but one of the greatest Lego sets ever made.  Fabulously detailed both inside and out, the building is hinged in the middle to allow access to the interior, which contains a workshop, bedroom and living area.  What is amazing about this set is the number of pieces.  There is not a sign of juniorisation anywhere, and there is certainly scope for endless alternative building.  Too bad the 'my own creation' line didn't continue.

Wish we would see more of the medievel half-timbered house style. Astounding detail utilizing quality elements.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-28T14:37:02.25Z","worth it for some","My sister actually bought this but i built it and she now gave it to me so i'd say it's mine. For anyone getting that medevil set in 2009 with the cows, they should get it because that' just about the only set that it goes with. On it's own this set is a nice little house and great for those who keep building little house that never have roofs. 
 probably the most charming set I've seen in a while.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

my dark ages.&nbsp; When I saw the level of detail, the piece count and the 
cool figs all for the very reasonable price I HAD to buy it.&nbsp; The 
special three pack with the Legends Guarded Inn and Black Falcon's 
Fortress was a great buy and looking back I am very glad I did.</p><p>The design, colors, parts selection and overall look of the set are very appealing.&nbsp; If I had been slightly younger I am sure the play value would have been very high, and as it stands today the interior detail is enough for me to keep one of my two copies assembled.&nbsp; <br></p><p>I know for a fact this set inspired many multiple castle villages and buildings.&nbsp; For me it re-sparked my interest in castle and LEGO.&nbsp; Thanks to Dan Siskind and LEGO for this fantastic set!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"desser1","2009-11-17T06:17:15.047Z","Outstanding!","When the set came out in 2002 it totally hit me and I had to get one. As a longtime ""Castle"" theme fan I always wanted to build a lattice house but never had enough bricks. This set shows an excellent lattice construction paired with a beutiful roof and very need indoor finish making it a real collector's item.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Ernst","2012-10-10T16:25:27.457Z","Great set, certainly for that year.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : a wonderful set, certainly in perspective of the time it was brought out.

Looking at it, 10 years old now, you wonder &quot;why didn&#39;t I think of this?&quot; Compared with the wonderful MOC&#39;s you see, this looks a very simple set but that is probably the strength of it.&nbsp;The best part of the set is in my view the detailed interior and the good color setting.</span></span></p>

You build 2 opposite sites of the house connected with hinges. The base is the Blacksmiths workshop with a stairway to the first floor. There you find a bedroom and on the other side&nbsp;a living room with a table, chair&nbsp;and a wine barrel. The second floor is a small loft where he hides the treasure box. Back of the house has a chimney for both the fireplace in the workshop and the living space. A great detail is the use of the pillars to stud the ceilings.</span></span></p>

"mediAFOL","2020-09-10T14:09:24.32Z","The joy of interior furnishings","<p>I&#39;d never heard of this set, and my eyes popped when I recently discovered it. It had the immediate appeal of the wonderful half-timbered bookshop from the old <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1592-1/Town-Square-Castle-Scene"">Town Square</a> set, with improbable colour (not least of the roof), which somehow fitted my idealized classic castle aesthetic. A bright blue roof somehow complements a <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57574"">yellow Castle</a>.</p>

<p><img alt=""Blacksmith's shop"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/blacksmith.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 831px;"" /></p>

<p>I found a set, and cannot stress how much I enjoyed the build. The interior gives the impression of a complete living and working space, with workshop, living, and sleeping quarters packed into a building footprint appropriate to minifigure scale.</p>

<p><img alt=""Blacksmith's shop - back"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/blacksmithBack.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 866px;"" /></p>

<p>The logic of the building works in an appealing way, too: both the staircase and the fire and chimney make sense. And the fact that it opens via hinges also places it firmly alongside the <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57574"">yellow Castle</a> in feel.</p>

<p><img alt=""Blacksmith's shop - open, interior"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/blacksmithOpen.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 458px;"" /></p>

<p>A new <a href=""https://brickset.com/article/48873/ideas-review-results"">Ideas blacksmith shop</a> is due out soon. It&#39;s a fabulous model, but it belongs firmly in the more realistic, less idealized MOCking camp. While I love it, It just doesn&#39;t have the naive charm of classic castle.</p>

<p><img alt=""Blacksmith's Shop - side"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/blacksmithSide.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 966px;"" /></p>

<p>For a theme which has so little non-grey architecture, this is an absolutely essential item for classic castle fans. Highly recommended.</p>
