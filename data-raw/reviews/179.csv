"Novelty","2007-07-16T06:21:52.183Z","Kamikaze","Here's the obligatory catapault of the subtheme, with not just one on a cart, but two catapaults on a hand held cart.  Visually, it doesn't look too bad and it seems very well colour coordinated with the minifig.  Design-wise, it's slightly difficult to launch the missiels because too much force and the whole cart goes flying.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-27T02:20:46.247Z","Duel Catapult","This set is really the opposite or the bad of 1186. This one is a bit wider with duel catapults that launch the 1x1 round bricks or the old cannon balls. It also has a katana sticking up to help defend the user from frontal attacks. 

The color scheme is basic baddie ninja in red and black, with a ouch of brown and gray to help with camouflage. The playability is average on its own as you really need an enemy. When combined with 1186 or some other bad guys or added into the whole set its great fun to play with and launch things. 

I must say the catapult system is pretty good as you can easily judge the distance it, will go a good two meters and also in response to someone else's commnet: Of course you have to hold when firing unless you want it to fall at his feet or flip up the model, what do you expect? 

The mini-fig is the standard baddie with black pants, red shirt and green vest, black helmet and the usual face with the mustache and disgusted look.

So overall a good little model that fits in well with the collection and only cost like $2 AU in the day so cant complain there. Make an excellent army builder. I am giving this one a 5/10 because it really has no flaws, but nothing super special either. A great addition to any ninja or castle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This is from the ninja theme, have the function of a catapult, throwing two pieces. It isn't too heavy to a cart, if used to make a creation, can throw more pieces and be greater. The minifigure is cool, different to some ninja, but also included in another sets. It also have the castle theme's wheels, in the same brown color. All the pieces are useful to some themes, the colors too, because this set don't have much them. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
