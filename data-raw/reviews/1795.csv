","Not only is this the most versatile minifig set ever (over 700 pieces, all nicely coloured and fully functional), it has FOURTEEN, yes 14! excellent castle figures!  No castle since then has had more than 12, and these figures are sadly rare.  

The best thing about this set has to be the stickers though, which makes the shields and knights truly spectacular.  Worth buying just for the figures!

Standard yellow-bricks for building, several arches in three sizes, grey plates, and back door and drawbridge make this a set that offers numerous alternative models.  The hinges allow each of the four corners to open adding to the level of playability.  I remember hours of fun setting up the guards and knight attacks against this castle.  Somewhere in the garage, I still have this set with instructions. Lego definately does not make castles/sets like this anymore replacing standard bricks with custom and specialized pieces that only work with the set you're buying.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-22T15:53:46Z","Good start","Finally, after 27 years of wanting one, I won one on eBay. I admired this castle in my youth and always longed to own one. It's a great castle, because of the ordinary bricks, and I think it does get a lot of admiration from everyone because of that (besides of nostalgia). But... I noticed while building this, that the construction is very weak. It looks like a 8 year old decided which bricks should go where, because they are lame connections at several points. This could have been done so much  better. The gate-bridge and the towers stand also very loose and fall apart very easily when you move or bump in to the castle. Furthermore, it was a nice idea with the hinches, but the castle is breaking apart when you lift the set. It's not a very a play-friendl, but more a weak castle. You can clearly see the improvement with the follow-up castle, the 6080. Although I never liked the wall parts that followed, it is a much stronger castle. Legendary figures though with this set. You could really organize a tournament, where other castles focus on one kingdom.
So the 375 is great for having ordinary bricks, it looks fantastic and it was a good start for the theme, but it certainly is not the best Lego castle ever.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-27T09:55:39.593Z","A true legend","This was not the first ever castle set produced, but it was certainly the one that gave way for the successful medieval series.

The design is excellent, with sturdy towers, murderholes, walkways, many arches, a backdoor and a bridge than can be raised/lowered with a winch. The whole castle is built with lots of bricks, not flat walls as in all the following castles series. This means that, if it wasn't for a few rare pieces (the yellow 8x1 arches and tall double-slopes, the discontinued 1x1 windows), this set should be quite easy to recreate.

The castle walls are linked with hinges, and the green baseplate is split in 5, so that the castle can be opened and rearraranged in different shapes. Against a wall it can become a small walled town.

There is a very high number of minifigures included. The helms are done by cleverly reusing space helmets and adding a fantastic-looking visor (near-impossible to find). Horses may not look attractive to a younger audience, but they are very effectively built using basic bricks. Minifigs' vests and shields use stickers, which are provided in extra copies of four different patterns (crown, maltese cross, clubs and stripes), for the builder to choose from; while printed parts would have been better, the stickers look very good and are actually pretty strong, and can survive 30 years with multiple trips in a washing machine (trust me).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Widdi","2014-02-13T21:07:12.553Z","The one, that started it all","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Had no Box with mine, but got it with the original Booklet, but&nbsp;a bit worn from 35 years. The Instructions are very challenging, adding many bricks per step, but still straight forward.</p>

<p>Well the price was quite high for an 35 year old used set, but at 119&euro; , not too overpriced. The newest Lego Castle has more bricks, but less figures and costs around 100&euro;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Mostly simple basic parts, that were around back&nbsp;in it&#39;s days.&nbsp;And all yellow, which isn&#39;t too realistic, but heck that one is from the Late 70s and surely was one of the best Sets around back then. But still had some grey plates inside and the red drawbridge.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Nice Figs, giving the period of time and a whopping 14 of them. This was long before the newer castle Themes. The Horses are all brick built, not the newer one part horses. If you are missing a part&nbsp;or lost it, you can just add Basic bricks in the same Color as replacements.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very Challenging for a rather simple Model. The steps add about 10 times more parts, than today, but you&nbsp;see the Progress. First you are building the main walls, later the submodels: Three towers and the drawbridge.&nbsp; If you want, you can dismantle it and build another Castle or something else from the over 700&nbsp;parts included. On the backside of the box are Alternates, If you don&#39;t care for them, just use your imagination.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great classic, even for city collectors. Not too sturdy, due to the 5 baseplates included,&nbsp;but extremely playable.&nbsp;If you want, you can open the castle and making it looking larger, than it is. When&nbsp;you are removing the&nbsp;Castle&nbsp;minifigs,&nbsp;you can even put it in your Lego city as a historic landmark. This one deserves&nbsp; 5 points.</p>

Little alley's, only suitable for pedestrians; the main gate functioning as an entrance to the main shopping street with its boutiques, restaurants, terraces and pub's.
Think of the yellow walls as a fence that defines the historical borders of your town. Then cram as much interesting buildings as you can within these borders, and you've got yourself a vivid town centre.

"legosforadultstoo","2009-07-07T03:11:40.483Z","My best Christmas present as a child","I had this castle as a present for Christmas when I was a seven-year-old girl and I loved it (I had never been one to conform to stereotypes). It was the best Lego set I ever had (possibly because my parents then refused to buy me more sets as I made too much mess with it). I'd wanted the castle, because I'd been given the Town Square-Castle Scene (set 1592-1 - which I also still have), as my first proper Lego set and had become instantly hooked. This castle seemed like a natural progression from that. I remember it did cause me problems though as I was also into the town part (thanks to the Town Square) and tried to reconcile castle and town together, and don't think I ever managed it properly. 

This castle was great because once I'd grown bored of one castle, there are several others on the box that I used to build just using the picture (although they may not have been as functional - if my memory serves me correctly). 

Eventually parental pressure left its mark and I stopped playing with Lego, but I kept it all. 

Yesterday, I hauled it out from storage (I still have the box), found the instructions online, and rebuilt it! I had kept all of the bricks, other pieces and minifigures. It was still a challenge to build (but that maybe because I'm now a rusty Lego-builder), because it's not always clear which pieces are going where (I think my elder brother may have helped me as a child).

What makes this set brilliant:

It's built entirely of bricks - there are no 'panels' as with later models.
It's fairly complex to build, which makes it fun even as an adult. 
It's pleasing to the eye. 
The castle is functional (although not particularly stable).

Slight downsides:
I do remember the drawbridge tower coming off whenever I tried to put figures on it. 
I remember it was a bit tricky to get the figures into the towers and have them fixed to the floor (and if you just have them resting on the board, they fall down whenever you knock the castle).
The mini-figures all have stickers instead of the symbols being printed on - I'll just use other figures now. 
The horses are made from bricks - but this isn't a problem now because I just use normal horses.  

If you don't have this set, would love to, and don't mind that it's not an authentic set, buy all the bricks you need (I would probably choose grey if I was building this set from scratch), and build it using the instructions online. I think there may be only a few pieces that you'd have to search for (red doors, winder?). 

This castle stands-out for me as the best, because all of the later models were very poor in comparison - they had lost their build-ability and just used panels. 

I now think I was extremely lucky to have been into Lego during its 80s heyday. I bought sets much later on (when I was in my late-20s) when I'd left home, but found them to be very poor in comparison - they were all panels! After having had this castle, where it was all built-up from bricks, I avoid buying the new sets, as they still seem to be quite panel-y. I still want to build a town, but will be creating my own. 

All-in-all, a brilliant set that brought me a lot of happiness.

A great fully original design which can be opened,&nbsp;with 14 minifigures and 4 horses. Very strange and remarkable&nbsp;that this great set, although brought out in the USA 3 years later, never has returned as a Legend. It certainly deserves it.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong>: Building it is a great experience, all small pieces with of course several arches and beams to give it strength. You built from the ground to above, here no loose components yet although the ground plates are split in 5 so you are able to open the Castle thanks to the hinges in the walls. When finished with the walls and the walking boarders&nbsp;you start the building of the rear main tower. This tower has a corridor, just like the 2 smaller towers, and a great window which is constructed with 6 yellow round studs and 6 small red open bricks. Very simple but look fantastic in the yellow tower. The red color returns in the back entrance with the 2 small doors and in the main entrance being a good working drawbridge with a stiil good working reel winch. The side towers, both with corridors, have als 2 open windows on each side. Last job is building the front with the reel upon it to open the drawbridge with an overall great and reasonable solid result. Than finally you have to built the 4 brick horses and assemble the minifigures. Not a Castle for a junior Lego fan, I estimate a minimum age of 8 years.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong>: no real spectacular parts but all chosen very good. Arches in several sizes and the big yellow slopes on the sides are great.

"SirSven7","2012-02-06T17:44:38.83Z","Lego Steve's Review","<p>
 This set was what started it all, over thirty years of love (that we have all experienced) came from the success of this product (take a moment, I know its special). Coming with a very generous number of bricks (767) and figs (14) this set might look basic, but it was actually very exciting for its time.</p>
<p>
 Every minifigs came with a breastplate (though a primitive early version) and we can see a total of four factions, the strongest of which contained eight men (five with axes, 2 with swords and shields, and one knight on a horse) whilst the other three contained only two each (a knight and a squire perhaps?). This set has great versatility, and the numbers of figs make it completely playable just on its own, it&rsquo;s not clear if the six other figs are friends or foes but still it&rsquo;s an interesting minifigs selection (image a set being released now this 6 minifigs as the adversaries).</p>
<p>
 The set was also designed to be opened and the alternative models will have owners building for days, the castle itself features 3 towers, a front gate (which can be pulled up) and a back door (for a quick escape if the castle is overrun).</p>
<p>
 The only flaws with the set are the brick built horse&rsquo;s (I am not a fan) and the fact the castle is yellow, personally I have never been the biggest fan of the brick colour, as it&rsquo;s just not that great (I once made it using white instead of yellow and it looked much better), but again due to that fact that this was the pioneering set, I can&rsquo;t really complain, and the design itself is still very nice.</p>

<p>My building experience for this set is not typical, but rather based on recently buying a huge tub of full classic Lego sets with instructions.&nbsp; Parts were all jumbled together with around 50 other sets.&nbsp; That being said, I&#39;ve never been bothered by the challenge of searching through thousands of parts for that last red window and the building process (although drawn out over many nights of hunting) was very enjoyable.&nbsp; Despite the symmetry of the build, it never feels boring due to the large number of pieces placed in each step.&nbsp; You&#39;re free to vary up the order of piece placement enough to keep it interesting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>Great parts for the time period.&nbsp; Over 700 pieces with a huge quantity of yellow standard bricks to reuse in a city or alter your castle.&nbsp; Not too many unique pieces, but enough to give it character.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Thinking back to my childhood days in the early 80s, we alternated quite a bit between castles and modern cities.&nbsp; I don&#39;t recall this set being rebuilt exactly as is back then, but if it had stayed together, I would have spent endless hours waging wars within its walls.&nbsp; 14 minifigures provides an excellent source of playability as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>I believe it sold for around $50 in 1980 which would be about $150 today.&nbsp; This seems pretty reasonable given the number of pieces, the number of minifigures, and the gradual drop in adjusted price per piece.&nbsp; Also considering a used set is now worth about $150, you could have bought this in 1980, sold it in 2018, and had 40 years of free play with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Overall</strong></h2>

<p>An important historic set with a build that still holds your attention in my opinion.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t have a lot of variety of pieces, but the completed structure looks good.&nbsp; The yellow coloring never bothered me either.&nbsp; A quick search for yellow castles on google will show some real life examples.</p>

<p>Tons of minifgures and, although fragile, the visors always looked better to me than later incarnations.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend this to anyone looking for a classic set to build and display.&nbsp; Based on the age and value as a collectable, I don&#39;t think it would be a good play set for younger kids in particular.</p>

<p>Of course, I then sold the lot as a teenager. I regret that to this day, though &pound;50 was a lot of money in the late Eighties. Also, the boy to whom I sold it all had lost all his Lego in a fire, so it went to a good place. I hope he enjoyed it.</p>

<p>So the yellow castle held a place in my heart all these years. Once our children started to have a little Lego themselves, my memory grew stronger. I eventually did my best to make a BOLOC of this set, which I enjoyed, but it made me realize that consistent colours were more important to me now than they were when I was a child. The enjoyment was all in the build, and certainly not in the display, as it was migraine-inducing.</p>

<p>I bit the bullet and bought a near-complete set, and loved building it properly once more. What surprised me was the powerful nostalgia which the figures triggered in me. I had forgotten how much I loved the different chivalric crests on the knights gathered for a tournament.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a wonderful set. The hinged walls were a novelty at the time, though I never really liked opening it up, and still don&#39;t. We all have our Lego opinions, and I, like many, drifted away from Lego when prefab pieces started to appear (from memory, it was in classic space sets). The phrase &quot;modern build techniques&quot; is thrown around a lot to patronize the quality of old sets. I&#39;d argue it&#39;s often not modern techniques, but the vastly increased number of pieces which allows for modern models. This set had none of that, but still absolutely shines. I prefer Lego like that, as opposed to today&#39;s &quot;a part for everything&quot; approach.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve no love for moulded animals, either. The horses in this set are hardly the most accomplished of models, but again, my nostalgia forgives a lot.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth mentioning that the box photos of alternate builds were always beguiling. I purchased my replacement without box, but from online scans, and <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/laz75/16178890488/in/album-72157650470116751/"">photos from another AFOL</a>, I managed to build one of these. It&#39;s actually the model I&#39;ve stuck with, rather than the main build - the height of the hefty keep towers better above more modern civilian buildings.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it&#39;s just brought me a huge amount of pleasure to regress to the start of my childhood passion for Lego. If I&#39;d not been given this set, and if it hadn&#39;t been made up entirely of plain, and hence reusable, bricks, I probably wouldn&#39;t have had the childhood love of Lego which still brings me so much pleasure. Inevitably, of course, it&#39;s not quite as big as I remember...</p>
