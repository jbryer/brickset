This is one of the best Lego carriages I have seen since the 80's, although I will probably stick to buying 
Santa-Fe carriages rather than more of these.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It also reminds me of the trains in Lucky Luke, and it looks cool together with western sets like 6769. It contains a lot of green windows with trans-blue glass (I wish they were trans-white (clear)). I only got one of this set, but I'm going to buy two more together with one 10014. Well done Lego!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set is an amazing addition to the Holiday Train that my wife bought for me last Christmas '06 because of the red and green colors. I wish I had more of this set to run with the engine from the Holiday Train. The train windows are by far the hardest parts for me to build up a collection of to make more of this model to create a line of trains in this design. Fortunately there are the other square train windows that I do own a few of to make a train passenger car similar to this one but in blue. I know that this set was included in a large set but in blue and I hope to add this set to my collection one day. 

LEGO trains are a newer fascination of mine and I love that they are self propelling when attached to an engine. I will miss the 9v train line. Anyone interested in buying the Holiday or Hobby Trains, go now to LEGO.com because they are 50% off.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
