"Novelty","2007-07-16T06:18:48.06Z","Ohio Gozaimasta","This set seems to have been copied from the pirates theme, but it improves on it a lot.  The design is basically the same as that of the flier (1187), but the colours here (red and brown) works nicely.  The attached crossbow and the paddle increase the play value of the set and the black ninja goes very well with the set in terms of colours.  This set doesn't seem like parts thrown together.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-04T07:57:25.093Z","The River's Secret","This was another one of those sweet models I found to Coles supermarkets which were over priced but this particular one was so worth it.

The raft itself looks quite cool with spears on either side, a mounted bow and arrow, with a paddle used for a rudder.

The mini-fig is a standard Ninja, in all black and standard Ninja face. 
No flaws with this model as you would expect due to its size.

Overall its an excellent little model that fits in well with the whole ninja theme. Personally I'm a big ninja fan, so I may be a little bias, but I promise I'm trying not to be. This model has great aesthetics and although on its own has little playability, when added in with any other from the series it increases tenfold. I feel this model is a solid 5/10 and although small makes an excellent addition to any Ninja set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The building of the raft looks like very with a flyer of the same theme. This can be used as a flyer too , and it is useful to any themes, like the plate of it, that is really a wall, used too on the western sets. This is a small set, but don't deserves a small rate, it have a function to increase pieces or minifigures, or be used in a creation and it can do that. The minifigure is a ninja with black details, very included in the theme, if with another ninja sets, is easy to make a patrol, or an army with these. Another features are the spears and the longbow putted on it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
