"shenron","2007-12-27T09:09:23.2Z","Basic nice house design","This old set would be perfect as a starter for creating houses and other town buildings, because it is quite basic but has more or less everything you would expect from a proper house design: simple furniture (a kitchen and a livingroom), roof pieces, and great old-style windows with shutters.

An extra positive aspect of this set is that the house walls have hinges, hence the two halves can be closed or kept open (as shown in the box picture), depending on the preferences. The green baseplate is actually in two pieces.

The garden is nicely rendered, with a fireplace, a tree, lots of flowers and some furniture. The downside is that the furniture of both the house and the garden is very blunt and could have benefitted from using chairs instead.

Another downside is the use of stickers for the sunscreen, which would have been great if they had been printed. There is also a sticker for a 2x1 brick to create a small tv.

The alternative models suggested are even smaller but certainly nice, and include two cottages (one with a water well), a flower booth, and a stable with red cows.

The moderately rare piece to look for is the red arch.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"StormSworder","2008-12-29T20:30:49.92Z","A timeless classic.","This was the year in which Lego Town became a defined range, also started the trend of Lego minifigs with pre-printed faces, moving arms and legs and hands which could hold things.  This house is just beautiful, has a very quaint old-fashioned look to it.  It comes with furniture such as chairs, tables and a sun lounger for the garden, even features a sink with a tap (a piece which I think never featured in more recent sets).  There are nice little touches, such as the archway in the garden wall and the sloped roof.  The clever hinge mechanism (which seems to have made a come-back with lego buildings in recent years) allows you to open the house up and re-arrange the insides.  A lovely set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-11T21:27:47.793Z","The word 'neolithic' comes to mind","Although charming, this house suffers from the fact that it was the first of its kind. All the right ideas were there: the furniture, a fireplace and the watertap with sink. But all these ornaments are quite crude in their appearance.
The colour scheme could have been more subtle as well; with two colours contrasting as sharply as red and blue, I would really have made an effort of using a third colour to act as a buffer between the other two.
With the subsequent designs, clear improvements were made on all these points. Thus, on the evolutionary ladder this house really stands on the rung where it belongs: the first.
What I do like about this set is the bent roof. It gives this set a very distinctive look and the two types of sloped bricks provide countless possibilities for alternate models",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-06-04T07:56:53.263Z","a good start!","This was the first house with minifigs, also the start of a new lego era. I loved the way you can use the hinges to look into the house or just enlarge it to pretend it to be twice as wide ;) 

This set has some lovely details, water crane, tv, a living room. Its nice in colour scheme and has lots of flowers - i am not sure if there ever was a set with more flowers. Get it if you can!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
