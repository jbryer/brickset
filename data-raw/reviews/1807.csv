It came with a large variety of basic bricks, coloured red, yellow, white, blue, green, and black. It also came with two minifigures, including elements for building cars, houses, and almost any creation you want.&nbsp;Accessories such as flags, whip, umbrellas, goblets, chairs, and even a broomstick were also included. Plant pieces&nbsp;consisted of bushes, flowers, and&nbsp;weeds. A large baseplate is also included.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I remember being very happy when I finally had green 1x1 bricks to build a traffic light with, and not have to use a flower stem for the green light.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the same brick tub is filled with a whole variety of pieces from random sets. All original pieces are still&nbsp;around but are either in use or too worn down to use.</p>
<p>As a young child back then, a single brick tub was enough to satisfy my play and enjoyment. However, today, brick buckets do not interest me as my creations require very specific pieces that would not be included in general brick buckets. Nonetheless, this was a great set for when I was younger. If&nbsp;the set still existed, I would recommend it to all younger audiences.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
