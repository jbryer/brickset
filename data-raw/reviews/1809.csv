"Nuke","2008-12-20T19:19:25.997Z","Nice one old set","I have recently (re)discover my old lego bricks, and i have rebuild this nice service station.
Is simple and easy to build, the service station has a small shop inside, with a cash and a small trasparent piece used as bottle.
Unfortunately the car cannot be used by minifig, and is not really in scale, but is a good set, nice pieces (for the time...) and i remember a lot of fun playing with it.

"CamberbrickGreen","2013-03-21T06:23:40.357Z","Fuelbreak","In the days of service at fuel stations your mum or dad used to pay through the window, unless purchasing from the small store and the staff member would give them the change from a bag having pumped the car full of two star or four star fuel. The heady fully leaded scent of petroleum used to drift in and make kids happily sedated while they waited. The relationship between TLG and Shell goes back a long way it seems and the ties between the oil and plastic industry could possibly point toward shared business interests.&nbsp;<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>The rarer Shell uniforms look really great for an old fuel station.</li></ul>In these days women had to be differentiated with hair and so she loses out on the red cap but gets black pigtails (was this typically Danish??). Many cars of this period held as many minifigures as you could imagine. That is, if the only people included are staff then that solidly bricked car must contain the driving customer and possibly an entire family?</div><div><br></div><div><div><b>Shell Smart</b></div><div>Despite misgivings about promoting any commercial venture through a kid's toy, the range of Shell sets were fortunately smart and represented a common fuel and corporate sponsor of the age. The Shell sponsored Lego cars are often excellent. In my humble opinion I found the recent Toys'R'Us promoted set and <i>that</i> McDonald's restaurant more troubling as these are directly targeted at children while what preference could a child show a giant oil company? Enough with the social and environmental questions, that's what the article comments sections are for!</div><div><br></div><div>An appreciably basic car of the family sort features with a roof rack and items that suggest a holiday is the purpose for travel - a blue cylinder and yellow brick, gas cylinder and picnic hamper anyone? I'm never personally keen on that early chrome headlights and grill print brick but the black slants are nice on the back and this is typical 1970's vehicle fare.</div><div><br></div><div>So this smart station rises up out of a straight road baseplate, much appreciated with any larger or Town set. Its yellow and red stripes grow an open backed building, four petrol pumps no less, a spare tyre column and pump shelter. Predominantly white the building also has a suitably black door, windows and hatch area as well as a built cash register. Various one stud bricks in red and transparent are added as drinks and products but I can not tell what the black plates by the door are for, tripping up customers? The long red roof and pump shelter with overhanging yellow border, topped in white both look excellent and the added one tree just brings an alternative colour and much needed organic element to the scene.</div></div></div><div><br></div><div>The pumps themselves contain the interesting element of a two stud brick with one cylindrical corner that allows a string to hang out of it and snap directly into the bricks beneath, unless our set is missing something? The Shell symbol is of course on the pump brick and sticker that goes on to the pump shelter, all matching nicely with those uniforms. The window to read the pump info on is unfortunately one larger transparent brick so rather than imagining a display on one side it appears more like fuel is going to swish about inside the window but this is a small area for improvement. The spare tyres sit nicely on their post for yet more service and with the Shell company banner in a large sign on top (now a worn sticker!) the station is complete. Incidentally I think that trip up inside the door requires a sticker we may likely not possess, perhaps it is a tool box?</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Petrol Fumes</b></div><div>This is by no means the most comprehensive or accurately thought out fuel stop TLG have made but where there are is a something lacking, such as the pump design, there is loads of charm to make up for it. Always worth mentioning is the less flashy, printed and bespoke parted a set is, the more room there is for imagination so it scores high as many 1970's sets would for child play and development. Representing a bygone age of cheap fuel with direct service to the vehicle, this is a good all rounder and with the uniforms surely a popular old Town element.</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
"meowq","2011-12-31T16:37:42.8Z","I fun addition to any town set","<p>I had this set as a boy and I really quite liked it. I most liked the road plate that came with it. Although, I was never too keen on the female&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;for some reason. It was fun and easy to build. I&nbsp;kept the plans for it and would occasionally reconstruct it from the general&nbsp;Lego bin I kept all my Lego bricks in. &nbsp;I put all the stickers on the pieces and never took them off, including the large sign on the roof. After a while, the stickers got a bit battered.</p><p>One thing I didn't like about this set was the car. I was disapointed that a Minifig could not ride in it. </p><p>Recently, I opened up my Lego bin I'd kept all these years to see if all the Lego sets I had as a child were still in the bin and complete. Sure enough, this set is still 100 percent complete, including the large sign on the roof and the string pumps. -- Fun stuff.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"peti7788","2021-12-15T23:29:11.773Z","The first gas station with minifigures","<p>Exceptionally, there is no US version of this set. It was only marketed in Europe.&nbsp;From then on, until the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6397-1/Gas-N-Wash-Express"" target=""_blank"">Octan brand gas station</a> appeared, completely different gas stations were sold in Europe and America.&nbsp;The <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6378-1/Shell-Service-Station"" target=""_blank"">Dutch Shell</a> remained in Europe and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6375-2/Exxon-Gas-Station"" target=""_blank"">Exxon</a> in North America.</p>

<p>How simple, yet how cool this set is!&nbsp;I&rsquo;m not a petrol head, but I&rsquo;ve always liked sets that are accessories for cars.&nbsp;The good thing about these early sets is that they use regular bricks, there are plenty of rebuilding options.&nbsp;Therefore, parts are also readily available.</p>

<p>There are no special parts. There&rsquo;s the baseplate, for example: a smooth, straight road.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>The hair and cap of the figures are still from the &quot;statue figure&quot; era.&nbsp;There is still a sticker on the torso of the figures, the logo is not printed.</p>

<h3>Shop&nbsp;building</h3>

<p>It&#39;s pretty simple, but the color combination is good. The color of the brand fits exactly into the basic colors of the lego, they didn&#39;t have to mix a new color.&nbsp;The extra wall at the back I didn&#39;t get it, it doesn&#39;t have many functions, for fencing is good maybe.&nbsp;However, there is a spare tire and cash register.&nbsp;And there are a few items on the shelf that you can buy.</p>

<h3>Car</h3>

<p>I have mixed feelings about the car. On the one hand, I like the roof rack, a good idea!&nbsp;On the other hand, unfortunately it is not possible to include minifigures, which is a pity, especially since minifigures were added to the set. This reduces the gaming experience.</p>

<h3>My mod</h3>

<p>I rebuild&nbsp;the car a bit to fit at least 1 minifigure.&nbsp;It reminds me of the VW Golf / Rabbit with sunroof, which was quite common in the late 1970s.</p>
