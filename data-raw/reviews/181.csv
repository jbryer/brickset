"Novelty","2007-07-16T06:14:59.17Z","Banzai!","This is an interesting small little cart.  The nice points - it's hand held, it's nicely balanced, it has a screen that's not totally opaque and it has nice colours (blue and grey and white) that matches the minifig.  The Katana construction could have been better, but the way its done also works, as the minifig can then simply unsnap the swords out of the brackets to be used in a fight.  What seems weird is the golden antlers on the minifig - but that's a minor complaint.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-20T05:30:32.06Z","Shogun's Cart","This is another one of those little carts that were so prominent during the ninja series. They are a great addition and add much playability.

This particular cart is Shogun's cart and is pretty good for a cheap model. It is built solid and the handles are exactly at the right hight unlike other carts I own. The cart has a pair of katanas on the front which mean you don't want to get in front of it. It also has a set of bars to protect the user from a frontal attack but allowing him to see where he is going. The color scheme is nice too, the white blue and gray work well together. 

The mini-fig is shogun in the usual full Japaneses armor with the gold horns in the helmet and the white face paint on.

Overall I really like this set as I was a big Ninja fan and it made a great way to expand the collection, army or game without it being too costly. I give this one a 6/10 and recommend it to anyone is a castle or ninja fan.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-25T14:22:22.623Z","Another cart of this theme","This is my second review of carts in the ninja theme, but many were included on previous themes... This have a different minifigure, with blue armors, and the cart is too different, don't have the function of a catapult, but have two katanas and a brown piece that can be used as a window of a prision or a part of a stair. Another useful things are the wheels, included in some themes, if with some other carts, is easy to make a bigger vehicle. The helmet of the minifigure is also different in comparision with the included in the other ninja cart. This is small, but too usable to creations, it is great if in a low price. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
