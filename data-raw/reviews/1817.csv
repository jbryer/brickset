"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-12T19:05:07Z","One of a kind","The only Bus Station set released and one of only two Town public transport sets, the other being the Airport Shuttle.  A set with huge play value, it came with a bus seating three passengers, a ticketing booth, covered shelter and a bus schedule to ensure services ran on time.  Though it's a set that doesn't get the recognition it deserves, it's a must have for anyone looking to add an extra dimension to their town layout.  An interesting sidenote about this set and an example of the attention to detail of early Town theme designers is the red and white colour scheme of the bus became the default livery for the next two transport vehicles, 6392 (Airplane) and 6399 (Monorail).

"shenron","2007-12-27T18:30:10.89Z","Mixed results","There is good and bad within this town set.

The bus station itself is solid design: a ticket office with backdoor and shutters, a simple bench under a roof, a timetable and a necessary clock.

Having a roadplate included is a big plus, and the set include some simple but nice additions to fill the other side of the road (great streetlamp, poor bench doesn't properly allocate minifigures).

The bus is the only thing that does not really look good. The front has no lamps for instance, the sides have no windows whatsoever, and the interior has a weird separator. On the other hand, it has even too many doors (never seen a bus where passengers can exit directly into the middle of the street). Interesting however the use of house windows in the bus, which anyway at least manages to carry 3 passengers, which is not few considering the limited size.

"sijpe","2008-07-11T23:08:31.28Z","Still waters run deep","At first sight this set has got no sex-appeal at all. And that is most likely the reason that, after this set, the whole concept of legoland public transport has been thrown out the window. Which, in hindsight, is a bloody shame of course.

From an architectural perspective this set has some nice features like the panoramic window and the overlapping flat roof which gives the (otherwise plain) building its depth. The lamp-post and the bench stand as a testimony to the fact that the lego designers, in those days, had a far better grasp of the importance of having these mundane little details in a town.

The real strength of this set, however, is its ability to weld all the individual components of your town together and give it a feel of credibility. With the bus-station next to the train-station and a bus-stop near the hospital for example, you'll create a very effective link between these buildings even if they're on opposite sides of your town.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This bus station has not only a quite good number of windows which you can use for other buildings, it gives also a good detail to your city. This set brings back sweet memories. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I think there could be more detail like another bus and moremini-figures and maybe even a lemenade stand. :-) If I were to see this set I would get it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In it self it's a nice set that comes complete with it's own (32x32 road/baseplate), 4 minifg some nice street features (Tree, Lamp, bench, flowers and roadsign). The building itself is simple but does the trick. (It's made in a way that it seems bigger than it is). And the included&nbsp;bus&nbsp;actually fits&nbsp;3 minifig (incl. the driver) which is great for the relative age of the set. </p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The busschedule, clock, tree, flowers, lamppost, the bus&nbsp;stop traffic sign... all lovely details that make this set great.&nbsp;Even the simple, one traveler only-bus can&#39;t change that.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>4 in total, not bad.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Rather easy, but nice. Lego managed to make a great looking little station with a little amount of bricks and a clever use of windows. The bus is rather limited but they could not really have made it any other way I guess.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Just beautiful, fits perfectly in any city. Especially since it is already sitting on a road plate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Loved this set, not so much for playability but for it&#39;s looks and great parts. After this set and later on, I wondered many times why Lego stopped adding trees and flowers to their City sets.</p>

"peti7788","2022-01-04T08:45:55.713Z","The next stop will be Legoland","<p>Very charming set! Simple build, basic parts=fun! I think this is the&nbsp;first ever public transport set, with minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>I like the building, although I&rsquo;m not a big fan of stickers.&nbsp;Everything is here: street lamp, bench, flowers, pine tree.&nbsp;Excellent even after 40 years. If you don&rsquo;t have this set, but you like it, you can pretty much build it from today&rsquo;s modern parts, except for the old road&nbsp;baseplate.&nbsp;Unfortunately, &quot;time stopped&quot; on the roof&nbsp;clock. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GncQtURdcE4"">Bill Murray</a> could tell you about this. So if you don&rsquo;t want to miss the bus, you better watch the time on your own watch.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>Everyone smiles as they go to Legoland. (<em>bus destination sticker</em>) One of the ladies is not good at going to the hairdresser.&nbsp;The bus driver seems very patient, probably still a beginner or hasn&#39;t worked in a big city yet.&nbsp;However, I would fire the bus company&#39;s marketer,&nbsp;let&#39;s look at the ticket seller,&nbsp;blue suit with red pants and hat?! (:</p>

<h3>Bus</h3>

<p>&nbsp;This is the one I don&#39;t like. It&rsquo;s too complicated compared to what it can do.&nbsp;And it looks more like buses from the 50s than buses from the late 70s.&nbsp;I think it would have been better if the color of the bus was different than that of the building, because that way everything is too red.&nbsp;Let&#39;s say blue.</p>

<h3>My mod</h3>

<p>I built another bus.&nbsp;Check this out: it can already capable more than 2&nbsp;passengers!&nbsp;Yet I made it from the very basic parts available in 1979, so I didn&rsquo;t cheat on anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The articulated bus was quite common in the 1970s. Mainly in Europe and North America. (for example: GMC, Volvo, MAN, Ikarus)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I haven&#39;t solved the doors yet, but at least that&rsquo;s easier for passengers to get in.</p>

<p>I know Lego hasn&rsquo;t officially made an articulated bus yet. (2021) Not even an in ideabooks.</p>
