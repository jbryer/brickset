"Novelty","2007-07-16T06:12:22.983Z","Sayonara","Can anyone imagine a ninja flying with a wall strapped to his back?  The design just seems horrible although the concept is nice.  It could probably be done with a sleeker design on the back to attach the wings to.  The design also excludes the use of the spears while &quot;in flight&quot;.  The colours selected for the backpack - blue and brown, doesn't seem to look good at all.  Idea = great, execution = lousy.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-25T17:34:10.61Z","Ninja Glider","This is another small set of the theme of ninjas, this is a glider, the ninja carries it and uses it to fly. The glider is made with pieces of the western wall with the brown color, black wings and other small pieces like little blue plates, have also spears on it's back. The ninja have gray details, and this can be finded easy on another ninja sets. The building is easy, and it likes to the raft to the same theme, but have another forms to build it and is easy to mix it, many children can do that. This is a classic because includes a ninja minifigure, now, hard to find. The playability is basic, due to the size, small. In overall, in comparision with small sets, this i rate 5/5.

"Blade","2008-04-30T02:19:05.343Z","Ninja Flight!","I originally lost one of the black spears, so this model spent a bit of time incomplete, but I found a spare one I had recently acquired so now it is complete and ready for review.

This is one of my more favourite Ninja miniatures many due to the colour scheme. It is a ninja with a flying glider. The glider is brown, blue and black. The glider is equipped with two spears and the mini-fig clips on quite nicely. Although the pack seems bulky, it is meant to be that way. Gliders now a days are sleek and aerodynamic, this is based on 16th century Japan. Not going to be that light small or effective, but still really cool.

The mini-fig is the standard grey ninja with mask. His face is the one with the grey headband. Most of my grey ninja come with the light grey sword, but this one comes with a black one, making him that little bit more special.

Overall it's a great little set especially if you were a ninja fan like me as it was a perfect army builder for about $3AU. The aesthetics aren't perfect buy today's standards but for what it is meant to represent i feel it's excellent. Looks great on display and adds a bit more to the rest of the ninja collection. I feel this model is a 6/10 or Above Average and a must for any Ninja fan or a good one for Castle fans.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"TheMaster","2009-05-23T06:47:49.64Z","A great army builder!","For 3$Aud this was a great way to create an army of grey ninjas! However the set does not have much playability on its own and needs to be combined with other ninja sets.

Overall I rate this set a 4/3 and it is an ideal set if you plan to build a ninja army and can still find this set cheap on Bricklink or Ebay.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"ninbricks","2017-09-13T15:43:25.83Z","Let your imagination soar high","<p>Back in 1999 I found that little set in a small shop in northern Germany. As a kid I was a fan of LEGO and of martial arts movies like the Bruce Lee-movies or &quot;Ninja Commando&quot;, so that set was a nice fusion to me, and a definite must-have for my little collection.</p>

<p>The minifigure is very well designed with that knife and shuriken printing, and the dark-grey color-scheme really suits him well. I like this version a lot better than the clich&eacute; black-colored ones.</p>

<p>The glider really is not that big hit when it comes to it&#39;s design. But it brings you some good parts for your own ideas. So combined with some of your spare parts, the brown parts can quickly turn into a small raft, and the wings can turn into a more realistic-sized glider.</p>

<p>Again, this is what makes LEGO so special to me - you get material for your own imagination. And when you are good at imagining, then you have ten thousand ways to enjoy this little set! Ganbatte kudasai!!</p>
