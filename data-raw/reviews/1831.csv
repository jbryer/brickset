Then I think of all the times that I had to clean the wheels.

Pros:
The wheels move very well, when their not jammed.
Very reliable, well put together.

Cons:
Hair has this annoying knack of getting stuck in the wheels!
The wheels are really hard to put together.

Sorry for complaining about the hair so much, I really can't do anything about it, thats just what happens!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
