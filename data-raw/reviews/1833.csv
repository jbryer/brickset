I fight virtual battles against my other spybot, the gigamesh.  I even fought a real battle against my friend's spybot with it once.  I like how the body is put together, and the overall looks of it.

Pros:
-Very good looking
-Programmable remote
-Creative claw design
-Dose'nt need many batteries, only 3 AA
-Drives well

Cons:
-Claws are more decoration than weapons, although they are good for grabbing light things which dont move.
-WARNING: DONT DRIVE NEAR MAGNETS! ! ! I drove mine near one once, and it messed up the motors so that one side turns faster than the other, and it messes up all the electronics and everything! ! ! ! 

8/10, for a well put together little droid",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
