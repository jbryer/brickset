"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-27T12:19:35Z","Best Police Station","This wasn't by first police station, but definately my favorite. This is a classic and introduced moveable mini-figs, a great new window color combination, some nice police marked bricks/doors, and clear blue round 1x1s. The helicopter, squad car, and motorcycle are definately some of the best police vehicles made over the years, esp. the cycle (and the car actually fits 2 figs!).  The jail in the back added to the fun with single yellow bench inside.  Also the desks with red phones inside added to the detail.  I had a lot of fun with this set and the new &quot;Minority Report&quot; police station doesn't even come close with all of its fancy new specialized pieces.  Lego should go back to sets like this.  They really are a lot more fun!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I loved that it had an office for the guy in blue, and a jail cell.  I added the van to the fleet because the car that comes with the set was a bit lame.  Excellant set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-28T03:19:31.03Z","Not fancy but effective and good-looking","This old police station set is designed in a very functional way, with not much fancyness, but the overall look is quite good thanks to a nice selection of colors. 

The baseplate is a simple straight road (high reusability). The building has two floors and three rooms, two of which are offices and one is a prison cell (the fence used as a prison window looks more brilliant than the bars in recent sets). In the centre, a double garage with transparent doors host a police car and a motorbike, separated by a low wall with a water tap. The roof is used as a landing site for the helicopter, at a realistic distance from the building upper office, with blue lights and yellow stripes for visibility.

The back of the station is open for playability (except the prison cell which is totally closed). The furniture inside is a bit minimalistic but not bad, and includes a funny red telephone. The building has 3 doors, and 3 windows with yellow frame, black glasses, and green shutters.

With the exception of the car, the vehicles are well done. The motorbike predates the one-piece bikes of later years and is built with small pieces: it looks quite ok, but could have been better. The small helicopter is very nice, although it doesn't open frontally like other models (but do helicopters usually need to open frontally?). The car instead is not well done, it's too blunt, doesn't have lamps, and oddly for a police vehicle it is a convertible.

A couple of the finishing touches are definitely nice, particularly the blue signs at the door, the acoustic alarm on top of the roof, and the small phone booth (although an opening one would have been great), but it looks like there would have been room for more.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-05-15T06:00:46.92Z","Friendly police station","If you want some nice police in your friendly lego city, this is your set. The colour scheme with white, black, green and yellow is great, lego changed it to black/blue/white soon which might be more realistic but hey, i have enough realism when i look out of the window. The vehicles of course seem to be odd compared to those produced two years later, but this is still the childhood of the minifig and due to that fact, its a great set with lots of playability. Two office rooms, a jail and a landing place for the copter - enough to play with. Some transparent blue parts which were hard to find back in those days, details added like a tree, a lantern and a little phone cell in front of the house. Great set, 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mcjaco","2016-03-04T21:16:48.24Z","My First Town Set","<p>I&#39;ve recently brought out my original collection of Legos, as my kids are getting into them. This was the second set I received as a kid (Coast Guard was first), and thus was the first one my kids wanted built too. &nbsp;It was great re-build that brought back many memories!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions were straight forward. &nbsp;I recall not having any issues building the set even as a five year old, back in the day. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The frosted glass doors are a cool feature (I&#39;ve managed to misplace one!). &nbsp;Otherwise the typical parts in early Town sets. &nbsp;Lots of transparent blue lights pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four figures. &nbsp;Two Officers with helmuts&nbsp;for their motorcyle and helicopter respectively. &nbsp;One normal officer, and one desk jockey.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build was straight forward. &nbsp;The center column was a little &quot;challenging&quot; as it sits on the street rather than plate studs. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Completed model is still one of the better looking Police Department sets I&#39;ve seen over the years, and functional, with two offices, a &quot;garage,&quot; a jail, and a helipad.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My kids love this set. &nbsp;I believe Carnage is holed up in the jail, which was (and still is) my major complaint about this set. &nbsp;It&#39;s not open in the back, but is accessed through a door and it&#39;s unwieldy getting minifigs in and out of it without tearing the helipad off. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I love the roof details, the roof walkway, and the little sink in the garage. &nbsp;This set had everything to get a kid hooked in one set. &nbsp;Two offices with desks and printed telephones, the garage, the jail, and three vehicles. &nbsp;The Helicopter does not yet feature the lift up roof so dismantling is needed to get the pilot in and out. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s pure Lego Town at it&#39;s infancy, and it&#39;s wonderful!</p>

"Niki124","2021-02-02T22:13:41.13Z","The centrepiece of my childhood Lego collection","<p>This was THE ONE. The main Christmas present one year (my sister received the corresponding fire station), which Dad and I built together on Christmas Day afternoon. I loved the detail - the jail cell with its plain bed, the telephones, the sink &amp; tap unit on the centre console between the garages - and the vehicles had enough space for all the minifigures. And a real road baseplate!</p>

<p>I spent hours playing with this, even insisting the shutters be closed every night and reopened every morning. Some months later, the images of alternative buildings on the instructions became too tempting and the station was broken up to be rebuilt as two more modest buildings facing each other across the road. This was soon broken up to be rebuilt as two other different buildings. And again, and again.</p>

<p>The vehicles were great, too. The motorbike (still in the pre-moulded era, so the handlebars would often fall off) had room for a pillion passenger if you sat them correctly. The helicopter had real opening doors, as did the police car - which could fit a third (or even a fourth) figure inside if the others didn&#39;t mind squashing up a bit. Perfect for our Lego vehicle convoys across the carpet.</p>
