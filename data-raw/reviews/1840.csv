It could have been better if it was in stop motion form, but Lego doesn't do that. Don't waste your time on this.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"f_man","2008-07-11T21:48:44.2Z","Ugh...","Puh-lease. The ones who received this VHS should throw it away. Such a waste of time. 
I got this for free and wished I hadn't. Good thing it &quot;Stragely Disappeared&quot; from my video closet.

Pros:
None

Cons:
Waste of time for LEGO!
Waste of time for ME!

<p>However, now that I am a few years older, it does not bring the thrills it originally did.&nbsp; I&nbsp;still might enjoy it to a certain extent, but the&nbsp;great excitement it brought&nbsp;was not lasting.</p>
<p>As for a recommendation, I would say get it as cheap as you can.&nbsp; Anyone under the age of&nbsp;10 might find this amusing; &nbsp;I&nbsp;know I certainly did.&nbsp; For&nbsp;anyone over the age of&nbsp;10, I&nbsp;would&nbsp;really not bother watching it unless you have&nbsp;the&nbsp;time, and have an, shall we say,&nbsp;interesting sense of humor (like I do!)&nbsp; I&nbsp;will probably watch&nbsp;it again for&nbsp;nostalgic reasons.&nbsp;</p>
