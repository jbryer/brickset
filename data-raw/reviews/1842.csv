It's a really 
cool minifig to have as a key chain but the only problems I have with 
those is that you're not able to take off the legs, the head or the 
headgear.<br></p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul><li>Minifig looks cool
</li></ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul><li>Legs, head and/or headgear don't come off<br></li></ul>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p></div></div></div>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
