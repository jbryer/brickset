Can't really play with it and don't want to risk losing it by putting to use as intended. Some folks collect them and I'm sure they would rate it much higher than myself.

It's a really 
cool minifig to have as a key chain but the only problems I have with 
those is that you're not able to take off the legs, the head or the 
headgear.<br></p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul><li>Minifig looks cool
</li></ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul><li>Legs, head and/or headgear don't come off<br></li></ul>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p></div></div></div></div>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
