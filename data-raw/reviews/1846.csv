"ogel3001","2012-12-16T14:17:14.477Z","Red Brick Key Chain.","<p>We got this free, so that's why I've given it five bricks in value for money. Building experience didn't get high marks because there's nothing to build on to except the logo tile.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Classic brick style.<br></li><li>It couldn't get as damaged as character key-chains. (We had a Harley Quinn key-chain and her face and torso wore away.)<br><br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>there are no cons.<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a good long lasting key-chain to buy.</p>",TRUE,2,2,1,1,5
