BUT i had a horrible experience with it, unfortunately. about 3 years ago i decided to attach it to my keys, just because it would be nice, i thought. 
the very next day i had to cross a big street quickly, and my quite big bunch of keys jumped out of my pocket. i only realised it when i needed it half an hour later, went back to that street, just to find that in the mean time about 400 cars had rolled over my keys...! they were spread all over the asphalt, and when the traffic lights for pedestrians went green, i tried to collect as much as i could.
i had to do it several times. luckily i found most of the keys, heavily scratched and bent, but that coast girl remained lost forever (ok, meanwhile i bought another one).

i still blame her for that incident. since then i never again attached a lego-keychain to my bunch of keys, i just don't trust them anymore. frailty, thy name is woman!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
