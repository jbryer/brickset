The parts are all glued together and the chain won't come out of his head, If LEGO had made it so you could take him off this would have served not only as a nice key-ring, but as a way for Star Wars lego fans to get their hands on this rare mini figure. Also, as a last note the figure has a LEGO lego on his back.</div><div><br></div><div>However, it's a nice, well-made, good looking key-ring, and that was what it was made for.</div><div>I recommend it if you've ordered something else and have Â£2-3 to spare, Hope it helps!</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,2,1,1,3
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-06-03T07:11:45.863Z","LEGO Gear (Key Chains/Star Wars) - Darth Maul Key Chain Review","<div class=""description""><div class=""description""><div class=""description""><div class=""description""><div class=""description""><p>This
 key chain is part of the LEGO Star Wars theme and the minifig we get is
 the original version of Darth Maul. It's a 
really 
cool minifig to have as a key chain but the only problems I have with 
those is that you're not able to take off the legs, the head or the 
headgear.<br></p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul><li>Minifig looks cool
</li></ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul><li>Legs, head and/or headgear don't come off<br></li></ul>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p></div></div></div></div></div>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
"BobaFett2","2010-09-07T18:03:12.713Z","Dunno if it's worth it","I'd only suggest this set for two reasons.<br><h4>Reason One</h4>This set contains Darth Maul, a rare and expensive minifigure. Like most Star Wars minifigures, they are overpriced on re-sale so if you are good at removing key chains without damaging the minifigure too badly, this might be an alternative to buying the minifigure.<br><h4>Reason Two</h4>More of a composite reason. For Star Wars Afficionados and those wishing to complete their LEGO Star Wars Collection, this can be nice just to have around with you. Bring it on your keys or on your backpack, anywhere-it won't get lost.<br><br>Key Chains just don't tend to be that nice, so I wouldn't really recommend it for anyone else.<br><br>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,2
