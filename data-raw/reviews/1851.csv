The Lego logo on the back is really annoying and can't be used as a minifig. Keychains aren't that good, and this is the reason why.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The figure is 'Brickster'; a sort of non-threatening villain who whilst looks mean, just talks the talk throughout most of the video game, leaving one use their own imagination when he was included in the LEGO City products!<div><br></div><div>I like the fact this guy is quite a rarity, but his presence isn't as striking as other minifigures since he didn't develop the same following as other popular figures. So while this shouldn't be viewed as an essential find, it will certainly add interest to anyone who is forming a collection.</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

It's a really cool minifig to have as a key chain but the only problems I have with those is that you're not able to take off the legs, the head or the headgear.<br></p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul><li>Minifig looks cool
</li></ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul><li>Legs, head and/or headgear don't come off<br></li></ul>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a great set to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p></div></div>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
