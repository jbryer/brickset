Pay for it a price like the impulse don't worth very much, but it still a good reason, because it is a &quot;modernization&quot; of the classic Lego astronaut (from the late 1970's years to the early 1990's years). The color schemes and details aren't simple like was with the original Lego astronauts, but is more clear than the new ones (without so much details, altough have notable red and gray parts). The increasements (just the helmet and the visor) are all useful, and features color schemes with compatibility to any other minifigures. Also, this minifigure have the original Lego minifigure's face, just simple and nice. 

Not simple like the classic Lego astronauts and not much detailed like the current, this is a awesome minifigure, so, if you find this by a price like 2 dollars, or 3 (no more than this!), or just find this complete minifigure being sold with another set, or lots of pieces or just with other minifigures, I recommend to buy it, because the details and color schemes combined in this are maybe unic. Regarding this set as a minifigure, I rate it a 4,6 of 5. Very nice.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
