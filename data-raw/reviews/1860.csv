Pros:
Cute
Rare beard

Cons:
None

I hung this keychain on my school pencilcase, so I played with it whenever the teacher is boring, especially in Biology classes :D.

Ho!","<p>Santa is one of my favorite minifigures of all time, and now he is in keychain form!&nbsp; Since this is a keychain set, Building experience, Parts, and Playabilty are very low, but the keychain is only $5, so the value for money is good.&nbsp; I really like the beard and red color on this guy, since it totally looks like Santa.&nbsp; Overall, the keychain is 10/10 (for a keychain) since Santa has contributed to a lot of my collection. *wink*</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5

<p>This figure has a very classic vibe that I wish Lego would do more in their key ring line up .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure starting at the top has the bandana piece in red with the classic minifigure smile a nice big white beard and plain red torso black hops and red legs .&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>like this key ring , is a fun one as it is designed to not look refined or modern so I recommend it .&nbsp;</p>
