This particular one is of the Indian Chief. His hands, arms legs and head move but he doesn't come apart, well his hands do but they dont count, which is a good thing as part of a key ring you wouldn't want to loose a piece, I know that would annoy me.

Overall it's a great little thing to collect or use and if you are able to acquire one I feel you should, 6/10 or above average from me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
