It is attached to my keys and I see it every day to remind me of my love of LEGO! The LEGO logo on the wizard's back is scratching off and his legs are very loose after using it for half a year but it is standing up pretty well otherwise. These minifig key chains are great. I can see wanting to collect them but I have to limit what LEGO I collect due to space restraints.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
