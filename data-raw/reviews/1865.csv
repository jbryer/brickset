This keychain is a minifigure, the minifigure of the &quot;Captain Roger&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;captain redbeard&quot;. 

This minifigure is rare now, but during the years of the lego pirates theme, this minifiguyre was common, released with notable sets, and also with small ones, like minifigure packs. Altough the details are simple, the shape (the original Lego minifigure shape), and color scheme (black, red and some brown, yellow and green colors in each deails), makes it well made. The hat, hook and wood leg are cool and original increasements.

Overall, it is rare and is useful to any Lego pirates or just classic Lego fan. If you find this by a price of a common keychain, it will be a good chance to get a nice minifigure. A 4,7 regarding this set as a keychain. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

cool minifig to have as a key chain but the only problems I have with
