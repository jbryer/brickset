"Evilnurn","2007-03-19T18:14:35.95Z","Extremely versatile","The good thing about this set is that the pieces are minimalist and allow for a lot of creativity while still making a good set. And the best part by far is the boat itself, which I have used in countless new creations based around a floating boat theme. Highly recommended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bsmarthen","2007-05-13T12:14:11.353Z","great","this boat is one of the best and it floats. Very nice ties into the race team theme. The detail is cool exhaust pipes. The motor can be seen through the deck of the boat. A must have for anyone that likes the boats.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-08-02T21:05:50.753Z","4/5 nice set for the most part","I love the figure, the boat base, and the engine, but what is with the few peices.  They aren't bad peices though, so it isn't all that bad.  The figure is great and is common in sets of that time.  The boat base is good with studs and for rebuilding into other boats.  THe engine and windsheild work well with the boats design.  Overall the set is worth getting at a cheaper price then the msrp, but is still a good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-03T10:35:10.597Z","NICE!","This is a nice boat! The only reason I give it a 4 out of 5 is that it comes with very few pieces! It does have nice parts though, like the engine you can see through the window, the boat floats and the nice pieces. I really enjoy this boat and think you should get it!

Long and sleek with a narrow beam, the Riptide Racer cuts through water just like its big brother.   The set is perfect in every way (I think) and I particularly like the white forepeak deck with the red cockpit surround, the ‘chrome’ exhaust pipes and oversized radar arch with navigation lights and radio antennae.   The power plant is viewable through a hatch arrangement and is sited just behind the cockpit, very realistic.

I liked this set so much I bought two!
