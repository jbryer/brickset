This is a great set because the boat floats, the parts are ok and not juniorisd, and the figure might look a bit plain by today's standards, but I love it. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-28T08:06:53.857Z","Not bad","Generally speaking, the design of this boat is quite good, with the only flaw that there is a certain wasted space on the deck.

The cabin is nice, and introduces an inverted windshield for the first time (together with the Freighter boat). Behind the cabin there is a motor section, which doesn't look bad at all but leaves the feeling that its 4-stud length could have been used better, perhaps including some opening compartments.

The rear part of the boat hosts the hook. The idea of hanging the hook to the curved yellow bar is very nice, but again leaves the feeling that some of the boat length is wasted.

Removing the central part of the tug boat is too much however (although it does give it a nice funny look) so perhaps the three sections are needed, but the conclusion is still that the deck could have looked a little better.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-15T06:51:33.857Z","Has aged very well over the years","This was a great set for particularly the lego company itself. What's the use of a tug boat if one hasn't got one or two other boats to be tugged?
That said, this set had to wait five long years before it finally got some real work cut out for it with the 4030 cargo carrier. But it's only at the arrival of the latest line of Lego ships that it has really come into its own. If you ever would have wanted this boat, it would be now.

If you're trying to get a copy of this set, make sure to get one with the stickers still intact. A plain black hull seriously compromizes the appeal of this ship

The relative size of this design, the extremely forward placed steering-cabin, the aft-bridge from where the winch operator has an overview over the open stern-deck; everything is exactly as it should be on a tug boat. (In order to optimize the maneouverability of a tug boat, the cable has to be attached close to its centre of gravity and as far away from the rudder as possible. This explains the 'waisted space' around the stern)

The cabin area is very cool and makes this set fun to play with. The boat is a little small which makes it good enough to be a tug boat. If Lego decides to make another tug, they should look at this set before making it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-20T14:00:22.857Z","Typical Tug Boat…","This was one of my first sets that I received as a present and it is still going strong all these years later, admittedly it is in dry dock now and on my shelf on display.

It’s a small set but full of fun!   The wheelhouse window is very typical of a tug boat as is the location of the all important towing line with the hook neatly attached to the rear rail.   I have never wanted to modify this set as I think it is perfect the way it is.

I just wish more sets were built along this line, there would have been so much scope for other sets using this interconnecting hull sections.

"PeteM","2018-05-30T15:36:32.5Z","Hook, Line, And Sinker","<p>This was one of my &lsquo;stalwart&rsquo; sets growing up &ndash; that is, one of the few that wasn&rsquo;t broken down to try and make a spaceship from. It&rsquo;s retained a degree of uniqueness down the years as it was the first and last time Lego made a proper System Minifig-scaled tug boat, with subsequent boat sets mostly tied to the Police,&nbsp;Fire and leisure&nbsp;themes.</p>

<h3>Parts and Minifigure</h3>

<p>There are only 66 parts in this set, the majority of which are unremarkable now, though at the time the inverted windscreen and stubby communications mast piece were new and exciting. Along with the other boats in this &lsquo;wave&rsquo;, it was final outing for the keel weight and individual hull pieces (a random dump of seemingly excess hull parts via a Dacta set in 1985 none withstanding!) as going forward, floating boats would have single moulded hulls. The rest of the set comprises a sparse selection of mostly white bricks and plates, along with a few red sloped and standard bricks.</p>

<p>The sole minifigure included in the set is plain but functional &ndash; sporting a blue torso and a matching black trousers and hat combo, he manages to look suitably sea faring without any printing or accessories.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>With so few pieces it&rsquo;s not the most involved build and the instructions whiz through the construction in 10 steps. Apart from layering of plates in order to inset black ladder pieces behind the wheelhouse at a different height to the grey ladder pieces further towards the back the superstructure, it&rsquo;s literally just brick stacking.</p>

<h3>Completed Set</h3>

<p>The end result is &ndash; to my nostalgia tinted eyes &ndash; a perfect representation of the subject matter and a great little toy to boot. It encompasses most of the design cues of real life tug boats, with the wheelhouse, engine vents and funnel all pushed forward on the deck to allow the towing line to be anchored as near to the centre of the boat as possible. This gives an odd, but prototypical, open space at the back of the deck, across which stretches&nbsp;the tow line and hook to the&nbsp;barrier right at the back. The design is bolstered by effective use of stickers, comprising a depth gauge indicator on the hull, registration number, &lsquo;hook and line&rsquo; insignia on the side and a crest to go on the bow &ndash; though their effect was only temporary as, needless to say, they didn&rsquo;t survive many bath times.</p>

<p>If I had to be picky, the gunwales are maybe a little high and the whole ship is too narrow, but the lack of scale is an acceptable compromise for ensuring stability in water and for it to float.&nbsp;Well I say &#39;float&#39;, but&nbsp;though the multiple hull pieces were a great idea (and marginally more &lsquo;Lego&rsquo; than what followed), they were not always particularly watertight even with the keel fixed to the bottom, and the ship rarely survived a bath without sinking at some point. According to the instructions a small motor could be fitted to the bottom of the keel piece, though I never investigated exactly how that would work!</p>

<p>Out of the water (and with the keel removed), it was a set that could with work equally well whether on its own or as part of a larger scenario. It was small enough to play with without needing to have any additional dock structures or anything to bring out the play value, and could be used as a standalone boat for whatever purpose you needed it for. Equally, if you had another boat in your collection (or made your own), deploying the tow hook and line to pull another ship around on the carpet was a surprisingly engaging activity! Having the split hull pieces also meant that you could re-enact shipwrecks and sinkings with a degree of &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo; &ndash; it&rsquo;s just shame it took Lego another seven years to introduce a shark&hellip;</p>

<p>The set was ripe for tearing down the limited superstructure and building your own, though due to the short length, it could look top heavy very quickly (not that that often mattered to seven year old me!). There wasn&rsquo;t much more you could do with the parts supplied &ndash; though it&rsquo;s hard to believe that it&rsquo;s only around 66 pieces, most of the bulk is down to the three large hull pieces. The limited and contrasting colour palette (black, white and red highlight for the funnel) actually made it distinctive and clean looking, meaning it works well as a display piece even now. It look great as part of a harbour scene and still matches with far more modern sets &ndash; it might stand out a little against a Friends cruiser, but can still hold it&rsquo;s own in an industrial port setting. Great little set.</p>

It has huge playabillity and construction is much better than the nowadays boats', fresh, nice and qualitate Danish. So, if your child loves boats, buy him/her this one (if you can), because, that's the best boat starter set.</div>",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Trautlego","2021-02-20T17:36:33.507Z","Fun Boat","<p>This was one of my first sets as a kid. &nbsp;The boat went through many different transformations over the years. &nbsp;When I brought it back to its original set it brought back so many memories. &nbsp;It came with a weight that allowed it to float in the bathtub. &nbsp;The tow hook and rope were great for saving other ships in distress or hauling a load. &nbsp;The minifig is also simple yet professional looking.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very simple built with fairly simple pieces. &nbsp;In the end,&nbsp;it&#39;s an amazing little boat that provides hours of fun. &nbsp;I would highly recommend it for any collectors harbor.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
