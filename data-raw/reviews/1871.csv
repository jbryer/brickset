The next wave of boats were all wrong: huge fire ship, big police launch...and no freighter.  Where are the fires that they are supposed to put out, and the ships they are supposed to inspect for dangerous cargo?  This set was just right: simple black-and-white scheme, clever opening top so you could play in the cabin, and a lowered cockpit in the rear.  Criminals and smugglers beware!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Cool boat antenna, 2 police mini figures, room on the deck for play as well as in the cabin. I am not a boat fan but this boat does the trick for me!

"Niklas_Lindström","2008-12-12T06:59:04.92Z","Great set because it floats","This is the other boat i own that floats, We had a bathtub in our old house. It was fun to take two lego boats to the tub, Later we figured out that the battery powered motor from some playmobil boat, fitted straight to the bottom of the boats, then there were no need for weight brick...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"YeahYeahYouWere","2007-11-07T13:59:14.92Z","Has Its Ups and Downs","I owned this set for a very long time, and while I certainly appreciated some things about it, on the whole, I always felt like there was something missing.  Of course, the main problem I had with this set was that most of the boat was already built for you.  I realize of course that this enabled it to really float, but to me, that was secondary to the actual building of the hull and such.  As such, I really enjoyed this set but I always felt a little short-changed when it came to the building of it.  I did really like the way the top of the body opened up to reveal more playable area underneath.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-20T07:47:31.2Z","Timeless Classic...","This set was one of the first which I was bought as a youngster in the early 80’s.   I have two of these, both in mint condition but missing the boxes sadly.   The boat floats in the bath, pool or at the local marina.   The style is simple yet effective, with a large opening section allowing access to the lower cabin.   I have modified the cabin area as it was a little sparse for my liking (I have also modified the cabin on the Cabin Cruiser 4011).   I felt sorry for the skipper having to stand up, so I provided him with a helm seat on a pedestal, other than that a nice simple set which looks like a true classic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Krogh","2009-12-15T08:15:05.607Z","Police at it's best","This set was the absolute best set of my cildhood, i just had so much fun with it, in the bath tub, in the pool, even sometimes in our local summer lake. To me, this is Lego at it's best.

Solid cast hull, that makes it possible for the boat to float, space and a chair inside the cabin, lots of nice detail, such as the little antennas, the radar, lights on the deck, the roof opens up for accesability to the cabin, there's even a sunroof, and it has sleek fast design (for it's time, anyway), so, it's the perfect set, at least in my opinion.

I was truly amazed that i still had all the pieces for this one, when i resently started putting it back together, i even found the infamous weight brick in the bottom of the box, that had all my disassembled sets. Thank god for online set guides!! :)

This little boat would run circles around the police boats of today! :)

Anyway, 5/5 from me, as i said, in my opinion, it's the perfect set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-09T02:20:55.743Z","Justice Floats!","It was an exciting and infrequent release, so when ever boat sets appeared that had the ability to actually float, many would set their sites on getting some or one they could afford because if memory serves they were a fair bit more expensive than a similar size set.<br><div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>Standard white cap brigade officer (always fighting over who is chief) naturally with a cb radio and also a hand held search light.</li><li>Protective uniform officer with the zipper.

There is a sun roof and the white rails look excellent on the deck. The cabin itself contains a control area and chair and makes a great little IZ (imagination zone).

"Hashem1983","2015-02-26T15:14:39.403Z","My cousin had it and I want to have it as well","<p>I first saw this set with my cousin and I wanted to have the set that he has, sadly a lot of the small pieces and accessories are lost and I am going to mention what is still available and what is lost and what is also got broken and lost.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Decent size but not with a flip cover as most of medium and large boxes usually have, the artwork showing the main boat floating in the water (I haven&#39;t tried that yet) and on the back of the box showing what you could do with the boat (I have thrown the box or my mom threw it and I cannot really remember but I am relying on the images of the box from the Internet)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>mostly basic but here&#39;s a brief:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The hull of the boat itself&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A black 2X8 weigh brick that is used on the back bottom of the boat</li>
	<li>White Window panels with 4 blue windows (1 window is lost not the panels it self)</li>
	<li>White&nbsp;mast on the top (Which got broken and lost)</li>
	<li>2 White Antennas (Lost)</li>
	<li>Red helmet &amp;&nbsp;oxygen tank&nbsp;(Lost)</li>
	<li>The front windows in transparent blue</li>
	<li>2 flat transparent 1X1 plate one in red and one in green (LOST :( )</li>
	<li>Black Walky talky (Lost)</li>
	<li>2 of the L shaped in white that is used one as a flash light and the other as a stand for the satellite&nbsp;with the round grey piece (Lost)</li>
	<li>3 black speakers (2 are lost) and two of them are used as a flash light</li>
	<li>3 White fences (Got broken and lost)</li>
	<li>White slope bricks</li>
	<li>Basic white bricks and plates</li>
	<li>Blue Plates &amp; Bricks: &nbsp;3 of 2X1 brick and a 2X6 plate, blue chair, 6X6 Plate, and a driving wheel</li>
	<li>A white hinge&nbsp;with a window in the middle</li>
	<li>White jumper piece</li>
	<li>Transparent&nbsp;Yellow studs (Lost)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, lots os Lost pieces but try to support me here</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 minifiguers in Police uniform, one drives the boat and the other does the searching and diving, as it is a rescue boat.</p>

<p>And one more thing, one of the police hats&nbsp;is missing, so only one remains.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy to put it together, I was also one of the kind who likes to build only once from the instructions and try to memorize it, taking off the parts and rebuild it without looking at the instructions, I guess that is why I have lost and broke a lot of pieces.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The completed model</span></p>

<p>Its lovely boat no doubt about it, maybe it could use a side ladder, but when opening the top its hard to insert the hands inside,&nbsp;but rather than that I have no comments.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">I do like it and if I went back in time I would buy it again and I try to take good care of it,&nbsp;maybe I was a bit careless child (After you knew about the amount of the lost parts), but now I have rebuilt it and used other parts to recreate a new look for the boat itself.<br />
If you are thinking about getting it in a very good price it is a nice choice, it is more of a rescue boat than a boat for&nbsp;Thief catchers</p>

"medleyj","2020-05-06T16:26:37.73Z","Boat that floats, great addtion to the city harbor","<p>It&#39;s one of the smaller boats that LEGO released with a solid hull. There are 2 rare/unique pieces in this set. The black boat hull and the black 2x2x6 black weighted brick that is placed in the back of the boat to allow the front to raise up a little out of the water to avoid sinking. The next closest thing to a rare piece is the mast on top of the boat for radio communications.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set includes 2 basic design police officer minifigures. It&#39;s a nice addition to the city harbor if you have several of those related sets.&nbsp;</p>
