"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T12:36:04Z","Great!!","One of my favorite sets ever, if not my favorite. I still remember wanting the police boat but then getting this one and realizing it's 100x better! The fishing pole and hull are very unique pieces. The weighted ballast it came with was a little too heavy, but that never bothered me. As well, the hull comes with a shape molded into the bottom so that one can attach a battery-powered model boat motor. I later got one of these and the results are legendary.... I can still remember playing with it in my bathtub.... so much fun!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-13T17:03:05Z","Great boat","This is a small realistic yacht,but it's lacking interior details but it has more details then 4031.It has got a fishing pole,a nice 33&#176; slope window and it can be powered by a motor like all sets of the 1991 Boats line.The Interior features a chair and some kind of desk,but again no bedBut this can be modified easily.Simply add 4 more pieces abd bring the chair to another position.Then you've got a bed.Well this little boat is a nice addition to any town and good for some interior modifications.By the way the hull is the only big piece,but useful for your own smaller boats.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T15:54:17Z","Floating boat fun","This was the first and only boat that I ever had, but I really liked it a bunch.  I remember as a kid especially liking it because it was my only set with a shark!  I must have played with that shark more than any other single piece.  The boat is a really nice set too!  The life-jackets are really nice pieces too.  Overall, it's a wonderful boat set that I highly recommend!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T17:23:21Z","The Awesome boat for a lake","This is a perfect set for any old youngsters that likes to play in the water. It has a cabin, well duh thats why its the Cabin Cruiser! Well into business again, The cabin cruiser can float perfectly and has a cool, rare fishing rod. I recommend this set for about kids up to 8, because for older people, this might be like building Duplo!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-11T19:55:55Z"," Recreational Boat","   This set is the best! Finally a set that ISNT Police! I loved it, this set is an actual citizens set that gives you an awesome shark whoms mouth can hinge. You get the captain of the boat and the fisherman! The boat has a nice bottom section to pile stuff or just make room for the figs to hang out. The fishing rod might be the best part, it is completely awesome and the minifigs and grasp it! The floating thing works well! This set is a defanite goody for me and is in my fishing pod catching cat fish! It is a super nice set but is is 14 years old, so get it before they become extinct!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-11-24T03:39:40.34Z","Good yacht","This boat is really great because it can really swim on water. Apart from that, you get a shark and a fishing rod. The boat has a below-deck, where the minifigs can spend some time when they are fed up with fishing. Both minifigs came with life jackets. You get a captain, who steers the yacht, and a fisherman. And you can add a motor, which must be bought separately.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-21T18:21:23.78Z","Float On","This is a very cool boat which is very detailed and fun to play with. I like the fishing rods because you don't see these pieces that often but I wouldn't consider them to be rare. There aren't too many stickers here which is nice. This is a very cool boat and for all those reasons why.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-20T08:18:32.387Z","A really great set which is simple yet realistic...","Another great floating boat set from Lego.   I have always wondered if this set was based on a real boat, the Seamaster 813.   It is very similar in lines to this real boat; even the graphics on the hull are similar.   The design is uncomplicated and representative of a real cabin cruiser, the white cabin construction is similar to the fibreglass construction of the real thing too.   I have one of these in my collection which has ‘yellowed’ and it looks very effective too as some cabin cruisers are an off-white colour so this provides some variety when this set is displayed in a marina setting.

The cabin (like 4010) was very sparse so I furnished it with ‘V’ berths, a galley area and a WC.   I have also filled in the space between the cabin and the cockpit by inserting a window which looks out into the cockpit; this does not affect the bridge area or the cockpit.   I have added some large aerials to some of my cabin cruisers, these have either been placed directly onto the top of the windshields or I have added a bracket to the side of the boat and inserted the aerial in that way.   I would like to add some large fishing rods to the sides of the boat in the future, as these are a common sight in American marinas where sports fishing boats moor.

The white hull also provides a good base from which to design and construct your own cabin cruiser, I have done so many times, and every time it ends up different from the last one.

A really great set which is simple yet realistic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Chris_Diehl","2012-03-21T22:49:28.803Z","Pretty nice boat!","<p>Considering that there are plenty of other reviewers out there and most of the sets I have are 15+ years old, my reviews are going have a much different angle to them versus a build straight out of a sealed box from the store.&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe this style may actually help someone in a similar situation, or just be an entertaining read about the durability and uniqueness of its parts.&nbsp; My criteria will&nbsp;be more based upon survivability of a set after being built, played with, disassembled, and its parts reused in multiple other configurations as many kids will do.&nbsp; Next will be my ability to find its parts that have been stored in a Rubbermaid tub for over a decade, and to see what wear and tear may have affected it.&nbsp; Keep in mind that I have over 50 sets stored in multiple containers where they have remained for 10-15&nbsp;years.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also somewhat sorted them out as best I can to speed up the part search process.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This set is pretty durable as the hull is one piece and making up the bulk of the build.&nbsp; It has some fairly unique pieces that were pretty easy to find including the red weight piece, the windshield canopies, and the fishing line reel.&nbsp; With those being the few unique pieces, the rest were pretty standard and easy to find in my assortment of tubs taking less than an hour to find and build this set.&nbsp; There are a few drawbacks to this set though with the hull's decals being prone to peeling/drying up and falling off, and the fishing reel thread either getting tangled or cut as in my situation.&nbsp; Sometime over the years the decals have either been peeled off or fell off on their own though I have not found them in my tubs.&nbsp; I'm doubtful of being able to acquire replacement decals though making this rebuild just shy of full quality.&nbsp; The reel's line has frayed and has snapped, although replacing this with some new thread will be pretty simple.&nbsp; With the exception of these two problems though, it has held up very well with age and is in great shape.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Solid pieces with low chance of damage when stored for years</li><li>With the exception of a few, most pieces are standard and easy to find</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The use of decals on the hull make the likeliness of them surviving many years in storage low</li><li>The fishing reel thread is prone to getting tangled or cut, but is easily replaceable</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With the exception of the decals, this set can be built, taken apart, stored for years, and finally rediscovered and built without any problems.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4

I still have all the pieces, wish i had the instructions.<br><br>The best thing about this set is the boat floats in water. The shark is an added bonus too.

"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-14T11:08:02.29Z","I'm on a boat!","<p>There are a handful of LEGO sets that involve the use of the specialised floating hull piece, and they're almost all universally cool because of their utility as vessels that are actually seaworthy. (Okay, perhaps ""seaworthy"" is too strong of a word. ""Poolworthy"", maybe.)&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Boat sets are not going to be known for their enormous piece count, and the bulk of their cost will clearly stem from the hull piece, so this is clearly not something that you'd want to invest in if you're looking for spare parts. Conversely, the low number of pieces makes this set pretty easily to replicate once you can get your hands on the hull piece and the weighted red brick, so&nbsp;recreating or otherwise modifying this set ought not to be an&nbsp;issue. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, in spite of this set's simplicity, I do have very fond memories of it. A pair of Minifigs populate the boat: a skipper who has a tiny anchor emblazoned on his torso behind his life vest, and his cruising partner donning a cap and simple striped shirt. Again, neither of these Minifigs is particularly noteworthy, but they are perfect for a leisurely trip on the high seas. The activity of choice here, I guess, is shark fishing, which is not the most politically correct leisure activity in the world but a fun one from a LEGO point of view. The fishing rod is a little finicky to set up, but it's kind of cool because the shark can clamp its jaws around the piece tied to the end of it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The boat itself manages to pack in a lot of nice details in spite of its small piece count, and one advantage that Cabin Cruiser has over its remake, Fishing Boat (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=4642-1"">4642</a>),&nbsp;is that part of the top deck opens up to reveal a cozy cabin underneath. The exterior is perfectly functional, of course, where there are more than enough chairs for the Minifigs to relax while on open waters. As a whole, the boat has a very clean and streamlined appearance that looks good even when compared to contemporary sets (with the previously mentioned Fishing Boat being the primary set to compare it to). Unfortunately, the loooooong sticker than runs horizontally along the top of the hull has a tendency to peel, especially when exposed repeatedly to water, and&nbsp;so it's morel&nbsp;likely than not that&nbsp;there'll be noticeable deficiencies in this regard if you're buying the hull second-hand, unless, of course, the original owners were diligent enough to not apply them. <br></p><p>That aside, this is one fantastic boat, and I'm certainly glad that enough people thought it was cool enough such that it warranted a remake. Cabin Cruiser is a beautiful and gentle set all on its own, and also opens itself up to a lot of simple modifications to suit your own tastes. It might not be the closest approximation to owning an actual life-size boat, but perhaps it'll do with a little imagination. </p>",TRUE,5,5,3,5,4

<p>Me trae grandes recuerdos ya que me lo regalaron poco despu&eacute;s de ver la pel&iacute;cula &quot;Tibur&oacute;n&quot; &nbsp;(Jaws) y me di&oacute; muchas horas de diversi&oacute;n, gracias a Dios mi padre nunca me dej&oacute; meterla en la piscina para ver como flotaba...</p>

"carlosfsm","2014-05-04T01:47:43.083Z","Loved it!","<p>I loved this set. I remember that it was a great toy because this was the only boat I had that actually floated. This came with a shark that was very nice detailed and of course the shark always had a way to be part of the different stories I played with all my sets.</p>

<p>One very nice thing is that the cabin opens to let you get people inside the boat or whatever you wanted.</p>

<p>Lots of fun...</p>

"JagWat","2015-11-10T00:19:00.913Z","Good Set","<p>This is one of the earliest sets I remember owning and was a constant companion at bath time. I&#39;ve had a lot fun with this set as a kid and now it sits on a shelf as a display piece (Albeit a little tatty and faded).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Not really applicable to a younger me. I&#39;ve rebuilt it recently using online pdf versions of the original instructions. Its easy enough to follow and would be hard to make any major mistakes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a good selection of different parts. With all the sloped angles, levers and other various bricks it makes for a stylish looking boat and parts to add to other builds too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I liked the figures from this set and think they are really fitting to the theme. The Captain has a plain white shirt with an anchor on it and he comes with the all important all important captains hat. The other person has a fitting sweater and a base ball cap, quite stereotypical sea fisherman in my mind.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A fully enjoyable build. Its not too easy that its a bore but not too challenging that its frustrating. The down side to this set is the detailing on the side as its a ;ong fiddly sticker.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A good looking set, its go a sense of style about it that most sets seemed to lack around that period.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It looks good sat on a shelf as a retro display piece and I would imagine it would look well as part of a harbor scene too. Most of all, its a great model for kids to play with as its fairly tough and can be used as a boat.</p>

<p>It does have a couple of downsides however. The first is the stickers, it being an older set mine have disappeared. I believe the water caused them to slowly peel and loose stick.</p>

<p>The other issue is the weighted brick that sits in the bottom of boat. I found it causes it to be very back heavy and bob under the water. The water gets in between the hull and the shaped base plate through gaps in the sides and the holes near the back and front of the boat. It takes a long time for it to dry out and if left can start to smell a little.</p>

<p>Apart from this its a great set and I&#39;m glad I own it.</p>
