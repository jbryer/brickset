"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-17T18:43:07Z","A GREAT SET","This is a really great set!these boats do float(or at least this one does).there is a hatch under the search light,I guess its the engine room by the panels.THere are alot of great glass panels that add to the feel/look of the ship.There is a cockpit type thing at the top of the ship,over the cockpit there is a long white beam with the police lights and radio antenna thing.This set includes two black walkie-talkies(hand held radios),a rope that can be used to rescue someone,and two officers with life vests.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The boat hull could have been used for anything involving a boat. If your waters want protection, this is the one you need.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-31T12:04:45.19Z","LEGO Boats - Wave Cops Review","The wave cops set is a very fun set to put together and it also floats on water. We get two cops with a white cap, black shades and a yellow life jacket which were basic to the old LEGO Town theme in the 1990's. This boat looks really neat and it's very sturdy of course. I like the way how LEGO did the cockpit in the inside of the ship and there's a nice cockpit in the outside as well. This set comes with two walkie-talkies for the cops and you also have to put on some stickers.<br><br>If you still play with your LEGO's in your bath tub this set will be a great model to get because it really floats on water as I told you in the beginning. This set is a great addition to your LEGO City harbor collection which is going on sale now.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

I only got my hands on this set last year, I found it at Brickfactory and as soon as I saw it I headed straight to eBay and found one for £5.00 Buy It Now!   

I am extremely impressed with ‘Wave Cops’ as it is a real departure from the earlier Police Boat (4010).   Wave Cops is much sleeker than the previous police boat (4010) and has a lower coachroof with plenty of windows and a glass hatch.   The cockpit area is quite small and accommodates two or three minifigs comfortably.   The large radio aerial is raked back, this gives the boat a sporty feel.   Mounted on the radar arch is the radar dish along with what looks to be a video camera and of course the mast.   On the coachroof is mounted a 360° revolving search light, while the fore peak accommodates a bollard which could be used for securing the boat to a quayside or other vessel, possibly while a search is underway.

I have a second Wave Cops which has lost it's stickers and has started to yellow, I am hoping to restore this one soon.

This is a great addition to any port or marina and a set I love.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
