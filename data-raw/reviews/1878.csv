<h4>Pros:</h4>
<ul><li>Nice pieces!</li><li>Cool cockpit!</li><li>Rotor!</li><li>Variety of colours!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons:</h4>
<ul><li>Very small propeller blades!</li><li>Easy to build.</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>I never remember building this set, but I still have the parts, like the teeny propeller, the cockpit, some of the plates and the tail brick. I say that the only problem with this set is that the propeller is small. If you look at the 4098, that's much better. However, the parts will really help you with your collection! I still have them!</p><p>Overall, get&nbsp;this&nbsp;set, but just for the parts!</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,2,3
