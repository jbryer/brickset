Never thougt the martian had a name.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2007-07-25T15:20:51.393Z","Cheap ($) Set!","This has to be the best promotional set of them all (and the only one I own).  The martin has a cool hover vehicle, while the astronaut rides around on his scouter thing, also it's the only LOM set with an martin and a human.  Nicely done TLC.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I owned this set a long time ago in a galaxy far far away, and this set rocks! Not bad for a cheap set, it comes w/alien, and astro and gun! Love the vechicles creative! Can't believe this was a promtotional release!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-12-03T20:14:06Z","Cool!","Wow. Humans and aliens in the same set! This is pretty rare in this theme. The alien minifigure has apretty boring face, but its still a cool martian. the human is neat, and both vechicles look pretty nice, especially the cool alien verchile. Awesome set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"ledaKat","2009-10-20T02:55:07.653Z","A Secret Love Affair?","I think this set is just wonderful. It was my third Life on Mars set and is my favourite of all three.
As with all the Life on Mars sets, it is made up of gorgeous colours and those unique alien minifigs. Vega is my favourite of these martians, in fact she is my favourite minifig of all minifigs that I own. She is quite simply beautiful. I sense there is something special between her and the astronaut, like a secret love affair or forbidden friendship.

It is a tiny set, but is an absolute must if you have other LoM sets. I like Vega's machine with the propeller under the satelite, she is a hardworking alien and looks kinda sad. Perhaps I see a little of myself in her, that was why I was drawn to this set.

The vehicle of the astronaut is a bit lame to be honest, just two fat barrel wheels and a technic arm on one side. It wobbles a bit and doesn't really feel secure, but perhaps that is because they are on Mars and not Earth, it must be designed for the Martian atmosphere? I imagine its quite a funky ride over the uneven terrain. But this is a promotional set I have recently learned, and so we are pretty lucky to get two minifigs and two vehicles so I will let that design imperfection slide.

If you find it and like the Life on Mars theme, then you should not hesitate to get this one too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is a great set to get into the theme, as it includes an alien and a human, plus two decently fun builds. It&#39;s definitely a great set, one of my favorite polybags of Space, as a theme.</p>
