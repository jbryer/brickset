"lordjim13","2006-08-04T20:04:20Z","Realistic and fun","I still remember when and where I got this set, and how excited I was.  And it was a great model, too.  First, it resembled a real ship--unlike the later models that look like overgrown speed-boats--and second it had some great details, especially the hatches leading to the engine-room below.  Simply brilliant.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-09-01T09:06:42.48Z","The Old Faithful…","It doesn’t seem 22 years since I got this, but it must be as I got it new!   It was, and still is a favourite set with so much to do with it.   Included are three minifigs; two fire-fighters and the captain.

The fire boat features a smart one-piece red hull with a grey deck which is stepped up at the bow with a raised gunwale.   Far aft is a lower deck area which features a winch in a housing unit with cable and hook attached.   There is also a red control point from which a minifig can ‘use’ the winch.   The marine engine is recessed into a hold under the deck level; this area is accessed through two folding hatches for maintenance etc.   Abaft of the engine room hatches are various electronic control panels along with a tilt and swivel water cannon with control throttle.   

The wheelhouse is situated well forward just behind the stepped forepeak.   The wheelhouse features access ladders, steering wheel and control levers / computer screen.   Slightly aft of the wheelhouse is the black funnel with white and red band, handheld fire extinguishers and wheels for opening / closing the water flow from the water tanks.   The wheelhouse roof features a high mast complete with anchor light, searchlight and VHF antennae.   Two further water jets are mounted on a tilting / swivelling bracket on the wheelhouse roof.   The forepeak has two loudhailers and what looks to be a windlass along with hawsehole on either side.

Finally, there are associated graphics included in the set which comprise of the boats identification number (4020), Plimsoll line as well as the fire-fighter logos.

Another very pleasing set on a great scale which looks great in any harbour or coastal setting.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
