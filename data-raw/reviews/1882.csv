When I built it for the first time - just under an hour ago - I was shocked to see how big it is, I mean the picture just doesn't do the size of it justice. I like the way that there are two sets of controls, and the little hatchway in between them. I love the engine, and raised platfrom at the front. It's strange that Lego put such an emphasis on the engine and then supplied two fire extinguishers. Right now the boat is front of me on the desk, the engine covers are open with the engine in flames and two of the guys - one on either side of it - are using the fire extinguishers to put the fire out, and the other guy is standing on the top bridge screaming and waving his arms wildly. Never before have I seen Lego try to actually suggest a play scenario. Spooky, huh.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-11T18:09:59Z"," Awesome in the water","This big old boat is really good designed and floats really well in the water. It does sink down about half ways in the water though. I love all the police sets, I love the police! They have choppers, cars, bikes, boats, and headquarters for police and i think that is just so awesome. This boat goes well with the other police stuff as well so you can get this. It is not so expensive and the only con is, it once sinked to the bottom of a pool, a few pieces came off ( lost one of them), and the winshield got scratched.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
