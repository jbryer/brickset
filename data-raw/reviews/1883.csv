I just got it after a purchase in ebay and I have no regrets with the purchase.

Lego 4022 Sea Cutter one of the best design for Lego Boats.
I feel honored being the first to rate this Sea Cutter in Brickset.

1st: ++++ Size of the Boat.
2nd: +++ Really Floats.
3rd: +++ 3 minifigs with ideal faces.
4th: +++ It look more like a Coast Guards Boats to me.
5th: +++ Lots of interior room area enable more customize parts to hold some hand held tools for minifigs.
6th: ++++ The front of the boat with the anchor like structure &amp; the search lights.
7th: ++++ Just behind the captain area has plates with hooks for hooking up the minifig accessories, the diving gear/oxygen tank &amp; full face helmet.
8th: ++++ Standing Captain for during operation of the Sea Cutter.
9th: ++++ Rear towing line for the Sea Cutter with antenna acting as the power switch for operating the hook.
10th: ++ Nice design for the stickers.

Dislikes:
1st: ----- What are the 2 Steering Wheels for? One is for the captain and while the other is located at the working area just below the transparent cover.
2nd: -- Stickers. Why can't they just have printed parts?

Thanks &amp; B.Rgds

The 3 man crew is perfect for the boat.  The boat itself has super playability and also lots of places for customization.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-08-21T02:11:34.983Z","Almost Perfect…","This has always ranked as my second favourite set.   I’m afraid that when it was released I didn’t get hold of it and it was only three years ago that I got hold of one, mint in the box from eBay.   I now have two of these, one in mint condition stored safely in its box and the second one was ‘thrown in’ to a bulk order from eBay.   The seller asked if I could do anything with a part-built coastguard boat and I said “I could” and it arrived.   Only when it arrived did I see that it was 4022 and it was in a real mess.   For some reason the hull was badly marked, possibly with ink or crayon, the stickers were missing, the flying bridge was missing it went on … but it was free!   Anyway, I have removed about 10 years worth of dust from this one and managed to get the hull clean (it actually shines) and my next job is to remove the old stickers and have some new ones made.   The flying bridge is now rebuilt from ‘spare’ parts which I have and it’s looking pretty good.

Highlights of this set I think include the dual steering positions.   When the weather becomes inclement, the skipper can take refuge in the covered cockpit towards the bow of the vessel.   The raked back aerials (like Wave Cops) give the boat a sporty appearance along with the two small grey aerials on the radar arch.   I could never decide on whether the grey ‘goblets’ were designed to be search lights or air-horns!   I am guessing horns, but on one of my sets I have turned them into ‘infa-red’ searchlights!   The winch handling area is simple and uncluttered; there is storage in lockers built into the superstructure and look at those ‘chrome’ spotlights on the forepeak.   A mooring bollard completes this area nicely.

As you can probably tell, I love this set, and I give it full marks, however it is almost perfect, in my opinion.   I think the cutter would have looked much better without that raised gunwale at the bow.   I think if the deck had been the same level all the way along it would have looked sportier and even sleeker, unless this vessel was intended for ice-breaking duty in colder climates, then this feature is unnecessary as water would wash over the decks and run off further astern.   OK, it’s a minor niggle, but its still a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
