Made me think that I had the most up to date FD around.  I wish that Lego would have made a Firehouse on the water to dock this beauty ala Pier Police.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I think it is quite safe to say that this set is now looking its age, especially with the recent introduction of the new police boats, fire boats and coast guard line.   However, build a maritime museum for your Lego Town and make this the centrepiece!   The vessel features the ever-popular and rather ingenious hull sections which fit together to form the base of the boat.   These sections are watertight when joined and when coupled with the keels, they float perfectly with just the correct level of trim.   Five sections make up the hull, in a bright red colour with grey deck.   Right at the bow there is a fairlead provided for anchor handling procedures or for mooring the vessel in the harbour.

The superstructure is moulded in white and features grey steps to access the wheelhouse.   Built into the external front of the wheelhouse is a panel which accommodates a hose reel and water jet.   Slightly aft of the wheelhouse are three brackets which hold axes and handheld VHF radios.   On the opposite side of the wheelhouse in the same area is a decal which shows the various switches to operate the various water pumps.   Abaft of this area is an alcove where breathing apparatus is stored ready for use while further aft are more hose reels as well as the aft deck telescopic fire-fighting platform with yellow handrails and two more fire-fighting jets attached to deck mounted pumps.   A smaller, tilting fire-fighting platform is provided up on the forepeak with fixed water jets and a seat.

A blue funnel with black exhaust outlet is sited aft of the wheelhouse along with more yellow handrails.   The usual navigation lights and burgee mast are attached to the wheelhouse roof along with the anchor light.

I had many hours of fun with this set as a youngster, I also rebuilt it time and time again, my favourite alternative boat which I built with the five hull sections was a river trip boat, with central wheelhouse, a bar, and seats / tables under covers forward and aft of the wheelhouse – great fun!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
