"mrmitch","2007-08-03T14:48:28.41Z","Just adding to my extra bulk bricks","Would not have gotten this set unless it was on sale. I picked it up for two US dollars, not bad for 100 LEGO pieces. I sorted them into thier proper tubs once at home and are used in our freestyle building. Nothing to brag about just more bircks for the collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-12-27T21:46:24.06Z","Good for portable play, otherwise nothing great","This set is not too special it just adds to your collection. However, this set is good if you want to bring something to play with during a trip, as it is mess free and very easy to clean up. It comes with basic bricks and a few small plates, plus an idea book for some of the things you can build. Other than that possibilities are very limited and I guarantee that if you ever got this set, it would have been scattered along with your collection in no less than a week.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
