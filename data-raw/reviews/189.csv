The pink bike is extremely rare and can be only found in a few sets and were also promos. If you do have this set, you are very lucky and should keep it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

As for the minifig - it's a classic boy, nothing else, except that his arms are pink as well. As for the torso - here You have to use a sticker. Yes, the letter T on his front part is a sticker, as well as the one on his back.

I guess that's a good addition for those who enjoy sport theme in Lego.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-24T10:18:21.437Z","LEGO Town (Team Telekom) - Telekom Race Cyclist Review","This is a nice little set to have and fun to play with as well. It may doesn't have any play features but it's still fun to build this. We also get a few stickers for the cyclist to put on which I didn't like. This bike is very easy to maneuver and this set is very useful if you want to build a bike team. It's a good little set to have - even for the bike and for the minifig which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
