"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-23T08:58:58Z","best freighter ever","I bought this set recently and fell in love with it instantly. It is a masterpiece in design and functionality, clear forms and colours as all the sets from the 8o's have. Especially I like the containers - 4 of them, that's more than any other freighter (except Maersk) has!
The little crane isn't worth much, but this big boat looks fantastic combined with the 6541 harbour set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It has some unique parts which actually cannot be seen: the ballast weights in the belly. These are hollow bricks with metal rods in them. Only floating models have such parts. And this model has the largest floating hull, I believe, only 4031 Fire Rescue Ship has the same size in the boat models line-up.
Later I made some other models using this hull, like a destroyer and once the Titanic, of course it was not scaled to minifigs.
Too bad I didn't take pictures of it, that time digital photography was not even in my dreams...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoCoastalPatrol","2009-09-01T09:24:51.187Z","Bulk Cargo Carrier…","Another set which I collected at the same time as the Fire-fighter Boat (4020) and one which resided in my harbour for a long time.   Now it is safely stored away.   

The ship featured a smart one-piece blue hull with grey deck areas, like the fire-fighter boat, it too has a stepped forepeak deck.   The forepeak area features a mast with steaming light and spotlight.   Forward of the mast is the windlass and winch mechanism together with a tool rack and bow roller.   In the raised gunwales at the bow are the hawseholes to allow the mooring rope to pass through to the quayside.   The main deck features two large cargo holds with opening hatches covering them and a central crane with adjustable derricks for loading / unloading of cargo from the two holds.   The area aft of the superstructure houses more tools and a red fire extinguisher.

The superstructure comprises of the accommodation block and bridge.   Access to the space below the bridge is not granted; presumably this would be the crew’s quarters.   The bridge is furnished with a ship-to-shore telephone and navigation equipment as well as a throttle and control lever.   This area can be accessed via more folding plates.   The bridge has viewing wings which also house the port and starboard navigation lights.   A black funnels climbs the rear of the superstructure, this funnel has a blue and white band built into it.

Deck cargo comprises of four containers with opening doors, two in red and two in yellow.   These can be raised / lowered with ease using the deck-mounted crane and associated derricks.

The ship comes complete with a captain and two crewmen, several pieces of ballast and the provision for adding a small motor to the keel.

The ship could be described as being a little bland and lacking in character, possibly typical of the real things, but that doesn’t mean a little customisation can’t take place!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
