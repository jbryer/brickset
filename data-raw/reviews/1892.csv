Now to the Model:
The Helicopter looks nicer than the newer more or less juniorized ones, like the Police helicopter from the World City theme, or some helicopters,that were around between 1997 and 2000.
The boat is awesome. It has got some details and two, I think rare clear inverted slope windows. Well the interior is lacking. I'm missing a bed for an injured person, because in the small room is only a telephone and a seat. It would have been better if this room was 8x6 studs than only 4x6 studs, so that a bed could fit into it. Well the bridge is big enough for two figures. There are 5 water cannons for firefighting but who controls the two cannons above? All in all a great set with only minor flaws.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It does not only come with 4 minifigs, but there's also room and a specific role for each and every one of them. The set itself is quite detailed, even though it could benefit from another staff room - but then again, there should always be a good reason to use your own imagination and add to what LEGO have offered, right?

The ship itself is a bit fragile, especially the two upper cannons and the antennae, but that's not so much of a problem. The bricks contained in this set can be used for pretty much anything and the hull of the ship itself is the perfect foundation of any water-themed MOC.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
