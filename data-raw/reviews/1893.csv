1. Blue shirt of pilot. In history, pilot always wears black clothing.
2. Pilot has a chair. In history, LEGO plane does not have a chair for the pilot. (If I did not make mistake.) It seems to be the first time.
3. ‘Short’ plane body and ‘long’ wings
4. No longer adopting wing 7x12 left and right
5. Front side is a bit higher. In history, the whole body is ‘balanced’.
6. Two wheels are at the front, four wheels are at the rear of the body
7. Jet engines can be slightly ‘turned’ to left or right by about 5 degrees.
8. LEGO style Boeing 727. Since there is only two chairs for passengers. The plane should be called a private plane.
9. First transparent dark black glass for airplane
10. It is recommended for collection purpose. From feedback of other collectors, hinges are not opened easily. Gently handle the wings.

Recommendation:
1. Add one brown chair in cabin. But your passenger must be ‘bald’ 
2. Extend the body in 2 studs between windscreen and white window 1x4x2 panel
   - Prepare 1-pc of light gray slope brick 45 4x4 double inverted (Part no. 4854) to replace 2x4 double inverted.
   - 2 pcs of white slope brick 2x2
   - 2 pcs of white panel 1x2x2 (Part no. 4864)
   - 2 pcs of dark gray plate 1x2
3. Make the whole body balanced. Prepare 2 pcs of plate 2x2.

It was a gift from my parents, and I realise now how lucky I was to have it, seeing as it was only realeased with a couple of airlines.

It is a great set, but it only has two seats inside. You have to take off the very front roof to be able to open the plane. Nice parts, mostly plain white, but still good elements. I recommend getting it if you have the chance, for a good price, but you won't miss out on much if you don't have it your collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
