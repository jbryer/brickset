Honestly, what can you do with this? It has no real LEGO pieces, and it can't even be used next to other Galidor figures! Why can't we have good McDonalds promotions like the Tohunga, not this Galidor crap.",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2007-11-06T18:41:50.827Z","just bad","This is a very bad set. This is only an action figure with a deformed head. Also, I see that he has a prosetic arm. This just makes him look like a crazy guy you don't want to hang out with. I think you should pass this.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Cole85459","2007-10-16T16:15:24.967Z","EVERYONE HATES GALIDOR!","Tis is the worst theme Lego has ever made! Even the comics were bad! Really!

Pros:
They stopped making them

Cons:
His Head
what's that thing where his arm's supposed to be?
It looks nothing like a real Lego set
What do you do with him?

Lego, you should be ashamed of yourself. These are even worse than how people describe the new Mars Mission Aliens! (They're not that bad, but 2 pieces?!?",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T16:28:47.607Z","Error, just a error","This set is a Galidor promo from Mcdonalds. The Galidor theme does not likes lego and the pieces are unuseful, with few exceptions, like some bionicle that can use few pieces from them. This set is a small, due to be a promo, but this set is more worst than all other from the Galidor theme. It looks like a try to personalize the Nick bluetooth set in a minifigure, so, that is weird. The playability is bad but the pieces are more. I think that the Galidor theme is an error from Lego. So, i rate this 1/5 ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-10-31T16:02:01.163Z","No Lego, No way.","The Galidor theme is by far the worst Lego theme in the history of Lego. Released in 2002, it quickly became so unpopular that it was discontinued before the end of the year. McDonald's Happy Meal Lego was always lower grade quality than actual Lego, so this set is even worse.<br><br>This miniature version of Nick Bluetooth is worse than the larger version because the larger version had at least some playability what with the moving arms and legs and firing missile. However, this version is completely 100% rigid and unplayable; it is a single large piece. You can't even take the half-of-a-helmet off his head. I haven't much to say about this set other than that; the picture tells you everything.<br><br>That being said, this set is useless and I am glad they don't make sets like these anymore. It really does not fit in with Lego; the garbage can seems more appropriate.<br><br>If I could, I would give this set a 0, but that's not an option here, so I'm sticking to a 1. Even though the overall rating of this set is 1, it is nonetheless overrated and deserves something significantly lower. Now that's saying something!<br>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1

Are you kidding me? NONE!

"itsaturkey","2010-03-01T18:54:41.543Z","this set is awesome!! if its in the trash!","<p>as the title says, i'd be awesome if it were in the trash, because thats where it belongs. i remember i got my happy meal and looked inside to find my prize, only to find little haunting smile with a metal head. it was a creapy little thing, with a smile that would scare an adult. hopfully you will never have to own this set, the worst part is that lego made it, this is basicly ben 10 only smaller. never buy this set, and if you do, throw it away.</p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
"BobaFett2","2011-01-18T19:22:44.04Z","McDonalds went too far","<p>McDonalds once had ACTUAL System sets as promos. This stopped in 2000 or 1999. In 2001, they had BIONICLE, and while they were juniorized, they were quite nice, popular, and made of useful parts. In 2002, the promos got bad. At least this one can be taken apart and HAS parts, no matter how low quality and useless they are-the future promotions were all plastic toys with no building potential.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>If I remember correctly, there were instructions. I see no need for this waste of paper-it's pretty obvious how to put a head, torso, and lower section together.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I think the arms can be removed. With force. The head, torso, and feet are all separate parts. They DO fit with Galidor parts, but not perfectly. What can I say, other than piece o' junk?</p><h4>The build</h4><p>Could you possibly call sticking these three parts together a build? Boring.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Not very good looking. Doesn't really resemble Nick-why does he have such an odd helmet? And his arm isn't the same one as the set. At least you can play with this...<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Boring. Junky. Probably cheap. If you want it, you could get it very cheap (or so I suspect). But I wouldn't recommend it.<br></p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1

"Risebell","2018-07-10T00:24:45.52Z","Not your average LEGO....","<p>Alright, to really appreciate Galidor you need to approach these toys from a different angle. Yeah, these aren&#39;t LEGOs, at least, not at first glance. All the specialized pieces, no building, awkward design, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In reality though these toys have a lot of effort put into them. Galidor was meant to tackle the action figure market, and it could&#39;ve easily done so given the VERY low quality of most action figures in 2002.</p>

<p>All that said, this lil Nick is a piece of work. Perfect for little kids- An easy build, a sturdy toy, even has stud connections on the feet. Given all this Nick ranks as a 5/5 for me, he&#39;s a fantastic toy for a MCDONALD&#39;S happy meal toy.</p>
