"Daniel__","2008-01-05T13:43:56.09Z","Pretty bad...","This set is really bad. It has no bricks whatsoever except one rubber - like axle. It has no lego shaped pieces and is hard to put together. The person himself looks pretty cool. Thats the only good thing about it to me. :(",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-06-09T14:50:02.61Z","An action figure promotional","The pack of the set says that this is an action figure. It is altough don't have much playability, but this don't have much things of lego (or have only the fact that this was made by lego or have the lego logo, name and trademark). But still, the ideas of this action figure was be playable, looks like with a character from galidor and be a lego set. This don't have useful things for lego system, lego technic or lego duplo. And also, only the arms, the leg as one piece and the head moves. It can carry too a tool that this have included. This is a promotional action figure but don't have much playability and this is from lego altough this don't have useful contents for the other sets. You can want this if you like galidor, but if you like lego this isn't much a great choice, also if you like lego galidor. Still like the other galidor promotionals, a 1/5. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

I never thought it was a lego at all when I orginally owned it. I actually had two. This was fun when i was younger, but it still is a shame to be called a lego.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2008-12-10T20:55:30.34Z","Worst. Theme. Ever.","I will admit that this was one of the better ones cause the robot looked kinda cool but Galidor isn't LEGO. It just plain isn't. The robot looks kinda cool but don't get it. Honestly these things were so bad i have no idea how I got all 5. DON'T GET IT! It's not even a set!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-06-21T10:41:12.013Z","What's this? A mutant?","I'm not kidding! It looks like a mutant! Like the Nick promotional! I don't own this, but I can say that this is REALLY bad! Ugly, weird, and looks like something NO ONE will buy!

Cons:

Everything!

Pros:

Huh? NONE!

Overall, BAD set!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
