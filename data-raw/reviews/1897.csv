"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-26T07:21:40Z","I found a use for it!","The Good:
I finally have a prefab monster to fight attack my lego castle.

The Bad:
Just about the only thing lego system copatible are the way the feet fit over studs(but doesnt lock)

The Ugly:
Most people can't even tell it's a lego product. The quality is that off, even for a macdonald's release.",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"iceinatorKoPaKa","2007-12-17T11:56:58.67Z","Worst. Set. Ever!","Yeah. This set was bad, even for a happy meal toy. It, along with all of the Galidor products, was a waste of Lego's time and money. Blech...
Well lets move on to the &quot;pros&quot; and cons:
&quot;pros&quot;
none at all, although the staff is kinda cool, but, it doesn't fit in even my most dilligent experiments for Bionicle hands

cons
everything. oh did I mention everything?
I tried attaching the leg hole joint onto one of the joints in the big knights kingdom guys, and it just fell right off.

Overall: 
0 out of ten bazillion ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-06-09T18:07:28.78Z","Turn Away!","This set is a completely useless piece of junk you would find at a garage sale. It isn't Lego and looks like an action figure. If you even got this, you would only play with for 5 minutes and never play with it again. Worst Lego theme ever!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-04-23T16:30:45.36Z","Worst promo ever!","I remeber this very old promo from mcdonalds oinly because of the staff. I hate the look of the set and think gorm is indeed a creep
! He a loser in the world of galidor or whatever that junk is. Now let's rate it. 
pros:none!
cons: The whole thing!

This set is a bad set and I am glad I lost it. Now you should never get it and I hope we will never see gorm again. Now  my rating: 0 0ut of 10 zillion!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"t_17","2008-01-02T16:10:27.64Z","HORRIBLE!","All the Galidor sets are horrible!

Pros:
-none

Cons:
-looks more like a baby toy rather than Lego
-can't get even a second of fun out of it
-UGALY!
-not very flexible

An all in all, a horrible set.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-06-09T14:31:18.297Z","Gorm Promotional","This set is basically a promotional from Galidor made by lego (don't looks like be, but was made by lego) and released with happy meal in 2002. This don't looks like be from lego, and includes only four pieces. The few number of pieces is because the promotionals from happy meal don't have expensive and big things. But, the problem is that these pieces aren't compatible with technic or system, and are very strange to any creation, this is basically a set for galidor fans, but don't for lego fans (only if you is a galidor and lego fan). The strange promotional don't looks like with any lego, but still. The playability is basically moves something on this, play with the weapon or mix it with another promo from galidor. A 1/5 is the rate for this. The ideas of the set is basically be a lego promo from galidor, but it don't looks like with lego and isn't useful for creations and other lego sets.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-06-15T11:28:45.64Z","HUH?","This set is REALLY ugly! I don't own this, but the picture says everything! Gorm looks like a humanoid with prosthetic arms and a ugly head!

Cons:

EVERYTHING!

Pros:

What? NONE!

Overall, BAD set!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Berrus_Brickus","2010-11-21T10:36:06.323Z","Gorm, why does your mother hate you?","I got this set from McDonald's years ago, I might have recieved another figure with him, but I don't remember.&nbsp; Anyways he is Technic Compatible and is built, somthing you don't see with Lego/McDonald's toys anymore.&nbsp; Though, his arms and head (maybe legs) do have pins, they don't fit in with anything, somone would sooner find another use for the Throwing Rock Monster Arms, and don't suggest BIONICLE or Hero Factory, I hate Hero factory and I still don't think it deserves this rubbish.&nbsp; However, his staff is pretty cool, just look at it, he has got some kind of flower or bird with a couple of rounded parts on a stick! Pretty cool,&nbsp; huh?&nbsp; The reason I gave Value for money one brick, is because insulting McDonald's is my greatest passion (besides Legos and evil apples).&nbsp; Anyway, at least Galidor was short lived.",FALSE,1,1,1,1,1
"Cligra","2011-09-03T11:06:19.857Z","Blargh!","<p>This hideous THING was given away at McDonald's restaurants in the early 2000s', and it is without doubt the worst Galidor set ever. And based on what I've heard, that it saying something.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is a cheapo polybag, and the instructions are fantastically uninteresting and, for that matter, unneeded. The instructions do have a rather nice poster on the back (front?) side however.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>These parts are all unique, and that is a good thing, as you wont have to endure the sight of them in any other set.<br></p><h4>The build</h4><p>Nonexistent.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Yuck! Cheap, boring, and ugly.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Blargh!</p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
