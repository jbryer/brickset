I wasted huge amounts of money on Lego Galidor when I was 7, I didn't know better. Lego should make some more Mcdonalds promotions like the Matoran, not this degrading pile of crap. ",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-08-07T23:48:55.8Z","Did lego find this in megabloks' trash can?","The whole galidor theme is just sad it's not real Lego. This thing is made out of three pieces not even a weapon. The pieces don't even work for most lego pieces the feet don't fit on Lego bricks. The only thing it could be is a troll or something though it can't hold a weapon.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-07-24T17:53:41.17Z","Lame as Mega Bloks ","I don't know what Lego was thinking when they made this, but they made the wrong choice. It looks nothing like Lego and more of an action figure. Don't get me worong, but this set and the Galidor theme are just garbage. If you see one, don't get it.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-06-09T14:40:48.857Z","Another galidor promotional","I understand that this set was made to looks like with a character from galidor and is small because is a promotional, but this don't looks like with lego and isn't useful with the three pieces of this. This is very strange for any lego, technic or system (and also duplo). This set only came with the lego name, logo and trademark because was made by lego to fans of galidor. The playability of the set is only moves the arms, the head and the legs (the legs are only one piece), but don't includes more features. This promotional is basically a set for galidor fans without something useful for lego sets. The colors are cool, but colors don't means the whole rate, so this will still deserving a 1/5, like the 1.1 that it have on the total rate. This set had ideas to be a promotional of galidor by lego, but this isn't useful for lego. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"andy87","2008-11-30T11:25:02.45Z","Its ok...","The was one of the galidors i once owned, its not even a real lego. Assembly takes about three seconds to pull off. It has no playability, and its a shame it calls itself a lego at all. I never even knew that it was lego until I found these sets. Boring!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-06-21T10:31:13.513Z","How dare LEGO use a Greek-inspired name for this?!?","Really! Euripides sounds like a Greek hero! And LEGO used that name for this... monstrosity? How dare they! I don't own this, but the picture says everything!

Cons:

Everything!

Pros:

What? None!

Overall, horrible set! It's not even LEGO!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
