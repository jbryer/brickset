But, don't much, also because the legs are one piece, and the other things that can moves are only arms with the body (too as one piece) and the head. This don't includes any tool or something to hangs. And isn't useful to lego, only for the galidor promotionals to mix them, also if the combinations don't have cool results. Something that is cool on this is the color, but it don't make some effect on the final rate. The ideas of the galidor promotionals were make a promotional action figure to looks like with galidor character and be lego at the same time. This have playability, but this isn't a great one for action figures; and also don't looks like much with the character showed in the image on the pack; and too isn't useful for lego. In overall, this is good for some people, but comparing with the set's ideas it is a 1/5.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

         could switch with the other figures as well

Cons: small 
 
The reason Im not giving this a 1 is because you can actually do something with it.Also people have been complaining on why they would release such a useless thing but remember this was from a MCDONALDS HAPPY MEAL not a toysrus :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Cons:

Everything!

Pros:

Joking? NONE!

Overall, horrible set! ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0

This was a extremely poorly designed theme and just because this set is free doesn't make it any better. The only thing this is good for is to set it on your shelf and leave it there. Overall a very poor set.<br>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,5
