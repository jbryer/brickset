"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-16T11:34:05Z","Not bad","I also got a copy of this tanker in my collection. It's good but not the best. The tank is too big and unrealistic, and constructed of too big parts. The 1x6 tiles with the & Octan ;-patterns got some strange marks and looks ugly. These wagons are too short (compared with real ones). But this set contains also some good parts.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-03-06T13:34:44.653Z","Too big tanks","The two tanks are just too big. Maybe the waggon would be nicer with the bricks that are on the petrol truck in set 6562. But maybe the bricks from set 6562 are a bit too small. So it should be bricks with which you can create a tank that are not as big as the ones in set 10016 but not as small as in set 6562. The tanks of set 10016 are so big they could easily be used for a MOC: an oil refinery. 

Real tank waggons have a ladder in their middle section. But real waggons do not have two separate tanks but one big one with a possible separation inside which you cannot see from the outside (but here I am not sure). If this waggon didn't have two smaller tanks but only a big one, it would have been difficult to add the ladder. 

And yes, there are strange marks on the tile with the &quot;Octan&quot; pattern. Obviously LEGO wanted to add some signs of age. In reality new waggons don't look new forever. But some other signs of age should also be visible on the rest of the waggon. It is not logical to have the tile as the only evidence of an aging process. 

Anyway, this waggon is quite ok. A nice addition to a freight train. And there is continuity: it is an Octan waggon which comes with the classical Octan colours, namely red, green, and white. The train base is black as it is the case with most waggons. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>The tanks are large, making the car 8-wide. But it does still fit with the L-Gauge loading gauge. It also gives the tanker a beefier look.</p>

<p>The printed tiles are nice, too.</p>
