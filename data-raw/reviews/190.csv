This set may doesn't have many play features but it's still a nice and easy build. We only get a sticker for the torso of the cyclist minifig which I didn't like. These vehicles are very easy to maneuver and I can't complain much about it. As I told you in the beginning: It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
