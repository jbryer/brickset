"Blade","2008-04-22T01:31:31.937Z","NesQuick Bunny","I also sent in the NesQuick bar codes to get one of theses sets. My sister was big on the drink at that time and I wanted the model so I helped her along. The set comes in a poly bag and to my knowledge has no instructions, which I feel is quite poor. Yes I know its really simple and can be built from the bag (I just did it) but a smaller child may have had trouble and that is who theses were designed for.

The set comes with three mini-figs so it's off to a great start and also comes with a small camera car to attach the camera to. The first fig u get is the camera man, who is dressed in blue pants and hat and is wearing a white shirt. The shirt is cool as it has print on both sides and has the word Cameraman written on his back.

The second fig u get is the director, who is dressed in black pants and hat and is wearing a white shirt. The shirt is cool as it has print on both sides and has the word Director written on his back.

The third and final fig is the NesQuick Bunny who has brown pants, hands and rabbit mask over its face. The torso is yellow with the NesQuick N on the front and his head is all white with two big eyes and a mouth. The coolest bit about him is the eyes can be seen through the mask and by slightly twisting the mask it looks like he is looking around.

The Camera car is quite basic, consisting of 15 pieces, is red and white in colour, has a windscreen, headlights and tail lights. It really is just a small extra for the three figs and a place to mount the camera. Great little piece if Studios is your love.

Overall this set is quite good considering it was a promotional item, it was free, it comes with three figs and one of the figs you can only get in two sets promotionally. Due to this, I feel this set is a 6/10 or Above Average. I would say that money for value this set was excellent and if you see it around the net pick one up but don't stress out if you cant find one. A must have for collectors or Studio lovers.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
