<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Instantly recognizable for what it is.</li><li>Uses a limited piece count effectively.</li><li>Really helps flesh out your Lego Studio with the right atmosphere.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>On it's own, this set is lacking in most areas.</li></ul><div>This would be much better as just one of a larger accessories set.</div>
