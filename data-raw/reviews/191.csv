The build is very nice and easy and we also get a few stickers to worry about. What I didn't like about this set is that we have to put on stickers on the torso of the minifigs. This set has some cool stuff like a stand with 8 bottles and 4 bananas and we also get a workshop. The workshop has some nice tools, a podium where you can put the bike on and a bucket which has a brush in it. As I told you in the beginning: It's a great set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
