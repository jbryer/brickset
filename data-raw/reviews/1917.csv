<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
	<li>You may have gotten it for free. &nbsp;(Kind of a half-pro, really.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s ugly.</li>
	<li>It&#39;s not something that grabs your attention as being part of a movie set. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>As with the rest of the polybags in this series, it would have benefited from being part of a larger accessories pack... maybe.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a disappointing set that I only bought to satisfy my completist tendencies. &nbsp;But it&#39;s hard even for one like me to like.</p>
