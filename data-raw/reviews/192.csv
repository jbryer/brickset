It's an easy build and it's fun to play with as well. We also get a few stickers to worry about. We also have to put on stickers on the torso of the minifigs which I really don't like. We also get some cool stuff like a podium and 5 bikes. One of the 5 bikes is on the top of the car. The ceiling of the car can be opened very easily and in the back of the car you can see two bottles. This vehicle is very easy to maneuver as well. It's a great set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
