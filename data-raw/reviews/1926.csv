This set, the Pteranodon, was part of 24 Japan-exclusive Coca Cola promotional poly bags of which were inside bigger blind bags. They were all release in 2001 also in conjunction with Jurassic Park 3 (But they never mention this) The blind bags were a bit like the minifigure blind bags of today, except far larger and especially harder to feel up. The 24 possible sets inside could include minifigures, which would either be part of the stage crew or the actors (Unless you count the skeleton, which is supposed to be a prop), dinosaurs (3 brick built ones and a baby one, which was an individual piece) and various other builds, including trees and Coca Cola related products. None of the figures were related to anybody who was in the movie besides the director, who is obviously supposed to be Spielberg (Who created the original Jurassic Park and 2 but not the 3rd)</p>

<p>&nbsp; If you collect all 24 poly bags&nbsp;you could make a pretty good studio set up of a dinosaur movie. This is what I am currently doing.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I had gotten the Pteranodon 3 years ago along with 4078, the T-Rex as they are some of the cooler ones. I purchased them off Bricklink&nbsp;new, sealed. I recommend you also do this for not only this set but all of the 24 poly bags as for some odd reason most of them on eBay are fairly over priced (I got this one for 16 dollars but on eBay they can go for over 60 dollars!) and really there is no reason to get these used besides a slight cost decrease which could be negligible and the experience of building these for the first time is mighty fun. Let&#39;s get onto reviewing the set, and after that, the creature.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A good amount of rarer red pieces, especially the dinosaur head and the red top of tail.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Very cute!</li>
	<li>Can fit on a lot of things. The mouth allows it to rest on top of the Lego trees while looking like it&#39;s flying on it&#39;s own (Or finding itself choking on tree needles)</li>
	<li>One of the better Japanese Studios polybags.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Not much at all. I can see why people would prefer the new flying dinos&nbsp;over this as it is far more realistic. I prefer this one as it&#39;s just far more classic. I am the vintage-type guy though.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; Now, let&#39;s learn about the Pteranodon to know more about this set. The Pteranodon ruled the skies during the late Cretaceous period in North America. There are many fossil specimens of this species, more than any other pterosaur. This could mean that they were plentiful in numbers. They had very long heads, almost looking like a very slim and long banana. Their diet was full of fish, so if you have some fish pieces laying around you could give your own Pteranodon a meal. They had no teeth. If you would like to know more about the Pteranodon you could check out the wikipedia page on it.</p>

<p>&nbsp; In conclusion, the Pteranodon is very cute and a nice addition to any collection! I give this set an 8/10!</p>
