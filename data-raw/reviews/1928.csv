This set, the T-Rex, was part of 24 Japan-exclusive Coca Cola promotional poly bags of which were inside bigger blind bags. They were all release in 2001 also in conjunction with Jurassic Park 3 (But they never mention this) The blind bags were a bit like the minifigure blind bags of today, except far larger and especially harder to feel up. The 24 possible sets inside could include minifigures, which would either be part of the stage crew or the actors (Unless you count the skeleton, which is supposed to be a prop), dinosaurs (3 brick built ones and a baby one, which was an individual piece) and various other builds, including trees and Coca Cola related products. None of the figures were related to anybody who was in the movie besides the director, who is obviously supposed to be Spielberg (Who created the original Jurassic Park and 2 but not the 3rd)</p>

<p>This T-Rex could be seen as the mother of the baby T-Rex in 4079.</p>

<p>&nbsp; If you collect all 24 poly bags you could make a pretty good studio set up of a dinosaur movie. This is what I am currently doing.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I had gotten the T-Rex along with 4076, the Pteranodon as they are some of the more cooler ones in the series.&nbsp;I purchased them off Bricklink new, sealed. I recommend you also do this for not only this set but all of the 24 poly bags as for some odd reason most of them on eBay are fairly over priced (I got this one for 16 dollars but on eBay they can go for over 30 dollars!) and really there is no reason to get these used besides a slight cost decrease which could be negligible and the experience of building these for the first time is mighty fun. Let&#39;s get onto reviewing the set, and after that, the creature.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A good amount of orange pieces, especially rare ones, such as the head, top of the tail and the arms!</li>
	<li>Very cute!</li>
	<li>Charming!</li>
	<li>Is one of the better builds in the 24 poly bags.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Not much, except that they had made a massive T-Rex along with printing and improved articulation. I do still really like this one though, as it is very charming and cute.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; Let&#39;s learn more about the Tyrannosaurus Rex. They were the meanest carnivore around, chomping away to it&#39;s heart&#39;s extent during the Cretaceous period in North America. They ruled the food chain for about 20 million years yet still had very tiny arms. The arms seen in the set should&#39;ve been smaller. The arms seen makes it look more like a raptor, though I never think about that when I look at the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp; To conclude, this set is very charming and cute. I give it an overall rating of 8/10!</p>
