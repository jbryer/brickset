I was just visiting one of my friends (Who have way too many LEGO sets) and while we were chatting, I noticed a tiny Xalax figurine sitting on his Shelf. thinking it looks nice, despite having no use whatsoever for me (Not a big racer fan) I asked my friend like ""Dude, can i have this little Xalax thing?"" and he just said ""Sure, go ahead, take it."" And just like that,I Went home that day with this (seemingly) rare polybag. Later, i discovered that the figure is called ""Scratch"", And only even later that I guessed my friend must have gotten this set, since I have no evidence whatsoever that my friend had any other Xalax set.<br><br><h4>THE BUILD</h4><p>Its literally one brick.Sure, it's one specially molded, probably-never-to-be-seen-again brick, but still, this is about the build, so...I can't say much more about it.</p>0/10-What do you expect?<br><br><h4>THE PARTS</h4>&nbsp;I am quite confident that unless LEGO bring back the Xalax theme, this piece shall not be used in the near foreseeable future. But still, This piece is a highly specialized piece that have almost no other use whatsoever If only it wasn't so blocky and has feet and a steering wheel moulded into it, perhaps it could have become a monster head or something. the only remotely sane use I can think of this piece is as a pilot in a Kraang-suit contraption of some sort. I don't know.<br>4/10-It's literally just one brick.<br><br><h4>PLAYABILITY</h4>Unless you have some Xalax vehicles, this set is practically useless. It's absolutely static, like the Aldar beedo figure. It's not easy to incorporate into MOCs either, so it's almost absolutely useless.<br>2/10-Almost absolutely unplayable<br><br><h4>VALUE FOR MONEY</h4><p>got it for free, So it is definitely worth the value. sure, it's a lame set, but I never turn down a free LEGO set, and since everyone who have this set (11 on brickset, at time of writing, including me) (presumably) Practically got it for free, I don't think I am an isolated case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8/10-Yay! free LEGO set!<br></p><br>All in all it's a lame set. for any price above free I would HIGHLY dis-recommend you from getting it.<br><br><br><br>",TRUE,2,1,1,1,4
