<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of colours!</li><li>Contains 2 Duplo plates!</li><li>Contains bricks with printed eyes!</li><li>Hard to loose Duplo bricks! (Obviously.)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not many bricks!</li><li>No&nbsp;minifigures!</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>This wasn't one of those bad sets. It was the only set I got that had Duplo plates, (2x4,) so that is one of the reasons why it scored high. There isn't much else to say, other than that it contains some bricks with eyes.</p><p>Overall,&nbsp;great&nbsp;for a very little kid, but also for a big one who is making a Duplo&nbsp;Brick bust.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,2
