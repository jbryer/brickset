Technic bricks with studs means that not half the set consists of the pins needed to click beams together like in the recent Technic series. As a consequence there's ample room (at this price point) for a slew of nice modelling parts like slanted bricks, antennas, wedges and wings. IMHO definately outclasses the current Technic series.

Other plusses: great colour scheme and topic flavour, very neat booklet with some nifty creations, and the cuteness factor.

Small minus: only detailed instructions for 6 of the 15 suggested creations are given. Especially the somewhat complicated lobster/scorpion? needed some kludging to get something resembling the pictures.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

LEGO needs to do some marketing I think. Kids still love it, but they don't ask their parents for it because they always ask for whatever's being advertised on TV.

C'mon LEGO, do your part. Brag a little. Generate some excitement!

i would recomend it if you like that kind of thing",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"stitch","2008-02-11T12:16:52.7Z","cool parts!","I got this set for christmas some years ago. It has alot of cool pieces you can use for robot and stuff like that. The only con is that some of them are hard to build and the ones that use robe are hard to find a place to tie. Example the bird can fly on the string but it is hard to fin a place to put the string.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
