It works if I wound the motor up, but not much. Now though, it seems as if it doesn't work at all; when wound up, the motor works then stops a second later. It has many cool models though, including the smoothie-maker, a safe, and even a dice-roller! It also has a paddle; useful. Now, here are the pros and cons:

Pros:

Cool models
Nice smoothie-maker
Cool safe
Dicer-roller(NOT intended for poker, I guess)

Cons:

Motor is weak
Rubber bands are the old ones, which break easily

Overall, a great set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
