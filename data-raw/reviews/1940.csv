MONKEY THINGY: 9/10. Overrated. NOt as good as it sounds. Worth building, though. The claws on it falll off the string easily.

VERTICAL BIRD WALKER: 5/10. Horrible. DOESN'T WORK!
( I think it's a bird, but I'm not sure)

STIRRING THINGY*: 10/10. Great. ACTUALLY mixes stuff. I made it mix me an ovaltine. Swell thing. MY FAVORITE MODEL IN THIS AREA.

BIRD/DOG THINGY THAT WALKS: 10/10. 2nd favorite model. I especially like that they dressed up the battery pack as a dog. REALLY nice.

WALKER: 9/10. No instructions. If there were instructions, I would of made it so it turned out better.

POWER DRILL (no instructions): 8/10. Okay, but not the best.

I made an airplane with my set that wasn't in the instructions, and it gets a 80/10. 

* Yes, there really is a stirrer in this set.
