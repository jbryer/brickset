Parlez vous anglais?","        I have no idea what the guy before me was saying (I only speak English and Spanish) but I cannot believe the total review average was a 3.2. This set was pretty good because you can record what you want the thing to do and then just let go and start it up. The bad part about this is that although the LEGO Club was probably angling for a younger Mindstorms kind of thing, you knew exactly where your invention was going to go, so it could get a little boring. Again, the instruction booklet had a very wide variety of creations that were fun to build and sometimes useful. There were also plenty of elements included, but almost all green, black, or tan. Overall, decent.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-06-01T16:58:44.937Z","I agree with Master Builder, what is he saying?!?","Strange guy there... anyways, here's my review: This set has a huge brick with circuits inside and two buttons: press the red button, move it around, and it'll ""remember"" the movements. Press the green button, and it'll play back the movements. Keep the ""play"" button pressed, and it'll change between three modes:

1. Normal mode
2. Reverse mode
3. Repeat mode

Their names are pretty self-explanatory:). It even has a green axle hole on the outside that turns automatically on the ""play"" feature. The models themselves are quite nice. The main model(not pictured here), reminds me of the Eighties movie robot Johnny 5. One model is a drummer, another is a kind of writer(which, if I remember well, didn't work well), and another is a dog. Also, there's something surprising: It needs three AA batteries, which, even after months, never wear off. Maybe it's the model of the batteries, but anyways, that's handy.  Now, onto the pros and cons:

Record and Play feature
Nice models
Useful green and lime green parts
Wheels from old the Technic series ""Competition""
Batteries don't wear off easily

Cons:

The rubber bands are the old-style ones, which break easily

<p>In 2003, LEGO released 4 sets under the name&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Creator/subtheme-Inventor-Set"">&quot;Inventor&quot;</a>&nbsp;(now considered a subtheme of Creator) with different kinetic or motorised mechanisms.&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4095-1/Record-and-Play"">4095</a>&nbsp;Record and Play is one of these. The others are&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4090-1/Motion-Madness"">4090</a>&nbsp;Motion Madness (the bird zip-wiring on the packaging certainly looks mad; why couldn&rsquo;t it fly instead?),&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4093-1/Wild-Wind-Up"">4093</a>&nbsp;Wild Wind-Up (consisting of a drinks mixer resembling a squirrel and another squirrel that might be useful for clearing leaves, or snow if you manage to get some) and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4094-1/Motor-Movers"">4094</a>&nbsp;Motor Movers (a bizarre-looking motorised monkey with exclusive tail also enjoys zip-wiring across the box art). All except&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4095-1/Record-and-Play"">4095</a>&nbsp;were August releases, this one released in September. But returning to the subject in hand, these sets are a bit obscure. Very little can be found about them online other than the most basic information, but we do know who designed them: J&oslash;rn Thomsen and Steen Sig Andersen. Alas, their BrickLists give away nothing.</p>

<h2>Overview and Packaging</h2>

<p>I bought this set in 2017 off eBay for somewhere around &pound;24. I think I found it by accident while browsing.</p>

<p>It retailed for &pound;39.99 in the UK and for $50 in the US. It contains 345 parts and can be bought used on eBay UK for at least &pound;40, and on BrickLink for around &pound;40 in Europe. The set is recommended for ages 7+.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Box%20Front.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>My box looks good for its age, and you can see several of the other builds highlighted on the back.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Box%20Rear.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Barring some fading on the front cover, my manual is also in good condition. It&rsquo;s exceedingly thick and weighs over 400g. Pages 2&ndash;3 list the different builds they have instructions for, of which there are six.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Manual%20Front%20Cover.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There are also six &quot;ideas&quot; which instructions are not provided for, but there are enough images to work from. All twelve builds will be covered in this review, in order of appearance.&nbsp;<strong>Build</strong>&nbsp;means it has instructions;&nbsp;<strong>Idea</strong>&nbsp;means images only.</p>

<h2>The Parts</h2>

<p>The wonders of what you can get from less than 350 parts! There are some parts in old grey and old dark grey, plenty of green technic beams (up to 16-long), several uncommon parts in lime green, two see-through gearboxes, four black rubber bands (only two are shown because a pair went missing, since replaced) and of course the recording brick.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Parts.png/640x480.png"" /></p>

<p>The recording brick is moulded in brick yellow and old dark grey, with two buttons on top. It uses 3x AA batteries. You can find it quite cheap on BrickLink. The red RECORD button records movements up to 20 seconds. Pressing it again will stop recording. The green PLAY button plays back the recording and when pressed down hard can switch between three modes:&nbsp;<a href=""http://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Car%20GIF%201.GIF"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab..

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Motor.png/640x327.png"" /></p>

<p>The later pages of the manual describe the motor&rsquo;s workings in several languages. The white dot on top is the RESET button. Turning off the motor will not delete the recording, but pressing RESET or removing the batteries will, as will recording a new &quot;routine&quot;.</p>

<p>There are only two motor ports, but if you use the gearboxes, lime wheels and other parts a fair number of different movements are possible. The trans-green port at the front is an &quot;additional start function&quot;.</p>

<h2>The Builds</h2>

<h3>Build 1: Grasshopper</h3>

<p>Even with the bulky recording brick integrated, this is an instantly recognisable rendition of a grasshopper, and I like the cartoonish look of it. With a minifigure for scale, you can see that it has some presence, mostly due to that great big recording brick and its charming face.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Grasshopper%201.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Here it is from behind:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Grasshopper%202.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The wheels cause the &quot;legs&quot; to move up and down much like the piston on a steam locomotive, driving it forward. I award this model&nbsp;<b>5.0</b>, because I find that face so charming to look at. It also makes excellent use of the green parts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Grasshopper%203.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Idea 1: What?</h3>

<p>This next build is the first one LEGO&nbsp;<i>don&#39;t</i>&nbsp;provide instructions for. I was able to assemble it from several images in about half an hour.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Dragonfly-Thingy%201.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The question is, what is it? A dragonfly? A lizard of some sort? A Google image search did nothing to solve the mystery, finding images of 75091 Flash Speeder. It has wings, legs like the grasshopper, an unusual head&hellip; In the end, it appears either to be some sort of leafhopper or a dragonfly. Or is it a deformed woodpecker? Strangely, the next build is disfigured as well.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Dragonfly-Thingy%202.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>It leaves much to be desired in the functions department. The images suggest that it might work similarly to the grasshopper, but it doesn&#39;t. That lime green bit underneath (seen in the first photo) reduces the ground clearance, impeding its progress across hard surfaces and carpets. If that bit falls off, it will suddenly halt.</p>

<p>I award this build&nbsp;<b>3.0</b>, because it is barely identifiable as anything and has an annoying flaw, but the head is nice.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Dragonfly-Thingy%203.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Build 2: Three-wheeled disabled dog</h3>

<p>This build is quite possibly the worst-looking thing in this set. The face isn&#39;t too bad but is spoilt by the large tan plate sticking out with the tongue. The curvature of the lower jaw ends too abruptly.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Dog%201.JPG/640x480.JPG"" /></p>

<p>At this point I switched to a proper background and lost the red minifigure (a yellow one kindly filled in for it), but it does crop up again later. The drooping ears improve the build, and are otherwise only used on the drummer (at the end of this review) and whatever that last build was.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Dog%202.JPG/640x480.JPG"" /></p>

<p>The tail is a different story. It looks like something from a preschool toy. The transparent gearbox doesn&#39;t help. The wheels make it look like a dog with amputated rear legs, but it looks like this one had all its legs amputated. I shudder to think of what happened. It must have been involved in some accident.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Dog%203.JPG/640x480.JPG"" /></p>

<p>It should move forward, but that &quot;castor wheel&quot; at the back causes it to sway about. I award this build the low score of&nbsp;<b>2.5</b>. The head is the only thing making me give it a higher score than&nbsp;<b>2.0</b>.</p>

<h3>Idea 2: Car with exposed engine</h3>

<p>This is the only idea I had built prior to deciding to review this set. The engine is so visible that it looks like something out of a Haynes manual, only they forgot to indicate where the cutaway ends.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Car%201.JPG/640x480.JPG"" /></p>

<p>When the pistons are aligned correctly, the car moves well. If not, the engine will rip itself apart or the vehicle will stop. I&#39;m not completely sure if I&#39;ve got the rear bumpers right, because there is no image of the back of it.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Car%202.JPG/640x480.JPG"" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, I forgot to include the minifigure in the photos of this model! The crankshaft at the front is smartly connected to the trigger port.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Car%203.JPG/640x480.JPG"" /></p>

<p>I award&nbsp;<b>4.0</b>&nbsp;because it doesn&#39;t look too bad, but the engine is too exposed in my eyes. Haynes can keep it.</p>

<h3>Idea 3: Another obscure creature (pond skater?)</h3>

<p>Here we are again, another hard-to-identify creature. At least this build is more likely to be something from the insect kingdom. After several minutes of deliberation, I decided that it was a pond skater. It could be a froghopper, of course, but it bears a closer resemblance to the former. Or is it a bearded dragon with two antennae and funny legs?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Pond%20Skater%201.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>It also took me a while to reverse-engineer it from the photographs, about an hour I should think. Its legs move around, but it cannot go anywhere. It looks like an attempt to make it appear to &quot;swim&quot;.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Pond%20Skater%202.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The instructions make me wonder if the instructions team were told what it was, because it is pictured going across land.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Pond%20Skater%203.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Just don&#39;t do this, I beg of you. I would advise those of a nervous disposition to scroll past this next image:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Pond%20Skater%204.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Please, only do this if you want to replace the batteries. You can see why the spaceman has changed his face! It&#39;s a wonder he hasn&#39;t turned into a white one! I just hope no taxidermists read Brickset.com. I&#39;ll keep this set hidden away just in case&hellip;</p>

<p>This build earns&nbsp;<b>4.5</b>&nbsp;stars because I like the design. Absolutely not because it can be potentially used to give someone a fright.</p>

<h3>Build 3: Draughtsman</h3>

<p>The torso section leaves much to be desired, but a few unused parts can help fill up that unsightly gap: 1x lime&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-3048"">End Ridged Tile 1x2/45&deg;</a>&nbsp;and 1x green 1x4 brick. Sorry for the hair in the bottom corner of that photo.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Draughtsman%201.jpeg/640x480.jpeg"" /></p>

<p>That&#39;s better. If I remember correctly, this was the first build I built when I got this set. According to the images in the instructions, you&#39;re&nbsp;<i>supposed</i>&nbsp;to be able to make drawings (of sorts) with this one. This is done by sliding a piece of paper through the roller (like the kind found on a typewriter) and securing a pen in place using the rubber band.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Draughtsman%203.jpeg/640x480.jpeg"" /></p>

<p>The arm is used to move the pen horizontally across the paper, and the roller moves the paper to create vertical lines. I tested it with a red pen, but the results were weird to say the least. I tried it again with a thick black marker and ended up with designs one might call &quot;minimalist&quot;, because there isn&#39;t much to observe. I might have been better off with a ballpoint pen or a marker with a thin nib.&nbsp;<a href=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Draughtsman%20GIF.gif"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab.. Link to external website, opens in a new tab.. Link to external website, opens in a new tab.. Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">Here is a test</a>&nbsp;with a thicker pen.</p>

<p>Here are the drawings. As you can see, they aren&#39;t exactly something worth placing in an art gallery. You couldn&#39;t even call them modern art. This build earns a score of&nbsp;<b>1.5</b>&mdash;for effort.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/4095%20Draughtsman%20Drawings.png/640x326.png"" /></p>

<h3>Idea 4: A third unusual creature</h3>

<p>This build initially looked complex, but not as bad as the froghopper/pond skater-thingy. It was in fact easier, but it did take a bit longer to build.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/20220312_174618752_iOS.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>When I tried testing it a few days later, it turned out it needed new batteries, and after finding some that weren&#39;t out of juice, I tested it. I had already figured out what it did near the end of building and had tested it without batteries. The bits at the front that vaguely resemble the scrapers on an ice-resurfacing machine move closer together and then apart again as it moves forward. Now here&#39;s a thought&mdash;could those bits on the front make it a leafcutter ant? Here it is in action.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/20220312_174704671_iOS.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>It&#39;s a very intricate model, possibly the most parts-intensive one of the lot! This one is a great build, and I award it&nbsp;<b>4.5</b>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/20220312_174746508_iOS.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Build 4: Can-grabbing beetle</h3>

<p>This one is also very parts-intensive, perhaps even more so than the last build. It is also the only main build I had never built before starting this review. It appears to be a black beetle, since it has a claw. It is designed to grasp things with the claw at the front and move them. You open the claw by hand, place the object within it, let the rubber band snap it back into place and let it slide it along whatever surface it is on. It cannot pick things up, only slide.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-12-12-10-50-305~2.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I discovered this by trying to make it pick up a plastic mister. It was very loose in its grasp. Then I tried a can of Tango. It gripped that well! And finally, I tried getting it to move most of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31051-1/Lighthouse-Point"">31051</a>&nbsp;Lighthouse Point, which happens to be the width of a can, hoping that it would hold it up by the ridges on the side. It didn&#39;t, but it did slide it well across my building table!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-12-12-12-20-114~2.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>It looks neater because of a Plate 6X6 used to cover up the buttons on top, held in place by the surrounding pieces.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-12-12-14-44-740~2.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I award this build&nbsp;<b>5.0</b>&nbsp;stars. It looks great, and functions great too.</p>

<h3>Idea 5: Technic beam-flinging-thingy</h3>

<p>This build appears to be in here just to fill up some extra pages. Either that, or it&#39;s very pernickety about its 10-long technic beams and just flings the unwanted ones away. Maybe the discarded ones have too many tooth-marks or are 1/200<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of a millimetre short (the exact accuracy of a LEGO moulding machine is 1/200<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;of a millimetre).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-13-09-48-17-916.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There are six of those beams in the set, and it can fling two at once. It takes some practice to get it right, one arm in mid-air and one ready to spring. You must also get the timing right, so you don&#39;t move the arms too fast.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-13-09-49-20-859.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The table-like platform that you place the beams on is only held by technic axles, and can be tipped over very easily. I would advise placing the arms beneath the table, so the beams don&#39;t fall off when you put them on.</p>

<p>Should be should you want to build it (which you probably don&#39;t), the pins holding the ears in place are the Brick Yellow ones.</p>

<p>I award this build&nbsp;<b>1.5</b>&nbsp;because it doesn&#39;t do much, and it doesn&#39;t look great either. Superfluous is the word I&#39;m thinking of. It is completely useless. An exercise in futility.</p>

<h3>Build 5: Robot squirrel with motors for feet?</h3>

<p>That description is the only thing I can think of that describes this. Originally, it didn&#39;t occur to me that it might be a robot, but now it makes sense. It doesn&#39;t have handlebars, it has grilles on the front, but the head just reminds me of a squirrel. I think it&#39;s the mouth and the ears. Unless it&#39;s a robot chipmunk.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-13-16-44-19-535~2.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Whatever it is, it doesn&rsquo;t have a tail, so maybe it isn&rsquo;t any of those things! After all, why should any robot look like that? And where are the handlebars? Did someone forget them? Well, this may not be the most accurate depiction of a motorcycle and its rider/squirrel I&rsquo;ve ever seen, if it is indeed that, but it is an interesting looking build, nonetheless.</p>

<p>I award this build&nbsp;<b>4.0</b>&nbsp;because it looks interesting, but not because it is in any way an accurate portrayal of a squirrel. I think&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4093-1/Wild-Wind-Up"">4093</a>&nbsp;Wild Wind-Up does better. Maybe the designers were running out of ideas for squirrel faces by the time they got to&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4095-1/Record-and-Play"">4095</a>.</p>

<h3>Idea 6: Card-dealer with Groucho eyebrows</h3>

<p>First, let&#39;s get this comparison out of the way:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-14-16-14-39-925.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Now compare it to&nbsp;<a href=""https://tenor.com/en-GB/view/eyeroll-marx-brothers-gif-11045303"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab.. Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">this</a>.</p>

<p>The face on this model seems to be a caricature of Groucho Marx, sans moustache. Anyway, I originally thought when I first saw this build in the instructions that it was supposed to&nbsp;<i>shuffle</i>&nbsp;the cards. Fast-forward a bit and I realise that it is supposed to&nbsp;<i>deal</i>&nbsp;them instead. It certainly looks the part. The rubber bands might be able to do something. And it uses another steam locomotive-inspired system to move the &quot;arms&quot; at the front in a circular motion.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-14-16-15-11-619.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t find a normal pack of playing cards so had to use one with garden birds decorating them instead. It does look nice, though. The dealing action sort-of works, to the extent of being able to slide the cards away from the main pile but not actually deal them into individual stacks. You would have to grab the amount needed for a stack from the end of the new pile, followed by the next player, and so on, instead. It might be easier to get an actual human to do it for you instead.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-14-16-19-21-407.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Not the best-working model, but the thought is there, so I give it&nbsp;<b>4.0</b>&nbsp;stars for effort.</p>

<h3>Build 6: The goofy-looking drummer</h3>

<p>Drum roll, please! Roll up, roll up, come to the latest concert performed by the newest sensation, Goofy the Drummer, at the LEGO Amphitheatre on 4095 Clutch Avenue!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-15-15-57-11-683.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This final build, if I remember correctly, was the second build I constructed (after the draughtsman from earlier), and this, followed by the car and the grasshopper, is the one I have built the most times. Ignoring the goofy-looking head and the lonely strands of hair (although some musicians do have hair like that), this build doesn&#39;t look too bad compared to some sillier-looking designs we&#39;ve already seen. Just try to ignore the spindly legs. I dimmed the lights to add some atmosphere.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-15-15-57-31-808.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The function is obvious: the two drumsticks are supposed to hit the white cymbals and the black bit that can move slightly because it is connected to a rubber band and some other parts. I know that sentence was a bit wordy. It is sometimes difficult to hit the black thing, but it hits the cymbals quite easily (and occasionally knocks them over). The noise it generates isn&#39;t exactly musical, but it&#39;s about as musical a noise as you can get simply thumping three LEGO parts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-15-15-57-40-858.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The clicking sound of LEGO bricks, the sound of parts being spilled on the floor, the sound of ratchet joints and the sound of rummaging through a box of LEGO bricks is the most musical you can get with LEGO bricks at all. Combined though, you might get some sort of rhythm.</p>

<p>Anyway, I award this final&nbsp;<b>3.5</b>&nbsp;build stars.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://bricksafe.com/files/Giraffe20/review-4095-record-and-play/IMG_2022-04-13-16-56-54-645~2.jpg/640x480.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This set is an unusual oddity from the dark ages of LEGO, when many sets left you asking the question: why? However, it is a set with good functions that is fun to mess around with! The building experience is varied, but not too complex (hence a score of&nbsp;<b>4</b>). The parts selection is interesting with plenty of parts in uncommon colours and a ton of technic beams in green, and of course the exclusive recording brick, so I award it&nbsp;<b>5</b>. The playability is fine, but you will probably find yourself building something new sooner or later since there is not much each build can do, but if you use the wheels, gears and gearboxes well enough you might be able to come up with something that lasts a bit longer. I give a score of&nbsp;<b>4</b>.</p>

<p>As regards value, the set originally cost &pound;39.99, which now equates to roughly &pound;66, according to the Bank of England. The price seems a bit steep, but several parts appear in uncommon colours and there is the unique recording brick to factor in as well. Thinking of a recent set,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71360-1/Adventures-with-Mario"">71360</a>&nbsp;Adventures with Mario costs &pound;55, has 231 parts and the electronic Mario, and yet this has more parts and you can create more with it, so the value holds up, and I rate it&nbsp;<b>5</b>. The value was excellent at the price I got it, for certain! And with the box!</p>

<p>Overall, I give this set a score of&nbsp;<b>5</b>. It should keep young would-be engineers entertained, and AFOLs might be interested in experimenting with the recording brick and re-using the green technic beams in their own models.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed reading this review as much as I enjoyed writing it, and now maybe a Throwback Thursday article on these sets is in order? If so, my images are at your disposal. But I think an interview with the designers might be needed to give the theme some backstory!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for now! :-)</p>
