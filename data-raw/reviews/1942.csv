"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-28T08:18:29Z","Amazing","With over 200 pieces and 40 examples (although only 13 models are thoroughly explained) and a relatively low cost, it is one of the best boxes of the last few years.
Actually, small kids will sink their teeth in the instructions booklet, but everybody else will try to reach their imagination's limit, thanks to the many different pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-05T11:39:26Z","Great little vehicles","I just bought this yesterday. Normally I'm taking reviews of all or some of the models, but this has too much for doing it that way. The whole set has a little bit over 200pcs at a rather low price of 15â‚¬. The set has Ideas for 40 models and instructions for 13 of them, but when searching through brickshelf and other related sites you find many more and even some more instructions if you search carefully. So this set has extremely much variety of models even outside the instructions. The only thing I don't like so is, that there isn't anything at 
Minifig-Scale, but the creations are so small, that this isn't a big drawback. But with some ideas even minifig-scale creations can be build. So overall a great smaller designer set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
