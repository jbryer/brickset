It was very expensive 18.50â‚¬, which is about 23$ but it was worth it.The Idea Book gives Ideas and Instructions for 32 Models out of the 219 parts.Another nice fact is, that you can have up to 3 Models at the same time.And there are no juniorized parts in that set.Mostly 1980ish to early 1990ish parts.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-26T20:50:59Z","Great !!","I always wanted this set since it was released in 2003.. but it was the release of the x-pods that got me into this mecha-style lego... THIS is the way to build robots, not bionicle!! ( I H&#198;TE bionicle ) I got this, the green robot from the xpods, the REALLY big titan xp, and a duracell battery pack lego robot set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T03:27:57Z","What a great set!","I bought this set a year ago and I'm still enjoy looking at it. (Right, after building it, i won't tear them up to construct other models. A bit wasting, I know).

Nice display set together with 4099 (Robobots), 4508 (Titan Xp) and 4881 (Robo Platoon).

Play on.

Okay, maybe hat last sentence was pushing it, but there are some great parts just waiting to be used in that box. So, the 'Robots' are nothing special, it's the parts that make this so good!
I've only given it a 4 because a 5 would mean it is a must buy superb 10/10 set, which obviously it ain't.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
