"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-28T08:12:23Z","Perfect!","Beautiful box, with many small and original pieces. The instructions are for small boys but as I have a 4 year old son, this is okay. Bigger guys (as me) will be delighted to try new creations with its nearly 200 pieces.
I really love the blue and white combination, and never grow tired of it. The many pieces and the low cost make this box a must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-31T23:39:52Z","Great!","I got this set (his first lego set) for my son who is nearly 4, and it is fantastic! He loves making the many designs and the instructions are very clear so he can do it himself, there are enough alternative models so he never gets bored and the models are really realistic so they look great. What's more the instructions really teach building skills and encourage imaginative building, so he now makes lots of models from his imagination: x-wing fighters, space ships, and even little people, and I really see him using the techniques he learnt from the instructions so his models are quite sophisticated and well-designed. He plays with it for hours every day and  it is a fantastic set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
