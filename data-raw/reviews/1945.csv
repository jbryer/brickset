The number of parts in this set makes it a bargain. The number of plates is overwhelming here. Hinge selection is also great, providing a treasure of click hinges for those who need stable articulation.

Bad
The articulation relies too heavily on click hinges that do not offer much movement. Also, since Robobots was meant to be a ""larger"" version of Mini Robots thus I expected significantly bigger robots in the alternate instructions booklet.

Main robot
At 9 inches tall, this guy can stand toe to toe with its Bionicle counterparts. However, the use of click hinges make this guy cumbersome to do action poses. The design is also quite ugly, lacking the appearance of a ""real"" mecha and the randomness of the parts, especially the arms. 

Final Rating: 7
Excellent parts selection and cheap; but for a Designer Set, design is lacking.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The only down fall to this set is the lack of main structural pieces. Ya cant build stuff outta just hinges!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-06T16:17:37Z","Good robot,but a bit ugly","This set is cool,but the main robot seems to be a bit ugly.But it's more beautiful then some of the alternates.Well at it's height of about 25cm it's overlooking my 3 little mini robo guys,but the smaller ones are a little more beatiful.Well but for pieces it's a good source to build some small to medium Mecha-MOCs.
And it's not juniorized.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-10-11T14:38:55.013Z","Click hinge galore!","Yep, there are a lot of click hinges and normal hinges here! The main robot(not pictured) is pretty big, and has arm and leg articulation, can rotate around the waist, and its head can turn around and dip down! There are also chrome antenae and spikes! Now, onto the pros and cons:

Pros:
Click hinges
Hinges
Chrome pieces
Cool robots

Cons:
None!

Overall, a very good set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dk_devilkid","2009-12-26T21:55:44.53Z","My first ever lego set. ","I can't say my fav robot to make because I do love most of them. The best thing about this set though is the pieces it comes with. My favorite pieces are the gun looking one and the shield/satelite dish. Both of the those are on the bottom left robot on the pic above.

Pros:
49 really cool robots.
Awesome pieces.

Cons:
Not many robots can be made at a time.

Overall this was a great starter set to get me into lego.I would get this set if you like building robots or want cool pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rider9437","2010-01-04T20:55:15.89Z","One of my first...","This was one of my first Lego sets I got, and I had ALOT of fun building and playing with all of the robots. You can build the large model and play with it or make several small ones and have them battle. Or just make up your own.  Now the pieces have made a great edition to my collection. If you can find this set on ebay or somwhere else I would recommend getting it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
