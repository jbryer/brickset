"A_Brickset_user","2003-05-28T00:00:00Z","","This is an excellent standalone set that shows what can be done with a good selection of Lego along with creative building.  The picture above does not do justice to the many impressive models contained in the instruction manual.  Notable alternate models include two firetrucks, a formula one car, a wide body dump truck, a semi trailer with a submarine, a pickup truck with a glider, a couple of tow trucks, a sports car, a fork lift, a combine/harvester with a tractor and trailer hitch.  Instructions are not included for all models shown.  It also appears that multiple models (shown on the same page) can be made at the same time which increases the fun factor.  Youngsters can start with the basic models and then progress to more complex versions of similar vehicles as their interest grows.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-08T01:46:13Z","Great value and investment.","This is one of the better, if not best, Lego sets. Many of the pieces are more versatile than the ones you find in, say, World City sets. Many of the pieces are wheels, plates, and bricks. There are some lights and windows and vent things. Unlike other sets (such as World City), this Lego set lets your mind run wild. With World City sets, it's hard to come up with something else because they're mostly customized pieces. With this designer set, most of the pieces are generic, ergo it's easy to make something else. You'll probably never even look in the instruction booklet. I know I didn't.

Plus, at eight cents a pieces, it's a pretty good value. Next time, I'm going to get the other designer set (the one with the yellow semi + flatbed truck. It's only 9.99 and has 200 pieces! 5 cents a piece!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-06T16:26:17Z","Good,but ...","Well it's a good set,but there are some pieces,that are a bit big.And it's lacking a steering wheel and Minifig-Scaled Models,they're all a little smaller than 
Minifig-scale,which I don't like so.But if you let your imagination running around and if you fetch a minifig and a steering Wheel,you can really build some Mnifig-scaled Models out of it.I like the clear Windows,which I haven't seen much in sets of the 90's or newer.Well the wheel holders and the wheels itself are a little simplified,but unlike in the juniorized sets from 1997 to 2000,they're useful.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

MAIN TRUCK WITH SUBMARINE: 9/10. Only bad thing is that there isn't much playability. EXCELLENT structual integrity.

TOW TRUCK  AND SEMI TRUCK (mini): 10/10 for sure. If they could give it a trailer, It would get a 11/10. Still fun.

FORKLIFT: 12/10. One of me favorite models in the book. Lift works like a charm.

PICKUP WITH PLANE: 8/10. PLANE ROCKS! (only bad part is no instructions) (just pictures)

RALLY CAR AND DUNE BUGGY: 10/10. GREAT job with this part, TLC. I am so excited that it could be build symoltainiously.

TOW-TRUCK: (BIG), 10/10. fUN.

MOTORCYCLE: 3/10. Aweful. Just aweful. NO INSTRUCTIONS! REALLY HARD TO BUILD! (maybe if I'm going to get instructions for it, it would of turned out better).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"vanurk","2005-05-19T08:56:19Z","good ? bad ? you say so..","well .. lets start (I only build the large truck)
-the design looks really good.. only not minifig-accesable
-its the right scale
-the colors just rock
-the submarine is just sweet... I only lost the right lamp

yes if: you got plenty of money
        you collect designer sets

"jonbuddy","2009-01-30T16:54:15.5Z","One of my favorites.","I truly love this Creator (I'm sorry- ""Make and Create.""). It's a great way to get red and white pieces and also Wheels and Axles. I bought it at Sears a while back, but it wasn't back in 2003 when I bought it. It was like '06 or '07.

Good:
Endless possibilities- not just 35!
Great creations
Easy to build
Easy to imagine more creations
Crane pieces
A good way to get red and white pieces (as I've mentioned above)
Windshield piece(s)
Plenty of Wheels and Axles

Bad:
NOTHING!

Overall:
A great set-buy it!

"RandomReviewerBros","2015-08-03T12:52:31.127Z","Oh the Memories...","<p>I just felt like writing a review on this set as I have the fondest memories of this set, I would have been 5 years old when I got this and it was the first proper LEGO set I&nbsp;ever received after Duplo. The memories I have are happy and sad at the same time and this review will be based purely off what I remember as a kid playing with this set with my Dad.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The parts in this set are great, I still have them all to this day but they are mixed in with thousands of other parts Ive gotten since...</p>

<p>Like all Creator sets there is a wide variety of parts and styles of parts, you can take a look at the inventory&nbsp;above :)</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This is the fun part, back in the day 12 years ago, Creator sets offered way more than just the &quot;3 in 1&quot; they offer today. There were 35 different possibilities of creations and the instruction booklet offered just that, albeit some were small but at least they gave you the option of many creations.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Now for the completed model I&#39;m going to go back to my favorite&nbsp;memory of this set, you can see the truck on the photo provided by Brickset above, that was the biggest model and as a 5 year old you thought that 299 pieces was a lot (at least compared to the size of sets I build today) and my dad would help me build the truck and I remember being so happy and proud of myself when I finished it, its a very happy memory for me but at the same time sad because of how fast my life has seemed to go...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I myself have rated this set 5 stars across the board based purely off the fact of the amazing memories I have with this set, I do recommend it for a younger kid who is starting out with LEGO and I&#39;m sure it doesn&#39;t go for too much online :)</p>
