"ratz","2007-03-28T05:51:04.473Z","a good start","if i remember correctly this was the first designer set dealing with animals back in 2003. so one might think the line started slowing and got better, but the contrary is the case: this set is excellent in every aspect: very wide brick selection with lots of special parts and colours and adorable models. 
apart from the animals you see on the picture provided here you can also build a brown ant, a red-orange crab and other smaller animals, each of them being unique in appearance and character. so if you can manage to get this set, don't miss it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

PROS:

 - great for kids

CONS:
 - NONE

"Batmaniam","2009-03-03T17:08:19.153Z","Great Fun!","This set is very nice. I got it when I was 8 or 10, and it was a lot of fun. There are lots of nice pieces, and colours. Plus you can make tons of different animals, some at the same time even!I really like the spider, the crab, and the ant are cool too. I have the crab crusher subarmine set, so now I have to crabs, but the aqua raiders one looks best. Very good, fairly old, and lots of fun. If you see it get it.

"Alemas","2010-03-10T12:44:22.013Z","Hinge Galore!","<h4>Overview </h4>This set was launched in 2003, the year in which LEGO Make and Create was launched. It's in the same style as the modern Creator sets, only with multiple models instead of just 3. As you can see in the picture above(or beside this review), this set has 63 creations: some of them are inspiration models, some have their own instructions. <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span><h4>Building Experience</h4>Where shall I begin? There are loads of models to create! In this set, the creations are animal-themed(hence the name), with insects, lizards, and even a BIG HAIRY SPIDER(ok, not really hairy)! 5/5<br><h4>Parts</h4>Woah... there are a lot of click hinges, a lot of BRICK click hinges, normal hinges, some transparent wings, and lots of bright colours! Oh, BTW, this set contains a surprise: A brick separator! Also, this has a single 1X3 brick in... dark pink. 5/5<br><h4>Playability</h4>Depends on the model you build. All of them are pretty good though, so this set scores highly. 5/5<br><h4>Value for Money</h4>Â£24.99... pretty good for what you get! 5/5<br><h4>Pros</h4>   Good models<br>Lots of great parts    <br>A brick separator(always useful) <br>   Great playability for all models <br>   Good value for money&nbsp;    <br><h4>Cons</h4>None!&nbsp; <br><h4>   Overall</h4>A very good set. Lots of good models, great parts, and a brick separator make this set very good indeed. Highly recommended!",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
