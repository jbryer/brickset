Nothing fancy, but it does come with a book with ideas that are perfect for a young beginner who is first learning how to put Lego together. The big plastic bucket is also nice for the first time owner because it is a place for them to put their bricks when they aren't playing with them.

As I said, the book that comes with it is filled with different ideas on things that can be built, but more importantly it shows how the bricks can be put together, and can be used as a basic teaching tool.

I gave this a five, not because of the special pieces or anything like that, but because I feel it is a very good introductory set for children to learn from.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
