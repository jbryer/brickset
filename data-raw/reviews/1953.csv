"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-26T14:47:44Z","A Decent Starter Set","A couple days ago I purchased this set hoping it would be a good &quot;Starter Kit.&quot;  For the most part is has everything you need but all the peices are on the smaller end, there are lots of 2 by 3's which I've never been fond of but none of the longer pieces (longer than 2 x 4 that is) that make good wings for plans and etc.

All and all it's decent.  I should have looked on the back at the bricklisting.  Now I know and hey, it gave me an excuse to buy more.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
