There should be a yellow solid line in the middle if they want to make it two way traffic, not a white dotted. Now they should move on to freeways and avenues.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"meyerc13","2011-01-05T21:18:30.87Z","Compatible with 7280 & 7281!","<p>A little over a year ago, I was lucky enough to stumble across an out of the way toy store that had some of these road plates new in package, for the original retail price!&nbsp; My son didn't have any road plates, so at the time these were the first we purchased.&nbsp; Lucky enough, I found out that these are compatible with the latest LEGO road plates at the time of this writing, sets 7280 and 7281.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>As mentioned above, the best thing is that these are compatible with the current plates at the time of this writing.&nbsp; The road is the same width, and the studded section is the same width, so everything lines up perfectly.<br></li><li>Another great thing is that these have a green studded area, which resembles grass.&nbsp; This allows you to have more green in your City without being limited to 32 stud square green base plates.<br></li><li>The final advantage of these sets was the packaging.&nbsp; If you need straight roads, you bought a package with two straight roads.&nbsp; If you needed curves, you bought two curves.&nbsp; You didn't end up with plates you couldn't use.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The only con is that these are no longer manufactured, so they can be difficult and expensive to find.<br></li></ul>
<p>If you should happen to be as lucky as I was and stumble across these plates at a decent price, don't hesitate to buy them!<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
