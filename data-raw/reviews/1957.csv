+ dark grey road surface
- insufficient area to put buildings
- grass grows under buildings, I think the entire plate should have been dark grey.
- distributed as a pair of crossroads
- this part has less studs, and hence less plastic/usefulness than the other road plates, it should be proportionally cheaper.  But it is not, which accounts for the huge number of these plates remaining unsold in stores around the country (and seldom any of the others left, especially the more popular corners and single green baseplates).
- too many pedestrian crossings

In my opinion the crossroad should have been sold with the single green baseplate, which would have made it a lot more popular and moved them off the shelves.
