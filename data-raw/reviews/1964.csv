Some of the pieces are almost Duplo sized due to the height of the two mini figs included. Still a tub worth having in any Lego collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I want those times back. This set was very good for a five year old and a seven year old. On to the Pros and Cons! 

 Pros:
-great amount of parts
-comes with some very cool pieces
-two minifigs for two children.

 Cons:
-doors, but not enough parts to make anything more than a shed
some parts are useless.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
