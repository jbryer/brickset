She would bounce out of bed every morning before school so she could see what little set was there for the day. We would put it together and put it back in its door, we didn't combine anything until after everything was opened. The cool thing was most of the little sets came with there own instruction sheet. These are very good sets for kids 6-10 fun for them and the big kid who helps put them together - recommend them. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
