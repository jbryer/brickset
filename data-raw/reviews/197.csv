"Gus_263","2008-04-05T17:24:43.857Z","Few pieces, good design","One of the racers sets released in 2001, this set is like others of the same theme and year, basicllay a car with really few pieces, but a nice design and two or three useful pieces, a basic playability but cheap and with a feature that is make it run to &quot;crash&quot;, if a device on the front be pushed, the pilot will jump. The pilot isn't in the shape of a lego minifigure but still useful, in a car, because it not have other pieces, is a solid minifigure. The two pieces that looks like be the motor and front, making the chassis, are in some sets useful but the printed things, altough cool, are strange with other sets. The base is another piece, that isn't much useful for sets of other styles. The design is nice, the printed symbols also, but somethings makes it looks like strange if used in other sets, and the playability is limited and building is bad. Different from all the other of the same theme and year, this racer don't have a &quot;garage&quot;, that serves as a device to push it, so it is sometimes boring.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"guildfordmatt","2009-04-21T14:55:37.84Z","Simple and Useful!","This set is good because it's well ..... umm Useful!<br/>the set itself is made of 4 pieces. the chassis is faily useless as it only has eight studs and tiny litlle wheels. the figure is quite boring but may find a use.<br/>I like the ""crash"" feature, he gets thrown to one side and gets lost in some thing.<br/>I haven't found a use for the spoiler and front bit,&nbsp;but the printed bits may appeal to some.",TRUE,4,2,1,4,4
"legoandy","2010-04-19T06:51:14.123Z","Good enough. ","Most people hate this set e.g my brother legotom (his comment is below). But&nbsp;I&nbsp;think it is quite good. It may not be the best model, or very fun to build, but what counts is that it's fun to play with. The wee alien man will fly out the side of the car when it crashes. Also these guys are off an&nbsp;awesome&nbsp;game called- Lego Racers 2.<div>Even though there is still room for&nbsp;improvement, it is quite a fun set.</div><div>3/5&nbsp;<br><div><br></div></div>",TRUE,3,2,2,4,2
