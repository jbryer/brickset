This board/card game gives you all the fun of the Bionicle adventures in your own home.  The game is fast and easy to understand.  Having two or more sets allows you to search the entire island of Mata-Nui to complete your quest for all ski Kanohi masks.  Are you up to the challenge?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This pack is from two toa, Gali and Pohatu. The game is easy to understand and play, and the cards are well detailed and can be used as a basic source of info of the two toas. Informations like the powers (like water breathing from Gali and speed from Pohatu) and the masks (Kaukau and Kakama), and also basic stats (swimming, strenght, speed, and more). But the storyline isn't that important for the other bionicle sets. This isn't much useful for other lego themes, but for bionicle, and the masks can be used as armors and more in the creations. But, the masks included in the packs from 2001 are great for make collection of masks, use these in creations or in other sets, like the turaga, matoran, the original toa and the toa nuva, that have more compatibility than the new bionicle sets. This deserves a 4,5/5 in comparison with it's ideas, like be a good game to play with, be useful for bionicle, and make a story for the sets. Could be better if included something like heads or eyes for bionicle, but still.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
