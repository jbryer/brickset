This includes cards and also two masks,one from each other, with the same shape and colors of the original sets released in canisters. The cards shows info and powers from the character and the mask. Basically, six stats, like swim, speed, strength, and more. Is easy to understand and play the game, and these cards are too useful for the storyline of bionicle (this isn't important, but something is cool on this). The set don't have the idea to be useful for the lego sets, but the masks can help for a mask collection or for who don't have the original toa, but the nuva. The set in overall is a 4,5/5 if compared as a trading card game from bionicle.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
