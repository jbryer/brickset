This have two different masks, and some cards about two toa, Onua and Lewa. Released in the first year of bionicle (2001), this helped the sales as source of information, as fun and more for the main bionicle released (six packaged in canisters). More than a game, the cards can show some basic information about the abbilities, powers and stats of the characters (in this set, from Onua and Lewa), some like speed, strenght, swim and more. The masks are different in shape and color, and it was made differently in comparison with the new masks. The masks are also useful to a collection of masks, and are recommended to turaga, matoran and to the original toa or toa nuva. This game don't have much things to be useful for other lego, but still good with it's ideas, be a cool trading card game and help who want more about the first bionicle. This deserves a 4,5/5 in these ideas.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
