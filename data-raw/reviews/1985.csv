Like all the other Lego buckets, this set includes lots of pieces (this have exactly 400 pieces) and you can make any building with the pieces. And also, all the pieces can be useful to increase any set or creation (though several of the pieces are bricks with different colors, that are rare in sets from Mars 
Mission, Agents and Castle themes due to their main colors). Here are the contents:

If you search for the pictures of the pieces, visit the inventory at peeron.
The different colors of the pieces can makes this set more useful, so, if you want to get more 400 pieces, this set can be a good choice to you. At Briclink you can find only one being sold complete, by $17,50. I think it worth the money, because it is a good bucket (in terms of utility, number of pieces and of course, quality) though have only two minifigures, have lots of other pieces, making a great playability. 

About the bucket, it is really well designed, though basic. It is blue, have one big illustrated sticker in each side, each shows different models, and one shows the pieces included. It have a green handle and a red lid with the shape of a big 4X4 brick with the Lego logo in each big studs. And also, inside it includes not only the pieces, but a paper showing more models and the other products of the Freestyle theme.   

Recently I saw at a sticker in a side of the bucket, that was wrote: &quot;Produzido na Zona Franca de Manaus&quot; (in english it means: produced in Zona Franca de Manaus, that is a region here in Brazil). At the 90's years, Lego produced some sets in Brazil, but currently the Lego company don't products more, unfortunately to much of the Lego fans here. But I think it is because the Lego company don't saw much profit in those years. Currently, some sets (not special editions) are distributed by an enterprise, and it makes the prices higher, due to the taxes of imports.And also, I know that I made a review of this set before, but I am making this new, more complete than the previous, to you know a bit more about the set.

Returning to what really matter (the set):
Overall, this set don't have a right building, as a bucket of 400 pieces you can use the pieces to make any creation or to increase your sets. But you have to know that some color schemes like the white and brown are old, being a bit different from now. I reccomend this to who searches for more pieces, this is really a good choice. 5 out of 5 without doubt.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
