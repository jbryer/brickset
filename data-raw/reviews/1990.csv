Set is almost Duplo in nature very few pieces and easy to build. I do like the ladder on the firetruck and the mini figure(Mickey is about 2&quot; tall). Fun set glad I own it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Alemas","2009-05-19T17:35:29.013Z","I was surprised when I found this...","I never knew I had this. It came as a shock that I had something like this! Anyway, this set is for little kids, the wheels have a metal axle and doesn't go on smooth surfaces, Mickey is strange, and the door is... hang on, it's a WINDOW! It looks like a door! At least it has rare pieces: well, almost everything is rare!

Pros:

Rare pieces
Ladder
Trans-blue 2x2 round brick

Cons:

Metal axle
Can't go on smooth surfaces
Strange Mickey
Window that looks like a door
Strange design

Overall, it's not a great set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"modena","2011-01-04T11:40:05.623Z","Look at those parts!","<p>I got this set when I was very little. I never really got to build it, but I still have the parts!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Great parts!</li><li>Rotating ladder!</li><li>Cute little replica of Mickey!</li><li>Contains a simple-to-use fire pump (on the truck)!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Mickeys legs are stuck together</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>This set wasn't totally bad. I don't remember the main model, but the parts were great. I really got the most out of the rotating white brick. The ladder holder did break, but it still fits in. The set gives you this neat transparent blue element, which is great for an ambulance. You also get a printed car front, and a window.</p><p>The only con is that Mickey's legs are all in one chunk, so that you can't move him so easily.</p><p>Overall, this set wasn't that bad, and if you don't build it, you will find use of the parts!</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,1,2
