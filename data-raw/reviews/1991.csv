I'm giving it a 4 because it is a really good set for it's target audience but not so much for everyone else. The Mickey and Minnie figures look (it pains me to type it) charming.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Unqualified_AT_AT_Driver","2010-01-25T00:46:21.467Z","Some Good Pieces","I remember getting this set when I was really young. I still actually have about  half of the pieces from it. Some of the pieces in this set are very useful and I still use some. For that I give it 4.

Pros:
Cool pieces (Archway, Umbrella, Gate, Roof Pieces)

Cons:
None really, especially if you like Mickey Mouse and all things Mickey

Get it if you like Mickey or want the pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
