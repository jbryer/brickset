It has four train wheels instead of two as Blue Hopper Car 4536. The colour scheme is really excellent: tan, blue, and black. In my opinion, this waggon looks better than 4536. The colours are more appealing. 

On one end of the waggon you can see some black ladders leading up to the top. Next to the ladders, there is a shovel held by a clip. This clip is part of a 1x2 brick, which might have been something new at the time of release. When I assembled it, I was quite surprised to find a 1x2 brick with a clip. I was only used to seeing 1x1 plates with clip. 

The other side of the waggon looks identical: ladders and a clip. But the clip holds a brush. In the picture you can see two doors to unload the freight. There are also two doors on the other side. Several dark grey 1x1 bricks are used as freight. The dark grey pieces in this set are all old dark grey, but I am not sure if this set was also produced with bley. Anyway, there are only few grey pieces in it. And I like the tiles on the waggons top. A feature it shares with Blue Hopper Car 4536. 

Finally, I'd like to suggest using it with 4536 and/or the crocodile engine 4551. Three or four 10017s will definitely look great when added to the crocodile engine. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
