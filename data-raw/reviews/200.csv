Simple set with a low piece count but for the money a good deal. The boat is out of scale for most of the other Fire Department, yet it is still worth picking up if you can find it. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set has go some of my favourite LEGO pieces in it like the walkie talkie and the PFD. I also like the blue pieces and this et goes good with LEGO city sets. The guy""s head is also cool.
