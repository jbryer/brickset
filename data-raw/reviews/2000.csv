They are Jack Stone Style. If this set had REAL minifigs, I would rate it 4 for awsome pieces. Those great parts dont deserve to be packaged with........(shudders)...Jack Stone.........Sorry I just hate Jack Stone, 4+, anything junior, and 4+ and Jack Stone just puts a scar in legos awsome history, and I hate it for that. Good thing I gave away the figs. Now, anyway, This still would be a great set if they would get rid of those darn 4+ figs!",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
