I like the medic and the three wheeler is cool-period. One stays at home in my LEGO collection and the other sits on my desk at the Insurance office. When kids come in with their parents they like to play with it, some of our monthly customers kid's call me legoman(its funny). I also have a few of the extra older LEGO catalogs in my desk to keep them busy while the adults take care of business. This little set is special to me for the reasons I just mentioned.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

However, you also get a minifig and some supplies and that is pretty much it. This is great for the fan that never owned a trike, but that's pretty much it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set has cool pieces like the black suitcase and the bike. This set is fun to play with. The only bad thing is the suitcase is easy to lose!",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Adventurers","2012-07-22T18:29:51.89Z","An awesome set","I still remember the day I got this set, Christmas 2001, along with the shell car wash set and some other small shell sets. Boy, was I thrilled. But enough about me, lets talk about the set itself. Although small, it has great potential and will look cool in just about any town layout. The only problem I see with this set is that...well it's......I can't think of any cons! Great minifig, great accessories, and awesome concept, you get gas, and your kids get a dirt cheap toy for less than a candy bar! Seriously, at $1.70, this set is well worth the price no matter who you are. If you can find it for less than $5.00, buy it!<br>",TRUE,5,4,2,3,5
