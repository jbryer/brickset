"AddictedToStyrene","2007-12-31T10:07:47.7Z","Simple Shell Set","This is another Shell promotion set, available in their petrol stations in Australia in 1999. It is a very simple set, a lot like a Classic Space buggy or Town Go-karts. I like that it is an easy build and fits into the very small scale and price range of the Shell promotions set. I don't like that it is over simplified. It is supposed to be a dragster but it looks more like a soap box racer. One good point is that the mini-fig has a Shell logo on his shirt, so if you are building a service station or a Formula One team, he can be an authentic looking Shell employee. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
