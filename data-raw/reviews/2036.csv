"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-15T11:39:29Z","Very clever product from Lego","While visiting a Lego Outlet store in Washington DC during BrickFest 2004, I came across this unique piece at a great price.  I must admit I have a love for all Lego products that include Johnny Thunder, so this was no exception.  The Lego frame is made from a tan base plate and is very sturdy.  The frame has a clear sheet of plastic to place over the photo but it does make for a tight fit.  

So if you have a Lego fanatic in your household and you want to help them remember who you are, then take a picture of yourself, put it in this frame and give it to them for Christmas.  They will truly love you for the thoughtful gift.

On a side note, I've added many other minifigs to this frame to proudly display the cast of my Lego stop motion film, &quot;Alabama Jones and the Lost Topping of Doom&quot;.  Please be sure to visit our web site...
