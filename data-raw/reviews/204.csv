"Matn","2007-09-01T05:58:34.003Z","Tank'em up?","Okay, so, I got this set on christmas morning. I was about six years old and I thought is was awesome. I didn't have much trucks and this one was so great. The main look of the tanker is nice, it's compact and it has a nice design with the Shell colors and logo's. The only thing I (now) don't like about the Shell Tanker is, it's too small for a Tanker. Overall it's a nice set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-14T14:37:38.03Z","Great Tanker","This is a really good set from Shell released in 1999. I really like the idea of a Shell tanker because I own a Shell station which is perfect. The minifig is great but they're also rare, but at least I have four of them. The trailer is OK, but at least this set is good. 5 out of 5 for an amazing add-on.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"biggin44","2008-12-07T15:46:51.56Z","Loved it","I got two of these and love them both. I actually made on in to a tanker truck without the trailer and it was fun to build. I was easy to build but I was not looking for something that was hard. It looks good and thats all that matters to me",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"devilhead","2010-02-16T23:36:56.123Z","Neat little tanker","<p>This set depicts&nbsp; a small tanker truck.&nbsp; It may be&nbsp;too small for a long haul truck, but it is ideal as a support vehicle at an airport or race track.&nbsp;The design incorporates the Shell logo and color scheme.&nbsp; The detailing is smartly done.&nbsp; Overall, a very nice set.</p>

"sf1378","2011-06-08T12:59:24.923Z","yay!","<div><br></div><div>Finally nabbed this set off ebay, from a German Lady no less years after its release! Its a nice update of the classic Shell Tankers Legoland Town had, it did cost me about Â£19.00 but its something I've hankered for on and off over the years as I really like Lego Tankers, expecially ones with the rarer Shell branding.</div><div><br></div><div>Its nice to build, classic in styling to the much older sets but has innovative bits on it that signal the changes in Lego that were happening and its not Lego Juniorised rubbish.</div><div><br></div><div>I really like the ball joint hitching as you can have the unit on edges of sofa seats and the like in interesting positions. Its like a suspension system...The figures nice too, classicish face which I always prefer really.</div><div><br></div><div>I could imagine this tanker truck coming to refuel the Shell Stop n Shop's pumps which I've always thought of as the classic Shell pumps that came with the pigtailed haired Lego Girl, its a perfect size for it, set 6610.</div><div><br></div><div>My only gripe is that perhaps the trailer should have been the same length of the Exxon and Shell trailers to sets: 6695/96.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,1,5,5,5,1
