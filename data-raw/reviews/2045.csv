It has a lot of bricks(I made a pyramid with the yellow ones) and all sorts of bricks with printed faces! It has (I believe)rare pieces such as an elephant head, camel head, and a dog head. It also has some doors, windows, and thick baseplates!

Pros:
- Lots of variety
- Bricks
- Rare head pieces
- Doors
- Windows

Cons:
- None!

Overall, a great Basic set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
