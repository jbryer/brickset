It contains many standard bricks and plates in different colours, but you also get slopes, inverted slopes, and special parts like steering wheels, car doors, windscreens, and tyres. So if you are running out of bricks, check the brick inventory on peeron.com! Maybe you'll find many of the bricks you need in this set. 

I can also recommend it for children, because this set has everything you need to build various things. You can build small houses as well as cars. You get tools with which you can repair vehicles and there are also two minifigs.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-18T10:08:13.723Z","LEGO Basic - Basic Box 5+ Review","This set is a really great set to have and you can also build 7 different models with this set. But you can't build them all at once. We also get two minifigs in this model and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. This set is also great for pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own creations). It's a fun build but I would recommend you to buy the other sets you want more first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
