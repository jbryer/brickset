But compared to other 1999-sets it's not that juniorized. The cockpit is a bit futuristic with that ugly canopy piece. On the back of the cab is a little cargo hold with a simulated oil can, but no room for the helmet and there's also a tool hold on both sides of the cab. The whole set misses doors. The Racecar is an Ferarri F1 attempt in classic lego town style and is transported by the truck. The minifig is classic mid to late 90s style with an rather plain torso.
It deserves an solid 8/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I feel that most of these sets were priced a bit higher due to the fact that they are a real company.&nbsp; The truck itself is a great idea, but another view hit it spot on saying the bed was too short. The only vehicle that fits on it is that small race car. </p>

<p>The design is out dated with the new lego line for city. The cab doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I don't recall seeing too many trucks like that. Sorry for the negativity. This was just my least favorite in the Shell Promotionals. </p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,4
