If you don't need them, don't buy it. But I believe it is always good to have some standard bricks. I always need them. Standard bricks are also excellent for younger children who are not yet able to build detailed houses and castles. Especially young children do not care if they have a red and yellow castle. When I was a child, my castles were made with lots of different colours. I didn't have enough black and gray bricks, but I didn't care much about it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
