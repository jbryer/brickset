<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Very cool tires and they are useful for MOCS</li><li>The ramp is good for any racers car</li><li>The barracades are useful</li><li>good for stop-motion animations</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Hard to find</li><li>It would be nice to get maybe an exclusive tiny turbo</li><li>The monster tires require bigger wheels which are kinda rare</li><li><br></li><li><br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a great set and I would highly recommend dit to a racers fan. &nbsp;However it is kinda rare. &nbsp;I rate this set a 4.8.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
