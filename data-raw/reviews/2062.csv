"backdraft","2018-09-18T10:11:39.35Z","Small, kind starter set","<p>I bought this set on an online auction. It was unopened. I think it&#39;s almost incredible for a nearly 20-year-old LEGO set.<br />
I found useful items and a nice but simple mini-figure in the box. There are a large and two smaller bags for the pieces and a minifigure. The small green motherboard and the guide are not wrapped up.<br />
I think it is a perfect starter set.</p>

<p>My rating of 4/5</p>
