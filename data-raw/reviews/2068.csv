My first review of this year, i think...","great set and i must agree with all of the other reviews, this set is great considering you get the nesquik rabbit and it is a great to go along with the theme Racers. This set is not very old school but.....i think this set really deserves this 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
