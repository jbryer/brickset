"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-05T19:10:41.263Z","Not the best","This car wash includes car, tire pump, two monifigs and useful pieces. I had fun running the car through the wash and having adventures with it. A major problem was that it can only fit small, short cars. Also, sometimes the pipes would malfunction and not spring back into place. The set eventually became boring. I put it into storage and took the windows and car, although the car is now abandoned, replaced by nicer ones. I don't recommend this if you get bored with sets after a while. Pricewise, the set is okay. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sparticusjoe","2017-11-14T06:43:23.707Z","If you can look past the stickers, this is a superb set that fits well in any town.","<p>Stickers. Most Lego fans hate them. I&#39;m sure some love them, but I&#39;ve yet to meet anyone like that. I don&#39;t like them one bit. Most Lego sets I enjoy collecting, displaying, and taking apart and putting back together are older Town sets before stickers were as widespread as they&#39;ve gotten in the 2000&#39;s. Town Jr. was indeed some dark times for TLC, but man did 90&#39;s kids never have to worry about stickers with just a handful of exceptions, so many printed pieces from that era. The Shell promo sets are those exceptions. Sadly, due to the sets&#39; ages, fast approaching 20 years here soon, it&#39;s extremely difficult to find older sets with good condition stickers. The one I dug out of a storage bin recently that I had as a kid certainly doesn&#39;t. I hadn&#39;t been playing with or indeed doing anything with this set for almost 20 years, and just time (probably mixed with the rather extreme heat of the desert I live in) managed to peel the stickers to a depressing degree. All parts that are printed, however, still stand strong and look great.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure you already know that, because as I stated before, I&#39;ve yet to actually meet a Lego enthusiast that actually *likes* the blasted things. This set is one of the few I&#39;ll be reviewing from my attic finds that actually has stickers and so I figured I&#39;d get that off my chest first. Now onto my review.</p>

<p><strong>The Car Wash: </strong>If you&#39;ve read any number of my reviews before, you&#39;ll know how odd I find it that virtually no 90&#39;s era Town sets feature vehicle roofs with just a small handful of exceptions. This set actually comes so close to being an exception, considering the included car DOES in fact have a roof. Alas, the car wash.. does not. I&#39;ve never seen a roofless car wash before, which does not mean they don&#39;t exist, just that I&#39;ve never seen one and the concept seems laughably prone to failure (better hope it doesn&#39;t rain!). The car wash also has stickers on it that don&#39;t age well in the western Texan heat, to say the least. Those two things are literally the only downsides I can find for this model.</p>

<p>Other than those two minor niggles... This car wash looks absolutely perfect. The rollers actually spin, the hose bricks on the top of the set serve the function of adding to the realism *and* applying tension on the rollers, making them actually behave like a car wash when you drive the included car through it. The control panel on the outside (are car washes controlled from the outside? I know nothing about this topic) looks super sharp and the included brush and bucket pieces look great for those minifigures with cars they&#39;d rather hand wash. The tile bricks being used as &quot;tracks&quot; for the car to go through the car wash are fantastic details, too. This is an absolutely brilliant model of a car wash, and an easy contender with the Bank and Shell Select Shop as the best buildings Lego produced in the late 90&#39;s.</p>

<p><strong>The Car: </strong>You know, at first I thought this little vehicle looked sort of odd, but it&#39;s grown on me. It&#39;s got a nice 80&#39;s aesthetic to it that works pretty well and compliments the car wash nicely. You don&#39;t have a pre-made printed grill for once, I&#39;ve always loved how the smooth car tires of old look (as opposed to the larger, &quot;grooved&quot; ones), and the sunroof actually opening and behaving like a sunroof is a welcome touch. The car fits in the car wash, which is of course the purpose of its existence and inclusion on this set, and is just the right dimensions for that job. The thing looks pretty snappy driving around on your Lego town&#39;s streets, too.</p>

<p>Also, look at that: doors and a roof. On a vehicle. In a 90&#39;s Town Lego set. Soak it in, folks, because it sadly wasn&#39;t the norm at the time. This neat little car makes you go &quot;so Lego knew how to do it, why *didn&#39;t* they do it on the other Town sets?&quot; and I don&#39;t have an answer to that one. I wish more Lego cars of the era had this many pieces, this much realism, and looked this attractive.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>This thing comes together fascinatingly. Watching the car wash slowly take form is a delight to do, and this is one of the few sets from the era that actually has a building experience of any note to talk about. The pipes-as-tension assembly on the car wash is pretty genius, and the whole building comes together extremely nicely in the end. I enjoy how when you&#39;re building it it&#39;s not super clear what purpose some pieces (such as the smooth tiles, the numerous supports, etc) actually serve in the overall set until you&#39;re several steps down the line. I really enjoyed building this one, and have done so several times.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>I&#39;m giving this a three, the lowest ranking I&#39;ll be handing out in this review. Why, you ask? Well, apart from just a handful of bricks that are more &quot;uncommon&quot; than &quot;rare&quot; or &quot;exclusive&quot;, there really aren&#39;t many bricks included in this set that are &quot;gotta have it&quot; type pieces. Most of the bricks are very basic, and the set doesn&#39;t include any of the shell details (bar the minifig&#39;s shirt) printed at all, they&#39;re all stickers. It would have been fantastic to get some nice Shell printed pieces, but alas, you don&#39;t. On the plus side, this means that there are probably a good amount of people out there that could build this thing with just loose stray bricks they have laying around.</p>

<p>The obvious standout exceptions are the washer rollers, though those can be had elsewhere (such as street sweeper models), though they are very hard to find in the quantity needed for this set (nine total), the sunroof is relatively rare, and the car wash roller-holder assembly only has a small handful of other sets it appears in. The shell employee is obviously only in Shell sets and the brush is hard to find outside of Paradisa and the like.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Why so high, you ask? Well, admittedly a car wash isn&#39;t exactly the most fascinating thing in the world for most youngsters. However, having a relatively realistic feeling and looking Lego town was pretty fascinating for me when I was a youngster and this thing works extremely well in that regard. Even my tiny rural area has a car wash, so things like this are everywhere. If you are, as I was, interested in modeling and adding things you see every day (as a kid I saw a lot of sedans and pickup trucks... not so much a lot of spaceports), this set does a great job of that. Makes your town feel more authentic to have the basics like a bank, a car wash, or a store in it, rather than just sixty thousand police stations.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>It&#39;s not that it&#39;s a bad value considering how cool this set is, more just that it&#39;s hard to find for a good price. This set doesn&#39;t appear to have been released for long and most places to get it are overseas, not surprisingly in the Netherlands in particular (those guys get all the good sets!), and also not surprisingly on Bricklink. It&#39;s rarely on ebay and when it is it&#39;s at scalper prices, as is ebay&#39;s custom, so Bricklink&#39;s your way to go. It&#39;s not a common set and can be had for the mid to high 20&#39;s of dollars, and is well worth that. Sadly when you factor in overseas shipping it winds up being in the 30&#39;s of dollars and that can be a somewhat harder pill to swallow for an 18 year old Lego set of a relatively mundane building that doesn&#39;t have *that* many pieces to begin with. New and like new ones get even more expensive from there so you&#39;re gonna fork over some money to come across this bad boy.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really into realism and modeling slice of life scenes, you&#39;ll want this set. If you&#39;re a kid that finds building miniature models of the mundane as interesting as I did (you won&#39;t see me reviewing a lot of Harry Potter sets...), you&#39;ll want this set. If you just think the idea of a licensed branded car wash set from 18 years ago is an interesting enough oddity to be worth importing (and believe me, I don&#39;t blame you), you&#39;ll want this set. Don&#39;t pay an arm and a leg for it... though between you and me, if you do, I won&#39;t blame you. It&#39;s that cool.</p>
