<p>That's not good, but the set isn't so bad... At the backside of the polybag you see there is a girl head too, but that&nbsp;&nbsp;doesn't make sense! there is another head in it but that's not the same. </p>

<p>Conclusion, If you aren't&nbsp;me I think you are going to like this set, (don't pay money for it!)</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,5,1
"WoutStopmotion","2012-08-05T01:22:39.17Z","A review (of some kind)","I seemed to have this set, and while i was browsing Brickset i found out i had it!<br><br>So... here's a review of it. My first review BTW. I'm gonna explain every part of the rating.<br><br><b>Building Expirience<br><br></b>The car is basic as you can see from the picture. It is quite easy to build, and i maybe could even build it from the picture if i knew where the pieces were. I haven't had any experience with it as i can't remember that. In 2003 i was four or something...<br><br><b>Parts<br><br></b>I really love the parts! The pull-back motor seems like an unique brick and the head-kart driver brick looks neat too. As i love classic-looking faces i love this face. Before i knew it was this set, i almost thought it was an Alpha Team face...<br><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>Well... this only means racing. And sticking other heads into the kart brick. But the pull-back motor is a nice feature and also is great for playing. You could use it for different creations aswell, or mod the car itself.<br><br><b>Value for Money</b><br><br>In the C1000's fashion you probably had to buy 10 euros of stuff. And 10 euros is a bit too much for a polybag set with just about 24 pieces...<br><br><h4><b>Overall Rating</b></h4><p><br></p><p>This small set has overall nice pieces which make up for the basic design Lego made.</p><p>I'd recommend it for a cool face and not for the lack of playability and design.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,2
