It's not a terrible deal, especially with all the stylized curved slopes and such that you get. There was also a blue one, which I like a little better. Actually, I would love to see more of these polybagged mini-sets. It seems TLG is heading away from them. No more holiday minis, and the Creator minis are really just an attempt to liquidate all those extra Mr. Magorium's Big Books, I think.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

i found this at WALMART in AMERICA, brickset, so no i didnt go to the netherlands and happen to be buying bread and pick this up.... might want to fix that?

anyway, this was a decent set and had a nice design. pretty sturdy and didnt have stickers, i dont think. only problem was that there was no figure.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
