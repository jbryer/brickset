"Gus_263","2008-06-20T13:24:15.043Z","A promotional small car","This set is a promotional, and this was released in the Netherlands, in the year of 2004. This car is small and so much basic, at the first view looks like just a small car, but it isn't bad.

The building shows some likeness with the einy turbos, like in the two sides, with the blue pieces to increase the chassis and show the &quot;flashlights&quot; (these are a part of the blue piece, unlike many other bigger car sets, these flashlights don't shows a different color). The building is really basic (of course because it is a promotional, the promotional sets are ever small and basic), and very similar to the new tiny turbos, but this car looks like more simple.

The small yellow plates of the front are good to increase it with a good color scheme at all, and some other small gray and yellow plates connect the wheels part. Each wheel have blue color on the center , altough the wheels of the back are a bit more big, and the four wheels have different but useful black tires. Increasing it more, this set have blue pieces above the back of the chassis and the top of the chassis is a black piece with printed details, no much realistic in design, but still good.

Overall, this set is good and useful for a promotional, the pieces are very common among the Tiny turbos subtheme. But this cannot be bought by a price of a Tiny turbo, because it don't include that unnecessary garage. If you find it  bit cheaper, or even in the same price of a impulse, maybe it will be good to increase tiny turbos, but it don't worth the money very well, it was a promo. So, it gets a 4,6 of 5 by useful pieces and capacibility to increase any other sets from the racers or even from another themes.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It's hard to give it a 5 because it's so tiny, but I paid only a dollar for it, so it's well worth it. These little polybag sets are great; I wish LEGO would put more of them on the market.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
