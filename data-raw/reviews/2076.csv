It's identical to the Green Xpod, except for the missing combined Model instructions. I really like the fact, that you can do really much with those small sets. If you just add a Minifig you can even build hoverbikes or other small minifig-sized creations.

I gavie it a 9 because at the end of the instructions, there were no instructions to combime it with other sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Full of interesting pieces and the colors are good. I suggest you go out and get this.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The black ones look awesome with the new x-pods. If you would want more reviews look at the green x pod. they are the same set, different colors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-16T21:03:02Z","Very cool","I like these x-pods, I find them fun to build with, and they all have a great assortment of pieces in them. I especially like this one. Yes, it is the same as the green pod, but I thinks it's a lot better, because robots are black, not green. I've had this fora while now, and just today, I was bored, so I decided to build with it. The end result was an awesome robot that uses all of the pieces (except for the pod). Worth the $3.50 that you pay for it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-02T14:03:46.547Z","Nice building for small robot sets ","This set is one of the small sets released with their pods, in 2004. The Black Robot pod have some small pieces that are few, but much useful. Also including the pod, this set is more to create mini robots or use their pieces to increase other sets. The small robots are easy to build and the playability, like the size, is basic, like more the playabilty of a minifigure, good to play with. In comparison with some other small sets of robots and pods, this change no much except for few pieces and of course, building and colors. With a basic building and good playability for the size, this set still a nice small set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Quirrelthesquirrel","2009-12-20T22:37:04.357Z","Ooh! Scary!","<p>I bought this set the other day and its great. It is very similar to the <em>4346 Robo Pod</em>, but I like the colours on this one better. It was also only released for Halloween for a short amount of time in 2003. </p>
<p>You can build a shooting robot with a blaster and posable limbs, a storage robot&nbsp;with posable eye stalks and the sets container for its body (Can store spare pieces), or a flying robot with weapons and posable head. </p>
<p>Compared to later X-Pod's, it's a bit basic, but you get alot of fun out of it. The movable components make it even more enjoyable when combined with <em>4346 Robo Pod</em>, or even combining it with <em>4347</em>, <em>4348</em>, <em>4349</em> makes a lot of creating fun!</p>
