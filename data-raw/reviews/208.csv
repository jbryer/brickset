"sparticusjoe","2018-07-09T17:59:27.567Z","The most mediocre of the 90's Shell sets.","<p>First thing&#39;s first: This set is not nearly as amazing as the Shell Car Wash or the Shell Convenience store sets, which in my book are two of the finest Lego sets I own and by far the coolest &quot;advertisement&quot;-style Lego sets. Those two work fantastic as just an addition to your Lego City in addition to being advertisements. However, this set is still just fine. It&#39;s right smack dab in the middle of the late nineties shell/Lego collaboration sets. Third out of five isn&#39;t too shabby when two of them are all-time classics.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say this set isn&#39;t a great addition to your Lego City; it is. It&#39;s just not nearly as realistic or feature-packed as its two brethren in the Shell/Lego lineup of 1999. There are a few reasons for this I&#39;ll get into, so onto the portion where I review the individual parts:</p>

<p><strong>THE FERRARI:</strong> That&#39;s right boys and girls, this set is not one but TWO advertisements in one, and I gotta say, it works well. A Ferrari visiting a gas station makes perfect sense in addition to being product placement. It doesn&#39;t feel gratuitous at all. In addition to getting some extra advertising dollars for TLC, it&#39;s... A pretty well designed little car, actually. Worlds better than the late nineties Town Jr. &quot;a printed grill, a rollbar, and a premade chassis&quot; pieces of crap that TLC was pumping out in other sets of this time period. This car actually looks like it should, it has doors that open and close, a cool brick-built headlight system, and my favorite, a pair of translucent neon red grills on the back of it. Cool car. I could do without the Ferrari sticker on the front slope brick, but alas, it&#39;s an adver-set, so they&#39;re probably not gonna put that much effort into printing a brick exclusive for just it. The driver minifig is pretty cool too. Got that classic brown bomber jacket with sunglasses and a sensible haircut look to him. Undoubtedly a man of wealth and taste to own such a car.</p>

<p><strong>THE TRICYCLE: </strong>That&#39;s right folks, it&#39;s 1999, so by law TLC had to include a tricycle in every city-related Lego set they possibly could. This one is exactly as underwhelming as the doubtless small army of the things you&#39;ve amassed if you collect sets from this era. It&#39;s your standard pre-built chassis, yellow/red light bricks, and has a little rollbar on the back for some reason and a curved brick that&#39;s probably supposed to be an exhaust pipe but doubles as a place to put your Shell employee&#39;s helmet while he&#39;s hard at work manning the pumps. Not much to say about this, it&#39;s still a piece nobody wants and everybody wishes were just the cool two-wheeled motorcycle. Sort of of note, the shell employee character that comes with it is depicted as the driver of the trike. The trike is also in shell colors. Is this supposed to be a Shell corporate motorcycle? Does such a thing exist? You&#39;d think the set would include an extra character to drive this but nope, the shell employee does. Doesn&#39;t even come with an alternate &quot;work&quot; piece of headgear, the dude just drives the motor-trike. Huh.</p>

<p><strong>THE FILLING STATION:</strong> Look, it&#39;s not that it&#39;s *bad*. It isn&#39;t bad. It&#39;s just that it&#39;s considerably lower effort than the other two buildings in this lineup. First we have the problem of stickers. It&#39;s lousy with them, including the mother of all sticker-over-assemblies in the &quot;SELECT&quot; sign. The sign looks great... when the stickers are new. 19 years of having the stickers together has not been kind to the ones on my set and doubtlessly any you can easily come across as well, so the stickers over assemblies look pretty poor due to the age. This is a big reason I don&#39;t like stickers on Lego sets at all, they age remarkably poorly compared to their decaled counterparts. But again, it&#39;s an advertisement set, so temper your expectations a bit I suppose. Still, there are at least thirteen stickers on this set that I can see at a quick glance at it, so just be aware of that. After this much time since it&#39;s release, you&#39;re probably better off just not putting them on. On a side note, does &quot;Shell Select&quot; even exist anymore? I don&#39;t recognize almost any of the symbols on that sign, a white and green triangle, a pair of green circles on a yellow background, and a yellow slash through a red background. I&#39;ve never seen those (nor a shell select station), though I also live in the USA in a considerably remote and isolated part of the country so it could just be me being a culture less hillbilly, who knows.</p>

<p>Other than the stickers, the biggest problem with this set is the scale. It&#39;s remarkably out of scale. TLC sold fire stations that were multiple stories tall that were smaller than this set is tall. This bad boy is absolutely huge and it looks really weird next to other sets as a result. The canopy is a whopping sixteen studs by twelve studs wide and long respectively, which makes the thing just look enormous. It dwarfs the convenience store and car wash which it really probably shouldn&#39;t do all things considered.</p>

<p>My other relatively minor complaint about the structure is the use of space. The left side baseplate is very well used, there&#39;s a pair of filling nozzles so your separately bought Shell Oil Tanker set can fill the gas pumps underground up, there are a pair of direction arrows to direct traffic to and from the filling station, and there&#39;s the massive sign featuring gas prices that are astronomical if they&#39;re in USD which they&#39;re undoubtedly not. The right side baseplate has three flower bricks on it and that&#39;s it. Nothing else. Just three flowers. I can&#39;t help but feel that more could be done with all the empty space there.</p>

<p>The pumps themselves look awesome, though. Both have hoses (with different colors, a nice touch! I imagined the black one is gasoline and the green one is diesel), a red shutoff button, and computer consoles to pay for your gas in. The bucket with the scrub brush in the middle is a great touch, as at least out here in Western Texas every gas station has a little place to scrub the dust and dirt off of your truck at and I&#39;m a sucker for seeing things I see in real life in Lego form. On the right side of the pumps is a fire extinguisher and a broom, which is sort of out of place. I&#39;ve at least never seen a gas station with a broom before, but the fire extinguisher&#39;s really cool!</p>

<p><strong>BUILDING EXPERIENCE:</strong> It&#39;s okay. Not great as it should be mainly due to half the set being blank space, the obscene amount of stickers, and the kind of poor re-enforcement of the station&#39;s construction. The massive 16x12 canopy is held in place by a pair of 2x2 bricks that just don&#39;t hold it in at all, making it more delicate than it has any reason to be.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY:</strong> I&#39;m a crabby old man that doesn&#39;t play with sets, but when I was a kid and wasn&#39;t I had a great time with this one. I&#39;m also a sucker for mundane everyday things modeled in Lego form and sure enough, this is a close approximation of a gas station so I loved it. Far as Displayability goes, it&#39;s okay. The weird scale issues makes it not as good as it should be, but it makes a nice little diorama along with four of the five other Shell sets (the car transporter one really doesn&#39;t fit in with the theme very well at all, sadly).</p>

<p><strong>PARTS: </strong>Not great as it should be. The huge reliance on stickers makes it this way. No printed parts whatsoever means no real exclusives at all. You get some nice canopy bricks that help with MOC-ing buildings with sunroofs, you get a nice assortment of flower bricks, and you get plenty of red, white, and yellow generic bricks but there isn&#39;t anything here you don&#39;t already probably have fifty of already. The rarest pieces in this set are probably the two baseplates, and you can absolutely never have enough baseplates so it&#39;s good for that.</p>

<p><strong>VALUE:</strong> Well, it&#39;s a long out of print 1999 era Town set, which is to say if you want it you&#39;re importing it from the Netherlands or elsewhere abroad. It&#39;s not particularly cheap even for that anyways, running around 50-ish dollars usually which to be 100 percent honest it isn&#39;t worth. The set&#39;s cool and all and if you&#39;re a completionist it&#39;s probably the hardest of the five sets in its &quot;theme&quot; to find, but it&#39;s not fifty bucks worth of good, especially considering the stickers extremely poor aging. You get all the fun of customs fees, extremely long shipping time, etc. with importing a set like this, and if you&#39;re going to do that to any of these old sets do it for the car wash and convenience store sets, those ones truly could not be more worth it. This one&#39;s just kind of there.</p>
