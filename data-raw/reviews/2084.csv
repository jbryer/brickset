"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-26T18:55:38Z","Good without instructions...","A robot lover would see the cover and think &quot;wow.&quot; My first impression was &quot;eww...&quot; but I still ordered it, nonetheless. I built that robot on the cover, and it wasn't that nice. The other stumpy robot isn't that well put-together, either. But I give so much praise to this set because it has a great color scheme and makes excellent micro mechs. Don't be fooled by the hip-less robot on the cover... this set is good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-21T15:06:03Z","Not as good as the black one.","The black duplacate of these was better. It is still nice. I don't know why you would give any X-pod anything less than a 9, though. LEGO, you did a great job at this. X-pods are one of the best lines yet. 

BEST LEGO LINES:

1. Alpha Team
2. LEGO Studios
3. LEGO Island Extreme Stunts
4. City
5. Designer sets
6. X-pods
7. World City
8. Trains

NOTE: you might see wolrd city is 2nd to last, well, If it changes so that more city buildings are in it, it will be better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-01T05:08:25Z","Worth the money...","I first saw this set when browsing lego.com. I saw the four x-pods, and saw that the green one had robots. Me, being a robot lover, immediately wanted it. I soon got the set, and think that it's nicely designed. While the robots look strange, that's only cuz' most people compare them to larger legobot sets. For the bots size, the designs are nicely done. Try going to x-podworld.com, and i'll try to post a good design, under the name July.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-06T12:41:18Z","Robots, best thing since nuts and bolts.","When I laied eyes on the x-pods, they were like the 8th wonder of the world, especially the Robot one. Many a time have I taken this set on trips. This set brings hours of fun when you aren't using the x-pod play-off cards to build by or the instructions. I am a big fan of this set, because it's compact, has lots of neat pieces, and a cool color scheme. This would make a great stocking stuffer. IMO, I give it a nine, for everything above.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-08T22:55:40Z","Super cool robots!","All I can say is &quot;wow&quot;. Lego has done a great job on these X-pods. They are compact and you can take them on road trips. You can have a lot of fun with this set. When I first saw this set, I was jumping for joy. &quot;It has robots!&quot; I exclaimed. Super cool pieces and an awesome color scheme, who wouldn't love the X-pods. All I can say is, get this set, or the black version, It's worth the money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-26T16:00:41.75Z","Go, X-pods!","I got this set as a stocking stuffer one year. My first thought was: &quot;COOL! ROBOTS!&quot; This set has a very nice colour scheme and you can take it on trips with you.

Pros:
ROBOTS!:D
colour scheme is neat
easy to carry during travel

Cons:
I lost some of the pieces",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-02T08:51:07.103Z","LEGO Creator (X-Pod) - Robo Pod Review","This is a great little set to have and it's fun to play with as well. The build is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The main model we get is a small robot which you can see on the bottom of the cover of the instruction. The arms can be moved and you're also able to move the legs and the feet.  As I told you in the beginning: This is a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Lego_fan_","2019-01-03T22:04:35.39Z","Great green set.","<p>This is a nice little set I had gotten a number of Christmas&#39; ago when it was available. It is a Nice build and can be combined with 4348 which I also have to make a cool little plane like thing. It has a nice collection of Robots which are good for display and play with space themes. It also has a nice green part selection which I find useful. I would suggest this set to any X-pod fans or creator or Robot fans.</p>
