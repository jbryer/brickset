"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-04T04:08:16Z","Nice Xpod","This is a cool little set, but you can't do many nice small things for minifigs. If you add a Minifig and you can do hoverbikes as well, but the one I constructed with is pretty ugly, because it's really odd looking. But besides that, you can do nice pocket vehicles and as in all Xpods even use the pod itself.Or build while you are in a train or if you drive back home.
(Last thing only works when someone drives you in his/her car.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-17T12:07:48Z","Lots of (re)playability","There's not a whole lot of pieces, but the entire point of the set is do make 
something new with what you have, and there is a lot of potential for that in this set.
it's got lots of (re)playability, which is what legos really ought to be about.  
Excellent set, well worth the $4 or so it costs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-21T20:20:02Z","LEGO cashes in on a great idea...","...everyone's favorite genre mixed with everyone's favorite color is executed perfectly as LEGO's X-Pod idea is taken to another step. The little race car is excellent, and the truck is great, as well. The inspirations are fun to make and are all well built. However, I gave this a 6 because I have trouble thinking of a good rebuild factor. Four wheels is still four wheels no matter what you stack on it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-07T14:21:38.217Z","Little Cars","X pods have been an interesting theme from the Lego company. Lego does a good job on this set. You get alot of wheels and tires in this set and also directions to build cars and trucks. Lego did an excellent job on this set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legowarroir","2007-12-10T07:57:18.153Z","A nice little set.","This set is cool, it has over 3 different sets to buid inside it. You can also combine the aero pod with this set to make a ship. The bad news is it does'nt show all the instructions for the other sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"bmwlego","2007-11-09T20:25:59.297Z","Blue X-Pod is Not that Bad","This was my first X-Pod. I like the idea. Stuff a small amount of bricks into a cool little pod and viola, a small LEGO set that you can take on the go. The color scheme is my favorite, blue and light blue. The main model is ok but the inspirations are great. If you put this set's inspirations alongside the models from the creator 4915 construction set, you have a great little collection of mini construction vehicles. Out of my 3 X-Pods I own, this is my least favorite but I still like it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-14T08:20:55.343Z","Vroom!","Okay, so this is probably my favorite X-Pod of the series. You can make three models going by the instructions, a racecar (my favorite model myself), a cement mixer (the mixing drum can turn!) and a big fat guy with wheels for eyes. You can also build by the pics inside to build a bulldozer and a crane.

Pros:

-Lots of alternate models

-Canister

-Blue!

-Plenty of interesting pieces

Cons:

-None

Overall
6/5.  Excellent set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-02T08:46:15.023Z","LEGO Creator (X-Pod) - Auto Pod Review","This is a nice little set to have in any LEGO collection and it's fun to play with as well. We get a few models in this set and they're all very easy to build. We also don't need to worry about stickers. The main model we get is a race car. This car almost doesn't have any play features but it's very easy to maneuver it. The only play feature we get for this vehicle is that the rear wing sviwels.  As I told you in the beginning: This is a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
