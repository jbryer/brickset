Yes you read right, while driving! I unpacked it and threw all parts into the X-Pod. It was a bit more complex to build, as at home. Because I built it out of the Pod and those don't have that much room as the pieces that are arranged on a small heap. Like all X-Pods it's perfect if you are on a journey and they have really much potencial.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-21T20:06:34Z","Yellow!","LEGO definitely needs more yellow. This set is perfect for people who just love yellow.

As for the planes, there are some great instructions, as well as some even-better inspirations. Let your imagination go wild with this set... it is one of the best out of the four.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-08-17T02:42:26.55Z","My only X - Pod","I am not to impressed with this little set. You get a few useful pieces and can make a number of small models out of it but is kind of bland. Picked it up on sale for the pieces and to add another set to the collection. Probably best enjoyed as a simple set to keep in the car to entertain the kids.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-22T14:26:53.483Z","A whole array of aeronautical sets!","I was quite pleased with this set even though it appeared to be quite small. There are many interesting pieces in this set and even if you buy this set just for the pieces you should try building with the box art as they are quite interesting and brings fond memories of early childhood. (Reminisence, mister!) After a while you might run out of ideas to make and are prepared to dump the whole contents into your Lego storage in which those pieces might never be unearthed again for the next few years to come. Even the pods itself are of use. There are two yellow pod covers which can be taken off and used to create an umbrella. The transparent pod left has only one side hollow so the other side could be used as a stage to place MOC planes and spacecrafts as it is wholly transparent.

I wish they would continue making these X-Pods, they are nice! Get it now!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-01T10:27:23.603Z","LEGO Creator (X-Pod) - Aero Pod Review","This is a very cool little set to have and fun to play with as well. The set is very easy to build and we also don't need to worry about stickers. We also get a few models to build. The main model is the helicopter. It may doesn't have any play features but it's very easy to maneuver for sure. The only play feature which comes with this helicopter is that the propellers sviwel full 360Â°.  As I told you in the beginning: This is a cool set to have - even for 
pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or 
brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
