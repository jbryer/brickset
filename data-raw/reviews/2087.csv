"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-04T04:20:37Z","Great X-Pod","This X-pod makes some nice little creatures and is even great for a beautiful hoverbike. Just add a minifig and build the hoverbike for it. There's only one thing, that I don't like: Transparent 1x1 round plates are missing, but as this pod is for creatures it doesn't matter. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-13T18:54:32Z","Excellent!","Just picked it up today.  I love the color red, so this is definitely a plus.  I had fun building the dragonfly, the parrot, the crab, the fat guy(who, as was already stated, is not that bad in person), and a custom Star Wars Republic tank.  This set, though it has very few pieces, is very versatile.  The few pieces it has are very useful ones, and work well together.  I like how the container even works as a part of the model, or as a place to display them.  Very nice.  You know, I really like this X-Pod idea.  I think in a few days I may pick up the yellow one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-26T18:50:55Z","Unique Idea executed poorly","I had great expectations for this set above all X-Pods, because of the happy little critter on the front of the instruction booklet. This set has 44 pieces that are all inside one little pod. The fat little character in the booklet is actually not that bad in person. The unique idea of having a designer set &quot;on-the-go&quot; is excellent, but I don't think this set fulfills it. Besides the dragonfly and the ugly bird-like thing, there aren't any other sets. There are inspirations for sets, but they aren't that good. I had a lot of fun messing around, but you can't make decent looking creatures without running low on pieces. Unless you love red, Get a different X-Pod.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-05T16:15:52Z","best x-pod","i find this is the best x-pod for playing around with... i made a nice little oriental-style dragon with it which is probably my favorite model i've ever made myself. so this set gets big points from me!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-27T19:51:27Z","Awesome!","Okayyy... I bought this for colors for my .space faction at BZPower, and i only made  critters with this, the rest were robots and stuff... But this set is sweet!It's got -loads- of pieces! A must buy for any red-lover, or in the need of good pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-27T19:55:07Z","Very good.","I bought this for my .space Faction on BZPower,and i only built a few critters with it. And i think the sets possibility is great! Especially for Robots and Fighters, which is what i used it mainly for. A must buy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-18T13:30:51Z","Great!","Okay, I posted a review for this set when I first got it; now, a few months later, after the excitement has worn off, is this set still cool?

Answer: Yes!  In fact, it's grown cooler!  I bought this along with 8777 Vladek Encounter.  I played with 8777 more when I got these, but now 8777 lies nearly forgotten, while this set is still out and being built!  I love it!  I've built something that I call a &quot;crabbit&quot;(long story), which is my favorite creation so far.  But the possibilities are nearly endless!  Often if I'm feeling bored, I'll go and build something new and exciting with this X-pod.  I'd reccomend it to all builders and thinkers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-14T08:23:22.983Z","I don't have it now, but it was great","I wish I still had it, but for some reason I gave it to my little brother (he liked it a bunch), and after about a month it got lost in the LEGO box.  Oh well... Anyway, Pros and Cons.

Pros:

-Three models in one

-Canister

Cons:

-None

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-12-01T10:21:58.94Z","LEGO Creator (X-Pod) - Wild Pod Review","This is a good little set to have and fun to play with as well. We get lot's of little models to build. The build of these models is very easy and we also don't need to worry about stickers. The main model is a butterfly. The wings and the tails can be moved. As I told you in the beginning: This is a cool set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
