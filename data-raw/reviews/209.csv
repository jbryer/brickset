The build is nice and simple. The only play feature which we got here is that the tyres on the back move up and down. If you want to start building LEGO Technic sets I would recommend you to buy sets like these first before you get the bigger ones because they'll take you a while when you build them.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
