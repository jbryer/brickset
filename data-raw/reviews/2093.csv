I built all of those models with instructions but in total there are 17 models to build. Well the pieces are thegood old small ones, altough in some newer colors like light blue. The things I don't really like are the eyes, which look a bit weird but all in all it gets a solid 8/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I came back to edit this review because i was younger when i wrote this... and well there not much play uses in this, i mean the fish is bigger than those big rock monsters//</p>",TRUE,3,5,2,1,1
