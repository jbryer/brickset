You get instructions for the main speedboat model, a jetski, and an alright two-seater boat. The rest of the book shows you only pictures of the other models. Oh, and the sail that comes with the set for the windsurfer/catamaran is PAPER. Yes, you heard right, PAPER. You actually have to cut it out of the instructions. Now on to the set. The speedboat is cool and it uses a very clever mechanism for the driveshaft.(Four technic universal joints with a rack and pinion system.) The interior isn't bad, but needs just a little more detail. This set also includes four of the old space hoses in all gray. What was the last set to have those? I think this set has great MOCability with all of those pieces. (I made a cool spaceship with a docking port and sliding doors.) I think this is mainly a parts set, but that's my opinion. Overall, mesa tinks dat dis is a vewy good set.

Of all the sets I have built this gave me perfect fun building it for my son (and of course for myself). It too me a while with al the small parts, but hey that is really what is Lego all about.
Especially the interior mechanics to rotate the propellors at the back is a nice designersjob. Good details on mechanics in the boat as well. Only thing I think it is a bit of a shame that no minifig is included to put in the cockpit. The space in the cockpit is too narrow for a minifig anyway. 
According to the instructions we can create a series of other models with the parts of the set. Only problem then is you need to break down the fantastic boat again and we don't want to do that. 

According to me is this a top 10 set of the last few years and top 3 for 2003.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
