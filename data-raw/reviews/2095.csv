anyway, i really liked the main model even though i got it mainly for parts and not for display. bigger than i thought! that rotor mechanism thingie is ok, put pressing the walls feel silly..
lots of sloped part, i love those! i'm still thinking of a cool way to use that canopy in space mocs, but it's hard.
the problem now is that i don't wan't/is too lazy to tear it apart... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-11T23:24:46Z","sweet","Even if you dont like the main model at has a heaping pile of good parts. Landing gear works well and the rotor mechanism is silly, pressing on the walls. Althogh it works well and would rather have it than not. Very good set. Get it if ypu see it. Its absolutely worth the money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-08-10T11:42:14.69Z","a big one","i like this helicopter so much that i didn't cannibalize the set but kept it as such, when i bought it together with 4404. 
it is a big, sturdy and impressive model with an ingenious mechanism, perfectly made for youngsters (and adults :-) )to play with.
the parts that come in this set are also ok: lots of red plates and slopes, some technic parts, chrome parts, and a load of windows with rounded top. don't hesitat to grab this set if it happens to cross your paths!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"fluke73","2005-06-15T05:05:13Z","A great model!","I really enjoyed building the helicopter and it had alot of great pieces. I liked the funktions as well, both the way to spin the rotorblades and fold out the landing gears. Looking forward to build the others in this set as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BigMac","2010-08-21T17:26:42.717Z","A Very Beautiful and Big Technic Set, Best Helicopter from Lego.","I just bought this as an used item from Ebay for Aud 36.00. It was posted quickly to me, the parts and the instruction were almost in new condition, very happy with the buy.<div><br></div><div>Before I get this one I have built the helicopter from the creator set 4895, which is big but compare with this, I would say 4403 is about 25% bigger, it measures about 50 cm long.</div><div><br></div><div>Technically, I think this is really better than many Technic models, the mechanism to turn the rotor is clever and very playable. The landing wheels can be extended and retracted &nbsp;by just a pull or push of a key at rear of the body, a simple but very functional design.</div><div><br></div><div>Appearance, it looks very real and beautiful, it is comparable or even better than those model team helicopter. The red, white and black colour combination enhances the aesthetics of the set to an ideal. The very shiny chrome exhaust pipes glitters under the down light of my display shelf. It is very beautiful. Actually, the photograph of the original package box was taken at a bad angle, which is unable to show the best part and the proportion of the model.</div><div><br></div><div>It is truly playable too, when you squeeze the rear side panels the rotor turns at a moderate speed, I would prefer a bit faster, anyway, it is not too important. After stop squeeze, the rotor keeps on turning for about 15 seconds and emitting a ticking sound. I don't know whether this sound was purposely designed to simulate that coming from a helicopter but it definitely sounds real and great.</div><div><br></div><div>The build of the model is sturdy. Compare with 4895, 4403 is much stronger. I love the process of building the model, it took me about five hours to finish, a bit slow, but I enjoyed it.</div><div><br></div><div>To me, the price was good also, 700 pieces for only Aud 51.00 ( include postage), what else can you ask for.</div><div><br></div><div>Every aspects of the set deserves a FIVE.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading.</div><div><br></div><div>Brickmad</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
