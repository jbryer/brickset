I spent a long time in the shop deciding between this and the 'Air Blazers' and finally went for the helicopter. However, having just had this one I realise I made the wrong decision. Even after allowing for the &#163;10 or so difference in price, the 'Land Busters' is by far the better set.
There are many nice little touches that give it the edge. The tow bar, the wrap-around headlight lenses with lights behind, the bull bar, the sill plates, in fact the whole proportion of this vehicle is well balanced and has the look of a modern pick-up truck.
The body is attached to the chassis by two technic pins allowing it to be removed and replaced with ease.
The other two models in the set are a small motorcycle and a dragster, both of which are far inferior to the main model.
It is a shame the extra few elements are not supplied allowing the motorcycle to be made and positioned on the pick-up bed.

I can't wait to design a trailer for it! (maybe even a 'fifth wheeler').

The suspension is no use because if you press the model down, it falls apart.  The back is only connected to the front at the bottom and the back is also very weak in design.  The only model that stays together firmly is the motorbike, but you'd hardly pay &#163;45 for that.  An eight year old(as the model is recommended for) would hardly want this model, which is clearly only ment for display purposes.  I am sending it back today as it is such a dreadfully reinforced model.  The lack of steering is also a dissapointment.  Although the model looks amazing, and the suspension design is fantastic, but for people who want more than an ornament, I wouldn't recommend this model.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-22T03:45:37Z","good!","this set is a good one. the only problems are that its price is rediculous and it tends to fall apart quite easy. mine did that but i just re-built and now it doesn't fall apart.BUT THE WHEELS JUST KEEP FALLING OFF which is really anoying but i just replaced the part that joind the wheel to the suspension, it doesn't fall off as much as it did before but it still falls off. i think the suspension is SWEET and its a very detailed set. Lego should have made it so that if you push the springs on the car all the way down it doesnt push up parts on the back. if you like big sets or something that will take a while to build this is the set for you.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-30T22:41:23Z","Just incredible....","I am very impressed by this set. It is detailed enough to be a UCS truck or something! It has a V4 engine but who cares? You can always rebuild it! I love all the nice features like the suspension and the nice interior. The colors are great and it is not juniorized as it looks. It can also be built into two other cool models. I love this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-25T00:45:45Z","Land Busters 4404 / Good yet poor?","My boyfriend bought this set for me at my request as a gift, and I am very pleased with it, but mainly because it's for display purposes.  While assembling the model, it fail apart twice because the model has absolutely NO structural integrity.  

I am very disappointed by the fact that the suspension is detailed yet there is no steering, not to mention the level of detail concerning the chassis/body yet the engine is mediocre.  Sure, you could build a new one yourself, but considering the $60, the model should stand on it's own four-wheels and have everything available.

Overall, I'm pleased with it but only because it's a display model.  I wouldnt recommend playing with this particular model, unless you love constantly &quot;refirming&quot; sections of the body to ensure it stays together.  May be recommended to glue the pieces together if you intent to play with it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-12T19:46:41Z","Very nice truck","This is one sweet truck. Very detailed, big, and yellow. Includes a lot of usefull pieces to build a lot of trucks, cars and things like that. Plus I got mine for 50% off, a good deal. The only thing bad about this is that it doesn't steer, but I can fix that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-04-04T18:28:54.13Z","first designer set car","of course the model has all those weaknesses described, but peraps it helps to see it as the first car model of that size, being neither technic nor model team. it still looks really impressive and has a strong appeal, worth to be displayed. i tend to see it as a precursor to last years set 4896, which has less flaws, also belonging to the designer set series.
some parts of the set are unique and can't be found in any other model.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-16T21:48:35.67Z","awsomely detailed","this set has so much detail! the best is the motor, suspension, and everything inside the cab. everything is great, just one thing is they could use more smooth peices to get rid of most of the bumps. also it comes with instructions for some awsome modles. like the motor cycle, it is almost as detailed as the truck. the truck can seperate from the chasi, and you can get a good look at the working suspension wich works great since each wheel has a independent shock system. this is one of my favorite sets because of the little details such as the front/back bumber, working doors and tail gate the seats and the mirrors. and its easy to rebuild after it &quot;crashes&quot;

"BigMac","2010-08-21T21:40:04.897Z","Beautiful, Detail, but No Steering","I bought, 4404 and 4403 in the same week at almost the same price when including the postage. Actually, no postage for 4404 as I pick it up myself, so 4404 is more expensive. I built 4403 first and find it is outstanding (see my previous comment). I therefore had a greater expectation of 4404 when I start to build, because it is more expensive and has more pieces.<div><br></div><div>Pros.</div><div>- &nbsp;good suspension</div><div>- &nbsp;got the best designed car seats of this size.</div><div>- &nbsp;beautiful design of head lights.</div><div>- &nbsp;a &nbsp;very detailed carrier tray.</div><div>- &nbsp;nice arrangement inside the driver's cabin.</div><div>- &nbsp;stylish swing open door.</div><div><br></div><div>cons.</div><div><br></div><div>- No steering mechanism, having a car of this size it is absolutely fatal to the model.</div><div>- No movable engine block like most of the Technic models have.</div><div>- Not much to be played with.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, this is just a display model, very detailed designed for its appearance. Apart from the suspension, the designer of the set could have include one or two more technic mechanism to make it more playable. If the car comes with a steering system, it should able to obtain a Five. Compare with its immediate brother 4403, this one is beaten.</div><div><br></div><div>I give it a FOUR only.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks for reading</div><div><br></div><div>Brickmad</div>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,4
"Sarlic_Galt","2009-07-30T11:32:55.873Z","this truck is the best. it's a great set to add stuff to. SWEET","This truck is great. I built a lot of stuff on to it like
I jacked it up (put a lift on it), I put one of those boxes on the back so the it enclosed and so that i can hold much more stuff. 

The only big thing that I wished that they would have changed is the fact that it does not have steering and that there is no easy way to ad it in. 

Since I put a lift on it it's so much fun to off road with because the tire can go up all the way it can where as if you don't jack it up the fender room is limited because the body is so low.

So the set is old and it is very hard to find but if you see one for sale somewhere get it because it's fun and it could be worth something later on.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"modena","2010-11-21T10:43:35.573Z","My favourite!","This was my favourite set. I tried adding a winch from the 4604, but it didn't work. Anyway, it is really big and powerful...

It has lots and lots of pros, and don't care about the cons, as I was very little when&nbsp;I&nbsp;got it, so that's why I lost a piece or two.</p><p>So if you see it, buy it immediately, and you will never be bored!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
