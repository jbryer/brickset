"jof","2007-09-22T03:18:56.39Z","could do with a minifig","This is an interesting set.  A few rare coloured pieces, some nice bulk building grey plates for making station platforms etc.  A lot of windscreens &amp; a couple of tinted panels.

6 sets of good big wheels.  (They should have shipped some 1*6 arches to make wheel arches for these wheels).  They go well on 8 brick wide MOC buses made for minifigs.

Down side is no minifig.  It really could have done with a standard 'workman' to operate machinery.

And could have done with a few decent sized plates.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
