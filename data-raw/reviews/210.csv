"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-07T10:16:59.887Z","LEGO Technic - Buggy Review","This is a very small LEGO Technc set and it's simple as well. It doesn't have any minifigs but it's a good little vehichle to play with. The only play feature of this set is that the propellor on the back does sviwel full 360Â° when you maneuver this vehicle. It's a nice and easy build. It also won't take you as long as the bigger LEGO Technic sets. If you want to start building LEGO Technic sets I would recommend you to get these before you buy the bigger ones.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
