Now i can give my child a little present or give her the whole box. With al these parts combined with my old lego from the 70s her lego is all up to date. Just use your imagination. Now all daddy's gotta do is get of the lego and let my daughter play (aren't children great).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-17T10:30:41Z","Huh???","When I first opend this lego set I just looked at the packages inside and put them away. This is lego for my child when she's older. But after purchasing box 4496, I had a closer look at the differance between the two (both blue canisters with the same picture at the front. 4411 has 200 extra bricks inside. These 200 extra are not shown on the box and I believe they are random parts. Like the 4679 set with the 500 extra random parts. I found a blue door, a greenish see through part, a black sloped see through part (also in every other colour), wings, lots of space parts (including the new grey), parts I have never seen before (mayby i'm just old!!). I only wish they would make a whole box with these parts. A 1000 odd pieces, now that is a present. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
