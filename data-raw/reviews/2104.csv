"surfersofthemind","2005-05-23T19:08:45Z","A Classic","My first ever space lego. What more could a kid want in a lego set, rockets, laser gun, space man, wings. It may have been the first but not the last.

Looking back, for the small size and limited parts available then it was a well designed set offering hours of play. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-05-15T06:03:39.78Z","small and sweet","I found this one built in the little lego box which survived from my lego days. I put it apart and noticed i changed a bit when i was a child - back in those days my ideas of design didnt fit to those from lego all the time. But i just changed some bricks, the whole thing remained as it was sold by lego. I always liked it, it had this great space gun with a transparent green brick on it - so i took all my other transparent bricks to &#180;upgrade&#180; all other space guns i had. Everything you need for a good play on planets far away. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-26T20:38:46.827Z","A Classic","The first year of Space started off with a bang. The theme included sets including this one. I really like the design of the hovercraft and the tail is very cool too. I think it also includes a gun which is even cooler. 5 out of 5 for an awesome set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"seahawkeye","2008-07-01T08:45:08.857Z","Stylish and sophisticated","I bought this set when it was new and I was 10. That’s 30 years ago, and in that time, unlike me, it’s lost none of its freshness and elegance. In my opinion, the first two years of Legoland Space gave us some of the finest toys ever made, and this little scooter is a prime example. 

The groovy ray-gun, the cool exhaust pipes, the subtle manoeuvring thrusters, the seat for a passenger … everything about the design oozes simplicity and charm. For me it always had a swoosh factor of ten – easy to hold, easy to visualise myself in, and the perfect little craft for zipping over the lunar surface. 

I couldn’t afford the bigger ‘interplanetary’ crafts of this early era, but I found them a little clunky anyway. This little plane was all the best bits of a landspeeder mixed with just enough zippiness to feel like an x-wing. 

A gloriously simple and brilliant design.

"krysto2002","2008-07-24T06:27:47.047Z","A great set from the days of old","This is a great classic set though it is short of a little playability, since the set lacks accessories...

The overall set has a great design, and the colored parts are really cool, plus the undercarriage isn't blank like most spaceships. I really liked the multi-wedge plate shape of space ship bases, like those in classic sets, this one shows it. The ship does not lack an emblem, and the rotating laser (or whatever you think it is) is simple and cool. The tail fin is great, and the ship has an antennae (yay).

One more minifigure, a few clips, each with tools and accessories would have given the set a 5/5, rather than a 4/5 (7/10).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-08T12:25:42.233Z","The Perfect Size","This was the first Space LEGO set I ever got, and no matter how large my Space collection got, this was the ""hero""s vehicle.  It's not too big and clumsy, nor too small.  It has a nice elegant, smoothe look to it, and I imagine if it were real, it would handle better than any other Lego vehicle. Aside from the X-1 it was the only mid-size air vehicle and the much cooler of the two, IMO.  A wonderful little aircraft that only gets better with age.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Soundczar","2011-04-23T20:31:49.597Z","The Best","This is one of the classic small sets from the beginning of the Lego Space era.&nbsp; With it's multiple seats and unique engine arrangement, it is a joy to behold.&nbsp; It used swoosh from mission to mission without hesitation for hours of fun.&nbsp; It was the fastest ship in my fleet.&nbsp; Of course, you had to relocate the antenna if you were going to add a passenger, but that is a minor fault.&nbsp; Because of the low piece count, it does not have a great variety of pieces, but what do you expect for only a couple of bucks?<br>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,5
