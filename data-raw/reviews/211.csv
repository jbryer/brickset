The only play feature we get here is that the tyre on the back can be moved up and down if you push this vehicle. As in many LEGO Tecnic sets you don't get any minifigs as well but it's very easy to play with for sure. If you're really interested in starting collecting LEGO Technic sets I would start with this one. The bigger sets may be too complicated to build and they'll take a while as well...<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
