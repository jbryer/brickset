The way it made use of 1x2 transparent yellow plates to make the lights really pop is truly genius. And the 2x4 plate used at the base for extra stability is truly genius. Nothing, not even a raging soccer player, can knock this over now. An excellent set that will truly be at the top of every kids&#39; Christmas list this year.</p>
