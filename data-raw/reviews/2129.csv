<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building this set was a whole new experience and most likely the hardest set I&#39;ve ever built, it&#39;s magnificent in its final form and worth your money. Sadly you can&#39;t find it in stores so that&#39;s not good. Anyway, it includes 3 pieces and no minifigures :(, BUT you can cut out the football player from the polybag front and there you go, if you&#39;re lacking a ball, then don&#39;t worry, cause that&#39;s included on the polybag to be cut out too!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set includes many opportunities, and I&#39;m surprised that there are no alternate builds suggested. It is worth every cent, so worth, that I&#39;m going to my store now to get a refund.</p>
