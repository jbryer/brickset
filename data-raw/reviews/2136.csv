I was a little surprised when I recieved it, so I had no plans for using the peices, and I destroyed all my ROTJ mocs and setups (not too many) four days ago, so keeping it together for display made no sense. I opened the Castle Accessories at about the same time, then, on closer examination of Bib's armor, I noticed that it wasn't a robo/hightech/electro thingie, but a breastplate. Perfect for Castle. Now my king has good armor. Hurrah! And 3PO (different head, of course) looks like okay guard of something that isn't in existence. Overall, good for a castle collector.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-26T23:00:13Z","Great Figs, thats all.","The only reason anybody should get this set is for the minifigs.Or if your making Jabbas palace. It might sound wierd but this is my first r2-d2 and c-3po. I think r2 is really cute. And he can fit in so many vechils, Tie bomber, Geosain Fighter all of those. Fortuna is a great new fig to have. The door it self is a nice desighn but thats really all. So this sets a 5. Not for the door but the figs",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-26T08:20:01Z","Should be seen as a part of something greater","This set is difficult to rate, because it depends on what you already have in terms of other sets.

All by itself, this Jabba's message does not do much. There's three minifigs and a portal. It supposedly depicts a scene in the film where the robots attempt to pass by the major domo of Jabba's palace. That's all.

But that doesn't mean this set can't be put to good use. If you've already got stuff from other sets, then the minifigs make great extras to spice up stories based on those. What's more, I've built the porch in different ways to depict different locales.

The conclusion must be that this is not a good starter set by itself, but makes a great expansion.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-03T10:54:55Z","answer to trevor's question: (how) does the door open &amp; review: set is nice, the figs are sweeet","trevor, the door opens vertically, this means that it is stopped by the eye camera getting in the way, but it rises high enough for some minifigs to enter, one at a time of course

as for the set itself: Bib Fortune is awesome!!! i love twi'leks (aayla secura is HOT) and the males have this wise wizard look (as in KOTOR) 3po &amp; r2 have been included in too many sets if you ask me, but i didn't have any set with them included until i got this one. they are sweet but i can see a whole army of protocols and astromechs is kinda poitless unless you're planning on making a very big starship like a minifig sized star destroyer which needs many droids to keep running. (btw, is that huge star destroyer of the ultimate collectors series minifig scaled? too big? or too small?) as for the doorway its decent enough but i don't care for it as i bought it for Bib and the droids and the camera eye. the eye is nice, but the rest of the gate is kinda plain and nothing like its movie counterpart (where are those spikes at the bottom which gave it that massive and agressive look?) ah well, i won't be using this door much anyway. my only other complaint is that this set should have had a gamorrean added and give the jabba's prize set han carbonite + han fig + leia boushh and captured chewie, with new headsculpt with parted hair as chewie has in ROTJ) but i'm happy anyway
So to conclude: this is a very nice set if you're into collecting minifigs and mini vehicles (like i do) but not if you want many dioramas, though the option of connecting to jabba's palace is nice. very decent, recommended for the figs
the portal with the eye gets an 6, the figs a big 10, so that's why i give it an 8

The way the door opens is a good idea, it could be usefull, but R2 can't even get passed that door, he is too large!

This is great if you don't have R2 or C-390 which I didn't. Them and Bib are really cool. If you want to make a great droid army that turns on their masters this is great, paint 390 and you can have ranks. Anyway the door is okay but if you want this set as something more than a minifig builder then you got the wrong set.

I really like the amour Bib Fortuna weres and when I got it I needed a needed a new 3PO fig. 
Any way the eyeball thing on the door is a nice addition as well. The only problem is the size of the door. the door in the movie is about 10x the size of this door.

Get it if: You don't mind not getting Jabbas palace and adding Bib Fortuna and a door to your collection

Dont get it if: You hate bib fortuna and have 100's of C3PO's &amp; R2-D2's or if you don't want it and you don't have Jabbas palace.

  Of course, I don't really think that that is enough to say that it is that great a set, because the door looks as though it was thrown together, there aren't exactly a million uses for a Bib Fortuna minifig, a you could have just as easily got the two droids in the droid escape set.

"Blade","2007-09-14T02:11:36.56Z","An Outsiders Review","I cant get over the amount of reviews this set has and how many are no longer members. Well as I have said before I don't know star wars, don't pretend to. The only reason why I am doing star wars reviews is: They are LEGO and some people may appreciate an &quot;outsiders&quot; view on the models.

The model itself seems quite simple. A nice big door that slides open, which is really cool. You could make a seriously wicked fortress using these. The colour of the bricks are nice too. The other thing i noticed is the peg on the left hand side which suggests it is part of a set and connects on to it.

The thing that really grabbed me about this set is the mini-figs. For its size it has three. Definitely upping the playability tenfold. The strange little robot in white with blue is cool, then there is a tan guy which I think is a robot as well. The last guy is in all blue, come with a cape and a strange helmet. These guys make excellent additions to any space set if you are not a star wars fan.

Overall it is a nice model with alot going for it. I'm sure if I understood star wars I could give alot more detail but even without I feel this is sufficient. I think this model deserves a 7/10 as star wars models seem to be well designed and lacking nothing really.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Altough small this have good contents, like the minifigure of Bib Fortuna (with good details and too a  little cover) and of the two droids, R2-D2 and C3PO. These have a lego style and playability of one(except R2-D2, with the playability of an astromech droid from lego). The C3PO's and Bib's head have a different shape to have accuracy with the movie scene on the begginning of the final movie. The set isn't an army builder, because have three minifigures, one different in comparison with other. But is cool to build scenes, like if combinated with the sets Jabba's palace and Jabba's prize. The door is well made, don't only in building, but in colors too, like the brown, glowing orange and the skincolor as the main color of it. Another cool thing is the &quot;droid eye&quot; on the door, good positioned to play with. This set isn't poor, but small, well if combined with the set jabba's palace. Being small, this deserves be compared with small sets, comparing contents, price, playability and accuracy with the movie, because this set is from star wars. 

Some contents are more common on this set in the skin color, like plates in the door and plates under the building of it. Too a piece above the door that makes part of the building keeps a good design to the set. The brown plates at the skin coloured ones keeps the door closed, but don't have why make this opened, if opened, the &quot;droid eye&quot; lost it's place. Too ramp pieces(brown ones are included) are useful due to be and was used previously, and later on more sets. The orange pieces make effects on the colors and also on the design. 

This is a small set, but isn't cheap like others small sets from different themes due to be star wars, and with the price are included the royalty of the names from star wars. If you understand that, is easy see why the star wars sets are more expensive if compared with other sets in number of contents.

Like it's sister set, Jabba's Prize, this set has very little playability on it's own, but makes part of a whole when combined with that set and Jabba's Palace.
Being a small set, do not expect a high brick count or much variety in form or colour.  Afterall, it is trying to faithfully depict a certain scene.
Assembly is quick and easy, perfectly suited for younger collectors, but the finished construction is a little wobbly.  
Like I said before, if it wasn't for the inclusion of the new mini figure, exclusive to this set, it would not be worth buying, unless you are a someone who finds it necessary to complete the entire Star Wars line up.
