The playability isn't very high but if you purchase  &quot;Jabba's Palace&quot; it doubbles.

Buy one or two, if you like 'em buy more and challange my army of bob and gamores (and a totaly usless &quot;Hansicle&quot;!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T16:32:34Z","Fairly pointless, but you get Boba","On it's own, this set is fairly useless - the only reason I bought it was for Boba Fett.  Combined with Jabba's palace, I guess it would be more useful, however.  The GG is also kinda cool, but he needs a bigger axe.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-09T09:32:05Z","nice if you don't have these figs yet (only the gammorean is exclusive)","this set is only useful if you don't have the slave 1 and want a boba fett and han carbonite, or if you want the gammorean guard. All figs are very neat, though the gammorean could have used some colour on his head, he's a bit plain being all sand green. it's a li'l disappointing the boba and han carbonite figs are exactly the same as those in the slave 1. that means still a boba with his rocket jetpack stuck to his helmet, still a boba with a t-shaped hole in his helmet and a black head. since we all know what boba fett looks like thnx to ep 2, lego could just mold a new boba helmet with a closed visor and put a jango head underneath it. and still no real weapon, instead of a turned-around megaphone with an orange dot on it. han is still that flat brick, still no sticking out hands and head, still that pathetic 'not now leia, i'm tired' look on his face. so that's a little disappointing, but again, if you don't own the boba or carbonite han yet, than this is a must-buy, since they are still great. as for the gammorean, he's perfect with sand-coloured les and hands, a big axe and a nice detailed clamshell-headpiece lego chewbacca-style. and as lego chewie, the gammorean doesn't have any paint on his headpiece, it's completely sandgreen, which is kinda disappointing. but he still looks great nonetheless. now on to the scenery. man, i'm disappointed. this took me about one minute to assemble. it's totally plain and boring, consisting of only a few bricks (tan, brown and gray) forming some sort of wall with a mechanism on which you put han. you pull a lever on the top and han falls for about a centimeter! WOOHEE! well, actually it sucks. Why not make a nice and sturdy realistic rendition to the wall of the movie, with torches next to han. forget about the mechanism, you can make a better looking wall yourself easily. if you remove the smooth non-studded 2x2 dark grey plate underneath the mechanism, han can at least fall completely, which is far more interesting. and if you turn aroudn the figure on the mechanism and then have it work, he'll fall down facing the ceiling, which is usefull for creating the freezing scene in ESB in which that robot arm picks up the carbonite block and jsut drops it down on the floor.
a plsu is that it connects to jabba's palace, but also to jabba's message, for which i'm very happy, since i've got jabba's message, but not jabba's palace
To make a very long story short (i just keep going on, don't i)
buy it if:
*you want the exclusive gammorean (which is a neat addition to your lego sw collection)
*you don't have boba fett and carbonite han yet/anymore
*you are a completist (as i am)
* you have the other jego sw jabba sets

buy it not if:
* you expect some nice backdrop scenery
* you don't have jabba's palace (like me) or jabba's message (got that one, though)

rating: 5 for the scenery backdrop, 9 for the figs (since these are my first boba and han carbonite), an overall 7

"Gus_263","2008-05-03T14:33:50.34Z","good if you find it cheap","  This set is another set of the Star Wars theme, released in 2003. Featuring Bobba fett and a Gamorean guard, it also includes some useful pieces. Easy to build, due to the small size, this set have a good effect on the design, and combines some beige and brown pieces. 
  
  The gamorean guard is well detailed, a basic minifigure, but with a piece covering it's chest, a green piece with the details of the guard's head and armors, altough only green, it is well detailed. This minifigure have too some gray and brown details under this piece, and is increased with a big black axe, really useful to any warrior, and also nice, altough isn't much detailed. 
   
  The Bobba Fett's minifigure still like the former released, is basically an original minifigure, but the head is a black piece covered by the helmet, same of Jango Fett, well made in shape and in details, but it is too simple. With few printed details on the body, making the armor, and increased by the original Bobba's green jetpack, this minifigure is good and is an addition to any Lego Star Wars coillection. Altough the weapon included have the old shape, it still nice and useful, more due to the color and playability (the small size of the weapon makes it playable, altough don't have much accuracy with the weapon of the movie, like the new shape of the Lego Star Wars guns). 
   
  The set is basic, and made easily, using a small beige plate with the shape of a square as the base of the building. This set is increased with some brown and beige pieces making the small walls on each side above the plate, and these are simple, but resembles a small part of the Jabba's palace, and can increase a part of the set 4480 (Jabba's palace), together with the set 4475 (Jabba's message). On the top of each side, there are some orange pieces, used as torches, making more details, but it still too simple. Some gray and black bricks above the wall hang a plate with some printed details, featuring the Han Solo frozen in carbonite, in Lego style. Altough it is simple, is good detailed for Lego sets like this. The few building involved makes it too simple, and not much playable, but useful to any Star Wars or also Lego fan, it was a cheap option to get Bobba Fett, the Gamorrean guard (this is not much detailed or coloured like the new, released with the Jabba's sail barge, but is also well made, and compatible) and the Lego version of the frozen Han Solo. 
    
  Of course, it wasn't cheap as it could in comparison with the number of pieces, but it is due to the royalties with the Star Wars names, but it was cheap, like a small set. So, this set is an addition to any Lego collection, and still good, altough the pieces and details are not the best, it was released in 2003. If you found it cheap (like a small set, no more than 25 dollars), it will be a good chance to get more Lego Star Wars stuff from the episode six. In comparison with other Star Wars sets with this size and aproximated number of pieces, it gets a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"AFOSL","2009-03-30T08:39:46.373Z","Inexpensive Boba Fett","This set is part of the Jabba's Palace trilogy of sets.  On it's own it doesn't have much playability, depicting a single moment in the movie, Return Of The Jedi.  But when combined with the other two sets, Jabba's Palace and Jabba's Message, this little set makes sense and has it's place alongside the palace.
Combining all three sets in one box might make more sense to the adult fan but from a Lego business point of view, having these add on sets can only rake in more money.
For the collector, this set is a very cheap way of obtaining a Boba Fett figure, a character found elsewhere now in at least four, somewhat more expensive sets.
For a collector with more than their fill of Boba, I can't help but think that this set could benefit from a different character.  Boushh would have made the perfect addition to this scene.  Boba could have easily been omitted or placed in the main palace set.
Speaking of new figures, the Gamorrean Guard was unique to this set for a while and would have helped to make it popular, especially given it's low price point.
It is hard to rate this set as it's misgivings are made up by the clever way it was marketed.  It was part of a three box set, coercing the collector to buy all three and it was the cheapest way to obtain Boba, plus the all new pig guard figure.  All plus points, although one goes to Lego for shrewd business sense.  A couple of negatives are Boba - again, considering the wealth of Star Wars characters there are linked to Jabba.  Also, on it's own, this set has no playability for younger collectors.  For the negative reasons I have to deduct a brick. 4/5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>A cheap and fun little set, LEGO in recent years has stopped making LEGO Star Wars sets below the 15$ price range and for that I am a little saddened.

Case in point, Jabba's Prize gave you Boba Fett and a Gamorrean Guard, as well as the Han Solo Carbonite element.</p>

<p>Front of the box has a picture of the set as always, the background being somewhere in Jabba&#39;s Palace.

Instructions are easy to understand.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No special parts from this set&nbsp;except for Han Solo in Carbonite, but I consider him a minifig. Very basic parts with a lot of tan and brown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Gamorrean Guard: Fairly good job! He consists of legs, torso, and a sandwich piece . The sandwich piece has no detail and is solid sand green. It is a custom mold which is nice. The Gamorrean Guard looks nothing like the movie version though.</p>

<p>Boba&nbsp;Fett: This is my favourite version of him! He has a custom mold&nbsp;for his helmet and jetpack, which are all one piece. Underneath he has a plain black head with no printing. Legs are very basic. Torso has some nice printing but not a lot.</p>

<p>Han Solo in Carbonite: Han in Carbonite is just a plain black 1x2x5&nbsp;brick with printing. A minifigure&nbsp;cannot fit in it or hide behind it without its hands and arms being seen. The new Carbonite&nbsp;piece is a huge step up from this. I personally don&#39;t like this version.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>
