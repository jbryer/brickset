"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-28T21:21:35Z","very good...with a few flaws","I found this set very good and rather interesting because it is one of very few sets that is created off of a few second shot in teh movie. The only time that it is seen is in A New Hope and Luke is playing with a model of it. 
Pros
looks cool
a few new pieces
new red helmet

Cons
the wings move up to easily
it is missing the wind shield",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-20T12:01:48Z","great, set from a five sec. appearance","The only times the T-16 appears in the movies are in the garage scene in A New Hope, in which Luke plays around with a model and you can see the back of the real prop though an open doorway.
And the other time is at the end of Return Of The Jedi, when some planets are seen celebrating the end of the Empire, a T-16 flies over an exited Mos Eisley. That's it.

With that said, I must say Lego did a great job at recreating such a rarely seen vehicle. With the exception of the lack of windows everything is top-notch, from the overall shape to the big BIG cannon underneath the craft to the li'l details as the painted top-fin and the griffin images at the hull (these griffins were also featured on Luke's T-16 which this set is based of) the overall colourscheme used looks fine and seems to be accurate enough for my liking :P
About the lack of windows, including correctly shaped windows would have been very difficult/expensive to do in Lego, so I don't really mind the choice of not including them. And it doesn't make the vehicle stupid-looking or useless, since the T-16 is an atmospheric transport vehicle anyway, the real thing isn't supposed to fly through the vacu&#252;m of space as well.

The T-16 features wings that can move a bit up and down and the top-part (with the top-fin) can open to reveal a compartment big enough to put the added accessoires in. 

Speaking of which, you'll recieve the requisite and quite basic megaphone-turned-blaster thingie and electrobinoculars. These binoculais are failry big, nicely sculpted and true to the source material. They compliment the included figure as well, as he can hold and use the binoculars in a convincing way.

The minifig is simply called T-16 Pilot, though I presume it's supposed to be Luke, since the Skyhopper bares his logo's. But the fig sports non-removable visors anyway, so it's hard to tell if it's really Luke. Putting the identity issue aside, this guy rocks with a neat red jumpsuit and a great red version of the Rebel helmet.

On a side note, this fig could have made a pretty accurate pilot for the Lego Twin-Pod Cloudcar, which features Lobot (a guy who was never spotted inside the Cloudcar) as opposed to a generic pilot fig.

To conclude
Plus:
-Overall accurate design
-Large cannon, non-functional, it's Lego!, but it looks great!
-Some nice details
-Great colours
-Opening top, revealing storage compartment
-wings are slightly moveable
-blaster and electrobinoculars are nice accessoires
-great generic T-16 Pilot/Luke (?) minifig with cool helmet

Minus:
-no windows, but this is the only way to keep the design unmarred and the price low, so I don't mind.
-uhm... the fact that it's not that an important or somewhat boring and kinda unneccesary addition to my collection? NOT, this thing might only have a five sec. appearance in the movies and it's not important to the story at all, but this Lego version is just dead-on to the real thing and I won't take points off because of the not-imprtant-issue.

Conclusion: this craft is simply a perfect rendition of the real T-16, and while it's not important, it houses some decent playability and makes for some great imaginitive gameplay, like having this baby destroy the Death Star (provided you build a Death Star Trench yourself) or engaging in a ferocious dogfight taking on the Millenium Falcon. It's Lego... just imagine! with this great set that receives a flawless 10!

This is a very durable lego set and it is easy to put back together. I love how the top of it opens up to show a hidden compartment with a (megaphone type) blaster and binoculars. The gun on the bottom of the ship looks too bulky for the ship but it helps it stand very well for display purposes. The back motors look nice with orange transparent pieces. The controls of the ship are printed pieces which look very nice in the ship.

"AFOSL","2009-06-26T12:44:50.64Z","Nice Addition To The Star Wars Line Up","It seems as though Lego want to outfit the entire line up of craft and buildings found on Tatooine.  It certainly seems to be the planet that Lego have focused on the most, and their dedication seems evident with this small aircraft that only plays a very small role in all the Star Wars movies.  The first time we see the T-16 is in the form of a small model that Luke Skywalker is holding in his hand.  Most other shots of this craft are fleeting, like the view of the craft flying into shot over Tatooine at the end of Return Of The Jedi special edition.  In other shots, the craft is barely noticed, sitting in backgrounds or looking dismantled in a garage.
So, like a lot of other minor elements, it's nice that Lego have taken the time to reproduce the T-16 in brick form.  Not many other companies have gone to the trouble of adding the Skyhopper to their inventory.

Whilst the Lego design is not accurate, the model is still nice and instantly recognizable to any Star Wars fan.
The build is quick and easy.  The instructions are broken down into 21 main stages with some extra sub stages that explain the assembly of certain structures.  That's 40 small stages overall in a booklet that only has 24 pages.  Not bad.
To be fair, the Lego model is a fair representation of the actual craft, but with one major flaw.  The cockpit is open.  The actual T-16 has a sealed cockpit with canopy that keeps the pilot safely inside, away from external elements which might be harmful.
But like I say, the overall design of the Lego model is not ruined by this inaccuracy, and the design does work well.
The model has a storage compartment beneath the dorsal wing for holding the included binoculars and blaster (megaphone piece with orange stud).  The wing is mounted on two of those stiff click hinges.  Unfortunately, opening the storage compartment usually cause the wing to be pulled off  as click hinges can be very stubborn sometimes.  Other than that, the rest of the construction is quite solid.
Being a non military craft, the colour palette for this model is quite varied and uses a lot of reds and blues mixed in with the white and grey.  There are 6 printed elements in this set.  No stickers here and that is a good thing.

To round things off, the model comes complete with a brand new minifigure.  Lego could have just put another version of Luke Skywalker in the box and kept their costs down, but they decided that a specially produced pilot figure would be more appropriate.  That's a nice touch.
The figure is kitted out in a bright red flight suit and helmet.  He has a visor (painted on to his face) and black hands.  As far as I know, this figure is only found in the Skyhopper set.

This might not be the most collectible set from the Lego Star Wars range, and a new in box kit will barely fetch double it's original price tag, but it's still a nice addition to a collection and well worth owning.

While it technically appears in&nbsp;<i>A New Hope&nbsp;</i>in the background of Luke&#39;s repair shop on the Lars Moisture Farm on Tatooine, it is barely mentioned. LEGO&#39;s interesting decision to make a set for this enigmatic vehicle was surprising at the time (2003) and remains a bit strange today. No similar set was ever released before or after it.</p>

The only part of interest used in this set was the relatively rare 3-length 2x4 slope, two of which come printed.</font></p>

It is blocky, indeed downright wide, but it is also overly simple to keep it&#39;s price range at $15. The strange contraption beneath the vehicle appears to be some sort of blaster canon, but it really is just a stand. It&#39;s white color and ugly design bespeaks of a time when LEGO was searching for new sets to create for the original trilogy. The lack of an enclosed cockpit makes this set unrealistic and deviates it away from the true design of the skyhopper.</font></p>

Indeed, it is almost scale to the minifigure that pilots it. The use of printed emblems on the sides make it a very unique vehicle. And the ability to tip the dorsal fin back to reveal a storage space behind the pilot is very creative and provides a location to store minifigure accessories.</font></p>

One obvious one would have been to remove the white assembly underneath the skyhopper and replace it with either a docking station or a simpler kind of landing gear. That could have freed up some blocks to be used as a canopy for the cockpit. The blockiness of the set could have corrected by using a much narrower dorsal fin, but I feel that the set may have become to fragile at that point. Despite all negativity, the thickness of the fin was probably just right.</font></p>

The yellow head is the same as those that come with the Biker Scouts of 7139 Ewok Attack and 7128 Speeder Bikes. While the description of the set suggests it may be Luke Skywalker because of the dimpled chin, the head is not unique to Luke sets and, indeed, only appears as such here. The legs are standard red with black hips. The torso is a unique printing of a skyhopper flight suit in red showing two pockets and a black undershirt. The arms and hands are not unique. The helmet is a standard Rebel pilot helmet but in solid red, which makes this also unique to this set. Overall, a nice minifigure that we won&#39;t see again due to newer back-printing techniques and flesh-colored heads.</font></p>
