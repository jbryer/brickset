"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-21T16:34:10Z","Quite good......but with flaws","Why did they change the colour of the battle droid? and why not include a few clone troopers or super battle droids?

Well, now that i've got that out of the way, i can tell you that the geonosians are cool but both should have come with wings. Also they don't &quot;properly&quot; fit in the fighter itself, they do, but not properly.

Now to the pro's. Its good value for money though with not many usable pieces (excuse the flaw), also the cannon added a bit more playabilty and even more if you have the republic gunship or the jedi starfighter.


BUY IT IF YOU...
Desperatly want to recreate the clone wars (stock up on em if thats the case)

DON'T IF...
You want a ship thats actually fits a proper minifig or prefer something a bit more classical (go for a tie).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-26T07:53:19Z","Good looking, but wobbly design","All in all, this set is value for money. The color scheme is right, the fighter looks the real thing. And as some commenters have already noted, the cockpit is shaped properly assuming smell'o-steering. Other good points: Minifigs are nicely done, parts are interesting, and the design is interesting from a studs not on top (SNOT) point of view. Studs point in 6 different directions on this model.

That said, there are three distractions that make this less than 10/10.

First, why can I see the Geonosian pilot's feet from the side when he is standing in the cockpit? Seems a bit drafty for a space vehicle, doesn't it. Though given the Geonosians accurate sense of smell, they may take some drastic precautions against sweaty feet, who knows?

Second, the cockpit itself is completely bare. There's
no instruments, no levers, nothing.

And third, though the design is very interesting from a SNOT point of view, the fighter is not really solid. It consists of six differently oriented modules that are connected with technic pin connections. These are a quite loose, making the whole a bit shaky and prone to disintegration.

Result: three points off from a straight 10/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-09T10:17:29Z","this set is sweeeeeeeeeeeet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.......................................but has some flaws","almost everything is great in this set, from the nice and exclusive geonosians, to the differently coloured battle-droids, to the cannon, to the ship itself. though there are some flaws...

plus:
*the geonosians are exclusives and have nicely detailed bodys (painted pants!!!! that's rare in lego sets)
and great headpieces too, one of them even has an all new four-winges piece that goes around his neck as a double-holed cape, the other one doesn't have wings, but lego did that so that he fits in the fighter i guess
*two(!) battle-droids are included and they are coloured in some sort of reddish pink to match their counterparts form ep 2!
*the sonic cannon is awesome, with it's enormous radar-dish pieces (one of which is printed with hoses or something) it looks very dangerous and massive, it swivels too, great for blastin' those pesky jedi down, you can also store the geonosian's blasteron the base of the cannon (the blaster is just a regular lego sw gun, so in other words: one of those megaphone thingies)
*the ship is huge and is nicely modeled (fun to build), it has the right scale, colour-scheme and shape, plus it features ladder-pieces for the pilot to climb to the cockpit (he has to get up there some way, and since he doesn't have wings, this was a nice addition to the ship)

minus:
*the geonosians are nicely detailed, but just have repainted minifig bodys, they are supposed to be as skinny as the battle-droids since the geonosians made them (and as we shape our robots as counterparts of humans, like c-3po, so do the geonosians, their robots resemble their own species) the geonosians were as skinny as battle droids in the movie, so why didn't lego make them out of skinny pieces like they did with the life on mars figs? doesn't make any sense to me. now, only the wings, details on the chest and the headpiece can tell you that this is supposed to be a geonosian, too bad.
*the battle-droids, as well as the geonosian soldier, still feature those louse turned-around megaphones with orange dots instead of real guns. while i know people have been complaining about lego making too many unique parts for specific sets, that doesn't mean lego has to turn lethal weapons into some cheesy megaphones, give us some western or miniland police guns instead! also, the battle-droids still have these 1 x 2 bricks on their back, in the right colour of course, but it still looks a bit silly
*i like the printed part on the cannon, but others may not
it doesn't come with some sort of greenish translucent piece to resemble one o'those sonic blasts that came out of the movie cannon
*the fighter falls apart pretty easily
the cockpit has no steering wheel. i know geonosians smell where they are going, so i won't complain about the pilot not seeing anything, but they don;t steer with their nostrills do they?
there are gaps at the sides of the cockpit, thus, there won't stay any oxygen inside the ship and the hands and feet of the pilot are exposed to the coldness of space, pretty goofy if you ask me
those long wings at the front are nice and add a lot of attitude to the ship, but it's not very useful for custom designs, without making something that looks very similar to the basic design, thankfully, the long wing parts still have some studs on it

to conclude: 
despite some flaws, it is still a great set, the completed fighter is pretty huge and has a nice shape with those long wings, the minifigs rock (although new, thin body's for the geonosians would be better) and the sonic canon is the final touch that makes this set a classic
good job, lego, you couldn't have done it much better, okay, i'll just shut up now

It holds a good design, the &quot;maroon&quot; colored battle droids and the unique geonosian minifig. Unfortunately, this set was in the shadows, because of the almost legendary republic gunship (7163) and 
AT-AT (4483).
    Probably the most major flaw, is the fact that they only included 2 of the maroon battle droids.
This is a good set, no matter how bad it may be for value, but it is extremely unlikely to be considered for re-release, considering that it was made to go along with the republic gunship.

The fighter is built very well, with some very rare parts and a very intelligent design. One of the best Star Wars fighters (and cool design too).

You get two rare Genosians, which are amazing.

The turret you get is pretty cool, and it neatly completes the extremely buyable $20 package. But again, it's not really a selling point.

Great parts.



Cons:

As was mentioned, you don't get anything to fight the Genosian army this set includes... but that's not a big deal if you have an imagination or another set (or both). 

The fighter is complicated to build.

Both blocks are finished with a 3 piece ball and socket assembly.&nbsp; The blocks are laid in line from each other down the centre of the fighter with their ball/socket assembly facing either end of the craft, front and rear.&nbsp; The front assembly is then fitted with a long laser weapon and the rear has a small translucent orange disc fitted to simulate an engine or exhaust port.<br>The sides of the fighter are then built using only four pieces each - 8x2 plate, 2x2 plate and a 2x1 plate, covered with a 6x4 curved wedge.&nbsp; The sides then attach to the aforementioned blocks, held in place with the Technic pins.&nbsp; It's a neat and sturdy construction that is a lot simpler in practice than how I've described it.<br>The instructions then move on to the top of the craft, which is an almost mirror opposite of the base, and is built in the same manner.&nbsp; The only difference is that the top has a removable access hatch made from a clear dish.&nbsp; This area serves as a cockpit for the wingless Geonosian minifigure, who slides down between the the two in-line blocks in the centre of the craft.&nbsp; From the box art, the fighter doesn't doesn't look like it has any space to contain a pilot.&nbsp; That it has is a nice surprise.<br><br><h4>Sonic Weapon</h4><br>In addition to the fighter itself, 4478 also contains a weapon used by the Geonosian warriors during the arena battle in Attack of the Clones.&nbsp; It's a bulky construction and is well made.&nbsp; It shouldn't fall apart with normal use.&nbsp; The actual laser assembly consists of a series of large discs, skewered through the middle by a Technic axle.&nbsp; 2x2 Plates keep the discs nicely separated, and the last disc is fully printed on the face side.&nbsp; Further forward of these discs sit smaller discs and a small cone with some translucent orange pieces mixed in to suggest a high power weapon.&nbsp; This laser construction is then attached to a base via a small turntable and a click hinge.&nbsp; This means the laser model is posable and can face up, down, left and right.&nbsp; The laser also contains a small platform for the winged Geonosian warrior to stand on, as well as two handles to hold on to and aim the laser.&nbsp; <br><br><h4>Final Thoughts</h4><br>The Geonosian Fighter represents a good effort by Lego to produce a faithful rendition of another craft that spends very little time on screen.&nbsp; It may not be as iconic as some other ships seen in Attack of the Clones, or any of the Star Wars movies, but it's still a nice addition to anyone's collection.&nbsp; Although a little wobbly in places, due to the slightly unusual building techniques used, the model is still quite sturdy once complete.&nbsp; The range of parts, whilst not huge in quantity, is varied and interesting and contains some specialized elements, not widely found in the majority of System based sets.<br>The colour palette is a little drab, mostly consisting of browns and greys, but this only helps to keep the model as authentic as possible.&nbsp; Any of the brighter colours (white and blue) are well hidden within the middle of the craft, with a little orange escaping to the outer surfaces, mostly to depict areas of high energy.<br>The unique minifigures are a nice touch and will certainly add some extra value to this set, even though it was very reasonably priced when first released and almost hit the magic price per piece ratio.&nbsp; The sand red battle droids will be of particular interest to anyone wanting to faithfully recreate the opening battle of the Clone Wars.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

THE SET : A mounted turret and a Geonosian fighter make up this set.&nbsp;While the turret is of limited use&nbsp;other than for recreating&nbsp;the Battle of Geonosis it is still very good, with an excellent range of poseabilty and a place for the&nbsp;Geonosian controlling the turret to stand.&nbsp;However, what really drew me to this particular set was the fighter.&nbsp;The laser cannon&nbsp;at the front and the engine at the back are both on ball joints which makes them moveable.

The background is a shot of the Geonosian landscape with the sand red colour being the most prominent feature of the box.</div><div><br></div><div>The instructions were faultless, no mistakes and I had no missing pieces.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The parts in this set are good, as I mentioned earlier they are mainly in the rare sand red colour, which could make them desirable. There are also some exclusive pieces, such as the totally new Geonosian heads and the wings which fit on one of them. Unfortunately only one set of wings is included so the pilot will have to stay as the pilot, and not another warrior.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><h4></h4><h4 style=""border-style: initial; border-color: initial; ""><font color=""#000000"" size=""2""><span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 16px;"">It is here that the set really shines. These Battle Droids are totally exclusive in the sand red colour and they include backpacks unlike most Battle Droids which is interesting. You get two Geonosians, one is a warrior, the other is a pilot without wings. The Battle Droids and the Geonosian Warrior both have megaphone blasters. Both have a huge amount of detail on their torso and legs, with lots of gold and red armour plating as well as their skeletal bodies. It is a shame that there is only one set of wings as it would be nice to be able to make two Geonosian Warriors but you can't have it all can you?</span></font></h4>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build is fairly good, but very easy, it took me about twenty minutes start to finish and uses some SNOT (studs not on top) building techniques.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I love the model as a whole, the Geonosian fighter looks really nice and accurate to the film, the sonic turret is a decent addition to the set but it is the&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;that steal the show, as they are all exclusive.&nbsp;The&nbsp;colour&nbsp;is predominantly sand red but with hints of tan and dark grey. There is a cockpit which can be&nbsp;accessed through the removal of the translucent dome on top and a swivelling turret, mounted on a ball joint at the front between the two distinctive prongs. The turret on the ground is of little use, but could be included into a display very easily.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I am hoping the rumoured Geonosian fighter appearing later this year will get at least to this standard if not better! I would certainly recommend this to a friend to be used as part of a scene from the battle of Geonosis.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall - 9/10</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"LegoCollector125","2011-08-07T10:13:04.163Z","The Battle of Geonosis","<p>This was my first Episode II set, and it has been one of my favorites ever since. Let's get to the review:</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box for the set is, as always, visually appealing and looks very nice. The insructions are set against a nice blueprint-like background, and are well coded for colors. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The set includes a great selection of parts in various colors, including the Burnt Orange and Sand Red pieces. There are also several new printed parts, and then there are the minifigures. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The set includes 2 Genonosians, one with wings and one without, along with 2 Sand Red battle droids. All the figures are exclusive to this set, and all of them are absolutely amazing. </p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build also showcases several interesting techniques, particularly in building the Geonosian fighter. The wings are connected in a very interesting way using technic pins. The cannon also uses a few interesting methods, and overall the build is very enjoyable. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The finished piece looks great, and is very streamlined. The cannon easily gives the effect of a massive anti-aircraft sonic gun, which I like very much. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, this is easily one of the best Episode II sets, with great minifigures, and a fantastic finished product. In comparison to the new Geonosian fighter, this one far outshines it, especially in the minifgure area. Highly recommended for any Star Wars fan, or LEGO enthusiast alike. </p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"biggestlegofanoutthere_b_l_f_o_t_","2012-05-13T01:20:10.94Z","Worth getting!","<p><b>Box:<br></b></p><p>The box is simple, shows off the action scene and the play-features. This set was originally released back in 2003 with set 4482 as an exception, unlike all the other AOTC sets which were released in 2002 (when the movie was released). This set is available with 2 different box variations because it was released two times, unlike the AT-TE which was only released once and was only available in one box design. The <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?S=4478-1"">black box</a> (2003) and the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?S=4478-2"">blue box</a> (2004).</p><p></p><div><br></div><p><b><a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=4478-2"">Parts</a>:&nbsp;<br></b></p><p>This set has many parts that are decently rare and some that are unique to this set. You get some very nice printed tiles for the 2 blades on the fighter, also some ladder pieces which are located on either some of the cockpit and some round dish elements used for the Geonosian cannon. You also get the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=44827pb01"">Geonosian's wing blades</a> which have only ever been in this set and are worth heaps. The parts in this set is one of the reasons you may want to buy this set.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Build:</b></p><p>The build was very neat and both the starfighter and cannon were very enjoyable to build. I also liked some of the SNOT techniques they used on the starfighter, by putting the side panels on and making the middle hollow. This set took me approximately 20-25 minutes to assemble.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Characters:</b></p><p><b>- 2x <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=sw061"">Battle Droid</a>s:</b> I can almost&nbsp;guarantee that each and everyone of you have at least one Battle Droid. But this is no ordinary Battle Droid. This is the Geonosian Battle Droid, which was only ever seen during the Jedi Battle on AOTC and has only ever been in this set. He does also have a 2x1 tile on the back which is supposed to be his back pack I'm guessing. They do both come with guns, which is also quite cool. Only difference between this and a standard Battle Droid is that this one is a little darker in all parts, kind of an earth orange.&nbsp;</p><p><b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=sw062"">Geonosian</a>: </b>This figure only ever comes in this set, as well as all the other figures that are included. He is just like the other Geonosian that comes in this set, except for the fact that he doesn't own a pair of wings.<b>&nbsp;</b>He supposedly does all the work and labor in the Geonosian society and he is also the pilot of the Geonosian Fighter. He is also referred to as the drone.</p><p><b>- <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?M=sw078"">Geonosian&nbsp;Warrior (With Wings)</a>: </b>This figure is very rare and is worth heaps on his own. He is identical to the other Geonosian figure we get, except for the fact that he has <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=44827pb01"">wings</a>. The <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=44827pb01"">wings</a> are very rare and pricey alone, this figure can go up to 20 to 30 dollars with <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=44827pb01"">wings</a> and 10-15 dollars for just the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=44827pb01"">wings</a>. The <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=44827pb01"">wings</a> are only ever found in this set and unlike any sort of cape, these are plastic and not fabric.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Set:</b></p><p><b>- Cannon: </b>The cannon is very simple, but built quite nicely. The level of detail on it is quite nice and I can't really say if I like this cannon better than the one that was just released in 2012, set <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9491-1"">9491</a>. This one though I kind of like because it's smaller. Geonosian cannons aren't supposed to be that big as far as I know. You are to stand your Geonosian warrior on the little hinge piece and give him the 2 levers. A place for the gun is also required. I will do a full review on <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9491-1"">9491</a> upon request.</p><p><b>- Starfighter: </b>The Geonosian starfighter is a very strange design, quite similar to Dooku's Solar Sailer. I do own both of the fighters as well, so I'll be able to give you a quick idea on which one is better. The new one is just the fighter alone and it does not come with the cannon, the cannon is sold&nbsp;separately. This fighter is a bit smaller compared to <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7959-1"">7959</a> in length, and the color scheme on the new one is a lot better, this one looks kind of messed up with the tan and printings. The new one is also a bit more&nbsp;structurally strong and better for display. This one though has better mini figures and the level of detail is tons better. The new one does also have the cockpit with the actual seat, vs this one which is just a bubble and the figure is crammed inside. This one also doesn't have the hatch on the bottom for the bomb. So kind of up to you, yes the new one is improved, but this one is also pretty cool. I will do a full review on <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7959-1"">7959</a> upon request.</p><p><br></p><p><b>Summary:</b></p><p>At the end, I think this set is very nice, even though there are newer versions of both the cannon and the fighter. The fact of the matter is, both the cannon and the fighter are a lot more detailed in this one, but the newer versions are stronger and better for display. This set is also quite rare and very expensive, can lead up to $160-$300 for a brand new one, which is quite insane considering this set was only $20 retail. Buy it if you can.</p><p><br></p><p><b>PROS:</b></p><p>- 4 exclusive mini figures</p><p>- NO STICKERS! TONS of printed pieces!</p><p>- Both the cannon and the fighter have great detail</p><p><br></p><p><b>CONS:</b></p><p>- The Geonosian has to get crammed inside and there are no controls or levers in the cockpit.</p><p>- The colors on this are a little messed up compared to 7959 (not really a hug complaint though)</p><p>- Pricey</p><p><br></p><p></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
