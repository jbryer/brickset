"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-29T02:05:43Z","Fantastic looking and fun to play with!","Released in 2003, this set is a real pleasure to build and is extremely fun to play with. At 229 pcs, this set includes a TIE Imperial Pilot and the highly playable bomber itself. It comes with a bomb hatch so you can &quot;drop&quot; bombs and another hatch that fires a &quot;missle&quot; at whoever/whatever you want. Talk about having fun!!

In addition, the TIE Bomber is pretty solid and can be put through the paces with the best of them. Details are good and the colors are the same as the other TIE vehicles (TIE Advanced &amp; TIE Fighter). 

Good set and a must for anyone that wants to complete their TIE fleet!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-05T04:18:32Z","Whole lot of shakin' going on...","The third in the line of TIE fighters (one to go, the Interceptor) and of all, this one seems to have the most play features.

Very nice use of the extra cabin; it has a huge cannon inside that can spit out a missile in a split second.  In the cockpit I miss controls for the pilot, which is a pity.

The TIE bomber is a BOMBER, which would suggest that it contains a shipload of bombs, like a B52 during WW II.  However, even with a huge storage room for plenty of grenades, with just three small round bricks this TIE is more suitable for precision bombing.  The bombs themselves do not fall out with easy, you've got to shake the bomber until so it will drop its load...

The worst part of the vehicle must be the connections between the different cockpits and wings.  With the TIE advanced and the TIE fighter this is already wobbly, but this intensified with the bomber as it has two cockpits, with in between the same type of connection.  This makes the vehicle extremely wobbly, and that's really a shame.

All in all it's a very nice copy of a TIE bomber, but it misses out on some parts (bombs, connections, cockpit controls) but I guess for a kid it's a great toy.  Therefore, a 7 out of 10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Its a great set to build an empire with, and i got 6 to have pertrolling my room.
Its got a good play facter, what with all the weapons (bombs and missiles, both working), however its still got that ANOYING wing connection which time destroys which is a shame as that is one of its only downsides.

I'd get. I'd definately get it if you build empires.

Still the same, still looks good. The craft its self is fun to play with. At the back of the cockpit is a carpantment that drops little clear blue bombs.[which can be lost easy]. The other conpartment is the Missile pod. Pull the leaver at the top and fire away. But for some reason mine fires by its self as soon as you put it in the shooter again. It could just be mine, im really not sure. If you dont have the set with the tie Advance, you can make it by taking away the misssile part, and attach the wing to the cockpit. Other wise good set if you like the ties.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-02T11:29:38Z","My favourite Tie by far!","Sure there is only one guy, but look at what you get: bombs, a sceond pod that faires a missle (sp?), one of those pilots (a cool fig.), oh and the ability to detach the sections and form another Tie (Advanced, Interceptor, etc.) I built an interceptor by modifying the wings and taking the original Tie's cockpit. It looked pretty cool.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T07:23:50Z","another tie to the collection","Finelly they came out with the tie bomber, ive been waiting for this for sooooo long. the ship is all around sweet, the missle is a realy cool feature in it, the tie bomber wouldnt be a bomber without dropping bombs in the back. and i like the pilot, just but a gum in his hand and he looks like a cool storm trooper comander. the only flaws with this set is that the whole ship is a bit wiggly and the bombs alwas get jamed in the drop section.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T16:36:15Z","Nice, but they still use those annoyingly loose connections for the wings","The playability of this set is very high, especially with the rocket launcher in the second pod.  Looks good, although for some reason the 'stand' on the base of the ship annoys me.

One of the failings of all the TIE range is the way the wings are connected to the body - they tend to move around a bit more than you'd like and tend to come apart.

However, it's a good set and one I can highly recommend (even if you do get only one figure with it).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-08T12:01:48Z","Nice working features","Having exhausted all other Star wars sets currently available (including the recently released excellent revised Millennium Falcon) I eventually decided to get this set which had never previously inspired me. My main motivation was something to do last weekend, but also in anticipation of shortly to be released 10131 so I would have the TIE set. Once again I was pleasantly surprised, wishing I had bought it sooner. I found it to be an accurate representation of the prototype with clever sliding bomb bay retained by a rubber band and a working missile launcher. I do not personally like the use of colours such as tans and blues as it is grey and black in the movie, but I see this colour scheme is to be retained on the forthcoming TIE set, and although it doesn’t look too bad compared to some, but why can’t they all be grey? I thought it was good value for money compared to some current SW sets such as 4501 that I am still resisting as a rip off. 

Overall I give it 9 for accuracy and working features, but it fails a maximum due to the bright colours.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-06T13:34:24Z","Quite good","This was the first set I purchased. I like it, it looks like the original one, though I don't really like the thing you can throw by pushing the button. I know legos are toys, but it makes it look too much like one, and as far as I know, other SW sets don't have that kind of &quot;weapon machinery&quot;.

Also the hole structure seems shaky to me, even a bit to much. BUT this set is cool and everyone should have it in his SW collection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-05T23:39:01Z","Chocks Away","I got this set yesterday as I was bored and hadn't got any lego since christmas. This was the only SW lego set MYERS had besides the new X-Wing, but I am planing on saving up for alot of episode III sets once they come out. I got this one for $49.95 aussie dollars, but could have got it for cheaper at Toys'r'us. Good choice, I would say so. The missile is cool and the fusion bombs are wicked. It is a great addition to the TIE family, which means all I now need is a TIE Intercepter. This set also seats a pilot, but should house two and it does not come with controls. But with a few bricks and more imperial Pilots you could fix these problems. The flaps can open and shut (obviously) and you can fire the missile and the flaps will open anyway. The wing design is good and it holds onto the pods better than the original TIE fighter. 
Pros:
* Imperial Pilot (can never have enough of these)
* Missile pod
* piloting pod
* Blue-cylinder fusion bombs
* Better wing construction
* pull away the back of the piloting pod to realese the bombs
Cons:
* No controls
* only one pilot

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-26T20:46:17Z","Wow, look at it!","            This set is real jumpy, it has alot of the good pieces, alot of plates, a great minifig, but most of all, IT IS A TIE BOMBER! Because this set was slightly shown in the movie, hardly noticible, it makes the people wanna grab it! This set has alot of nifty stuff. The first pod you build seats the pilot, and behind him, the payload of plasma-fusion bombs, These are clear blue cylinders. the pilot comes with no controls, a defanite fix-er-upper. The second pod holds the cannon. Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those real shooting things with the little dart that shoots out of the tube- and it is in an aircraft. This cannon is guarded by flaps and you cant shoot the cannon well if the flaps are still covering it, but if you move the flaps, then pull the lever.and........CHANK....... the cannon just shot. The pylons are cool, they are just like the TIE Advanced. This is a 9 because of some minor defaults, but........this is a super 9, so get it now, or you will pay the conciquances. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

     pros:
 -TIE pilot minifig
 
     cons:
 -brown head
 -only one minifig for the TIE Bomber, a large set
 -no tools or minifig equipment (at least a blaster or 
   something)

PIECES: 10/10
     pros:
 -two imperial insigmas on the wings
 -no stickers, thank you lego!
 -TIE cockpit (windshield piece)
 -three translucent light blue cylindrical bombs (four for 
   me, as I got one as an extra piece)
 -large plates for the wings and quite a bit of classic 
   bricks
 -not to many large specialized pieces
 -dark blue translucent 1*4*3 thin brick (behind cockpit)
 -black missle launcher with light grey missle
 -two specialized printed flag pieces

    cons:
 -no controls in cockpit

DESIGN: 8/10
     pros:
 -brilliant bomb compartment, involving slopes and
   rubberbands and such
 -missle pod is fun and sturdy
 -includes several details, including thrusters on the
   back and the targeting sensors on the bottom
 -not prone to falling apart

     cons:
 -TIE is connected in sections by a series of peg pieces,
   causing the TIE Bomber to be a little wobbly, but be
   assured that this doesn't make the TIE less sturdy
 -lack of creativity in the cockpit

I got theis set long ago, it's packed away, and I don't remember everything it has, but I remember the basics.
Well, what we have is Darthe Vader's Tie Fighter only with another middle section. It holds together very nicely so the playability factor is high. There's not much to say about the cockpit. The pilot has enough room to fit inside and fly the Bomber. If I remember correctly, the bombs are in the cockpit section. Since I haven't played with this in a while, I'm not sure how the bomb dropper works. But I think you pull something in the back, releasing the bombs. But if I remember correctly, the bombs will sometimes get stuck and won't fall out.
The second section just has a cannon. It also has ""Shutters"" which aren't necessary to open when firing the cannon. The force of the missle will open them for you.
Overall, a great set. If your a big fan of the original trilogy, I'd say get this set. It's great to play with and ""fly around"" and have space battles.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Chills","2012-04-18T11:39:31.89Z","Classic SW set, good addition to the TIE collection","<p>In an effort to expand my SW Lego collection without destroying my wallet I bought this set used on ebay. All the pieces were there and after some heavy cleaning they look almost-new again. Overall I'm happy with the set, as it rounds out my TIE collection, but it suffers from some of the issues the other TIE sets of era also had.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: As I've mentioned in other reviews I'm a big fan of ESB, and even though the TIE Bomber has very little screen time it is an iconic ship. This Lego set does justice to the Star Wars model makers. The set has the details one looks for, the double pod design, the bent wings, the bombs (gotta try to flush out the Falcon from the asteroids), the Imperial look to the set... they all take you back to the movie.<br></li><li>Pro 2: There's great playability with this set compared to the other TIE sets. I like the door that slides to drop the ""bombs"" out of the bottom, and I like the ""poke your eye out"" missile in the second pod.</li><li>Pro 3: The build was pretty fun. It didn't take long, but it was cool to see how Lego used some pretty standard pieces to make this set.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: As with the other TIEs of this era the connector joints aren't very sturdy. And since the pods and the wings are all connected in the same manner this set it tends to be a bit fragile.<br></li><li>Con 2: This is a small thing, but there's no control panel in the cockpit. I think every ship that I've seen in the SW line-up have a control panel (the pilot needs one, doesn't he?... or she?)<br></li></ul>
<p>The TIE Bomber is a pretty cool set, and one that I'm happy to have in my collection. Some may not like the blue pieces, and compared to the newer TIE models with all grey I must admit the coloring takes away from the sinister look the ships had in the movie. But all the same I think it is a good set. It has the details you'd want to see from the movie, good playability, and the build was fun. These sets can get pricey since they seem to be highly sought after, but if you're willing to part with the cash I recommend getting the TIE Bomber. On a side note, I wonder if Lego is going to re-release this set as it has with the TIE Fighter and Darth Vader's TIE. I could go for a more detailed, all grey/black TIE Bomber.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,3
