The highlight of this set for me was the trans-green frog, which became the most holy frog of life. This set is a good base to build on top of, which I promptly did. 
CONS: The sides of the torture chamber need to be filled in and Jabba is just a green blob.The trapdoor breaks too easily and the set needs more people. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-05T01:08:25Z","Huh??","This doesn't even resemble Jabba's Palace.  They should have made it one level instead of two.  There is no room on top for frozen Han, more aliens and the famous band.  You can fit about 3 mini-figs up top and they have nothing to do.  Oh well, there are some cool elements and figures.  Lego rules when it comes to Star Wars vehicles, but so far they have totally sucked when it comes to scene and location sets. (check out their version of the Cantina and Cloud City to prove my point.)This set does not really have the feel and look of a Star Wars movie, and this is because nothing was done to make it resemble Jabba's Palace from ROTJ except they put Jabba on his big square throne, but that's about it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-08T18:37:38Z","What you can expect for $30","This set is a typical lego rendering of a movie scenario, resembling a playset in architecture more than an accurate building. That's what lego goes for, and it works for the fanbase they go for, as well as for my wallet. $30 is still pricey for my budget, though.

The Good:

architecture:
When finished, the palace is an imposing foward-facing structure that opens ominously to reveal the dark dungeon into which Luke may fall. There the master droid EvE9d9 and the gonk droid wait to observe what fate might await unlucky Jedi. The height of the second level isn't accurate to the movie, but is made up for by the two really nice staircases that go down the sides. And the front gates are absolutely awesome!

figures:
EvE9D9 and Gonk (two nearly legendary background droids)
Luke in prime Jedi Knight attire
Leia, Lego's tribute at last to that metal bikini 
         (wierd, yes, but still welcome) (I think)
Jabba the Hutt, the baddest bad guy this side of the outer rim! The only place to find him minifig'd. 

The Bad:

Other Sets Not Included:
Yup, Lego pulls the old multiple-set one on us this time, and it doesn't quite fit together. To complete the Return of the Jedi Tatooine scenario, Lego released the Jabba's Message and Jabba's prize sets, the first of which contains 3PO, R2, and Bib Fortuna (awesome fig!), and the second of which contains a Gammorean Guard, Han-sicle, and Boba Fett. Both these sets qualify as economy sets on my radar, but they're a stretch for $7 each. While they are designed to interface with the Palace set, they are stand-alones, which means they don't fit in like a wall. As a result, Jabba's Message--containing the three figs against a wall that opens like the big door--connects to the far side of the Palace set and has nothing to do with actually entering the Palace. The result again is good for look and feel of the set head-on, but doesn't make much sense even as a playset. Similar deal with the Jabba's Prize set; Han-sicle is supposed to go on the side where Jabba can see him. In any case, my gripes are mostly about the price of the add-ons; otherwise I can live with the architecture.

Sparse Crowd:
Again, what you'd expect for a lego set, but still, Jabba's Palace was packed! When all the pieces are there, Jabba's gang is just Bib, Boba Fett, and a Gammorean. It sort of works here because also not included are Han and Chewie, two main players in the movie; the lego set goes for a simpler plot--Luke saves the Princess (and their profit margin). 

Finally, my last gripe--No Salacious Crumb!
Do I need to describe how I would have reveled in the production of a minifigure of the legendary Kowakian Monkey-Lizard?
Yeah, probably.
Salacious Crumb is the impish thing about the size of a regular monkey that's laughing beside Jabba; it's the thing that busted 3P0's eye before getting zapped by R2.
Right now, I'm just using a regular Monkey fig from the Community Workers set. 

Which brings me to my last point, something good this time:
There's enough surface on this set to turn it into a real party with enough figs. I have mine decked out with some Tusken Raiders, extra bounty hunters, and even one of those old ninjas. There's enough customizing potential in this set that it works, and even just by itself, it's a decent buy for $30, if you're not as concerned with minifigs as I am.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-14T14:09:45Z","Nice figs, Background could be better.","The figs are great. Let's say that. The piece under the floor is not so great. it is a nice idea to make the room of the  evil droid but everyone who has seen this film (I think most of the lego starwars buyers ) knows there is the cave of the Rancor. So If you decide to make a Rancor than make also no underplace. Than you can make more nice figs for this set like the band, Chewie and Lando, and Oola for example, that is what the most ( I think) fans want not a couple of black large bricks with nothing interresting.

"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T16:56:04.793Z","Good playset, with pro's and con's - combine w/ other sets","This is a great set. It has Jabba, two levels, some rare droids. For more play fun you can combine the set with the other two 'Jabba' set. And yes, you can just click them together into one new set. But, hey, this is Lego. Don't just click them into one. Instead, get all your other bricks and build a new Jabba's Palace of your own which includes the three sets. On a grey base plate or so. With brown walls, several guards, and a big monster in the cellar. And of course, make a bigger door because that's just too small.
On the minus side: the Lego Jabba is all green, and as we all know from the films, the film Jabba is only in part green, but also yellowish and tan. A better looking Jabba would have improved the looks of the set significantly.

"Pegasi","2007-08-11T20:18:53.753Z","Yum Yum, Radioactive Frog ","I think lego actually did an okay job on this set. Although Jaba's pallace may be a lot smaller than it was in the movie, I think that it would have been hard to replicate the actual size of it without making the set cost about 3 times as much.
  I think that the main flaw would probably be the lack of minifugures, although you can get those fairly easily if you just buy the other two sets that are designed to go with it for an extra eight pounds.

My favorite part of this set is probably the B'omar Monk Droid. (is that right) I liked this droid particularly, not only because it provided me with my first katanas,but because it is pretty well designed, and looks as though it is one of the weird droids that seems to lurk deep within the corners of Jabba's palace.

However... it in no way resembles much of anything in the movie. The sled is the closest, but the overall look and feel doesnâ€™t remind me of anything seen. A few more figures might have touched it off as well, just to add to the illusion.

"AFOSL","2009-03-30T16:01:00.547Z","Great Playset, Excellent Minifigs!","Jabba's Palace is what I would describe as more of a playset rather than a model.  Of course, you say, Lego is a toy with a core demographic of people below the age of 14.
However, Lego does have an army of adult fans such as myself, who just can't resist the little bricks, and I did cartwheels when Lego bought licensing from Lucasfilm LTD and started to make Star Wars sets.  I buy them, build them and put them on display, regarding them more as model kits, even though they are toys.
So Jabba's Palace makes a nice static model, even though it has a fair amount of playability.
Construction is straightforward and poses very few, if any problems.  The kit is mostly based on Jabba's main audience chamber, despite the name, and features Jabba's sliding throne, complete with frogs in sauce and a hubub, a dance floor and the trap door which falls away quit nicely when you slide back Jabba's throne.  To complete the picture a little more, the set contains a little 'workshop' for EV-9D9  to work, prepping Gonk droids and R2 units for toil wherever needed most.  The workshop is nothing more than a control panel brick in the basement section of the model, but without it EV-9 would be surplus to the set, not having anywhere to reside.  But I'd rather have her, than not, so that control panel is most welcome.
For a playset the construction is a little flimsy, being a two level affair held up by struts and plinths forming a box structure.  As a static model it's rigid enough. It's quite hollow, allowing little fingers to pull Luke out from the basement (Rancor pit) after falling through the trap door.
For finishing touches, the set has some nice flame elements all round, two flights of stairs, to give an authentic feel, and the front section of the model opens up revealing the basment level and allowing better access to it.
A fairly good selection of mini figures are included here, including the aforementioned EV-9, Luke Skywalker and Gonk Droid.
It is worth noting that Luke is supplied without gloved hands as per the movie, and also has a cape.  A hood would have been nice too, just to complete the look.
B'omarr Monk spider droid is included here, complete with brain in jar, and is quite a nice construction - technically not a mini figure.
The two best pieces are saved till last.  First up is Leia in slave outfit.  A somewhat daring piece for Lego, with all that yellow flesh on show.  She even has a chain around her neck to stop her running too far from Jabba's side.  Which leads me on to Jabba himself.  An excellent, faithful mold, requiring the construction of his tail and nothing more.  
A Jabba scene in Lego was a long time coming and is now available.  At the time of production, this set had a fairly reasonable price tag.  Expect a new in box set to fetch double it's original price today.
I give this set a 5/5 brick rating for the new and rare mini figures it provides and for Lego's first attempt at a Jabba scene, even if it isn't as faithful as some might hope for.  But don't forget, it's a playset first and foremost, not a serious model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-31T10:43:03.98Z","Jabba the Hut's Palace... Or Pizza the Hut's Castle","5 stars for cheesy title!
Starting rom the top level. You got a nice platform, but not much detail. Jabba sits on his higher platform with Leia who is strapped down with a chain. There are also green containers for Jabba's food (one of them has a frog in it). and there's a dome/lamp above Jabba. Really, that's all. As I said, there's not much. Now to the bottom. But how to get down there? Pull back on the platform Jabba sits on and the trap door drops down. But because it's only held up by an axel rod, you have to manually put it bck up.
Now we're at the bottom level. There's not much room in the Rancor pit, but the main part is the Droid torture room. Droids included are the red one (don't know the name), a Gonk droid, and a spider droid (not the ones from episodes 2-3). There's not much room inside when the bottom half is closed (yes, it can do that). But there is enough room when it's open. Also,there isn't much detail.
Overall, I still give it a 4/5. I's a good set, yes, but it's got gaps, and small spaces, and not much detail. There isn't much playability because it's a small-ish palace. Really only get it if you want to complete the collection, or if you truely want it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I wished the set could be bigger and have more minifgures like Bib Fortuna, a Gamorrean Guard or two.  I would love a section for Han frozen in carbonite, and maybe even a section for the Max Rebo Band on both sides of the trap door and throne.  The droid factory should have featured some droid torture mechanisms, like the burning device from the film which tortures the gonk droid.
