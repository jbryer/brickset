Theres only one down side its really hard to build.[I had trouble on it,because im not a very good Lego technic even though i have many big bionicles].The two wheels are Mad as to roll around. And under the vechile is a huge Blaster which can be launched by lifting a leaver up. If like Star wars ALOT get this set set its so cool. Worth the Money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-11T10:12:02Z","Awesome droid","This set is awesome.  Is is amazingly realistic(not counting the holes in most lego technic pieces).  I spent so much time playing with it.  But it lacks missle firing action.  This set would have been even cooler if lego had decided to make the hailfire droid fire missles.  All it does is raise it's guns at a push of a button.  Also the wheels don't spin as easily as they look like on the box.  Although there are so many downsides to this set, I rate it a 9/10 for being just for me.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T21:39:44Z","big boy on 2 whweel","This set is as Ryan said a big set. It's actually my brothers but he was only 11 and found most of the joining the technic peices hard so I did most of the building for him. While I was building it I noticed that it had no lego peices so I woundered why it was not named a technic set. Anyway I loved building this set as it was challenging and it is fun to play with and the wheels spin really well on carpet. 
Pluses:
* Spining wheels
* challenging to build
Minuses:
* Takes ages and missiles don't fire

This is a great set and it takes ages to build but it gets all paid off once you've finished and admire the work you have just done. It is fun to play with and the gun down at the bottem of it is really cool how it pops in and out. Also the missile pads are cool but it is a pitty the missiles don't fire. Overall a great set and fun to play with.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-29T14:41:36Z","One of the better ones","This is a sweet set. The interesting thing is the different type of lego pieces you don't normally see in Star Wars lego sets. I like the gun under the droid center and the rockets. The only thing bad was that it wasn't stable between the wheels and the center and it has a tendency to slide off if not held or picked up properly. Basically it is a good set to get.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T08:44:28Z","Hoop Wheels!","This set was much bigger than I thought it would be originally. The wheels are huge. It really rolls, but needs some traction, like a carpet. It takes a long time to build, and can get boring. Some technic pieces are very small, and may get lost.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-18T00:13:14Z","Hailfire Droid","This was my first and so far only Technic set in the Star Wars line. While the construction can get pretty boring, the end result is worth it. The set is a lot bigger than I anticipated and the wheels roll really well on carpet surfaces. If you see one I highly recomend picking one up!

Pros:
* Wheels really role
* Awesome missile design
* Very Sturdy

Cons:
* Building can get a bit boring and tiresome",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Vorahk1Panrahk2","2007-03-24T12:12:25.073Z","One Nice Set","The Hailfire Droid is defiantly going down as one of my favorite Star Wars sets. Here's why:

The Box front displays the above image of the Hailfire Droid charging into battle. The back of the box displays some of the functions, like the popping out bottom gun, and the rolling wheels. 

There are some really nice pieces for this set. One of the pieces that really stands out are, yes, you guessed it, those giant dark gray wheels. Yes, they probably can't be used for much else, but they really make the set what it is. Other pieces that stand out are the black gear pieces, and those really long brown pieces that you can see under Lewa's Katana in the image. 

In pretty much all my reviews so far, I said the build for the set is pretty simple and straightforward. I won't lie and say that here, because it's not. The build is fairly complex, and sometimes I got so frustrated I didn't want to work any more on the model! Fortunately, perseverance won out, and I finished the model despite almost breaking a piece or two. Maybe three. Actually I think I did break one by accident. :P

Once your finished with the model, you have two options. One of them is to wheel it around and pretend to shoot invisible bad guys with it. However, it must be said that the Hailfire Droid, due to its size and complexity, is much better off as a display item. 

There is one flaw with this set, and that is the lower gun deployment which is controlled by a rubber band. The rubber band has since worn out, and so the gun is stuck in the out position. This probably will happen with the majority of the models. 

This set is nicely detailed, and every part is used to increase the awesomeness of the model. Great design (both with the wheels and with the missile part combined with a great display earns the set a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But There is a new one coming out in 2008 that comes with a spider doid, and a few super an regular battle droids(Geonosian I think)I cant WAIT!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Manxboi24","2007-09-26T18:20:37.39Z","Great Set","I got this on ebay recently for only $20! And then I waited and waited until finally it arrived! It is really great although it is a little confusing to build. And it is massive! The best bit about it is that you can push it around as the wheel really roll.
Unfortunately, almost every set also has a downside. This one doesn't have any minifigs. But oh well.

Pros:
Massive
Rolling wheels 
Accurate
Cool missile launchers

Cons:
No minifigs
Confusing to build

Overall - a great set

The build is pretty hard to do! It's confusing! Anyway the wheels are awesome! There 8 inches wide! I like the use of borahk shields and lewa swords. The rocket pods are cool!

"Da_LegoBuilder","2008-03-28T20:52:16.153Z","This is so better than the new one!","Why waste $20 on the new one than this one? This set is in proportion,strudy, and detailed!

I had my instruction booklet on standby, and dropped this set off of my bunkbed! and guess what? it survived! Nothing fell off, unlike the new set, it keeps on breaking! This set even amused my little sister a long time ago...

The detail is magnificent! Same # of missles in the movie, unlike the 8 missles in the new one! And flicking missles? whats up with that? 

This set is proportion with the minifig, perfect! The new one is so small! In the movie, this took out a AT-TE (All Terrain Tactical Enforcer if you were wondering) in just one shot! How could something so small like the new hailfire droid do that?!

Lastly, this thing works! Too hard to describe it, blows that average collector away. This set is probably that best Technic set ever produced!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It also has a lot of cool and fun features including the big, awsome wheels and that flickable gun on the bottom of it. Plus it comes with interesting peices.

The features are amazing. There's a pull out gun and lots of missles. This can crush any vehicle or mini figure you want. A great set to play with or battle with your other legos. 5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-01T11:09:59.873Z","Perfect for Technic and Star Wars fans.","This set is spectacular. The detail, the size, the accurracy! It all is so perfect. I really, don't know where to start. How 'bout the wheels?
Wheels- Very interesting. The main part of the wheel isn't really connected to anything. It just sits there with some pis in the groove to keep it in place. It's very bulky and has great detail on the outside. But the side facing the middle is a little hollow. Both wheels are built the same, but are mirrored. It rolls very nicely and smoothly, and I think on any surface, but I'm not sure. (I don't have the set with me. It's in the basement, and I didn't fish it out, so I can't be sure.)
Middle/Body- One again great detail. I think in the movie, though, this thing had 3 eyes, But this only has one visible eye. It does have 2 others, but they're so deep in the armor that you can't see them (I think they're in the gap in front of Lewa's Air Katana). The missles are nicely built, but they don't fire. It'd be cool if they could, but they don't. It does have a function, though. The under-carrige gun can swing out by pushing the back of it, but that's all it has to offer.  
Really, that's all. Because it's Technic, it holds together well. I don't think there ever has been an incident when anything fell off. Overall, a great set. If you enjoy Technic models, get it. If you like Star Wars, get. Highly reccomended.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

But its parts are very good and very useful. It's very interesting to move it with these big wheels and it also has a gun at the bottom. Also, the construction is very strong.",FALSE,4,5,4,4,4
"FlagsNZ","2015-06-18T09:16:46.177Z","This Iconic set is packed full of rare parts in rare colours","<p>I have been on the lookout for this set for some time. I saw it recently on eBay with a very reasonable <em>Buy Now</em> option so I seized the opportunity.</p>

<p>The Hailfire&nbsp;droid&nbsp;was a mobile guided missile tank that destroyed enemy vehicles and platoons of enemy soldiers. The distinctive large hoop wheels enabled the droid&nbsp;to operate on any terrain.</p>

<p>The Hailfire&nbsp;droid&nbsp;was equipped with two rocket magazines with 15 guided missiles each. There was also a retractable cannon under the armoured command module.</p>

<p>The Hailfire&nbsp;droid was seen in Star Wars Episode 2 during the Battle of Geonosis.</p>

<p>The large wheels gave the droid its mobility.&nbsp;I have wanted a pair of these distinctive big wheels to be used in several MOCs that I have planned.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5448/18291781183_36aeda4dc0_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set was advertised on eBay without the box or instructions and with some parts missing. This is probably why it was available for such a reasonable price and had not been snatched up earlier. I was primarily interested in obtaining the big wheels.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that instructions are available online.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>107 (15%) of the 681 parts have been in five sets or less. 71 (10%) of the parts are unique to this set. The uniqueness is because this is the only set that has a selection of Technic parts in&nbsp;Earth-Ora and Silver colours.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/520/18912407875_52e8e8dc68_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>While this set has been listed under the Star Wars theme, it could quite easily be called a Technic set as every part comes from the Technic range.</p>

<p>The premier part is the <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/x784"">Hailfire droid wheel</a>. With a diameter of 26 studs and a width of three studs, it is the largest&nbsp;<em>Technic</em>&nbsp;gear. There are 168 teeth on the inner ring.</p>

<p>It is possible to place 41 <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4119224"">balls</a>&nbsp;in the groove and make a massive ball bearing that is capable of supporting huge loads.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/446/18289882124_6918d2f5f1_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5443/18886132526_9403fc4984_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>These parts have only ever appeared in this set and are highly&nbsp;sought after.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Hailfire droid was a self-aware mobile missile platform that operated autonomously. A&nbsp;Minifigure driver is&nbsp;not required.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There is some very clever geometry it the chassis of this droid.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/358/18915292001_b06f70e46f_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The two wheels are supported&nbsp;by a couple of pins and two cogs on each of the four bogies.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5532/18724756428_7281fc4b69_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The only parts that are still not on this set are the six <a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/32201"">Hose Soft Axles</a>. I have been able to fill all the missing parts with light grey in lieu of the silver variants.</p>

<p>There is a spring loaded cannon slung under the chassis which can be released and deployed&nbsp;&nbsp;using a trigger.</p>

<p>The wheels have a significant positive <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camber_angle"">camber</a>. Despite the complex geometry and construction that supports the wheels, this set drives around easily.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am glad I have acquired this set although this was principally for the parts on offer.&nbsp;I managed to get the whole set (albeit missing a few parts and no manual or box) for the same price as just the two wheels as advertised at <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/search.asp?q=x784"">Bricklink</a>.</p>

<p>I am going to use the two wheels in a range of MOCs. They may be used as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slewing_bearing"">slew bearing</a> for a crane MOC using the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42042-1/Crawler-Crane"">42042 Crawler Crane</a>&nbsp;as the inspiration.</p>

<p>Having seen the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21303-1/WALL%E2%80%A2E"">21303 Wall&bull;E&nbsp;Ideas set</a>, I have thought about making a similar model using <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Mindstorms/subtheme-EV3"">Mindstorms</a>. Seeing these two wheels up close, I thought a Mindstorms <a href=""http://www.segway.com/"">Segway</a>&nbsp;may be a possibility.</p>

<p>Finally, I have looked at the outer ring of teeth on these two wheels and believe I could make a chain using <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4114634"">Technic 6M Half Beams</a>. I have wanted to make a working Technic clock and perhaps I could use weights to power the mechanism.</p>
