"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-13T12:44:27Z","Impressive bug","This is a great set and cannot fail to impress if only for its sheer size and the fact that it looks like a huge bug. It is difficult to get shots from the movie to look at for comparison as they appear in fairly short sequences, but it does seem to look like what it is supposed to. I think however that the main cannon on top should be capable of being elevated whereas on the model it can only rotate. I am also not convinced that a Clone Trooper should be sitting exposed outside on a seat operating the cannon. It looks not only improbable, but of scale, and detracts from the appearance. Construction is fairly easy using the new hinges for the legs. A similar post and wedge arrangement to the AT - AT head has been used to secure the side armour plates at the correct angle. These tend to get knocked and spring out of place easily. Top is also a loose fit &quot;lid&quot; arrangement and can be removed to reveal 2 more more troopers inside and there is also a speeder bike which can be stowed in the rear (again like the AT - AT). Stickers have to be used to create the correct cockpit profile (containing trooper) and the details on the top - printed would have been preferred. One minor oddity, blue bricks are included for the underside at both ends whereas the box art shows grey which look much better so i have substituted grey. Although there are some minor niggles I rate this as a 10 because it will impress anyone who sees it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-12T14:11:42Z","great set","Ok folks,

I got this set three days ago. I kinda fell in love with the troopers and the speeder and just the fact that it has 630 bricks to assemble.

I was pleased to find a lot of bricks I didn't even kno to exist. Th stormies look AWESOME, the speeder is cool and basicly, this set is worth the money, so I won't tell you why to buy it, I'd rather explain what I disliked ('cause there's always something that you don't like, ecspecialy with lego star wars models).

Well the general bug aspect looks weird, but for this, you'd better complaint o George Lucas anyway, so basicly 

-the canon should have some kind of cockpit to protect the guy who's shooting
-the cockpit has not a single steeringwheel, so tell me how you should drive this thing?
-the decals suck, I just hate decals, you never manage to put them correctly.
-lego could have added at 3 more stormies. You can place 4 inside the at-te, 1 driver, 1 canon shooter and 1 speeder biker.
-The round...cannons, at the front and back are not the best you can find...
-Forget about playing with it. Just like the AT-AT, you should rather expose this model than letting children play with it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I got it for Christmas last year, and found it most entertaining to build and play with. Of course, I never had any Clone Troopers until then, so this was also a boon to my collection. I would not recommend trying to get it to &quot;walk&quot; like the AT-AT, but posing is fine. The storage for the troopers and speeder, plus the little area for tools makes the set have character, and I like that. What I do not like is that the ball turrets tend to get hard to turn after the newness wears out. Plus, one must always be very, very, VERY careful when appyling decals!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T16:02:05Z","those damn legs...?","well where do i start? i mean this set has many many good things but there is also some flaws... i got this set about two years ago and yes it is empressive it took me some time to assemble it but after about two hours it was finish finally.. but after two minnutes the two front legs fell of DAMN MAN ALREADY. but thats just one thing the thing is to flat in the movie it stands taller..? i mean the clones walk under it ind the legs are higher it looks like a turtle with six legs?. .. but you should really buy this set its great and you get CLONES i mean clones they are just so cool and you get a speeder its the same like the one in ewok attack just red. and almost all the bricks are rare. this set deserves a big 8 (not 10 because of the legs as i told)great to play with just remember pretend that it walks or else you will find your self fighting a war with it instead of the thing fighting against other legos...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-01T20:42:47Z","awsome the AT-TE is.","This set is incredibly awsome it looks right out of the movie i love the speeder bike but it gives you 4 back seats when there is only 2 clone troopers to sit in the back 4 seats this set needed more clone troopers and then it would be a perfect set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Cashcleaner","2007-02-23T23:35:34.81Z","Far from perfect","At first glance, this set looks like one of the best ever created for the Star Wars line of LEGO kits, however looks can be deceiving.  In my opinon, the biggest error is the placement of the top laser turret and clone gunner.  The actual weapon is mounted further back on the main body of the vehicle and not on top of the cockpit.  Another complaint is with LEGO opting to use stickers instead of printed elements, as pointed out in a previous review.  Lastly, some overall dimensional errors detract from the charm of the orginal model, but I will concede that most people wouldn't be bothered by this issue.

All said, it is still an impressive model and displays nicely.  The speeder bike included is a nice touch, and I don't have a problem with the amount of Clone Troopers included with the kit.  When all is said and down, it's an average kit that loses points for the high price and technical errors.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-23T18:51:10.233Z","Better than the New One","I think this one is better because you get more clones, moving turret, and good armor. However, the legs are terrible, but everyone says that. The speeder bike is pretty good too. 5 out of 5 for a good original set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set is..well..expensive, look at these on ebay! They sell for over $200! and wait for the new one, only $90! The speeder looks really good with this set, and 4 clones makes it a army builder!
What fustrated me the most was that i know someone who got MOST of the insructions! so he had this 1/2 assembled AT-TE waiting to be played with for 2 wks!

It is movie accurate, but watch out for decals! Don;t like those...

I love the fact that it has 6 legs, not to mention that you get 4 Troopers with it. My only complaint is that the legs don't move to well, and can fall apart if you try to move them to much, so it's more of a display model.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-02T17:58:03.64Z","Armored Cockroach of the Clone Army","This set is great and is one of my favorites. The overall bulk of the machine is deceptive as it is pretty much hollow. The speeder bike is a nice touch, though it never appeared in the movie from my knowledge. The legs are bad. This set is mainly for display. You can't move the legs to make it crawl. If they made it so they could swing out, that'd be nice. 
The cockpit is very nice. It even has a sliding out seat for easier access to the pilot. The cannon on top can only swivel and can't be pointed upward. But the spherical guns make up for that as they can be pointed anywhere. 
The middel can stor supplies, 4 guns and 4 clones. The back of the middel stores the speeder bike which can be accessed by a door in the back which also has 2 more shperical guns.
The End.

"RCT3Dude96","2011-02-24T00:18:57.54Z","An awesome set that still beams today.","Even though I have a soft spot for this set because it was my very first Lego set, I'll try to be fair in reviewing. First off, it's a very fun build with a complex, yet useful structure. There are many cool parts, like the leg joints, as well as the circular guns. Now, playability was tough. Even though it included a speeder bike and four minifigures, this set isn't the best at playability. All the figures are the same, the legs can barely move, and they are also fragile because they are poorly attached to the joints. Despite this lag, the value I think is good. Perhaps it's a little overpriced at 70$ for around 650 pieces, but it's still worth buying because it looks so cool. Overall, this is a pretty good set, but it's not worth buying for playing.<br>",TRUE,4,5,5,3,5
"LegoCollector125","2011-08-08T06:22:26.357Z","""These weapons of war would be awe-inspiring, if they were not so terrifying.""","<p>I had been trying to get an AT-TE for some time when I finally got my hands on one last year. I was quite impressed by the set as a display piece, but looking closer, there are some important flaws. </p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The sets box in quite intersting. It is designed so that it opens like the boxes that had display flaps, but it simply opens right to the inner box, with no display. The instructions differentiate colors well, as usual. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The set does have some nice printed pieces that are fairly rare, as well as lots of gray bricks and technic connections. There is also some nice dark red thrown in for good measure. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The Episode II style Clones found in the set are a nice figure to have, and look great. The problem is, that's all that there is. The set should have included at least a few battle droids to increase playability. More on that later. </p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>It is always interesting to build tanks like this and see how LEGO attaches the outer plating. In this case, it is done well, and is quite sturdy. Otherwise, there are a few other intersting methods used in the build, and it is enjoyable. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The completed AT-TE looks great as a display piece, but is extremely unstable in the legs. If you put pressure on it, or try to&nbsp;move the feet, the legs are likely to collapse due to the poor connections. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, the original AT-TE, while not without it's flaws, is a great display piece. The set looks better armored an overall nicer compared to the new one, but if you are looking for playability, I certainly recommend the version from 2008. This set is a nice addition to any collection, especially for a Star Wars fan, just don't&nbsp;expect your going to be moving it around very much!</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,2,4
"alfred_the_buttler","2020-12-09T09:13:26.387Z","Great Display Piece, So Long as Your Home Isn’t Prone to Earthquakes!","<p>I got this set a couple of years ago but never reviewed it. I of course built it when I got it and then constantly repaired it over the past few years, but then my kids found it, and not that it&#39;s their fault, but it was beyond repair and just needed to get rebuilt, which it would have benefited from even before they played with it. To say this set is fragile would be the understatement of the millennium! But if you want a display piece, this set does fit the bill, although gravity will take a toll on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<p>The instruction book is printed on high quality paper and is old school in that it doesn&#39;t show you which parts you need or even highlight where each part goes. This is how instructions were when I was a kid so I really enjoy them.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>All you get with this set is 4 standard clones, not even a unique driver. Certainly the clones make sense and are nice to have, but I would have at least liked a unique driver, and of course a Jedi would have been very welcome as well. As it is, it&#39;s alright, but certainly not a great minifigure selection.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The&nbsp;great thing about these older sets is you get&nbsp;a lot of large, and very few small parts. I imagine that if Lego were to redesign this set today it would have double the part count. That said the set doesn&#39;t really lack any detail, what it lacks is structure. As for the parts it has these large ball joints that I&#39;ve only ever seen in older Star Wars sets, and beyond that a lot of large plates and technic hinge joints. It also has some very nice printed radar dishes, but then has several stickers as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps in its day this build was revolutionary, but today it isn&#39;t all that exciting. If you&#39;ve ever built any set that relies on panels, then you pretty much know how this set works. It took me about 2 hours to completely break it down and rebuild it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You start out building the base which is completely devoid of technic, yet has a layer of plates then bricks and then plates which gives it a modestly strong foundation. A modern set would have integrated technic into the brick layer to make it indestructible which might be a worthwhile modification if it weren&#39;t for the more serious structural problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After building the base you progressively build up the model in a linear fashion. The build is very open and thin yet stays together decently. Again there is absolutely no technic and no SNOT, save for the angled bricks that the legs will get attached too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the entire upper part is completed you assemble the legs. The two middle legs are identical, and the 4 outer legs are identical as well. Unfortunately, the legs are the weakest part of the model, just looking at them can cause them to fall apart. I highly recommend building all 6 legs and then holding the model in the air as you attach all of them as they will certainly break if you add them one at a time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally it is time to add the side panels, which are not only impossibly thin, but attach to the model with a single technic pin and loosely stay in place thanks to a couple of sloped bricks. All 4 panels are identical, although two are mirrored.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last thing you do is build the speeder bike. These older designs aren&#39;t as sleek as the Endor speeders that would come out 5 years later, and they feature a brick built seat, yet it isn&#39;t bad. Sure it&#39;s bulky, but given what was available at the time, I feel Lego did an excellent job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>The model does look great, there is no question it is an AT-TE and it looks appropriately scaled next to my Clone Turbo Tanks. It even has some play features. You can pull out a group of 4 seats that are used to transport clones. The windshield folds down and you can slide out the cockpit in order to put in / remove the driver. Plus the speeder fits into a garage in the back. Not to mention the large cannon on top that swings around and all the blasters on ball joints that can be aimed in any direction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, this sets downfall is in its lack of strength. The legs in particular fall apart in several locations. The inverse tiles with pins that attach to the &quot;knee&quot; joints can easily fall off the legs, as can all of the toes that receive no reinforcement and simply attach with two studs. The later can be easily remedied by placing plates beneath the foot and toes, kind of like horse shoes. However the connection at the knees would require a total redesign, which would be quite the challenge given that the legs are a single plate with a few decorative elements on top. To throw in a technic beam would make the legs seem incredibly thick, although it&#39;s probably worth doing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t just large legs that are problematic. With their single pin connection and thin builds, the panels come off very easily. The removable top also just sits on tiles, there isn&#39;t a single stud to hold it in place, and the long sloped bricks are only attached by a single stud on the bottom and top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>The model looks great, which is what makes it somewhat worthwhile. I certainly give Lego credit for designing a good looking model with some pretty difficult geometries at this time.&nbsp;However it has a disappointing minifigure collection and is just way too fragile. Just picking it up to place on a shelf or in a box will probably require it to get some repairs, and just leaving it alone, gravity will eventually knock off the legs. Until I can figure out how to reinforce it&#39;s legs, it simply isn&#39;t a set that I will ever be able to play with,&nbsp;and there is no way the kids could ever enjoy it. I just feel that Lego wasn&#39;t yet ready to build a set with such difficult geometries at this time. This is&nbsp;easily the most fragile Lego set I&#39;ve ever built.&nbsp;It&#39;s hard for me to recommend this set, unless you can find it for an absolute bargain. I don&#39;t have any of the newer AT-TE&#39;s, but they have to be much better than this.&nbsp;</p>
