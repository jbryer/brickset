"A_Brickset_user","2003-01-05T00:00:00Z","","I was so VERY afraid LEGO would only give us a UCS version of this one, that I felt a great relief when I saw the first (very small) pictures online.  And the best thing about this: It is remarkably spot-on!!  I was afraid that LEGO would mess up the head as they did with the AT-ST, but no, it's a beauty!

However, I must say that from first sight it comes with an unsufficient amount of minifigs.  Four minifigs for such a big set?  Come on, LEGO could do better than that.  However, the pictures we have seen are prototype pics, and so I hope that LEGO will throw in some more snowtroopers (I think 4 snowtroopers is a minimum for this set), another driver and of course admiral Veers.  Look at the cockpit, it should have no problem stocking three figures...

All in all THE masterpiece to date, and I'll buy one the minute it hits the stores for sure!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-30T00:00:00Z","","The Imperial AT-AT is one of the quintessential icons of the Star Wars universe. The 4 legged behemoth has now made its impact felt in the world of Lego. With over 1,000 pieces this set will take a good amount of time to build. After building it myself I have to say that the model has taken the throne within my collection. The legs work well here, much better than the AT-TE, in that I can create a pose without having pieces coming off. The legs support the weight of the model well with the wide ""feet"". The upper section looks good and the paneling moves well to allow for access inside. The speeder bike fits snugly. The model is easily handled from the undercarriage without losing any pieces. The head section is connected by one piece and can move horizontally. It may seem a bit wobbly at first but when compared to the movie it seems appropriate to me(check out the range of motion when the AT-AT shoot the snowspeeder at short range). The opens up to reveal the cockpit. This should have had room for two, but that would have required a larger, wider model. The guns look good and allow for a large range of forward firing within a 120 degree arc. General Veers should have been included. The snow troopers look good, but 4 should have been included instead of 2. Hoth Luke hanging is a nice touch. All in all this is a great set and will certainly showcase well in any collection or battle scene diorama. Enjoy!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-14T10:59:41Z","A Fantastic Looking Set!","One of the most requested Lego sets, this set will not dissapoint you! A fairly good building experience (however, the legs get tedious) and as a system set, is payable and posable. With over 1,00 pcs, you get the AT AT, a snow speeder bike, 1 AT AT driver, 2 snowtroopers, and Luke in his rebel pilot uniform. There are two hidden compartments where your troopers can sit and a hidden storage area in the back of the AT AT for the snow speeder bike.

Te only downside is the head and the neck. As commented before, the head is not too sturdy and the neck is flimsy. However, with some minor modifications these can be fixed.

Overall, Lego has hit another homerun with this set and I would recommend this set to any Lego fan!

Received the AT-AT for Xmas 2003 present.. Assembly was straight forward, no mistakes or confusing diagrams in instruction book as far as I can tell. 160 minutes from start to finish for 1063 pcs...

Method of closure for control pod/cockpit side doors is lame, and very substandard even for Lego design. Post and wedge? I think not.. The side doors pop open just by looking at them.

Now, as for proper scale, this leaves a little to be desired: The control pod/cockpit, if I remember from Empire Strikes Back (Episode 5) holds 3 Imperial personnel: Driver, Co-Driver, Commander/Gunner. Model only provides room for 1. I will purchase additional mini figs, and redesign interior to more closely reflect interior as shown on screen, and redesign latch mechanism for side doors.

I don't recall getting a close look inside the AT-AT in the movies, so no comment on the troop storage or snowbike in the main body. Other than that, this model now sits on my top shelf proudly displayed.

"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-27T12:05:17Z","what's up with the head?","The mini-figs are awesome, the body is cool, but for $100  Lego should have done the head better.  The cool thing about Lego is you can modify them and I highly recomend that you do.  The 2 sides of the head constantly swivel open leaving the driver exposed to the elements.  Forget trying to take these down with Snowspeeders or tow cabels.  The rebels simply need to shoot the driver since both sides of the cockpit constantly fly open!  If that doesn't work, the AT-AT will destroy itself since the head is barely attached by a thread, it doesn't take much for the head to fall off!

I don't give this a 10 just because of the head.  you almost can't play with it too hard, or it breaks.  With some quick modifications you can fix most problems though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-31T12:08:19Z","Cool","Now THIS is cool lego set! I have one of these, and I love it. The bad thing about it is the size. It's too small! I was trying to play it with my rebel snowspeeder, and..uh-oh, no good. But minifigs are soooo cool! But I think lego made a BIG mistake with putting Luke to this set. It's better if they didn't put Luke Skywalker into set, and they put 1 or 2 more snowtroopers to the set. But, I must say this, This is SO COOL!!!!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-11T18:49:46Z","Best Star Wars Set EVER!!!!!!!!!!!","When I first say this set in April, I knew I would just have to get it.  I had to wait about 4 months before I could get it though(it was worth the wait).  I love the design to make the AT-AT's armor.  Almost each armor plate can move in a certain way.  It was the one of my favortite sets.  I just couldn't leave it alone.  The minifigures were awesome except for Luke.  Don't get me wrong, Luke is a cool figure but I already have about 4.  I have heard many people comment about how easily the side of the cockpit swings open easily but mine doesn't do that as often as they describe(maybe mine is special ^-^).  I, however, have to agree that the head falls off too easily.  Sometimes your playing with it and head falls off smashing into a bajillion pieces.  Of course I have learned to tighten it every now and then.  I like how the seats that the snowtroopers sit on are mobile.  I just wish they would give 2 more troopers in the set to occupy all the seats.  I also like the speeder bike.  I think there should have been a entrance to the cockpit too.  This set is really inaccurate but loads of fun.  How is it inaccurate you might ask?

1. The cockpit is supposed to hold 3 people with much room left.

2. Bottom shouldn't have a hole that leads directly into the AT-AT. 

3. Luke attaches the string to his belt, he doesn't hold it.

4. The AT-AT is supposed to hold about 40 troopers.

5. Plates don't really shift.  

6. The inside of an AT-AT isn't blue, red, and yellow.

    Sorry kind of got carried away.  Anyways, I give this set a 10/10 out of ten for being playable, having rare minifigures, having many features, and being just for me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T16:44:07Z","Fantastic, except for the head","Well, I can only echo the sentiments of my predecessors.  After reading some of the comments on the 'net, it took me a while to convince myself to shell out for this set, but I'm glad I did.

The head construction is a bit disappointing, but if you tilt the side flaps inwards as much as possible, you can prevent them from swinging open too often.  

The AT-AT construction is very cool, with the two opening sides and room for the speeder bike inside the structure.  When I was putting the on the flat pieces that the bike sits on I recall thinking to myself - &quot;I wonder what they're for.&quot;  Very impressive.

The bike itself is the same design as the one in Ewok Attack, for those that can't tell from the photo.

We didn't really need another Luke, but the two snow troopers almost make this one worthwhile on their own.

With this set you get two snowtroopers which look really cool, An AT-AT driver which has a great deataled helmet, and of course Luke in a reble uniform. The rope that dangles under the engine is a nice touch. The side panels open up, and inside are two seats so that the troopers can be transporeted around. The back opens and inside is a white speeder bike. The head looks sooooooooooo cool. but the side parts of the head open up easy, but it can be easily fixed. To start of with the legs may not bend or move that easy at the start. But if you play around with it as much as i do, problem solved. I recomened this set to ALL star wars collectors.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-13T08:41:28Z","Great Imperial Walker","This is my favourite lego set and i have given it pride of place. It is large, impressive and fairly accurate. It goes together fairly well. I did not find the neck joint too bad, but agree that the method of keeping the sides of the head in place is less than satisfactory - i (like just about everyone else it seems) have modified mine. I also feel the use of light and dark Grey bricks detracts from the overall appearance - it should be light grey overall. I have replaced virtually all the dark grey bricks on the head with the light grey equivalent. I have also made other modifications to get this looking like more like the one in the movie. I felt the head as it comes is a little too large in proportion to the body and this tends to make it look like a &quot;baby&quot; At -At. Sliming down the head and making the chin cannon project further forward (like in the movie) does a lot to restore the correct proportions and give an &quot;adult&quot; appearance. There are several alternatives/variations for heads on the Brickshelf site. The body is fine provided that the coloured bricks cannot be seen poking out from underneath and some of these have also been replaced.  Legs fine but again all light grey would be better. It is not minifig scale, but  snowtroopers and driver inside cannot be seen, so do not detract. However, Luke is flying my X-wing which is much more in proportion. Despite the criticisms and modifications this is a very impressive model and is still a 10 as it comes - mods just make it 11.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-14T06:40:23Z","a few flaws","Pros: 
This is probably the closest I will ever get to a lego mech, me having little skill in building legs.
Great mini-figs
Good access to the inside
Very tall(obviously)
Nice selection of radar dishes
Good printed pieces
Fairly easy to build
SNOWTROOPERS!!!
Cons:
Too many plates with no studs used on the top and sides
Cockpit falls open easily
No-one needs another Luke. Another snowtrooper or Hoth trooper would have been better.

By the way, I used mine as a metal gear, and had my mini-fig Ocelot kick Raiden's butt on top of it, but that's another story entirely...

"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-05T06:40:33Z","Best Minfig Star Wars set out there!","Not counting the Ultimate collector sets of course... But I enjoyed building this set more than any other set before it. My brother and I bought one for each of us and raced while building. 2 hours 20 minutes baby!!! Granted I've been legoing it up for over 20 years now. But I was shaking uncontrolably when I was finally finished. (that and my punk little bro never truly finished his properly)

When finished this thing looks PERFECT! The body legs and head all look awesomely proportional to each other, and walker shares a beautiful resemblence to the one in the movie. Where as all the other sets look kind of stubby and child-friendly. (Leaving realism to the Ultimate Collector models. I like how the troopers are set in removeable seat platforms in the main body, and between the platforms the speeder bike nestles perfectly. It took one heck of a designer to think up that arrangement, and I salute him.
The legs are also impressive, although limited in mobility.
However, the legs didn't move much in the movie either. I didn't really expect lego to go all out and throw in two thick joints per leg, let alone design the legs to be as sturdy as they are.

The Head Sucks. But don't get me wrong. just looking at it, it's perfect, and the sides are angled perfectly. but simply tapping it to turn the head, makes the side panels flop wide open. Plus anything more than a tap makes the panels fall off, or the head to completely fall off. This is a play set, not a Ultimate Collector display set. I wanted to attack a cardboard echo base not spend every other five minutes making repairs. Err... not that I um did that, I'm an adult... working full time... uh, drinking beer and partying on weekends... never mind.

Only other complaint I have is I wish it would have come with a few more troopers. Just so I could have a full cargo hold. AT-AT does stand for All Terrain Armored TRANSPORT.

In closing this set is awesome. I'd give it a nine but its so big and beautiful to look at. Plus it was just too much fun to build. I could only wish Lego would release a four foot Ultimate Collector AT-AT, because that would be the only way they could top this set.

It has enough pieces that combined with the new Millenium Falcon, should be able to create a massive spaceship or something. The AT-AT suffers from a weak neck, but that is easily overlooked once you see the rest of the set. The guns on the head were made very origninally(using lightsaber handles and wrenches) and the back and underside of the model are very accurate to the film models. The only oddity on this set is the mismactching of panelling on the sides and on the very top of the walker. It does not seem symmetrical. It does not matter. This is Ia set I will reach for time and time again and will never part with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-25T11:22:15Z","Impressive But a Few Design Flaws","First, let me say that the design of this model is excellent. It must take Lego designers months to develop models such as these and me, nearly four hours to build correctly. Nice job. I find the legs and core body structure nicely designed as well as sturdy. I like the leg design most and they are moveable without breaking. The side body plates aren't too bad, but can break off rather easily.

The worst part of the model is the head which only connects to the main body by a single black rod. This definately could have been better designed with maybe four black Technic pins that attach to the main structure. And then there's the issue with the side panels of the head which only attach by a single blue moveable round tile? Do the panels need to open? The top lifts nicely to insert/remove the pilot. The only thing that I can think is that the designers wanted to have a head that can explode open for playability?

I like the look of the upper sides and mid-section of the body but find the mini-fig compartment too small and awkward with the pull-out snow trooper seats that look more like thrones with an airplane tail in the midddle? Interesting concept to say the least.

I love the SnowTroopers and the pilot. Nice figs. For such a large set, however, a few more figs (like the Falcon)and a cannon or probe droid would have added to the set. Also, a longer cable for Luke to swing on would have been better. The speeder bike in white doesn't do much for me.

I do like this model (esp. at a sale price). The set is probably a Star Wars's enthusiast's best model to recreate the battle of Hoth. How I would have esp. enjoyed this in the early 80s!

In any case, I think this is a beautiful set but mainly; the head could have been better designed (I'm knocking 1 point off for this). Still a lot of fun and an excellent model.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's very challenging to build, altough modular and has a whopping 1065pcs, which is the biggest piece count at LEGO Minifig-scale sets. Altough it's a little bit overpriced in Germany it's surely great. Too sad, that it's sold out now. (Luckily my parents snagged one before Christmas and gave it to me just now)
Well the Model has just an awesome look. After almost 6 Hours of building it's done. There are many features, altough the Legs can't be moved very good. But heck about that it's a huge set with tons of Pieces and just rather compact in terms of space. 
Now on to the features: 
The Back has room for a hoth speeder bike and there's room for up to 4 Snow Troopers in it's indoor area, so 2 extra snowtroopers would've been better. The head is rather fragile, but when played carefully it doesn't fall off too easy. The legs can be moved, but only slowly, well in the movies it's moving slow, too.

First of all: Not to scale. There should be room for 2 pilots in the head, but it can only hold one. But it's Lego, we can only ask for so much.
This is great. As with all my Star Wars sets, it's packed away, so I don't remember all of what it has in store (but doesn't everyone like surprises?). The head has great detail. The guns are very nice in detail. As I said before, the cockpit can only store one passenger/pilot. There is also no window, but painted on a brick is a black line which acts as a window.
The body: As I said, I don't remember much about the set. I know it comes with a snowspeeder which stores in the back of the body. I also think you can store Snowtroopers in the body (very similar to the Ep. 2 AT-TE). It also has it's incredibly long legs, which, if I remember, are hard to position and have all feet on the ground. But I'm not sure.
One more thing- Careful with the head. Mine falls off easily, and that probably will happen to all of them.
Overall a great set. Very good detail. I highly recommend getting it. So get it already!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Once I had it, it proved to have a number of pros and cons. The main pro is that it is very close to the film prop in proportions, unlike the more recent motorized version. The main drawback as previous reviewers have stated, is the head. Though it was designed to look accurate, the construction wasn't well designed. The method of holding the side panels in place has since been replicated with the AT-AP. They easily fall off. The neck is also weak, though this is only exposed when force is applied to the head.

Looks very realistic

"Techman","2012-06-16T21:17:36.797Z","Old, Awesome, Great display model","I picked this kit up years ago when its release was made. I remember buying it in a target retail store. The box was banged up bad so the price was cut a little. The size of the box was quite large which I no longer have. The booklet was thick and the four legs were tedious to build and got tiresome. Since I was young when I got this the hardest part were the feet of the legs. The booklet was a bit unclear so I had help in assembling this monster. The features of this set are awesome. It is a huge model to display with. The sides open up and a cart that holds troops can slide in and out of the side. The back opens up to reveal a snow speeder which seems odd, but served a great play feature. The only real issue I had as a complaint was the head which was connected by an axle. My head, when used a lot came off and turning it side to side was limited by its rotation. I knew not to be too rough on the head. Thankfully, in the old days, stickers weren't a problem like today. The windshield on the front of the walker was a cool piece. What's cool about the set is it's assembled in sections that snap together along the way. The largest part was the top section with all the panels that bent and angled to give a good profile of the set. The set came with two snow troopers which were cool to have and the pilot and Luke Skywalker. To sum up, this set is discontinued and hard to fine for a reasonable price, If you get the chance and have the cash to spare, what are you waiting for, go grab the kit before the price skyrockets more. It is a well designed set except for a few areas that could be fixed. It is really massive in height and is sturdy. The legs can pose in many ways to imitate walking and the classic feel from the movie.&nbsp;",FALSE,4,4,3,4,4

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2015-02-06T17:58:22.89Z","Lucky to have got this one, but Lego, would a rubber band have been too much to ask?","<p>I had the good fortune to receive this set for my birthday in 2004. I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes at first when I ripped off the wrapping paper. $100 Lego sets? That was something that happened to other, luckier people. I was very happy. It took me a while to get it built, but I was thrilled. I was also upset when due to my father&#39;s clumsiness it took a fall off the windowsill and smashed. And the instructions went missing soon after my birthday; I think my mother carelessly threw them out when cleaning (I swear, tidiness-obsessed parents have to be the inspiration for the Bohrok and Bahrag from Bionicle. &quot;Clean it all it must be cleaned&quot;). After that fall, the set was broken up for parts and remained parted out for a decade and change. But this January, I finally decided &quot;Screw it, I&#39;m rebuilding the bastard no matter how much of a pain it is and what I have to retrieve the parts from.&quot;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is standard 2002-2003 Star Wars packaging, with the set pictured sticking out of a cut-off circle justified on the bottom-right corner. It&#39;s also big, as one would expect with a big set. The instructions are quite clear. They have a nice but nondistracting starry background, and piece callouts. However, there is one instance of the instructions telling you to do something well before you actually should, which causes problems later.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Almost all of the parts are gray or dark gray. Not the most exciting color scheme, but the AT-AT walkers <em>are</em> giant masses of gray so it&#39;s quite appropriate. Lots and lots of plates and tiles, because the walker is a hollow box on bl<span class=""rangySelectionBoundary"" id=""selectionBoundary_1423241598009_25503605001140717"" style=""line-height: 0; display: none;"">?</span>ocky legs. There are printed dishes for the hips and knees, parts it shares with sister set 4483 AT-TE. But there is one thing <em>not</em> among the parts selection that it could very much have used: A small rubber band. Given how much difference that would make, that one little thing takes a whole point off the parts rating. Another thing worth talking about is the two lengths of tubing for detailing the neck: They look okay for that purpose, but they&#39;re very plain parts that don&#39;t really look like Lego at all, so they&#39;re liable to get thrown out by careless parents or anyone else who doesn&#39;t pay much attention to the intricacies of one&#39;s Lego sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four are included in this set.</p>

<ul>
	<li>One Pilot Luke Skywalker, armed with lightsabre and pair-of-studs-with-cord (to represent the harpoon. Sadly no representation of the grenade), to let you re-enact the scene where he single-handedly wrecked a walker while on foot. Nothing different about him compared to the ones from 7130 and 7140.</li>
	<li>The original AT-AT driver minifigure, who (similar to TIE pilots at the time) has AT-AT pilot printing on a Stormtrooper helmet because Lego had yet to create the TIE Pilot helmet piece. His head is a blank yellow one.</li>
	<li>Two Snowtroopers. Like with the Scout Troopers and Clone Troopers of the time, the eyesockets in their helmets are hollow and get the black coloring from the head in order to create a recessed appearance. Unfortunately, they follow the Clone Troopers&#39; route of having an all-black head instead of the Scout Troopers&#39; yellow heads with giant sunglasses printed on (letting the heads work outside the helmets just as well as within). Also unfortunately, there&#39;s only two of them, which was problem at the time&nbsp; of release due to the rarity of Imperial troops in general and the unavailability of Snowtroopers in particular outside this set.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a lengthy process. The legs are built in pairs, each leg in a pair ending up diagonally opposite the identical one when attached to the chassis. It&#39;s best to double-build when putting them together or else the build will take longer still. The main body assembles much faster, since it&#39;s hollow. The seats for the Snowtroopers (which, as tends to be the case with Lego chairs be they built of multiple bricks or just the single chair piece, sacrifice usable seating space for looks) are on sliding trays, hidden by plates on hinges. An interesting technique. But when building the body, the instructions tell you to do something that you actually shouldn&#39;t do just yet: Build the part of the head assembly that slides in and clicks to the walker, and attach it. It&#39;s alright to build it to save yourself some back-and-forth flipping, but attaching it is unwise. This is because when you get to the head itself, it&#39;s very difficult to securely attach the axle and cylinder bricks of the neck to the hinged piece in this part of the assembly when it&#39;s already on the walker. And speaking of the head... It&#39;s nicely detailed, but there are parts of it that are a bit messy. The design itself is one of them. With the parts available at the time, Lego was forced to use hinge bricks mounted on 2x2 turntables to get the sides to be at the proper angles within the space limits of the head. But the pieces intended to hold them that way via blocking the path of the handle plate attached to the inner face of each side don&#39;t do it very well, especially if the turntables have developed play in the connection between base and revolving section. Despite the handle plates providing a perfect opportunity to solve the problem with a small rubber band, Lego did not think to include one. As many have pointed out, there&#39;s only seating room for the one driver as built, but I&#39;m not really sure it would be worth modifying it to hold more; It&#39;s not like the AT-ST from the Battle of Endor set where you can see through the &quot;eyes&quot; into the cabin.</p>

<p>A speeder bike is also part of the build (AT-ATs are said to pack them, after all). It&#39;s almost identical in design to the one from 4482 AT-TE (It uses a handle brick with a gap where that one uses a tri-slope brick), and is basically that recolored in white because icy planet. The build is overall solid, the only things tending to come off being the steering vanes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model, while not truly in minifigure scale, is still very tall and imposing. It very much looks the part of the menacing mechanical giants seen marching out of the fog on Hoth. There&#39;s plenty of detail on it where appropriate, it even manages to capture the leg pistons via tiles (appropriate, considering how close the pistons on the movie models are to blending in with the rest of the leg). It&#39;s proportioned well. The head looks a bit messy but gets the shape right. The hump of the middle section somehow ends up not looking as pronounced as it should from the side, but other than that it&#39;s good. The speeder bike is a bit of a space-hog, so between that and the space used by the brick-built chairs there&#39;s only seating for five passengers (someone riding the bike), but it&#39;s not too bad and easily changed if one so desires. The connection between the main body and the chassis, that can be a bit delicate, but it&#39;s not nearly as big a problem as the 2002 Republic Gunship&#39;s connection issue since the AT-AT is most easily picked up from below, which puts the burden of support purely on you.</p>

<p>The speeder bike itself is Lego&#39;s second design for the Aratech 74-Z Speeder Bikes. It captures the curviness of the cowling better than the first design from 1999 does, but as a trade-off it doesn&#39;t do the overall shape (especially not the back) as well. It has the right detailing, such as a backpack to represent the rolled-up tarp or whatever the 74-Zs are always shown packing, skis to represent the pedals, and a megaphone to represent the side turbine... but it could have been better. The 1999 version could have been better. With the speeder bikes, it&#39;s not like the key parts for getting the look right weren&#39;t around when they made the first effort - the motortrike body was very much around at the time! It just took Lego until 2009 to figure it out! And the split handlebars too! Even if they hadn&#39;t wanted to recolor the new Battle Droid arms in &#39;99, the Classic Space robot arms would have worked just as well! ...ranting aside, it&#39;s still an okay speeder bike and fun to swoosh around.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>4483 was Lego&#39;s second big AT-AT (The absolute first being the AT-AT build of the Mindstorms-crossover Dark Side Developer Kit), and their first that was meant to go with minifigures. All in all, it was a very solid set. There were a few flaws to it, chief among them being the shortage of Snowtroopers (Though if you&#39;re getting it <em>now</em>, that&#39;s not nearly as bad as it was at the time of the set&#39;s release since battle packs and other Hoth sets have made it easy to get your hands on more - when the set came out it was the <em>only</em> set with Snowtroopers) and the lack of a much-needed small rubber band. But those aside, it&#39;s a very nice set. The minifigures are all good choices. Yes, even Pilot Luke. He was included so that the re-enactment fun of his epic walker takedown did not require you to buy another set, and even if you don&#39;t really need an extra of Luke himself, an extra lightsabre never hurt anybody (especially given how they&#39;re one of those things that just looooves to get lost). The walker can actually hold a few walking poses, and if you&#39;re careful can even work for stop-motion. The head connection can end up weak if you don&#39;t make sure the piece at the end of the neck is securely connected to the round bricks, but if you do make sure of that it stays on nicely. And you even get a speeder bike to play with. It was very much worth the $100 US it was priced for on release, and if you can get it for a non-insane price now would still be worth getting.</p>
