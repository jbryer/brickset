(btw im not that fond of jarjar)","after the purchase of the mini at-st + snowspeeder, which i found stunning, i decided to pick the other three ones up as well. good thing i made that decision, 'cause the other ones are great too. this is my second favourite of the minis wave I (at-st snowspeeder the 1st) because of the x-wing which just looks awesome for its small size, as does the tie advanced, but its a bit dull on the wings. heck, they're supposed to be this plain since they are in the movie, so lego made a good choice not to include blue highlights (as they did with the minifig sized vader tie) but still, some printed wings with the solar panel pattern would have been a welcome addition, though it could have made the set a lot more expensive. so i'm happy with wat i've got. my only other complaint (which is nitpicking) is that the x-wings are a little too thick. it's not too bad and the printed parts make up for the thick wings so i'm happy. i've read that some people hate the printed parts, since they are not very handy for custom designs and its a cheap way of adding details. as for me, i'm very sure i like these minis as much as i do because of the printed parts, they make the tiny models look less dull and add that xtra bit of detail that makes these sets for me a classic. Hope to see more waves of minis here in the Netherlands soon.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T01:53:27Z","Nice piece of work","For four dollars, this was the first Lego mini set I bought, and one that I don't regret buying. Both ships are decent toys at a mercifully cheap price for anything with the words Lego and Star Wars together on it. The designs are ingeneous, and I see why Lego is eager to have a line of economy-priced sets, but I'd still rather have cheaper minifig-scale sets. The X-wing is accurate, but as you could have guessed, the wings are just a bit wobbly. The TIE suffers from a similar problem.

I bought this today, I build them, which took me many many minutes (to open the plastic bag and just two minutes to put together). This is the Now economy, easy to build, cheap to buy. No wonder the're so difficult to hit, they are so very small. Love the detail, very high swoosh-factor. I'm gonna buy the rest of them and mayby some more X-wings and snow speeders. Mayby two AT-ST's can make an AT-AT??? I think someone at lego can really build, if you can make something this beautifull with so little bricks. I salute you, thanks thanks thanks!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-05T01:16:20Z","Best Mini Set EVAR!","Yeah, this one is my favorite.  The Tie-Deluxe is just so damn sweet looking, and large too I might add...and the X-Wing is in a nice scale with the snowspeeder and the Jedi Starfighter as well.  

It doesn't get much better in the first wave.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T02:35:19Z","Fire away at the minis, kid","This set was my first mini set I ever got. It was easy to build and fun to play with. the only downsides is the wings on the awesome TIE-Fighter keep falling off. I re-build this set after I thought I lost some TIE fighter parts but I found them all. This is a great mini set.
Pluses:
* Cool TIE
* Cool X-Wing
Minuses:
* Not enough support for the wings on the TIE fighter
* Wings on TIE keep falling off
Overall get this set because it truly is a great mini.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:22:21Z","Nice Chase......but......","          This is a nice set for a mini! It costs nothing and the ships are some of the favorites! The X-wing's wings are hard to position correctly because they are all independant from eachother. The detail with small pieces is amazing! 
The TIE Advanced is nice and is very cool to make dogfights with because the can maneuver very well without the largness getting in the way! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T09:26:05Z","Looks Pretty Good","This set looks good, but there are a couple of problems.

Tie
The tie is a bit bulky, but not to bad. Sometimes the wings fall off but not really.

X-wing
The X-wings wings are hard to position so they look good, and they keep moving and fall ing off.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

PROS:
Xwing wings dont come off as easy 
excellent diagram of the real version for both

CONS:
Ties wings fall off easy
hard to get xwings wings straight",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2007-08-24T19:47:50.38Z","mini Size, MEGA Fun","I think who ever came with the idea for the first minis had a good idea!

PROS
Minis are recognizable (unlike many Mocs I've seen).
Set is cheep.
Comes with some parts to combine with other minis, and build a tie bomber.
No annoying decals.

Cons
A mini stand for display would be nice...

"smiley905","2007-12-11T20:23:42.717Z","best mini set i have","the x wing is definitly my favorite, its wings are nice, they are a little hard to get just right, but it doesnt bother me, the tie is abit bulky and could definetly be more detailed. it would be a good set to have a little battle with. if you got a bunch of these (or other mini fighters) you could have massice space dog-fights!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-02T13:53:52.45Z","Mini X-wing Fighter and TIE Advanced","This set includes two mini sized sets that are like all the other Star Wars mini, a mini sized replica of the normal sized sets. This includes the X-wing Fighter and the TIE Advanced. The TIE advanced is good builted in comparison with some other TIE mini sets and the color scheme is nice, altough have so much blue. The design still good but the front can be better, it have no much details, but this mini set still recognizable with the original. The X-wing Fighter is also good builted and still in a good color scheme. The wings fall sometimes when playing and it is also not much nicely builted, these don't moves very well. Altough these works bad, the building still nice and the set recognizable. The playability is like the other mini sets, a basic playability. Altough the x-wing's wings are bad positioned, it still good when playing with because the wings don't unbuild, only moves not much well. Overall, two nice mini sized sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T15:19:29.81Z","Lots of pieces","I got this like all the other minisets for $4. The set has 76 pieces in it which is alot for $4. It also incudes pieces to build a section of the mini tie bomber. You can easily grab a couple of sets and make a great display and you won't have to pay a fortune on big sets. I do not know why people complain about mini sets, they seem fine to me! OVERALL, I like this set which is why it gets a 5-star rating.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jakelongdragon","2008-08-03T01:35:50.5Z","Nice fun set","This set was great for the price. I played with it a lot and kept it in a small plastic box with me all the time. This is not a collector item. It is more something fun to play with if you like star wars. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-29T09:55:54.873Z","great chase","this set is fun to play with but X-wing definately is the better model. the tie advance is okay but it isn't as iconic as the x-wing is. this set has some nice printed pieces and maybe lego could do some full size sets with vehicle's from both sides.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-28T10:14:01.723Z","LEGO Star Wars - X-Wing Fighter & TIE Advanced Review","This is one of the first LEGO Star Wars mini sets which came out and it's also a good set, because it has two mini space ships in one set. We get a nice x-wing with movable wings. The gray stud on the top of this vehicle is supposed to be R2-D2 The TIE advanced doesen't have any play features but it looks nice. What I like about this set is that you get some extra pieces to build a part of another mini Star Wars space ship. You can build that vehicle - which is a mini TIE bomber - if you got all sets with those parts. And there're 4 sets in total to collect if you want to build a mini TIE bomber.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Caldlow","2011-01-12T08:16:46.59Z","About the greatest difference...","I have ever seen is when you put these two next to the USC Millenium Falcon. But that's what makes this a good set. It is small, yet the resemblance is very good, and it being so small and containing so few pieces, I think it might be even harder to design than, let's say this <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7110-1"">Sandspeeder</a>.<div><br></div><h4>Building and parts:</h4><p>Building these two ships is not much of a task, considering the little amount of pieces, so this is not a set to build, but to play with. I see a lotof complaints about the X-wing's wings falling of easily. I must say I don't have that problem.</p><p><br></p><h4>Playability and price:</h4><p>Playing is what these mini building-sets are made for. They are small, easy to hold, easy to fly around, which should get you some exiting chases through your house.</p><p>A small set with a small price, so there should be no complaints.</p><p><br></p><h4>Finish:</h4><p>Overall, this set is fun, and even though it's not really to display, it's still fun for a pure collector like me (I don't play, just build en enjoy looking at the creations).</p><p><br></p><p>Caldlow</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,5,4

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-17T12:01:33.173Z","Stay on the Leader","<p>Set #4484 X-Wing Fighter &amp; TIE Advanced: LEGO Introduced us to the world of Mini-Kits with these wonderful sets. And they have been a very fun and interesting number of sets to see develop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Kits or Mini-Sets of the LEGO Star Wars theme offer up the chance to build small scale replicas of the larger vessels in the Star Wars universe. They use a finite level of pieces to give the allusion of the much larger vehicles and they do a very good job of it. Originally packaged two together for the smaller vehicles in this first wave, it would soon become one of the best parts of the LEGO Star Wars Theme, in my opinion, and unlike the Technic Sets being offered up beforehand these have real staying power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-X-Wing Fighter is a blast to just fiddle and play with. The step by step instructions take very little time to build the model and when it's done you can have fun and exciting space battles with all your Mini-Kit sets. This set represents the climactic battle at the end of A New Hope between Vader and Luke.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-TIE Advanced is a very good representation of Vader's iconic TIE Fighter and looks suitably menacing. This ship is a tad more durable than the X-Wing, admittedly both models from the set are very fun and great, but the X-Wing's wings do have a tendancy to get a little loose as time and multiple excursions into space/battle go on. The only regret I can think of is that LEGO did not think to include a few extra smallish pieces to make display stands for all of these vehicles, but I'm sure that can be easily solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first few years worth of Mini-Sets did however include extra pieces to build up two more Mini-Kits, thus if you were to pick up 4484-4487 you would have all the pieces necessary to build an Imperial TIE Bomber in Mini-Kit form. (I'll go into more detail on that kit with the last review from this series.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that these Mini-Sets are must haves for any LEGO Star Wars fan, especially those who have a hard time picking up the larger and more expensive sets with the Starfighters. As a bonus if you happen to have the Death Star many of these Mini-Kits would be in scale with it, I believe. If you are picking up this one and are looking to also make the TIE Bomber, make sure that you get all four sets from the first batch and that they are either still sealed or include all of the spare pieces to build the TIE Bomber, otherwise you'll miss out on part of the fun of these earlier sets. As a real bonus it wouldn't be much of a stretch to transform these Mini-Sets into LEGO Star Wars themed decorations for your Christmas Tree, I haven't tried it myself, but if you celebrate Christmas and want to see some nifty little LEGO Star Wars ships on your tree, try it out. It might just be really fun and a great activity to do with the children.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
