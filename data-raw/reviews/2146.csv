"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T07:09:28Z","Really cool!","I got this a few days ago. Man it is awesome! Those orange electro binders can be used for a MoC for Plo Koon, since is light saber is orange.
Anyway, I like how they used clear laser cannon peices to make it &quot;float&quot; instead of the tan pieces of the Mos Eisley Podrace set. It looks wierd on a white carpet!
The construction of Sebulba's pod, with the split engine, is incredible. 
The spare parts to make the TIE Bomber wing are the same as X-Wing and TIE Advanced's spare parts. I got two of these because I lost my first one, all except the spares, and made the TIE Bomber from the two wings from two Podracer Sets.
Now I love these sets, and I'm getting all from all series.... That includes the Mini TIE....I'll have to order the series 3 kit. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-29T14:55:13Z","SAH-WEET!","My first Mini-Model... it inspired me to get all of series one. 
Well anyway, on with the review.
The orange pieces for the power couplings are great. They are so awesome, howevever if it had been purple like in the movie I would have been happier.
The clear starship cannon was great. LEGO finally understood not all people have sand colored carpets.
The colors are true to the movie, and therefore undisagreeable. 
The construction is great, just I think the lines connecting the pods to the engines could have been thrown in. In the next mini models series, lets see some more pods!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T07:57:19Z","Not that great.","well the detail is ok but i find that the fun will playing with them is pretty low mainly because i didnt really like the podracers that much but still at least if i want to have a pod race I'll use the larger versons instead. the only reason i got this set was becasue i wanted all of the mini's  and the tiebomber piece.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-21T15:28:15Z","my least favourite of the mini's, but still great!","i have to say TLC did a pretty good job at recreating Ani's and Sebulba's pods in mini scale. they look like their movie counterparts and Sebulba's pod is bigger than Ani's, as it's supposed to be.
they 'float' on clear stands, which is a far better idea than the tan parts the minifig scaled pods 'float' on. however, the part that holds the 'power couplings' (the orange lightsaber bars) is gray, instead of clear, making it stand out more than it should. The pods also lack strings or cables to resemble the hoses connecing the engines to the cockpits in their movie counterparts, and thus require the clear stands and gray pieces to keep the parts together.
there's one more gripe, the power couplings in the movie were pink/purple, why are they orange here? purple sticks would have been very VERY handy to make a custom Mace Windu minifig, who wields a purple lightsaber, but the poor guy was never reproduced in lego form :(
now we've got these orange sticks, which might be useful to make a custom Plo Koon. that guy is known to use lightsabers of virtually every primairy and secundairy colour (except for red), but orange seems to be his favourite colour. however, i would still have preferred purple sticks for the power couplings.

so overall, these pods are great, except for the few gripes mentioned above, and thats why I took one point off.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-23T16:17:55Z","My least favourite original mini...","...it's still very good though. I don't think the pods were the best ideas because you can't collect more. They're still pretty good though, I didn't even really like the big pods so this is very good for a mini.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-12T21:26:41Z","Don't miss it!","I purchased this set as part of the Mini Collection only to get the parts to build a TIE bomber. I thought this set would be utter junk, just like the 90 usd minifig-scale Mos Espa Podrace.  I was wrong.  For four bucks, you get two pods, with a remarkable level of accuracy. The orange flashlight/barrel tap bricks on Sebulba's pod really make the cockpit look realistic, as does the clear stand.  The overall shapes of the pods were both very nice, and i especially liked the use of the four-rod yellow pieces on the front of Anakin's pod engines. (you know those pieces; they're the ones from the Lego palmtrees)  The best part about these pods, however, is their &quot;swooshability&quot;.  The 'fig-scale podracers were not swooshable; they were clunky and prone to breakage.  The MINI pods can be raced easily due to their small size and low weight.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:24:33Z","Very Nice Set!!!!!!!!","       This set is very fine! It is engenius how lego made the mobiles with real small familiar pieces!  Sebulba's podracer is the best with the large split-x engines but anakin's just looks faster. The use of the transparent cannon pieces are very neet to attaching the engine and pods. A great and cheap way to reexperience one of the most dashing scenes in Ep1!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-29T04:25:22Z","Just about the weirdest mini","This set looks downright strange, with an odd assembly of pieces.

"Gus_263","2008-03-27T15:25:34.31Z","Nice mini","This set of Star Wars theme is one of the mini sized sets. As mini, the pod racers cannot inlude minifigures on it. So, this set not have minifigures. Like the Pod racers in the lego normal size, these mini have a nice color scheme. Also nicely designed, this set includes some useful pieces and the podracers looks like the podracers of the movie in the motors, the shape and the colors. The cockpit is good builted but not looks like the cockpit of the podracer in the movie. The podracer of Sebulba and the podracer of Anakin are very similar. The both are supended by a transparent piece, that is not good for playability and is also bad for design. This piece also connects the motors and the cockpit, and the place of it looks like wrong, because in the movie and also in the lego podracers sets with normal size, the connection of the cockpit is on the sides of the podracer. Altough this set have a good design, some useful pieces and a basic playability due to the size, some pieces looks like to be on a wrong place. So, i rate these PodRacers 4/5    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Anakin's Pod- Really, the only thing to talk about are the engines. They resemble the Pod's engines, but it should only have 3 prongs each. And there's the cockpit, which also resembles the actual cockpit nicely.
Sebulba's Pod- I say it's better than Anakin's. The engines are acurate and big, though it's not to scale with the other pod. The cockpit is also nice.
Really, there's not much else. They do not have the cords that connect the cockpit with the engines. But, overall, a good set. I don't quite recommend it though. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Hylocera","2017-02-08T23:32:42.11Z","The Race is On!","<p>This will be a short review because there isn&#39;t too much to be said about such a small set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want mini-scale podracers, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30057-1/Anakin-s-Pod-Racer"">30057</a>&nbsp;(Anakin&#39;s) and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9675-1/Sebulba-s-Podracer-Tatooine"">9675</a>&nbsp;(Sebulba&#39;s) are two more recent iterations of the vehicles that are not much more expensive than this one, and better detailed and designed. They are at a slightly larger scale, if that is an issue.</p>

<p>Most of the parts included are relatively common, so rebuilding this set from your own collection shouldn&#39;t be too much of an issue. Unlike other sets in this series, like <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/4484-1"">4484</a>&nbsp;X-Wing Fighter &amp; TIE Advanced, none of the parts are printed. The techniques aren&#39;t very complicated so the building experience probably won&#39;t be very interesting either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only reason I personally would buy this set is for nostalgia, since I had one years and years ago. They&#39;re very swooshable, but the more recent ones probably are too. I guess what I&#39;m trying to say, in the end, is not that this is a bad set, but rather one that has been outdone by the expanded range of techniques and parts available in more recent versions, and one that would not be difficult to remake on your own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sebulba's Podracer is quite an interesting looking miniature. I especially like that both Podracer's use a unique colored lightsaber blade piece to mimic the energy between engines, that way if you were feeling adventurous or just wanted to throw in some spice you could create your own Mini-Figure Jedi and give him or her an Orange Lightsaber. The vehicle is also fairly close to accurate I'd say for such a small model.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anakin's Podracer uses yellow and blue to great effect making for a model that stands out on the shelf, just as Sebulba's orange and black tone allow for his to stand out. There are some really nice pieces in this set and both models look wonderful next to larger Mini-Kit based displays. (And yes I am aware that Mini-Kit is the term used from the games, but it makes sense to use it here.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this set is a nice little addition to your Mini-Kit collection from LEGO Star Wars and on top of that it has a few unique pieces such as the orange lightsaber hilt and I believe Sebulba's Podracer also includes two orange Mini-Figure style heads in it's construction. They are blank of course, but they do look good and for MOCers unique colored pieces are always a plus.
