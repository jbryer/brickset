"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-21T16:54:35Z","the best MINI set, but...","Its good, the best MINI set, howver the AT-ST is flimsy much like the minifig scale one, its hard to move its legs and, its just rubbish.

Ahhh, if its rubbish why did i give it a 7? ask yourselves, THE SNNWSPEEDER, its fantastic it looks so much like the real one, something that the MINI models hardlyever do, i love the back bit.
one flaw, you have to add an extra brick at the bottom to keep it from falling apart.

Overall a good set for the snowspeeder if your prepared to sacrifice sme money for a rubbish AT-ST.

The design of the AT-ST legs are overall annoying.It always falls when I try to display it, and when it finally stands up, its in a funky position with its head in the air.
The snowspeeder is awesome. Its so small that I can't see half of it when I hold it!
A good set for the pieces, the price, and the overall design.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-20T12:42:39Z","mini's... love 'em. why? because of this set!","this was my first mini. i wanted it because of the at-st, which looked great for such a small model. i didn't care for the snowspeeder, but thought: what the heck, 2 euros (2,42 dollars) for a nice li'l at-st and a tiny thingie that's supposed to resemble a snowspeeder as an added bonus, i'll take it.

i'm glad to say i was wrong. the at-st looked even better on top of my desk than on the pic and it features a swivelling head and fully poseable legs (articulated at the hips, knees and ankles) and a great printed flag, to resemble the 'face' of the at-st chicken walker, it's got two guns at his cheeks as well and they're different from each other, one (the joystick) resembles the standard laser blaster, while the other (the crane) looks like the rocket/grenade-launcher. it's got the binoculairs piece to represent the nose-cannons. no complaints on the at-st at all.

now onto the reason why i was happy to be wrong. it's the snowspeeder. while being tiiiiiny, it's great!
it's got a terrif design which allows it to be in the right scale with the at-st, look cute, resemble it's movie-counterpart and allow some great details, all at once! the parts used are great, with a small printed, flat 1X1 piece for the nose design, dark grey solid lightsaber sticks as guns and a 2X1 black grate for the engines. the canopy consists of a dark clear 2X1 flat brick and the orange parts prevent the snowspeeder from looking plain and boring. and have i mentioned it looks cute?

so, it's rather simple: all top-notch and a perfect 10! this set was reason enough for me to buy the other three mini-sets as well. thank you lego!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T12:47:27Z","Beautiful","The Mini AT-ST is one of the better minis in my opinion. The details are very good for the smaller minis (the first four mini sets) and the Snowspeeder and AT-ST are in fairly good scale with each other. This set is good by itself, so I'll give it a 10/10. However, if you own the Mini AT-AT, you would know that this set it extremely out of proportion to it. In the end though, lego is lego, and you have to love the creativity put into the Starwars Minis!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-23T16:01:01Z","Mini, nice walker, tinsy speeder!","       This is a nice Hoth mini-battle maker! You dont see many AT-STs on Hoth but you can make them here! Uses a nice leg system using gears and it has a nice cabin details and nice lasers and cannons! The airspeeder is way to small and looks dwarfed to the AT-ST, which the speeder is larger than! The snowspeeder may be dwarfed, but it's harpoon cable gun and blasters may be a tough ideal for the scout walker! This is a nice set and it is great to make one on one matches, rebels verse the imperials!

the at-st looks much better than the minifig-version
the colors are really much better, no tan at all
also the parts are really usefull - 2,5

the snowspeeder is not so good because the wing are a bit wobbly
the colors are good, 
also it came with 2 (!) front 1x1 plates (that one with the print on it)

This is the best part of the set it looks right, and fun to play with as well as being surprisingly fun to build.

"IrateCorpse","2009-01-27T12:30:59.247Z","Nyyyooowwwmmmm...","The Snowspeeder's simplicity in this kit, considering its accuracy, is just brilliant. It's easily the best dinky Star Wars thing (LEGO or otherwise) ever.

The AT-ST comes a close 2nd in my eyes. Its imperfections give it a lot of character and though some say it's looks a bit odd, I think its features are well defined enough that it is recognisable instantly. Plus the AT-ST's printed face flap is a cool unique piece! :)

A brilliant purchase if you can still find it somewhere.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-07T19:31:23.547Z","ooooo, Accuracy","Snowspeeder is incredibly accurate. Even though its like 3/4th and inch (I haven't measured it, so I'm not guarenteeing anything). It's an adorable little ship.
The AT-ST isn't quite as accurate. The front is a little goofy looking because it's flat and has no depth. The guns look good and are nicely sized compared to the rest of the figure. The top section also can loosely spin around. The legs are terrible, however. They don't have much posability with bending the legs forward. But they support the walker.
Overall, a good set. The snowspeeder is the strong point of this set, and the AT-ST being it's downfall. But it's still good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-29T10:21:14.517Z","LEGO Star Wars - AT-ST & Snowspeeder Review","This is also one of the very first LEGO Star Wars mini sets. It also comes with two vehicles. This time we get a mini snowspeeder and a mini AT-ST. For the AT-ST we get a nice printing on the cockpit and the legs and the cockpit are movable. The snowspeeder doesn't really have any play features but it still looks good. This set also has some pieces to build the mini TIE bomber which you can build if you got all 4 sets which come with two mini vehicles. It's a great set to have and it's also great for pieces.

"AETerry","2010-11-03T01:56:31.783Z","#4486 Mini Set Review","<p>The first thing that's notable to me about these Mini Sets are their prices and the ability to create Star Wars vehicles in minature with some good detail. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They've been fun to build and set around for display. And after one move, I found that these had actually held together fairly well having been in storage.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-18T10:40:38.137Z","Imperial Walkers Have Been Spotted","<p>Set #4486 AT-ST &amp; Snowspeeder: This third set&nbsp;of the initial four sets released when LEGO introduced the Minis is an interesting display piece and fun to play with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using simple instructions and a small number of pieces you get to build a Rebel Snowspeeder and an Imperial All-Terrain-Scout Transport. Both models look well crafted and have amazing detail for being so small, on the plus side unlike the other three you could easily buy more than one of this set in order to have a nice little collection of Snowspeeders and AT-STs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That isn't to say you couldn't buy doubles of the others, but aside from the X-Wing most of the other sets featured unique single-piloted craft for certain characters. These two models are generic, in that they don't belong specifically to any one Rebel or Imperial character.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that the new Mini line of Star Wars vehicles was a smashing success for LEGO and is proven by the continued support of Minis in the line. I strongly recommend them to everyone because these LEGO Star Wars sets offer up fun little models that can be played with without fear of potential breakage. You could have endless fun with an army of Mini ships. Or display them all together in one corner of the Star Wars LEGO area and you'll see some wonderful potential. Also MOCers will certainly enjoy the pieces that come with the sets for any builds they have planned.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
