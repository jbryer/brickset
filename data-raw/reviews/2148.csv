"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T07:22:06Z","Cool Mini Set","I also got this in my stocking for Christmas. These are so cool!
The design of the Slave 1 is ingenius, it looks exactly like the Movie ship. The wings never fall off for me, because I hold it on the very bottom.
The Jedi Starfighter is awesome! It is really aerodynamic for a LEGO set, especially one using only exsisting bricks.
I love this set for the pieces, the price, and the design.(definitely!)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T08:06:52Z","''Blast This is why I hate flying!''","cool cool cool this is defenatly one of best MINI sets out there. and like evryone else said it is one os the best dog fights in Star Wars. i really like the detail on Slave 1 and the Jedi Starfighter, incredible!!!! the only resone i gave it 9/10 is because i dont like giving MINIs perfects because I like the bigger versons more.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-21T16:02:27Z","another great mini set!","after the mini at-st + snowspeeder and the mini x-wing + tie advanced, this is my favourite starwars mini set.

the jedi starfighter is just flawless, with it's sleek design that just screams high speed and maneuverability. it features two printed parts, which add to the details on this fighter, but the model doesn't rely on these two pieces to look good. just replace the two pieces with unprinted pieces. the model will still look good.

the slave 1 is great as well, the wings can be put in it's flying position, as shown on the picture above, or in the ground position, in which the slave 1 lays on it's back with the wings turned resting on the ground. the flatiron design of the ship in the movie has been recreated perfectly in this small scale, and again a printed part adds to the detail without being neccesary.

with everything top-notch, why ain't i giving this set a ten? because of one small gripe, the somewhat flimsy wings on the slave 1, besides that, everything is great, so it gets a 9!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-24T20:16:25Z","Little Good Bar","This is the perfect recreator of the fantastic seen in the movie. I love the slave 1 and the starfighter is always a goodie. it is a good set to pretend with because the ships are small  and easy to hold. This is good. Buy it if you like mini's. I like the big expensive stuff like the real slave 1 and jedi starfighter not mini.
Byb the way, WHO LOVES THE X-WING! IT ROCKS!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-05T01:11:22Z","Good Solid Set","Great sequence in the film, pretty good set.  I really like the solid nature of the Rebel Starfighter, but there's just soemthing lacking in Slave 1 that I can't quite put my finger on.  Still it's a good set, and it has that extra piece for the Tie Bomber.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T02:40:10Z","Release the spare parts, now","This set is wicked. It was my second mini set and it is fun to build and easy to play with and vise-versa. The Jedi starfighter was a brilliant little build if you ask me but the slave 1 just seemed to missing something, but maybe it's just me. As I like the newer minis better I have slightly grown to like the others over this. Maybe thats the reason I think the Slave 1 is missing something. 
Oh well overall a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:27:14Z","Best 1-1 Dogfight scene ever!!!!","      This set is dashing! The Slave 1 is the best part, it really looks like the slave 1! They are big enough to hold under control and are small enough to maneuver fast!  The Slave 1 ship being way more powerful but the Jedi Starfighter being faster, who shall win? Go Jango!!!! The Delta-7 Aethersprite Interceptor (Jedi Starfighter) is fast and look much real as a mini! Glad they released this set, so very very glad!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tauntaunwampa","2007-08-16T05:24:51.363Z","Mr. Average","This Set is pretty average, yes it is good but its not to scale with the other minis it is very good for play dogfights (But why couldnt we have 5 arms)

PROS
no stickers 
small pieces 
good for dogfights

CONS
wings of slave 1 fall of
not to scale with other minis

i got this set because i wanted the tie bomber but i do use these ships occasionly.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2007-08-26T07:59:41.16Z","Last Mini! ! !","If it weren't for the horrible Slave 1, I'd give this a 10/10.

PROS
Amazing Jedi Star fighter Thingy.
No stupid decals.

CONS
Slave 1, despite being to scale, has no detail, wrong colores (or is it colorus?), and looks awful.  Being that Slave 1 is my favorite star wars vehicle of all time (pods come second), I will NOT stand for this!
That is such a big con it will count twice!

OVERALL
I guess after reviewing all the minis, I have to end on a sad note.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hedgehog_lover","2007-07-13T15:48:46.467Z","Cheesy set","This mini rests in pieces inside my big box of Lego along with my other minis.Once again i shall do a pros and cons review.

Pros:
acurate
can have mini battles

Cons;
Slave 1's side wings fall off
both fragile
Limited playability
Slave 1 cannons are  fragile

Buy if you want to build the mini tie bomber or need parts.
Don't buy if you don't want to waste money that could be used to buy a good set.

"Leggodt94","2008-07-07T22:25:54.013Z","Good interpretation ","I really like this mini set, and it's by far one of my favorites.

slave I and the Jedi star fighter than this set is perfect for you! You are able to make great displays of amazing star wars battles with these mini-sets! It also includes parts for the mini tie bomber!
So, overall this set is reasonably priced and is handy for your collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-29T14:19:56.747Z","one of my favourite mini's","This set is, well, just read the title and find out. Unfortunately all of the other of the mini's in this series one of them is great but the other is just average. In this one Obi's fighter is the better of the two. It's small but sleek and has printed bricks. The slave 1 lets this set down. It's a bit to clunky, the wings don't look right aand there aren't any redeeming features.

"Kalhiki","2009-11-07T19:38:47.7Z","good detail","For a mini, this is great. Obi Wan's starfighter is a little basic, but it's a mini model, what are you going to do? The designs on the top front add detail and make up for the basic design. The Slave I is a little better. It's definately larger than the Jedi Starfighter, but is equally detailed. 
There isn't much else. What you see in the picture is pretty much what you get. So Overall a good set. The lack of originality is the downfall in the set, but It's better than most minis.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-29T10:32:13.62Z","LEGO Star Wars - Jedi Starfighter & Slave I Review","This is also one of the very first LEGO Star Wars sets ever. It's a great set and it's part of the movie 'Star Wars - Episode II' where Jango Fett chased Obi-Wan Kenobi. This set is also a set which has some rare pieces. There're no stickers in this set which means that these pieces are valuable. The space ships may don't have any play features but this set is a great set to get for pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's. But I think you should try to get the bigger ones first before you get this one.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Hylocera","2010-04-17T16:14:53.14Z","Cool Mini","&nbsp;This was a mini I got for Christmas a while ago, and I remember struggling over the pieces ( I was like 4 then) impatiently trying to finish the set. It was a great thing to be able to stick a LEGO Set in your pocket for a car trip and not have to worry about lost pieces. The best thing was that because they were so small, you could easily play with them, instead of juggling the larger Slave I and Obi Wan's Jedi Starfighter in each hand. The simple build allowed even the most impatient of kids to finish it quickly for play. The only problem with this set was that it could have come with a couple astroids, just like the podracers could've come with a finish line or some pinnacles. 4/5",FALSE,4,4,5,5,4

<p>For me, I like the Slave I Ship given that it's Boba Fett's ship. The other doesn't bother me too much. Either way, both are great and have been fun to build and place around for display.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,4

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-18T10:49:36.58Z","I Hate Flying","<p>Set #4487 Jedi Starfighter &amp; Slave 1: This is the last of the first group of four Minis and it is fitting that we get a scene from Attack of the Clones out of it. It is also a nice little set that offers up some rare Mini-Kit vehicles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Jedi Starfighter truly captures the vehicle&nbsp;in Mini scale. And the colors on it are actually quite nice. The Slave 1 is Jango's pride and joy and a very interesting looking vessel in Mini scale. With some nice unique pieces and a few rich color choices both vessels are really great looking and fun little ships using the same basic principles of the other three.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now to discuss the TIE Bomber Mini as promised. 4484-4487 all included extra pieces to build up&nbsp;a Mini-Kit of the TIE Bomber. The TIE Bomber is a wonderful additional bonus to have, it resembles the vehicle in question quite nicely and uses some great pieces. It was the selling point of the Minis for the first two years, buy all four and you get an additional fifth vehicle, or ninth in the case of the first batch since you got two models with each set. A pity the Minis stopped being such a regular fixture of the line to include that sort of deal in future offerings, but it wasn't all bad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is worthy of becoming a part of your collection. All of the Minis are definitely great value for your money and the playability of these sets is beyond measure. The only reason I've scored them as four rather than five is simply because I feel that they aren't exactly five brick material, simply because they are simple and easy to build and use up fairly limited parts. But I could change my mind in the future and shift them up a notch, simply because of the fun factor alone. If you don't already own any of these wonderful sets try your best to get them, they are worthy of joining any LEGO Star Wars enthusiasts collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
