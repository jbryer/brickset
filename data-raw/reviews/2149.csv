PLUS
*It looks like the what its supposed to be, not many other MINIs can manage that
*Some class pieces

MINUS
*the radar doesnt turn all the way round, qand, is woobly
*the cockpit could at least be a diifferent colour

(but the piture of this set in Lego magazine was backwards, the cockpit and the satilit dish were on the wrong sides.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-24T09:12:31Z","Great model","This mini is great, it's fun to build and displays well along side my other SW's.

The only complaint I have is with the manual, one set calls for you to attach a 3x3 angled to the underside of the model but given the angle the picture is on, attaching the piece correctly took many attempts.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-05T12:41:17Z","Great but not minifig capable...Easy to build though","I love this set! Its detailed for its size but its not minifig capable and the cockpit is not detailed. If ya dont like dis set I bash ya teeth out!!! whats that? you dont!!?? well thats your problem buddy!! WACK!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T02:44:31Z","&quot;What a hunk of Junk&quot;- luke","I don't reflect this set as my review summary puts it. I've quoted it incase others think I hate it. This set is great but compared to the big millennium falcon it justs lack that bit of cockpit and  birds eye detail. 
Pluses:
* Cool little mini
* Easy to play with 
Minuses:
* Cockpit should have a different colour and top should have a tad more detail
Overall another great mini by lego

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:29:17Z","Best Mini Model!","    The Falcon? It is a great ship, and unlike the regular model you can play with it with ease! It is a very similar model to the mvies and captures most of the big details!  It is larger than the palm of your hand, but you can really play with it, which I am thankful for!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tauntaunwampa","2007-08-16T05:30:06.41Z","A collection without this is a breeze","this has to be hands down the best mini model ever the detail is fantastic and lookes awsome. This spacecraft is a pro at dogfights and easy to build the only problem is that the solar dish always comes off.

PROS
great detail
good for dogfights 
awsome back lights
CONS
solar dish comes off easyly

this is a must have for all lego star wars collectors",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T13:18:46.047Z","Another good builted mini sized replica","This mini version of the Millennium falcon is another of the mini replicas of the Star Wars theme, and like some other, still cool due to the building. As a mini set, this millennium falcon of course don't includes a minifigure. Altough is just another mini set, this is too good builted in comparison with the size, and still recognizable. The building consists in some encurved or triangular small plates conneceted by some other pieces and above these is a circular big piece, used as the top of the millennium falcon, with some printed designs to looks like more it. The piece used in the place of the cockpit have a correct shape but the design don't looks like more it, altough have also the correct colors. The color scheme is good, but not much detailed. As a mini set, the playability is limited, but the set includes useful pieces. Overall, a good mini sized set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-28T17:23:58.67Z","Fastest ship in the galaxy","When i got this I was very surprised that a set would have special printed bricks which to my knowledge aren't in any other sets. I liked the build and found it mor fun to build than the gunship. Overall it turned out well too. The way the cockpit has been added on seems clever and this is overall a good set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-07T19:46:35.95Z","Brilliant!","Very good for a mini set. It's simpicity actually adds to the accuracy and uniquness (does that make sense?). It's painted top adds the main detail of the model. It also has the dish which is in scale to the rest of the model. The cockpit could at least have a sticker to make it more accurate or a painted surface. The engines are also flat instead of rouned around the back. It also includes the escape pods on either side.
Overall, a good set. It's better than othe minis, but I still give it a 4/5. Definately get it if you're going to get a mini set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-06T11:35:40.983Z","LEGO Star Wars - Millennium Falcon Review","This set is part of the second wave of the mini Star Wars collection. This time LEGO decided to produce only one mini model in one set. But we still get some extra pieces to build another mini Star Wars vehicle. If you've collected all 4 sets of this wave (sets 4488, 4489, 4490 &amp; 4491) you can build a mini y-wing. This set is a fun build and it's very useful if you want to use the pieces for MOC's (My own creations) and brickfilms. This set also comes with some rare pieces which makes it valuable as well. It's a good set to have and I can't complain much about it. We also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2010-11-04T15:15:04.13Z","Mini Millennium Falcon Review","<p>The mini sets for Star Wars that LEGO has done have been some of the best and funnest, even when a particular set isn't ultimately my favorite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With this mini set of the Millennium Falcon, you have one of the cheapest and best ways to get a Lego model of this ship. The build is solid and I found that even after a move and having tossed this into storage, the ship still held together very well with few pieces needing to be put back on.</p>

<p>It's great attention to detail for a Lego model on a mini scale and they're just great to build, set around for disply and affordable prices.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,5
