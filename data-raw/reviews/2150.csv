"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-26T08:36:06Z","Let's design a cockpit in a wind tunnel and build the rest from square steel plates...","Shapes and proportions on this model seem to be a bit off..

I may be wrong, but in my memory, the ATAT head was squarish and not streamlined. The neck was thicker, and the body more elongated and slanted. That said, with about 98 pieces, a passable ATAT can be built. Left over parts make a small fighter plane again.

It wouldn't have gotten much praise from me if there wasn't something else to this set.. There's quite a convincing Sarlacc to be made from the parts. The legs with the discs off make for great larger tentacles, the levers form the smaller ones. One of the dishes serves as a mouth. Throw in the square plate and four wedges and you're ready to gobble up hapless minifigs!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:31:11Z","Make it bigger!!!!","   This is not very accurate to the movies. While the gear legs are a clever way to make it pose, it is deathly small and even the AT-ST is taller than it is, or close! It is far to small and they should have put in a slight bit more detail! It is a nice walker but looks like a dwarf one to your Snowspeeders!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-04T05:54:44Z","A chance for a great mini, but instead a sad mishap","The AT-AT is the perfect model to base a mini on, but, in my opinion, this model is sad and far from accurate. The body is without the desired &quot;plating&quot; look and the head is too low, in the wrong shape. I got this as a birthday present, so I guess I still like it a wee bit. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"david001","2007-03-23T14:33:13.433Z","Two become One","Unfortunately to the same scale as the AT-ST, the AT-AT is not a bad model as such: just a tad too small and *slightly* the wrong shape.  My solution?  Buy two of these, and combine (maybe with some other loose bricks) to build one larger model!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"tauntaunwampa","2007-09-16T05:50:38.14Z","&quot;Don't care how I want it now!&quot;","This set is just too good to be mini i just think that this should be used promoted more,i find this is very good for battles and also hallway battles.
Hoth is my favourite battle in the galactic civil war so thats why it my favourtie.
PROS
nice blasters
good leg movement
CONS
head funny
transport area too big

This is such a good set reccomended for all star wars fanatics

PROS
Good feet design.
Good head design.
Good head guns.

CONS
Too small and blocky, yet still worth your money.

Anyways, this set is a lot bigger than the first four minis, which I like, and it has cool features like adjustable leggs, flapps on the side, guns, and head. Plus, this set is a lot of fun to build. Over all, it has some really good similarities with the real at-at.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-04T17:30:26.373Z","The mini AT-AT","This set of the Star Wars theme is one of the mini building sets, some mini replicas of the normal sets in mini size, and of course, with limited playability and also, not includes a minifigure. This AT-AT have a nice design and color scheme, combining some gray different schemes with few black details. The building is good with the &quot;paws&quot;, and these can moves very well, except the upper part, but are in a good position, connected to the small plate above, used as base. The front is made with some other encurved pieces and still cool in the design. Above the base, are some blocks increasing it and these are also to makes it looks like more an AT-AT. Altough the set is in a mini size and is limited to some playability, is small, it looks like an AT-AT, the design and colors are good, and the playability is due to the size. The pieces are all useful and this mini replica stay good for a mini set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-07T19:52:50.64Z","ew, bleck.","Why do you ask I give it a 3/5? This thing is terrible. It's body is a box. The legs are also too thin, and the feet are big compared to them. The head is a little better than the rest, but not the greatest. I don't know. It just is kinda badly designed. I don't recommend this one. Get a better mini first, and maybe this one if you don't have anything else to get. But definately save it for last.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-06T11:43:31.49Z","LEGO Star Wars - AT-AT Review","This set is part of the second wave of the LEGO Star Wars mini collection and it looks much better than the newer one from 2010 (set 20018). It's a fun little model to build and we also get another part which you can use to build a mini y-wing. The cockpit and the legs can sviwel and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. I think this set can be also very useful for pieces if you want to build some MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms. It's a good little set to have and I don't have much to complain about it.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got it during a stint of picking numerous mini sets for Star Wars and greatly enjoyed putting this together. For the mini scale, Lego seems to have done alright with trying to capture the essences of this vehicle and they've done a fairly good job.</p>

","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>When I first bought this set, I didn't realize that there were extra pieces for a set that could be built from three different sets.

The pieces hold and you can build and rebuild without having them become loose. Collect them all!&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
