This set seems to be coming to the end of its life being sold off cheaply at many sores/sites, but as no one has reviewed it I thought I would. I think this is one of the best Minis as it does look like what it is supposed to and I can’t think of a way to improve its appearance. One problem it has though made straight from the box is the wings wobble. This is easily cured (which is why I rate it as 9) by a 2 x 1 plate with a 2 x 1 tile on top being positioned under the wobbling wing connector – this locks it solid. Why Lego did not include these 2 extra bricks I don’t know.  There is however a grooved 2 x 1 green brick at the front that I have never seen elsewhere - maybe unique? I would have also preferred the turrets in clear plastic rather than grey. Overall it’s good and could have been a maximum score without the wing wobble.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T12:39:03Z","Great Mini","The Mini Republic Gunship is a nice addition to anyone's mini collection, and is very fun to play with with the Mini AT-TE, However, as Monty mentioned, the wings wobble. Other than this, there is no major flaw. The colors are great, and it comes with a few light green pieces Also, not visible on the picture, there is a nice back-firing laser cannon which rotates. The ship is mostly in scale and looks like what it was meant to look like. I'll give this baby a 9/10. It is a great addition to anyone's Mini collection!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-23T16:04:21Z","This gunship rules!","  Okay, I own the full sized gunship, and ofcourse, the bigger one beats this by a mile but the fact that this may have grown up into a large gunship strikes me! It has great detail and the use of small pieces as differant appendages is ingenious! It is not quite MINI, for it is actually a good size, a medium size! The turret guns on the side are cool domes and the front repeating cannons are equally good! This is on one the best mini-models! If you get quite a few of them, you can make a battle of geonosis and other clone war challenges!

"Cashcleaner","2007-02-26T04:52:04.607Z","Great mini kit with nice details","Firstly, I'm a big fan of the Clones and loved the cool Republic vehicles that were developed for episodes 2 and 3, so it was only natural for me to snatch this kit up at the earliest opportunity.  I'm very impressed with how the model displays and building it was a breeze.  The wings can be a bit wobbly, bit it's a small matter and can be rectified with a spot of glue if it gets too annoying.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2007-08-26T12:34:31.707Z","Good Gunship","This is the last time I will use the excuse &quot;my friend has it&quot;, or in some cases &quot;I think my friend has it&quot;, or even &quot;I wish my friend had it&quot;.  Hopefully after this I'll take a break from writing mini reviews, and move on to BIGGER and better things. (ha!, ha!, get it? bigger?, well... er) *sigh*.

Movable wings.

"Gus_263","2008-03-26T17:21:30.217Z","Good builted mini set","This set is one of the mini star wars sets and was released in the year of 2003. I like the building that looks like very good. As a mini set, this replica of the Republic Gunship in Lego mini set don't have much playability and not carries minifigures, but still cool in the color scheme, correctly like in the movie, also the good but easy building and this set is nicely designed. Some details are awesome like the front, wings and cockpits. This set have a little problem with the wings movement, that unbuild some pieces of the mini cockpit, but it still cool. Altough this is a mini set, and due to the size it not have playability or have few pieces, all are useful, but the building is awesome, so, it is a good replica of the republic gunship. In overall, i rate this set 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-16T21:35:06.793Z","Mini Gunship","This is a really nice mini set and also very detailed for a small set. It is very accurate to the movie from the colors to the wings on the back. If you can't afford the minifig scale versions, buy this one instead.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ghostmaker","2008-07-11T12:06:14.09Z","Gunship mini","an awesome model. i had to get this, as i was too skint in my youth for the full size one. i hope that i can get the newly released full sizer. however, that said, this model is brilliant if you want to take a &quot;zoomed out&quot; view of the action, and can hold two minifigs on the footplate, sticking out of the sides. kept me amused for ages, and good fun.

"Yoda____","2008-10-28T17:15:29.75Z","accurate","Well the title says it all in this case. Considering the small size this set is incredibly accurate. There isn't much else to say but I have the mini tie bomber and i only have half the Y-wing but from what I have seen the Y-wing is a lot better so this series as a whole could be classed as the better one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-07T20:00:19.827Z","Better than most, but not the best","Mainly, the lack of detail marks this set down. It's very accuratly designed, though compared to it in the movie. It, at least, includes the main components (sphere guns, weird cockpit, engines). The missle launcher on the top is sticking out too high. If I remember correctly, the wings will tilt when you tilt the ship making it level with the ground.
Overall, a good set. The lack of detail marks this set down, but it's recommended if you don't care about detail.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-07T11:08:31.143Z","LEGO Star Wars - Republic Gunship Review","This is the 3rd out of 4 sets you need to build a mini y-wing with the extra pieces you get in each of these 4 mini sets. It's a great set to have and very easy to build as well. We also don't get any stickers to worry about. I think it's also a good set to get for pieces if you want to make a MOC (My own creations) and/or a brickfilm. It looks much better than the 2009 version (set: 20010) as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2010-11-08T19:51:25.24Z","Republic Gunship Miniset","<p>In all this wasn't a bad set and it's price at $7 makes it an affordable Star Wars set to get and add to one's collection. And that's largely the draw for me with this, was being able to afford the price of several of these minisets and then build them for display without having to pay the big bucks of larger models and sets.</p>
