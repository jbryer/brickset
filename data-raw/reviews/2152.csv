"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-19T11:14:41Z","Minis Are Amazing!","This is a huge mini. It is nearly three times larger than the Podracer mini, Anakin's Pod.
The colors are true to the film, however it doesn't open to &quot;deploy&quot; battle droids.
On the bottom are those pieces that are round on the bottom, giving it a floating look. 
All in all, a great set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T08:28:24Z","Sweet, but weres the AAT?????","really cool! but what bugs me the most is that Lego never made any sets to go with this one not even an AAT. the MTT looks really good, franclly better then the large verson. It is really detailed too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-10T21:47:43Z","Wicked","This set is big for a mini but it is great. You can play with it anywhere and it has a better colour scheme then the large one. There is only one problem. It is cool but it lacks in detail and I think it would have been cooler if lego made a mini droid rack to go inside it.But don't let what I wrote stop you buyingthis set it is great fun to build and play with.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:33:16Z","Trade Federation Multi-Troop-Transport!!!","      This is one of my favorite ships! I like the Episode 1 trade federation, so this is a natural get for me! It has the forward blasters for sure, and it uses the good color scheme to capture alot of detail, and it is blocky- just like the real multi troop transport! These things are so robust, I make it challenge the AT-TE mini model! A fun set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-08T21:07:36Z","Great mini","The MTT isn't my favorite Starwars vehicle, but I still love this set. It is a joy to build, doesn't break apart easily, and looks just like the one in the movies. It's sitting in the front row of my mini models collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"reidak49","2007-08-08T13:36:01.427Z","activate the droids","i rember episode 1 when the mtts deployed the droid army this little set was accurate and tough it also had parts for a mini y wing fighter but not all of them this is one of the best minis to bad i took the mtt apart ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Manxboi24","2007-08-18T09:50:38.3Z","Good set","Well, as the title says, it is a good set. It isn't very breakable unlike dome of the other mini sets. It is also pretty accurate to the bigger sets but the circle bit at the front doesn't open, like the bigger sets. One of the main cons of this set is that there are no other mini sets from the Battle of Naboo such as a mini AAT. 
      
Overall :

Plus :
* pretty accurate in appearance
* easy to build
* isn't very breakable

Minus:
* circle bit at the front doesn't open
* no other mini sets from the Battle of Naboo

Overall, I'd give it 6/10",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Leggodt94","2008-07-07T22:35:20.53Z","I guess in this case MTT really stands for Mini Troop Transport","Intrepretating my favorite lego set of all, the mini MTT is a must have for droid fans. It has a lot of detail and has features like bending guns and flap in the back. So with this set, all you have to do is &quot;Activate the Droids!&quot;. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Doek5554","2008-12-23T08:51:37.86Z","Like his Daddy.","This was a cute little set and it looked just like it father, the bigger MTT. There is a little compartment in the back that could hold about one to two studs. It moves smoothy on the floor or carpet with the circles on the bottom.  I wasn't that much of a use for us, but it was fun for a little while.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-17T21:20:04.17Z","And Here We have a Block","Fine, not completely a block, but it is block-like. It has the basic shape of an MTT, but the lack of detail really marks this set down. It has the smooth/round pieces on the bottom to roll it easily across the floor. The back does have the feature of opening, but mine kinda fell apart (fine, it holds together well and I pulled it apart, so what?) and I don't know the correct way it opens, but trust me it opens. The front, sadly, doesn't open, but it's a mini! You can't have everything. It also has the guns on the front, but no big deal.

Overall a good set though the lack of detail does mark it down. But if you don't care about that, then it's fine.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"nasalegojedi","2009-09-01T18:56:49.763Z","A Nice Little Set","I got this a few years ago, and the set is still a delight to build.

Pros: Easy build
Slides along carpet
Small and Sturdy
Very Well detailed
A number of pieces (nearly 100) for a small price

Cons
None!


It is a great little set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-11-08T20:00:54.073Z","MTT Miniset Review","<p>The big draw for me with these mini sets is their pricing and the ability to get several of these sets and create models based on ships from Star Wars without having to spend a lot of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The detail is fairly solid for a miniset and even after having been tossed into a box for storage &amp; moving, I found that it has held together very well and not fallen apart.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-07T11:14:06.773Z","LEGO Star Wars - MTT Review","This is the 4th and last set you need to collect if you want to build the mini y-wing which you can build after you got all 4 mini Star Wars sets you need. The build of this set is very easy and there're also no stickers to worry about. It's a good set for army building and it's also a good set if you want to make a MOC (My own creation) and/or a brickfilm in the future. I can't complain much about it and it's a great little model to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
