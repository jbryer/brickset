"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-22T17:39:30Z","doesn't do much, but looks good","as any other sw mini set, the star destroyer is small, but has enouch details to make it look good, the colour scheme is okay as are the parts used. the overall shape of the completed thing seems to be very accurate, except for one crucial thing: the sloped part in front of the bridge is supposed to be behind the bridge, to create the illusion of the forward bent command tower. You can easily turn around the parts to make it look good, but it's strange lego didn't think of that. overall, this is a cheap way to get an ISD and you can buy a whole fleet of them. an okay set, but you have to change that sloped part to make it look better",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T13:02:02Z","Great Detail","This Mini is way cooler than it looks! The Detail is wonderful! There are four ion cannons on each side (like there are in the movies and in the Starwars games); there are all three shield generators, as there should be (Lego remembered to place the third generator on the bottom); and most importantly (not shown in pic) there are three boosters in the back, which really pleased me as I wasn't expecting it. Don't know what the binocular pieces is supposed to be (a gun obviously, but why?), but it looks good. No special features, but great model. Way out of proportion to the rest of the minis (really, the large star destroyer is more in scale) but nonetheless, a great mini!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-23T15:57:29Z","Mini Star Destroyer!","    If you dont feel like getting the 3 thousand piece juggernaut Star Destroyer UCS model. get the sub-100 piece mini-star desttroyer! It has some fine details and is quite easy to hold! It uses the binocular pieces to act as the main turbo laser battery and uses some nice pieces! It is really quite big and is great to have a mini-collection of mini-models! Asd long as it is Imperial, I lovit!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-08-02T03:20:17Z","Interesting and fun","This is a small version of one of the biggest Lego SW sets! The shape is sleek, looking sufficiently detailed, except for a few minor inaccuracies, like the bridge as mentioned in another review. This set is alot more robust than some of the flimsier minis, plus the alternate model options are endless! A good way to stock up on a variety of pieces in new greys",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"_whateverist","2007-12-15T10:51:22.937Z","Surprisingly good","For a set with such a low brick count and small size, this mini ISD stays impressively close to the movie version. The vessel's shape is accurately reproduced, as are many details you wouldn't think possible at this scale. Granted, some of these require some imagination - the side turbolasers are single studs - but the overall effect is quite convincing.
The construction is sturdy, building up the ship through layers of flat bricks; the finished model is surprisingly heavy and feels built to last.
That said, you are still looking at a very small-scale model, one that can easily be built from the leftover bricks from other sets. In the end, the model feels just a touch too small and under-detailed to justify the price.
If you must have a Lego ISD, by all means get this set; but don't expect too much.

"hustla187","2008-07-25T14:54:14.123Z","One of the Best Minis","This mini is very cool and yet also detailed. There are engines, turrets, the command bridge and so much more that is included in this mini. This Star Destroyer is also pretty cheap so it's a good one to buy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-07-07T22:47:13.06Z","&quot;Impressive! Most Impressive!&quot; - Darth Vader ","This set is by far the biggest mini set yet! It has great detail and is much more enjoyable to build. Although, LEGO could have added some more guns to it, but still it is great! However, this set did not come additional pieces to make another model, but I think that's because more pieces would just buck up the price. Well not much to say now except that minis rock!

"1_for_Legos","2008-12-17T19:54:33.967Z","nice set!","Okay its #1 favorite star wars mini. Its got nice detail, like the binocular piece for a blaster, and the way the head is built. P.S. love the pieces on the back that look like fire to make it look like the ship is flying. THE END.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-17T21:28:10.67Z","The best along with the Millennium Falcon","It's very detailed, to start with. It even has the correct engine positions on the back. There really isn't much to say about it though. It does have an angled bit on the back which you can see in the picture. It also has 4 dark-gray studs which seem to resemble the cannons. The bridge is probably the least detailed part of the model, but it's still a great set. One thing I don't understand though. The binocular piece on the front top is out of place. To my knowledge, there is no gun there, and if it's supposed to add to the slope, it's sticking too far up.
Overall a great set. The detail is nice, and it's just great. If you don't have it, get it. If you already have it and hate it, get it out and use it as a paper weight. That's all the advice I can give.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-12T10:06:33.82Z","LEGO Star Wars - Star Destroyer Review","This set is part of the third wave of the LEGO Star Wars mini sets. This time you won't be able to get some extra pieces to build another mini vehicle after you got all 4 sets for some reason. The build of this model is very simple and quick. The star destroyer looks really cool and it's a very useful set to have if you try to get it for the pieces which you want to use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own creations).<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Firox_5000","2010-09-25T14:48:27.193Z","Great star destroyer set for 2004","<p>This set for 2004 is very good and has lots of great parts. You can only really display it but goes well with other mini sets e.g millenium falcon mini. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course&nbsp; since this came out the much improoved Imperial star destroyer has coem out and is much more realistic however the old one is still pretty good and much reasonable as the new is £35 and the old one is only £7.00. </p>

"AETerry","2012-01-31T16:26:18.147Z","Mini Star Destroyer Review","<p>Living in a Studio Apartment at the time, the mini builds made for easy, economical and space saving ways to get sets of different various Star Wars ships without having to break a budget. I'm enough of a Star Wars fan to enjoy getting these small sets and displaying and moving them around.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Many of these Mini Builds I picked up had plastic containers they came in, which was a bit frustrating on getting home and trying to open them up. <br></p><p>The instructions are in booklet form with clear easy to follow step-by-step illustrations. Where previous Mini Sets had extra pieces for a bonus build when all of them are collected, this one doesn't.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>As a small set, there's a total of 87 making it a good deal for the $6.99 I picked this up at. There's plenty of pieces here for use in other MOCs for those so inclined.<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The build is very solid, even after a year in storage, the vast majority of this set was still together and it took very little to reassemble it.</p><p>And for mini builds, the Star Destroy was able to capture a lot of detail of the larger scale version seen in the movies.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As said before, these mini models make for great economical and space saving ways to get different, various Star Wars sets made of LEGO pieces without having to break a budget. So obviously, if you love the mini builds, this was clearly worth getting. And if you don't like the mini builds, there are always other sets to consider.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,5
"Chills","2012-08-20T19:10:59.887Z","A cool little set, but lacking in design.","<p>I got this set when it came out in 2004, and due to recently moving I've had the opportunity to rebuild it (along with every other set in my collection). Being a mini set there are obvious constraints, detail cannot be as great as with a large set, and the pieces used are also constrained by size. However, this set could have been designed a little better to replicate the awesome Star Destroyer.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1: I do like the different grey tones used in the design. If LEGO used all the same color it would have looked like a small grey blob.<br></li><li>Pro 2: The price was great (even back then). $7 was decent.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1: The design leaves something to be desired. First, the conning tower (bridge tower) looks like its actually on backwards. The back of the tower should be angled, not the front. And the neck should be pretty much vertical in the front and angled in the back. This set has those features opposite, making the tower look backwards.<br></li><li>Con 2: The use of the 45 degree angled plates for the rear also gnaw at me. The designer should have gone with a more shallow angle to reflect the shape of the Destroyer.</li><li>Con 3: Now this is being nit-picky, but even on the underside the set has the inverted dome moved too far forward. It should be closer to the rear.<br></li></ul>
<p>All in all it looks like the designer of the set looked briefly at a couple of Star Destroyer photos and threw this together. There's not much imagination to it and it doesn't do justice to the great ship from the movies. Comparing it to the small Destroyer from 10221 I have to say I like that version much better than this one. But if you're like me and must have every version of the Star Destroyer you should pick this up.<br></p>",TRUE,2,3,3,4,4
