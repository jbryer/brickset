"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-05T09:06:54Z","Struggles","This is not an easy prototype to make in Lego as it is basically smooth and as we know Lego is not. This is a mini they needn't have bothered with in my view - especially as it hardly appears in the movie. It is a poor representation of the prototype, but good (albeit expensive) source of plates and hinges and I have bought a few for parts - especially as they are in the new shades. I wouldn't bother unless you need the parts.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:35:29Z","Mysterious Ship!","   The Sith Infiltrator always has caught my eyes! You never get to truly see it in full action, which I am sure a Sith battleship would be quite powerful, but the mini model is a fine way to have it. It looks like an imperial ship with the colors and TIE-ish wing pylons! I make it fight the Jedi Starfighter and X-wings and stuff, a little time twisted but oh well!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-07-07T22:40:07.107Z","Unexpected ","The fact that LEGO would make a mini out of darth maul's ship is sort of unexpected considering that it wasn't seen much in the phantom menace, but whatever; it's cool anyway. With featurs like opening flap in the back, bendable landing gear and wings, darth maul can reak havoc on any system in the galaxy until he dies at the end, of course. Great set! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-12T10:13:24.447Z","LEGO Star Wars - Sith Infiltrator Review","This sith infiltrator set is part of the third wave of the LEGO Star Was mini collection. It's a fun and simple little model but for some reason these sets which came out in the 3rd wave don't have any pieces to build an extra mini vehicle after you collected all 4 (sets 4492, 4493, 4494 and 4495). This set is very sturdy and we don't get any stickers to worry about. This model is very useful if you want to get some pieces for MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
