"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-15T00:30:24Z","Gotta Love it","Probley the second best of the new minis(The best one is the star destroyer). I glad its white and not grey it looks so much better white. As far as size goes its as big as the falcon mini. I think its it got really high play abillity. Its got the landing stands under neath it. And when it comes in to land the wings can fold up like the big one. Worth getting if you like minis.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-05T08:59:28Z","Simply the best","As you know I like accuracy and this has to be the best  of all the minis - it looks and works exactly like the prototype with its folding wings which also work. Cockpit is printed and the rest is just really clever and a good source of parts. I can't really say any more, apart from I'll give it 10. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-28T07:44:17Z","Nice...BUT","Nice miniature although not entirely true to reality. As I'm a big Star Wars fan, I have to be a bit critical about this set: Lambda class shuttles do not have additional gun pods attached on top of their wings...
Overall a fun build an great addition to my mini collection. See also:

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T01:45:52Z","This is one of the best mini's","I love this mini. I 100% agree with what Captain Yorr (Imperial co-pilot) said I I agree with other raters that this is one of the best. I got this set today and it is really fun to play with. It has good detials on the cockpit for a mini and it has great wing detail as well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:37:10Z","Very Nice Shuttle!","       This ship is extremely nice! It has some nice details and uses the best color cheme! It lacks the small stuff but uses binoculars as gun turrets up front!  I like this ship and you can make it be for any faction, rebels, imperial, republic, CIS! It isa  cool set to own.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-02T13:38:54.497Z","Good builted mini","This mini set of the Star Wars theme was released in 2004. Like all the other mini, this is a replica of the normal sized sets but in a mini size. As a mini set, this Imperial Shuttle not includes minifigures. The building is basic, in the base, front and wings. Altough the buiding is simple, this is very good and the wings on each side works very well. Like some other mini, this have some details that combined with the original color scheme, makes the set better. Some pieces like the small white plates and the pieces that makes the wings moves are really useful. As a mini set, this have a simple playability with no minifigures, but good for a mini set. Overall, the building and details makes this set a nice set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-13T10:06:19.89Z","LEGO Star Wars - Imperial Shuttle Review","This is a LEGO Star Wars mini set which came out with the third wave of the LEGO Star Wars mini collection. For some reason you don't get extra pieces which you can use to build an extra model. It's a very simple build and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. I think it's a good model to have. Even if you look for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (my own creations) and brickfilms it's a great set to get for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Yankeesboy08","2010-05-22T08:57:20.967Z","My first set.......EVER! And one of the best too!","This was my first lego set ever. It was a very supportive set. The only problem was was that the wings almost always fell off. Other than that, this set was a great set. I just wish I could find the pieces to this set to put it back together!<div><br></div><div>Play experience 5/5: This set was fun to play with for hours if you had the mini x-wing. You could always open and close the wings to make it land</div><div><br></div><div>Parts 4/5: There are many good parts in this set. I thought the cockpit piece was very well done. The only problem was the antenna guns on the wings. I thought the yellow pieces made the set look very good.</div><div><br></div><p>Building 5/5: I thought the build of this set was a very good one. Building the top fin was the most fun part. Connecting the wings to the base was also fun. Connecting the head was also fun.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall 4/5: Even though there were a few downsides to this set, it was my first set and one of the greatest.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
