"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-05T08:53:24Z","A few bugs","This is one of the minis that tries hard, but does not quite get there. The legs are the main problem as they are restricted in movement and as a result the set can only really be dispalyed successfully with them in one position - as shown in the picture. The middle pair in particular cannot be moved backwards or forwards. The front cockpit area is cleverly done, with the correct colours, and the large projectile cannon is more accurately located further back on the body than on the large version 4482 and can also correctly be elevated (but not turned) so in that respect this set is good. The main armour is 4 elongated Bricks thankfully printed to achieve the detail, but it would have been better if these had been handed for each side as it is back to front on the one side. Not a bad little set I suppose.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T23:39:18Z","The Enforcer is back again!","      I like the Republic's powers, but I also love the Imperials. This has every gun that this ship has. Ball-turret front and back guns, main energy laser and crew shot! It uses some nice pieces to serve as armor plating and it a very big model! It is good to assist the Gunshiups to bring piece throughout the galaxy for the REpublic! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"brickbuster2409","2007-03-27T16:51:56.6Z","who said sets have to be big to be fun?","i think this is one of the best sets out of the mini series.  i find it to be one of the most accurate out of the original size sets.  the cockpit is the most accurate part of the set and is done cleverly.  i think the cannon on top is a bit oversized to be part of a mini, but still works with it.  a great way to start your republic army.

"Manxboi24","2007-08-13T13:12:44.91Z","Could be better","Although I really like Republic walkers, I find this set disappointing. The legs aren't great for moving the AT-TE, especially the side legs. On the plus side, I like the cannon on top of the AT-TE. The pieces on the side are pretty good but not perfect.
    Overall, I give it a 6/10",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2008-01-25T23:27:37.937Z","mini-bug","This thing looks like the bigger one, and it is so realistic, i think the top gun should swivel around, but the middel legs are turned in a funny way. I don't know why they made this minis set, but this stuff is pretty good. I do not reccommend this to people however, it is not worth the money",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-14T14:05:36.793Z","Mini AT-TE","This is another Star Wars set, released in the mini size, in the year of 2004. Like some Mini, this is a nice small replica of the original big vehicles. As a mini set, this AT-TE features small plates and blocks making the details and don't includes the minifigures. As base, some blocks are used, and also some with encurved shapes. The front features a green piece, well positioned, and still fixed. The &quot;paws&quot; are well made, altough cannot moves for the sides, and are basically simple landing gears for the bigger sets, because are the better to make it looks like original. Above these, are some encurved blocks with printed details and too, a stick, used as the cannon of the AT-TE, and it really looks like it. On the back, some gray pieces above the &quot;paws&quot;, makes another cool effect for this mini set, due to the shape and details. Altough this is a mini set, this is well made and the playability is decent, it looks like the original and have a cool design and color scheme. The set overall includes useful 63 pieces, so, it is another cool replica of a Star Wars vehicle in mini size.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2008-06-29T19:35:19.95Z","Cute Little Beetle  =) ","I don't own any at-te models (yet), so I was really wanting this set for a while. Eventually, I got it, and I loved it! There's just something that's so interesting about mini sets. Maybe the fact that LEGO can take one of their biggest models and shrink it down to mini size with all the detail still packed inside. It's just incredible! Anyways, this set has cool little features like, bendable guns and cannon on top, posable leggs, and rare clear green pieces and that's about it. Cool set! :D  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-13T10:21:40.827Z","LEGO Star Wars - AT-TE Review","This simple model is also part of the third wave of the LEGO Star Wars mini sets. It's a fun and simple build but for some reason you won't be able to find any extra pieces which you can use to build a mini vehicle. This is a great little model to have - even if you're looking for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
