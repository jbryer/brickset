"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-25T01:29:02Z","Lots of bricks and quite a few plates. A few slopes/inverted slopes, too.","When LEGO&#174; Shop At Home had a 30%-50% off sale, I bought USD $229.81's worth of bricks, plates, roof tiles, a few specialty items, and 2 buckets (4028 and 4105) and these 2 tubs (4496 and 4497). The tubs and buckets were not on sale. They were USD $19.99 and USD $9.99, respectively
When I opened the tubs, I found out the only differences between the 2 sets is the container: 4496 is blue, 4497 is red, and has different pictures on each side. The instructions/idea book is also the same, exept for the size: The i/i book in 4496 is 5-7/8&quot; wide x 8-7/32&quot; high.
book in 4497 is 5-7/32&quot; wide x 7-7/16&quot; high.
OK, now, the bricks:

The Tub:
Stackable? Yes.
Snap-on lid? There's a small snap on each end, it reguires about a pound of force to lift the lid straight up (guessing). A test with the tub about 1/3 full of bricks, letting it fall off the edge of a dining table onto a carpeted floor showed that the lid will not stay on.

Big enuff to store models in?
Outside tub dimentions:
14-3/4&quot; long x 10-3/4&quot; wide x 8-1/4&quot; high.
Inside tub dimentions:
12-3/4&quot; long x 8-3/4&quot; wide, at the bottom, and 7-1/8&quot; deep, lid adds another 1/2&quot; to the depth.

When deciding between 4496 and 4497, ask yourself, &quot;Which color tub do I want? Blue or red? As far as the bricks go, they're both the same&quot;

Overall, it's a good deal, at USD 2 cents a brick, you cant beat it.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-17T10:54:08Z","Not in Holland!!!","Thanks for the list scott, your review made me deside to buy this tub. Although the lego site mentions this set is not available in the Netherlands, I just bought a box at the local drugstore (they sell some other items, sometimes including lego). Per part I paid 2,5 eurocent 
(about 2,5 usdcent). A very nice x-mas gift. Now I have to decide wether or not I'm gonna buy another set before the sale is over!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-17T14:06:27Z","Not in Holland? Shame on You, TLC!","I've bought it also at the drugstore in Holland. And this time they had a great storage. Two times herefore I was too late and all the boxes were saled in one day.
It has much common colours and lime-green, light-blue and new light gray bricks.
It's a great entreprise to sort all these bricks, but I like it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-05T12:23:40.217Z","Good set lots of unusual color bricks and pieces","Set costs around 20 USD but worth it considering how many bricks and the different colors and pieces included in this tub.  Will add some colors to your building options - great gift to get someone into the LEGO world.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"william_gardner2017","2020-02-09T04:25:57.3Z","Many Fond Memories of this Set","<p>Alright lets begin. This is the set that got me into Lego. When I was 2, my parents bought me this 1000 piece set. At first, I did not know what to do with it, since, well I was 2. But after a few days, I began to realise&nbsp;what I could do with all the pieces. I&nbsp;loved it. The set definitely opened my imagination of what I could build. Looking back at this set 16 years later, from my personal experience, I can tell that it was a great starter!&nbsp;The box contained very basic and simple pieces (that are also crucial), like the 2x2 or the 2x4. The box also gave a great assortment of colours to choose from. An instruction manual is included and gives small projects to build. There is really nothing much else to discuss about this set other that I still use all of its pieces in projects. Would recommend for younger people and older people alike.&nbsp;</p>
