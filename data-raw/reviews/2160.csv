I love that it comes with a snow trooper they have the best uniform and make great army men.  this set is so cool and looks as though it would go great with the AT-AT.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-28T04:03:00Z","Nice Set!","Just finished this set and I must say it's pretty good. Fantastic details, especially for a system set. Nice use of orange bricks for color highlights and coll to include the grapling hook. The only downside is the windshield, which is a little too flimsy for my tastes. Compared to the older system Snowspeeder (7130), this set is very much similar. Differences are the use of white instead of light grey and a different laser cannon. However, the 7130 is a more solid set.

Overall a good set with improved details.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-11T02:56:12Z","Excellent little set!","First of all, this snowspeeder is a vast improvement over the old 7130 set. The basic items are the same, Snowspeeder, Luke, Dack, Rebel Snow Trooper, laser cannon, but there is more detail to the ship and is more representative of the vehicle in the movie. The build is fairly easy, and when completed, is fairly solid. Improvements include a grappling hook &amp; winch, better details on the rear and wings, and a better cockpit and canopy. The colors are much better, using white with black and orange accents. The re-inclusion of a laser cannon is nice, but I prefer the 7130 laser cannon, it just looks better. Finally, this ship is just great to play with! You can fly it around the room or even hook something with the grappling hook and drag it around! 

Overall, an excellent set. This set is a great value - 212 pcs for $20.00. It's very playable and just looks fantastic. A highly recommended buy for any Lego fan and a must for any Star Wars collector!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The cockpit is huge compared to some big sets where you have no space! The great update on the previous version is the harpoon. Only thing you need now ar 2 more AT-ATs and there you go re-creating the battle of Hoth.

there is one thing a don't like about it, it's the way the windows are fixed on th structure. you can't open the cockpit without ripping the whole thing of. But this is only a detail, until you really play with it, this won't be anoying.

You get 3 awesome figs, Luke Skywalker, Dak Ralter, and a rebel soldier (I think the brown visor would have been better than goggles). The speeder is nice and holds the typical control plate with an ATAT on it. It is a two seater, which I enjoy alot! It does come with a &quot;harpoon cannon&quot; which is the average string with a 3 hooked grappler attached! I like the white color scheme better than the older greyish one, but it could just be me! The blaster cannons are alot better than the old ones but these are harder to put together! The canopy is  nice but I like the stealthy air-engines. It has a good new maintanance plate. The speeder looks awesome and is a great adder to your collection and it is quite small, so it is easy to play with, so playability is an A+! The snow soldier has his own battery to man. Its the anti-vehicle laser turret. The older one had the better dish but I like that it can aim anywhere, up and down, left or right! This is a great model for only 20 USD.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-05T22:31:55Z","Excellent!","I picked this set up a little after my birthday, and it has the honor of being one of the few sets that's stayed together for this long!  I usually dismantle my sets for parts, especially Star Wars sets.  This, however, has survived completely, apart from a few minor mishaps.

The construction is wonderful.  It is sturdy and swoosh-able, plus I love how it looks, I think it captured the Snowspeeder &quot;feel&quot; very well.  

Cons have been noted by others, so I will not state them here.

The only thing I think is a major inconsistency(apart from what bricks just can't do)was the coloring.  No, I'm NOT talking about the white/grey issue.  I think it looks better, and truer to the film, in white.  However, with the inclusion of the Luke and Dak minifigs, the orange highlights should have been grey!  In the movie, all the Speeders had orange highlights EXCEPT Luke Skywalker's Speeder, which had grey higlights!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-22T18:16:40Z","Wowee! Fast model!"," Okay, first, I would like to thank the Lego company for finally designing the proper snowspeeder. This one has the best mini-figs imaginable. The Traditional Luke head (My Personal Favorite Above All), an ordinary smiley face that is supposed to play Dak Ralter from the movie, and a cool scarlet haired frowny guy who place an Alliance snow soldier of something of the catregory. 

 The set is cool, easy to build. I thank the lego team for throwing in two orange suits and the good helmets. The laser guns are replaced by newer, longer, more realistic looking ones. I charish the two seater lego model. The harpoon cannon is sortof flimsy but is a regular string attached to the more reliable three-tonged hook. It is kindof funny seeing the &quot;harpoon gun&quot; as a camera piece, but what else could they have done? The cramped cabin has the worst control display ever, just a big control screen that shows a large AT-AT on it, but this can be easily replaced. The good canopy is used here and I just love that. Better than the standard squarish one used in the city center sets. The speeder's wings are attached to the cntral fuselage by gears, so they are very reliable. This set is at a good price (19.99 USD). The set also comes with a some sort of laser AA gun for the soldier to man. The soldier has a neat torso with tan pants and a toppy helmet (White) with white goggles replacing the brown visor from the past set.

So, right into it-this set is really cool. I've always liked the Snowspeeder from Star Wars, and when they came out with it in Lego, I was pretty excited. I had to look for it all over, though, finally finding it at a Target, along with the X-Wing Fighter, which will be my next review.

Pros:
Cool design
Realistic guns
NO STICKERS FOR THE WIN! gah! I hate like sitckers!
3 minifigs, very good number for a set this size
Brakes and tow cannon/cable included, which could have easily been overlooked and made for a bad set
Perfect scale and nice inclusion of the Star Wars cockpit element
Even includes a turret or satellite interceptor dish whatever it is, and a rebel soldier minifig!

Some cons:
Luke's lightsaber must be slid under his arm in the vehicle for a place to keep it, which gives him less ""elbow room"" and greatly deludes the ""play"" feature of this set

Also, Dack Ralter is a little too far back in the aft position in the back, perhaps the seat could have been made a little farther down?

I got it for my mum who had gone on a holiday ( she had introduced me to StarWars ). At first I had no idea who the guys were and what the laser turret did or was. It didn't take me long to figure it out.

Snowspeeder. This set is seriously excellent. The weight is perfect, the size is perfect, EVERYTHING is perfect. The wings, so detailed, great use of bricks, NO STICKERS! The cock pit, perfect amount of space, nice control panel, NO STICKERS! I could go on, and on, and on about this set, but fortunately I can't. =( Another thing I really like is the fact that on the wings there are a lot of really good pieces used, like the orange and white slanted pieces, the small tubes used for the blasters and the flappy paddles used for steering. A great set.

The Turret. The very fist time I made this turret I thought it was a satellite used for communication. It broke. A few months later I saw the film and discovered that this turret was no satellite, I ended up rebuilding it. It actually looks really cool, I'm using it for a turret in my base that I have constructed.

Minifigures. The minifigures in this set are awesome! I especially like the rebel trooper. Luke and Dak are also cool with their pilot gear.

Fortunately this set is pretty old so I would say ""Buy this set, it's a great buy"" but many of you won't be able to.

That Christmas, I got it. Sadly, after a while, it disassembled and I couldn't find the pieces. But, 3 years later, in Christmas 2010, I got it again. It still had the essence it had 3 years ago. This time, I'll take better care of it. First I'll review the minifigures, then the speeder.</p>
<p>First we have Luke Skywalker. He has his original face before they switched to the more serious one. He has standard&nbsp;star wars&nbsp;pilot uniform. He has the helmet most LEGO Star Wars pilots have, but he has his trademark one with the red logos I can't describe. He comes with his blue lightsaber.</p>
<p>Now his partner in the speeder, Dan Ralter. Dan has the same uniform as Luke. His helmet is the same as Luke's too, except the logos are blue. He has the basic smiley face, so he can be Dan Ralter or just ""pilot guy"".</p>
<p>Then we have our snow trooper. He has my favorite LEGO head, the smiley with the printed red hair and one triangular eyebrow. He has standard snow trooper uniform. He has the larger blaster. He has a helmet with goggles. His cannon, spins 360o and has a handle he can hold on.</p>
<p>Now, the snowspeeder. It has two wings, equipped with cannons, at a limited&nbsp;angle. The wings also have flaps on them, probably used for adjusting air resistance. There is a part on the side of the cockpit where Luke can put his lightsaber. The windshield opens up, But only from the front. So to remove Dan, who sits in the back, you must remove the windshield, too. In the back, there is a grapling hook, used for tripping ATAT and ATST walkers, but if you don't have walkers, you can use it for rescuing&nbsp;stranded troopers, too.</p>
<p>All in all, this is Lego's best snowspeeder. I reccomend you get it. 5/5</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5

","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>&nbsp;I own the original of this set, so once I saw the new design I had to purchase it. The new and improved look made the old look.....well old. :) The pieces hold intact all the time and this set doesn't disappoint little kids (experience). A great buy.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"stoneboys","2011-02-20T08:59:59.063Z","the description of awsomeness","&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the BEST star wars set ever! It comes with yellow minifigs(which I personaly like better than tan) and a descently cheap set with Luke Skywalker. The speeder has to be the best part about this set. It comes with detail not to much but some and its accurate to the movie(unlike the first one which was gray for some reason). The only problem with this set is Luke and Dac don't fit in their seats well its hard to get them positioned right. Overall if you can find this set BUY IT! I promise you you wont regret getting it.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"DDenissssss","2012-10-17T12:59:37.04Z","Interesting set","<p>When I was 8, I was incredibly happy and excited when realized that this speeder has 2 pilots. I didn't like the guns and made them like in 7130. The construction is&nbsp;easy, but&nbsp;has a lot of interesting parts and minifigures are very good. My passion is collecting rebel helmets, and here you get Luke's helmet with red signs and&nbsp;Dack's helmet with blue signs. Also you get rebel trooper with ion cannon and if you have an AT-AT, you can have an exciting Hoth battle, because this speeder has also a harpoon.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2015-01-10T17:45:50.823Z","Could be better, but still fun to play with.","<p>In the year 2003, LEGO surprised and delighted fans of Star Wars by releasing 4483 Imperial AT-AT - the kind of set most fans were sure they could only dream about. But... there was something a bit lacking to the fun. Lego&#39;s set of the Snowspeeder, 7130, was from 1999 and its production run had already ended. Besides that, while it looked well enough it did not have a winch to serve as a functioning towcable - no tripping up AT-ATs for it! So in 2004, Lego released a new Snowspeeder set for the buying public, one that sought to improve on the 1999 original.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a nice blue color, and depicts the snowspeeder swooshing in front of screenshots from Empire Strikes Back. Fairly straightforward, and it does look like something out of the movie. The instructions are nicely comprehensible, though they do show the start of an amusing trend; Lego switched to the new bluish grays in 2004... but the instructions still depict the old grays.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a nice selection of parts present, primarily white. While some of the parts are questionable choices for the snowspeeder and turret themselves (as well as there being a color issue), they are all fairly useful pieces for other building purposes. The set includes some nice greebling tiles: Two standard 1x2 Star Wars greebling tiles in light blay, and two white 2x2 tiles with a new greebling pattern.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes a bog standard yellow-face Pilot Luke, pretty much the same as all the others up to that point - the only change being the hips going from dark gray to dark blay. Included to go with Luke is his ill-fated gunner, Dak Ralter. Dak&#39;s helmet is just an off-the-peg Rebel helmet with blue crests - no custom markings. His face is the good ol&#39; Classic Lego Smiley Face, so his minifig is easy to repurpose. Like Luke, he&#39;s identical to the 1999As with 7130 (which it&#39;s basically a remake of) this set includes a third minifig - a Rebel soldier in cold-weather garb and armed with a news camera serving as a large blaster rifle. He has a further difference compared to his 1999 counterpart than just the switch to the bluish grays: Where the 1999 figure stuck a standard visor on an aviator&#39;s helmet to try and capture the brim of of the rebel helmets, this version chooses to portray the protective goggles instead. He was definitely the real prize in this set - he and his 1999 version were the only Rebel soldiers Lego had produced at the time.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a straightforward process, and fun to do. There are some definite clever tricks employed in the construction. As with 4483, this set takes the unusual track of building the smaller secondary model last rather than first.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a mixed bag for me as far as the snowspeeder itself goes. The presence of the rear grille, the engine at the back of each wing... These are very solid, definite improvements on the design from 7130. The winch and grapnel used to provide a working tow cable are a lovely play feature that the original set was lacking and all the more welcome thanks to the existence of an AT-AT set.</p>

<p>But with the good comes bad:</p>

<ul>
	<li>There&#39;s one inaccuracy it shares with 7130 and with a lot of depictions of Luke&#39;s snowspeeder in general: The orange markings of Zev Senesca&#39;s snowspeeder instead of the proper dark gray. Evidently, people have taken the scene of Zev&#39;s search for Luke and Han to be the only reference they need for snowspeeders. And then there&#39;s a color issue it shares with every X-Wing set Lego has made since 7140/7142: It&#39;s white where it should be gray (while Zev&#39;s speeder does look white in some of the long shots of the search scene, other shots and all the shots during the battle show the snowspeeders are gray), and this has carried over to subsequent snowspeeder sets as well.</li>
	<li>The 3x12 wing plates give too shallow of an angle to the outside edges of the wings on this set, and seem to have been chosen to add build complexity more than anything else. The cannons, while an interesting and fun build, aren&#39;t very accurate. It&#39;s telling that in the subsequent snowspeeder sets, Lego went back to the 6x12 wing plates and the laser cannon bricks.</li>
	<li>The turret is &quot;meh&quot; compared to the one from 7130. The brick base of this rendition looks like an effort from the days before articulated minifigures, and if Lego was only going to use one 6x6 dish rather than two, they should have stuck with the webbed one since it captures the look better on its own than does a blank solid dish.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While this set does have some annoying flaws, it does have its good qualities. There&#39;s plenty of play value in it, it includes a Rebel soldier, and like its predecessor it was decently priced at $20. It was also the last snowspeeder to not be part of a bigger, more expensive set until 2015 - and the 2015 set, despite being about the same size, is priced at $30 and adds insult to injury by replacing the Rebel soldier with snowtroopers. (Seriously, first the 2013 battlepacks decide &quot;LOL we no need Rebels lets make a battlepack from teh stupid MMORPG that craps on people who played KOTOR instead&quot; and now this... ). If you can find it for an okay price and with the Rebel soldier, I&#39;d still say go for it. If you decide you like another snowspeeder set better, there&#39;s plenty of other ways to use its parts (maybe even upgrades for 7130?).</p>
