"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-27T12:54:19Z","I love this set!","Many people are whining about how small the Cantina is, but this is an awesome set!  It comes some new minifigs: Greedo and a sandtrooper.  It also comes with a pretty cool dewback.  Although small, the cantina is functional and actually comes with a mug for drinking and a tap for pouring juri juice.  You can make a cool bartender out of existing minifig parts.  I really liked the landspeeder that came with the set.  It is more to scale than the first one.  I had to pretty much rebuild my original, but this one is awesome.  The coloring is also more realistic.  The set as a whole, merits a 10 for play value and elements alone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-27T18:03:09Z","Cantina is cool!","Okay, I did receive it from the States, and builded it.  First of all let me say that Greedo is one of the coolest Star Wars minifigs ever!  He even got his arms printed (like Boba in the Cloud City set).  Cool!  Okay the Land speeder is more detailed than the previous version.  Weird colors I think and when compared to the cantina it looks kinda large.
The cantina is cool!  I do like the color of the bricks.  Looks nice I think, and you'll get a table where Han and Boba are sitting.  Under the table Han's gun is hidden.  Only problem I have with it is that it is way too small!  Okay, compared price/bricks it is an okay set, but it would have been nicer I think if they left out the speeder and made the cantina bigger...I do like the set a lot though.
The last one is the Dewback with Sand Trooper.  Wow!  This is also very cool!  Looks great!  It is so detailed and complete!  Very nice!
Rating!  I like the cantina a lot, and also the Sand Trooper and Dewback.  The speeder is a nice addition, but not really my thing.  7/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Sure it comes with a Desert Stormtrooper, a dewback, Greedo, Han, Luke, and Ben but for $30 USD I thought it was way overpriced. The set could have had a bigger cantina with maybe some band people too.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-18T03:23:23Z","Pricey, but worth it","I love this little set. As has already been stated, it's a very little set for a big price, but I'll state here that the price is justifiable based on the retail value of rare lego elements. The visible sparseness of the set, so expertly masked by striking box art, goes right along with Lego's emerging bare essentials design trend.

GOOD

Minifigs: Great way to get Han, farmboy, the elusive Jedi Mentor Kenobie, a stormtrooper, and the incredibly detailed Greedo alien. The unlucky alien is in prime shape with a head molded to detail worthy of a Hasbro figure. 

Speeder: Hop in with Luke as he races across desert wastelands to strike a deal in the iffy recesses of Mos Eisley spaceport and still make it home for dinner in time!

Sandtrooper and Dewback: Equivalent blurb; awesome element of the Imperial army.

BAD

Minifigs: The lack of them. Here's explaining the bare-essential design trend. Lego picked a fan-favorite scene to model, then figured who is necessary in the scene, and only figured them. Han shoots Greedo right before he strikes the deal with Luke and Obi. Sure, I'm not going to write here and grumble that they didn't make a Bith Band player minifig, but consider who was missing from this party: Bartender, Chewbacca, 3P0&amp;R2. These have all been figged, except of course for the bartender, which involves painting up an Anakin fig. 

Size of the Cantina:
Only thing in the set that's too small. Figures; they skimp on the title element. Well, as I said earlier, they only give you what you really need. I definately agree with the previous review that suggested there ought to be a larger $100 or even $50 Cantina set to fill out this one. For now, I've put together my own using spare walls and the figs from the Community Workers set.

Price:
Thirty bucks hurts for a small Cantina, more so since the set is supposed to be the cantina. But I'll argue here that the price makes perfect sense when you take into account everything in the set besides the Cantina. My breakdown in defense of the Lego Company follows:

Dewback w/Sandtrooper: $10 retail value
Updated speeder w/Luke&amp;Obi: $10
Cantina:
    Walls, Han, Greedo
    Greedo: $5 retail value (at least)
    
So at most, this set is overpriced by $5. Lego also got $10 apiece from us for the Yoda and Dooku set, so comparatively this just barely makes sense. 

So I give this thing an 8 for great pieces and lots of play value, but not delivering exactly on the scene it advertises.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-11T11:30:06Z","Little Cantina but Great Detail","OK, had to buy one for my son who wanted it just for the dewback. The set is really three in one (cantina, speeder, and dewback). CANTINA: although a nice combination of colors and nicely detailed, it's more of a back-drop for the Greedo/Han shoot-out. This part should be a prelude or introduction to a much larger cantina in Bespin fashion that it can be added to. I still think it's the neatest little alcove, just not much more. I esp. like the colors, the double-arched entry way, and the clear mug and tap.
SPEEDER: best Lego speeder I have seen. Great detail, love the colors and the unique idea to curve the two flexible pieces in the front. The speeder does look much larger than the cantina when side-by-side but one can fault the speeder because of the small cantina.
DEWBACK: excellent. I love the sand-trooper with pack on back and the rod that he holds. Great utilization of just a few pieces but very nicely done for detail. The dewback is basically dinosaur parts with a new head but looks great.
FIGS: Greedo head is the most detailed SW head I've seen.  These are how Lego should make all the alien heads instead of single-color molds. The other figs esp. trooper are also nicely done.
OVERALL, the set is very specialized in pieces, much too expensive for what you get (should be no more than $20), but the detail is outstanding.  I would rate higher if the price was less and the cantina a little larger, but still, the set is unique and a must have for the Lego SW collector.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Buy the set for the AWESOME dewback and sandtrooper. Amazing what Lego did with the trooper. Amazing, too, is the up-to-scale landspeeder. It is extremely ACCURATE also in design and color. The minifig head for Greedo is extremely accurate as well! By far it is the best SW Lego head!!!

The disappointment in this set is the cantina. It's a little too small, although I like the little alcove for Han and Greedo to exchange words and to shoot a little (Han's blaster is hidden underneath the table).

This set was selling for around $30, however. $30?! I can almost buy my own (real) cantina for that!

to those who say the cantina is great, I say no. It is too small, there isn't even the bar and the bartender, wich lego could at least have added, ot just something to make it look a little more like a bar. At least they chose the exciting scene from the movie.

I love the uniform of the imperials. It comes with a stormtrooper(Yipee)! I love these babies but the helmet had some bad paint job. The reptilian dewback is wesome and the storm trooper rodes its back with binoculars and a long pole or something. I wish the stormy had a blaster! Han looks great, this is the cheapist set you can get him in and he looks too cool. He comes with a blaster pistol that is under the cantina table so he can fry Greedo. Han will fly the falcon and x-wing when I get it for x-mas! 

Okay, the landspeeder is awesome. So much better than the old one. 
Instead of using little curved bricks for the front, it used the neat beending bars that act like little rails. You get the Luke head too and i luv that one! Obi Wan kenobi is also included with a good head and a cool grey hairpiece. The speeders has a little trunk that can hold luke's light saber (Pretty keen!). 

The cantina is really neat but it is way too small to actually pretend it is the real thing. Greedo is soooo detailed and it looks great!!

Lego Shop At Home themselves have it on back order, so I am really pleased to have found it.

The detail is just amazing and although fair enough, the cantina itself is quite small, the landspeeder and dewback more than make up for it along with the good range of cool figures.  The stormtrooper looks lush and is stunningly detailed too.  Don't forget everything that you are getting.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-04T13:21:17Z","Not bad - at half the price","I have resisted this set for some time believing it to be too expensive – I decided I would bide my time. Finally my patience has been rewarded as this week my local toy store were having a half price sale on certain Lego items, and this set just happened to be one of them –so it only cost me 15 GBP. It is a good set if only for the Speeder, Dewback and Greedo and Sandtrooper Minifigs. The Speeder is far superior to the previous offering – larger and more accurate colours. I agree the long thin tubes used to make the front are difficult to keep in place whilst adding the top plates, but perseverance worked. I tried them the next day when the springiness had gone out of them and they had begun to take on the correct shape and they were a lot easier to remove and replace. I have enhanced mine with a 3PO Minifig sitting on the back.  Sandtrooper with his orange cape (or back pack as you can't have both at once) looks great on the Dewback - which could have had the end of the tail joint done better without leaving a gap – after all this is supposed to be an animal! Cantina is made from not many parts and the least inspiring part of this set for me – I confess mine went straight into the parts box unmade. As a result of the reduced price I can give this set a 9 – I know it contains unique parts, but so does the Enzo Ferrari 8652 – which as you will see from my reviews I did not feel was overpriced.

Whilst I am complaining about the high price of Lego, I must mention, as have others in the past, that I feel it is unfair that in the UK Lego prices appear to be the same in GBP as they are US Dollars. With the current exchange rate heading towards 2 Dollars to the Pound how can Lego justify charging us in the UK nearly twice as much as those in the US for the same thing, and sleep at night?

The sandtrooper on the dewback is 75% of the reason I got this because sandtroopers on dewbacks are always awesome. Greedo makes up another 20% cos Greedo's Greedo and everybody loves Greedo. Han, Luke and Obi are nice since I didn't have these particular ones, rounding out the remaining 5%. The rest of the bricks sit unmade inside the box.

"AFOSL","2009-04-03T14:58:28.717Z","A Good Set That Falls At The Last Hurdle","I remember vaguely when this set first came out.  Many people were very disappointed for a few reasons.  Number one was cost.  Yes, this set was quite expensive at the time for the number of parts included in the over sized box.  Less than 200 pieces for almost £30.00 was poor - still is a poor price to piece ratio.
Many people compared this to some of the dinosaur sets at the time.  Those kits had a similar number of pieces, and similar pieces (animal body parts) to the cantina set but were retailing for a much lower price.
I dare say licensing costs and demand for Star Wars kits helped push up the price, not to mention the new molds created exclusively for this kit at the time.
The new Dewback was considered a must have and was very sought after.  It's a good mold although the tail has a small attatchment piece which unfortunately shows, leaving a small gap in the tail.  The Dewback is one colour - sand green - one of the range of muted colours used by Lego for the Star Wars line of kits.  A saddle and Stormtrooper mounted on it's back complete the look.  

The Stormtrooper has some additions such as the back pack/breathing apparatus, the long lance, probably used to keep the Dewback in line, and the orange pauldron on his shoulder, denoting that this Stormtrooper is the head honcho of his detatchment on desert detail.  The pauldron is a nice attention to detail and is made from the same material as the capes found on some other figures like Darth Vader and Jedi, etc...

The other piece that certainly helped sell this kit, despite it's low parts count, is the all new Greedo minifigure.  This minifigure is one of the best Lego have ever produced and shows attention to detail.
The head is a brand new mold in what appears to be a unique colour - green turquoise.  I certainly haven't seen this colour elsewhere in the Star wars line up.
The Rodian head mold is complete with all over pimples, mohawk spines, pointy ears, antenna, big eyes and elongated snout.  The eyes are painted black with white centers to depict light reflections, and the snout also has a little paintwork added.  The torso has been painted with beige and blue turquoise, even the arms have been painted on this figure.  That kind of detail was last seen by me on the Boba Fett figure included with the Cloud City set.
Greedo is a very impressive figure and for me, the best part of this set.

Other figures included are Luke Skywalker in Tatooine garb, Ben Kenobi without hood and cape and Han Solo with dark blue legs, sporting a belt and holster.
Figures missing, in my opinion, are: 3P0, R2 and Chewie.  The addition of these may have softened the blow for those complaining about the price of the set.

Moving on to the last details.  Luke's speeder is very good.  It is much more detailed than the previous speeder from 1999, and more scale like in appearance, being longer and wider than the previous incarnation.  It is also of the correct colours, once again using the muted sand colours in it's construction - dark red, purple(?) complementing the two shades of grey that are also used.  The only tan pieces on this kit are used for the hinge for the opening compartment at the back of the speeder.  It's a really nice and well thought out model which makes a bit of a mockery of it's predecessor.

Moving on to the cantina itself, if that is what you can call it.  This is what really gave the fans something to grumble about.  The cantina is not a cantina as such, but just the little booth where Han sat as he talked to Luke and Ben, before blowing away poor old Greedo in the movie.
The booth is tiny, although well constructed, using two tan  quarter cylinder pieces for walls to give it that Tatooine sand crafted shape and look.  Two different types of tan archway pieces are used for the doorway and give a pleasing look that fits the Tatooine style of building.  The doorway is hinged to allow the set to be opened up, giving easy access to the inside.  
Another new colour is introduced too.  A sand blue.  It is somewhere between light blue and light grey, but is quite pleasing and combines well with the dark red and brown also used in the cantina construction.
It's a shame that the Cantina itself is nothing more than a booth, as the scene in the film would lend itself well to Lego.  Hopefully in the future a bigger and more detailed cantina will be released, complete with a new assortment of minifigs.  I'm sure there are plenty of fans who are just foaming at the mouth for a bunch of Bith cantina band minifigures and a Ponda Baba, ready to start trouble with any farm boy he doesn't like.

I'll give this set a 4 brick rating.  It loses a brick for not being all it could have been, given it's hefty price tag at the time.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

First of all every keeps making remarks why is the Sand Trooper is holding a staff? Well because in the movie he was of course it was not that long, but Lego took the time and added that detail to this set. 

Second everyone complains about the Catina being to small, hey I would love to have a full catina, but if Lego did that the set would cost to much and then we would all complain about that. 

Third complaint I read is Luke having a lightsaber. Well rerember when Obi Wan rescued Luke from the Sand People in his house Obi gave showed him his father's lightsaber and said he would have wanted him to have it. 

The only complaint I believe is justified is no C3PO or R2D2! 

Pros -
Greedo (Very Rare) with a customize blaster
Very Accurate SandTrooper with DewBack Lizard 
Printed Legs on Luke Mini Fig 
Land Speeder is nice

"sger434","2009-08-10T07:13:55.797Z","sorry about the mess","this set isnt what the set is all about because the cantina is just 1 table in a corner and a arch shaped door way it should have been biggger for the price (£26.99) the landspeeder is ok but the seats dont stay in place when you take the min-figs out. the animal thingy that the sandtrooper rides is useless because it cant even walk. pros and cons:

pros:
good mini-figs
nice tan pieces
greedo
tatoonie luke
han solo ( i think this set is the only cheapest set for han solo then) 
sand trooper
alot of light saber hilts (grey)

cons:
cantina is way too small
not worth the price
animal thingy cant walk
landspeeders seats come off easily

overall: 5.5/10 ok ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-11-17T21:42:00.467Z","Lots of stuff.","The Dewback: Not much. Not much detail, not much posability. The legs are molded together, so they have to move with eachother. Not the greatest.

Landspeeder: Not very good with detail. It has a plethora of studs on the top, making it look ugly. It does, though, have a clunky, worn out look to it. One of the engines is a different color, probably resembling that its been repaired.

Cantina: Can you even call it that? They really need to make a larger version of this and add more to it. What we have here is a table, door, and ""bar"". In the movie the bar was a detailed mess of bottles and tubes. Here its a bottle, cup, and spigot. What we do get of the cantina is nicly detailed. And we also get Greedo in this set. The only place you can get him aside from the Sepratist Shuttle (not Greedo, but the same species).

Overall a good-Great set. I'd rate it 4 1/2, but I'm roundng to 5. The lack of detail and small cantina marks it down, but it's easy to get over.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Maul","2013-04-17T17:00:33.797Z","One of my favourite sets","<p>This is one hell of a set with many rare and exclusive parts and minifigures. It hasn't been yet remade and this is why this set is unique and a must-have for your SW collection.</p>

"henrymorris476","2017-02-02T16:02:44.77Z","Hive of Scum and Villainy","<p>I bought this set just before the release of the new Mos Eisley Cantina set in 2014, and so at the time it was the only way to get the Dewback and Greedo. Due to this, second hand copies were only available for extortionate prices, and you were lucky to get one used for under &pound;70.</p>

<p>Build and Parts</p>

<p>The main area of the build is actually not the cantina itself, but the landspeeder. It goes together pretty quickly, but still stands up today in terms of design, and is made in a pretty rare colour scheme. The back comes off to store the included lightsaber.The cantina itself is relatively&nbsp;bland, with an incredibly poor excuse for a bar, and only enough room to seat Greedo and Han. The table also flips up to include a hidden blaster, which is actually a bizarre way of showing the &quot;Han shot first&quot; scene. The parts used are again in relatively rare colours, but other than the ball pieces used on top, are not that exciting.&nbsp;The Dewback, before the release of the much updated one, was very exciting and one of the highlights of the set. It is made of several large molded&nbsp;pieces, which are mostly unique, and can seat the included Sandtrooper.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>This was one of the main draws of the set - the Greedo figure. It features a nice molded head piece, and unusual for the time, printed arms. The set doesn&#39;t include a blaster for Greedo for some reason, though. Han, Luke and Obi-Wan have all been included in very similar form in other sets, but Han and Obi-Wan are actually unique, and Obi-Wan has a lightsaber. The sandtrooper&nbsp;is also unique, but only because of it&#39;s cloth pauldron, and carries a pair of binoculars and lance (?) type object.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>This set is really only for collectors really, as the much better newer Mos Eisley Cantina can be acquired for a similar price, and contains all the same elements, plus a much extended Cantina and minifigure selection. However, for what it is, it is a reasonable representation of an iconic scene, as well as revered as a classic lego set. While the newer version shows off all the advances&nbsp;Lego has made, this version remains an enduring symbol of a time when Lego sets were much less complex and relied more on your imagintion.</p>
