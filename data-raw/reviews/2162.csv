"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-13T12:03:02Z","Fun to build!","A two part review. 

First the X-Wing. Building the ship is not that difficult but there are several interesting aspects to this ship. First is the use of gears to open and close the wings. Similar to the UCS X-Wing, the gears are operated via a knob on the back of the ship. Hoever, this knob in not intergrated into the design on a good way; it sticks way out; but this can be fixed. Secondly, again simliar to the UCS ship is the use of hinges to recreate the angle of the nose of the ship. Two drawbacks are (1) the &quot;landing gear&quot; which is a disssappointment and (2) the bottom of the nose of the ship is open. Overall, an OK ship that is a step up from the old 7140 system set, borrowing aspects of the UCS X-Wing.

Yoda's Hut. Well, to me this is the actual gem of the set. Designed well with good details when you open it up(footlocker to keep lightsabre, cooking utensils). My only complaint is that instead of giving us only 1/2 of the hut, Lego could have easily included the back half the hut. Oh well, I guess I'm going to have to do some parts shopping to complete the back half myself!

Overall a good set, worthy of inclusion in anyones collection. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-30T13:08:55Z","Nice design and an excellent set!","When I got this set several weeks ago, I was hopping it would be a good set. Fortunatly, it was. I really enjoy the well designed main body and the nifty front, wings are nice too. I also really like color scheme. I still dont really care for Yoda's hut, though it is pretty nice. Overall, this is one of the better Star Wars sets and if you dont have yet, get it!!!!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-27T13:03:07Z","best SW set of 2004 so far","I just got this set for Christmas, and as a fan and owner of every Lego Star Wars set, I can honestly say this is one of the best sets to date.  The new X-Wing is more detailed and scaled than the old one.  It has a roomy storage bin underneath and the droid socket is much better than the original.  The wings are bigger, the engine is better, there is a cool mechanism for expanding the wings into attack position.  this is the most detailed Lego ship 
excluding the UCS sets.  The set also comes with Yoda and his hut.  It is pretty cool.  There is a hidden compartment under his bed where you can store his lightsaber.  Luke comes with a little back pack that you can attach Yoda to, but it is kind of a lame concept.  Other than that, this set is amazing.  If you only buy one Star Wars set this year, make it this one!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-23T12:13:15Z","Better than 7140","Way better than the 7140 X-Wing. Better proportioned and scaled. It should have been lt. grey instead of white and tan. Tan? What were they thinking. The second best part about it is that it comes with Yoda's hut. Gotta love Yoda.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Looks better without all the moss items in place.  Yoda hut is a tad cheesy, but it adds a few hard to find parts.  Overall a must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-17T08:51:22Z","The X-wing was made to be white.","I like the white in this set, its better then grey besauce white makes it look cleaner and it brings out other colours also. I think the new X-wing is more well put together then the first one from looks (but I never owned the first one so I wouldnt know) It looks alot more accurate and just all around btter then the origanal. I also like that they added Yodas hut in this set, sure it might be more about $20 more expensive but its worth it.   15/10 because The X-wing is just cool",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T16:51:18Z","Almost didn't buy this one, but I'm glad I did","I only picked this one up because I found it for roughly half the RRP on eBay, but I'm glad I did.  It's soooo much better than the original X-Wing (7140), more detail, bigger, better wing mechanism (if a little slow) and R2 is enclosed now, Another Luke (albeit in different garb) figure and a Yoda (with normal-sized lightsabre - it should have been half-sized).

Very impressed with the construction of the nose - has a nice angled shape rather than the boxy one of the first model.

My only complaint is that the compartment on the underside doesn't sit against the fuselage and the lightsabre (if you keep it there) can fall out during flight.

I don't necessarily think that the price is right, but it's a cool set, no doubt.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-07T08:39:47Z","Never judge a model by the box art.","I had this set for some time, but never felt inspired to make it - preferring other things like the AT - TE. I put this down to the picture on the box - which is uninspiring and certainly does not do it justice. I think it would be better if they used a picture of it in combat rather than raising out of the swamp - surely no - one is going to stick the green things on their X - wing anyway! When I ran out of other SW sets to make I decided to go for it. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is a really good set and pretty close to the UCS set (which i do not own) at a fraction of the cost. It appears to be very accurate and the way the wings open has not failed to impress anyone i have shown so far. Love the colours which also look too bright on the box. I now really like this model which has benefited from a couple of very minor modifications (that i always do to obtain improved accuracy) and wish i had not had such a downer on it. Yodas hut is OK if you want that, but i just wanted a cool looking X wing. Would have been better with additional luke minifig in his orange flight suit so you could put him in the cockpit. I have put in a spare orange luke, but he does not sit comfortably as it is obvious the cockpit was not designed for occupation. R2 D2 also benefits from being raised by one clip height to make it that little more prominent like in the films and UCS version. Have added landing skids to bottom engine nacells where they should be and removed skids from rear fuselage. These mods could have been made by lego at virtually no extra cost as the number of bricks removed is the same as those replaced. Still pretty good though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I really like how there is a cockpit, a storage place, a place for the droid, and how the wings open.  I kind of wish he was wearing the orange suit, because this is my first star wars set and I don't have any others.

Don't pay any attention to the pic on the box, it sucks and really doesn't value the set itself...so don't care if it looks crappy, cause once you've build it up, it's worth the look!

Compared to the ancient x-wing sets, this one is much longer and a little larger, and just better. compare it to a picture of the &quot;real&quot; x-wing, you'll see how good it was recreated by Lego.

The system to open the wings is ingenious, and I admit it, better than the previous one. Colors are quite nice, and Yoda's just the best minifig ^^. His hut is also well moddled.

The cockpit has the average Death Star trench screen and unbelievably, a control stick, I mean, how super is that!  The wings are longer and the nose is longer and more pointy than the older 7140 X-wing. This is a defenate MUST HAVE and the detail is just Incredible with the capital &quot;I&quot;.

This time the lego devellopers have gone beyond my imagination what is possible to make with lego. First the nose has the perfect shape like the real one. Second the technique they used for the extraction of the x-wings is beautiful made. Looks like a gearbox inside. The X-wing is also in scale with the figures, the older wasn't.

Under the nose is a luggage compartment and landing gear that actually retracts! It is very sturdy and uses a very complex and nice gadget to open and close the s-foils! The laser cannons on the wings are also a nice detail! R2-D2 has a nice inclosed place to fly in and the cockpit has a joystick and a control panel, but it is a little bit cramped!

The set is just as sturdy, but was a lot sleeker, better colour scheme and featured both retractable landing gear and opening wings. Yoda's hut was also a nice addition.

Yoda has his gimer stick, a lightsaber hidden under his bed, and various other articles of living in his hut (pot, barrel, table, etc.).  Artoo is just a normal Artoo.

Pros:

"MasterBuilder","2009-01-04T21:03:30.263Z","Nice","Great set, the swamp sea-grass hanging on the X-Wing is a very nice detail. Yoda's hut is expertly designed, and even though it is a little small on the interior, you can ""open"" the back to play with it. The X-Wing's wings are pretty cool because you can toggle them into combat position and back to flight position. Overall a really great set. Luke is very well built, especially because he has a backpack thing that he trains with, just like in the movie.

The bad parts, though not many, are only my opinions. Firstly, I don't like how Yoda's legs don't move, especially because he is like the most ownage Jedi, so it greatly decreases his ""minifigureness"". The only other comment I really have on this set is that the wings on the ship, when changing the position, it moves kind of slowly so you cannot quickly shift in and out of combat. This greatly degrades the playability of this set, but is still a very good model if you are a collector.

The X-Wing is also very good. It does have the function (though it takes a while) to open the wings making the X which it was named after. It also has plant gunk hanging off of it which can easily come off. It's got landing gear, opening cockpit wih plenty of room inside, and an opening back.

Dagobah Luke is very cool, but I&nbsp;really&nbsp;think they should include Luke's pilot outfit as well since they already have the helmet. I was very upset to find this out as a kid after I bought the set, since I thought Pilot Luke was awesome. Yoda is very cool, and he only appears in two other sets in this variant, so it's good to have him.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The best thing about this set is that Lego couldn't seem to find many ways to make the X-Wing any better, since their latest version is essentially the exact same set without Yoda and his hut, and with a few other minifigs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, a must-have for any Lego Star Wars collection, and great for kids too!

Making yodas hut and vines on the ship was some pretty smart thinking, as well as the backpack yoda can be placed on. Easy to build.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building&nbsp;experience is actually quite dificult with the X-Wing. If&nbsp;you mess up at&nbsp;all you have to start over. And sometimes the wings fall off if you bump them. Yoda's hut is decent to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the X-Wing, You don't get a lot of basic parts. It is actually quite nice. Most come in handy if you want to build something else. Yoda's hut, same thing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a lot you can do with this set.

"whtknt","2012-01-01T17:16:41.59Z","Fun to assemble","<p>I was quite pleased with this set, the complexity of which surprised me.
 I have seen other X-Wing fighter sets that are not nearly as detailed 
or handled so neatly. At several points during assembly, I questioned 
the design of the kit, thinking that once fully assembled, it would 
prove flimsy or would not hold it's shape, but the designers surprised 
me and accomplished some remarkable things. The wings of the fighter 
open and close, and stay in the position they are placed in (thanks to 
some ingenious use of elastic bands), which makes it great for display, 
whether on a static surface or suspended from a line. Yoda's hut folds 
in upon itself to form a nice, compact little dwelling, but smoothly 
opens out to expand to a full playset!<br>
<br>
The level of skill required to build this kit is not high, but there are a lot of pieces, many of which must be assembled in exactly the manner shown for things to work.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>One of the only sets I know of to include Luke in Dagobah fatigues<br></li><li>I love the way that Yoda's tiny hut opens out to a full playset<br></li><li>X-wing can be covered in swamp grass or left pristine</li><li>Little details like the secret compartment in the X-wing and the one in Yoda's hut<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The level of detail on R2-D2 is not up to par with other sets</li><li>The only thing missing is the testing tree with a Darth Vader figure<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, a nice set that any Star Wars fan would be proud to own. If you are more into playing than collecting, then this set will give you hours of fun letting Luke train with the master of the Force on Dagobah, and it's flexible enough to let you make a number of other designs, even with no other kits.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
