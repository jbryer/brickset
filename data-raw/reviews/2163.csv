As a set, this is great.  Very easy to build took far less time than the original MF.  The hyperdrive is way cool.  Don't really care for the new skin tones of the minifigs, but some may like.  Love the way it opens up and ability to play with the inside compartment.  Although, for the avid collector, (in the words of Coka-Cola) ain't nothing like the real thing baby.    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-04T08:59:23Z","Magnificent &quot;Piece of Junk&quot;","There seems to be a lot of criticism in principle about sets that are redos – why? Wouldn’t most people try to make a set more accurate, or when they build something from scratch try to make it as faithful to the prototype as possible? So why should Lego be criticised for doing just this? As for those who think it is a rip off – well you don’t have to buy it! I never owned the previous one anyway, but from what I have seen this is far more accurate.

First off nice box with a flip up flap with picture of Death Star and Lego versions of Falcon, X-wing and TIE fighters. This is the first large set I have made in the new “blue tint” light Grey/Dark Grey bricks/plates. Unfortunately there are also (still) the dreaded coloured bricks used (mostly in the interior, but some show through) which detract form the appearance. The Tan bricks could easily have been grey. Some of the dark grey and tan bricks used on the top are best replaced with light grey, but a matching is difficult with spares in the new shades being at a premium.

The set goes together quite well with the use of some specialist bricks I have not seen before to achieve the shape. The interior is quite detailed with the hyper drive (sticker - not printed brick on top) in place and an odd orange brick that doesn’t quite fit properly on top until “pegged” in place. As you go along and the thing grows is quite unwieldy and difficult to handle – especially when the top plates go on. I would suggest leaving the landing gear off until near the end and then picking it up front and rear only to avoid implosion. Blue engine effect seems quite good to me. 

There is a clever mechanism that lowers and raises the ramp by pulling/pushing the docking port. On the opposite side the docking port hinges through 90 degrees to allow for an escape pod to be removed. Not sure about the authenticity of this, and it does tend to weaken that side of the ship leaving a gaping hole. 

Cockpit cannot be accessed from the ship as the way is blocked by the construction method. Interior needs fixing upright so it cannot twist round. Han and Chewie are a tight fit one behind the other. Lego have made a mistake in the construction/instructions relating to the attachment of the cockpit transparency providing the alternative bricks loose in the box and an updated page I assume this will be corrected on later versions.

Minifigs are now flesh coloured as opposed to yellow which I prefer. Luke and R2 are not included here as in the Hoth scenario where this is set they are of course on their way to Dagobah by X-wing. However, you do get a snow trooper (with blaster) to go with those in the AT-AT.

Some printed, but mainly stickers to provide that finishing touch – vents etc. Whole thing is impressive when finished and can be made even more accurate just by exchanging colours – I wish Lego would have the guts to issue a one colour set – we would still buy it. It is quite large, but I doubt it will be as easy to “play” with, as it is difficult to handle. As a sculpture it is superb. I thought it was worth the money and despite minor gripes about colours and stickers has to be a 10 as it looks like what it is supposed to and that is my main test.

The snowtrooper body is however incorrect being that of a clone trooper. You also get the standard &quot;wheel&quot; of tools to add to the interior, though whether there ever was an oil can on board i doubt.

I would say that this set it got to be the best release lego set totally over throwing the orginal falcon 7190. 4504 has got a much better and accurate design to the real falcon in the star wars trilogy. Lego provided this set with a bunch of new bricks such as the new light grey and flash tone minifigs (some may like some don't) and the new long right angle plates which form the roof of the ship. The cockpit is a much better design than the orginal 7190 yet some people say that its to big but really if fits in to the ships design like a silk glove.
The whole of the sides are joined by click hinges and form a very gappy falcon but can be coustermised easily. Lego has made some glitches such as having a clone torso for the snowtrooper.(lego will fix it hopefully)
The ship is very flimsy and breakable but the detail is a beauty. Beside the stickers the set is worth the $100. It is a inch bigger than the orginal falcon (7190) which is a plus and has a better colour scheme...no blues and reds :) 
Something which i just can't put my finger on it is the radar disk ontop of the new falcon. extra is the r-lazar that comes with it....its just somthing extra it is small and 'junkie' you can easaly make one better. It has a hatch that you can lift to put in the excape pod and on the other side the is a raised ramp which the figures can come and go but the ramp breaks all the time. the minifigs come in the set are chewie, holo (hoth cloths) lei with the rare hair bun (hoth cloths) c3po and stormtrooper.
Dont attempt to lift this ship upside down because the flaps &quot;tri plates&quot; will open.

overall great set...what a beauty ...full of detail and great characters (skin tone :s )

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-19T06:19:53Z","Awesome, though a few problems","This set is a wonderful model and just looks better and better as it is completed.  Others have said pretty much everything that needs to be said, but I must emphasize the annoying aspects of decals used in this set and the things that I was hoping for that were not there.  I bought this set in hopes that the cockpit could be accesible from the inside and it easily could have been made to do so.  Unfortuneately, it is not, and I honestly liked the older cockpit design much better.  The stickers are quite annoying, I almost was considering not putting them on just because they tend to give problems with straightness and accuracy when applying.  Figures are great (though not worth $45 individually as some people try to sell them for, absurd!)  The engine is great and the escape pod is soooo much better than the original.  I must say, however that the worst part of the ship is the four turret laser on the top.  A horrible design; binoculars and gray lightsaber poles?!!  There were so many other unique elements, why couldn't these be made unique as well to give the set a better look?  It looks as though the designers just wanted to finish the set and just stuck &quot;whatever worked&quot; up on top there.  I will definitely be modifying that myself.  oh well, enough criticism.  Very neat and worth the buy, aside from a few modifications taht need tto be made.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

When I saw this set I wanted this set a lot. I had to give up many months of allowance to get this. And I am glad I did that. This beautiful set has many play features and looks awesome.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-17T19:37:16Z","Best lego Set","The New Millennium Falcon is the best lego I have Bought, and I have been playing with lego for 20 year, I wanted this set since I looked in the internet at the beginning of the year, I finally gated from Lego Shop at home Canada, because I didn’t founded in any store.
First of all I goad the new edition that have the new box, that is totally black, and I think that is the best lego box that I have.
I just finished building a few moment ago and it is amazing, it is very big, the out side look very cool and very realistic compare to the movie, the interior have a very cool detail like the Hiper Drive part whit all the tool and the 3 chairs with the chess table, the door of the bottom of the ship is clever and the system with technic pieces for closing the door for the outside is very cool, It have a relice system for a small ship that’s work very well, the roof that can by opened in 13 part is very nice, and in the center it have a cool command center, the cockpit is very nice and you can put Han Solo and Chewbacca almost side by side.
I also like the small laser gun for the snowtrooper.
Lego correct the torso of the snowtrooper for this edition.
Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and C3-PO minifigure are great and I like the skin tone for Han and Leia.
The only thing I will prefer or correct from this set is like in almost lego Set that it came with more minifigure I think that Luke and R2-D2 are missing in the set but is ok because I haven for other set and I can putted inside

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-09T00:13:43Z","Straight from the archives at ILM","Bought this yesterday and had SO MUCH FUN putting it together. What a set! I say &quot;straight from the archives at ILM&quot; because it has got to be the most accurate of all Star Wars Lego sets. There are many Pros and a few Cons:

Pros: accurate design; excellent color scheme and assortment; the incredible ramp; awesome interior: metal grating plates, the chessboard, the hyperdrive; the incredible cockpit (exterior!); many 'new' and rare/unique blocks are included; and the minifigs are AWESOME!!! Luke and R2D2 are not in this set because they weren't flying out of Hoth and into the asteroids. The snowtrooper rocks and the E-Web blaster he uses is not that bad.

Cons: I don't like the decals. Some of the blocks could've already had them on. I messed up on the decal for the quads/turret. Argghh, because now I can't remove it to fix it. Regarding the turret itself, it's ok, but I agree with the comment that since there are many unique pieces in this set, might as well do something more unique with the turret.  The cockpit (interior) is really lame.  Lego figured out how to include both Han &amp; Chewie inside (clever), but the controls are lame and the cockpit itself is a little loose. The exterior cockpit is really just a 'shell': in fact, it doesn't even connect to the cockpit itself! Despite these 3 complaints, this set is still a whopping 10--one of the BEST Lego sets EVER and worth the price.

I just finished building the falcon 10 minutes ago and it looks great! since the other reviewers already said pretty much everything about it, I won't write a long pro/cons summary.

I don't understand why lego had to give some human colored skin to han and leia. That makes 'em look like aliens 'cause all other figures will have yellow skin...

What I don't like :

-the cockpit barely holds to the structure
-puting the decals by myself ;-)
-for a massive ship, lego put only one weapon, the turret cannon on top of the falcon, makes it quite weak :-/! 

What I like(d):

-Building it
-The hyperdrive
-the ramp system
-The chess table
-the fact that it looks acurate (way more than the previous one)

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-11T05:38:19Z","Great Set!! Find it on sale however.","I've walked past this set 100 times, and the price had never dropped below $97. Until one day (about a week after Christmas) I noticed the price tag had a couple lines penned through it. There was no alternative sale tag on any shelf, so I curiously I took the Falcon from its high shelf and took it to the customer-convienent price scanner. $75!! That helps a little, but just so happens I have $35 in gift cards in my pocket. Now $40, thats a bargain I can live with.

So I picked it up in the morning after work, and sleepily constructed the 986 piece set in 3 hours and 40 minutes. Thats kind of slow for me. I didn't like the constuction much. I'm used to building huge sections of models and putting them all together at the end. I.E. the AT-AT is made up of 7 sections. This set is one big piece with a small removable cockpit, and escape pod, and several removable top panels that are only about 8 to 15 pieces each. But once I closed it up and set it up alone on the table, I finally fell in love. IT LOOKS ALOT LIKE THE REAL (you know what I mean) MILLENIUM FALCON!!

I love the loading ramp! I've got the snow trooper and tripod gun sitting right on it so when it lowers... HA HA HA! The cockpit although small and only able to seat two minifigs is done well in order to keep in scale with the rest of the ship. I like how it can be easily removed so you don't get frusterated trying to seat your figures in it. I like the escape pod, although its hard to seat more than one figure in there. I like the use of tubing in order to represent the ion glow of the engines, this is the best idea ever. I like how they made chain sections of the hull (yeah I guess those count as big sectional chunks) that help create the hight and curve of the hull. I love how their is so much room inside the ship. You can actually put some serious cargo in what is meant to be a cargo freighter. I like the quad-gun and up top, that is scaled well. MOST OF ALL, I LOVE THE SCALE. Of course it isn't perfect, but its close enough, you can fit alot of people in this thing, and it could serve well as a manion for a large family of large insects. I like the peach colored minifigs but they don't mesh well with previous minifigs.

There were a few things I didn't like. The price for one, but that's been covered. 
IT NEEDS TO COME WITH A BELLY GUN! I took the gun from the top and switched a few pieces around (without adding or removing any) and it fits perfectly! The legs are long enough and they don't get in the way. So why not include another? The Real (ha ha yeah) Falcon had two! 
The real falcon's cockpit seats four, but ommision is understandable. The top panels, esspecially the heavier forward one, pop off or just pop up way to easily, so its hard to pretend the ship's performing a barrel roll. Plus the ship should have some missles in the forward compartment.There should also be a hidden compartment somewhere as well.

Oh well, the Falcon was a modified super-fast smuggling freighter in the movies, there's no reason why I should feel bad about modifying my own. These are all (except the floppy top panels) authentication issues. Standing alone all closed up, the Millenium Falcon is a real beautiful model that I am glad I bought.

First, the worst thing about this set is the weak middel section. The ramp and stuff makes the connection weak and it can be a complete drag when building itI suggest that you build it on a flat surface and read reviews before you buy it so you know hot to reinforce it. With a few beam pieces, it cannot break!  Unlike most people think, this thing is very, very fun to play with (Although you should keep the landing gear on, it is a total headcase to hold it with one hand!). I make this ship fly all over my yard and land in secret msuggling dens!  The flaps on the top come off easily but not when they are colosed!  The cockpit is nice and it isnt that weak, you might want to change the control panel around. The escape pod is another great effect and so is the hyperdrive unit and use of the blue &quot;hose&quot; as the engine exhaust!  The front mandibles also are cool and host a nice cargo area. The chess table is also a defanite nice touch!  This probably one of my all time favorite sets. I ove flying han and Chewy all over the yard and house on smuggling missions with TIE son their tail!  I just wish this set had yellow figures just like most other people!  Ill say it again, this is the best set ever in Star wars,, with the AT-AT, AT-TE, Gunship, and X-wing in grim competition!

In response to this, Lego has vastly revamped all three Lego sets featuring the crafts and, of course, 4504 is the most hyped. What can I say? It more than surpassed my expectations.

The box is huge, coming with a flip-top cover which reveals more pictures but, sadly, no movie stills. Unlike the previous rendition of the Falcon which threw in Luke, R2-D2 and Ben Kenobi, this one is packaged as an Episode V set with a snowtrooper and an E-Web cannon flung in for good measure. However, the cannon looks puny in comparison with the massive ship, and the scene recreated needs far more than just one snowtrooper. Oh well, they tried.

Off comes the lid and out pop the eyes. There are 985 pieces in the set, resulting in loads of bags, packaged colour-specific and not according to the building steps. Some of the bags are double-packaged, strangely. As with all extra-large glue-bound instruction booklets, this one flops about too much and is consequently hard to handle. Though the amount of and type of pieces required for each step are listed, the booklet is where most of my gripes are concentrated. A clone-trooper torso is printed instead of the snowtrooper one, the colour of a piece varies from sub-step to sub-step and dark grey is very, very easy to confuse with black. However, it would be unwise to judge a set by its booklet alone.

We’ll work from the appetizer slowly up to the entr&#233;e, if that’s fine. Minifigs. Five in all, which by me is a bit too little for a set this size. But I get Chewie! Yes, finally I possess a Chewbacca minifigure! Han and Leia come in their Hoth outfits, never-before-seen, and in a flesh-tone colour. This has seen a negative response, but starting from the basketball range Lego is applying flesh-tone to all their licensed sets, since they resemble actual actors or sports stars. It is bitter-sweet as the colour has made the figurines look more realistic but has ridden them of their compatibility with  the classics. And then there is, of course, the afore-mentioned snowtrooper with a great printed torso and nicely-moulded headpiece with attaches to the backpack. C-3PO appears as well, in all his milky-golden glory.

Speaking of compatibility, the set comes in the new shades of grey, popularly known as “blue-grey” or “bley”. Fans are divided over this, but hey, a bit of change now and then is fine by me. 

Moving on to the actual model now. The overall structural integrity is very solid, but building this baby demands all the concentration you have. Make sure you attach the bricks firmly together. Missing out even one step could prove fatal too. But enjoy the process, after all Lego is a building toy anyway.

The detail put in here just blows me away. There is now a full walkway around the interior of the craft, unlike with the previous incarnation. The back is decked out with a hyperdrive engine (the tile, is, sadly, stickered on), a couple of tool racks and even a little stand to put Han’s winter suit hood on. What looks like a bacta tank storage pod is put in as well, complete with funky trans-blue “head” pieces. Little maroon 1 by 2 pieces are placed, seemingly randomly, on the plated roof and protruding “teeth”, creating the intended battle-scarred look, whereas the previous Falcon looked brand new. I just love the way the roof is composed of separate tiles that open up; it makes the ship look way more accurate and in no way compromises its sturdiness in general. The turret looks great too; you can lift the top off to reveal a little seat with a targeting computer in front. Nice! The new escape pod is much, much worthier as compared to the butt-of-all jokes earlier version. Now fully enclosed, it is one of my favourite bits to the set. It blocks off quite a chunk of the walkway, but that’s to be expected. On the opposite end, if you were to pull the docking bay out mid-way, a bar connected to the landing ramp helps lower it. An awesome touch and an interesting detail, albeit a tad flimsy.

Now, on to the chunkier and by far more controversial portions of the ship. The teeth or mandibles look fine on the box cover, but after getting them built I was thinking to myself: gosh! So small! I’ve done some research and most official drawings and photographs depict the Falcon with much longer teeth, wider and as thick as the rest of the craft. Modifying this portion also proved extremely unwieldy. 

Next to it sits the cockpit which, in my opinion, is one of the few parts of the set that is not an improvement on the former rendition. I was quite appalled to find that the portion on which the minifigures were singing was left hanging loosely in mid-air. Using some of my own (washing machine) bricks I did a bit of fixing. Also, while the cockpit in the film sits four comfortably, you have trouble getting just Han and Chewie into the cockpit. Plus they’re seated one in front of the other, not even sitting side-by-side! Anyway, we’ll continue and I’ll stop ranting about the small barren patch of land surrounded by perfect paradise.


Two jointed ribs encircle the Falcon, the one at the back with a transparent tube running down the centre, most possibly the exhaust. The separate roof plates attach to these ribs. Attaching the ribs to the ship itself is a truly delicate process, awkward at first but easier the second time around. 


The Falcon sits proudly in the centre of my living room coffee table, roof tiles proudly open, escape pod detached (with Chewbacca standing on it doing maintenance) and with all the other Star Wars Lego sets around it seeming to bow in submission. This set being the “holy grail” so to speak of Star Wars Lego, it will be that way for a very, very long time. I am ever grateful for this marvellous piece of Lego design (the minor hiccups are excusable any day) and here’s my overall opinion in three words: I love it! This is among the best of the Star Wars models to date and is more, much more actually than simply an improvement or a second version. The Millennium Falcon is special, that I know.

"Darth_Shockwave","2007-10-13T11:41:27.31Z","One of the most impressive sets made","Han's favourite 'hunk of junk'. The Millenium Falcon gets an updated design, except this time the model is set in The Empire Strikes Back, hence why there is a Snowtrooper. This model has lots off play features, which includes an auto ramp, an escape pod, a swivelling gun turret, a swivelling radar dish, opening panels to give you a good look inside, and a Hyperdrive engine at the back. The dual floor design looks great, especially with the grated tiles. They give the impression off machinery inside the inner workings. The gun turret is nicley designed, which comes complete with a targeting computer. There is also included Chewies Dejarik game board, and Hans annalising computer terminal. Put this model with your X-Wings and other Rebel fighters, and you'd have the start to one great looking hanger scenario. Just one maojor gripe though, why doesn't Han have his bomber jacket. Anyway's onto the pro's and con's.

Pro's: - 
Better updated design
Gun station which fits a figure
Auto loading ramp
Looks very impressive
Snowtrooper, with tripod cannon
First Hoth Leia and Han
Blue pipping, for the engine effect
Hyperdrive
Opening panels

Con's: - 
No gun turret underneath
No small gun turret which pops out from secret hatch
Han should really be wearing his bomber jacket
Has gaps around the sides

Overall: - I love this set it's very impressive, and certainlty grabs a lot off attention from poeple when they see it, the only thing that would put people off would be the price tag. I highly recommend getting this set, but as it's not been available for nearly 2 years there's very little chance off finding a reasonably priced one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

On the inside of the ship is the game board table (which, in its simplicity, makes it great), a couple of tools, a very detailed hyperdrive, an escape pod, and a boarding ramp. Sadly, the boarding ramp which is meant to be lowered constantly jams and rarely works. Also, the cockpit which Chewie and Han reside in is loosely connected to the ship, and can break off easily if you're not careful. On a lighter note, beneath the gun turret is a small cockpit for Luke to stay in. Buy it! (Even if it costs $350 on ebay!)",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5

It has lots of features, like hyperdrive and an escape pod. The top, unlike the first one, does not come off, but instead the many long, grey bricks that cover it can bend up due to hinges. While they are rather flimsy, and aren't really as good for play like the first Millennium Falcon was, it's ok, since this one is for display, and it's a lot heavier too.

This model does contain a snowtrooper and turret which looks very nice regardless of size. There's not much to say about the outside of the Falcon. It has the dish, cockpit, landing gear, and upper turret. Sadly there is no lower turret, but I'm sure one would be easy to construct. I do have to complain about the cockpit. It's too small. In the movie it could easily hold 4 people. Here, it barely holds 2. It also has 2 blue tubes (I think...Maybe one) on the back for the engines which looks very nice.
Now to the insides. There is alot of stuff going on. It has some cooling tanks for the engines in the back which are made from Kohrak-Kal's hand and some trans-blue minifig heads. There are also 2 more tubes on either side. They also have a game board where C3-PO and Chewy played their holographic death-match. On one side there is an escape pod. The other side, when pulled out, will open the boarding ramp. One problem though- The panels that you open to get inside will sometimes fall off, but it's not major.

Building the ship takes awhile. Took me nearly 3 hours every time I've disassembled and rebuilt it. The build does have some monotony, but seeing the ship come together makes it all worth it.

Features:
The ship is nicely detailed. The outside is a good representation of the MF, and for play it can swoop but care must be taken as its components do not have fantastic support. The interior is well detailed and very playable. There is the chess game area, the engine room and couple other areas that can modified or serve to place passengers. There is massive interior room and one could probably fit 20 figures inside.
The cockpit is probably the only drawback as it sits 2 figures snugly and that's it.
The top opens up like an Outback Blooming ONion and provides good access to the inside. It has a turret seat, an escape pod and a working ramp (although moving passengers along this ramp is nearly impossible).

The figures are great, but I was expecting to see Obi Wan AND Luke as they left Tatooine (even though it has Leia as in Episode 6).

I purchased it for 99 dollars in 2004 and have never regretted it. It is definitely worth the effort to obtain from any Lego SW collector ala Ebay. I would buy it again now if I needed to for $175. It's that great. The Venator Class or Star Destroyer do not compare.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I left out many parts including the small piston like parts connecting the cockpit to the ship, for these make the cockpit unstable. After building it carefully and pushing hard on each piece together, the end result was the most sturdy ship in my entire LEGO collection. Even when dropped this ship takes little damage.

   My favorite part of the ship is its interior details. On one side of the ship there is a ramp that drops down. Surprisingly, it works very well. On the other side of ship there is a escape pod. The pod has a control panel inside and a very nice detailed outside. The side of the ship flips up to let the pod out. The only problem is it sometimes breaks off. The escape pod can hold two people, but you can pack more in it.
   The cockpit comes off to reveal an area that seats three people (if you put them in the right way) and a small control panel.
   In the main part of the ship there is a circular chest table with chairs around it ( from the scene in ""A New Hope"" where Chebaka and C-3PO play chess with each other). Towards the back of the ship is the hyper drive generator. In the back of the generator there is a smooth 1 by 4 brick that say ""hyperdrive"". Around the generater there are racks that hold tools that come with the set (screw driver, hammer, wrench etc.).
   In the center of the ship is the turret whose top comes off. Inside there is a seat with a control panel (the spot where the turret is controlled).
   There is a cargo bay in the front of the ship which can hold a small amount of cargo.

We were there on Holiday, and I must have been about nine years old. And hwn I got home I just started building. I had had some smaller sets before, birthdays/christmas presents, but this one was totally awesome! Or, thats what I thought then. Because I bought the Ultimate Collectors Millenium Falcon a few years later, this one pretty much fell to the background. But that is just some information, so let's get to the set.

I bought the '2004: Original Trilogy Edition Box'. It was a nice box, so nothing to complain about on that part. But when building it, I kinda lost the feeling I usually get when building the set. It wasn't that great of a structure, and overall, it just wasn't as much fun as always.

Nothing to say about the parts, they just come with the box I guess...

Playability is great on this one. The roof that openes is a great idea, the interior is well-organised. The cockpit capsule is pretty annoying beacause it often falls of - the roof parts too, actually - but that is just the only problem if you are playing.

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2015-01-17T02:45:03.75Z","Does some things better than 7190, but does others worse.","<p>When Lego released 4483 Imperial AT-AT in 2003, it started them on a bit of an Empire Strikes Back kick. 4479 Tie Bomber and 10123 Cloud City in the same year, and 4500 Rebel Snowspeeder and 4502 X-Wing Fighter earlier in 2004. Then, closer to Christmas, they revealed another behemoth set: 4504 Millennium Falcon. I so happened to receive it for Christmas the following year. I was a bit annoyed to have not received Ultimate Space Battle like I&#39;d asked for, but I was also happy to have a Millennium Falcon set at long last. It&#39;s okay, but part of me wishes they&#39;d bought 7190 off eBay instead. I still don&#39;t own that one but I have spent a fair bit of time looking at scans of the instructions, and I will be</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is not your ordinary Lego set box. The cardboard is a bit thicker than on some other packaging, it fastens shut with Velcro, and it&#39;s big enough to store the completed model if one simply removes the landing legs and the sensor dish. This box was definitely intended to be kept (though of course parents can still ruin that for you because of how big it is, though I did save the big battle scene that&#39;s under the lift-up front/top flap to put up as a wall poster).</p>

<p>The instructions (as with 4483 and 4504) start with the main model, the Millennium Falcon itself, and finish up with the E-web repeating blaster cannon. Interestingly, the instructions for this set actually capture the new bluish grays correctly - a rarity in my personal experience. In any case, they&#39;re good save for a couple of slightly tricky angles in some steps.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>To build a ship this big and detailed takes a large number of parts, some of which are themselves on the larger side such as the umpteen 3x12 wing plates used for the roof, or the 8x8 plates and 8x8 grille plates (Probably a weight-saver, those. At least I hope they were chosen for that purpose, because using them instead of more regular 8x8 plates wouldn&#39;t be totally stupid in that case). There&#39;s one piece, however, that definitely sticks out: The dark orange Kohrok-Kal shield that forms the top of the hyperdrive. Always nice to see Lego find new uses for parts like that. There&#39;s also a wheel of tools included - one simply cannot have enough spare tools, so that&#39;s lovely. However, there are some annoying lacks on the accessory front. All the same, you certainly get your money&#39;s worth at the MSRP when it comes to volume of parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes five. Han Solo in a parka, Chewbacca in the new reddish brown, Leia in her cold-weather uniform, C-3PO in pearl gold, and an Imperial Snowtrooper with bluish-gray hips. The first batches of the set had an error with regards to the snowtrooper: Clone trooper torso assemblies, complete with black hands, were used instead of snowtrooper torso assemblies (Mine was a later one with the correct torso, but I think he still might have ended up with black hands) Han had been available in his cavalier clothes in the original 7190 Millennium Falcon set as well as Cloud City and a Star Wars 3-figure pack, and minus his vest in 7104 Desert Skiff, but this was the first time he was produced in a parka as well as the first time he was available in the realistic flesh tones that had become the new standard for licensed minifigures starting with the 2004 Harry Potter sets (and indeed, it&#39;s likely the Harry Potter theme is responsible for the change). I did already own a Han thanks to the Desert Skiff set, so he was perhaps the least valuable to me. Chewbacca, Leia, and 3PO were all completely new as far as my collection went, however, and very welcome (no more substituting backwards Qui-Gon hair on a brown 1x1 cylinder on a brown torso!). The snowtrooper was also useful. Overall, they&#39;re a very nice bunch.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build on this set is very involved and lengthy. Some parts of it can also be frustrating, such as building the deck of the ship - it&#39;s fragile until you start adding the top plates. The saucer shape of the Falcon&#39;s main body is handled in a more complex method here than in 7190: where that set used large saucer bricks and some 4x8 wing plates to pull off the shape and had a roof that lifted off wholesale, this set uses ratchet hinge bricks with plates on top for the rounded sides and forms the roof out of triangular sections that clip to the segments of the sides. It allows for more brick-built detail rather than printed or sticker detail, certainly, but it there are prices it pays for that. Speaking of stickers, several are involved in adding detail to certain pieces of the set. While most won&#39;t be a problem assuming they&#39;ve been cut properly (which thankfully you can count on with Lego).. the one for the roof of the gunnery well will cause you pain. I had to take it off and retry a few times before I got it lined up right. Best to apply the sticker with the part already in place, it will help.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It all comes together to create a very big model with lots of interior detail and play features. Pulling on the starboard docking port lowers the boarding ramp (do be gentle here, though: Tug too hard and you&#39;ll pop the mechanism off the ramp and it&#39;s a bit fiddly to reconnect). The port docking port (Don&#39;t you love English?) lifts up to let you deploy an escape pod. There&#39;s some seats in the bow, one of which swivels. The other two are near a Dejarik board, one of which was also included in 7190.&nbsp; There&#39;s a compartment just forward of this area in which one can store the included mailbox-type container.</p>

<p>At first glance, this Millennium Falcon is a lovely big, detailed set. The cockpit captures the conical shape better than 7190 did, and thanks to staggered seating can seat two minifigures at a time instead of just one. But on a closer look, a lot of problems with it become apparent. First and foremost, the set falls into the same trap as many, many, many, many toys and drawings of the Falcon: Short mandibles thanks to using a bad choice of reference pic. 7190 avoided this mistake, so this is rather grating.</p>

<p>While that&#39;s the most visually grating problem, there are plenty of others.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The clip hinges connecting the triangular roof sections and the port docking hatch don&#39;t have enough friction to deal with weight, so the docking hatch and the roof section with the sensor dish will flop open when flying the ship around.</li>
	<li>The roof sections themselves are fairly frail assemblies - if they fall off and hit anything other than carpet, they&#39;ll near-completely or even completely disassemble.</li>
	<li>The kind of pricy, detailed set this is, there&#39;s no excuse for Lego not including either a sticker or a webbed 6x6 dish to go with the other 6x6 dish to properly capture the look of the sensor dish.</li>
	<li>The quad gun is very skimpy; it looks pathetic and unfinished. 7190 managed a decent quad-gun, so this later set with the more advanced engineering couldn&#39;t because why...? There&#39;s also only one of them. Sure, you&#39;d have to take it off to set the ship down on its base, but you&#39;d have to take the landing gear off to do that anyway.</li>
	<li>Where the front cargo doors on 7190 were functional and could actually allow one to load the small container into the ship, the shorter ones used here are basically just for decoration.</li>
	<li>More fun with mandibles: 7190 included the between-mandible cannons (could also double as the missile tubes) seen being fired in Return of the Jedi. This set doesn&#39;t.</li>
	<li>The overhanging central roof can get in the way when the Falcon is in playset mode. 7190&#39;s roof lifted off wholesale, avoiding this problem completely.</li>
	<li>Due to the use of grille plates instead of solid plates, a good chunk of the Falcon&#39;s considerable internal floor space is unusable. This was also not an issue in 7190 and is not an issue in 7965 either.</li>
	<li>Parts of the ship, such as the deck, can end up breaking in ways that require the entire central section to be separated from the rest and then dismantled and rebuilt. This is especially annoying if one has to deal with hyperactive siblings and/or parents who are turned into klutzes by proximity to toys.</li>
	<li>While the escape pod is an okay-looking pod, it&#39;s not very welcome in this set. The Millennium Falcon is never seen launching an escape pod in the movies, and the pod bay and the hyperdrive preclude the set having a secret smuggling compartment - something that is not only seen in the movies but is actually plot-relevant.</li>
	<li>Despite this set aiming to depict the Falcon&#39;s famous escape from the overrun Echo Base, the Falcon is bereft of any representation of the pop-out repeating laser. There was room to work it in somehow, but nope.</li>
	<li>To add insult to injury, there are no weapon accessories included in the set whatsoever. The only weapons are the attempt at the quad gun, and the snowtrooper&#39;s E-web turret.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While it&#39;s better than no Millennium Falcon at all, and it certainly had some ambitions... this set does have some serious problems. If you&#39;re looking to get a non-UCS Millennium Falcon set, I would give this one a miss. I would recommend getting either the older 7190 set, or the newer 7965 set (which is basically a do-over of this set that doesn&#39;t succumb to its worst failings and on top of that has two quad guns and retractable landing gear) instead. I would recommend getting one of those two even if you already have this one unless you&#39;re up for some severe modifications.</p>

"PooPotato","2014-03-23T02:29:01.11Z","First Flight Falcon","<p>Back in the day, the Millennium Falcon was the most coveted of all Lego Star Wars sets, and naturally as a Star Wars and Lego fan, I wanted one really bad. &nbsp;So the time came to Christmas, and my dream came true! &nbsp;It&#39;s been almost 10 years since I bought it, and it still sits proudly on my display shelf, showing no age compared to other sets in my vast Star Wars collection.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The first thing I remember about building this in 2nd grade was how much I screwed up trying to build it. &nbsp;The first time I built it, I forgot to put 2 VERY major plates on the bottom, and this quickly resulted in disaster! After examining the instruction booklet a second time, I quickly slapped myself on the head and rebuilt the entire thing. &nbsp;So the instructions weren&#39;t too hot, but the box definitely was! &nbsp;I recall the front having a flap that was secured by velcro, and you don&#39;t see that anymore...</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Until I purchased 7676 Republic Attack Gunship in 2008, this was the largest Lego set I owned. &nbsp;The amount of pieces included was vast, and opening all of those bags when you were a kid really put a smile on your face. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>Ah the minifigures! &nbsp;Han Solo was by far my favorite, and C-3P0 came in a close second. &nbsp;The Snowtrooper was a nice inclusion, and Chewbacca and Leia help make this an absolute minifig win in my eyes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>As stated before, the instructions caused a little bit of frustration on my part, but this could be due to my age at the time being well below the recommendation on the box. &nbsp;Otherwise the build was fairly simple, and like any other kid I looked forward to when I could build the panels and open the Falcon and recreate my favorite scenes from The Empire Strikes Back. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The completed model looks absolutely outstanding, especially next to my other Battle of Hoth sets. &nbsp;The escape pod was my absolute favorite part as a kid, and the hyperdrive&nbsp;was wonderful to look at as well. &nbsp;The landing gear are a little too easy to break off, but I can&#39;t find a better solution for this so it doesn&#39;t detract from the model as a whole. &nbsp;It is rather wide for a grade schooler to hold and swoosh around, and it ended up staying on the table when I played with it.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>Considering the fact that I&#39;ve had this model for ten years, and that I haven&#39;t once considered selling it or purchasing the new Falcon, this set is easily in my top 3 of all time. &nbsp;It looks wonderful next to the other members of my Rebel fleet, and will hopefully stay that way for years to come.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Minifig selection is wonderful</p>

<p>Build fairly easy</p>

<p>Play features are abundant</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Instructions a little challenging for a 2nd grader</p>

<p>Landing gear a bit flimsy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall 5/5, a set for the ages!</p>

"PizzaBrick","2019-01-26T13:20:41.4Z","My favourite millennium falcon!","<p>This set is one of many Millennium Falcons, but overall my favourite version including the USC version. It retailed for $100, has 985 pcs and 5 minifigs</p>

<p>First we got C3PO, it has a weird colour but I personally like it. It has the same moulds&nbsp;has today&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Second we have a Chewbacca, it&rsquo;s the reddish brown version. I prefer this one to today&rsquo;s one with his huge eyes.</p>

<p>Thirdly we have a snowtrooper, a nice touch. I yet again like this version than the new one.</p>

<p>Fourthly we have Han Solo, this is the hot version with the blue jumper, a nice Minifig.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>lastly we have a Hoth&nbsp;Leia, I like this version more than today&rsquo;s (Again). She has a tan jacket.</p>

<p>Firstly we have a mini turret, I like this as this can Attack the falcon while it drives</p>

<p>away.</p>

<p>Now we have the Falcon the exterior is grey and has less holes than the one today which is nice and makes it feel more complete and I like the cockpit. It also has a nice radar dish</p>

<p>The interior is less furnished than the new ones but this was made a while ago so</p>

<p>it makes sense, not much to talk about.</p>
