For instance, this set carries a whopping THREE of the smoke slope-type-thing originally introduced in the Aero X-Pod. Also there are the never-before-seen smoke 1x1 round plates which, I found, are quite fun to use and stand out more against a light-gray colorscheme than regular trans-white rounds. This set also carries the great 1x2 grille plates in chrome, if any of you out there like shiny stuff. I'm very happy with LEGO for making this set, it's great and inexpensive. Too bad it just resembles a large Aero Pod set without the pod itself, it almost seems like LEGO designed this for use with the pod only to discover that the pod was too small to fit all the pieces.

Also there inverted slope pieces that I consider juniorized(gasp!), but that's all. They really don't bother me much.

Note that this works great with the Aero pod parts combined. 

Overall it's fairly priced and is a must-own. Highly recommended.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It is not often that you can completly build more than one or two of the models featured in this type of set. I was able to build the speed boat, sub, yacht and jetski (all featured on the box front) with only a couple of small bits left over.

This would be a great set for someone starting their collection, inexpensive and packed full of peices. 

Looks like it was made to go with the yellow x-pod.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Four things can be built with the peices at the same time and the inspirations in the book are just great compared to other sets like this.  I love the colors too.  A little bright, but i'm not complaining.  The set was and remains to this day relatively cheap.  Overall, I think it was worth getting. See what you think.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
