Lots of randomly colored pieces, and too many glow-in-the-dark teeth.  Still, some useful stuff.  Go for it if you need a few pieces for finishing up a model or a spaceship.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-19T19:57:26Z","Awsome Shark!","This is a great set. But not the greatest. I love the shark. (99% why I picked it up).I saw JAWS written all over it. Its got cool joints which allow it to flex all over. I think the shark is worth 20 bucks.The other models are mediocre. Squids have 10 arms Lego! It has a lot of bricks and plates, and not many new pieces!     :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-22T02:13:28Z","Awesome...","I really love the set, particularly as it has some really nice new dark grey, and new grey pieces. I think Lego have successfully covered up their tracks here - you wouln't think that the colours had changed when looking at the shark. I think the lauch of those new hinges is great, but I can't figure out what they're replacing. Still, this set is the coolest I have bought in a long while, and with all the new bricks, such as the weird curving bricks, it's worth every penny of the &#163;15 I pad for it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-23T22:56:24Z","Sharks, and Squids and Anglerfish, Oh My!","This set comes with some awesome new GITD pieces such as teeth. Lego has done a good job on making a more creative set with a ton of alternate models, think about it, what else could you build with a sports set? I was inspired to build a lot more things when I saw the idea book, Jellyfish, Sea Beetles, you can build 'em all. If you don't want any left-over pieces, build the creatures on the front of the box, I assure you, they don't leave any pieces behind. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"karlto","2009-12-28T08:00:01.31Z","Great set","This is a great set, the booklet contains a lot of different models and ideas and the pieces are very useful for building other things as well. The set includes a lot of curved slopes and joints, good for building robots etc.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-09-25T05:23:44.783Z","True Build Animals","True build wildlife and tree designs are always a plus as a builder/collector concern. One piece horses, cows, pigs etc can work great but feel worth so much more when built.<div><br></div><div><b>Brick Beautiful</b></div><div>These sea creatures are a fantastic concept. The Shark is monstrous and obviously a prominent design from the instructions. These bricks; light blue-grey, grey and white are the best bricks in this set. Some fun luminous teeth make any toothed fish or mammal more exciting but honestly there is a lack of realistic colour here. The angler fish is a poor design in my opinion.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Chromatophoric Bioluminescence</b></div><div>The overall model range from the instructions is impressive and comprehensive but as far as best models go, the squid and shark likely stand out. Its just a shame that squids, usually white and pink, and angler fish often dark or black mean that the colours do not quite work on these. The squid is a great model but a red (North Pacific) octopus would have been better or a true colour squid.</div><div><br></div><div>I tried downsizing the shark in height and length for minifigure scale and for a more toothy mouth but found it very difficult and time consuming.&nbsp;I&nbsp;would like to go back to this set and build again for two or three models. Try the translucent/ off white luminescent teeth for making a toothier shark and then research sea creatures to make your own red and own dark blue creations.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Imagination Depth Gauge</b></div><div>I don't like over criticising as an AFOL because these are great bricks for all and as usual its down to what kids can imagine but you may not stretch the parts to make your sea creature in a necessarily realistic colour (apart from any blue, white and grey parts).&nbsp;I see the brick rating as a variable across models that we like at all, so a low rating does not deny that they are still great models and non sea themes can of course be tried out.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We probably would not own a set that we could not give a one brick score? And true build animals are always a very good thing. As it happens the blue-grey and dark blue bricks are so attractive that as parts go it scores tops and holds out as a good set.</div>",TRUE,3,5,3,3,3
