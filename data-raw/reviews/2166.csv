I got this set, and it's a brick treasure chest.  22 white teeth and 23 tan 'claws' really make this set.  This set really plays off of working with different sides of pieces.  I found this set best for building either monsters/dinosaurs or making accents or additions to space MOCs.  Only bad point: needed more large pieces (i.e. dark red wings: one of the few pieces I had to take from my LEGO collection to make my demon).  Overall, great price for great pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-16T20:03:26Z","five stars.  a truly awesome set.","i think that this is a truly awesome set.  the tyrranosuarus in particular is reall cool and i think that everything is very well thought out.  i like the designer sets because lego doesn't just invent all the peices they need, they actualy have to do cool stuff with the peices they've got rather then just making one peice which serves the purpose.  that is what i don't like about most new 
lego, they keep making bigger and bigger peices.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-22T11:35:03Z","Wow!","I really wanted to get a good lego set, but all there was was knight's kingdom (bleh), spider man, and harry potter, and I already have enough bionicle sets.  Also, the good old sets are too much for me to afford on ebay.   Then I saw this; a 39.99 (canadian) set that had 719 pieces!!  All the other sets of the same price had no more that 300 pieces, less than half the amount of this one.  Plus, they are great models of dinosaurs that aren't juniorized.  They are actually proportional (well the stegosaurus could have been bigger), and they have lots of cool new dark red pieces.  The dino island dinos were way too small, then the 10 dollar dinos in cans were still too small, but these are the right size.  
The T-rex is the best model, and when you build him you can have the pteranodon and the stegosaurus at the same time.  But the other 6 models it gives you instructions for can't be built at the same time as another one, so I recommend build the T-rex, pterandon and stego first.  The T-rex is pretty flexible, since he uses new joints.  The teeth and claw pieces are great too.  The T-rex is very delicate though, so little kids shouldn't play with it.  
The pteranodon is a great little dino that flaps his wings and moves his head.
The stego isn't as good as the other two, since he should be bigger, and his head is too big.
THe only other model I built other than the previously mentioned three was the triceratops, and it wasn't that great.  

Overall, I gave it a 9, since it has so many pieces and makes great models.  One point was taken away since some of the models aren't as good as the others, and a few of the pieces aren't useful for building normal buildings.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-06T16:07:53Z","wow","This set is really big for it's price of 40€.Well during the last years there weren't more than 300pcs in sets of that price.And this has 719pcs.Well I looked into the box at first and the Idea Book is big and has 128 pages,which is a lot for a set under 1000pcs!
Well now to some of the Models.
T-Rex: Wow this is a huge model.If this gets into my LEGO Town,then all will be eaten or keep on running scared and out of town.Well it's kinda challenging to build and I like that very much.It took me over 2 hours for this 500-piece beast alone.I made mistakes,which comes from the new colours.Heck it's my first set with parts in the new colour sheme,like Dark red or the new brown and grays.
But the colours are my only little complain at this set.
It's almost perfekt.Well and the dents and claws are awesome and give this a very realistic look.
The Stegosaurus: This is a small model,which looks more like a baby Dinosaur,then an big adult one.And it's not very poseable.
The Pteranodon: Well another small baby dinosaur and without the wings nice food for the T-Rex.But I think the T-rex wants more than that small Pteranodon.
The Crocodile?: This is a nice little creature,which looks good but it lacks posability.
Overall: If you don't have really much money for buying sets,please buy this one.It has a low price per piece (About 0,06€/a piece) and a high piece count.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-10T00:21:07Z","Best Designer Set Yet","After building the majestic Tyranasaurus on the cover of this set, I have to say it is my favorite designer set yet, and I have most of them.  Love the teeth and the ball joint-like hinges, they are much sturdier than the hinges in the previous 2003 designer sets.  Makes them more play worthy so kids can have some fun after they are built.  The Tyranasaur is a little too big though to play with, the tail falls off and then the arms and legs will follow if played with too much by a 6 year old.  The only disappointment with this set:  The colors in the manual do not match the actual colors of the pieces.  The burgundy pieces look brown in the manual and I spent at least 10 minutes looking for that elusive piece before I figured out I was looking for the wrong color.  Other than that, this is probably the most affordable set for the number of pieces you get, and it would make any dinosaur fan happy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I got it at toys &quot;r&quot; us, the last one in stock. I bought it for exactly $29.99. $29.99 is a really good deal so I say if you're going to buy this set, you should get it $29.99. It's worth the money! The new coloured pieces are dark red, tan, and I think brown and light brown. I really recommend this set because it is really cool. You should get it. I had lots of fun with this, Lego really did a great job. You can have all three dinosaurs built at the same time. You can have the pterandon, the stegosaurus, and the mighty t-rex all built together. The tan - coloured claws are cool and the white - coloured teeth and sweet. Oh yeah I forgot to mention there are also new pieces. So just like I said up above, you can't judge what you see on the box until you've got it.

Everything's great about this set, the t-rex model is excellent, it stands up pretty well, and it's the right size for a minifigure. I enjoyed this so much! I bought it with my own money about 5 weeks ago and I'm still playing with it right now. $45 dollars or less for new coloured pieces, different pieces, white coloured teeth, tan coloured claws, a instruction big that has about 60 pages, 719 pieces, HECK GO GET IT!

Anyway, it's pretty good, but I would've like instructions for the 'advanced' woolly mammoth. You get lots of instructions for the simple models and only 2 for the complex models.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-02T17:08:24Z","I LOVE THIS SET!!!","This is one of my most favorite lego set. It's really really cheap and it's really really good and it's really really cool. As you can see IM A DINOSAUR FAN just like my name!! It's cheap because there's 719 pieces for just $39.99(CAD)!! I know there's a bucket that's $29.99(CAD) that has 1000 pieces, but so what!?!? You can build the mighty tyrannosaurus rex with this set! I just wish that they made more colours. I hope they also make a new black t-rex. I'm a big lego fan and I'm also a big dinosaur fan. When I was very very little, people called me the dinosaur-king because I always brought my little dino toys with me everywhere I went. And now lego has just released the perfect toy! This T-rex can move it's jaw, head and tail. You can build 9 models. The Instruction Book also gives you instructions to build 9 more models and then it also shows pictures ofthese other 26 models which you can build. You can build a triceratops, a crocodile, a pterandon, a stegasarus and much more...You can also build the t-rex, the stegasaurs and the pterandon at the same time. You have enough pieces to build all three. I always use my t-rex to chomp up the stegasaurus! And the little birdy pterandon makes a good dessert for the t-rex. the t-rex has NO PROBLEM standing up on its two legs if you know how to make him stand up in a good angle. i am 11 years old and i love lego. 

ALSO IMPORTANT: remember, i dont think this set is for like 6 yeared olds and younger. it is very fragile, if your're careful with it, then you can play with the lego t-rex just like you play a video game! I recommend this set for about 7 years and older to whatever age! thank-you",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

HOPE LEGO MAKES MORE DINOSAURS!

Ok, well here's how my story went.


I bought the Lego Prehistoric creatures for my 5-and-a-half year old son as a reward for his effort towards nighttime potty training. The training failed, but he did well with the Legos; he has always been a Lego fan. Even though this Lego set is advertised for age 7+, I figured it was no harder than the easier ones my son had done in the past, except maybe it took longer. (At the time of this writing, Amazon says the toy is for 6+, but you can see right on that picture of the box that it says 7+). 

As it turned out, my son had much difficulty in the beginning. He didn't pay enough attention to the instructions, and while he could get away with it in the smaller legos, the big T-Rex required more precision and made him cry in frustration. I told him that he needed to follow the instructions exactly, and I had to fix his mistake several time before he finally finished the T-Rex. Since it stood on two legs, he had trouble making it stand and needed my help again. He spent a total of about 10 hours building it, and while he was proud and relieved when it was done, he declared he would never build the T-Rex again; it was too hard. 

The very next day, my son forgot his resolution and decided to tackle the T-Rex project again. This time, he did much better, and finished without any help from me, plus he figured out how to get it to stand too. He was then very proud. This time, it only took him maybe 4 hours. 

My son has since spent morning, noon and night building and rebuilding Lego dinosaurs. (The other dinosaurs aren't half as hard or big as the T-Rex.) It's been a week, and he's still enjoying it. In terms of the amount of enjoyment it produced, this Lego set is worth double its money. I highly recommend this product to anyone, although I suggest that the child has some experience with easier Legos first. If your child is a dinosaur fan but has never played Legos, I recommend the Legos Wild Collection for practice, with which they can build all sorts of animals. The Wild Collection is recommended for 6+, but my son had no trouble playing it on his fifth birthday, and it was his first Lego set. In fact, I think even four year olds could have done it if they enjoy mechanical toys. My son can't read but has no trouble following the picture step-by-step instructions. 

Tips: 

1. Get an utitility box (a craft box with numerous divided compartments) from a hardware store and sort out the pieces by color and size for your kid (under 7). There are 700+ pieces and your child will go crazy searching if everything is just one huge pile. The Lego wild collection comes with a tool to help taking the Legos apart (the dinosaur Lego doesn't), and the job isn't too boring if you do it in front of the TV. 
2. Before you kid starts playing, take a good stapler, open it up (there's usually a catch under a stapler to let you straighten it from a narrow &quot;V&quot; shape to a &quot;---&quot;) and staple the instruction book as many times as you can alone its spine. If you don't, the center pages are going to come out starting the first day. The Lego people put only two staples in the wide 117-page dinosaur instruction book, and it won't hold no matter how careful your child is. I wish I had thought of this sooner, and the Wild collection instruction book wouldn't be in the 10 different pieces right now, despite my frequent effort with scotch tape. 

Considering how many happy hours my son has spent with the Legos, I want to say &quot;bravo!&quot; to the Lego designers who came up with such wonderful, enduring toys. Keep up the good work!

I bought the old ones and they were pretty small. But now, these are the right size! This is a great wonderful set! The head could move, the tail could move, the jaw could move and even the legs and hands could move! It's a red t-rex as you could see on the box, and there's about 719 pieces. It's says 7+ becuase it'll probably be a bit fragile for 6 years and under. It's about $30 US and $40 CAD.

My son just turned 6 and has been slowly warming up to the joys of LEGOs. I bought him this set because he needs step-by-step directions to build things...he finds it hard to create things on his own. The directions were mostly easy for him to follow once I taught him to look for the visual &quot;clues&quot; in each step. He loved the different dinosaur models. We haven't had any problems with them standing...they look fantastic! I'm just so happy that he's FINALLY enjoying LEGOs! I was starting to wonder what was &quot;wrong&quot; with him!!! I learned he needs instructions with steps, and this was perfect for him. 

Now my 4 year old daughter can create things on her own, and with this set she looked at the pictures and then designed her own models. So it works for either type of kid. Great set. I plan on getting the other sets similar to this one. To the fine folks at LEGO, I thank you!

It is one amazing kit. He will be busy for months building all the ideas that came in the booklet.

I buy lego castles, pirates, jets, star wars, I made my own lego world and sometimes I rate them. But this one, is amazing! I have to say this is the best out of all my lego sets! 

Although a little confusing to build, it's worth the stress! It's also worth the money too! $40.00 for 719 pieces! I think that Prehistoric Creatures is worth double the money! It's incredible and really interesting once you get into it. The tyrannosarus is big. It's about 48 cm long and over 22 cm tall. You can build a stegosaurus, pterandon, crocodile, 2 versions os a long neck, a tricerotop, some flying creature, and some other dinosaur with spikes on it's back because it gives you inctructions for them. The thing about this is that once you're finished building the t-rex, there's still enough pieces to build the pterandon and the stegosaurus at the same time. So you could have all 3 of them built at the same time. The stegosaurus and the pterandon are just fine. The legs, tail, jaw, head, hands and feet can all move.

You can make a bracheosaurus, a stegosaurus, a bat, this creature with spikes on it's back, a crocodile, a pterandon, a tricertop and much much more...There's alot more to discover on what you see on the box.

There's a lot of nice instructions and several 'idea' models in the instructions. 

Lots of Bley and Reddish Brown, but they look good together. The carnivore is a good size to terrorize your minifigs- not quite as big as the Technic one from the Control Centre set, but pretty big.

Click hinges make him posable, but just barely- most poses don't balance well on a table. You could attach him to a base for displays, though.

Construction is interesting without being overly challenging. Lots of unusual design ideas, and a good selection of parts for non-traditional (SNOT) building. Parts are included to build several of the models at once, which is a nice bonus.

In short, LEGO has released a winner in my opinion, and at a bargain price. If you are considering buying this set- buy it!

"legoicsav79","2008-08-08T02:57:13.123Z","All Hail.. The Mighty T-Rex"," There was no way in the world I would've let this one slip me, I picked it up the moment it hit the stores. Good Lego Sets are hard to come by in this part of the world.

 Building the main model was sheer fun, enjoyed every bit of the built. The legs &amp; tail are a little flimsy, but overall this one looks mean. The head is the best part in the whole build, had to fill up the body since it was hollow from within. Overall it is very well detailed.

 I haven't took the model apart till date, it says it all, I really adore this set &amp; so do all my pals, It stands tall above all other Lego display in my shelf. You could call it my Lego Trophy

"Smallsam99","2008-07-03T13:53:22.7Z","A set worth buying!","This lego set is part of the creator line and one of the best sets they ever made! First off this set can make about 7 different models and includes very rare red and dark red pieces along with tan pieces. The models are nicely built and are realistic. The only problem is the t-rex which legs are very unstable and can fall very easily. There is not really much else to say but the piece count is worth the price. I reccommend this set for the rare pieces it includes and the best dinosaur models lego made.Overall it is about an 8/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Fully functional models
very detailed models
totally wicked awesome!

cons:
none, obviously

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Rare colours!</li><li>Lots of opening parts!</li><li>Awesome detail!</li><li>Lots of ideas and models!</li><li>Lots of different bricks!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The&nbsp;Tyrannosaurus Rex is unstable and falls on his nose sometimes.&nbsp;</li><li>The toes on the T. Rex fall off sometimes.</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>As you can see, it&nbsp;was&nbsp;a very good set. There are lots of opening jaws, swinging arms, etc. The T. Rex is my favourite and most beautiful dinosaur. It rarely falls down, but not that often. Just let him lie on his side for a few days, and then the legs will be able to give him more support.&nbsp;</p><p>The colours and the detail in this set are amazing. For example, look at how much crimson red bricks there are in this model!</p><p>The other Dinosaurs do look cool, but the T. Rex beats them. Only once I tried to rebuild the model to the Triceratops (the next advanced model in this set) but it didn't please me and then it was back to the main model.</p><p>Overall, get this set. (I don't think I need to say anything else!)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
