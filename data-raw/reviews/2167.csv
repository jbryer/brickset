"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-23T19:54:00Z","Best in 2004","This is simply awsome, i got the set  today and this has got to be one of the best sets i have ever bought, this thing is like a foot tall. on the site it says its like 11 inches, and has a good selektion of mech joints, duh its a mech set. my summary is GET THIS SET",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-26T19:05:00Z","","This is great. The new joints are too hard too move very fast but they are very good for posing. The big robot uses almost all the pieces. Theres like 10 to 20 left over. Its very heavy and tall, like 1 foot and 4 er 5 inches. I dont no i didnt measure but it shure is tall.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-26T18:34:34Z","Impressive, yet....","Pro's:
It's big, has nice styling and contains lots of usefull pieces.

Con's:
Terrible colors, red instead of the orange and a darker shade of blue would be better

Slightly oversized feet and the worst possible hands

The joint connecting the upper and lower body is too loose, it should have more friction for better posing

A bit too fragile, keep away from little kids or it will be in pieces soon.

Still, a very nice set. Lego should release more of these kinds of sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

PROS:
It's big. Really big. Really, really big.
The new grey actually suits the model very well, IMHO.
Good posability.
Looks cool. I know this is basic, but it really does. 
The backpack is very well done, in particular.
The new &quot;round&quot; clicky hinges are good for mechs.
Did I mention it's big?

CONS:
The head is too small.
Legs for hands. Eeeeeewwwww....
Quite fragile.

The only problem is that the main model, the Titan XP is far to flimsy. but i found that if you turn it around and take off the circle head you have another robot. This is the one thats on the back.

The colors are nice (I must be the only guy who likes the Ice Planet colors).  The robot main model is very impresive but VERY fragile.  Had this been a 'normal' model I would have taken off a point, but there are many robots and it has an ABUNDANCE of bricks; I really like those 1x3 curves, I would love a supplimentary pack of just those in basic colors.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-17T22:36:52Z","Too big, too bad.","I'll admit, it has a certain appeal when seeing it in the store.  That's an awful lot of bricks going on right there.  And the alternate designs &amp; idea book look cool.  But that's about where the coolness stops.
It's kinda repetitive to build (ie not fun).  I's almost impossible t play with because it's so fragile, and can't support it's own weight.  It can strike some pretty darn cool poses though.  If you can get it to stay there.
Maybe this is just me, but I had a heck of a time understanding Lego's color mastering skills when going thought the book.  the 2 greys &amp; blue looked very much alike, and the orange was yellow in the book.
Finally, the head doesn't turn.  4 seperate movalbe skirts of armor articulate, but the head doesn't move.  That's weak.
The only reason I gave it more than a 3 is because it does have shock value, is imposing &amp; impressive, and is pretty articulate.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-17T20:13:17Z","Not bad...","Pretty good model with the fact that its constructed with little to none technic pieces. The only SAD part about this set are the hands of the robot. Lego figure legs??!!! Give me a break. The head should have been bigger too. I bet LEGO can do better than that. However, if you're interested in the coolness of this model, go buy it. Quite worth the money.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T03:35:56Z","Very impressive","I really like this set a lot. The colour scheme is so perfect. Especially the orange colour here and there. 

It is a nice display set together with 4097 (Mini robots), 4099 (Robobots) and 4881 (Robo Platoon). 

However, I would like to deduct 0.5 because of the joint between the upper and lower body. Once, I was holding the upper body of it (without supporting the lower one), the whole lower body dropped onto the floor. After re-building it, the joints of the lower body have become loose. If it is not well positioned, it will fall down (unlike before, i could bend it whatever way i like).

Why? I'm going to unleash my inner geek to explain. 

- PROS OF MODEL: -

A) It stands over a foot high
B) It has great gray and black pieces
C) It has no weaponary, which, I am led to assume, is why most people hated it
D) Leg design is creative and very cool looking
E) Most body parts are movable
F) Detachable jetpack
G) It's hard to build. That's a PRO, folks. It's good to have a set that requires some brainpower and some talent. NOTE THE AGE RANGE ON THE BOX. If you are below that level, don't expect to have fun with it. 

- CONS OF MODEL - 

A) Head often falls off.
B) It's rather shaky, not recommended for rigorous play

The build is tedious for the legs, but once you have them done, they look AMAZING.

<p>It came quickly and i decided to sit down and build it last night, which took two sittings and about 3hours (or so) had to stop and strecth legs a few times.</p>
<p>The main robot is amazing and is huge.&nbsp; The only concern is the fact that it's a little top heavy and looks like it may fall over at any min.&nbsp; Not sure if that's due to my parts being used before ir just a design flaw.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just your normal stuff, nothing special.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of similar&nbsp;&nbsp;parts, but nothing really out of the ordinary today. Has some unique parts in sand blue and orange, so if you need parts in those colors, this set could be for you.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I only built the main model, cause once it was built, it looked so cool I couldn&#39;t&nbsp;destroy it. Simple techniques used to good effect, some snot. Took me maybe 2 hours.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is where it really shines. The final model looks powerful and imposing, just as a robot should. It is a little flimsy around the waist, so if you want to play with it I suggest you build one of the other two models. This giant looks great towering over a car or minifig, or just standing around. I highly recommend it to robot fans and people who just want to display it, as it is a impressive model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set, in case you couldn&#39;t tell. My only problems with it are a flimsy waist and the fact that the head is&nbsp;a little small, but it doesn&#39;t bother me much. I think this designers really hit the jackpot with this set, and I wish they would do more like this in the&nbsp;future. Preferably even bigger than this one.</p>
