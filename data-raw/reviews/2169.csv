It also has a good use of the window pieces as well. it also has nice lights that work and cool minifigs. the problem is that it doesn't have enough cars, has an okay looking station, and not enough track",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-05T08:08:53Z","A poorly designed set","I don't know who designed this traqin but their brain must have been on vacation. The only reason I gave it a 6 was because it had good form. this set is poorly designed. It has no doors. What are the passengers supposed to do, climb through the windows. The driver also cannot get in. I never understood why lego ever switched from the classic style of train, such as the 1996 cargo railway, and the freight and crane railway.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-14T17:18:59Z","Can go very quick: ","I have two of these sets with motors front and back, lights removed from rear unit, and it is the only unit that can go into a corner at full speed and not tip over with no added weights added in the bottom, which slow the trains down anyway or throw any bits off like the 4559. So really is a true bullet train.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Tom","2005-05-21T05:54:28Z","a missed opportunity","A good looking innovation but with enough bad points : 1) no doors neither for passengers nor driver. 2) the luggage container matches with the 4512 freight containers but is a poor thing on a passenger train , when you buy 2 sets of the 4511 and put them together , it looks rather odd to have 2 luggage compartments and it blocks the connections between the passenger waggons 3) the connection between the drivers canopy and the train frame is not a line but there is a step.
good points are nice colours and a modern design, not just a copy of another previous passenger train. ( most of the freight locs are all quite alike )",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-04-01T13:32:54.89Z","More thought should have been put into this.","After building this train you can't help but think ""where's the rest of it?""  There only seem to be the front and middle sections.  As such the piece-count is pathetically small.  Though it looks all hi-tec and has an unusual colour scheme, the front is quite hideously ugly.  And do people wanting to get on and off this train walk through the walls?  I can see no other way for the minifigs to board and depart.  The platform is small but serves its purpose and there are plenty of useful pieces, but it's just ""another train"" rather than anything special or exceptional.

"legotrainfan","2007-02-05T15:27:46.537Z","The design could be better","The design of this passenger train could be better. The front piece is too big. The train doesn't have doors and the other half of the train is simply missing, namely set 10157. And, unfortunately, set 10157 comes with those new grey colours, whereas this set was still made with the old grey colours. What a mess!

I also believe that the container is unnecessary for such a passenger train. It only makes the passenger car shorter and uses the space actually needed for the connections between the waggons. And without the connections the whole thing doesn't like nice. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mhoeij","2010-04-21T10:14:57.513Z","Nice light weight train.","What was good about this train set is that the cars and end-locomotive were sold separately, so you<br>get to choose how many cars you want. Another good thing about this train is that the cars are light<br>weight, so a single 9V motor can pull many of them. My train is 5 feet long (front/back engine and four<br>cars in between) and the motor has no problems to pull this train to high speeds.&nbsp; The light weight will<br>make the motor last for a much longer time than a motor pulling for instance a Santa Fe train.<br><br>It is of course true that if you only have this set and no additional cars or back engine, then it's not going to look good on the track.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Zapp_Brannigan","2009-08-21T19:51:49.217Z","Fast!","This was the first train I've received for Christmas. I was very excited to set up everything and see it run. Unfortunately, a friend derailed the train and broke the motor, but we ordered a new one. Here's what I think.

Pros:

-6 speeds going forward/backward
-Fast! (be cautious of derailment)
-Weight does not affect train speed
-Lights really work
-Nothing extra to buy
-Speed Regulator
-Front of the train is sleek, not one large piece but many pieces
-Cockpit has detailed set of controls
-Chairs, tables and cups inside
-Roof easy to lift off to access interior
-Cargo hold
-Ticket and suitcases
-Train schedule
-Comes with engineer and 2 passengers

Cons:

-Train feels incomplete without a back locomotive (one similar to the front one)
-Train station is plain and small
-No straight rails
-Speed regualator is cumbersome

In addition, the train doesn't have doors but it doesn't really matter, after all as long as it works that's good. Overall great train, works perfectly, but more work needed for the station and back locomotive needed.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lolbrick","2009-11-13T09:01:18.747Z","Weakest Lego Train Set.","Now I got this for christmas and I gotta say it is really oddly designed... like I've never seen an Ace german green-line styled train with only one locomotive or whatever kind of model they try to mimic... but that's the only model I could think off.

It has no doors, and extreamly cheap detailed on the inside and the Cargo container? What were they thinking?
But I gotta give this set abit of credit after all, although I do not like the particular design on the front, I do like the front window, very aerodynamic.
Also, the ticket was a smart idea and the secret agent badge...
mediocre station.

You can do way better Lego... what happened to the ol' Metroliner spirit?",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

<br />
Il n'a pas de portes, et extreamly &eacute;conomiques d&eacute;taill&eacute;es &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur et le conteneur? Que faisaient-ils penser?<br />
Mais je dois donner cette s&eacute;rie ABIT du cr&eacute;dit apr&egrave;s tout, bien que je n'aime pas le design particulier sur le front, je n'aime le pare-brise, tr&egrave;s a&eacute;rodynamique.<br />
