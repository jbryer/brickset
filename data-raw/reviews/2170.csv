"A_Brickset_user","2003-09-02T00:00:00Z","","I just received this set today and just finished assembling it.  First of all, let me say that this is a COMPLETE set.  This is how sets should come: train, motor, light, track + point, transformer, wire, and accessories (complete).  Yes, the price is $140, but well worth it if you figure what all the parts run separately - although I knew Lego would combine this with the cargo crane (4514) as a kit at just $3 more.  This always happens when I buy sets separately (see my review of 4514).
I debated over buying the Metroliner kit or this for well over a month.  Having finally picked this, I am happy with my choice.
The green/dark gray color combo for engine, box car, and flat car is excellent.  I like the engine design a lot as well as the box car.  In fact, the box car is my favorite complete with sliding doors, train doors, and a single 2-stud wide black window at it's front end.  Love the gold bars!  This box car and engine is actually what sold me on the set.  The red tipper car is neat, esp. the assembly, and the flat bed car just OK.  The set also includes a working forklift and bumper stop that I think just be produced as a single set.  
AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: The box car and flat car have wheel sets directly next to each other (no space) - just like the Santa Fe Cars.  This seems to add friction with the black wheels.  The box car took me a couple of tries to build.  One additional stud layer over the sliding door frames would have made connecting the roof pieces easier.  Seems to fall apart if not held just right when connecting. The doors on the box car have no sticker, just a green stripe.  This is great, but the 3X4 gray pieces on the engine require a sticker.  Why not do the same thing with these?  The engine has no door or easy access for your minifigs.  You have to take off the roof to place the figure and it doesn't come off easily.
WHAT I LIKE BEST: The box car (as mentioned above) and what you get offers a lot of playability.  Unique pieces include the gold bars, the forklift piece, the new buffers for the engine, and a few others plus a lot of green pieces.  The engine also offers the choice of connecting a red light at the back or yellow in the front.  This is a great set and although I missed out on the free cargo crane, this set is worth $140 in my book.  I hope others enjoy it as much as I do!

I bought this train (and not the high speed train, I'll explain why) for my daughter (and me !) because you find in only 1 box everything you need to enjoy building and playing with a train (a huge layout, different kind of cars, I love the box car, with cool colors, cool minifigs, and the gold bars !). One thing is really amazing : it's only in the new &quot;Cargo Train&quot; set that you can get the old good passengers doors from the Metroliner set and not in the new &quot;Passenger Train&quot; set...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-25T11:32:16Z","Great introduction to the Train Series!","As a newbie to the LEGO train sets, I must say I'm impressed. This set includes everyting you need to get everything out of the train set. Train motor, power regulator, train light, and a spur track. 

The set is fairly easy to build and is enjoyable. The engine looks good and has pretty good details. The other cars are fine, but could have included more details in the interior of the freight box car. The cargo containers are nice but I've personally never seens any containers like that; must be a European thing. The smaller red car is cool, but can't really figure out what kind of cargo would be dumped on the railway tracks. Maybe gravel? Maybe I'm a traditionalist but I wish they had inclued some of the &quot;My Train Set&quot; cars (tanker, open freight car, hopper) instead of the new looking cargo cars. The forklift is OK and I applause the intresting use of the two seat parts. 

The one drawback is that the freight box car is rather flimsy. The roof comes off way too easy. Be ready to repeatedly rebuild this car if a smaller child is playing with this set. This can be remedied with the addition of a few 1 x ? plates.

Overall a great set and highly playable.

It&#180;s really a great set strating your lego-train experience. It consits of a very well designed locomotive and three (!) cargo cars. That means a good playability is guaranteed. You can play with only one set, for it has a great number of tracks and even a switching track. Using the forklift you can load/unload the boxes. But the best of all are the gold pieces. Our favourite playing theme ist railway robbery...
Don&#180;t miss this set!
(For more playability, this Christmas we will add the train engine shed - and I am really looking forward to it)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-11T17:36:38Z","Improvments Needed","I like everything on the train but the boxcar doors. When I lift the boxcar off the track a hard squeeze will make the freight doors fall in. I hate that because I have to take the roof off and put them back on. I also don't like that the spring on the forklift lets you make the blades come off the bottom. One time I lost the spring but after 30 minutes I found it. I really like the control patern piece that goes in the engine.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-05T15:57:03Z","Excellent set","Got this set one week ago. This is my first train set. I'm into technic lego since my childhood. I never thought to buy a train. Bu t when i saw this set my interest in train sets began. I examined all 9V sets (past present). My favorite set are 4564 and this one. I thought to buy a second hand 4564 from bricklink but 4512 set has superiorities to 4564. A double bogie box car with traim doors, A double bogie flatbed, bigger track, switch point and a light brick. Then i decided to buy this set. It has everything you expect from a lego train set. The design of the locomotive and the box car is excellent, the flatbed and the hopper are OK. The set has a nice color scheme. The design of the forklift is nice to (and the usage of minifig seat as mudguards for forklift truck deserves an applause !!). ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-22T09:01:06Z","Perfect","This was my first train set, and I am very happy with it.  I think that if you are going to buy a train, buy this one.  It includes everything you need to get started, like the motor, speed regulator, light, and track.  The engine is extremely well designed and is very strong.  The box car on the back is very cool, and although it can fall apart, as long as you don't grab it by the sliding doors it won't.  The other two cars are simple, but they are great.  The hopper car works well, although there are two stickers that cover multiple pieces.  I didn't put those ones on.  That is my one and only dislike.  The flatbed carrier holds the cargo very well, and the forklift can easily remove and load the cargo.

I like the design of the forklift.  It is very easy to play with and holds cargo well.  It is compatible with the cargo from the cargo crane.

There is so much you can do with a LEGO train.  I suggest you get this set, as well as extra track.  I have recently added the cargo crane and the engine shed to my layout, and combined they make a great setup to play with.  I also enjoyed interfacing my train with the LEGO Mindstorms RCX, to make it operate autonomously.  This set is the perfect set to play with, put on display, or add on to something you already have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-08-21T04:26:55.613Z","9V forever!","this was actually my very first lego set that i bought. for myself. as a grown up person. non, je ne regrette rien. i think they've done everything right with this set, its quite perfect. 

the box car may be a bit unstable, but there's a nice gag involved: one tile on the box car, which is a gold transport, shows a &quot;franz j&#228;ger&quot;-label. &quot;franz j&#228;ger&quot; is a fictive producer of safes in the danish &quot;olsen banden&quot;-movies (kind of criminal comedies). so here you have an actual reference to the world outside the lego-universe, which is quite rare in non-sw/hp/spiderman/whatever licensed product lines.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-11-25T05:25:43.263Z","Best set for newbies to LEGO trains","This set is simply brilliant! This has been the only set for beginners that comes with a switch! When you want to change the way the train goes, you must use the yellow lever of the switch. In comparison with the 9V switches that could be bought several years earlier, I find the switch mechanism works much smoother with this switch. LEGO must have improved the mechanism. 

The buffer stop is also very nice! I think that set 4553 (Train Wash) is the only set that has a buffer stop as well. I don't have set 4553 yet, but when I look at the pictures, I find the buffer stop of 4512 much better. 

The diesel engine comes with a light in the front. There's no light in the engine's back. I mean no light that is powered by electricity from the motor. Maybe this could be changed with some alterations, though I don't know how difficult this is. I've never tried. Somehow the engine often derails because of the cable between the light brick and the 9V motor. Especially when it goes fast, it sometimes leaves the tracks. Through the cable to the light brick, the movements of the motor are a bit limited when it goes into a curve. I strictly assemble such sets according to the building instructions. I'll have to check if I wasn't sloppy. Maybe I didn't assemble it correctly so the engine always derails. But I am not sure. I think it's more a general problem and not a construction error. 

You get three waggons with containers and some other freight material. For the containers you get a forklift. The gold bars are also something special. Be careful with the forklift's spring! It can be worn out within some years when you play with it too much. So far I have not been able to get the spring as a replacement part for older forklifts. I don't know where to get such small springs. 

You get the locomotive driver in many other sets. That is quite annoying when you have so many minifigs that are absolutely identical. At least, LEGO could have used different faces for him. 

There is also a speed regulator. It would have been nice if LEGO had produced two versions of this set: one with the speed regulator and one without it. Without it the price would certainly have been lower. They did this with set4560/4561. I don't know why they can't do it with other train sets as well.

I don't like the new hinge bricks. Of course, they are more robust than the old hinge plates. But the old hinge plates do not need as much space as the new ones. 

Anyway, this set is ideal for those who have not yet got a train set. If you buy it, you won't be disappointed. With this set alone you can play many hours.
