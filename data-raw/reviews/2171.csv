"A_Brickset_user","2003-01-31T00:00:00Z","","I really like the looks of this set attractive round canopied windows set in with some stricking architectural features such as those tall beams and curvey roof adding up to a beuatiful modern building with a revolving door and a cafe on the roof! What more could you want?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-22T15:09:01Z","I miss the old stations!","Well, I broke down and bought this set only to realize it's not much better then the picture on the box. The set is definately a modern station with large unique curved windows, revolving door, and the strangest roof I've ever seen on a Lego structure. I know Lego designers were going for a modern look, but this set is more odd than modern. 
WHAT I DO LIKE: the set has some nice parts for the train theme and the three-section base is definately useful. I also like the smoked 3x4 windows. Good assortment of mini-figs including the pizza guy and skateboarder w/old space emblem. OVERALL: this set doesn't compare with the older train stations but since I needed a station, this one will have to do.  I'd love to see Lego design a $99 station more like Grand Central with arches and older architecture.  Now that would be a station! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-06T15:41:08Z","Nice Station","This is a very good train station, compared to the red one from 1999.It's not juniorized and has a cool look.The 5 Minifigs look nicely detailed and the skateboarder has an classic space jacket.I like the detailed interior,but what's up with the computers?They seem too transparent for being good.And the small restaurant area lacks chairs inside,which comes from the small room.Well the chairs are on the second floor,but outside.So if it's raining the guests get wet.And the Pizza seems to be uncooked,because it's tan.Hey TLC I want a yellow one not this tan one.
Well I don't like the roof as it is.The glass slopes should be lowered a brick's height,because this seems a little bit odd.
BTW I like this revolving door,and I'll maybe copy or take it out of the station for a MOC in future.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"David1985","2007-11-28T21:54:04.403Z","Nice Train Station","I bought this set (4513) a few years ago after getting my first, and only working, Lego Train.  So of course I needed a train station.

The set is well built, and nice and big, it feels like a station a real city would have.  It has a slight &quot;future&quot; feel to it that all Lego World City sets have.  It's also nice that it has 3 raised plates, as the station release before it.

The inside is very nice, there is a cargo and ticket area on one side, and a cafe on the other side of the first floor.  The second floor has an eating area and the computer controls.

The pieces are great, I love the round windows, and it comes with two scopes of ice cream in the set.  

The only cons I can think of is why is it yellow?  And why are there no woman?! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-01-08T09:52:03.873Z","come on, its not so bad!","during the christmas vacation i just had time to build this set again, and i was as pleased as i always was. of course there are some things that are not perfect (weird roof, huge slopes), but the modern look with big round windows fits my taste - we live in the 21. century!
the minifig-selection ist excellent, and the interieur very detailed and functional - just look at the baggage car that can be loaded via the tiltable window... ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-10T17:41:56.497Z","Wow","I got this set for my birthday in 2004, and it was amazing! The set includes five minifigs, two computers, train map (on 2nd floor), arrivals/departures display board, cafe, pizza, two ice cream cones, drink dispensers, cash register, suitcases, envelope, ticket, luggage car, traffic tools, traffic light, control room and cargo room. What I like most is the revolving doors, pizza and special window pieces. Yes it's a perfect set, except for one thing. My city doesn't have any trains, and there's no need for any, so instead, I turned this set into a seven storey restaurant. Overall, the price is a tad too much, but the set is awesome. There is a lot of opportunity for alternative building.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-05-11T13:14:58.84Z","A great set.","This is a great-looking station, has been imaginatively designed and comes with plenty of useful features such as a restaurant, ticket office, control room and a vehicle for carrying the luggage.  There are also some interesting minifigs, including one on a skateboard, and attention is paid to detail.  The revolving doors are also an inspired design.  Without doubt the best railway station of recent years.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"no_skill","2010-01-23T03:24:40.153Z","Only Average","This is not a bad set, but it is only average.

The aesthetics are a matter of personal preference.  However, there is really nothing else with similar architecture in ‘official’ town, making the station seem out of place.

On the ground floor there is a nice snack-bar as well as a ticket booth/luggage check.  There is a luggage shoot from the ticketing area to a car awaiting outside…good idea, but I found the execution only so-so.

On the top floor there is a control room and some seating areas, but not a restaurant, so why the chef?  

The revolving door is a very nice touch, but it does not overcome the juniorization that I felt was fairly pervasive throughout the set (lots of wall panels).
