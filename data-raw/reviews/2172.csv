"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-06T09:16:17Z","nice !","I own this set so I'm doing a review to counter the people who are just about things they don't even know.
I really like this set, it is an awesome set that is working really well. it's quite cheap comparred to other LEGO sets, and I like the Idea to include a vehicule in the set.
Maybe they could make one for the 4511 train because this one is designed for the cargo train",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T10:50:42Z","A great set!","I recently got this set, and although it is somewhat simple, I really like it.  The crane has a great design.  The winch can go up and down and also forward and backward.  The cargo is compatible with the Cargo Train and its forklift.  In fact, this is a perfect set to go with the Cargo Train.  The colout schemes are the same, and the truck and the forklift look and work great together.  If you are going to buy the Cargo Train, you should definitly get the combo pack that includes this for just a few dollars more.  It is well worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

apart from that it is a very good set, quickly built, lots of standard parts, and a (only) 4-wide car.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Dylricho","2007-07-19T15:23:21.67Z","forklift","where is the forklift in the box picture?
and by the way, the forklift is the best and the easiest vehicle
in this set, because it looks so small. the crane has not got much finger room when you turn the winch, and the truck is just too small.
i think more containers must be included too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"HaulingBricks","2023-04-04T15:21:46.51Z","Cargo Crane 4514","<p>Cargo Crane 4514 is a decent set.&nbsp; I like the crane quite a bit but could honestly do without the rest of the set.</p>

<p>The building experience is fantastic on most of this set.&nbsp; The construction of the crane itself is interesting and fairly&nbsp;rewarding once you get the string installed and start playing with it.&nbsp; The assembly of the &quot;truck&quot; and cargo is underwhelming and almost feels like an afterthought.</p>

<p>The part usage isn&#39;t too bad given the fact this set came out in 2005 when World City was transitioning to City.&nbsp; The large crane legs are always nice to have.</p>

<p>Playability is really where this set shines.&nbsp; The crane functions very well and is just fun to use.&nbsp; I just wish there had been a better truck to accompany the set, as the small cargo truck included isn&#39;t very exciting.</p>

<p>Overall, a nice set but definitely something you&#39;d get to bolster an existing train layout or harbour and not something you&#39;d pick up as a standalone set.</p>
