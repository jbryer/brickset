So if you have a train and wish you could have a larger layout, get some track.  It's well worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-05T12:27:58.437Z","Simple way to make your train set bigger","I got two of this set and made a huge oval and mounted it on a 4'x8' piece of plywood and screwed down the track. My kids could play with the train without the hassle of putting it together and taking it apart. Easy way to expand you rail service in your Lego town.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-11-25T10:16:30.483Z","Self-explanatory","It is self-explanatory why straight tracks are needed unless you insist on having a very small track layout. Maybe the oval of a beginners set is sufficient for you. But with some straight rails you can extend your track layout. You can create sidings (as long as you have switches, of course). They are ideal when you don't want your locomotive to pull all waggons. Straight rails are always necessary. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
