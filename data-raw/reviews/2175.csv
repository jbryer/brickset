"legotrainfan","2007-11-28T13:26:25.843Z","90 degrees","This is a 90 degree rail crossing. For model railways there are 10 and 15 degree crossing. By using them you can build quite complex shunting areas; shunting areas that are impossible to build with this rail crossing. You can only use it to build bigger or smaller loops for which you need lots of curved rails. 

I must admit I expect much from LEGO. LEGO trains have been designed for children. So it's no surprise that 10 and 15 degree rail crossings do not exist. And somehow you'll definitely find a way to integrate this piece of rail in your track layout. 

I sometimes ask myself why this set was released so late. The first 9V trains and rails were available in 1991. This set could be bought for the first time in 1999. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It is true that the chances of derailment are higher with this rail crossing, there is an easy way to fix this;

just place your locomotive,or wagon up side down and push all the trainwheels outwards from each other on the axle.lego solved thislater on by changing the design of the wheels a little bit.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
