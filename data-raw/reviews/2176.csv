<br />
Around the time I built this fine vehicle I saw an interview with the head of LEGO&#39;s U.S. division on&nbsp;television. While he answered the reporter&#39;s questions I noticed that the sole LEGO on his executive office desk was the Mobile Ground Tracking Station. If that does not make this set one for the history books, I do not know what else would!<br />

It has a spinny radar on top and a radar dish behind. The back opens up and it has a little console to tinker on. Simply, it’s the greatest little portable space wardrobe imaginable. You can drive it. You can sit in the back and contact your associates. When the reception gets bad, you can fiddle with the radars. Awesome playability in such a little set. 

I remember getting this set when it was new, assembling on the cafeteria table at the shopping centre. The laminex instantly became the lunar surface, and I was there.

It would have been nice if the minifig could fit inside with the doors closed but I guess there was no need for that in the pre-alien Lego days. Hinged Lego pieces were a stroke of genius, mine from this set were used for houses, castles with a secret door and the 8th wonder of the world, the &quot;Gateway to Legoland&quot;.

Con: That oxygen tank on the front of all the early moon buggies was really annoying, they'd never stay on so it always ended up being a spare oxygen tank for non-astronaut visitors from Legoland.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-17T22:09:29.06Z","Exactly what it says it is","This is mobile tracking station. It drives out in the middle of nowhere, picks up a signal from the rocket launched (from Alpha-1 Rocket base or some other larger playset) with the very cool and unique radar array on top (or the one it's hauling), and transmits back to base via the computer in the back and the other radar dish it's hauling (or the one on top).  It's a very spartan, simple design and yet it offers hours of play value!

I just picked this up today and despite it being smaller than alot of other sets (like the Mobile Lab 6901 for instance) it is actually a much more enjoyable set in my opinion.  I wish I had had this when I was young.  It's very difficult for me to give the smaller sets 5 ratings because the small number of bricks doesn't allow for that much playability, but this one delivers. Brick for brick, one of the coolest functional little sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"meowq","2011-12-31T17:08:44.793Z","A good starter set","<p>This was first Space Lego set I got as a boy. I thought it was just awesome.&nbsp;This little set got me hooked on Space Lego. From this beginning I added on many more space Lego set until I had quite the collection.&nbsp; I remember liking how the truck pulled a trailer and how the minifig could sit at his computer panel in the back. </p><p>I remember how the radar tracking truck together with his partner from the Space Buggy (886) would travel across the Lunar landscape fending of their territories from the communist red cosmonaut minifigs. (hey, it was the cold war after all) -- Fun Stuff.</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4
