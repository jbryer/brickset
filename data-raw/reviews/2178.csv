It sold quite well, especially to young preschoolers. The downside is (to us) that they have Max and Tina figs which are Jack Stone sized, and therefore useless to most of us. But I like the rest of the little daily presents they made, especially the vehicles. The little ambulance is cute! There is also a mini version of the Com-Link Cruiser from the Space Port series. The space rocket from Space Port series also has a mini version here. Really cute!

The rest of the vehicles and presents are just normal items but some of them are well-designed for such a small build. Also, this flashes back the good old days of simple LEGO, as I might have said in other reviews as well.
