"legotrainfan","2007-11-25T13:58:54.09Z","A nice little set","This little excavator is a nice addition to your train layout. It's highly needed to build new tracks. I have to admit that it's a bit fragile. The upper yellow part is only connect with the lower red part by a 2x2 turntable. So the upper part sometimes falls off too quickly. But the turntable allows the upper part to go left and right. A movement of 360 degrees are no problem due to the turntable. 

This excavator also has a magnet. So you can move waggons. And it has wheels with suspension. Maybe a good addition to set 4543. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-06T10:30:51.713Z","LEGO Trains (9V) - Road and Rail Repair Review","This set is really good for a small set. It's an easy build and we also get a few stickers to put on. The main feature of this model is that the cockpit sviwels full 360Â°. The arm with the shovel lifts up and down. I also like the grill which LEGO did on the back of the cockpit. In the back you can also put in an extra magnet piece which comes with this set. Inside the cockpit are the controls and the place for the minifig to sit.<br><br>The coolest feature of this set is that you can decide if you want to maneuver this vehicle on tracks or on the ground. You just have to lift the train wheels on the front and on the back down. The bigger tyres have a nice spring mechanism which I haven't seen in today's LEGO sets. There're also two legs on each side which the driver can use if he wants to work on the tracks. I also like the minifig which we get here. The construction worker has a basic smiley face and he also has a white helmet and a cool looking overall. It's a nice set to have and it's worth the money for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

 oddly, the first Trains series set that I ever owned was not a train at
 all but this quaint little rail repair tractor. It was simple. It had 
train wheels. It whetted my appetite for more.<br>

 little set has a number of fun innovations that arose at the same time 
in other sets of a similar style. The 1991 Railroad Tractor Flatbed 
(4543) introduced the concept of the stabilizing rods, little hooks that
 could be brought down to stabilize the truck while working. That same 
year, the first truck with retractable railroad wheels, Road and Rail 
Maintenance (4546), released. It was not until the 1994 Road and Rail 
Repair, though, that the two concepts were unified in a single set. 
Adding onto that the rotating tractor top, this set remains a fairly 
unique entry in the LEGO Trains series.<br>

 many Trains sets, this one's uniqueness makes it fairly inspiring as 
well. But it is still small...too small. It's scoop is weak and its cab 
is unrealistically uncovered like so many LEGO vehicles.</span></div>

 Road and Rail Repair set got a bunch of things right, though. It sticks
 staunchly to the yellow theme of LEGO Trains maintenance crews but 
still manages to sneak in some red. The four drop-down wheels are not 
only nice for this set, but can be used in many other builds. The 
addition of a detachable magnet is extremely nice as it can be added to 
other LEGO Trains sets to be towed behind them. The rotating top can 
move 360 degrees, which is rare among LEGO vehicles.<br>

 set's main improvements focus on enclosing the cab and enlarging the 
scoop. LEGO always is light on their interiors but a maintenance shovel 
vehicle would always have a roof to protect itself. It would have 
increased the cost of this set by a bit but it really could have 
improved the design. Currently, the set is still fairly simple above the
 lazy susan. The shovel is small -- it should be double thickness -- and
 the arm that attaches it to the body is also weak. Later improvements 
by LEGO could have corrected this but, at the time, this was pretty much
 the best a small set like this could do for a scoop. One last 
improvement, print the LEGO Transit Authority logos on the slope bricks.
 Stickers sucked then just as they do today.<br>

 its appropriateness, the minifigure included in this set is simple at 
best. The set includes a generic blue minifigure with a red and white 
arrow-striped shirt that has a LEGO Transit Authority logo at the 
top-right corner. Otherwise, plain blue pants and arms, a smiley face 
head, and a white helmet make this minifigure nothing spectacular.</span></div>

 this set still deserves some respect. None has been made like it since 
it was first made in 1994 and it is still 100% compatible with today's 
LEGO Trains series. That kind of endurability is something to be proud 
of. There is little not to like about this set except its size and lack 
of details for the cab and shovel. Unless you don't like stickers of 
course. There are two of them...just to bother you. <br>
