"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-03T18:45:57Z","A Necessity for train sets","Having Manual Points in your railway opens up the basic round, oval or looped track allowing a multiplicity of track options, including shunting yards.

It is not perfect however, as you can't use it to turn a train around and send it back down the same length of track. You can connect the track to attempt this, but if you did it would cause a short circuit in the track.

A solution would be if TLC gave us train wheels with technic axle holes and an RC unit, then the tracks would not require the conductive surface (although they look better and more realistic with a metallic surface) and we could build bigger track layouts with cheaper track, power multiple locomotives using the technic 9V motor, and maybe even build a turntable.

Having said that, I also hope TLC continues to expand this track range and not make it redundant like the previous tracks.  I would like to see a bridge between this track and the old style track layout (as used in 4855-Spider Man's Train Rescue) that would allow nicely terminated track at buffer stops and the ability to shunt wagons onto roll-on roll-off ferries.  TLC could also produce the more obvious cross track at angles other than 90 degrees, as well as three-way and electric points.

My complements to TLC for the 9V track design; it is definitely an improvement on previous designs, especially as it looks better in dark grey, as well as having a higher count of sleepers per length, and not requiring a centre electrical rail.

Having the left and right handed points in the same set means that you can have symmetry in your layout, but this is not necessarily a good thing.

A minor problem with the Manual Points is that the curved track is designed to bring the train parallel to the original track, instead of giving an option to start a loop.

Overall I have to rate this product a 10, having taken into consideration the curved track 'fault' (and the fact that I don't like the colour of the switching lever), there isn't any alternative, as this accessory set significantly improves on an otherwise boring track.

You can build sidings and additional loops. But be careful! If you send rails back to the manual point where they have come from, there will be a short-circuit. However, you can cheat a bit. You can insert one of those new RC plastic rails. A 9V motor is just a bit shorter than one single rail. So if you send your 9V locomotive towards the RC rail at full speed, it should be able to pass it. It should also work - even more easily - when your locomotive has two motors. But I haven't tried those things yet. These are just some ideas how to build short-circuited layouts without actually having a short-circuit. 

When you want to have two parallel tracks coming from a manual point, note that there is always a lot of space between the parallel rails. So you need a lot of room for your layout. But there is also a good thing about this: when two parallel tracks come from a manual point, there is always enough space to put a platform between them. 

Unfortunately this set didn't also come with the old 12V electric rails in the middle of it. Then you would have been able to fully combine 12V and 9V trains. I don't have any 12V trains yet, but 9V/12V manual points would have been cool indeed! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
