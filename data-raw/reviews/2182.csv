"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T05:54:11Z","reaaly nice","now here we have a set that should not be missed on any train layout: a modern little level crossing with a lot of glass and in bold design. the bars consist of bricks (no parts like in 4539) and work fine. as an expanded version of the little tower have a look at the 10128 level crossing.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-20T12:14:54.39Z","Useful for your track layout","In my review of set 4539 I mentioned that level crossing was simply necessary if you had a track layout. The same is true for this one. In contrast to 4539 there is a tree in this set, but no flowers. It looks very bare. What it has in common with 4539 is that only few bricks were used. A car would make this set nicer too. The level crossing gates are made of round bricks. Consider it an improvement if you want. I don't care whether they are flat or round. I don't have level crossing 10128, but I'd like to have it; there's more stuff in it than in this one or its predecessor 4539. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"martin_ffm","2008-05-03T08:21:16.327Z","useful, but not well planned","I own this set and I'm glad about that, because track crossings are absolutely neccesary if you want to combine your train and city sets. But there are two things that really bother me about this set:
- if you close or open one of the bars, it hits the glass roof. It is no problem to avoid this, but I can't believe the guys from LEGO didn't notice this before the release
- the cabin could have been a bit more solid
Becaus of these two things I can only give it a 3, otherwise I like the set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-21T08:38:23.367Z","LEGO Trains (9V) - Manual Level Crossing Review","This set is a very useful set for any LEGO train collection. It's an easy build but it's still lot's of fun to build it. We also get a few stickers to worry about. For some reason you only get one minifig. I wish LEGO could have given this set 3 minifigs because there're 3 seats in total in this model. The office for the train conductor is very cool and the gates can be moved up and down very easily as well. It's a great set to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Ape_Fight","2009-12-31T13:32:23.75Z","Simple but good, plus can also be an Airport tower.","A good set if you have a circular layout and want to get into the middle. Yes, it is a bit bare but as with all my sets, it got covered in trees and flowers and signs pretty quick, so it's wasn't really a problem.

This looks a lot more modern that the 1991 version, and as I never knew why they have a tower on these things, and my airport was in the middle of the track, it handily doubled up as a control tower.

The problem with this set is it's sort of a station, but not quite, and the platform is too low for the passengers to get on the train (and waaaay to short of course), hence why mine became part of the airport instead.

Good, but flawed. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
