BUT the rotating wheel is a real hit and looks cool in front of a pushing diesel-engine. especially at higher speeds the wheel really turns fast, my kids just love it - very good playability.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

 Sometimes, a garage sale provides something you have wanted for a long time. For me, this was the Train Track Snow Remover. It is an extremely basic set, but from the moment I saw it, I wanted it. It was rare, and by the time I wanted it, it was out of production. Then a garage sale came around and I found 90% of the pieces in the bin. Bricklink provided the rest. Now all I&#39;m missing is the racing stickers along the sides that had been conveniently stripped off prior to my purchase.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Innovations: For such a simple set, there is one awesome little mechanic that makes it a star: the plow at the front actually spins when the car moves along the tracks. A fairly simple rubber-band based rig inside the car turns the plow when two rubber wheels roll along the tracks. It is simple but awesome and is really the only feature of the set.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Lack of Inspiration: The lack of other features is not surprising since the set accomplishes its one goal: to plow snow. But the the set could have come with a pile of white studs (snow) or something to suggest a snow plow is needed. The idea behind the set is fun, but it was definitely lacking something in the implementation category.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 What it Got Right: Yet the Train Track Snow Remover got its primary goal right and it accomplished it well enough. The plow itself looks rather odd but I could easily see it pushing through real snow. To add to that, the set comes with a coupling to attach to the front of a train, so the whole process can be automated. Granted, most of the passenger trains don&#39;t come with front couplings, but attach this little baby to a freight train and things are excellent if hauling in the great north. One extra little bonus is the chrome-plated smokestack that comes with the set. Perhaps it is poorly placed (I always turn it vertically so the hypothetical exhaust goes over the minifigure&#39;s head) but chrome is chrome and today it is rare. Add to that the normal two rail wheels and this set has a lot to offer.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Possible Improvements: At the time, I can really see few improvements LEGO would have made to the set. It was sold at a low price set&mdash;$9.99&mdash;so it is limited in piece count. The minifigure is generic at best and not entirely prepped for being in the snow, and the set is altogether boxy, but that was the style back in the late 1990s. This set fit in well enough with the other Train sets so I can&#39;t recommend much to improve.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 Minifigures: Back to the minifigure, there is really little going for it. It is a highly generic rail worker wearing sunglasses. According to Brickset, this exact figure appeared in two other sets, but variants of him showed up in many more. The dark gray pants are nice and I did always like the burgundy-on-blue Transportation vest, but it still is simple and, as noted above, does not suggest that the Train worker is working in the snow.</p>
<p>
 <br />
 How it Compares: Today, this set would probably never be produced, and no similar set has. It is simple, basic, lacks color, and provides a function that seems unneeded in the generally warm LEGO universe. That being said, the desire to have this set in the early 2000s is based on the fact that LEGO rarely went to the snow back then (remember Ice Planet 2002?) and this set was a strange exception. That makes it rare and unique, two things that are highly desirable to LEGO fans. While LEGO may not make another version anytime soon, it still compares well with the sets of its time and, with many modern modifications, could potentially be rereleased someday. Let&#39;s just hope for the sake of the minifigure that he gets a jacket or, better yet, a cabin to keep from getting frostbite while working on the railroad.</p>
