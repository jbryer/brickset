Theblue passenger coach has great details such as brown coach seats and even a stove. The engine comes with the traditional 9V motor that powers the train over a generous amount of track (bigger than most 9V train sets). The thing I was surprised about was the introduction into ""kid"" minifigs as it seems that three of the minifigs included in this set resemble a family going on vacation. Up until this set I never had seen a kid minifig before. It is a shame that the kid's legs don't operate like the typical minifigs. 

A few cons: this set could have had another train car such as the caboose (sold seperately) and the platform could've had more details such as a strret lamp or baggage carts.

All in all this set is amazing and it is even more so for me as this is the very first train set I have ever own and I have been collecting/playing with lego for over 20 years! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
