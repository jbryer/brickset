I think this is (along with the 12v petrol wagon (shell)) one of my favourites, I've made 5, the more the better!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jd5775","2007-08-17T00:02:04.707Z","Great addition to any train","I personally love this set, and so should any train fan.  It goes really well when bunched with others, but also when next to the red hopper car from 4564.  The only problem is that the red hopper car is one stud shorter than the blue, but it really doesn't matter.  I also tried to put a layer of white smooth plates on top of the red, to give them equal height but it just didn't work.  Maybe red plates would work...  Anyway this set comes with a loading dock (really an unloading dock) that fits perfectly on to one piece of track and catches the 1x1 cylinder bricks very well.  Good set to buy a lot of but only if you were buying it at $16.50 (Price in my catalog).  Now they are between $50 and $75 dollars.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5

I think blue is a nice colour for such a waggon but what I really find cool is that door at the waggon's bottom. There is a mechanism that allows you to unload the freight. The freight itself is also included in this set: round 1x1 bricks. 

I think this set is a great addition to 4563 or crocodile engine 4551. Maybe you'll also like it as an addition to Hopper Waggon 10017. Both 4536 and 10017 serve the same purpose. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
