You get a unique train car that expands your octan influence and a truck to carry little fuel drums to the local gas stations.  This set contains the rather elusive black decorated 2x2 slopes and 3x3 facets.  I am proud to say that the 'octan' logo on the fuel drums is printed rather than stickered. :) But the facets contain stickers.  This along with Gas Transit were my first octan sets (I think) and I got these in 94' when I was like 3 or 4.  Those were the golden ages of lego 9v, and lego town.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

But on the waggon there are still stickers. On the two white panels, which are on the truck's roof, there is also a sticker. 

I find the waggon looks brilliant. It is definitely a nice addition to the Octan petrol stations and/or the Octan truck 6594. The truck in this set can be used for other containers too. And the plate with the barrels on it can be put on other waggons as well. It's compatible with the waggon in set 4555, for instance. 

You also get a minifig, the truckdriver, and the waggon has a hose with which you can fill the barrels with petrol. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
