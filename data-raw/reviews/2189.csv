It does not have many pieces. There are two flowers, two road signs and a minifig, but the whole thing could have been made nicer. A tree and a car would have been good in this set. And the gates cannot be lowered by remote control. There isn't a remote controlled level crossing for 9V trains, which is a pity. But still: what's a track layout without a level crossing?
