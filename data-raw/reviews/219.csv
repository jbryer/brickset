"Novelty","2007-11-28T01:31:20.11Z","Bishonen","At first glance, this is just a boring white ninja with a cart.  There's nothing special about the white ninja or the cart.  The cart is equipped with a flag, two axes and two wheels.  The front of the cart includes two clips for attaching the swords to the cart.  Nothing special really... until the mask of the ninja is removed.  It is then revealed that the ninja is actually a female.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-25T13:53:56.28Z","The white ninja","This is a ninja small set, good for one, have useful pieces and cool designs, like the ninja accessories in the white color. Have weapons, a help to army maker, and more useful than some new small impulse sets like the good wizard. The cart is cool, and some carts were from the castle themes like the fright knights, dragon knights, and also the classic. Two axes and also two black katanas are included, in one good and hard to find color. The minifigure don't have new details, but if it is a female minifigure, what is the problem ? Have many male minifigures, and few female, one or two aren't a problem... It includes more pieces for a lego scenery and buildings, like the flag.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"azoxystrobin","2008-07-15T18:29:45.42Z","limited impulse packs from '99 ?","I must concur; There is nothing special about this set.
It's just an impulse set; a minifig with a few bits of lego for a minimal build.

the only good thing is that its quite cool to have the white ninja princess in ones collection.
that and 4 minifig weapons, 2 of which are black katanas.

Maybe TLC should edit them again to cull some of the spculation going on...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
