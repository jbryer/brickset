"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-30T10:30:09.62Z","LEGO Trains (9V) - Rail and Road Service Truck","This set is a great addition to your LEGO trains collection. It comes with some useful tools and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. This set also comes with a traffic light for the trains. You'll see a lever piece which you can sviwel if you want to see a green or a red light. The truck looks also very cool. For some reason LEGO put a plate in the inside of the cockpit which doesn't have any pegs on it. Due to this the minifig will be a little bit loose in there.<br><br>The ceiling lifts up and on the front is a nice grill piece with a red megaphone piece on each side which you can use as a signal-horn if you want. On the back is a magnet which allows you to attach this truck to your trains. This vehicle also has a platform which you can lift up which makes it easier for the minifig to work on the traffic light. To make it easy for the driver of this truck to drive on the track you can lift down some special wheels. This makes is possible to drive on the tracks or on the road. I also can't complain about the minifigs we get. It's a fun set to play with and it's worth the money for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
