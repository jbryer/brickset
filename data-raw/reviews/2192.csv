"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T05:37:02Z","another great set","this flatbed waggon with a tractor is just as superb as the other sets from this 9v-era, tremendously detailled, consisting of many many bricks and a pleasure for the eye. the only disadvantage is the lenghth of the waggon - compared to other waggons it just seems too long, and also the red hatches are a little waggly. so it is rather a model than a toy, but hey, nothing against that!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"lostcarpark","2007-04-07T06:44:27.177Z","Nice set!","A simple idea, but lots of playability. While I'm fond of the newer 6-wide vehicle designs, this set really shows how much detail you could fit in a 4-wide body. Keeping all the hinge panels on the flatbed aligned can be a real pain, though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-11-30T09:12:40.357Z","Simple waggon, detailed tractor","The waggon is quite simple in design. It is not too long. It is long enough for the tractor and its trailor. If it were shorter, it would be hard to put them on it. But yes, it is really hard to keep the hinge train gates in line. But without them, the waggon would not look so good. 

The tractor is very detailed. You can move the front shovel upwards and downwards, but the rear shovel has got more moving functions. You can also move it left and right due to a turntable plate with hinge. And the front wheel with suspension is also great. Under the yellow, small tipper bucket (top part of the trailer) are hinges. When you put some small bricks in it, you can discharge it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
