You can also add it to a passenger train, because some passengers might want to take their cars with them when travelling by train. But don't add it to 10001/4558, which is a complete unit of its own with its black front and and back window sections for the engine driver to look out. If you add this car to it, it'll look ugly and strange, but maybe it's nice to add it to one of your own passenger train creations. 

The mechanism of the loading platform works well, though you must first get used to it. Four train signal masts, which can often be found in 12V sets, were used for the ramp of the loading station. An ingenious idea!

The car looks great and the colours that were chosen for this set are also alright. Yellow and black look excellent for the waggon and old gray, red, and yellow are also quite good for the loading station itself.

A better way of keeping the car in its place on the waggon could be thought of. The car moves a bit when the waggon is under way. However, I've never lost the car on the waggon when a locomotive pulled or pushed it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

You get a car transport wagon, car, bridge to put the car on, and a minifig. I really like the car because I like 4 wide cars. This is a must have for train fans alike.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
