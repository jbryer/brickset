One of the earliest however is '4546' - a Road and Rail Maintenance vehicle that sports small model which can be run on either 9v track or, thanks to its wheels, on the road.</p><p>(P)</p><p>Obviously, the main plus for this model just like most of the 90's sets is that it has a lot of attention to detail and uses next to no 'special' parts that would otherwise saturate most modern Lego products. The most surpassing addition is the set of suspension-axles for the road wheels, which I've rarely seen. They feature two tiny springs for each hinge, meaning the vehicle can be tilted left and right. Very smooth! All the usual elements are here though - headlights, two side exhausts/cannisters, an antenna and a patrol light.</p><p>(P)</p><p>Another nice addition is that train coupling, which although on the box art is placed at the back, can also be placed at the front. Since it only has a peg fitting, it can be unclipped and pushed into the front hole too, yet the joint is strong because its fixed between 3 layers of flat-studded parts. This means your vehicle can be 'towed' by a train from either the front of the back, or of course you can manually push/pull it. The joints that move the train wheels up and down are not loose and are very inventive in design.</p><p>(P)</p><p>Driving the vehicle, or at least accompanying it, is a classic 90's train driver with his striped vest and blue/red/white attire (as well as a 'neutral' smile - not a cheesy high eyebrow and massive grin). He also has a broom and shovel to use - both of which can clip to the very back of the vehicle, while the garbage can sits nicely in the back. There is also room for another 2x2 besides the can in the back, too, so you can add your own accessory as well. A nice design and might look really good with another garbage can -you could always alternate the grey one included with another colour to suggest a different type of storage/waste?</p><p>(P)</p><p>My only gripe is that it doesn't feel as robust as many other Train accessories, and this is most likely because this model in particular is quite small. It is only 4 studs wide, leaving the train wheels as the 5th and 6th studs, but just like a lot of the older sets, its mainly the doors that can be a little annoying since there is no 'fixture' above them that holds them firmly in place, so you have to be careful when opening and closing. Building time was roughly 5 minutes, though could be more if you're hopeless applying stickers like me! (white and black stickers are included for your choice)</p><p>(P)</p><p>Other than this, the set itself is a great addition to your railway and possibly a very unusual one too. It's a pity Lego don't make sets like this anymore, but I think the task of tracking them down and building them is always very rewarding. Given its small size, don't pay anymore than Â£15 second hand.</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
