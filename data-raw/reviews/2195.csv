At Christmas I always had to decide whether I should wish one large set (e.g. 4558) or several smaller ones. I normally wished smaller ones. So a long time passed and finally I could add 10001 to my train collection. Before I added metroliner 10001 this set was my only passenger waggon.

This waggon is fantastic! It has two levels. On the lower level you find two sleeping compartments, each with a wash basin and tap. On the upper level you find red chairs and tables put on blue plates. You can remove the plates with the chairs, which gives you better access to the sleeping compartments. You get five passengers for this waggon: three men and two women. 

Buy it when you have 4558 or 10001! It's really a great addition! But your metroliner won't be so fast with it. So my metroliner has two motors to be as quick as it should be. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It perfectly fits to the rest and its not to high. I like the option to open the transparent roof in butterfly style to access easy the inside. the interior is just fabulous 5 seats, 4 face to face with a small round table inbetween. after lifting the  upper floor in the down section you'll find to bed chambers both with a washing opportunity, all very nice details. 5 minifigs is superb as even you put to for bed time the wagon still doesnt look empty caus 3 guys are left on the top floor. I cutomized it together with the full train iluminating it all over from inside. the normal twinlights like used for police cars are perfect on this one. 2 of this on both sides between up and down section will light up both floors, looks absolutly great while driving in darkness.
everybody who has 4558 should not miss to get also this one, but it looks even good on other engines (like 4563 or 4564) as a regional express.

no cons. anybody should tell me what to make better on this one!

It is a great wagon for all passengertrains. Great&nbsp;details and will take&nbsp;any passenger&nbsp;train up a level - I promise! :-)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,5
