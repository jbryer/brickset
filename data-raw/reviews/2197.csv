What a wonderful set

Pros:
-Containers are amazing
-Great truck! One of the greatest System trucks if not the greatest.
-Train car is excellent and is a great addition to any train
-Lift vehicle is designed well and is an overall good addon to any set
-Great combination of vehicles for the price of $52 when I bought it

Cons:
-Expensive (today on ebay)

I wish I bought more!

Great set if you see it on ebay misb, it's really worth it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

If more bricks had been added, there would probably be not enough room for the containers. The containers are nice and have doors at both ends. You get two big and two small containers. There's nothing in the containers. So you must add some freight yourselves. 

The truck and the crane are very detailed and look great. And this set has a lot of playability since it gives you all you need to transport containers: crane, truck, waggon. You also get two minifigs who are in charge for the loading and unloading procedure. 

I think it's a perfect addition to 4555. The Freight Loading Station (4555) can load the waggon and the crane in 4549 can unload the containers in another part of your LEGO city. The waggons in both sets are fully compatible with the containers of the other set. Also the crane mechanism of 4555 and 4549 is identical.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It worked perfectly with the intermodel design with the train sets and other Town lego sets. The crane was lots of fun to operate, although the thing was a bit sticky when you tried to unlatch the grips off the container. 
This item is on my top 5 favorite sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
