There is only one small flaw, the crane cannot pick up the speeder car because the boom is too short and if you turn the supply car around you can't pick up the welder's hut. Other than that, it's the best! Mine's stil intact after almost 10 years of service (lol).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-31T08:34:37Z","precious!","this one is a good example for legos glory in the past. there are endless ways to use these two waggons, in a goos colour scheme. only the crane waggon is a little higher than usual cars - watch your bridges!
it should be rereleased as a legend immediately.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-12-06T06:38:33.343Z","Perfect crane","Yes, I agree that the crane cannot pick up the little supply waggon. And when you turn the smaller train waggon around it can't pick up the green hut. But that's really the only thing that can be criticised. The crane itself is brilliant. Due to a turntable it can move left and right. It can go round in a complete circle; or 100 circles and more if you want. And when it lifts something heavy, its stability is guaranteed by four supports (two on each side). 

You get two green train doors. They are very rare. Apart from this set, they can only be found in set 7898. What I also find excellent is the detailed imitation of a welding apparatus. You get a welder and a crane operator. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-28T08:51:47.603Z","LEGO Trains (9V) - Cargo Crane Review","This set is a nice addition to any LEGO train collection. It has some cool stuff like a little shed, a cart, a palette with weight, a wagon and the crane. The set is a great build and we also get a few stickers to worry about. The wagon can be attached to the wagon with the crane very easily and there's also space for the cart and the shed. The crane sviwels full 360Â° and the cockpit can be opened very easily. The bar of the crane can be moved up and down as well. It's a great set to have and to play with. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
