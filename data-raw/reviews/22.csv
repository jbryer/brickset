Making such a huge ship with so much details is just fabulous, and no-one EVER thought we would going to have this in the LEGO Star Wars line-up.  It's not the king of the LEGO Star Wars Sets, but certainly amongst the greatest.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-02-27T00:00:00Z","","A great set and a joy to build, but it's let down on 2 points: The spacecraft is very flimsy when built, just picking it up will cause the engines to sag / fall off and the internal structure just forward of the engines could do with more bricks for reinforcement. Finally the kit comes with stickers rather than printed parts, some of these stickers cover 2 or 3 bricks so it's best not to use them if you want to take the model apart in the future.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-02T00:00:00Z","","This thing is BIG and HEAVY. Other that the ISD, I can't think of any other sets larger (other than the pure sculptures). However, one drawback is the use of stickers, especially stickers that cover multiple bricks.

"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-12T04:58:12Z","Recommended if you have the room","This set is huge, over 1,700 pcs (and the price reflects that), over 2 feet long and almost 1 foot wide!  The details are great and is a good representation of the ship. Some have commented that it is flimsy and falls apart. However UCS's are basically sculptures and are not made to &swoosh;!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T17:12:49Z","Big &amp; Detailed","Awesome.  Second only to the Star Destroyer (10030) in terms of coolness (to date), in my humble opinion.  As frustrating as some of the fiddly detail pieces can be, they really add to the look of the ship when it's put together.

The only disappointment (if you can call it that) is that the weight of the engines means they tend to sag a bit when the model is on the stands.  Also, finishing off the build with 11 engines is a little bit of an anticlimax.

It's not meant for playing with, but two pieces on the sides tend to fall off at the slightest touch, but in terms of construction it's pretty solid otherwise.

Highly recommended, but harder and harder to find these days.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-03T21:41:46Z","Almost Perfect","The set is one of the best UCS's ever.  I got it for Christmas and it took me 7 hours to build.  This set is so big! The engines are gigantic and it makes almost every other Lego set ( excluding ISD) cower from its size.  This is most likely the biggest set I'll ever get.  Anyway, I gave it a 9 because it is so flimsy.  If you tap either one of the star trek ship things ( at least they look like it), in the middle of the engines, the fall off.  When You try to put those back on, other pieces fall off.  Therefore, this set is definitely something to admire and look at, and not to play with or touch. ( If you can lift it up , that is)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-12T22:47:39Z","Great set!","Like the other reviewers, I hate the stickers. I wish we had the preprinted pieces instead. I am not great with stickers and you have to be very patient to get them on straight. I HAVE no patience, just like Luke. 

took me about 6 hours to build. 4 of them looking for pieces and 2 actually building. I do advise you to separate the pieces as logically you can before you start. You may be able to build it in 2.5 to 3 hours if you do it that way. 

No playability whatever as the engines are too heavy and fall too easily. still, a great looking set. its the prize of my collection until I get the star destroyer. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-30T18:44:13Z","this set is sooooo awsome!!!!!!","I love this set its sooooo cool! 
 
       Plus's- the set is very very detailed
             - the set is pretty strong (except the back)
             - its huge (probably the second biggest star wars set)

       minuses - the back is to weak
               - the guns come off to easily

"sudorum","2008-02-14T17:12:18.31Z","accuracy redefined","The front cap of the rebel blockade runner is greatly constructed, and very detailed for a meer 2001 model. The mid section, front, and back turbo engines separate using pegged pieces, and are built individually. Worth $300 though it only has about 1,500 pieces. You must have this model if you want a full and lush ucs collection. The back section takes forever to build, but in the end, the sight is eye-sating. only one setback: decals galore.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"sidneyleejohnson","2008-12-13T20:11:20.997Z","From 5 to 1 after 7 years of shelf life","<p>Yes I loved this set when I first built it. Held it in my hands no problem. Sat it on the Piano for several years then packed it away. Recently unpacked it and the rear section no longer holds up. I can&#39;t lift it without it falling apart. I can&#39;t set it down without the left and right engine holders in the back falling off. I will probably have to reorder some of the lego pieces to replace the lego&#39;s in the rear section. Somehow the tension on some of the pieces must have lost just enough for it to all come crumbling apart in my hands while i try to move it around. Front and mid sections hold up fine. Of course I&#39;m not using glue to hold the pieces together. Not sure that should be a requirement....I&#39;m sure glue would solve the problem I just don&#39;t like resorting to that trick.</p>

"mustakotka","2014-02-18T18:31:21.483Z","Best UCS I've owned","<p>I was too young when this came out to actually want one - which might be good since I wouldn&#39;t have probably appreciated all its beauty back then. It&#39;s a magnificent set well worth the money (I paid 400 euros&nbsp;in Feb 2013 for a used set).</p>

<h3>Scale</h3>

<p>There&#39;s been a lot of controversy over the scale of this model. The cockpit and the engines are way too large and the engines are positioned too close to each other; according to movies there should be a gap between each adjacent engine. It bothers some people.</p>

<p>Also I would like to point out that this set is approximately in same scale with 7778 (Midi-size Millenium Falcon) and various mini-size sets of X-wings, TIE fighters and whatnot. I have this on the shelf with 30051 X-wings and 8028 TIE Fighters and a 7778 Millenium Falcon.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>The single most beautiful thing about the design is the cockpit. It&#39;s radially built, but sideways and sticks together with technic pins. The engines are beautiful, too, among many other details. There&#39;s lots of sideways building which is a good thing in my opinion. Also the whole thing is modular which makes handling it a bit easier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a few design flaws; the engines sit on two 2x2 plates and if you move the set around the connections might get loose and engines may fall off. Also the whole ship is very heavy so adding one more support to the middle in long term might not be a bad idea, just to prevent stress and drooping.</p>

<p>The stickers. Mine have stayed ok and the guy who put them on wasn&#39;t a &quot;blind thumbless monkey&quot; like someone described the usual decal planting style. Would have preferred prints...</p>

<h3>The build and complete ship</h3>

<p>Building this ship takes a few hours. Everything else is interesting and non-repetitive except the engines that there are 11 of them and they are all quite large and bulky. From a modder&#39;s point of view the engines are also annoying because they are based around a cross axle (good choice for vertical structures, but...) which is difficult to work with. I&#39;ve been meaning to put some LEDs on that but it&#39;s taking forever to find an alternative to the cross axle at times.</p>

<p>I can see why the overall score for this beauty would drop: it&#39;s the playability. There isn&#39;t, really. I&#39;m a mid-sized man and I can barely swoosh this thing. But playing with this one is more in the construction process and appreciating the design. It&#39;s not a toy, it&#39;s a model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Even though I said harsh things about stickers and engines I have to say it&#39;s really impressive. I usually change small details to my liking but with this one I&#39;ve changed nothing. Only internal supports to accommodate the LEDs but nothing on the outside. I certainly don&#39;t regret buying this piece and would regret selling it. I feel like many of the scale issues were in exchange for a more interesting build, which is ok to me as both Star Wars and Lego enthusiast.</p>

<p>I can only recommend...</p>

<p>To me my one of most underestimated UCS but I was pretty wrong.</p>

<p>Looks gorgeous,great look,great size,Awesome building experience,great LOOKING parts(especially special and valuable parts),only I wasn&#39;t sure whether apply the stickers due to bad references about quality and high value unless couldn&#39;t be satisfy to keep it displayed without.</p>

<p>Maybe one issue...to a relative big weight ,supports and stands to this set looks pretty weak although hold in cabinet without shaking.</p>

<p>Thanks TLC made me proud to keep this beauty.</p>
