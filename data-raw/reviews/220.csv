"Gus_263","2008-04-04T17:54:30.7Z","Jungle Surprise","This is an useful small set of the adventurers theme, previously in the desert, this in the jungle subtheme. It have a good color scheme, with red, yellow and blue parts, with good quality in painting. Green parts like the plants are included to looks like jungle. Another itens to make a lego scenery are the spider and of course the shapes of the plants and of the minifigure. Things like the map, the minifigure's bag and hat makes this set likes with the other adventurers. The minifigure is a female one. Good to make cities because only male figures can't make one. The itens makes this minifigure an adventurer, and the complete set too. A red snake is also included and is well made to sets like this. The playability is basically play with the spider, snake and the minifigure in this building, but with more others is easy make creations or transforms it in a bigger set. The size is small, but the pieces are useful, to sets with these colors or not.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

There are alot of supplies in this set like guns, treasures, and a small temple. The Gail Storm minifigure is also a great part of this set too. Overall, this set is pretty good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-01T11:04:56.92Z","Dangerous Situation in a Jungle","Pippin Reed is back in another small set dedicated to her. She is afronted with an altar with a strange color scheme and two deadly animals. (Spider, Snake) There are lots of leaf pieces to bring on the jungle ambience. Pippin Reed carries a rucksack, treasure map and a rifle as well as a white explorer hat. The altar top swivels to reveal a treasure inside which is a golden plate with a monkey face on it. (Or at least I think its a monkey). One of the more complete Adventurers impulse sets.

Figures
Gail storm- It's a good figure but I never really liked it. 4/5

Accesories
A map, jewel, backpack, and a rifle in a $3 set? Awesome! 5/5  

Build
At age 5 at found the build to be short yet rather difficult great for an impulse set 4/5

Playability
This is one of the few $5 and under sets that stands on it own as far as this goes, with a snake and a spider to ""fight"" and fact that the shine opens make this way above aver age 5/5

Overall
A great set not worth more then $5 ($10 if your a huge fan) but I can't complain

"Cake_Crafted","2016-05-12T13:38:41.323Z","Great set for the size","<p><em>I don&#39;t actually&nbsp;own this set, however I was&nbsp;able to almost completely&nbsp;build it thanks to the handy website that is rebrickable.com. </em></p>

<p>Getting on to the review, you get one minifigure, Pippin Reed also known as Gail Storm or whatever you want to call her. She has a nice&nbsp;map piece&nbsp;along with a rifle and backpack which can be opened up, although this makes it quite big and hard to stand the figure up when not on studs.</p>

<p>Moving on the model itself, it is very small so not much to cover. You can open the whole thing up to reveal the treasure hidden inside, a shiny gold plate which looks pretty cool. There is also a small gem attached beneath the leaf and a area where the snake can hide in.</p>

<p>So to conclude this is a pretty nice set for the size, definitely my favorite of the small sets from the Jungle subtheme. The only complaint I have is on the back it would be nice to have something to fill the small gaps under the lid, but that&#39;s all.</p>

<p>A nice set, but I have seen this go for quite a lot of money on eBay so don&#39;t pay too much for it</p>

<p><strong>Rating 4/5&nbsp;</strong></p>

"Gameaucracy","2015-03-23T04:14:10.657Z","Jungle Surprise, Kiss the Snake You Fool","<p>Alright, what&#39;s next on the list? Ah, Jungle Surprise, a classic...ish. Lot&#39;s of nice little pieces and my first female minifig! I&#39;m moving up in the world. I think at this point in my life I was young enough to go &quot;Mortgage payments,&nbsp;what&#39;s that? Sounds terrible.&quot;</p>

<p>So here we have a nice little adventurer that goes by the name of...name of...*google search* Gail Storm? Really? Ok then. Nice little adventurer by the name of Gail Storm. Ah yes, knew that name like the back of my hand. On the box you see her holding some treasure, which from the looks of it seems to be one of those fancy gold iPads that people get when they have more money than sense. And in the other hand she has her trusty rifle, because she is a strong independent woman that doesn&#39;t need no man&#39;s protection;&nbsp;I&#39;m assuming from people trying to steal her iPad. Also on the box you see her looking at the snake, who&#39;s going in for the kiss. The snake&#39;s going &quot;I&#39;ve only had two drinks I&#39;m fine&quot; while Ms. Storm is going &quot;I just want to be friends&quot; all over that sucker.</p>

<p>There are some other nice pieces on this set too. A spider is provided that doubles as something you can put on your mother&#39;s pillow to scare her to...I mean I wouldn&#39;t know what else you could use it for. There&#39;s also a map and a diamond, as well as some foliage to add to some other stuff you got going on.</p>

<p>Overall a nice little addition to go along with other adventure sets you got. Or if you just want some treasure and animals, I guess that&#39;s fine too...</p>

<p><strong>Score:&nbsp;One slip of the tongue out of a last night&#39;s regret. Yeah that sounds about right.</strong></p>
