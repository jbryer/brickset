certainly a train wash for your lego trains sounds like a brilliant idea, but the way it is presented here just fills your eyes with tears, and not with those of joy: brushes mounted on small cars? two sober monorail supports, cronwned by a huge juniorized slope? why on earth didn't they at least attach a 3rd horizontal brush to it? and worst of all, a wagon with a purpose completely unintelligible?
leaving aside all these questions, there are actually 2 good things to mention: the construction works well, i.e. if your train (6-wide) goes through it, the brushes rotate and remove occasional dust. second, there is an acceptable buffer stop included. 
sad enough, that's about all, because not even the parts selection satisfies. so should you ever come close to this set, just keep a safe distance.

"asianlego","2008-10-01T11:24:10.86Z","More like Brain Wash.","I hope TLG would make more correct sets that are comparable to their real life counterparts. I used to want this set so badly when I was small and I sorta regret it right now because this set is absolute trash. First of all, the train wash itself. Why are there two little cart buggies holding a brush each? And also, why are there no water facilities nearby when water is a prime element while washing? Luckily they added a buffer and an extra straight rail or I bet no one buys this.

Value for money : - No1 this is excellent, 2 minifigs, lots of tools, a train carriage, lots of cool bits and pieces.

Playability : It does work, i have tried it with everything from 7740, 4558, and the recent battery sets and they all work just great...ok we knoe that real train cleaners dont have two carts etc and tend to be in a big shed... but if you want realism, you would have to pay for it! But its a really neat clever little functioning set, that works, that you can play with and you can build lots of other sets with.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>This set is part of my AFOL purchase. I have bought 10 different sets mostly trains in one lot, and this was one of the most waited set. And now I am in trouble to rate the set. Maybe the high expectations?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building experience:</strong></p>

<p>I&nbsp;really enjoyed the building, how the small pieces getting into the whole station, and the instruction was very useful. In the end was a little bit strange for me, how the brushes have to attach.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Lot&nbsp;of pieces with&nbsp;big variation. Nice train worker figures with different faces. The main colors are blue &amp; white are fits to this set, and gives the feeling of a washing station.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>This is the hard part of the review. Nice, good parts, two&nbsp;minifigure, moving parts, tools, railway wagon, fits to the railway, but the washing works different as I expected... Somehow I have the feeling this is not the set what I have been waiting. :( But on the other hand that is true, I am happy I can own this set! :)</p>

<p><b>Value of the money:</b></p>

<p>I think worth the money what I have been payed for a used set. You can still&nbsp;buy some used&nbsp;sets and also available&nbsp;sealed versions which I think a bit expensive.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Against the rating of 3, if you like trains it is crystal clear you have to own this set.</p>

"sparticusjoe","2019-03-12T17:58:15.817Z","Maximum fun, zero realism.","<p>Okay, let&#39;s get this out of the way first: This set does not even remotely resemble an actual train wash. One might even be able to say this set doesn&#39;t even remotely resemble much of *anything* in the real world and, well, I can&#39;t argue with that. Trains are actually washed inside of big sheds that sort of look like massive car washes. You almost undoubtedly wouldn&#39;t wash a shallow-walled flatbed like this. The two vehicle things on either side of the tracks have absolutely no prototype in the real world and this entire set is pure fantasy (much like, interestingly enough, most of the late 90&#39;s 9v train sets... 4559 and 4561 don&#39;t really have any actual basis in the real world either).</p>

<p>That all being said... A kid won&#39;t care, as kid-me certainly didn&#39;t care. I&#39;m reasonably certain the designer of this set wasn&#39;t intending on making a realistic depiction of how a real world locomotive was washed any more than they intended 4559 to be an actual depiction of a passenger and cargo diesel train. What I believe the designer was going for was something that&#39;d be super fun and offer tons of playability to a young train obsessed kid and that&#39;s exactly what this set is.</p>

<p>As always, I&#39;ll review each component piece by piece.</p>

<p><strong>The Wash Carts:</strong> I have no idea what else to call these. So as said before, these things have exactly zero bearing on reality. They&#39;re on a pair of tiny flanged train wheels, though they oddly don&#39;t actually run on a train track. The wheels enable them to go backwards to accommodate (almost) any 9v train to go through the wash, and gravity makes them slide down. This is actually a pretty clever solution to solving the fact that some 9v trains are a stud wider than others, and it works all things considered pretty well. The two 9v trains I have, 4559 and 4561, both fit with no problems through here, as do their cars and the supplied flatbed train car. I&#39;ve heard numerous times a ton of the other trains that I don&#39;t have don&#39;t fit through this whatsoever which I could easily believe, if your train has any part of it that sticks out more than around and and a half studs on either side, it probably won&#39;t fit. Of note, the snowblower set 4533 does NOT fit through here.</p>

<p>There are two carts, they&#39;re impressively modular (the washing bristles come off easily, as does the &quot;water tank&quot; things), and if you take the washing bristles and the tanks off they fit a single mini figure at the controls, allowing you to do other things with them, as the set is intended. This is a super cool play feature that again, is about as unrealistic as it gets. You can mount the really weird included snowplow blade and... uh... robot arm thing? I have no idea what the other one is supposed to be, but still, you can mount them on the front of the tiny carts to have two little unpowered maintenance vehicles for your railway. It&#39;s a cool feature, one you probably won&#39;t use much but it&#39;s a nice thought anyway. Though again, I have NO CLUE what the second of the two attachable peripherals is supposed to be. It&#39;s a two-points-of-articulation bendy arm thing with a wrench and a screwdriver mounted to the front. No idea what it&#39;s for.</p>

<p>Probably also of note, the carts&#39; controls consist of just a steering wheel, which is odd, to say the least, for a railroad vehicle with no need for steering. That said if you&#39;re a dumb little kid you probably won&#39;t think much of it as I didn&#39;t as a lad, but as a crabby old adult writing overlong reviews of ancient toys on the internet you&#39;ll look at it and let out a resounding &quot;huh&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>The Washing Station Itself:</strong> The actual station the train wash is based on is IMPRESSIVELY minimalist. Once you take the wash carts, buffers, and flatbed train cart off of it, you&#39;re left with virtually nothing, which is one of the strangest parts of the set. You&#39;d have a set that&#39;s physically one third of the size but would have almost exactly the same contents if you just took the base out entirely.</p>

<p>The washing station consists of two identical platforms to mount the wash carts on, a single piece of 9v straight track running through it, a pair of tool racks, an archway that says &quot;AQUA&quot; on it for some reason, and that is literally it. There is not much to this thing, weirdly enough. It serves its purpose of housing the carts just fine, but you can&#39;t help but think at least a control panel or a hose or two would have been appropriate. As-is this thing just looks incredibly barren. Having anything hanging from the archway like a light, a hose, a third top bristle brush, or anything would have given the base some reason to exist. I put a tree on some of the blank space on the back of the set as a kid just to give it something to look at.</p>

<p>Of note, there are two mini figures that come with this set, and both are as generic as it gets for 9v 90&#39;s town sets. In fact, you probably already have these two guys already, one came with the 4533 snowblower and the other came with the freight weighing station. Hard to get too excited about these guys. It&#39;s sunglasses guy and mustache man, who seemed to do every job in the 90&#39;s Lego universe.</p>

<p><strong>The Buffers: </strong>Honestly, getting it now as an adult, the best part of this set. To the best of my knowledge this is the only officially made by Lego pair of buffers from the time period. I think there was another buffer set that came with a later world city set but from the late 90&#39;s I believe this was it. It&#39;s... pretty good actually. Easily the most realistic part of the set. They do their jobs fine, they look the part, the red light bricks on them are pretty nifty and give it a &quot;heavy industry&quot; look to them, and if you run a train into them at full speed the buffers don&#39;t break and do in fact stop the train. The only downside is that you need an odd number of switch tracks to really take advantage of this which was difficult at the time due to switches being sold in pairs. Nowadays with the advent of bricklink it&#39;s much easier to add a little turnoff siding track from your main line.</p>

<p><strong>The Flatbed Car: </strong>I have no idea why Lego went with a flatbed to have as a play feature on a train wash set, which logically would be more appropriate to a boxcar... or passenger car... or engine... or literally anything else that water wouldn&#39;t just pool up and leak out of if you drenched it with water to wash it, but that&#39;s what they did. That said, for what it is, this little thing&#39;s kind of cute. There really isn&#39;t much to it, it&#39;s a flatbed car with one-brick-high sidings, with some fences on either end so you can have a railway worker standing in it in motion. There are bricks and tiles placed inside the flatbed exactly so that you can fit in the pair of accessory peripherals for the water carts, the bulldozer blade and the robot arm thing, and store them in this flatbed when they&#39;re not in use (which is usually, if you&#39;re anything like me), and there&#39;s also room to mount the water tanks from the water carts in the flatbed when you do use the peripherals, which is a nice touch. I think this little flatbed car looks particularly good being pulled by the 4533 snow plow to make a little railway maintenance train.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: </strong>Average, mostly due to some really interesting little tricks used in constructing the water carts (particularly the way that the designer came up with to keep the bristle brushes unable to move side to side... that&#39;s really cool, you&#39;ll know what I mean if you read the manual). It&#39;s a pretty easy build all things considered, and the parts count isn&#39;t great or anything, but as far as late 90&#39;s quick-n-dirty-kinda-town-jr. sets go, the building experience is fine. Of note though, well over half the part count of this set is spent building the same things twice. The two water carts&#39; builds are identical.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Tons of cool parts, which is probably the best part of the overall set. This set would make a great starter set to building an actual, real train wash that wasn&#39;t just an archway with some tools scattered around it. If you don&#39;t care about the set keeping its resale value, which is considerable these days with it long, long out of print, there are tons of cool things you could do with this bad boy to make it into a much better set with the parts included. Adding control panels to the base plate, putting another brush on top of the archway, putting hoses around, adding some handcarts and the like, will all go a long way to making a much more realistic looking train wash.</p>

<p>You get two pieces of straight 9v track (always nice to have), three sets of buffers, a pair of big train wheels, the very rare bristle brushes that cat hair loves to get caught in, a total of 8 (!) tiny flanged train wheels that are barely in any sets, and a lot of blue transparent bricks that aren&#39;t exactly easy to find as well.</p>

<p>There are, however, a few stickers with the set as is the custom for late 90&#39;s train sets for some reason. Town Jr. barely had any stickers but the more expensive, &quot;deluxe&quot; train sets almost always had them which I always found odd. Believe it or not, yep, after two decades the stickers have aged terribly and are peeling on my set and the printed town jr. bricks from my other sets still look like the day they were made, part of why I have such a distaste for stickers. None of them are stickers over assembly luckily, and the six stickers this set did have are completely pointless and not necessary for the overall enjoyment of the set at all. They are the weird, cartoony &quot;Aqua&quot; sign on either side of the white brick on top of the archway, and &quot;T4553&quot; printed four times on each corner of the flatbed.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Huge. It&#39;s got a ton of neat features, some work, some don&#39;t, but they tried and I can respect that. I remember loving this thing as a kid because I, like 99 percent of kids, had absolutely no clue how a train was actually washed so I just figured this was as good a way as any and didn&#39;t think about it too hard. Most (though not all) 9v trains fit in this thing and it&#39;s cool to have an extra building on your railway layout, especially on a siding. They designed it to be played with and play with it I did.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money: </strong>It&#39;s always hard to rate this part of sets this old. On one hand, there&#39;s the value of the set back when it came out, which at 30 bucks was just about perfect. The problem is 20+ years have passed since then and nowadays in 2019, the prices on this set can get absolutely ABSURD on the secondhand market. I&#39;ve seen this set going for seriously 300+ dollars on ebay and even on the usually less expensive bricklink it&#39;s 70+ at minimum, with an even higher premium if you want to find it domestically in the USA. As with most ancient Lego, most sellers on Bricklink in my experience with low prices are in other countries with all the fun wait times, international fees, and the like that comes with it.</p>

<p>If you have a time machine and can go pick this thing up for 30 bucks when it first came out, by all means, it&#39;s a great set and well worth that. For 70/100 dollars for a used one it&#39;s extremely expensive these days, and for the usual asking price of 300/400 dollars for a new one, it is in no way shape nor form worth that, just like most Lego sets aren&#39;t.</p>
