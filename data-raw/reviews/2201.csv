It comes with 8 figures, three of them are female, which gives a lot of playability. The design of the building is very detailed, with some safe for money, a small snackbar, some waiting space inside and outside the station and even a small public phone.The colour scheme is a true classic. The little carriage-car is also some nice thing. If you need a train station, and you have some space left for a big building in your town, get this one! You wont regret it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Naylus","2019-11-08T19:26:33.063Z","Perhaps the best Station Design in Lego History","<p>I bought this train station years after its release. It&#39;s best combined with Metroliner&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4558-1/Metroliner"">4558</a>&nbsp;from the same era, but I never got my hands on that wonderful train. Still this building looks very much classic like an old station from the&nbsp;XIXth century perhaps. It would fit perfectly into any Lego town and would welcome passengers from any arriving train.</p>

<p><strong>General overview</strong><br />
The station is made of yellow bricks and is pretty impressive in its design. It could be divided into several areas: the main tower, the ticket office, the restaurant, the waiting hall and the main platform.</p>

<p>The platform is made of three grey blocks, which make access to the station from two sides. Here you can see 2 lampposts, a mailbox, a timetable, as well as classic fences and a bench.</p>

<p>The Ticket office includes windows, where people can buy tickets (obviously), and you actually get a few of them here! The restaurant is more like a kiosk, where passengers can buy food or drinks (a blue cup here).</p>

<p>The opposite side includes a second bench for the passengers waiting for their train.</p>

<p>The main tower has two doors, indicating exit to the city or something similar like that. The second floor here can be accessed by a sort of a ladder. This is the office of the head of the train station.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
There are 8 Lego characters in this set: 4 Train Station employees, 3 passengers and a chef. The railway&nbsp;workers&nbsp;wear classic uniforms with a Train symbol from those days (which would be used later as well). One of them is head of the station obviously, while others provide cargo services or sell tickets. The chef works in the small restaurant or cafe at the station, which is a nice detail to this beautiful building.</p>

<p>The passengers are two girls and a man &ndash; one seems to be a lady from the city. The second girl (with very RARE pigtails) is most likely a hiker, who enjoys nature and plans to take a trip to the suburbs or rural area. The guy with brown hair wears suit and reminds a businessman.</p>

<p><strong>Other Details</strong><br />
The building includes various nice bricks and smaller blocks. The very windows are made of sections, which can be turned into smaller ones in your other creations. I name all the bricks, that simply captivate you, be it the &quot;stucco&quot; or the black roof. The creators included a cargo car for the luggage and added as much as possible details to the whole set. For instance there is a clock, which can be &quot;turned&quot; to show different time.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
As I said earlier, the building looks great by many standards. Even if you don&#39;t have trains per se, the Train Station could easily be turned into some classic Mansion or Palace. It surely looks like one! The very fact, that it was re-released in 1996 as&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/2150-1/Train-Station"">2150</a>, shows that the design was appreciated through years by fans and Lego company a lot.</p>
