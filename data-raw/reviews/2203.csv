"Minifig_Man","2007-12-11T09:16:23.95Z","not such a good station","Although this station is not bad, 2150, 4513, 4554 and  are much better. Looks like a rush job by the designer. It's red, which could be a plus since most of the stations are yellow (4554, 4513 and 7997).

Good: lots of minifigs, nice accessories
Bad: strange luggage cart, platform only slopes on one end, building lacks detail and finesse",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It has a wealth of stickers and plenty of interior details in the cafe and ticket office.  There are also a lot of interesting-looking minifigs.  Unfortunately it was built in the late 1990s, when town-related Lego sets were being over-juniorised.  As such there are no doors and a design which means there's not much scope for alternative building.  Also, the luggage vehicle looks more like a dumper from a building site.  Still, at least most of the pillars are individual pieces rather than pre-fabricated blocks.  A nice, if rather limited, set.  I'd actually give it 3.5.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"sparticusjoe","2018-11-08T16:43:20.223Z","Not nearly the dumpster fire you'd think when you hear ""Town Jr. Train Station"".","<p>I love trains. Always have. I have a huge model railroad and grew up near the Union Pacific southern main line out here in nowhere, Western Texas, so I had a lot of experience around them growing up. To my chagrin, TLC back when I was a kid (less so now though) never really released anything affordable (yes, I know the BNSF/Santa Fe diesels exist, that were insanely expensive and hard to find especially way out here back in the day) that even remotely resembled a realistic diesel locomotive, American or otherwise. That said, younger me learned to enjoy what I had and what I had was the old classic 9v sets.</p>

<p>I really like these sets. The aesthetics of them, while not being super realistic, are neat in their own way, the creativity in them was pretty cool, and even the really odd looking ones an active imagination like myself could usually imagine was something based in reality. Which brings us to this set today. Does it resemble a train station? I mean not really, maybe half of one. Most Lego sets from the time follow this trend, though: They look great from one angle, okay from the other two, and nothing like what they&#39;re supposed to be from the back. This is understandable at least to me and has never bothered me; Lego sets are, at their basest elements, children&#39;s toys made and meant to be interfaced with by human hands so you&#39;re going to need an opening or two to fit said human hands inside of them to do said interfacing. And as far as being a toy made for playing by a kid, this set&#39;s pretty good actually. As far as being a set you can put on display... It&#39;s still not bad honestly.</p>

<p><strong>The Motor Trike: </strong>There are only two elements to this set, with this being maybe 5 percent of it and the station itself being the other 95. I&#39;ll get this one out of the way first. The motorcycle tricycle thing is... It&#39;s fine, I guess. If you&#39;ve read any of my other reviews you know my thoughts on these things but the basic gist is that I don&#39;t particularly like them. The two wheeled motorcycles look more realistic and relatable and pleasing to the eye, and a four wheeled baggage carrier would have been far more realistic and suitable for the job this thing plays, but considering in the late 90&#39;s Lego pretty much abolished two wheeled motorcycles in favor of these things altogether, you get what you get. Replacing this with an MOC baggage cart of literally any other type will make it a more realistic display, but it isn&#39;t bad for what it is. The trailer cart is a cool play feature, it can fit a mailbox or two with baggage and that&#39;s always fun if you&#39;re a little kid. It&#39;s just disappointing TLC didn&#39;t include something that actually exists in the real world for this function. I&#39;ve never, ever, ever seen a three wheeled baggage tricycle in the real world and brother I&#39;ve ridden my fair share of Amtrak before.</p>

<p><strong>The Station: </strong>Now this is where the real meat of the set is. It&#39;s honestly pretty good for what it is. Keeping in mind that it came out in the late 90&#39;s and almost every set from back then in the Town theme had some pretty questionable design choices, it&#39;s downright good compared to what it could have been. The pillars are, astoundingly, made up of multiple round bricks instead of one massive piece like they did with 99 percent of other sets they needed pillars for. There are a lot of plate bricks that are useful in MOC&#39;s, there are a ton of little details in the station, I really like most of the design choices made in this set except one that I hate so much it gave this set a four:</p>

<p>The baseplate. I hate these things. The Cargo Crane dumpster fire of a set released in the same time period had one of these too and I didn&#39;t like it there either. These things are a full two bricks above the ground, making one end of the station just unceremoniously drop a full two brick drop to the surface or any baseplate or floor you may put this set on. These huge ugly and barely useful for anything bricks are extremely hard to find nowadays with bricklink and basically impossible at the time this came out to find an extra one of, so it&#39;s just kind of stuck the way it&#39;s stuck. I built a ramp out of plates back when I was a teenager to make it look a little better because I had zero luck finding a second ramped piece to complete the model. It served its purpose of not having every vehicle fall the equivilent of like four Lego feet to their deaths to get off the elevated roadplate but it never looked very good.</p>

<p>An earlier train station TLC released simply included two ramp bricks so vehicles could get up to the station AND go down off the station, and it just boggles the mind why they didn&#39;t do it here. If you buy the only other set from the time period with the same type of road baseplate, you get... Another straight elevated section, not a ramp. You could have bought two of these sets to complete it but that was unfeasible for a lot of reasons especially if you&#39;re a kid so instead you just got an incredibly obnoxious bad and ugly design decision that you can&#39;t help but think just mounting the station on a regular flat baseplate would have worked a lot better for. The ramp brick you need to complete the set was released in all of like twenty sets ever, none of which are even vaguely common, and even then you need a ton of plates to attach it to this set and not make it look even uglier than it has to be. All in all, this aspect of the set is what we in the business call &quot;bad&quot;.</p>

<p>THAT ALL BEING WHINED ABOUT, it really isn&#39;t bad at all outside of that one aspect. The top floor houses a seating area where one of your passenger friends can enjoy his pizza, and the base floor has a ticket counter with a very cool baggage storage slot in the form of four white L bricks that suitcase bricks fit perfectly between, and a restaurant complete with frying pan, pizza, and a pair of nozzles that I reckoned were drink dispensers. Very cool, as is the clock display and the overhead green spotlights.</p>

<p>There are a ton of minifigures included with this set, some of which are very rare (the TV reporter one, the chef) and all of which fit right at home in your late 90&#39;s vintage Town Jr. town. The window bricks included are all okay, would have been better as multiple pieces but you got multi-piece pillars and you really do have to lower your expectations when it comes to old Town Jr.-era sets.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong> Downright good compared to its peers at the time. You actually build the pillars for once, and the staircase on the back of it is very neat with a very clever little turnstyle brick that is&nbsp; a nice play feature. Nothing to complain about here. It&#39;s not like you&#39;re building the Millenium Falcon here but compared to other sets of the time it&#39;s fine.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>Lots of play feature bricks that are greatly appreciated. The envelope tiles, pizza tiles, cup bricks, money bricks, all that good stuff you can never get too many of are here and they&#39;re great. Tons of round red bricks if you need such a thing, lots of plates, but sadly the old problem most of the old 9v sets have reers its ugly head: loads and loads of stickers.</p>

<p>Town Jr. almost NEVER had stickers from the same era, but for some reason the more expensive and &quot;deluxe&quot; 9v train sets almost always did. No clue why this is, but yep they&#39;re here, yep they&#39;re terrible as always, yep after nearly 20 years of being on display they&#39;ll start to peel, nope there isn&#39;t much you can do about it. The stickers on the windows, flag brick on top, the &lt;-O-&gt; symbol on the top of the trainstation, all of those. They won&#39;t stand the test of time basically at all and you&#39;ll wish they were all printed. Other than that complaint that I can level against basically all sets from the time (Except for ones like 4559 that use so few stickers it&#39;s inconsequential), the parts on display here are fine.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: </strong>Now keep in mind I&#39;m almost 30 so I don&#39;t do a ton of playing, but when I wasn&#39;t and was a young teenager that just really liked him some trains I played with this bad boy a ton and really loved it. It pairs well with 4559 and 4561 and has enough small details to keep you occupied well.</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m a crabby old man that likes to whine about ancient inconsequential Lego sets on the internet, I&#39;m more interested in &quot;displayability&quot; than &quot;playability&quot; and I have to say, it&#39;s... pretty good, actually. There are a ton of interesting poses and scenes you can make, it looks attractive with a train rushing past it, all the other road vehicles from the time fit on the baseplate just fine (they just can&#39;t easily get off without backing up...), and all in all it&#39;s a fine set.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money: </strong>This one&#39;s always hard to rate for something so old. It&#39;s good, but it&#39;s not several hundred dollars worth of good which isn&#39;t unheard of for it to be going for. For fifty bucks it&#39;s worth it, but none of the pieces are *that* exclusive and most of the neat decals aren&#39;t decals at all but are in fact stickers and not printed pieces in the slightest. It&#39;s probably the cheapest of the old style Lego train sets to still get these days at 50+ dollars used and several hundred new, so if you really want some better way for your trains to pick up and drop off passengers than the tiny basically ramps that 4559 and 4561 come with, it&#39;s probably worth getting, but know what you&#39;re getting into, and don&#39;t expect those cool looking decals to still hold up all that well, and do know that the road just sort of... ends. Much like this review.</p>
