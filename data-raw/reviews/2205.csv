Lots of play value, lots of great parts, and much more realistic than the old 12V system. However, unlike some of the later 9V trains, this does actually look like a real train. It also manages a good balance between custom nose pieces and real brick building. There are also some great minifigs and lots of ideas for alternative builds. In short, this set has something for everyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It is even better when combines with two 4547 Club Cars to give you a 5 car train.  The locomotive may need a bit of additional weight to give enough traction, but this doesn't really detract from the set.

"Carl_Sagan","2007-12-19T23:05:59.047Z","The best","This set is the best of the best, undoubtedly a great set waiting to be discovered by any lego fan. this set looks even cooler with the club car, although a bit taller and certainly heavier, makes the train even more real. I dont know who could give this set a con, but a guess it doesn't matter, Its legendary status cannot be tarnished. Although I do wish that they would produce this set a again, due to the design of the front engine car, converting this set to an RC wouldn't be too difficult and could be done buy either TLC or just an owner of the set. Of all the sets I could have again, this would unquestionably be the one.

All the other (9 V) passenger trains are too futuristic or too unrealistic. This one does look like a real train. And it fits perfectly to the train stations 4554 or 2150 (I've got them both).
And of course I like the extension possibilities, I've got the 4547 waggon twice and the original middle waggon on 4558 also twice, which makes ist a really large train. I must admit that I added a second 9V motor at the end of the train.
I love it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-06-26T11:33:50.95Z","Wonderful!","This is an amazing Amtrak-inspired train. You get lots of figures with tools, each train wagon has an individual interior and due to this it offers 1000s of playing possibilities for you. The design is wonderful, as mentioned before, its a true and realistic train, not some spaceship-influenced design out there.
The little train station is a nice addition, of course you need some bigger train station in your city but its good for a beginning.
The interior offers so many lovely details, its fun just to build it over and over or just take the roof away and have a look what happens inside.
You will see a small kitchen, restroom for stewards, a small space with two beds and you can fix all the luggage so it wont fly around in the train when the rail is not straight.

Even bicycles are included and can be transported in a wagon. 

5/5, best 9V passenger train lego made. And the first ;)

"Dr__Kilroy","2008-08-25T17:49:03.687Z","Amazing and beautiful","Many reviewers call this set the best passenger train set create by Lego. Well, maybe 7740 is a slightly better and 4558 is the second best, but does it really matter?
This set is simply fantastic and it (or at least the reissue) is still available MISB on e-Bay or BrickLink. I you get the chance to buy a copy please don't hesitate. If you only want to have one Lego passenger train set in your life, this is your best choice! Add a Club Car to your Metroliner and you'll be a happy man I can guarantee that! The set itself is amazing because it's so realistic with a lot of features and with 11 nice city minifigs which is the highest minifig count in the Lego train set history. Please see both the architecture and the colours that the Metroliner has. They all perfect and beautiful.
A true legend! Don't pass by while you can reach one!    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2020-09-14T21:31:20.147Z","Still THE BEST in 2020s","<p>It took me decades to make the dream come true: I finally bought 4558 via bricklink and I even found the one in a perfect condition in 2020. This particular model has always been a fascination for me, but upon building 4558 I found quite a lot of unimaginable wonderful aspects of Lego design here.</p>

<p><strong>General Overview</strong><br />
The train consists of 3 cars: two locomotives (around 25 cm each)&nbsp;and 1 middle car (24 cm), made of individual grey and black blocks, with stripes (also as bricks mostly), which are reminiscent of those which Amtrak trains had at one point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a 9V train, so each car has a lot of space inside: the 1st locomotive has the cabin, the engine section, as well as a small cafe (nothing very special here though). This one makes the train run and it also has lights.</p>

<p>The middle car has 4 seats with tables, but they are made in such a way, that you can store luggage under them. There is also a small sink&nbsp;there. The 3d car is a locomotive with 2 beds inside 1 compartment, as well as a cargo hold for storing bikes and boxes. All cars have doors (!) with stripes.</p>

<p>The station is quite long (almost 38 cm!) and includes 2 lamp posts, 4 seats and a timetable with 2 fences. Instead of stairs it has a ramp, which allows the loader to roll the red hand truck. The rail loop includes 4 straight and 16 curved rails.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
These include the classic characters of Lego Town from 1980-1990s. There are 3 Railway employees, including a lady serving drinks (a rare thing&nbsp;in Lego trains), as well as 8 passengers. There are several female figures, including the one with the awesome (and rare) black pigtails, which has a special look&nbsp;solely for 4558. One of the passengers is a man in a cowboy hat, that isn&#39;t something you could find in modern City sets. <a href=""https://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/trn040.png"">One citizen</a> has a large red stripe on his shirt, which I find very rare: in fact it&#39;s a minifigure <em>unique to this particular set</em> (and its remake of 2001).</p>

<p><strong>Why 4558 is&nbsp;still SO good</strong><br />
I have three trains, including <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7897-1/Passenger-Train"">7897</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7715-1/Push-Along-Passenger-Steam-Train"">7715</a>. While it&#39;s difficult to compare the three, I would say, that 4558 takes the best from its predecessors like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7745-1/High-Speed-City-Express-Passenger-Train-Set"">7745</a>, but evolved in terms of details: it has different doors for passengers and cargo, a nice cabin and a more advanced and stylish nose parts, not to mention realistic pantographs.</p>

<p>I already mentioned, that this set has very good bricks in the design, and some of them are somehow new to me, including the inside engine, the sink, etc. The train uses a slightly different approach in building the wheels, not like in the 7897, with more bricks making it somehow more sturdy. Also the bottom section doesn&#39;t use &#39;one-brick&#39; blocks, but instead are made from many ones. In general the train feels full of cool decisions, useful for nice design and playability.</p>

<p><strong>Speaking of... Playability</strong><br />
There is no doubt this train is 100% full of potential to be part of any game or worthy collection. Even though it&#39;s obvious, you could make a lot of new models with this set (785 parts vs 474 in 7897, 295 in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4511-1/High-Speed-Train"">4511</a>,&nbsp;669 in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7938-1/Passenger-Train"">7938</a>, 610 in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60051-1/High-speed-Passenger-Train"">60051</a>, etc), Lego were more than generous to include instructions for a second variant of build with 4558 &ndash; a semi-cargo train with a passenger car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The train can be expanded with the Double-deck bedroom car of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4547-1/Railroad-Club-Car"">4547</a>, sold separately.</p>

<p>I must add, that this train looks absolutely hilarious together with the stately Grand Lego station of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4554-1/Metro-Station"">4554</a>. With the splendour of this magnificent yellow building 4558 Metroliner looks wholesome and somehow as a complete piece of art from its creators.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros and Cons</strong><br />
Well, the positive sides are obvious. There is one thing which might be a disadvantage: the transformer and speed regulator is a different set (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4548-1/Transformer-and-Speed-Regulator"">4548</a>) and must be purchased separately in order to make this train run.</p>

"Lolbrick","2009-11-13T14:02:03.983Z","Absolutely the most brilliant Lego train set out there, but when it comes to Lego there's always cons.","Now I simply love this train, it's the best passenger train in Lego out there and has been for soon 19 years!
I got it back 1995 when I was 10 and had a lot of fun with it for almost 2 years.

The design of this set is outstanding and from far sight you'd think it wasn't even in Lego, so comes to the station which is quite simple but brilliant nevertheless,
and the inside is extreamly well done too, the first Locomotive has an engine and a shop, however I think the shop could've been better since it contains nothing more than two desks and four cups which seems abit... empty.

The second Locomotive has a bagage which can contain all the accesories which I might add are lots of.
The cons with the second Locomotive would be that they should've had a red flashlight instead of a yellow and I would suggest that you buy an extra motor so both lights works!

Now to the wagon.
It has the best details! Tables which has the abbility to contain suitcases and it also has a tap, yet leaving space for walkthrought and many seats.

Also, I do not like the empty gaps when you go by the walkthought, they could've added a window or something like that, I mean else the passengers will get sucked out, lol...

This set is despite the cons I wrote a masterpiece in Lego trains and is a must have, realistic, many minifigures and accesories!
No wonder it's still the king since 1991!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"friggityfrag7","2019-07-22T06:34:03.21Z","The definitive LEGO Train ","<p>As part of the Holy Trinity for Lego train collectors (the other two being the Emerald Night and Santa Fe Superchief), this&nbsp;set has been my white whale for years after first encountering the set in various brickfilms from the&nbsp;early 2000s and the Lego Loco PC game. The iconic Amtrak style train has remained highly sought after by many fans of the train theme with even used copies going for more than 240 dollars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What the set Includes:</p>

<p>The train&nbsp;consists of two locomotives. The first one is powered with the interior consisting of the conductor&#39;s controls, a brick-built engine and a shop with some cups for sale. The other locomotive is unpowered with sleeping quarters for the passengers, an area to store luggage and another set of controls for the driver. The middle carriage has four seats, tables with luggage compartments and a sink.</p>

<p>Enough to track to make an oval as well as a speed regulator</p>

<p>Eleven Minifigures are included with two bikes, various suitcases, two packages which are&nbsp;yellow bricks with a sticker, a hand truck and a handheld sign</p>

<p>There is also a platform with a time table, streetlamps, and seats.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also instructions for an alternate build which makes a double-ended locomotive, a modified passenger carriage and some kind of open-air baggage car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience</p>

<p>The overall experience is pretty straightforward but does have the classic LEGO charm. I will have to knock down a star for building experience since the older instructions are a bit harder&nbsp;read and some parts such as the placement of the&nbsp;bogies as well as the control area being a bit annoying to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Aside from the obvious parts like the wheels, bogies, motor, and track. There is a great selection of parts to use. Large plates, street lamps, fences, printed doors, regular and skinny windows, printed control panel tiles and even faucet piece</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>With 11 minifigs and a ton of accessories, it is hard to beat this set when putting it up against later passenger trains as most only include around 3-5 minifigs. The station is also easily twice as long as other station builds in train sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thoughts</p>

<p>A problem many people seem to have with some of the more modern train sets is that they seem pretty bare bone. Examples would be 60051 which has no doors and only 3 minifigs&nbsp;as well as 4511 which straight up&nbsp;is missing the third carriage. This set is not the case, all 11 minifigs can pretty much fill up the train comfortably. Each carriage is packed with features instead of just throwing in seats in all 3&nbsp;and calling it a day. And while I do love all the trains that Lego has put out the Metroliner&nbsp;just feels the most complete.&nbsp;While the prices for this set may be high it is a must-have for all Lego train fans and even classic Lego fans. It sets the bar for how a Lego passenger train should be.&nbsp;</p>
