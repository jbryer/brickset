It has a lot of bricks, no juniorized and no specialized pieces. This was the last great train set before the juniorization years. The only tiny problem with it is that it has only a pair of magnetic couplings but extra could be bought at a low cost. While, it may not have doors and may not really 'work' with train stations, it's still great because it looks like a high speed train. The idea of containers is really neat and the truck is also very detailed. It was really worth the money. In conclusion, yes it is not very realistic, but that doesn't mean it is not great!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-22T07:45:08Z","Nice Set","I got this set for christmas when i was about 11.  I thought it was really cool but needed more of a loading station like the metroliner.  The ability of the compartments to be moved is pretty cool.  I like the color scheme and think that it is overall a cool train to have with my town.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T03:00:38Z","no masterpiece, but..","..still a very fine set to play with. i don't have the metroliner and don't want it, because the 4559 looks more like a high speed train. of course it lacks some realism, but you can rebuild it if you like, because it fits well into any modern lego-town. lots of minifigs, lots of parts, windows, and other small stuff. this one will probably remain my only passenger train.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-04-06T19:44:04.233Z","Blacktron Express","A truly original design, and with a colour scheme (black and yellow) which ought to be used more often in Lego sets.  This train has compartments which are not built into the main model and can therefore be changed around.  There's also a van for carrying the compartments, not to mention cargo holds to carry luggage, refuelling equipment and so on.  With lots of attention to detail and loads of useful pieces, this is a treat.

"Nesquik","2011-04-16T06:22:47.733Z","An underrated classic","It was my very first LEGO train, and I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the series. Interestingly, I was very to lucky to even get this set as I recall that it was about to discontinued in late 1998, and so we snatched the 'very last' set from a store in town. Talk about luck!<div><br></div><div>Sadly the set was sold many years, and this has been truly regretted by the whole family since. The playability of this set is just fabulous, almost incomparable to the modern Passenger Trains. Although like others I agree that set 4558 (Metroliner) is 'the' classic Passenger Train, this set tried something different as it was more of a modern concept. It is not modeled on any specific real-life train, but this isn't negative point.</div><div><br></div><div>In fact, it is the highlight of the set. The main feature of this train is that the two passenger wagons are totally customisable. In short, there are 4 compartments that can be removed and placed on the tenders, which allows the little station truck to drive up the ramp, hook itself up to any of the compartments, and drive away. These compartments, as per the first instructions in the manual, feature bedding areas and dining areas. They are opened by simply pulling the sides 'down' revealing all the detail inside which is very nice.</div><div><br></div><div>At the end of each wagon are separate compartments to hold goods. This is particularly nice as they are shaped like small boxes which can hold coins or letters/mail, and they can slot nicely on the back of the station wagon, just as the passenger compartments did! The nicest one is the fuel box, which has a hose rolled up in side. Brilliant.</div><div><br></div><div>Obviously these features, whilst incredibly well thought out and detailed, pose authenticity problems - such as how on earth would the passengers enter the compartments. This is the only issue I can find with this set, but to be honest in my younger years I didn't think about it too much.</div><div><br></div><div>The station truck is a very nice vehicle and has that 90's balance of non-unique elements with the right colours and scale. However, I think the yellow and black colour combination works wonderfully over the entire set.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, there is obviously the ramp which is fairly straightforward, but contains 'clocks' on each barrier (LEGO men obviously don't have watches!) and the barriers themselves are spring loaded. They're slightly short, but not a problem.</div><div><br></div><div>I would say in short that this is actually a very underrated set. It is possibly the last great 9V set in terms of playability, and in terms of value it contains a lot more features and pieces than earlier sets.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-16T04:49:03.703Z","LEGO Trains (9V) - Cargo Railway Review","This train is my only train I got and I'm really glad to have it. It has lot's of play features and we also get a few stickers which we need to put on. The truck looks very awsome as well and it can take away the cabins from that train. There's also a ramp with some sviwel gates and the locomotive looks very nice as well. The the trailer can be attached to the locomotive and the other one can be attached to the other trailer with the magnet. There're also a few containers inside the trailers which you can slide out. This train set also comes with 4 cabins. 2 cabins have a bedroom and the other 2 have a restaurant. You can open those cabins very easily and the minifigs will fit in very easy as well. I really can't complain about that and we also get a nice track for the train and a transformer which you can use to make this train moving on the tracks.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"whaleyland","2012-02-07T03:54:10.183Z","LEGO As An AfterThought: The Train for Pod People","<p>Many years ago, I&#39;d say around June 1996, I purchased my first LEGO Train, the Cargo Railway. It was a beauty. Sleek. Compact. It had a loading ramp. It included the engine and speed regulator (though I had to buy the lights separately). Everything about it I loved. Then sixteen years passed...</p>

<p><strong>Innovations:</strong> At the time it released, the Cargo Railway was cutting edge for LEGO. Previously, all the 9v trains had either been freight trains or the Metroliner. The Cargo Railway was the first 9v train to break the mold. It was short, sleek, and long. It had pods for dining and sleeping compartments, two of each. It also included four smaller pods for mail, money, fuel, and luggage. It came with props too. A truck to unload the pods (both types) and a ramp to get to the tracks. All-in-all, the innovations over the Metroliner were obvious, though not necessarily preferred.</p>

<p><strong>Lack of Inspiration: </strong>What the set failed to do was compare adequately to reality. Passenger trains don&#39;t come in pod form. They come through large carriages, like the Metroliner had. There were no doors, no corridors. Indeed, the pods had to be opened from the top! And worst of all, they required a truck with a disingenuous connector to unload the pods before they could be opened. &quot;Cargo&quot; railway was right. This set, despite appearing as a passenger train and functioning as one, treated the passengers like cargo! The theme just didn&#39;t make sense and still doesn&#39;t. Future trains would avoid the pod aspect that this train attempted just because of its impracticality.</p>

<p><strong>What it Got Right: </strong>The train did get something right: it looks beautiful when cruising. When all the pods are in place, it drives like a new BMW. It looks sleek, the colors are a great contrast, and the angle of the large cars make the train appear to have a motion blur. All very good. The train also included the speed regulator, motor, and tracks, all things some sets, especially the freight trains, were sorely lacking. Because of the loading ramp, two straight tracks were even included, which was extra nice. The presence of seven mini figures certainly made for an improvement over some other LEGO Train sets before and since. Needless to say, when you opened and built this set, you felt like you got your money&#39;s worth.</p>

<p><strong>Possible Improvements: </strong>Listing all the possible improvements to this set is impossible. The build was just too strange. But skipping over the obvious things, it would have been nice if the loading ramp were made into a full level crossing to allow the truck to drive over the tracks rather than just up to them. Also, there is no place for passengers to wait or be loaded into the pods. Kids just have to use their imagination in this regard. Finally, the lack of the headlights for the train was a rather weak omission. Considering the lights only cost $5 on lego.com at the time, it seems strange that they left them out when they included all the other electronics parts. Low blow, LEGO.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures: </strong>As already mentioned, this set comes with seven of them! None were overly unique, but they were a good selection from the LEGO Town theme. With the set came a Paradisa girl with black hair and a tight, lipsticked face; a female doctor, with the same hair and face as the Paradisa girl; an Octan operator with a normal smily face; a police officer; brown leather jacket guy, with his usual shades and red baseball hat; a Train worker wearing his red vest, a white helmet, and a mustache; and lastly a Train conductor wearing a yellow suit and red hat. Not a bad collection at all.</p>

<p><strong>How it Compares: </strong>This set was not the cheapest passenger train by far, but it also has been surpassed many times in price. It is not as good as the Metroliner or Emerald Night by far, but it surpasses virtually all other 9v LEGO Trains released before or since. It certainly is the third best passenger train, though many of the freight trains over the years could probably be considered better, especially the Santa Fe Super Chief, BNSF, and Maersk engines.&nbsp;</p>

"traincrazy","2014-06-03T00:50:30.52Z","One Set to Start them All","<p>This was the one set that started it all for me. I saved up all my money in 1996 from report cards and lemonade sales to buy this set. It has lasted all these years and still has it&#39;s awesome moments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes the configuration of the removable compartments doesn&#39;t make much sense as an adult, but to a kid that used every part of every set to have the most fun, I played for hours upon hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Fact that you could connect the compartment with the truck and additionally carry one of the mini &nbsp;bins was even better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes the track was small but it fit around the Christmas Tree.</p>

<p>I will forever cherish and love this set and it will be my kids some day.</p>

"chinnant","2016-05-10T00:47:26.923Z","My Least Favorite of the 9V Passenger Trains","<p>While I love the classic 9v trains from 1991-2001, this one really annoys me for some reason. I bought it off of Bricklink&nbsp;about 2 months ago for a great bargain (about 60 dollars complete), and was quite happy. Don&#39;t get me wrong, this is a decent train set, and having a brick-build nose beats having one large molded piece, but what really annoys me is that this train does not scale correctly with my other trains, like the Railway Express. For some reason, this train is much smaller and also skinnier than almost all of my trains (And I own over 47 individual train cars)</p>

<p>It is what you would expect from the era, and they are fine.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I like the use of Yellow &quot;Low-Boy&quot; train bases, aswell as the same front pieces as the Metroliner.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I like the minifigures here. Nothing too special, but a good variety of classic vintage town characters. The inclusion of an Octan employee is nice.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It went together well, although the engine being free standing is a bit tedious for me.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think the completed model is decent. As I said earlier, I wish it was a bit taller. However, I like the color scheme and feel like the colors used are different from the other 9v trains from this era.</p>
