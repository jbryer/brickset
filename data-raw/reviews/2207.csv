somewhere someone mentioned that this train was inspired by the train of the euro-tunnel (connecting france and the uk), so it has a hypermodern design with lots of glas (why? to watch the tunnel walls?) and an aerodynamic front. it may be not the prettiest train, and it may not look so modern anymore, but the parts that come in this set are quite useful: window panes, split-level waggon bases, many people, and a train motor, wheels, and track. 
it is even still available in some shops, so why not buy it and have a nice train-extension-pack?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
