Excellent alternate models! One day, I decided to take the whole thing apart and make something toattaly differant, and put the leftover parts in plastic bags/ So I did. I put all of them in 1 bag. The bag popped open, and all the parts have been lost ever science. I am looking for the parts. I love this set. THE BEST. EVER.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

- a cargo car
- a lot of figures

"mhoeij","2009-12-02T08:49:03.717Z","great for kids","My favorite feature of this train set is its price, I bought two and a half copies of this
set  on eBay about a year ago because of the price (including shipping this was
still below $100).

This train (4 cars plus 2 engines, one in the front and one in the back) was sitting parked
on a side-track when I had a lego layout at the annual local train show here, but kids
liked this train so much that they wanted to see it run (even though there was plenty of
good stuff on the track, metroliner, Santa Fe, BNSF, Emerald night, hobby train, etc).

So kids thought this train was great, even compared to the best lego trains.

The main problem is of course the very unrealistic engine.  Kids don't mind, but I do,
so I decided to disassemble the two engines and combine them, plus some spare parts,
into one more realistic engine (this engine is now slightly longer than the cars but
from a distance it looks about the same length). This way I ended up with a nice
5-feet train below $100.

In summary, if you're buying this for the kids, they'll love it as it is. If you're buying
this for yourself, you may want to make some changes to the engine.

My rating:  for kids this is a clear winner..  For adults, well, there is a reason why
this train is cheaper on eBay than pretty much any other lego train, but remember,
this is lego, you can always fix the things you don't like.

"BionicleBOOM","2009-02-16T09:01:08.293Z","I use it every year on Christmas to drive around the tree","Okay, I got this one year for Christmas, took me a couple days to build it, and when I did, I loved it.  I still do; I have it with me up in my room in a Rubbermaid.  It's just that there's no place to put it.  Oh well.  Anyway, I like to use this set every year to set up around the Christmas tree, kinda like a new version of the Polar Express chugging around the tree.
This set includes an electric front, to pull the train forward at pretty good speeds.  The two cars include a passenger car and a vehicle car.  There are three other vehicles: a red car, a yellow car of the same sort, and a truck.  Unfortunately, I've broken up the yellow car, but I still have the red one and the truck.  The truck has clips in the bed to place the cargo boxes that are included.  The boxes contain 1. a crystal with two $100 pieces, 2. a pizza and two glasses, 3. some baggage.  There is a loading ramp with a raising and lowering bar on the front to load the cars and truck onto the train.  A very good set overall, worth the money.

Pros:

-The train goes fast

-Put it around the Christmas tree

-A lot of minifigs

-Vehicles

-Loading ramp

-Departure times sign on the ramp

-$100 pieces

-WARNING: EXTREMELY FUN

Cons:

-Cars are a little realistic, but are more realistic than earlier cars

Overall, 5/5.  Get it if it's available.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Lolbrick","2009-08-22T13:24:22.467Z","One of the best sets ever created.","Now I usually don't buy lego sets anymore since I feel they lack much realism so I use to build my own with Leocad but I gotta say that this one is an extreamly well done piece of artwork, I remember when I was younger and that much of details wasn't required, when I saw it I just dropped my jaw and without hessitating I bought it and took it home and started to build it.
I found it extreamly creatively designed for bein' a market set and has lot of figures with lot of accesories and on top of that 3 cars and a nice station, if you ever find this one, don't hessitate to buy it, it's a realistic and detailed set which is fun to build and also fun to play with!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Nopjes","2011-05-23T06:45:07.92Z","Not the most beautiful train, but full of surprises...","I bought this train second hand from a boy who felt he had grown too old for Lego (Dark Ages are upon him).&nbsp;<br><br>The main reason I bought it was this is the motorised version : I could use the engine and the speed regulator. And maybe even more important : the train was provided with a huge extra lot of 9V-tracks and 8 points (much more than in the original set)! The original layout consist of 16 curves and 2 straight pieces of rail.<div><br></div><div>Personally, I don't like the design that much, but off course everybody has a different taste.&nbsp;The stickers applied to the train (some of them from other sets) had hardened and literally broke into tiny pieces when I touched them. I chose to remove the stickers on the outside of the train, because I didn't like them anyway.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Let me take a look at the train in detail :&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>First, <b>the locomotive / driver cabin</b>:&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In another review I read that it's too small and I share that opinion. It's a pity LEGO didn't build it to be a full carriage. When I started ""dissecting"" the train, I thought that the kid that sold me the train had changed the cockpit to match his taste. It didn't seem to be something designed by LEGO. I was especially surprised to find some decorated elements hidden underneath a brick. What the idea behind that is, I don't know. Very strange to discover that the cockpit design was completely according to the manual. Why does LEGO hide decorated elements underneath another brick when there's no reason you would look there unless you dismantle the set ?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The ""hidden elements"" consist of a grey 1x2 tile with tape icon, a fluo yellow 1x2 plate (yuk!) and, a more pleasant suprise, a 2x2 tile with keyboard, clock and thermometer (<a href=""http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/3068bp80"">http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/3068bp80</a>). That one has been used in 13 sets only, I had never seen that element before.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://media.peeron.com/pics/inv/custpics/3068bp80.1129788274.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><br></div><div>Since I'm not fond of the design of the locomotive nor its size, I'm considering a drastic makeover into a full carriage.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Wagon 1 : Passengers</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>This part has some features that I've never seen again in LEGO train carriages : a cinema screen and something that seems to be a food vending machine. I like those ideas ! The wagon contains a (multi-leveled) seating area in front of the screen, with space for luggage on both sides of the seats. On the other side there is a table with two chairs, a pizza and two glasses. I like the way these wagons open : the side of the wagon opens up like the wing door of a sports car. It makes the wagon very accessable, though it might knock some passengers&nbsp;off&nbsp;a station platform :-)</div><div><br></div><div>On both ends of the wagon there's a room for small cargo containers. Five containers come with this set, containing pizzas, luggage, cash and gems, tools and a smaller container featuring an Octan pump.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Wagon 2 : cars</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>This is one of the few LEGO train sets to feature a car compartment, and this one is very special : where other sets carry the cars on a flatbed, the cars in wagon number 2 are really <u>inside</u>&nbsp;the train. This means the cars are small (4 studs wide), but they are creative. Both cars, a red and yellow one, are identical and they have a neat feature : they have a rare wind screen that folds down for easy storage. It kind of gives them an oldtimer look. Both small cars are stored at the outer ends of the wagon, above the wheels. They are held in place by a hinge that becomes a ramp when folded down : smart !</div><div><br></div><div>The small delivery truck (that can carry one container) can be put in the mid section. This wagon has the same door as the passenger car : very easy to get to the cars.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><b>Platform</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>This set includes a platform featuring 3 seats, a time table and a small ramp with barrier that enables the cars to get on the train. Unfortunately, there are some fluo yellow plates included, I really don't like fluo LEGO parts. The platform consists of one ramp piece, enlarged with a plate for the seats and time table. It's rather small, since the biggest part is taken by the ramp. I enlarged mine with matching platform elements, similar to the ramp element.&nbsp;</div><div><br><b>General Remarks</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>This is (even though I'm not really fond of its look) a very nice train, especially because it features some very creative details.&nbsp;One downside for me is the length of the wagons : 36 studs in length, the longest wagons I own. Because of their length, they are difficult to ride on track that has a steep angle (going up or down), especially when there is a small ""bump"" where the track goes from steep to horizontal position. In my LEGO layout, there is a ramp with a track leading from the airport into a tunnel that passes behind a big piece of furniture. This train has difficulties with it... Nevertheless, once this train has been modded, it will be the perfect car-train !</div><div><br><br></div><div><br></div>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,4
"Mr__Mini_Man","2010-11-25T09:53:59.17Z","Very big and futuristic","<p><strong>This was</strong> my very first set. It boasts many great features including a 9V motor. Best of all, it has many minifigures and cars. There is a wide range of accessories too, including a radio and some pizza. If you don't like the set though, you can destroy it for it's wide range of blue pieces. The minifigures include a conductor, a banker, an X-Treme team member, and a couple other civilians.

<ul>
<li>Banker: A fine minifigure. Has a nice jacket and ID card. 
<li>Aviator?:Has a very cool and rustic coat. Other then that, a little plain 
<li>Conductor:LEGO did a great job with the conductors blue jacket. Has an akward face. 
<li>Engineer: Has the yellow jacket seen in most train sets.&nbsp;Boasts a nice hat.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X-Treme team member: It's nice that LEGO combined two themes to give variety. A very cool minifigure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintnece man: Kinda plain. Looks like an average railway worker to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Civilian: I love this minifigure. He has a very nice coat and shirt.</p>

<ul>
<li>Engine: only part of set I don't like. Far too small. 
<li>Passenger car: Has theater seating and a movie screen. Also has a table and a food display screen. A very detailed car. 
<li>Cargo Car: Holds&nbsp;cars and truck that come with the set. The cargo car does not have much to it though.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Red and yellow car: Both look the same but boast different colors. Both are very old fashioned looking (as far as LEGOs go). Each has 1 seat for a minifigure.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cargo truck: This is a very cool truck. It is black and green and carrys 1 of 3 cargo crates that contain food, luggage, and an AquaZone crystal. 1 of my favorite parts of this set.</p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2013-12-23T04:20:51.15Z","A nice, sleek passenger train set.","<p>I received this set as a present for Christmas of... hm... 2000, I believe. It was the big thing that year. It was my first proper LEGO train set as well as my first electric train set. I had jolly good fun building it, though I was given trouble a couple of times by my own misreading of the instructions. I got it built right in the end, and had loads of fun with it, driving the train around, loading and unloading it, and mingling it with minifigures from other lines (Qui-Gon Jinn, Jar-Jar Binks, and King Leo were frequent passengers, and on that Christmas Day when I first built it Qui-Gon and King Leo got into a traintop battle against Darth Maul). I did eventually break it up to build MOC Thomas the Tank Engine stuff (as well as motorize a later set), but I have on occasion rebuilt it and had some more fun.<br></p><p>I mentally divide this set into four groupings: The train itself (including its driver), the cars and the flatbed pickup truck and the containers, the platform and passengers and other staff, and the track.<br></p><p>The train itself has something of a futuristic look to it, and is comprised of three vehicles: A small diesel locomotive (I'd have preferred steam but you can't have everything), a coach, and a vehicle carrier externally identical to the coach. The windows of the latter two are continuous, somewhat giving the appearance of a train made of articulated segments rather than separate coaches. <br>*The vehicle carrier is assembled first. It and the coach are built on the longer drop frames rather than the standard 6x24 train plate. The ends are used as bays for the two small cars, while the pit section serves as a bay for the pickup. Two friction-hinged panels (the same type used for the Comlink Cruiser's computer screen) act as ramps. The drop frame also accommodates a design feature that both helps the train's sleek appearance and makes play easier: The sections of the side that dip into the pit are giant gull-wing doors.<br>*The coach is the next to be built. The construction of roof and sides is nearly identical to the vehicle carrier, but stacks of 3 2x4 bricks wall off the end platforms from the pit section. Two of the set's stickers come into play here, being placed on the inner faces of each stack: A display of food items on the front stack (suggesting perhaps a vending machine or other food dispenser), and a display of a space background on the back stack to create a movie screen. There are five red chairs inside. Two of them are positioned facing each other, with a table between them, at the front. The other three face the movie screen, and are staggered in elevation so that passengers can see. There are 1x2 tile-with-wall mini-fence pieces on either side of a seat, to give storage space for luggage. Very thoughtful. The ends of the car have pairs of 1x6 tiles to sit containers on, with 1x2 sloped handle pieces acting as stop-blocks.<br>*Last is the engine. It is short, and built on a base piece that I don't think has been used in many, if any, other sets. The cab is cramped, such that the driver has to sit down. Due to its length, or lack thereof, it is mounted fixed-in-place on the 9-volt motor block. There is an electric lightbrick included, as well as a light-piping brick that plugs into sockets on the base piece to create the train's lamps and make sure the lightbrick lights them up properly.</p><p>The passengers must reach the station somehow, and the company needs a way to move individual containers around their facilities, and so we get two cars, one flatbed pickup truck, and four (and a half) containers. The cars and truck are the then-still-standard four-stud-wide one-seater affairs, but they look decent.<br>*The cars are topless, and identical in design but not color (One is red, one is yellow). Each has a hinged windshield, a classic steering wheel, and a slot in the back that holds a suitcase.<br>*The pickup truck is black and green, and has a sunroof. The flat bed can hold one container.<br>*There are four full-size containers (4x4 footprint plus protruding handles), which open up via paired 1x2 bricks with Technic pin hinges, and one half container with no hinge. Three of the full-size containers are hollow inside for holding loose objects. One is for food (A couple of pizzas here), one is for luggage, one is for valuables (Here represented by some $100-print 1x2 tiles and a crystal). The fourth full-size container has ""Horizontal hand""-type pieces for holding tools. The half-size container has a fuel pump and an Octan clock 1x2 brick also seen in the ""Power Pitstop"" set.</p><p>Of course, no railway could stay in business without customers, staff, and stations.<br>*The station is a simple affair, built off of a large ramp baseplate. A safety gate keeps cars from driving up prematurely. On the platform there are a few amenities: A couple of seats for waiting passengers, a digital arrival/departure timetable, and a stereo that uses a 1x2 brick for the body and a telephone handset piece for the handle.<br>* There are 4 passengers, two maintenance/loading workers, and a conductor. The passengers are a varied bunch: A banker, a skier, a female member of the EXtreme Team (sadly no flame-splashed green helmet, though), and an an average guy who could be a lot of things.</p><p>Lastly, what kind of daft railway doesn't have any rails? Included for the train to run on is a basic oval. 18 curved pieces for the curve sections, and two straight tracks, and a transformer/speed regulator to supply the power and control the train.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Sleek-looking streamlined passenger train<br></li><li>Comes with lots of windows and long bricks that can be used for other building other things (like buildings).<br></li><li>Motorized, allowing for driving fun, as well as being cannibalized for the motor bogie and the other wheels to motorize things like the first and second Hogwarts Express sets.</li><li>Nice selection of passengers and staff.</li><li>Comes with some neat accessories and other special parts.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>There are only two straight pieces, meaning that the station platform can serve only one of the train vehicles at a time even if modified to be longer.<br></li><li>No flame-decorated helmet for the Xtreme Team member.</li><li>Could have been made standard train height, maybe squeeze in some more seating that way.<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, this is a nice set to have, and worth buying if you can find it for close enough to the retail price. You get a complete train and its crew, a colorful set of passengers, a simple-but-easy-to-expand-later station, some nice classic-size automobiles, and even some support staff. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
