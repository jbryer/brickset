The car can be built into three different models but the one on the box is by far the best one. None of the models are really anything special but there&#39;s not much you can do with 23 pieces.</p>

<p>Parts: As before mentioned there are only 23 pieces in this set and none of them are anything special. There is a steering wheel and that&#39;s about as exciting as it gets.</p>

<p>Playability: The playability for this set is just as good as any other car set. It can drive around, crash, and park. That&#39;s really all there is to it.</p>

<p>Value For Money: The value for money is great for this set. Having 23 parts and costing&nbsp;$3.95 originally, it isn&#39;t too bad. What really makes this worth it is the minifig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifig: The reason that the minifig makes the set worth it is because it is so fun. It has a very fun shark shirt and a very exciting head. Also, the fact that minifigs&nbsp;tend to cost around $3 on Bricklink, getting one with a few extra parts is well worth it.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall the set itself deserves about 2 stars but since the minifig is so great I bumped it up one more.</p>
