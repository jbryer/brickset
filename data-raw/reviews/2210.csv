"lostcarpark","2007-04-07T07:01:45.66Z","Beautiful!","Everything you need to start a freight railway. Lots of added extras to add play value - the fork-lift for loading containers onto wagons, the tractor in the container, the box car. It also has alternative model instructions, something sadly missing from most current sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-13T12:05:31.903Z","My second train set","This was my second train set. Just one month before it I got maintenance vehicle 4546 for my birthday, which was my first train set. But with 4563 my love for LEGO trains really started! I got it in 1991 as a Christmas present. Though I knew what I was getting, waiting for December 24th was very hard. When I finally had it in my hands, assembling it was a pleasure. The diesel engine looks absolutely great. It's ideal for work at the sidings. This means it's task - among others - is to put together waggons and take care of freight waggons that have recently arrived. One very nice piece is the big red train window, which is part of the driver's cab. When you open the little red doors on the left and right side of the front part of the engine, you can see an imitation of a real motor built with gray bricks. The only thing that the diesel engine does not have is a working light. I cannot tell you if it is difficult to install it and if many bricks have to be removed by adding it. I've never tried to build it in. 

Apart from the nice engine, you get three waggons. It's the waggon with the roof and the sliding doors that looks a bit empty. You can put the motorbike in it. But if you buy it, I hope you have some more motorbikes or anything else to put in that waggon. And the sliding doors also fall off quickly. That's quite annoying. So be careful when you lift it.

The forklift is great, but the spring becomes very overexpanded in the course of time - especially if you play with it as much and fanatically as my brother and I did. After intensive playing it will be of no use. 

Anyway, it's a superb set and I can only recommend it to everyone who likes trains or wants to get started with 9V trains.

Oh, before I forget it: the instructions also show you how to build an alternate model.

I got this as a Christmas present and was my happiest day of my child life. lol. This set was the best! I loved the forklift and how it worked perfect with the Octan set #4537. 

I still have this set and plan to give it to my kids once they are old enough.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Emersonac","2021-10-14T18:12:10.973Z","Review of 4563","<p>A beautiful set. It has a 9V loco, a flatbed, a gondola and a boxcar. The loco has fake lights, an engine and opening doors. The flatbed is yellow, not much to say about it. The gondola&#39;s flaps can be opened, allowing for easy cargo access. The boxcar is nice, has sliding doors.</p>

<p>Overall, I recommend this!</p>
