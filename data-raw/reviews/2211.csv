I still play with it !",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
-Great engine(my favorite of all lego trains)
-Good 4 stud wide 6668 replica truck
-Great way of dumping cargo with wheels
-Interesting loading platform
-All around great cars (best freight cars 'of train 9v sets'in my opinion)

Cons:
-Hopper car should have a wheel on both sides for releasing cargo (not one on one side and a technic brick on the other side)
-Hopper should have an top layer of white flat bricks (like the flats in 4536).  This would give it a sleeker look and it would also be the same height as 4536.

Overall amazing set and goes great with 4536.  Recommended",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-12-04T10:36:53.263Z","Wow!","I got this set second hand on eBay and I was so happy when it had arrived! It looked like new! There was no dust. The former owner must have kept it in a box where no dust could get on the bricks. And all the stickers had not been used! I did not put the stickers on the train. I think the set is more precious when the stickers remain unused.

The engine is definitely the greatest thing about the set! It looks brilliant! Yellow and black are obviously colours that can produce something superb when they are combined! It doesn't have a working light, but so what? I haven't tried to add it. I don't know if it's difficult to do so, but the engine is even great without it. The engine has some small doors. You can open them to see its motor. 

The waggons are also excellent. They offer a lot of playability. The hopper waggon is nice and it has an unload mechanism that works without problems. The post waggon is cool as well. The waggon is divided into two sections; one is reserved for parcels. Then there is a freight waggon for truck containers including a platform. The platform is needed by the truck so it can reach the container on the waggon easily. 

You get three minifigs and the instructions show you how to build an alternate model. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I remember getting it for one Christmas after long deciding over some train sets. It was also our (my brother's and mine) biggest and most complex set to build. <br><p>I like that there are two models for locomotive and the fact that the lights are not working is definitely not a problem.<br></p><p>Playing with the set was excellent and in combination with some home made tunnel, train station, caffe etc it was the ultimate game.<br></p><p>I recently, at age 22, rediscovered enjoying LEGO and I'm driving the train as i type :)<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p><p>Recommended.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
