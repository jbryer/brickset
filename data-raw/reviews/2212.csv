"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-25T14:19:53Z","_","This was my second LEGO train set. Unlike my first set, 4559 Cargo Railway, this is way better. It has two working cranes that can be mounted on the crane structure thingy and a working scale that is accurate with the 4557 Freight Loading Station. All the other stuff is awesome too.

"Mark","2005-07-23T06:17:17Z","_","This is the biggest Cargo Train ever and my 2nd train.
I bought this in the 1998,from there i bought a lot of sets to make it more big,the 4552,4525,4532,rails and other.
But only with the start set is possible make a lot of things.
I love this set and i still play with it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-10T13:00:56.153Z","My First Train","This is very big train set. It comes with a locomotive, three train cars, truck, station with two cranes and weights, two concrete mixers, three sand holders, crate, toolkit, and three minifigures. There is enough rails to make an oval, but it would be better to get some extra rails as well.  

Pros:
-Nice looking locomotive
-Cargo can be picked up by cranes from train vagons and loaded to truck and visa versa
-Lots of usefull accesories
-Weights work if made properly
-Fun to build
-Has 9V engine
-Locomotive has working lights
-Great minifigures
-Decent length of rails
-Roadpiece
-Crane pillars

Cons:
-Could have used more minifigures(train worker or mechanic)
-Could have came with a speed regulator

For some reason, on the box it shows that there are two mustashed train workers, but you actually get one with sunglasses.

Aside from minor flaws, this train is one of the best trains that Lego has made. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2006-09-20T14:48:53Z","Very nice set","This set offers a lot of loading and unloading possibilities. So you can transport everything to every part of your Lego world and fun does not disappear quickly! The locomotive looks nice, too, and the working light it has makes it even nicer! But I somehow believe that the locomotive would look better if it had doors. The waggons are also quite simple and nothing that requires elabortate building techniques. 

However, I still want to give it five points since the negative aspects I have mentioned are not so important anyway! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-07-29T12:42:05.847Z","5/5 king of the trains","this set is exactly the sort of thing that i expect from lego trains.  it has 3 cars, and one being longer than the other identical two.  the deisel engine is a must have because of its design and cababilities.  the sets price was reasonable at the time but is hard to get one nowadays.  it should have one more figure then the usuall three.  lego tends to mess figure quanities up from time to time.  the truck in the set is quite large and can hold the cargo compartments.  the road peice in this set is a little pointless but useful nonetheless. the set includes seven cargo compartments.  three are dumper carsw that be dumped to the side using six simple conector parts.  two are concrete mixers that are pretty cool but could use some touch ups.  the last two are my favorite and the first is a grey and yellow compartment with two carriers hooked with four red cilinders that to me resemble dynamite or fuel capsules.  the second and most cool out of the bunch is the blue tool compartment with six tools, and most cool, two blue pallet extenders.  now we get to the removable cranes and the scale.  the cranes are simple but have cool parts and one has a crane hook, and the other has a construstion grabber arm which can hold the peices of (dirt).  the scale is cool as well and works very well for me.  overall enough cannot be said about how cool this set is.  it's a must have for any lego fan, collector, or for that matter just plain anyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Night_City_Dream","2009-11-12T16:45:34.107Z","Best cargo train set","This is a huge set, and the train itself is huge and powerful-looking. It is very long for a town. I got it in the early 1996 and this is my only cargo train set which I think is the best one.

The set has an enormous number of pieces especially for the 90s. It includes a very massive locomotive (191 pieces), 3 cars one of which is very long, 7 containers of different style and type. What I like about this set is that there is a neat container-module system: each container-module can be placed anywhere be that a train wagon, the truck or the station, 7 modules in total.

I also like the design of the truck. It's not that long, but it is one of those rare 6-stud wide trucks and it and the truck from 4559 look very much alike.

The cargo station is very detailed in big in comparison with other cargo train sets. It has a road plate (old standrad!), 2 cranes one of which is a clamshell, a conveyer and a device measuring weight. All of them being very functional makes the set stand out among all the other sets that normally have a truck or a car and that's all.

The train is about 1 meter long!

However, there are some negative points:

1. No speed regulator, need to buy separately. I had to buy 4548 as well.
2. Too few minifigs for such a huge and playable set. Need at least 5: train driver, truck driver, conveyer surveyor, railway man, and a worker to perform some activity on the road.

Anyway, the set is great, and all the other cargo train sets can hardly compete with it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"boxobricks","2015-01-11T20:57:20.123Z","A very good cargo train","<p>I recently received&nbsp;set 4565 for Christmas and I could not be more satisfied with it.&nbsp;I completed the set the next day&nbsp;as I&nbsp;could not wait any longer to build this wonderful set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very sturdy and was designed for storage. The front flap lifts up to revile a plastic tray which&nbsp;shows off some of the specialty pieces included with the set. There is also an error on the box which shows two mustached &nbsp;train workers instead of one with a mustache and one with sunglasses.&nbsp;The back of the box and the last few pages of the instructions show&nbsp;alternate build ideas you can make with the set. This is something I&nbsp;wish Lego would still do today.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are lots of good parts in this set including a 9 volt motor, light prism, train wheels, hard to find red train bases, a road plate etc..&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get three minifigs with this set, two railroad workers and the train engineer.</p>

<p>The two train workers&nbsp;are identical except for there faces. As mentioned earlier one has a mustache and the other has the ever common black shades.</p>

<p>The engineer features a yellow jacket, a red hat and a mustache. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was for the most&nbsp;part straight forward although I did have to back track a couple of times&nbsp;(This was most likely due to the fact that I was still recovering from some sort of illness).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><strong>The locomotive: </strong>The locomotive was designed to look &nbsp;the same going both ways which it does. It also features working headlights and&nbsp;a nice cabin with a swiveling&nbsp;captain&#39;s seat and two control panels.</p>

<p><strong>The cars: </strong>You get three flat cars with this set which are pretty much the same as they are designed to be able&nbsp;to carry any of the included cargo&nbsp;pallets. The only difference between the three is that one uses the same&nbsp;longer train base as the locomotive and the other two use a shorter base..</p>

<p><strong>The cargo:&nbsp;</strong>All of the cargo pallets are the same size so that they can fit on any flat car and the included truck. There are two cement mixer pallets, three gravel pallets, a tool pallet and some other sort of pallet included.</p>

<p><strong>The truck: </strong>Personally I think the design of the truck looks a little strange. I believe this is because it is a six stud wide vehicle in a four stud wide vehicle era. The reason it is six studs wide is so that it can carry any of the pallets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Everything else: </strong>Other things included with the set are two cranes(one with a hook and the other with a claw), a working scale for the pallets, a drop off area for the included gravel or rocks and a road baseplate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this is a great set but it does have one big problem: it does not come with a speed regulator( the reason I&nbsp;had to give it a 4). Besides that factor this is a great set with plenty of playability. 4565 is a great looking cargo train and should definitely be on your&nbsp;list of sets to get.&nbsp;</p>
