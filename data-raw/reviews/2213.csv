"t_17","2008-01-02T20:15:46.607Z","Awesome","Great set! One of the best in this theme
I have all the other sets of this theme, (2001 only), and this is one of the best

Pros:
-includes a launcher
-goes far when you launch it
-great face
-when it hits a wall (or other object) the guy flys off
-launcher is kinda like a carry case
-cheap

Cons:
-guy falls off before he hits the wall sometimes
-the base of the car could be a better color
Not the best in this theme, but still awesome.

"Gus_263","2008-04-06T16:29:29.653Z","Gear","A set of the racers theme, released in 2001. This when beat the front the minifigure(don't playable, but with cool design and the only that can be putted in this car)flies out of the car. The car is only one piece, with another two compatible with any lego theme, that looks like be turbos or motor of the car and have symbols and characteristics of the minifigure, like the symbol showed in the box. These pieces are cool designed to be compatible with the device that makes the set run, also used as garage and with sticker of the stats of the car and the symbol. This isn't very useful, but is cool to play with and some pieces are compatible. One good thing is the price, cheap.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T15:15:48.78Z","Another classic Crash em' racer","As I write these reviews for these racers I think that LEGO made some very odd names for these people, but it is good. This Lego race car just like all the others was 3 dollars but this car has 8 pieces. I do not really prefer any of the racers because I like all of them. The age says 4-9 on the box for this racer but the age really does not matter except for choking hazards. I like these sets so I do consider them to you. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-08T09:56:49.627Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Gear Review","This is a very neat little car to have and it's also a good set to have for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms It's a simple built and very easy to maneuver. We also get a few stickers for the ramp. The only play features which is included in this set are the same as in the other LEGO Racers (Xalax) sets: The ramp is going to launch the vehicle and the gray bumper will shoot the driver out of the cockpit.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"BobaFett2","2010-09-30T23:36:57.663Z","Way too Expensive","Xalax, the first Racers subtheme (a successor to the Town Subtheme known as Race). The sets were released as McDonald's Promotions (except for the largest) as well as in stores. In McDonald's, the toy is practically free (if you get a kids meal you are probably getting a better value than buying in stores). The set is much too expensive and small.<br><h4>Parts and Price</h4>This set contains a few nice parts, and is saved from an awful rating by the purple. The base is nice, but is almost useless for anything BUT Xalax figures and there's not much to build on. The two other purple parts are really nice for MOCing, but on their own are pretty bad. The price is over-the-top, and not worth getting.<br><h4>Playability</h4>This set is nothing if not playable. The base has a cool function, where if one of the bumpers is hit the Xalax figure will go flying. There's also a cool box, which in addition to a storage container can be used to launch them forward (similarly to the Power Racers TECHNIC subtheme).<br><h4>Overall</h4><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Purple</li><li>Rare/Unique Parts</li><li>Box/Launcher</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Expensive (money or health)<br>Car is 3 parts!?!?</li><li>Crappy Base not useful for anything else</li></ul>Overall-this set is recommended for collectors or young children who like to play around a lot. If you really like purple parts for MOCs, I'd just suggest buying the parts separately.<br>",TRUE,3,3,1,5,1
