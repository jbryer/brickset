"t_17","2008-01-02T20:11:17.123Z","Good","Pretty good set, with few flaws
I have all the other sets of this theme, (2001 only), and this isn't as good as the others.

Pros:
-includes a launcher
-goes far when you launch it
-cool car
-when it hits a wall (or other object) the guy flys off
-launcher is kinda like a carry case
-cheap

Cons:
-guy is for some reason has a scared expression
-guy falls off before he hits the wall sometimes

This set is good, but not great.

The shape of the minifigure is different too, but only the shapes of this racers series can be throwned out of this car made with three pieces(two are in the front and back, looks like be turbos or a motor with symbols of this set. Were later used in racers sets like tiny turbos)a feature of these sets. Another thing are the colors, these makes the set be useful too, altogh with symbols, still cool. For a small and cheap set, this is great because have fun play with it but it's contents are few useful pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T15:04:31.373Z","Very unique!","These type of LEGO race cars throw the driver out of their seat if they collide into an object. I think this type of race car theme was called Crash em' racers. I got this along with most of the other racers in this type and it was only $3! I was very happy to find this for only $3 and it was worth it. It only has 8 pieces. Not much building to it but you have a blast of fun racing it afterwards.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-11-19T16:25:02.403Z","Great racer!","I got 2 of these when they first came out, and had hours of fun with them. They work very well, and the figures are VERY unique. Add to that they only cost $2.99, and you have a great deal! However, it's only available online now, so shipping will probably be greater than the cost...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-09T10:11:08.04Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Surfer Review","This is my second favourite LEGO Racers (Xalax) set and it's a fun set to build as well. This vehicle is very easy to maneuver and we also get a few stickers for the ramp. The play features are the same as in the other sets of the LEGO Racers (Xalax) theme: The ramp launches the car and the gray bumper will shoot the driver out of the cockpit. It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

There are not a lot of parts in the set; only 8 but once I got it built it looked really cool!<br><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Looks good once built<br></li><li>Includes launcher<br></li><li>Only $3<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Only 8 pieces<br></li><li>No traction on wheels <br></li></ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall I think this set is really cool and I suggest it to any lego fan.<br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
