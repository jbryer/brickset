The launcher is made of flimsy plastic and rubber bands. You slam down your hand onto it and the little car goes rolling across the floor. We have two so we can race them, the figure is a half block man that usually goes flying out once the car hits the wall or another object.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-09T10:05:40.467Z","For The Five Year Olds","I can honestly say as a collector I am ashamed to say I own this set. Firstly I only got it because it was on a clearance rack, because the box was busted and I didn't have one yet.

For a collector or builders point this set is useless. It has seven parts if you include the two rubber bands and the launching box. The base of the car is basically unusable in LEGO as such is the rear spoiler. The front piece is the only actually piece of LEGO and at the time as a child even I questioned that. The mini-fig is just a block  2x2 that looks like a purple jelly bean.

I realise when LEGO made this they were trying something new but it only appealed to five year olds and it failed. Thankfully they realised this mistake and changed racers as a series very quickly. As a collector it's useless worth nothing and gets a 0/10

Now as a child of say five this model is an alright LEGO model. Firstly it explodes, you can race them and being able to smash a toy and not get into trouble is fun. From a child's point they can be entertaining but I do feel they lack the endless possibilities of a normal model which we all experienced as children.

Overall looking at it from both perspectives this model gets my lowest rating to date 3/10 or 1/5 boarder lining a two. If it's free or like $1AU get it, if not dont waste your time or money, as a five year old or otherwise.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-06T16:38:11.357Z","Loopin","This is another small set of the racers, don't very useful because some pieces are different of other racers subthemes. Altough it, this is a cheap set, and good to play with, for five years old childrens or don't, because the designs, shapes, the box and the piece that can guards and in the same time launchs the car is well made, overall, all set is an option for cheap sets and competitions with other sets of the same subtheme, including too a sticker with fictional stats. This is a good set, the builting  is easy and have fun play with it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-07T10:22:51.407Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Loopin Review","This set may almost doesn't have any play features but it's a great set to have. It's a fun and easy built and we only get a few stickers for the ramp. The only play features we get are the same as in the other LEGO Racers (Xalax) sets: The ramp launches the car and the gray bumper will shoot the driver out of the cockpit. It's a very simple car to maneuver and it's also a good set for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
