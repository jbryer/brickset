I'll give this a 9, because when you race the car into the walls the piece with a wing back on the car will lose little of it's paint. And by the way, these cars are with in LEGO Racers 2.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-06T16:54:21.2Z","Warrior","This is another small and cool set due to the price. The contents are basically a piece that can throw the car with elastics and without these can be used like a &quot;garage&quot;. The car and minifigure are four pieces, two useful for any sets, the other two, features of the theme. The addition of the set is made with these two, the minifigure that can be throwed out of the car, never more included. To a cheap set, this is cool due to the fun that have in throw the car and makes the minifigure flies. The colors are too good painted,the red, purple and black makes a good color scheme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Yoda____","2008-10-31T17:29:33.39Z","fun(ny)","I got this set but because it is so similar to the other version with the only differnces being the character and colour scheme I might as well just copy the review that I did for the other one.

I remember this set when I was young(er) and it's actually pretty fun to play with. It only has about 4 pieces so I can't give it top marks but If you ram it into a wall or something then the figure (if you can call it that) pops out and goes flying.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-08T10:02:37.597Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Warrior Review","This set is very simple to build and very easy to maneuver as well. We also get a few stickers for the ramp. This set almost doesn't have any play features and the only features we get are the same as in the other sets of the LEGO Racers (Xalax) theme. This is a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"MattTheLegoman","2010-03-09T08:48:59.607Z","A new approach to an old set","<p>The set, when I bought it, was brilliant. Nowadays there is the more realistic and cooler mini-racers. But this car is so much more wackier than the new sets.</p><p>It was cheap enough in Australia to buy straight out of my minuscule pocket money, that was a massive plus for me. Over the period of six months I had collected the entire first series and was racing them with my family.</p><p>The design is very simple and not entirely ""LEGO-like"" - a few studs are there but the pieces are far to specialised to be used properly with my Moc'ing and LEGO wars...</p>Apart from the Warrior.<br><p>The crazy little guy definitely deserved a recognition for fitting into and piloting creations and sets that are to small for the standard mini-figure. For example - the new blue ATT, Warrior sits trigger-happy inside the main cockpit, while my LEGO wars rage around.</p><p>But the car chassis sits in a box of LEGO bricks I wish could be melted down and turned into something useful.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
