The colors are well painted, like the gray, blue and red details. Basically, this isn't very playable, but do the cars run and throw the minifigures is a good thing for competition of sets of the same theme. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-04T10:08:24.127Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Shredd Review","This set almost doesn't have any play features. The only play features we get is the same as in the other sets of the LEGO Racers (Xalax) theme: The ramp can be used to launch the car and the gray bumper shoots the driver out of the cockpit. The built is very simple and we also get a few stickers for the ramp to put on. This vehicle is very easy to maneuver and it's also a good set to have - even for pieces for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
