its kinda cool how he falls out when he hits omthing...but only kinda",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-06T17:11:28.327Z","Spiky","Another well made set, small and don't very useful, but still good for a cheap set. The useful things for any sets are the two pieces on back and in the front of the set, later used in racers theme. For this theme, the car, minifigure and the device to throw these makes a good competition if with all sets from this subtheme. The colors are cool too, makes a good color scheme and turn some pieces useful altough it have symbols. Stickers are also included, but they are optional for the garage of the car, but don't in the pieces, printed ones.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It isn't a genuine lego because it has different pieces, but it is very fun as a child to play with and makes a fun little toy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-04T10:02:25.54Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Spiky Review","This is one of the very first LEGO Racers sets which LEGO did and I think it's a good little set to have. As in every LEGO Racers (Xalax) set this set almost doesn't have any play features. The only play features we get is the same as in the other LEGO Racers (Xalax) sets: The ramp is going to launch the car and the gray bumper can push the driver out of the cockpit. This is a very simple build and we only get a few stickers for the ramp. This is a good little model to have - even for pieces which you can use for MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
