Additions in this are the different pieces and the useful ones. The useful were later used in racers subthemes like tiny turbos, but the others, like the minifigure(can be putted in lego system, but it isn't playable) and the car base, with the wheels and system to throw the minifigure out of it when beated, still cool if with more sets of this subtheme, making competition with these. A elastic is also included, useful to technic or sets with gear systems. Overall it is good for a cheap and small set, have fun when the car with the minifigure is launched and the minifigure flies out.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This set almost doesn't have any play features but the car is very easy to maneuver. The only play features we get is that the ramp which comes with this set is able to launch the car and the gray bumper allows you to push the driver out of the cockpit. The built is very easy and we also get a few stickers for the ramp. As I told you at the beginning: It's a cool little set to have. But I would still recommend you to get the bigger ones first.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
