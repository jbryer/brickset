"mrmitch","2007-06-06T03:41:53.2Z","Its a slammer type car without a mini figure","Pretty simple and cheap, you get this flimsy plastic launcher held togehter with rubber bands and you slam it and make the car go. Half a mans torso drives it and usually falls out once it hits the wall(kindy fun). I have two so we can race them across the kitchen floor. Best thing I can say is it is a LEGO set but one the quit making after a short while.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2007-08-05T19:18:43.787Z","Lets get this straight!","This set has five pieces (Including that launcher). the launcher is held together by rubber bands, and actually shoots that thing very fast. NEVER try slamming it into a wall because it will leave marks and this guy shoots off when you do it! good for a hotel!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"t_17","2008-01-02T20:22:20.11Z","So Cool","Awesome set, deffinately the best in this theme.

"Gus_263","2008-04-06T17:31:17.997Z","Lightor","This is one of my favorites because the colors are great. The red isn't very in this like in the set named &quot;warrior&quot;, but this have red in the minifigure and in the wheels, these connected with the car's base as one piece. The pieces are the same of the others, making the collection when completed be useful, more with the front and back parts of the cars. The other pieces, like the minifigure(in a spiked shape) is cool too, with the under part compatible with the car base, to flies when the car beats in a wall. Is includes too another piece, that can be used as garage of the car or with a elastic to launchs it. Stickers of this piece are also optional, but in the other pieces are printed. For a cheap set, it includes some good things, and is cool to play with the contents of the set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T15:11:09.153Z","The main Crash Em' Racer!","This was the main crash car that I thought was my favorite! Again it and all the other racers were $3 at my toy store and on the pictures for the crash em' racers it showed this one and the black one colliding against each other. I also did not mention that each car comes with it's own launcher. This launcher is yellow. Each Pack comes with stickers as well (a heads up to sticker haters). This particular racer has about 6 pieces. I think almost every racer is $3 and has 6 or more pieces. I do consider people buying this and other cars from the crash em' racers category.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-09T10:15:17.663Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Lightor Review","This set is my favourite set of the LEGO Racers (Xalax) theme and it's a great set to build as well. This vehicle is very easy to maneuver and we also get a few stickers for the ramp. The play feature we get is the same as in the other LEGO Racers (Xalax) sets: The ramp launches the car and the gray bumper will make the driver flying out of the cockpit.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

I found him complete in my storage box and thought (being such a fan of lego) ""why don't I look for him on the Internet?"" So I did He rams into a wall and the little monster pops out! Great fun although very simple.</p>
<p>The launcher, launches&nbsp;it very fast and left a mark on my wall trying it out! Overall good value for money and fun!</p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5
