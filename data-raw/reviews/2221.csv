Two printed pieces are useful, later used in other racers sets, and another useful thing is the minifigure(another red in a don't spiked shape), altough don't playable, can be used different in any lego system piece shape, or in the form of the set, compatible with the car that can be launched by a device, with elastics, or be guarded on it, (the same piece without elastics). The playability is basically makes the car run and when beated in a wall this makes the minifigure flies. If with the completed subtheme, is good make a competition with them. In comparision with themes of this size, this have innovations and is cool to play with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Cool &quot;Bump&quot; function
Neat MGs printed on back
Interesting box with stats for speed, traction, etc.
Drivers are fun to collect

Cons:
Discontinued


Honest to goodness, these little racers are amazing. My guess is that they'll be hard to find on Ebay.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-03T11:28:52.047Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Rip Review","This set is a quick and easy built but it's very easy to play with. We also get a few stickers which you need to put on the ramp and the car can be maneuvered very easily as well. This set almost doesn't have any play features. The only play features we get here are the same as in the other LEGO Racers (Xalax) sets: The ramp can launch the car and the gray bumber is able to shoot the driver out of the cockpit. It's a good little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
