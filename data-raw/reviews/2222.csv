With a cool car, a cool pilot included in a set with few pieces, if you search for it, it may cost a low price. These racers are excellent for competitions with all of the collection, because when something touches in the front the pilot go out of the car.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-07T10:26:59.12Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Pulse Review","This set is a good set to have. Even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms. It's an easy built and it's also very easy to maneuver this vehicle. We also get a few stickers for the ramp. The only play features we get in this set are the same as in the other LEGO Racers (Xalax) sets: The ramp launches the car and the gray bumper is able to shoot the driver out of the cockpit.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
