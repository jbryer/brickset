These pieces can represent motors or turbo systems of any car.  These racers sets, have few pieces, but, being compatible with various lego sets, it turns the set cool. I like the colors of duster, and it i rate 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-03T11:23:23.953Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Duster Review","This might be a small set but it's still lot's of fun to play with - even if this set almost doesn't have any play features. The built is very quick and easy and we also get a few stickers for the ramp. The play feature of this set is the same as in the other LEGO Racers (Xalax) sets: The ramp can be used to launch the car and the gray bumper makes the driver flying out of the cockpit. This car can be maneuvered very easily and it's also a good little model which you can use for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations) and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Squidtron","2009-12-21T21:39:11.937Z","Not much to say.","<h4>Build</h4>The build on this is fairly simple, just slap the bricks together and you're done!<br><h4>Minifigures</h4>The driver looks cool, but there's really not much you can do with him. He is not pose-able, he is essentially a monster/space alien form of the Drome Racer Mini-Pilot. <br><p><br></p><h4>Playability</h4>The real fun of this set comes once its assembled, playing with it is great! You can use the launcher to make it go, but I, unfortunately, lost it so I can't tell you anything about it. The&nbsp; ejecting feature is very fun. You can arange the car either so that when it hits something, the driver ejects, or when it's rear-ended the driver ejects. I had endless fun when I was younger running the car into things and watching the driver fly out.<br><br><h4>Parts</h4>The parts one this set are bulky and completely useless for MOCing. It only comes with for parts, and the only one that is interest is the driver. Like I mentioned above, he is similar to the Drome Racer pilots, in that the part is molded so that it is the driver sitting in a chair and clutching the steering wheel. Obviously, that's not very good for building with, and the fact that this car's driver is not human limits the possibilities even more.<br><br>Overall, this is a nice set if only for the play features. If you're only interested in MOCing, don't buy it. <br><br>",TRUE,3,1,1,4,3
