These green colors makes too a good scheme with the black parts. Altough this set have also a don't playable and different minifigure, is only this shape that can be launched of the vehicle. Two other pieces makes also the car, one in front other in back of this, like the ohers of the subtheme. These were later used in another racers sets, like tiny turbos. The piece on the back was designed to be the part that the device made with elastic and one big piece give impulse to the car run. The same device, can without the elastic be used as garage of the car with the minifigure. All pieces (except the big part that makes the device) are compatible, but the more useful are the elastic and the parts of front and back of the car. For a cheap set, this is cool to play with, altough have few pieces, have too innovations.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is by far the best Xalax racer, the paint job, the driver, and the few detailed pieces that make it so cool. I would definitely recommend this set to anyone who can find it or likes LEGO racers!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-11-01T11:07:23.59Z","LEGO Racers (Xalax) - Snake Review","Actually there's nothing much going on in this set. The set comes with a ramp which you can use to launch the small vehicle and on the vehicle you can push a gray bumper which you can use to shoot the driver out of the cockpit. This set is very simple to build and very easy to maneuver it. We also get a few stickers which you have to put on the ramp. It's a neat little set to have - even for pieces which you can use for brickfilms and/or MOC's (My own creations). But I would still recommend you to get the bigger sets first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
