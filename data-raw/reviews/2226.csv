It's fun to play with, and the trans-sky blue Rock Raiders Crystals are great for MoCers!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-07T14:02:02.483Z","Racers double set","This is the playset of these racers that can be launched out of the car if this beats the front. This set is bigger than the others, the others are only minifigure, car and it's launcher, this have also obstacles in the way of the cars, to make a better competition. To the competition grow, are included two cars with the minifigures, that have the name in the set's name, &quot;Freeze &amp; Chill&quot; these looks like have the same pieces of one to other, but have different minifigure's shape, one is spiked the other don't.  The obstacles of the set are a ramp, well made, and this is compatible with small racers set, being also tiny turbos. To go in the ramp, the cars need impulse, and a device included in other sets can do that. The cars can also be trapped in a net and falls into a pit, making the minifigure be launched out. If the car falls to outside of the pit, this can beat crystals, same of the aquazone and rock raiders theme. This set have colors to looks like with ice environment, like the light blue and white, or other colors, like the orange. This is an useful set to the racers sets and any lego theme, also to the subtheme of the same set, of the cars that launchs the minifigures. Is cool to play with and makes a great competition if wtih more sets of this theme. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
