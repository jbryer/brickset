"mrmitch","2007-06-06T03:51:33.763Z","Cool little set with pull back motor","You would be suprised how quick this little car is. Simple design variety of colors, due to the size of the car it doesn't have a full size mini figure. I have three different little pull back racers and we like to race them and drive the dog nuts chasing it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I remember trying to see who could get it to go further. Although the minifigure wasn't much, he had an awesome flame helmet, and there was that cool printed piece in the front. Three cheers for Tiny Turbos!",FALSE,4,3,3,5,5
