"deluckybrick","2007-07-16T18:32:39.92Z","Good for racing head-to-head","This is the first racer set I ever got, so I went and got a ton of them for a party. They were a hit among my friends! We raced them head to head along our hall. It was really fun, and that is what I reccomend using all the Racer products for, if you have friends or good siblings.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Quirrelthesquirrel","2009-09-15T07:08:08.153Z","Rough Terrain... No Probs!","<p>This is&nbsp;my favourite drome racer of the series.</p>
<p>The small man driving the Maverick Storm has great helmet design like other drome racer minifigures, a white head (Which is unique, considering most drome racer minifigures are not wearing a racing mask), and a cool red drome racers body!</p>
<p>The Maverick Storm itself is great too. It has a nice colour scheme, big chunky tyres and cool detail on the hood which depicts the number 3. The red and black studs below the hood (Which I'm guessing may be suspension) add nice detail to the car.</p>
<p>This racer would go well with the other drome racer <em>4582 Red Bullet. </em>Overall, a good set.</p>

with 1 minifig and 31 pieces. This set does include no decals and 
there're no mistakes in the instructions and no missing pieces.<br><br><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/4583-1.jpg[/img]</span><br><br><span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigures:</span><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><br></span><span><span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Driver:</span></span>
 The driver is not a real minifig. The minifig just got a kind of stand with a steering wheel on the red stand. On the top of the stand is the head with the white mask and the green helmet with a flame on the top. The visor is movable.<br><br></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Maverick Storm:</span><br><br>The race car for Maverick Storm is very easy to build. On the front you can see the coil springs and on the top you get a piece which has a number 3 on it. Then you have a place to put in the minifig and the engine on the back. The aluminum rims are printed green. <span><span>The pull back motor does really work and the car is driving very fast.<br><br></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ideas:</span></span><br><br>This set has 2 ideas on the back of the instruction which you can build with the pieces of this set. There're no instructions for these ideas but I've taken pictures for them which you can see on my website. Here're the 2 ideas:<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Positive:</span><br><br>Great pieces which you can youse for brickfilms or MOC's<br>Nice starter set<br>No stickers<br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Negative:</span><br><br>Not so many play features<br>Too easy to build<br>Minifigure looks weird<br><br>All
in all it's a great set to get and I would highly recommend you to get
this model. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"frycook49","2011-03-02T01:54:10.957Z","Nice!","This is a nice little set. The 'mini-figure' (Not sure how to describe it) is not bad either. It's fun to race with other racers, but newer racer sets won't combine as well with it. The parts included aren't bad either. It's not the greatest set, but&nbsp;certainly is a very nice set.&nbsp;",FALSE,3,3,2,4,3
