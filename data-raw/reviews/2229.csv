The kids and myself love the pull back motor cars LEGO has come out with. The work real well on smooth floors and will go quite a ways 25+ feet. We have a few of them so we can race. A fun set fairly easy to build and fun to play around with them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-04-02T16:17:31.39Z","Great racer!","I got this set clearenced years ago. I say this set is good and fairly simple to rate. First of all it has a pull back motor. Second it comes with a rare fig. Third it has a sturdy design. Last goes far and runs very smooth as stated before.
Pro: minifig

design sturdy

pull back motor

smooth and goes far

Cons: back tips come off if you play it.(not bad)

Overall this set is about a 9.0/10.0 because you need another racer or other sets to have real fun with it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-25T15:10:43.653Z","Hot Scorcher"," This is a small set of the racers theme. Released in the year of 2003, this wasn't so much cheap for the size, but it is nice, and isn't expensive. 
 The orange color schemes and some yellow details, makes this a good designed car in the Lego Racers style. More like a race car, this features some bricks with shapes to make it really looks like a car for races. 
 And the red plate, under all the set, fit well the other bricks and connects the wheels (these are in a good size for it, because these roll well and are simple, but nice designed too), making it still intact when playing, but also simple.
 Above some few plates, are the two triangular yellow plates, on each side of the car, and on the sides of the cockpit. The pilot stay on it with no problem, and the plates are increased by some other few bricks, but these don't makes any change to the position of the pilot and the cockpit. 
 On the back, made by some more orange and red bricks, there is a long back spoiler increasing the chassis, and also on the back of the cockpit.
 In a good position, the pilot stay in a level under some plates, and like in some cars of races, it stay in a position that combined with some aerodinamic, don't have doors. Altough don't have doors, this car still good for &quot;races&quot; with more Lego cars. 
 On the front, there are more plates making the chassis, increased by some orange bricks in different shapes, with some printed details.
 The minifigure included is a racer, with an orange uniform, with simple details, and it also includes a red helmet with a transparent visor. The face of the pilot was too included with some ninja sets, and altough simple, it is cool.
 The playability is basic, the common playability of a Lego racers car, with this size. Altough small, this can be increased or increase other more cars.
 In comparison with some other cars of the racers theme, it still good, and also in price, but it is now, another racers set hard to find. 
 Overall, a good small set with some of the racers stuff. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Stud_Sensei","2022-01-13T15:12:38.353Z","Lame Name, Great Ride","<p><em>Drome Racers&nbsp;</em>represented the best of LEGO&#39;s attempts at creating a line of its own designs under the&nbsp;<em>Racers</em>&nbsp;banner. Accompanied by an excellent online game, the range boasted&nbsp;sets spanning&nbsp;System and Technic, pocket-money and Christmas gift prices, and every form of racing vehicle under the sun. The range saw vehicles rendered in unique and unusual ways, blending exaggerated (verging on sci-fi) designs with dramatic curves, proportions and dynamics with more grounded vehicle types such as dragsters, track racers and monster trucks.</p>

<p><em>4584 - Hot Scorcher,</em>&nbsp;as it appears on the box, bears a passing resemblance to an F1 car that is most apparent when sat next to&nbsp;<em>8374 - Williams F1 Team Racer</em>, with its long&nbsp;nose, sidepods and exposed front axles. In reality though, it&#39;s distinctly fantastical, with no front wing and a completely flat rear wing. It&#39;s also more substantial looking than a&nbsp;skeletal F1 car, too, and has a cab further forward than you&#39;d expect on a F1 car -&nbsp;this is no bad thing, as the end product looks the part, squat and low, streamlined but aggressive. Although LEGO has long since improved the accuracy of their true F1 models,&nbsp;<em>4584</em>&#39;s stylised take still impresses.</p>

<p>This set is definitely more &#39;play&#39; than &#39;display&#39;, given its pullback motor, but the bulky element is incorporated well and disappears into the finished model. The pullback system works well and can send this thing at some impressive speeds a good distance - more than enough to entertain the younger ones.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a decent array of parts here, too; a few race inspired printed parts and a versatile 4x9 black wedge, though it&#39;s a shame the wing is so simple and fixed in place, a hinged positionable design would&#39;ve scored extra points. The driver fig - Scorcher, if Bricklink is anything to go by - is also a nice design, with a nicely detailed race-suit and a face print lifted from the&nbsp;<em>Ninja&nbsp;</em>theme and employed to good effect in capturing that race focus.</p>

<p>Although its box wasn&#39;t overflowing with parts, for its &pound;7.99 retail back in the day, <em>4584</em>&nbsp;was a solid, substantial set, something harder to come by these days at that price point. Although serious builders might baulk at its simplicity, this model definitely makes a solid entry in a collection, and one worth picking up should the opportunity arise.</p>
