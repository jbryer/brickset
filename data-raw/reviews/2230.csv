If you run it into something you will be repairing this car. Its the best of the three big pull back cars I own that will actually work across carpet - due to the big tires. A fun set worth having.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-07-23T17:13:09.94Z","Odd, maybe I built mine wrong...","I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about, my Pulverizer was the sturdiest car I had.  I could drop it, run it into a wall, or force it to do some fairly dangerous jumps (if attempted with real people), and it wouldnt break.
Hmmmmm...
The car has a fairly good design, and very cool wheels!  I agree with the other review, this car can actually go over carpet!  Its engine was way better than any other cars that I own, and it always beat the other cars in races.
A very well made car, deserves a eight and one-half! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-17T23:41:49.03Z","mine is not &quot;flimsey&quot;","this set rocks. it stays together fine, it can run into things and take jumps, i sent mine down the stairs and all that came off was the windshield. this set is great i've taken my motor off and built other cool things. this is probably the strongest wind up motor they have. i would definitly recomend this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I got it a few years ago, and was really excited to have such big wheels (considering how small/inexpensive the set is).<br><br>The window is good---a bit steep, but OK for some MOCs.<br><br>The minifig was good (I really like the face), except for the arms. Would've made 'em blue.<br><br>NO STICKERS! Horay!<br><br>It had some great light-blue pieces---great accent color for a MOC Jedi Starfighter.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Lego_Lord_Mayorca","2010-10-15T13:33:13.953Z","Lego RACE Lives on with the ""Nitro Pulverizer""","<p>I thought my racing days were long over. By 2002, it seemed obvious that my Lego dollars would be spent only on Star Wars and the newly-captivating BIONICLE sets, and unless there were any really awesome re-releases in the Lego LEGENDS line, I didn't foresee myself venturing into the more exotic themes like ""Alpha Team"" or ""Jack Stone"" (blech). However in late 2001, around Christmastime, I found myself looking at the Nitro Pulverizer on the shelf in Wal-Mart and thinking, ""Whoa. Cool car!"" I knew I had to have it.</p><p><br></p><p style="""">The last substantial Lego race car I got was the huge RC car from several years prior, so it was a bit of a thrill opening a ""small"" Lego race car, the first since my Mud Runner and Race 3-in-1 Value Pack days. The parts selection I was presented with was quite awesome. I marveled at the new windshield and the light-blue wedge plates, which, unbeknown to me at the time, would become staples of future Star Wars sets. The big balloon tires were also quite cool, as they really gave a ""destructive"" feel to the set, appropriate considering its name.</p><p style=""""><br></p><p style="""">Building went by rather quickly due to the bulk of the chassis being the pull-back motor piece. This dismayed me somewhat, but the nice integration of Technic with System construction in the front half of the vehicle impressed me, as well as the addition of an actual engine block in the back of the truck. All in all, it was over rather quickly, which wasn't such a bad thing.</p><p style=""""><br></p><p style="""">This set was definitely made for racing! I had doubts about the usefulness of the pull-back motor, but its power and ease of use soon cast such thoughts from my mind. Clearly, while this was not a car that could easily navigate the roadplates of Lego town, it didn't belong there. This monster was made for the badlands, the rough, junk-strewn wilderness of Lego parts lying on the floor beyond the fair domains of the Pizza-to-Go and Police HQ. The gritty look of the driver complemented this; his countenance and physical appearance even was a modern upgrade of the look of the driver in my beloved 6510 Mud Runner. <br></p><p style=""""><br></p><p style="""">Unfortunately, I never picked up any more of this particular sub-theme. But let that not discredit the Nitro-P, a wonderful set that came out in a great year full of wonderful sets. Its inclusion in my collection in spite of this speaks volumes as to how worthy it is to any collector of Lego race vehicles. <br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
