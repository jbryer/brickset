"WiseWarrior","2008-10-31T19:24:21.153Z","A big disappointment","While I must admit that it looks cool, the actual performance of it is anything but. You can rarely get it to work, and 50 dollars for looks does not do it for me. If it worked better it would be an awesome set, but sadly it does not.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"gome4","2009-08-28T13:47:43.06Z","alright","this is a mega disappointment, it doesnt work properly. first off its not side by side racing, so the one that wins is the one you release first

"LegoLove","2010-11-17T05:16:53.79Z","A marvellous racetrack","<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>The start-mechanism 
<li>A kind of a seesaw after the start 
<li>The bridge 
<li>The big bend 
<li>The ramp - the car jumps up to ten cm 
<li>The apparatus at the end with the rising chequered flag</li></ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lego should have added more tricky pieces or passages&nbsp;to the track&nbsp;- there only three of them - and more track pieces for the price of 50 â‚¬ (at the time when I got it)</li></ul>
<p>All in all a very cool set - I combined it with set 4586 and had a lot of fun with it!</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
