What can I say, well its free &amp; its got a pull back &amp; go motor.
Motor seems quite fast &amp; goes a long way when used in this set, but lego should really have changed the gearing to go a shorter distance, (after all why bother making it go much further than the length of a room,) but pull more weight.  If you try to use the motor in a minifig scale car, its not up to the job of powering it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-07-23T17:55:05.33Z","Good car.","This set I bought at the Lego store in Disney World, for about $4, and it has no racing flaws.  The only thing you can complain about is that it has those afterburners on the back, that tend to fall off.  It also races well against all my other racers, and I think it can also hold full-sized minifigs just fine.  Also, a good color scheme.

"Blade","2007-08-28T11:33:18.223Z","Star Burst?","My first point on this model is the name. Is it star strike or star burst because my instruction book says Burst. Anyway this model is cool. The blue, grey colour scheme is really nice with a bit of ink on a couple of pieces NO STICKERS. The turbo jets at the back are nice and I haven't had any problems with them.

The mini-fig is a let down. It's got one of those stupid one piece block bodies, with a  head and helmet stuck on top. The face is pretty average. There are better in the Racers series.

Now the real point i would like to make in this series is the motor. This is a sweet little gizmo and gets full marks from me if it can stand the test of time and children. This motor is a level 2 motor which as defined by the LEGO catalogue of 2002 Jan - July page 53 states &quot; Super strong and fast motor.&quot; Each motor is designed for a different thing and that is what this one is meant to be.

Overall its a great little model and deservers an 8/10 only because its so small, cheap and the motor is a nice addition. Lost points for the model but what can you do? I would recommend this model to any collector, town or racer lover.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jonbuddy","2009-07-18T13:43:20.89Z","A tiny Pull-Back motor racer. (4591)","This set was much more weird than 4590: Flash Turbo. The goggles on the guys face are just plain crazy-looking :O. The overall racing part of it is cool. As I have mentioned in the Flash Turbo review, you should get both of these to have a evenly matched race.

"Quirrelthesquirrel","2009-09-15T07:12:52.623Z","What kind of Star Burst? Snakes? Jelly Babies?","<p>This was my second drome racer, and one of my least favourites. </p>
<p>The small man driving the Star Burst/Star Strike has great helmet detail, a unique head and a black drome racers body piece!</p>
<p>The Star Burst/Star Strike has a good colour combination and nice detail on the front and back. It&nbsp;also has two different wheel types, which can be unusual for a drome racer and the flame boosters on the back are a nice detail.</p>
<p>The Pull-back function in this set works well like the other drome racers, and goes great with <em>4590 Flash Turbo</em>, and <em>4592 Red Monster.</em> Overall, a good little set</p>

"Stud_Sensei","2021-05-25T17:32:29.7Z","The Lost Art of <Â£3 Collectible Playsets","<p>Star Strike (or Star Burst, as the instructions confusingly declares) was one of the few pull-back racers I wasn&#39;t able to get my hands on as a kid, back when they were on the shelves, but I was recently lucky enough to grab a sealed one for retail price on a whim.</p>

<p>There&#39;s not a lot to discuss about this set, given that it only has 28 pieces and one (extremely) mini figure. The pull back function is a lot of fun for young kids, though it rarely wants to go dead straight on these small models, and the build is easy enough to do blindfolded with one hand. The driver figure is bizarre, though makes sense as a choice to keep the model as small as possible, while still incorporating the bulky pull-back motor unit. You won&#39;t find them anywhere else for a good reason though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the model does include some unique and nicely printed pieces to make it stand out a bit more, which are easily interchangeable with the details on other mini pull-backs, and the box shows off some interesting alt-builds, so there&#39;s some additional playability to be had there.</p>

<p>It&#39;d be hard to recommend this, or any of the mini pull-back racers, to an AFOL looking for a challenging build or a striking end model, but at the current market prices these could make a good nostalgic purchase or a gift for young relatives. In spite of this, I still miss when small models such as these were still on the shelves - boxed sets that could be purchased for the same price collectible figures now command, but offering far more playability and similar excitement to unboxing any larger set. Polybags just don&#39;t scratch that same itch!</p>
