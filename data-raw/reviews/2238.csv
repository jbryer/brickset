The only problem is that occasionally, the cars dont race at even speeds, so it deserves a 8.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

1. Spoilers are unstable!
2. They're not really minifigs, just heads on a weird driver piece, and that really bothered me.
But it's playability is great, and I guess the driver thing is a matter of opinion.
But since they stopped making it, I find no point on going on ebay to get it. Save your cash.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
