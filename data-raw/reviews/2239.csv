Pros:
Cool paint for the cars.
Two cars, so start your engines!

Cons:
The ramp is included, but the cars wont jump.

This set gets an 8 because the cars cant jump.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"gryphon","2010-02-05T13:53:11.763Z","Fragile Go-Karts","I think, I've got this set as a present in 2002 or 2003. It is really nasty and the pullback motors aren't that strong. Both cars are build similar and have the same motor. But I think, one of them is a little stronger. The ramp is weak and  has only a 2x2-feet with a round plate with a roundes bottom (2654 on bricklink).

The ""minifigs"" have only a big head and a really minuscule body. That doesn't make sense and looks really bad. The small bodies are probably the worst part of this set.
Pro:
Useful wheels

Contra:
Bodies are too small
Poor motors
Fragile cars",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
