<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Bandit fig.<br></li><li>The only Rock Raiders promotional that has wheels.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The vehicle is a bit small. <br></li><li>The sweets were made in 2000. Hmm.</li><li>Bandit has no chair so he can fall off the back of the bulldozer.<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall, it probably would be worth it to buy the pieces bulk. Apart from that it's a pretty good set.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,2
