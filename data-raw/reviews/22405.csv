Still these are mostly impulse buys and unless you're really into the Friends line you can easily skip them.</p>
<p>Let's discuss now the pros and cons of this foil packed set.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Green parrot instead of yellow, this is the same bird we've seen in a few LEGO Friends sets only the colouring is new, which is a great improvement. I like the yellow one just fine, but this green one really stands out in my eyes. 
<li>There are two builds in this pack, one of them is the birdhouse and the other is a small feeding station. Both are fairly simple builds and really quite fun looking, although I feel that the birdhouse is a bit tall when placed next to Mini-Dolls and Mini-Figures. 
<li>Some nice pieces in this set, not a lot of rare colours to be found but all very useful.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The bows as always look goofy when worn by the animals, it's really the only problem I see with this set and it's a very minor one. I should also point out that one part of the instruction manual is a bit off, because the piece shown and the actual piece that comes in the set are not exactly the same thing. In the manual, instead of the 1x4&nbsp;fence piece with 4 bars it shows a 1x4 fence piece with 2 bars only. Perhaps at one point this piece was to be used instead and the instructions just weren't changed? Who can say.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I think Series 3 of the Animals have a good value for what you get, this one in particular stands out to me as the best build though I still prefer Fawn's Forest as the best animal piece. Recommended for fans of the Friends line who enjoy the animals a lot.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
