"Yoda____","2008-10-29T16:17:06.39Z","I hate those minfigures","Well who doesn't (reference to title) but other than that it isn't that bad. It has a couple  of cool accesories and for young people who aren't very good with lego then it is a great and easy way to strt building a lego car. To be honest it isn't that bad but why are the minifigures so tall, it doesn't make sense. It means that they don't go well with any other theme. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

 set (4600) is a LEGO Jack Stone set which came out in 2001. It comes
with 1 minifig and 22 pieces. This set does include no decals and 
there're no mistakes in the instructions and no missing pieces. <br><br><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/4600-1.jpg[/img]</span><br><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minifigure:</span><br><br><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Cop:</span>

this model. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>At least some useful parts (stop sign, barrier, walkie-talkie).<br></li><li>Er...khrm...so...um...er...NOTHING ELSE!<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Horrible, unplayable minifig. Ugly uniform, nasty nose, and he can't move his hands!<br></li><li>Juniorized, useless parts.</li><li>We get just 22 parts. How shameful!<br></li><li>Odd-looking and senseless 'car'. No top, no details, just an awful vehicle with ridiculously big wheels and horrible windscreen. And a spoiler! Yes, that's very important! (WARNING: ironical content!)</li><li>Big orange siren part (?!).</li><li>Too big and strange steering wheel.</li><li>The whole 'set' is as unplayable as a Jack Stone set usually.<br></li></ul>
<p>In conclusion...well, I think you know...BAD BREAK!<br></p>",TRUE,1,2,1,1,1
