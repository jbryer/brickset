Its a vehicle that rolls well and has the cool blue flame. All of the Jack Stone line and the 4+ series have figures that are 2&quot; tall not the standard 1 1/2&quot; tall. Almost all of the J Stone sets we have were bought on clearance here and there. Not a bad set if you are pleasing a child in the age group listed above.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It still has the same flaw and advantage that i've said so many times i'm not even going to bother to type again. This one is probably the worst Jack Stone set I have.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BobaFett2","2011-01-19T12:48:44.01Z","I think a 4 year old should be able to build...","<p>As with all of the Jack Stone sets, this is overprice, overjuniorized, and not so well designed. I really don't see how a 4-year old shouldn't be able to build. Or a 7 year old.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It shows the cruiser driving down a street with cartoony buildings in the background. Nice setup. There's a neat little comic on the <a href=""http://peeron.com/scans/4601-1/2/"">last page</a>.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The best part here is the front piece. It's a printed 3x4 slope. Very nice. There's two printed TECHNIC pieces, as well as a water piece. Other parts are pretty inconsequential.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get a large Fire Chief. It can't be taken apart-while nicely designed, it's too large to be useful (takes up too much space) in small vehicles and just not worth that much.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's dull. They can fit it into less than <a href=""http://peeron.com/scans/4601-1/1"">one page</a>.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Nothing more than dull. It's not very well designed. I don't know how this sold.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I still hate this theme. It's nearly useless for parts, has annoying figures, and no build whatsoever. And it taught kids that you could make ""good"" buildings by sticking together beams and placing these odd parts in them, and ""good"" cars by just sticking on attachments.<br></p>",TRUE,1,1,1,2,1
