"BobaFett2","2011-01-20T11:51:32.33Z","One of the best Jack Stone sets-but still, not that much","<p>Of all the Jack Stone sets, this is probably one of the best. The sole reason is for it's parts.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The Res-Q Wrecker is displayed with cartoony mountains as a background. Simple and boring.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set costs 20 cents per part-not a good price. However, it has quite a few nice parts-such as the windscreen, chain, ball hook, and race car back. However, the parts are over-juniorized.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Minifigure is detailed and has texture, but unfortunately, it's pretty bad. It's too big and the hands don't rotate, and it is simply out of place in a LEGO world.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>There's really nothing. It's better than in some sets of the theme, but it's really nothing.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks good, but it's not actually that great. It is functional, with a tow arm, (how is this a wrecker?), and bumper, but the large parts' aesthetics just aren't that good.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is probably the most worthwhile Jack Stone set to get. It's not very good, but it has quite a few nice parts. Still....it's over juniorized with nearly no build whatsoever, has a large figure that's more of a doll than a Minifigure (doesn't come apart, can only hold accessories), and doesn't fit the name.<br></p>",TRUE,2,3,1,2,1
