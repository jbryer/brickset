"Alemas","2009-05-19T16:49:37.153Z","""Can do, will do!"" - Jack Stone's catchphrase. Oh the cheesiness! :P","<p>Edit on 1 November 2011: I am refreshing my old reviews with some better wording and new brick ratings.</p><p>This is part of the much-hated Jack Stone theme. It was aimed at 4-year-olds, which may explain the so-called ""maxifigs"". The problem was that they may have been popular with its target audience, but they were pretty much hated by everyone else for the ultra-juniorised pieces and maxifigs.</p><p>Now, onto the set itself. This 'copter has 14 pieces. For £5.99? RIDICOLOUS! :P At least it has a chrome exhaust and a printed tail. But that's pretty much it. :P The rest of the pieces are huge and unusable, except for the 2 x 6 brick, and tail rotor. Not even the winch is great, as it requires two pin slots. Let's not even talk about the maxifigs; they are huge one-piece monsters. :P<br></p>

They ended up gathering dust on my window sill...<div><br></div><div>I burnt the Jack Stone figure from this set. The Helicopter Pilot Girl is UGLY!

"modena","2010-12-12T12:27:23.987Z","Winch the rotor back up when it's broken.","This was a nice set, for a little boy. I still enjoy this set, mostly because of it's winch.<h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Winch!</li><li>The winch can hold a lot&nbsp;of weight!</li><li>Walkie-talkies included!</li><li>Camera included!</li><li>Easy to rebuild!</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div><ul><li>Blades fall off easily.</li><li>Very easy to build.</li><li>Winch&nbsp;can't&nbsp;hold weight.</li><li>Big minifigures.</li></ul></div><h4>Overall:</h4><p>This was a satisfactory set. However, it's best part is the winch. Th rotor blades fall off easily, which is sad. The minifigures are also so childish, and you can't rotate their hands!</p><p>Overall, get this set for the winch, if you want it.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,3
"tisi","2012-11-04T11:19:27.883Z","*SIGH* Another Jack Stone set...","<p>I hate Jack Stone, it's a fact. But I own some because I got some as a child. Probably this is the worst set ever if we don't mind Galidor and Mc Donald's promos.&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I don't own the box, but I have the instructions. It is a small folded paper with one single picture. This is the manual. There is a strange comic on it: Jack Stone and an ugly policewoman travel by the helicopter, but it breaks. Artlessly, Jack has a great idea: build a snowmobile! What a shame...<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>14 (!) parts? What the hell? There is no one on our tiny planet who can make a good minifig-size helicopter out of 14 pieces! And all of them are those ugly, nasty, juniorized Jack Stone parts! (OK, the camera is useful.) I give one brick, because it's the lowest rating.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>It consists of two minifigs: Jack Stone and the pilot. Small problem: Jack Stone hasn't got helmet. Big problems: nose, ugly face, unmoveable hands, too big size, hideous uniform and so on. Useless, unplayable, nasty minifigures.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>~2 minutes. Nothing interesting there.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Awful design, awful looking, no details, the whole 'helicopter' is a shame. The propeller is unsightly. The windscreen is terrible. I can't have even a good word about it. Unpardonable bad break.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I just want to see the guy who permitted this monster. Maybe he was drunk. But I hope it was just the nightmare of 2003 and we don't have to see similar 'sets' in the future.</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English grammar :D<br></p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
