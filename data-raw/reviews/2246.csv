Okay, this set has its high points like the fire extinguisher. Like the police &quot;cruiser&quot; I still hate the minifigures but I still think that it's good for people who aren't good with lego and need help building good cars.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I can't remember to the box, but I own the instructions. Very small sheet of paper with a strange comic where our hero rebuilds the 'SUV' to another vehicle which has enough place for two Jack Stone-style minifigs. <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>28 pieces isn't enough for a real fire response SUV. But Jack Stone did it with the unbelievably ugly juniorized parts. The water part is good, all the other ones are horribly unrealistic.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>We get 2 of them: Jack Stone, the sheik, and a fireman in a very ugly uniform. The biggest problem is with their nose (why are those there?) and their hand (you can move their arms, but you can't move their hand itself). And they reminds me to Galidor, the other worst theme of TLG.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Not more than one minute. You don't even need the instructions for it.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I can't have even a good word about it.  The 2x2 round brick, which is called 'siren' in that case is ugly, just like the silly-built box-like something on the back.The windscreen is hideous, and there are some paintings on it! It's even increases its deformity! The six (!) giant wheels are unsightly and ugly! <br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Maybe TLG wanted to make a set which is easy to build for kids. It's OK, but why made they it so ugly? It's nasty, unplayable, horribly unrealistic and overpriced! The only good point is the water piece, which is rare and useful, but it's only one part out of the shameful 28! So don't buy it, forget Jack Stone immediately! It was a bad break, dear TLG!</p><p>Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English grammar :D.<br></p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
