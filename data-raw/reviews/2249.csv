You do get two unique ATM type machines with dollars to put inside them. The jail bars will slide up along a grove in the blocks, which is kinda neat. Good set if your young one is into Jack Stone.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-12-16T20:14:56.293Z","Getting There","Lego was trying to get the 5 and under crowd with this set, but it isn't that good. The cash registers are too big and useless for minifigures. As always, the cars in this theme aren't that great either, but there's money! Lego tried on this one but fell short.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2011-07-13T13:00:56.607Z","Good Introductory Set","It is almost universally known to FOL's (Fans of LEGO) that Jack Stone and Galidor are some of LEGO's most derided themes. Jack Stone, in the time the theme was sold, was primarily marketed to children 4-6 and were of little use to others, except the aforementioned age range. Now while this set only solidifies those beliefs, it raises some interesting points- this is one of the few LEGO bank sets and does feature some interesting pieces.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Building Experience</span>: If you're truly looking for an ""experience"", this is most definitely not the set for you. If fast and easy play is your child's sort of thing, this may be enjoyable. If your child enjoys a challenge, you may want to go to LEGO System sets.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Parts</span>: This category of the set does get bumped up a bit, mainly because there are, contrary to popular belief, parts of some value in this set. However, I must first rant about some pieces. The minifigures (if you can call them that) appear to be on steroids, and in contrast to normal figures, simply don't look right. The other big parts are somewhat acceptable, yet still look awkward in system building. However, this set does come with some decent pieces. There are a number of printed dollar bills, a printed bank sign, printed cash registers, and some nice crates. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Playability: </span>Children of a young age will certainly have fun with this set. A car chase, a bank robbery, and a lock-up in the police car will make for an interesting time with this set. Its limited functions, however, do detract. If your child has a fond imagination, however, they will ignore these faults.&nbsp; <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Value for Money</span>: Note that I am not grading this on its market price, as it was an outrageous amount for this little set. I picked this set up a long time ago at perhaps 8 or 9 dollars. A fair amount, indeed, and you can find this set on bricklink for a much less nowadays. <br><br>Final Thoughts: This set is of little use to hardcore LEGO fans (besides the semi-useful pieces), but If you're trying to introduce a young child to LEGO, this is a wonderful idea. <br>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,4
"AETerry","2010-10-30T17:40:05.317Z","E-Bay Buy","To start with, I don't like the minifigures of the Jack Stone series. I plan to give these away at some later point.... and I have indeed given this set to my daughter's Preschool minus the special printed pieces of Bank Sign, Money and&nbsp;Computer ATM&nbsp;pieces.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>I also didn't care for the vehicles... too simple in my tastes. This is probably meant to appeal to a younger audience.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>My slanted tile for the ATM machine, one of them was blank, I don't know if that was the seller putting in a random piece to fill out a missing piece or if that was a problem of LEGO's.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>The other reason I got this was for the money pieces/tiles. Beyond that, if Jack Stone or this size and brand of minifigure sets were to come back, as an AFOL, I won't be buying any of them.",TRUE,2,3,2,2,2
