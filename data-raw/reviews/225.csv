"Rgijaba","2008-08-27T20:56:58.67Z","an odd little craft.","the helidopter transport was one of the four little sets pagaged with Kabaya sweets. i got this one in a combo pack! it has some nice pieces, the small brown helicopter blade, the darck turquise grills, the dark grey platform and slope with the Rock Raiders yellow and black stripe pattern, and the the minifigure of Docs the geoligest.as for the ship provided, it doesn't look very arodiamec, and rather cluncky.i suppose you could build the little other ship pitured on the ploybag, but i didn't. i just left this little set as-is. not too good on its own, but i would still get itif i was you. if you could find it. it is a great parts pack!
