<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I have the box at the moment because I can store my smaller boxes and instructions in it. On the back, there is a 4-years-old kid who is playing with that 'set'. On a smaller picture, it advertises that if you throw the vehicle to the ground it doesn't break. (Of course it doesn't. It contains ~a dozen parts only.) And there are even uglier alternate models. The instructions are on a folded paper and those are very simplified. You can see a comic on it too, where our sheik, Jack Stone saves a poor guy who stacked on the top of a building-like object. He rebuilds the frumpy fire truck to a frumpy fire truck with higher ladders. Interesting.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>90 pieces? Are you kidding me? 4436 (the forest police car) contains even more pieces! What a shame! Yes, yes, I gave two points, but just because some useful pieces, for example the rare fire and water elements, the dollar bill, the cool but big wrench, the rare control panel, the 'Octan'-logo and so on. Yes, those are useful. But I can't imagine that awkward juniorized vehicle-elements on a good-looking vehicle! Giant wheels, disfigured sirens and a spoiler. Wait...a spoiler? On a fire truck? How shameful!<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>We get three of them: Jack Stone with his ugly clothes, and two fireman with their strange-looking uniform. The minifigs' main problems are: the noses (why are those there?), the hand what doesn't rotate (but the arm does!) and the tallness (they don't fit to any other LEGO sets). <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It doesn't take more than 5 minutes-of course it doesn't, because of the horrible juniorized parts!<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I can typify it with a single word: TERRIBLE! Yes, you can play with it, until you don't get sickness. The vehicle itself is just ugly! The building doesn't make sense! The silly waterbox, the nasty windscreen, the hideous columns...arrgh!<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The only positive things about the set are the rare pieces and the low playability. But all the other things - the minifigs, the design, the 'models', the stupid juniorization - are horrible! If TLG wants to make an instant-build set, they have to design it normally, because it's unsightly in almost everywhere! Jack Stone was a very bad break!</p><p>Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English grammar :D.<br></p>",TRUE,1,2,1,2,1
