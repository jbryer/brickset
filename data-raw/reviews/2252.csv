"Mr_Dunlop","2008-12-18T06:54:04.967Z","A set of raw potential","I got this set not long after it came out. I was pretty into the Jack Stone series at the time and remember having had plans to combine it with 4620 to create a super-sized air traffic control centre (considering I also got 4619), but I never ended up getting 4260. I imagine if I had have, I might be more fond of this set, but then again, that would've made this review biased, so it might not have been a terrible shame in the end, hey?

Anyway, this set, I can say from experience, will entertain a Lego-lover of its target age group. They is the obvious ability for them to have chases with the police car and the roadster, which is added to by the fact that the police car omits both flashing lights and a siren sound by the press of a button on the left hand side (which can't be seen in the photo above). Considering this is all the one set, the helicopter is a nice touch too, and will add to this set's appeal.

The police &quot;tower&quot; and detached jail cell are, as per common in Lego buildings, under-furnished, but their presence also adds to the set. They don't use many pieces, but considering this set is not only a Jack Stone set aimed at roughly 4 year olds, not to mention from the &quot;juniorisation&quot; era, they aren't terrible. 

The cell itself serves as the launch pad for the helicopter and, obviously, as a place to hold the criminal from the roadster once the police catch him, furnished with a bench for him to sit on. However, the fact that the roof of the cell has to be removed to get the crook in and out of the cell, and there is, like other Lego buildings, no stairs nor even decorative ladders for the Jack Stone people to clime up to get to the helicopter. This is very disappointing considering the lack of pieces in this set. I would've thought they could've done something as simple as this to add to this sets realism (which was low to begin with).

This problem is also faced in the tower. While there is a way to get down for a change, there's no real way for them to get back up (presuming they can't climb back up the poll). While I no not many people will physically move the figure up and down any stairs or ladders provided in sets, its still a nice touch that adds to, as I said earlier, the realism of the set. As for the other aspects of the tower, there are a few computers and a brick with two &quot;wanted&quot; criminals' faces printed on it. Considering each level of the tower has only one wall, I don't imagine these computers would fare well if it happened to rain...

I think the main appeal in this set, on a wider spectrum, is the parts. Once the large blue and grey panels are removed from the cell and tower, the remaining black base plates and white pillars could be a nice addition to a building site. The large amount of see-through orange bricks could be versatile for other Lego creations, and the big printed &quot;Police&quot; sign could also come in handy. Then there is of course the wheels and maybe even the car and helicopter base plates, &quot;windscreens&quot;, unique steering wheels, and some other miscellaneous accessories like the camera.

The Jack Stone figures may or may not be desirable for use in your System town. They're a little too outstanding for my liking, but I don't think it is fare to judge them, considering their juniorisation.

All in all, this set could prove fun or very useful in spare parts depending on who is playing with it. For the reason that it could never be a set that is &quot;suitable for anyone&quot; and &quot;universally good&quot;, it can only get a 3, but it cannot fall lower due to its potential.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
