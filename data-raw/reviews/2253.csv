I genuinely mean this. Every aspect of this set is to some degree, perfection. Surely, the perfect LEGO set could have never existed. I thought this, as many others did. One can only find perfection within subjectivity. But this set... This small set, a set one could have bought with pocket change they found on the floor... It surpasses subjectivity. It is in a sense, beyond just being a &#39;toy&#39; for &#39;children&#39;.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""line-height:1.38; margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-size:11pt; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-family:Arial""><span style=""color:#000000""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""text-decoration:none"">I really do mean every aspect of this set is perfect. Examining the graphic design on the wing piece that makes up the majority of the glider, one can see masterful simplicity. The arrows point towards the middle, showing you where to place the majestic 5 LEGO Pieces that make up the bulk of the set. There is a number four which is mirrored in the middle section, perhaps symbolic of things I am simply too naive to comprehend. The holes in the middle section are perfectly situated, and require masterful precision in order not to accidentally crease the high quality plastic print out. One may notice that the arrow sections are coloured to match a beautiful sky. Initially before making myself familiar with this set, I believed the arrows to just be transparent. I was wrong. I was confused at first... Why would LEGO make it so the arrows are coloured like the sky...yet make you unable to see the sky before them? But then it occurred to me. This is symbolic of the great fortune owning this set will bring to you. Every single day of your life will be a bright day upon owning this set.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Simplicity is an important tool to master amidst the complex craft of art. As Albert Einstein once said, &quot;If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough&quot;. Such a quote can be applied to art, any form of it. You must master simplicity in order to be a true artist. I do believe the designer for this set, set 4612-1 was a smart man. A genius perhaps. I do not believe however that he intended for this set to end up as perfect as it did. One could easily write a philosophical thesis on the idea that every brilliant work of art could be attributed to human error, but I am not here to talk about such an idea. I am here to simply state that the build consisting of two orange slope 45 2 x 2 , a Light Gray Slope Inverted 45 4 x 2 Double with Pins, a common propeller piece and the White Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Handles - Flat Ends, Low Attachment is perfect in portraying what it needed to.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Everybody knows how the Jack Stone minifigures work in comparison to regular minifigures, and sure, they are quite controversial. I will not deny that. But I can only admire LEGO&#39;s choice to do something as daring as to remove all possibility of customisation, oversize the figure and make them look unappealing and ugly to the untrained simpleton mind. Of course, I admit that I am letting my bias seep through here. I feel the Jack Stone figure itself is simply a complement to the masterful build of the rest of the set.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>In the end I could definitely continue on for hours upon hours regarding my views on this LEGO set, I could have touched upon the playability, the fact that upon attempting to throw the glider to see if it truly can glide, it will simply fall to the ground. I am no physics major, but I do believe this was an intentional choice by the designer. It is simply yet more symbolism packed into the set. In life, we all attempt to super glide...but in the end, is it not true that we all plummet? A grim and nihilistic message sure, but when you notice that the set does not crumble, does not fall apart upon crashing to the ground, you realise that this is the second part of this message. We may fall, we may plummet to the ground. But we can get up unscathed. That is what the designer is trying to tell us.</p>

<p>Thank you LEGO Jack Stone Set 4612-1 Super Glider. Thank you for everything.</p>
