<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The set is displayed against a cartoony airport. There's a comic in the back.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The best part of the set is the parts. You get two large plane wings, a large wheel piece, a tail fin, a propeller, and a few other useful parts. Still, 20 parts for 4 dollars isn't very good...<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>It's a cruddy pilot. He can't do that much and he doesn't really fit the part of a figure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's boring. In fact-it's just stacking.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's really ugly. With just a few more parts, LEGO could have made this set a lot better-but aside from being little more than a plank with angles, the ""front"" is barren, and the pilot would fly off in real life. Not very safe.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I would NOT recommend this set. It's ugly. The Jack Stone theme has left it's mark-let's hope that it's never brought back.<br></p>",TRUE,1,2,1,1,1
