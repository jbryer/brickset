I really loved it, but it wasn't long after that i took it apart, just like my dobby's release set of HP. I still use the minifig for other stuff but i dont care for it that much!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"tisi","2012-10-15T11:22:41.237Z","Is THIS a vehicle?? Are you kidding me??","<p>I still hate the whole theme, but I think I have to write the review. (Someone gave 5 points - I can't understand him.) I got this as a child, but I don't remember playing with it. I try to stay calm. (It won't be easy.)<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I don't own the box, and I don't remember of it. The instructions are on a very small folded paper and consist of one picture.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>I think no one can design a good-looking and playable tanker truck out of 34 elements, even if the minifig consists of one single part. And this set's designers couldn't do it too. No windscreen, no lamps and no roof. But we get some useless Jack Stone-parts, ridiculously big wheels and steering wheel, and a box which should include the fuel, but it would flow out if box is opened. At least there is a useful pipe.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The poor guy is too juniorized, it consists of one part. He looks like a fat four-year-old with his turquoise cap, waistcoat and pants. His hands can't be moved, and his head is very strange with the pointless ears and nose. Boah.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It takes one minute, nothing interesting there.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's as ugly as the other Jack Stone sets. Juniorized, shameful, unsightly, nasty and hideous.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I think that even a four-year-old wouldn't like to play with this 'vehicle'. Totally useless parts, nasty design, ugly minifig. Don't buy Jack Stone sets, it isn't worth.</p><p>Aaaaaaaaaaand I've done - I stayed calm!</p><p>Thanks for reading, and sorry for my bad English grammar :D.<br></p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
