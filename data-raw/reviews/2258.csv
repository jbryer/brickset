2 cool minifigures
cool blades

Falls apart easily
WAY TO JUNIORIZED

"diehardlegofan","2011-02-08T12:10:18.29Z","From the Perspective of a Four-Year-Old","Alright, people; this set is intended for four year olds, so my review is totally based on what I thought of it when I was four. &nbsp;I got this for my birthday, I think. &nbsp;Bottom line is I loved it. &nbsp;Even though I was too young to even pay attention to what quality the design was, I still loved it. &nbsp;Yeah, I look at it now and I don't see anything special about it. &nbsp;The pieces are a little big, the minifigures are a little big, and the design is a little simple. &nbsp;But if any of you remember being four, you'll know how big your imagination was; and how you could use that imagination to turn a boring old plain into a super high-tech jet (or something). &nbsp;And when you got bored of the super high-tech jet, you turned it into a super high-tech CAR! &nbsp;And when you got bored of that, you turn it into a SUBMARINE! &nbsp;Basically, what I'm trying to say is that this set is so much fun when you have imagination and creativity (which isn't that hard to have when you're four). &nbsp;Heck, even eight year olds could play with this thing. &nbsp;This set is downright awesome. &nbsp;I highly recommend it to ANY kid.",FALSE,4,5,3,5,3
"tisi","2013-03-01T12:56:50.65Z","Why, why, WHY?","<p>What's the point of the whole Jack Stone theme? I can't believe that someone REALLY likes this piece of rubbish! OK...breathe in...breathe out...breathe in...breathe out...I'm calm now. But let's see the review now.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Some of the pieces (the yellow plate, the propellers) can be useful.<br></li><li>Hmm...is there anything else? (No, there isn't.)<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The minifigs are as ugly as they can be. Nose? Why have they nose? And their hands are unmoveable, they are too big, their uniforms are strange, and they are terribly nasty!<br></li><li>28 pieces? What the hell? And most of them are useless, juniorized parts.</li><li>The whole plane. It doesn't make sense. There are holes on the front, and it looks very, very horrible! The colours are mixed - the engine is orange and on the plane's wing's end there is a red part!<br></li><li>10 dollars? Someone paid ten dollars for this garbage? And if we calculate the inflation, nowadays it would be even more expensive! Come on, there are dozens of other cool Lego sets what you can buy for 10 dollars!</li></ul>
<p>Don't buy this set, even if someone pays for you for buying it! Dear Lego, why did you do this? It's a very awful theme at all with no positive attitudes!</p><p><br></p><p>Thanks for reading, and sorry for my bad English grammar. :D<br></p>",TRUE,1,1,1,1,1
