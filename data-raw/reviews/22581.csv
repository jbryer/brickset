There's a picture of a minifigure in the bottom of each page, which I initially thought might be a little flip animation, but no such luck - they are identical.<br><br>The main draw of the notebook though is the embedded green plate and then the new letter and number tiles. These are not as useful as I first thought, either for MOCing purposes or even for writing things on the front of the book.<br><br>There are two main problems: <br><br>1. Whilst the letters have different coloured backgrounds red, yellow or lime (they've previously only been made in black), all instances of a given letter are the same colour, so all the Es are red, all the Ls yellow etc. This is great if you want a random look, but if you wanted to use them in a MOC, it would not be useful, unless you got very lucky and wanted to write BENT, COLOUR (although you can't write that - see point 2), or MAP.<br><br>2. The distribution is somewhat screwy. It's obviously been put together for all countries at the same time, but I think there are some errors too. There is only one O, and three Qs. The BrickLink inventory confirms this, so it's not just my notebook.<br>",TRUE,3,3,1,1,3
