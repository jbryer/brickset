Since Lego didn't make any big airplane capable of carrying many passagers this was the one to get. It comes with the orange engines and sliver proplers. It is really easy to put togther and can carry many passngers. I would give it a five. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Overall, those engines look beautiful! The only problem is how it gets boring when you grow older.

<p>Big by normal Lego plane standards. The kids (8 &amp; 10) like it. The engines, big single plate wings and printed body sections don&#39;t feel very Lego-ish&nbsp;to me.<br />

I guess the 2000s&nbsp;fell between my KFOL and AFOL days.</p>
