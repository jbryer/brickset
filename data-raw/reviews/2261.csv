"Cornwell","2008-05-03T18:09:23.5Z","A wonderful classic","Having grown up with an older brother, one of the great advantages was inheriting a lot of LEGO. Because of that, this was one of the first sets ever to come into my possession.

The Mobile Rocket Launcher is one of those kits that really makes you realize how LEGO became such a great hit.

The vehicle is detachable from the hanger transporting the rocket, the aft section of the vehicle is turnable, with a hinged satellite antenna, the rocket itself is build onto the hinged launchpad, meaning it had to be dismantled every &quot;launch&quot;, and resulting in some of the parts for the rocket to have wear and tear of 10-15 years of regular launches.

All in all, this is a great kit for its simple sentimental value, and for the complex simplicity of the older kits. Consisting of something around 40-50 pieces, it still had enormous value in playtime.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Many of the later sets opted for more pizazz in their aesthetic design, but with less functionality.

This set, however is exactly what it says; a Mobile Rocket Launcher.  The front vehicle has a cool, spinning radar station with a computer and dish on a side attachment.  And the rear has the actual rocket complete with a hinge launch arm and an early prototype 'satellite'.  There is a slight design fail in having the gray right angle bracket right in the middle of the rocket, but I figured you can detatch the gray bracket along with the rocket. It's much easier than dismantling the rocket every time.  Aside from that one flaw, this is a great early set with lots of play value.  Highly recommended.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
