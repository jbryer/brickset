As with the first Season this set features thirteen episodes, and has been enjoyable.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The case features an action shot of the Ninja in their NRG forms facing off against the Serpentine who are reaching for a Fangblade. Pretty much everything from the first season plot wise, so we don&rsquo;t spoil anything. Each disc features only an image of Lloyd embossed on it and there&rsquo;s not much else.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most regular DVD releases there is no Minifigure included with this release.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Each disc contains a certain number of episodes, disc number one has 7 episodes and disc two features the remaining 6. Not much else to discuss really, the menus and main images are fairly simple and the theme song continues to play on repeat before you hit play. The episodes are just as good as the previous season too, with a lot of impressive animation improvements and a very engaging storyline.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This season was meant to be the last, as evidenced by the final battle against the Overlord, because I believe Season Three was the reboot era which started to bring more ideas to the Ninjago world.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a pretty decent offering, but as with Season One, since you can pick up both sets in a budget pack I&rsquo;d definitely recommend that over the individual releases if you didn&rsquo;t pick up these sets when they first came out. LEGO Ninjago has been going on for a good number of years now as a television show and it&rsquo;s extremely impressive they can continue to cook up new ideas for the storyline. I loved re-watching the entire season with this set and look forward to finally seeing all of Season Three once I pick that one up.</p>
