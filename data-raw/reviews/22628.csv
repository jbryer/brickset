As with many characters from the past couple of series', it's often difficult to assume a look for many of the titles as they can be particularly ambiguous, and I feel that a librarian is no exception. Sit back for a second, and visualise what a typical librarian may look like...<div><br></div><div>In truth, this minifigure looks more like a regular visitor to the library than an actual librarian, but I have no real qualms over the title. What is perhaps more important is that the character itself looks absolutely fabulous - detailed with some beautiful printing that highlights a smart but, fashionably, 'buttoned-up' outfit. Combine the patterned sweater with thick-rimmed glasses, and what you have is a girl/lady who clearly knows how to look cool and sophisticated.</div><div><br></div><div>The mug is also delightful and certainly one of a kind; the 'Shhh!' text clear and relevant. The included book - titled Oranges and Peaches - is acceptable but not ideal. As you will see in the promotional image, the Librarian is clutching the book from behind so we can't see <i>how </i>it is being held, but in real life, it is too thick to grip. The book needs to be open to be held in any sort of way, and over time this will weaken the soft plastic joint on the book spine.</div><div><br></div><div>There is a lot of versatility in the character that makes it ideal to play with, but it will look equally good on display. I personally think she looks wonderful, and is a great addition to one of the best collectable minifigure series yet.</div>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4

<p>The Librarian is pure fun from the head down to the toes, she has a single-sided torso print, which some may consider dissapointing, I do not. Wearing a sweater over a blouse this is not your stereotypical old spinster librarian from decades past. She's modern, she's young, she's going to tell you to shhhh if you are too loud and you'd better listen to her. I could do with a slightly better shade of browinsh beige for the skirt honestly, I think if it were slightly darker for that particular area of the print it might pop more and look less plain. I suppose though that libraries are not the place for popping, functional not fashionable as the saying goes.</p>
<p>I say this is a new hair piece and that's true, to a certain degree, I believe it was introduced in the Harry Potter Theme for Ginny, or possibly Luna one year, I could be mistaken, however if I'm not it's nice to see this in brown instead of red or blonde. The stylish glasses on her facial print are brought more to the attention of the eye when surrounded by the long front bangs, the only issue I have with the piece is the fact that it limits mobility.</p>
<p>She has a cup with printed Shhh on it for her coffee or tea, she's carrying a book Oranges and Peaches, based off of a classic joke according to the Character Encyclopedia. (Or misunderstanding) Overall this is a must have Mini-Figure, and she isn't too terribly difficult to feel out while searching for her, I must have found ten or more while trying to track down her fellow case mate the Trendsetter. Strongly Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,4

She was released in May, 2013, where she retailed for only $2.99. She includes 7 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look, shall we?</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that hair piece, and while the piece itself was not new, the colour it&#39;s caste in was new for the figure, if I&#39;m not mistaken. I love the use of that piece, and I think it somehow really fits the figure, with how the straight, brown bands hang down onto the torso. It&#39;s nice seeing it in dark brown, versus the more common orange and yellow.</p>

<p>Next is her face print, which is yet another very fitting addition to the character. I really love how she&#39;s depicted with glasses, as it makes her look both smart and unique, as we didn&#39;t have too many spectacle-wearing face prints back in the day. She does not have any back facial printing, which is expected from a 2013 CMF.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, and it is yet another fitting piece for the figure. I adore all the intricate detail on it, from the buttons down the middle, to the pattern on the chest. She has a nice tan vest as well. However, she has no back torso printing, which is a bit of a shame, but is to be expected.</p>

<p>Finishing off the base of the figure, we have her legs, which have a bit of printing. I do like how LEGO incorporated leg detailing, though it isn&#39;t anything to get worked up over. I dig the ruffles at the top, and I like the yellow flesh printing that actually carry over to the sides of the legs.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessories, and this figure comes with two, the first of which is that white coffee cup with &quot;Shhh&quot; printed on it. That print is very fitting, and the choice of including a coffee cup is a very smart one indeed. Her second accessory is that book with &quot;Oranges and Peaches&quot; printed on the front cover. Of course that is the older-style book piece, which means the figure cannot hold it in her hands, which is a shame. I personally despise that piece all in all because of that, but back in 2013, there was no alternative. I do like the inclusion, however, and I suppose it was nice of LEGO to include an exclusive print with it as well.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, I sort of despise Series 10, and there are only a few figures I actually like in the series. Fortunately, this Librarian is one of them. This is a concept that shouldn&#39;t translate well into CMF form, yet it translates wonderfully. I love all the prints, and the accessories really complement the figure. Overall, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 4 out of 5.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
