<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Parts</b></div>

<div>There are four parts included to make Medusa, and all are wonderful. She has a new hairpiece to represent her snake hair, which is made of rubber, but is not as soft as the Crazy Scientist&#39;s, but more along the line of Lady Liberty&#39;s. The piece is very detailed with snake heads and tails poking out all over, and a few framing Medusa&#39;s face. Another bonus is that the hair covers up the double-sided head properly! One thing I didn&#39;t like as much is that a minifigure can&#39;t hold the snake hair, so a hero cannot hold Medusa&#39;s severed head, except for underneath. This I can forgo, however, due to its excellent appearance.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;The head is just as detailed, cast in sand green. I am happy, that with the dawn of olive green, that LEGO chose this color instead. It is double sided, as mentioned before. Both sides depict dark green lips, fangs, cheekbones and sunken eyes, with the eyes having no pupils. The expressions are different, however. One face shows Medusa with lime green eyes, with mouth closed and fangs protruding, with a raised eyebrow, as if assessing the situation. The other side shows her with golden eyes, with angry eyebrows and her mouth open as if hissing. She now looks like she is turning someone to stone! I love that her face is double-sided, as it allows more playability.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The torso is also detailed, with no back printing. The torso is also sand green, but Medusa has brown leathery chest armor. The armor has fangs pointing down on either side, and is decorated at the top with intertwined snakes.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The last piece is also excellent. It is one of the snake tail pieces, which I am happy to have, as I missed out on the Ninjago ones. It is dark green and printed with a scale pattern that forms an &quot;M&quot; underneath. The snake tail is most likely inspired by <i>Clash of the Titans</i>, as it was never there in Greek mythology. It does make the minifigure better, though. While others may say, &quot;I wish she had a bow and arrow&quot;, I am glad they didn&#39;t give her one, as Medusa using a bow and arrow is even less mythologically accurate than a snake tail, and does nothing for her character (in my opinion).</div>

<div><b>The Build</b></div>

<div>What build? Just build the minifigure!</div>

<div><b>Playability</b></div>

<div>Her playability is not great unless you can build an environment of grey bricks, and make some grey minifigures, but the double-sided face enhances it.</div>

<div><b>Summary</b></div>

<div>As Medusa is my favorite Greek monster, I am glad to have her. I would recommend this minifigure to any Greek mythology fan!</div>

"Odeinoichus","2013-08-03T16:45:21.323Z","The Mythological Menace","<p><strong>Set #71001 Medusa:</strong> How many times have you looked at LEGO Mini-Figures and wondered, why isn't there a Greek Gorgon? Well ask such questions no longer, for Medusa, she who turns all to stone with her very gaze, has arrived.</p>
<p>Re-using the Ninjago Serpentine Leader's tail piece, Medusa is cast all in green plastics of various shades, dark and light. She has a scaly pattern printed on the front of her lower body, which would have been impressive if it carried onto her torso, but not altogether accurate to how a Gorgon looks. Her torso is a single-sided print with a curious bustier on, it almost looks as though it were fashioned from the head of some giant serpent, two fangs hanging down on either side and twin serpents acting as a fastener at the top. Had LEGO thought to include back printing this would have been even better, as it stands it's still quite impressive.</p>
<p>Her new hair piece is limited, I can't honestly imagine them re-using it for anyone else, however LEGO does have a way of surprising you. This is the only double-sided head in the bunch, one side calm and almost friendly, the other frightening with glowing&nbsp;orange eyes, prepare to be turned to stone.</p>
<p>Overall she's well worth the price, and if you're lucky enough to own more than one of her, you've got a veritable army of LEGO Gorgons to unleash on the world of Mythological Mini-Figures. She compliments the Cyclops and Minotaur quite nicely, now all we need is the hero Perseus with his shining mirror shield and swift sword to help end her threat. Strongly recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,3,4

<p>Medusa , back in 2013 , was the figure of this series that I personally yearned to get .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure uses a rubbery hair piece with her snake heads moulded in , a calm expression and a nightmare inducing ferocious print which matches the character , the torso is accurate and the legs are the snake piece with front printing and a long dark green two .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is in my top three favourite CMFs ever , the printing detail is so fun and accurate and let&#39;s be honest ignoring Mr Golds value and uncommon nature of you showed a child him and a child her , she is so much more interesting of a figure so I recommend it to all .&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2022-03-25T21:47:34.777Z","BETTER than MR. GOLD?","<p>The second minifigure in LEGO Minifigures Series 10 is Medusa! This figure was released way back in the golden year of 2013, where she retailed for a shockingly cheap $2.99, compared to todays CMF prices. This character includes 5 pieces. Now let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that amazingly detailed hair piece that was designed exclusively for this figure. That piece may be my favourite part of the entire figure, as I really dig all the intricate snake heads, and how they jut out in all different directions, giving the piece a sense of movement and realism. I love the choice of casting it in green, and that whole sculpt is made entirely out of rubber, which is understandable, since the snakes would be sharp, had they been caste from plastic.</p>

<p>Next up is her head piece, which has a really nice expression of pure anger. First off, I love the colour used for it, as it is that sand green tone, which really complements the green hair and tail. She has a very menacing snarling face, where we can see both sharp white teeth protruding from her black mouth. The detailing around the eyes are superb, and I love the choice of including orange eyes. As if that isn&#39;t cool enough, she has an alternate expression, which is extremely shocking yet strongly welcome! I like the alternate look, as it has a more chill expression than the primary print. I love how the alternate look reverts to green eyes, rather than the enraged orange ones. Back facial printing was rare back then, so it was extremely amazing to get it with this figure!</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which shares that nice sickly green colour. I like how her bra is made of scales, and how snake skin covers the top. However, I&#39;m disappointed in the lack of back torso printing, as it could have really finished the look of the snake-skin bra. Without back printing, it does look a little blank.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have that long tail piece. The piece itself was not new for the figure, as it was a reuse of the LEGO Ninjago Serpentine Leader&#39;s tailpiece. I absolutely love the design of this piece, being as it is caste in green to match the figure. I also dig how the scales form a mischievous &quot;M&quot; at the top. But with that being said, Medusa has never had a tail in Green mythology. Like I read in a review of this figure written by 8BrickMario, Medusa was depicted having a tail in the movie, <em>Clash of the Titans. </em>Perhaps that was where LEGO got the idea. Either way, I personally dig this piece, and I dig how far it stretches at the back of the figure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, I am not a fan of Series 10, despite their being a few good figures in the series. Honestly, this minifigure takes the cake as best of the series, even beating out Mr. Gold in the design aspect. I adore the new hair piece, the tail is a great inclusion, and this was just such a great concept that translated very well into Minifigure form. If you&#39;re into Greek mythology, maybe you should consider ordering this figure off Ebay!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thank you all for reading!</p>
