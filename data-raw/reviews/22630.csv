It looks like a very cool and varied series and LEGO seems to try their best to step it up for each series. I honestly think there's something for every taste and liking with series 10. I like the historic/mythological figures from each series and was pleasantly surprised to get the Roman Commander while doing some random shopping today.<div><br></div><div>If you like the historic figures and if you have a couple of the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8827-10"">Roman Soldier</a> already, you can't afford to miss out on the commander. This is truly a stunning figure that you can use to re-enact Ancient MOCs, play or perhaps in a Lego City museum?</div><h4>The figure.</h4><div><b>Head:</b> This guy comes with a stern one-sided face, eye-brows that ""spell"" <i>d-e-c-i-s-i-o-n</i> and he also has a week-long stubbly beard. This is someone that you don't mess around with and clearly needs to seek up a barber and a bath-tub.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Torso:</b> It is only printed at the front, but it is sufficient enough. Instead of the Roman Soldier's grey colour scheme they have used a darker grey, dotted with brown and bronze-coloured details. There's a small wolfs head at the top (homage to the founders of Rome and their legacy with the wolf) which I think is cool.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Legs:</b> They continue in the same colour-scheme as the torso (brown-bronze), giving the impression of leather armour. You can also see a darker red tunic underneath. The ""feet"" have sandals, represented by a thin line.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Accessories:</b> Being a commander (Centurion), this guy is distinguished from ordinary army men by his plumed helmet. That too is a more darker grey. The red plume is removable (unlike that of the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8684-2"">Spartan Warrior's</a> helmet) and is a new piece, I imagine. You also get a Roman short sword (gladius) and a red cloak.</div><div><br></div><div>I am very impressed with this plastic guy.

"Odeinoichus","2013-08-02T19:36:52.847Z","The General","<p><strong>Set #71001 Roman Commander:</strong> At last the armies of Rome in LEGO have a commander.</p>
<p>The Roman Commander Mini-Figure is one that a lot of fans of the Collectible Mini-Figures seem to have wanted since the Legionaire was first introduced. LEGO has not dissapointed the fans this time, they've given us a brilliant printed Mini-Fig to put next to the armies of Legionaires you've picked up. Provided you've managed to of course. The torso is only single-sided, but it has great detail work on the abdomen, the armor and the small wolf head shaped necklace.</p>
<p>The legs have some printing as well, showing his armor and some strips on his feet meant to represent sandal straps. Accessory-wise he includes the Roman helmet, a sword and a new attachement to represent his status as the commander, this is the piece that can trip you up during the feel method if you're looking for any of the 1x2 tile pieces other Mini-Figures might have. He also comes with a nice dark red cape, a very nice piece and excellent for MOCing custom figures.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this is one of the better offerings from Series 10, it complements many other Mini-Figures from past series, especially the Legionaire and the Roman Emperor. Definitely recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3
"Black_Leader","2015-12-23T19:28:06.173Z","Veni, Vidi, Vici Lego Style","<p>Rome&nbsp;wasn&#39;t&nbsp;built&nbsp;in day and nether was a Roman legion, not even a Lego one. A &nbsp;year after we got a&nbsp;superb&nbsp;Roman soldier in Series 6, we finally get someone to boss him around&nbsp;in&nbsp;Series&nbsp;10. With the new commander, the Series 9 Roman Emperor, and the aforementioned soldier, we seem to have the makings of a brick built empire brewing. So how does the Roman Commander stack up against his Latin predecessors?</p>

<h3>Head</h3>

<p>The head of the Roman commander is single sided, the sole side featuring a worried expression with gritted teeth and lots of stubble. Personally I think this expression is unbefitting of a general and looks constipated, but that&#39;s just me.</p>

<h3>Torso</h3>

<p>Unlike the shinier sliver of his underling, the torso of the Roman Commander is done in gun metal gray with bronze accents. The bronze belt of circles&nbsp;within squares looks good and I particularly&nbsp;like the bronze wolf pendant, which is most likely a homage to the wolf that raised the legendary founders of Rome. As a side note, apparently an important element of Roman&nbsp;armor design was the ability to accentuate one&#39;s abs. I suppose it makes up for the looseness of togas.There is no back printing on this figure, which is fine since it would be covered by the cape anyway.</p>

<h3>Legs</h3>

<p>Like the other Roman figures, the Roman Commander features lines on the feet to represent sandals. These look fine but one has wonder if there may be better choice of footwear for marching around the Mediterranean. The rest of the legs feature a dark red tunic with leather studded bronze that works well with the cape and torso.</p>

<h3>Accessories</h3>

<p>The only new part included with this minifigure&nbsp;is the red horsehair plum that looks fairly realistic and fits into a hole on the top of the helmet. The helmet is the same fantastic mold that was included with the Roman soldier, only this time in a darker, non shiny gray. For battling barbarians the commander carries a gladius (short sword), introduced with the Series 5 Gladiator and found here in the same gray as the helmet. The red cape that adorns the commander is nothing new but it is part that it is always nice to get more of. As always, there is the danger of severe crinkling, but overall it ties the figure together splendidly.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>As a figure that has been highly desired by fans since Series 6, the Roman Commander delivers. He fits in well with the other Romans while also improving upon their style. Whether or not you like his face is a personal preference&nbsp;and that can easily be remedied. I believe this is one of the standouts of Series 10.&nbsp;If you already have a Lego Roman army, or even if you don&#39;t, this is a figure to look out for.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-04-11T23:43:16.88Z","a LAZY concept???","<p>Hello! Sideswinger here, taking a close look at the LEGO Minifigures Series 10 Roman Commander. This character was released in 2013, where it retailed for only $2.99. He includes 8 pieces. Now let&#39;s&nbsp;take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that helmet, which is made up of two pieces. The shooey on top of the helmet&nbsp;(as my mom calls it), was a new piece made exclusively for this character. I do appreciate the inclusion of a new piece, albeit it isn&#39;t super interesting. It pegs into a small hole at the top of the helmet. Speaking of which, that helmet is a recolour of that&nbsp;helmet piece introduced in the Series 6 Roman Warrior. However, while the Roman Warrior sported a shiny silver helmet, the Roman Commander features a dark grey colour, which is a much more melancholy colour for that piece.</p>

<p>Next is that face print, which I suppose is a good expression. I appreciate just how agitated and fierce it looks, with that angry scowl in the middle of the short stubble. I appreciate the tan colour of that beard, and I do suppose that expression is somewhat useful outside of the setting. He does not have any alternative expressions, which is to be expected from a 2013 CMF.</p>

<p>Next is his cape, and while that material isn&#39;t as good as the felt texture introduced in 2015, I like the inclusion of a cape coloured in that dark red tone, as it could maybe be used for a muted superhero cape or something; your imagination is the limit.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which really isn&#39;t anything super special or interesting. It&#39;s caste in a dark grey colour, and I suppose the printing on it is decent, where it does have that bronze belt dotted with intricate detailing. I like the brown sash, as well as that little wolf emblem near the collar. He does not have any back torso printing, which is kind of lazy, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Next is the legs, which are probably the most detailed part of the figure, though that isn&#39;t saying much, considering there have been more detailed CMF legs before 2013. Still, I appreciate the dark red printing at the front and sides of the legs, and I like the dark brown armouring on the waist and thighs. Perhaps the most impressive part of the legs are those razor thin shoes at the very bottom of the feet, which are printed on the front and sides.</p>

<p>The only accessory packed in with this bad boy is that small gladiator-like sword. I suppose it&#39;s a fitting accessory, but it just comes off as boring and lazy to me. LEGO should&#39;ve at least included two swords.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, I used to really dig this character, and referred to him as one of the only good figures to be found in Series 10. However, the more time passed, the less I liked this guy, and since I&#39;m writing this in 2022, I really don&#39;t like this minifigure. Having already gotten multiple superior Roman themed CMF&#39;s prior to this figure, I feel like the concept behind this was so lazy and bad, that the quality of the figure itself suffers. This is far from the worst in Series 10, but it&#39;s even farther from being one of my favourites. Overall, I&#39;m gonna have to give this guy an unfortunate 2 out of 10; not because he&#39;s horrid, but because he&#39;s bad.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading, and stay safe out there!</p>
