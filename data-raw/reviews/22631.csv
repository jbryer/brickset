<p>This warrior woman is a great addition to female Mini-Figure collections, and the large group of historical and mythological Mini-Figures of the Collectible MF Series. Sadly she does have a few minor issues, for one thing her hair piece isn't new, we've seen it before in other colors, this is our first brunette colored version. Also the torso is a single-sided print, the one side print detailing is great though.</p>
<p>Like similar Mini-Figures before her she has leg printing, showing off a warrior woman tradition of battle skirt with protective armor detailing. She's wearing some tough leather boots too. Brown leather naturally. She's carrying the familiar shield and spear we've seen many times before, the print on the shield is that of a bird with wings spread wide in gold, it's a nice touch and the gold tipped spear matches nicely.</p>
<p>Overall I don't think you can go without at least owning two or three of these to go with Wonder Woman, a determined looking facial print is a nice touch on this Mini-Figure. I will admit though she could use some back printing on the torso to better match up with the highly detailed print LEGO did for her front, and it might have been nice to have a friendlier expression on the back of her head also. Still recommended though, and try to get a few for parts and army building purposes.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,4
"sideswinger","2022-04-12T23:38:13.373Z","a HISTORICAL minifigure!","<p>Hey everyone! Sideswinger here, and today we&#39;re reviewing the LEGO Minifigures Series 10 Warrior Woman! This figure was released in 2013, where it retailed for only $2.99. She includes 7 pieces. Now let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that long, wavy hair piece that was introduced in LEGO Minifigures Series 2. This time around, it&#39;s caste in black, which was a new colour for that hair piece. I really dig that piece, and I always love seeing it used in CMF&#39;s. The detail on that piece is very intricate, and I appreciate how it is caste in a new and exclusive colour.</p>

<p>Next we have the head piece, and while it isn&#39;t anything super impressive, I love getting generic facial expressions that are highly usable outside of the setting. She has that angry snarl, with barred teeth, and I like the small indented cheekbone prints. She doesn&#39;t have an alternative expression, which is sad, but very expected.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which I suppose does have some pretty great printing. She&#39;s sporting a stylish brown armour-outfit, that has some nice gold accents on the top and sides. There&#39;s a small strand of gold trim going right down the centre, but she does not have any back torso printing, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>Her legs feature lots of great detail! They&#39;re caste in a light nougat tone, and the brown leather is printed on both the front and sides. I&#39;m very impressed at how crisp that printing looks, especially since this was long before dual-moulded legs were invented. She sports some golden scales atop the knees, and I like how her yellow flesh is printed over the legs.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her two accessories, both of which are very great pieces. I love the inclusion of that shield, and how it&#39;s caste in dark brown. The gold emblem on front is very nicely printed, and it sort of reminds me of the original Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. logo from the MCU. It&#39;s interesting to note that this is the first time that Captain America shield was ever used in a CMF. This CMF also includes that massive spear piece, which is, of course, dual moulded: the dark brown pole piece is a hard plastic, while the golden tip on top is moulded and caste in rubber. It comes together for an excellent accessory, and one that fits the figure very well.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, I sort of despise Series 10. That&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t a few keepers in the series, those being the Librarian, Medusa, a couple more decent characters, and honestly, this Warrior Woman figure, just to name a few. I don&#39;t typically like Historical themed CMF&#39;s, considering they&#39;re normally overdone and rehashed. This figure, however, is definitely an exception. I dig this figure! From the&nbsp;intricate hair piece, to the detailed accessories, it comes together for a really fantastic Warrior Woman minifigure. All in all, this is one of my favourite figures of Series 10, and she gets a solid 4 out of 5 from me!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading, and stay safe!</p>
