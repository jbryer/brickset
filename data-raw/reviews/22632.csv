<h4>Parts</h4><p>The parts&nbsp;are what stands out in the set. The torso has plenty of detail and features, some muscles,&nbsp;quite a lot of Indian markings, (which are&nbsp;dark blue&nbsp;curved lines), and a necklace with a light blue and black feather hanging down from&nbsp;it. One thing that this minifigure has&nbsp;that not a lot of minifigs have these days is printing on the arms, on his right&nbsp;arm he has more Indian markings pretty much&nbsp;identical to the ones on his chest. On his left arm he has what looks like a piece of&nbsp;light blue fabric with three diamonds and two stripes, one on the top one on the bottom. But it could just as easily be more markings. </p><p>On his waist he has some small white circles with&nbsp;X' on either side.&nbsp;On his legs he has a loincloth with some skin printed around it.&nbsp;He also has what look like boots.</p><p>His face features some red face paint with even more Indian markings. His mouth is also turned down slightly, however with the eyes it looks more like he is angry rather than sad. Below&nbsp;his mouth are some more markings, which at first looks like a moustache. His Mohawk is rubbery and therefore&nbsp;you might think that does not stay&nbsp;on very well, but it does stay on surprisingly well. It is&nbsp;my first of this piece so I am quite exited about it,&nbsp;though&nbsp;people who already have this mold&nbsp;may not be as exited as I am.&nbsp;</p><p>His tomahawk (which is the same as the one that&nbsp;Tonto holds in a few of the LR sets)&nbsp;is also quite good and has a rubbery blade, which I was not expecting. The blade is silver with a few notches, which makes&nbsp;it look more fearsome. The ""wooden"" part of the tomahawk has a few notches&nbsp;near the top and one at the bottom, perhaps to make it look more realistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is nothing more than a minifigure, but as I stated in the parts section he does have a lot of detailing. He (along with any other CMF) would be a great stocking stuffer etc. His playability is not the best out there, but with some other Indian or some sort of enemy the playability is pretty good.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I recommend you to get it, but maybe start of with one of the others instead.&nbsp;He is also packed four in a box so it shouldn't be to hard to find him.</p><p>Overall I give it a 4/5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,5

I mean how many costume clad Mini-Figs like Chicken Suit Guy would be in an actual set? The Tomahawk Warrior is one that actually comes off as quite clever. And here's why.</p>
<p>For starters we have the Punk Rocker's mohawk style hair piece re-used in a much more useful black color, as some people might prefer to have ordinary mohawk colors for their Mini-Figures than purple. It also introduces us to a new accessory piece, the tomahawk in question, previous LEGO Western Themes just used the black axe firemen carried with&nbsp;a feather clipped on for the tomahawk, this one is a much more true to life representation.</p>
<p>The print on this Mini-Fig is also impressive, with all the fine detail work on his torso and the native markings, the face is also nicely printed and his legs are also printed quite true to life. He even has arm printing on the side, a rarity indeed as there are less than&nbsp;two dozen Mini-Figures with arm printing out there.</p>
<p>Overall a strongly recommended Mini-Figure good for customisers who want to give different Mini-Figs mohawk hair and the new accessory is a must have piece for fans of Western Themes.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3

<p>The Tomahawk warrior was my first CMF and started my journey of collecting them now 68 figures in (at the time of writing this review) this is the one I owe it all to and has the most sentimental value personally .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>This figure uses the Mohawk piece in black , face maintain a stern face , a torso with fantastic printing on both arms but with no back printing and legs with appropriate detailing .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His accessory is a Tomahawk which is dual moulded with a rubbery blade . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this figure is just good , whether it is the torso , head or axe it just works so despite it not being my favourite of the series (medusa takes that spot) I still love it and recommend it to all .</p>

"sideswinger","2022-04-13T23:54:46.363Z","one of the WORST CMF'S EVER???","<p>The fifth minfigure to be found in LEGO Minifigures Series 10 is the Tomahawk Warrior. He was released in 2013, where he retailed for only $2.99. He includes 6 pieces. This is the third CMF to be Indian-themed, which tells me he&#39;s a bit of a lazy choice. However, if the figure is good enough, I may be able to overlook that.&nbsp;Now let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that Mohawk piece that was first introduced in 2011 in LEGO Minifigures Series 4. I believe it was caste in a brand new black tone for this minifigure, which I suppose is a welcome addition. The piece is very detailed, with how each individual spike juts higher and higher leading up to the middle, then gradually sinks back down. That whole piece is caste out of rubber, if you&#39;re curious.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which really does not have anything super interesting. I guess the red face paint is decent, but it looks a little weird with how suddenly it cuts off at the top of the head. He has a very stern look, and does not feature any back head printing.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has some decent detail. I do like how the blue feather is used as a necklace, and I appreciate the markings on the chest. The warrior&#39;s arms sport some very welcome printing, and I think his arms may be my favourite part of the entire figure.</p>

<p>Finishing off the base of the figure itself are his legs, which do include some pretty good details, like the stitched detail on the waist and legs, and yellow flesh on the knees and upper thighs. He doesn&#39;t have any side leg printing, which looks a little bland.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his tomahawk accessory. You may think it&#39;s a new piece designed exclusively for this figure, but rather, that piece was introduced in the Lone Ranger sets released a month or two prior to this CMF. I really wish LEGO would&#39;ve at least caste it in a new colour. But nope! I do like this piece, even though it wasn&#39;t new for the figure. That silver blade portion atop is caste in a nice rubber texture, and the brown, notched pole is done in reddish-brown plastic.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, that&#39;s all for this minifigure! Overall, I really despise Series 10, and honestly, this figure is my least favourite in the whole series; that&#39;s really saying something, considering Series 10 is full of bad figures. For starters, this is an absolutely terrible choice for a CMF. Not only was this the third Indian-themed CMF, but Series 10 had a whopping four historical minifigures, which is a bit much. Not only that, but this figure doesn&#39;t offer anything new or exciting to compensate for that awful choice. Sure, the Mohawk piece is good in that new colour, but it doesn&#39;t save the figure whatsoever. I think his printing is mediocre, his accessory is so lame, and this does not feel worth 3 dollars to me, nor does it seem like it should be a CMF at all. In the end, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 2 out of 5, but that&#39;s being very, very, VERY generous.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Stay safe out there, and thanks for reading!</p>
