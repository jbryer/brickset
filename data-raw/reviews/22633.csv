<p>The Skydiver is an interesting idea for a Mini-Figure, the execution of which is up to interpretation. Personally I think he's a bit of a weaker offering from Series 10, however he's still worth tracking down if only for the new parachute alone. The torso print has tons of straps, belts and clips indicating all of the harnesses parachutists need to wear, his legs also have some of these belts and straps printed on them. The lack of any accessories might turn off some collectors, completists however buy one of each regardless how they feel.</p>
<p>He's wearing the same helmet we've seen on extreme sports Mini-Figs, such as Roller Derby Girl, overall I'd have to say that despite being somewhat limited for parts re-use (although the head's facial print makes a fun looking face for Mini-Figs riding Roller Coasters or blasting off into outer space.) he's still a good looking figure to get. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,3,3

<p>The skydiver is a fun figure but lacks any part of real interest and an accessory is absent .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The helmet is the bike and skate board helmet in line green , the face is very fun with goggles and a very expressive mouth , the neck attachment is a line green bag and the torso and legs are a continuous jumpsuit print .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a fine fig , however the lack of an accessory really does hurt my verdict but the comical face print is quite nice so I recommend it to anyone who was eyeing this figure up .</p>

"sideswinger","2022-04-15T15:21:11.033Z","why'd LEGO pick this CONCEPT???","<p>The sixth minifigure found in the LEGO Minifigures Series 10 is the Skydiver. This figure was released in 2013, where he included 5 pieces and retailed for only $2.99. I used to really despise this figure, so let&#39;s see if my opinion of him has changed over the years!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that helmet, which is caste in a pretty nice lime green tone. I dig getting that piece in that colour, and I appreciate the small holes etched into the helmet around the perimeter.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which is a pretty good print. I really like the goggles covering his eyes, and I adore how his mouth is being blown out from the inside, resembling the rushing current of air he&#39;s feeling whilst falling from the sky.</p>

<p>Next is his parachute, which was a new piece made exclusively for this minifigure. The moulded detailing on it is very impressive, and I love getting it caste in that pleasant lime green colour. Of course, it&#39;s attached at the neck using that hole attachment.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which sports some pretty fantastic detailing. I like all the many buckles and straps, which use light blue, dark blue, and lime green to make a very pleasant colour combination. I don&#39;t believe he has any back torso printing, but I could be wrong about that, considering I don&#39;t have this minifigure in-hand.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have the legs, which have two lime green straps on the thighs. I kind of wish his waist section was caste in blue rather than lime green, but maybe I&#39;m nitpicking. Another feature I wish were included was side-leg printing.</p>

<p>Since he lacks any accessory, that&#39;s it for this figure! I know this review was extremely short, next to my other CMF reviews, but there isn&#39;t a whole lot to talk about with this character. That&#39;s kind of a bad thing, considering this retailed for 3 dollars. I love the parachute piece, but that&#39;s all I really appreciate on this character. It&#39;s a good concept, but LEGO can&#39;t really do much with a &quot;Skydiver&quot; character template. Overall, I&#39;d say this is one of my least favourites of Series 10, but I don&#39;t hate it as much as I used to, now that I now that parachute piece was new. My final verdict of this figure is 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading, and stay safe!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
