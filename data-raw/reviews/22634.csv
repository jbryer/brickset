<h4>Parts</h4><p>For this figure the top is where the parts shine,&nbsp;so lets start there this time. The bee hat she wears does not have any printing, however because of the shape I can tell the designers spent a lot of time on this piece. The antennae made out of rubbery-plastic, which is a bad choice in my opinion because they could be bent when you are feeling the packet for her. The rest of the hat is ""lion yellow"" and also made out of rubbery-plastic. </p><p>The wings&nbsp;are my favorite part of the set because of the reusability for MOCs, etc. They are made of hard plastic which I was not expecting at all, and are&nbsp;""translucent white"".&nbsp;Also as you probably expected are attached via neck bracket. </p><p>The body does not have&nbsp;as much printing as some of the other minifigures in this series but is still nice. It features two black stripes printed&nbsp;horizontally&nbsp;on a&nbsp;""lion yellow"" torso. The hands are black and the arms have no printing, unlike the Tomahawk Warrior which I&nbsp;reviewed last.</p><p>The legs are also ""lion yellow"" and have a single black stripe on them and no other printing</p><p>The jar of honey is also a great piece to have and is brown in color. The printing is also very nice with some honey&nbsp;flowing over the side and a print of a bee. Simple yet great.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed figure is very good and is one of the better minifigures from Series 10. The figure does not have much printing but is accurate to a bee. The playability is&nbsp;very high as you can fly her around the room making her bring honey back to the nest. </p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As I stated in the introduction this figure is one of the rarer minifigures being packed only two per box. I also really like the animal suit figures so that is a plus for me, which earns this figure an...</p><p>Overall of 5/5</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-08-02T19:49:28.967Z","The Honey Lover","<p><strong>Set #71001 Bumblebee Girl:</strong> Wearing animal suits is a favorite passtime of LEGO Collectible Mini-Figs, from Series 3's Gorilla Suit Guy to a fan favorite Chicken Suit Guy of Series 9. Bumblebee Girl is the first female Mini-Fig to dress up and she's an excellent addition to your LEGO Mini-Fig collection.</p>
<p>Dressed all in dark yellow (necessary to diferentiate between normal Mini-Fig yellow coloring.) this Mini-fig introduces us to two&nbsp;spiffy parts, the honey pot with printed bumblebee and dripping honey on the side. (Perfect for Winnie the Pooh) And the head piece, a softer plastic piece with twin antenna on top. Using the Fairy's wings from Series 8 LEGO has captured the costumed look quite nicely.</p>
<p>Her nice big smiling facial print is a welcome addition, with rosy red cheeks (not often seen on Mini-Figs), and red lipstick. The only flaw, indeed a minor one, is the fact that the black stripes painted on the front of the torso do not wrap around to the back. (Most bees tend to have stripes all over, not just in front, however for the purposes of a costume autheticity is not always strictly necessary.)</p>
<p>Overall I'd say this is a must have Mini-Fig from the series, which I find myself saying more often than not where series 10 is concerned. Out of the entire series the only really weak number I personally think of is the Skydiver. And while my ratings seem low for parts and things, that's only because these are simply Mini-Figures, and they must be rated accordingly. Recommend you go out and find this gem of a Mini-Fig before she vanishes back to the hive.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4
