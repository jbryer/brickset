"Odeinoichus","2013-07-29T12:16:19.363Z","The Grumbler","<p><strong>Set #71001 Grandpa:</strong> Grandparents are also not very often found in LEGO City sets, this Mini-Figure is therefore a fun new addition for any Mini-Figure collection.</p>
<p>Grandpa introduces for the first time a LEGO Bald Cap head piece, previous Mini-Figures have simply relied on the stud top of their head to be bald, now LEGO has taken the time to make a brand new head piece with sculpted hair detail. Not much use outside of very old citizens at the moment, however I think we'll be seeing it again in future sets or with future figures that could be middle aged or younger bald persons. The sculpt and detail work on the bald cap is impressive.</p>
<p>Grandpa's torso print is two sided, with a frumpy looking shirt, and a nifty bowtie, plus suspenders. The print is all kinds of fun, and isn't age specific really so the torso can be re-used for others. Accessory wise he only has a white cup without any printing on it, and a tile printed with the Old Times representing a newspaper out of LEGO City's past.</p>
<p>Overall this Mini-Figure is a great addition from Series 10, with a wonderful looking print and lot's of attention to detail. Even the facial print shows care and attention for such a tiny figure, with a moustache and old functional, but not fashionable glasses. Reccomended. And I hope we see his head piece re-used in future waves of LEGO Mini-Figures.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"Studded_Dud","2020-07-26T20:41:33.107Z","Old Times","<p>Parts: The Grandpa holds a white cup and a newspaper. The white cup is bland and doesn&#39;t have any design on it. The newspaper on the other hand has a printed design saying, &ldquo;Old Times&rdquo;. It also&nbsp;includes a picture of an old-fashioned car and lines as if there were small words on the paper. He also includes the generic minifigure series stand.</p>

<p>Playability: The playability with this minifig is endless. You could send him on grand adventures or just keep him sitting in a chair reading the paper, it&#39;s up to you!</p>

<p>Minifig: The Grandpa was the first minifig to ever sport the comb over. Since then, it has been used on other&#39;s but none of the rocked it as much as him. His overalls look great on him and so does his bow tie, they really give him the old man look. The glasses and wrinkles on his face help with that too.</p>

<p>Value for Money:&nbsp;&pound;1.99 / $2.99 was the original cost for him and looking back that would be great if that was still what these figures cost. He includes 7 pieces and for that price it&#39;s not too bad for being in a minifig series.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall this is one of the best minifigures in not only series 10 but in all the other existing ones.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-04-23T21:02:59.27Z","revolutionary, but INCONSISTENT!","<p>The eighth figure in LEGO Minifigures Series 10 is Grandpa! This minifigure released in 2013, where he retailed for $2.99. He includes 7 pieces. Now let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top is that bald head piece, which just attaches at the top of the head using that stud. This piece was newly introduced for this minifigure, and it&#39;s been used a lot since then in new colours and whatnot. Now, when this piece was introduced, it was kind of criticised for its inconsistency with most LEGO Minifigs. Up until this point, bald LEGO figure&#39;s relied on a single, plain stud, so this figure really changed the game. I do think it&#39;s a little inconsistent with other figures, but it looks good, so I don&#39;t really have anything against it. The part itself looks pretty great! The smoothness on top looks a little weird, but it isn&#39;t bad, by any means. The moulded hair on the side is very nicely done, and that grey hair is printed, rather than dual moulded. That dark grey printing is carried on to the back of the head, and speaking of printing, there are a few strands of hair printed on the top of the smooth head as well.</p>

<p>The next thing to discuss is his head piece. Now, that piece looks a bit like the typical grandpa head from modern day LEGO City, but this piece is, indeed, exclusive to the figure. I dig that grumpy look, with the big, black glasses, as well as his large, bushy moustache. He has various wrinkles around the forehead and mouth, and he has no alternate expression, which is to be expected from a 2013 CMF.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which looks super fitting and frumpy. I dig the brown straps over the tan shirt, which has a Homer Simpson-like fat roll. I like the brown bow-tie, and the hiked up pants are scarily accurate. This figure sports some great back torso printing, which continues those brown straps that eventually merge into one single strap.</p>

<p>And since the legs don&#39;t have any printing, we can move on to the accessories. Side note, I think the muted colour combination works extremely well for this dude. Anyway, the first accessory is that white coffee cup, which is a very fitting accessory. My Grandpa tends to drink coffee almost every time he&#39;s over at my place, so I dig this inclusion. The second&nbsp;and more interesting accessory is that 2x2 tile print of a newspaper. I dig the choice of casting it in dark grey, and the &quot;OLD TIMES&quot; printing on it is very nicely done. The old-fashioned car printed in the small box is fantastic as well!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure! Overall, I understand this review was a little long, but there was&nbsp;a lot to say about this figure. This bad boy is very interesting, and I&#39;ll explain why: this head piece, and really the whole figure was revolutionary for its time, and for that, I&#39;m grateful. But looking back, this character doesn&#39;t really stand out from other LEGO City grandpas. I still really love the figure, and it&#39;s an incredible choice; it just isn&#39;t my favourite of the series. Either way, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a solid 4 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review! Stay safe, and thanks for reading!</p>
