<p>The paintball player has double-sided torso printing, leg printing and a single sided head. The printing is great, he's got numerous pockets, zippers and green paint everywhere, well almost everywhere. Despite being limited the back of the torso does include some printing and includes a big splotch of orange paint. Looks like his teammates have caused some friendly fire. The huge helmet has been seen in LEGO's Racers Theme, if I'm correct in my thinking, and he's got the white goggles seen on other Mini-Figs like Hoth Troopers.</p>
<p>His facial print shows that he's having a great time with a big tooth filled smile, and let's get on to the accessory, a brand new piece from LEGO it's a paintball gun. That's right, LEGO has introduced a new type of firearm, now all we need is a LEGO Paintball Arena set with a few more teammates for him.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is a pretty good offering from Series 10, the paintball gun is a great new accessory from LEGO and I hope we see it brought back. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3

<p>The paintball player is a figure i remember getting in 2013 and was my third of fourth CMF from that series and out of all series .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The helmet has some paint splodge prints in green , the goggles are in white , the head is very happy , the torso is quite nice but lacks back printing and the legs continue that print .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His accessory is an exclusive paint gun piece which is very cool . His stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very good fig with a fun accessory which has remained exclusive in mould for seven plus years i recommend it to anyone who is interested .&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2022-05-03T21:47:02.533Z","a ""MEH"" figure!","<p>The ninth minifigure in LEGO Minifigures Series 10 is the Paintball Player. This minifigure was released in 2013, where he included 7 pieces and retailed for $2.99. Series 10 is a series I&#39;ve personally never liked, so this should make for an interesting review. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Starting off the figure, we have that helmet, which is technically exclusive, thanks to that small lime green splotch atop the visor. I appreciate that small amount of&nbsp;detail, and I think that helmet piece may have been new for this CMF. Of course, the white goggles are clipped onto the sides of the helmet.</p>

<p>Underneath that helmet is his face, which has a pretty menacing expression. I feel like this dude is cracked at this sport, and from the looks of his snarling mouth, he takes this sport very seriously. I love how that face can be used in many other scenarios, and how it&#39;s also useful outside of this setting.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which does have some decent printing. I like the zipper that runs down centre of the torso, and there are also some pockets and a few splotches of green paint on the jacket. I really wish this CMF had side arm detailing, but none is implemented with this design. There is one, random splotch of orange paint on the back of the torso that I find comical, for some reason. It seems out of place, yet also somehow fitting!</p>

<p>Next are the legs, which do sport some swell printing. I really appreciate the pockets on the thighs, and the small green splotches of paint in a nonsymmetrical design&nbsp;look very fitting.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his&nbsp;accessory, which was introduced with this CMF, believe it or not. I really do love that piece, and I like various aspects of it, from the pole connection at front, to the small paint container attached to the bottom. The detail on that piece is pretty intricate, and it&#39;s actually my favourite piece on&nbsp;the figure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this minifigure! Overall, I appreciate this new paintball gun piece, but that&#39;s basically all I like about the figure. This CMF just doesn&#39;t really interest me, and even though it&#39;s not one of the worst in the series, it is one of my personal least favourites. At the end of the day, I&#39;m gonna give this figure a 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review! Thanks for reading, and stay safe!&nbsp;</p>
