<p>The Sea Captain has the standard LEGO Printing of a single-sided torso and a single-sided head, but he makes up for the less detailing by being quite smartly dressed and introducing us to a brand new head piece. All that's missing is a boat for him to Captain and LEGO City has you covered with their Harbor and Marina themed sets of the past few years. (Even the LEGO Creator Lighthouse would make a great set piece for this Mini-Fig.) There is also arm printing on each side, markings of his station.</p>
<p>The new Seagull piece is a softer plastic, more rubbery, with excellent printed detailing on the wings and head. And I'm hopeful we'll see this new hat piece re-used in future Mini-Figs and Theme sets. He also has a pair of binoculars, for spotting from the bridge of the ship. Overall I'd recommend hunting down one or two for the parts and one to keep as the grizzled old sea captain, feeling him out in the bags may be a bit trickier, as the seagull isn't so easy to figure out by feel alone.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3

But while he may seem bland at first, his parts are very good. I absolutely adore the peaked cap, which is a unique piece of headwear that has many more uses. The torso has great printed sleeves with gold braids to show his authority on the high seas. The seagull is made of a softer, flexible plastic, but is very detailed and overall looks good. The legs and binoculars are nothing special, simply the common black and white, but overall I believe the other unique pieces more than make up for it.",FALSE,5,5,3,3,4

This CMF was released way back in May of 2013, where it included&nbsp;7 pieces, and retailed for $2.99. Let&#39;s take a closer look at the figure, and then evaluate what my final verdict is!</p>

<p>Right off the bat, we&#39;re introduced to a brand new hat piece that was made exclusively for this figure. It&#39;s completely caste in white, and the shaping around the rim is especially detailed. The top is very smooth, and the front of the cap sports some great black printing with a single gold band stretched around. That all makes for a very nice hat piece!</p>

<p>Next is the head, which does have a good expression. I appreciate the scruffy grey beard, as well as his stern demeanour. He has no back facial printing, which is expected, considering it&#39;d be severely exposed due to that hat.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which sports some pretty fantastic detail! The front of his torso has that nice dark blue jacket that contrasts nicely with the tan undershirt. This character has no back torso printing, but the gold emblems on the arms are very unexpected, yet incredibly appreciated! I love when LEGO incorporates small, unnecessary details that add to the overall quality!</p>

<p>And since the legs are fittingly plain white without printing, we&#39;re gonna move right on to the accessories, two of which are included. Black binoculars are included here, and I personally love their inclusion, as it adds a lot to the figure. They&#39;re&nbsp;caste in black, which is nothing special, but still very appreciated. The second, most interesting accessory, is that seagull, which was yet another new part for the figure. That piece is absolutely incredible, and way ahead of its time. It&#39;s caste in white, rubbery plastic, and the moulded work on that part is splendid. It sports a small amount of printing, but some detail is incorporated on the beak and eyes. I think that seagull piece is one of my favourite parts in this entire series!</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, I&#39;m not a big fan of Series 10, as it&#39;s full of mediocre designs and characters. This figure, however, is definitely one of the highlights in the series. Not only does it introduce two&nbsp;amazing new elements, but the printing on the figure itself is fantastic, particularly on the arms and face. Overall, this CMF looks way ahead of its time, and&nbsp;I have to give the figure a 5 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review! Thanks for reading, and stay safe!</p>
