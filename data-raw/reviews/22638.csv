"Nesquik","2013-05-01T12:06:38.613Z","The Traditional Clown","Although Sad Clown is easily the more minimalist looking character of Series 10, the strength of his personality cannot be denied. This is a minifigure that can be appreciated for its origins; it is interesting to note that, despite being a <i>clown, </i>the present character harks back to the tradition of mime and empathy. It used to be the case that a 'clown' was the subject of a gag (becoming the victim of a joke), unlike today where the role is reversed and they have become the joker!&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The monochrome outfit is accurate to those traditional roots, and reflects the sad nature of the character. Despite the general simplicity of the printing, the overall effect is very striking and makes a nice pairing with the Mime Artist.&nbsp;Sad Clown features no accessories, although the unique hat piece more than makes up for this.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Though this character may not have been an obvious choice in a new series of collectable minifigures, it is a sophisticated addition that will absolutely stand out from the rest of your collection.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,3,4
"tkettle9719","2013-06-21T18:46:57.103Z","Mr. Mime... No, Wait, Not the Pokemon!","<p>I got this minifigure a few months ago, hoping to get either Medusa or the Grandpa (I could have made an amazing 11th Doctor figure, but, oh well...). This little mime is very interesting and bizarre, and his color scheme is even unique and displayed on the entire fig. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Some interesting parts are in here; I especially like the hat and the collar piece, which I', sure are going to be very rare in any color.<br></li><li>The color scheme is very oddball; yet, it works very well for this minifig, who I see certainly going into many a Lego City street. <br></li><li>Even the legs get some printing; the minifig is very good because it is simple, but little details like this don't detriment it at all. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I don't understand why the mime would be sad; I mean, sure, it could be, but why have the tear in? It feels very out-of-place. <br></li><li>A lack of accessories also puts this a little lower in my list; I would have given him something to maybe juggle with. <br></li><li>I sort of wish that the white was only on the cheeks instead of his entire face; I think it would certainly give this figure another layer of detail. <br></li></ul>
<p>This figure is very interesting, and its color scheme is polarizing. However, the details here are just a bit too few, making this the Crash Test Dummy fig. I still like it, but a small amount more substance would propel this to ingenuity. I recommend this, but not for casuals. <br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2013-08-03T15:25:05.907Z","The Incosolable One","<p><strong>Set #71001 Sad Clown:</strong> This Mini-Figure is sheer brilliance, bravo LEGO for bringing him to the LEGO Collectible Mini-Figures line. Now all we need is a Female Clown and the entire Clown Family can be complete.</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure is all black and white, a first for Mini-Figs. He's got a new conical shaped hat with front printing of the black pom-pom things and a black rim all around it. The chest printing is sublimely simple in its design, with matching black pom-poms or buttons the big fuzzy kind and nothing else. He's also got black lines printed on his legs to represent, I'm guessing, the trim of some jacket he's wearing which trails down to just above his knees.</p>
<p>Re-using the Actor's frill neck-piece in this form is pretty clever. And his facial print is just perfect, one stray tear, frowning lips and that's about it. Overall I'd strongly recommend this Mini-Fig for your collection, he may not be the best for playing with, however what he represents is just great. We're already seeing the new hat re-used with the Series 11 Santa Elf or Holiday Elf, but I doubt it'll end there.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3

<p>The sad clown in my opinion is a bland&nbsp;figure from another wise fairly good&nbsp; CMF series .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has a hat which never came in another set with printing ontop , a white head with a crying expression , a black collar neck attachment , a simplistic torso and legs of the same style .</p>

<p>The stand -&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is an alright figure with nothing particularly interesting so I don&#39;t really recommend it .</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-04T18:50:43.6Z","a bit of a sad figure!","<p>The eleventh minifigure found in LEGO Minifigures Series 10 is the Sad Clown. This CMF was released back in 2013, where it included 6 pieces, and retailed for $2.99. Back when I first took a look at Series 10, I despised this figure. That, however, was several years ago, so perhaps my opinion of him changed. Let&#39;s take a closer look, and find out!</p>

<p>On top, we have that conical hat piece, which I believe was designed exclusively for this figure. I really love how that piece is moulded, with the profound tip at the top. Those black pompoms are printed, as is the black lip around the rim. That printing goes all around that piece, which is pretty cool for 2013.</p>

<p>Next is the face, which appears to be rather sad. I do appreciate how it&#39;s all done in white, and how the eyes, mouth, and tear is&nbsp;printed in black.&nbsp;That&#39;s a pretty expressive face print, so the fact that he lacks back printing is expected. Plus, it&#39;d be severely exposed due to that hat.</p>

<p>Next is his ruffle, which attaches at the neck. That piece is a very clever re-use of the Series 8 Actor&#39;s neck frill, so seeing it here is definitely very welcome.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which has some very basic printing that sort of works, for me personally. Those 3, basic, fluffy pompoms are printed evenly, and I love how the printing pattern is the same on those as it is on the hat. He does not have any back torso printing.</p>

<p>Next are the legs, which sport a fair amount of printing. I really love that black wave affect that carries on to all 3 segments of the legs, and I appreciate the fact he has printing on there&nbsp;at all.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the figure! All&nbsp;in all, I have problems with it. First off, I feel like the choice of making another CMF clown is kind of bad, considering we got a clown in Series 1, and then again in Series 5. I do think this is an interesting take on the trope, though. Even though the figure introduces a new piece, I can&#39;t help but feel like he&#39;s a little bit plan, purposeful or not. At the end of the day, I don&#39;t dislike this figure as much as I once did, and it&#39;s far from my least favourite in the series. However, I&#39;m gonna have to give him a 3 out of 5, just because it&#39;s sort of an overused concept.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review! Thanks for reading, and stay safe!</p>
