"Shistavanen_brick","2013-06-03T06:41:28.51Z","Free tea for the 13 brick-colonies.","This was quite an interesting choice for a minifigure, a guy that is willing to defend the rights of the 13 (brick-) colonies - following the wake of the Boston Tea Party in the 1700's. He does look like a minifig-version of George Washington, which may be intentional from LEGO's side.&nbsp;<h4>The figure.</h4><div><b>Head:</b></div><div>Nothing special, just a regular stern face that can be expected from a revolutionary soldier. The head-peice, however, is a hair-peice that reminds me of the Pirates of the Caribbean series a few years ago. It's a white hair/wig-piece with a small blue bow in the back.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Torso:</b></div><div>I really like that it is printed on both sides. He has a blue army coat and underneath, a nice old style red vest with shiny buttons. Across the coat are white breeches that marks an ""X"", giving him a great look.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Legs:</b></div><div>Normal minifigure white legs, no more can be said.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Accessories:</b></div><div>I am not fully impressed with his boom-box, or musket. It has been re-used before and for a Collectable Minifigure series, you kind of expect something more. Previous series have given us new and sometimes impressive new accessories. To name a few; a <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8804-8"">hockey stick</a>, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=8827-14"">steak</a>, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=71000-1"">tray</a> and not to mention the spear you get with many warrior minifigures.</div><div><br></div><div>So why not giving us a cooler musket? Or something to go along the one we DO get would suffice. Not just an old musket that has been around for a long time. I guess it's cheaper though.</div><div><br></div><div>Pros:</div><div><ul><li>Not too bad of a minifigure.</li><li>Unlike many others, this had backprinting too.</li></ul></div><div>Cons:</div><div><ul><li>We should have another musket.</li></ul></div>",TRUE,3,1,1,2,1
"Harmonious_Building","2013-06-25T08:58:37.55Z","You say you want a revolutionary? ","Considering the size of LEGO's (North) American market, it's high time that the world historical Collectible Minifigs ventures into American history - apart from certain stereotypical depictions of <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Western&amp;subtheme=Indians"">Native Americans</a>. Indeed, it's hard to get more iconic than this George Washington lookalike, and I would be highly dubious if one told me that LEGO created the Revolutionary Soldier without the first American president's look firmly in mind.<div><br></div><div>Unfortunately, while the depiction is more than satisfactory overall and certainly gives an excellent flavour of the time, there is precious little that is terribly ""collectible"" about the Revolutionary Soldier. His head is fairly generic, a sort of yellow version of the typical ""scowl"" that comes on a lot of heads from licensed themes, albeit in flesh tones. The pants are straight white, which I guess is appropriate for the depiction but disappointing from the collector's point of view. The rifle is exactly the same as the same one that LEGO belligerents have been packing for decades. The two true unique parts to the Revolutionary Soldier would be his handsomely printed torso, which is of inimitably high quality, as always, and his hairpiece, the ol' powdered wig from times gone by.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><i>Civilization </i>nuts like myself with doubtlessly be pleased to find another historical world leader clone in LEGO form to join his friend the Roman Emperor (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=71000-5"">71000-5</a>) and others. Those who are less historically inclined, however, might find the Revolutionary Soldier's lack of new parts to be, well, somewhat less revolutionary than expected.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,1
"Odeinoichus","2013-08-03T15:45:06.01Z","The Patriot","<p><strong>Set #71001 Revolutionary Soldier: </strong>What can I say about this Mini-Figure that others haven't already touched upon?</p>
<p>Honestly I'm not too thrilled with him, I mean perhaps it's because I'm not American, but he does fill another slot of Historical Mini-Figures we haven't gotten before so there is that. The new wig piece seems to me to be what everyone is going crazy for and I just don't get it, it has rather limited re-use potential. Outside of period piece Mini-Figs you really can't do much with it, so kids may find it a bit less impressive.</p>
<p>Adult fans are going to enjoy it a bit more, depending on the adult, as I said I'm a bit meh on the guy and only really bought one to fill that slot in my Collectible Mini-Figure checklist. The printing is superbly crafted and designed, he's got a double-sided torso and a single sided face. Really out of all the Mini-Figs Series 10 I think has the least amount with double-sided heads. If you're a fan you'll want him, if you're a historical character buff you'll want him. Kids may or may not be as interested in this character as some of the other, more fun looking ones. Mildly recommended for completist sake.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3
"sideswinger","2022-09-04T18:51:08.31Z","great hair, but a NOT-SO-GREAT figure!","<p>The twelfth minifigure in LEGO Minifigures Series 10 is the Revolutionary Soldier. This figure released in 2013, where it retailed for $2.99, and included 6 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that iconic, white hair piece, which strongly resembles the first US President, George Washington. It sports some great moulded detail around the sides, where it curls up into itself. The greebling on&nbsp;top is very intricate, and I like the small pony-tail at the back.</p>

<p>Next up, we have his head, which sports a fairly good face print. I like how unamused he looks, as it captures the aesthetic of the character very nicely. He has no alternate expression, however.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which again, sports a fairly good print. I do dig the red trim on the dark blue jacket, as well as the gold buttons printed along it. Surprisingly enough, this dude includes some back torso detail, which continues&nbsp;the white straps.</p>

<p>His legs are plain white, fittingly, so we&#39;re gonna discuss his accessory, that being his rifle, or musket. I do appreciate its inclusion, but it isn&#39;t anything new or exclusive. In fact, it&#39;s been around for quite some time! Nonetheless, it&#39;s very fitting.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this minifig! This is a character I used to really love, and whenever I viewed images of the&nbsp;series, this figure stood out to me. But to be honest, my love of him has sort of waned. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the hair piece is spectacular, and this figure accurately represents its concept, admittedly. But I think it would&#39;ve benefited LEGO if they would&#39;ve just scrapped this concept, and came up with something new, considering this trope doesn&#39;t leave much room for detailing. At the end of the day, I&#39;m gonna have to give him a generous 3&nbsp;out of 5. The hair piece is great, but that&#39;s no excuse to laze off the rest of the figure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review! Stay safe, and thanks for reading!&nbsp;</p>
