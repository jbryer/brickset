This is the only one I really like, because it has some parts which are very, very useful.<div><br></div><h4>Parts</h4><div>There are a lot of useful parts in this set, which is why I gave it it's rating. The best parts are the trailer, (very useful), two parts which go well with Alpha Team-Mission Deep Sea, the exhaust pipe, the bumper, the chain, and the wheels. Otherwise, there's not much to it.</div><h4>Building and Playing</h4><p>Not much to say. It's very playable, like all 4 Juniors sets but it's not very good. Building is so easy I could do it with my feet and one eye closed.</p><h4>Overall</h4><h4>Pros</h4><div><ul><li>Some nice parts</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4></div><div><ul><li>It's way too expensive for the number of parts</li><li>Why don't they have normal minifigures?</li><li>Juniorized to the max</li></ul><div>Again, unless you are building a juniorized town, probably not worth it.</div></div>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,1

I still use it dues to its stability and to its ability to rebuild.<h4>Pros:</h4><div><ul><li>Good colours!</li><li>Easy to&nbsp;rebuild!</li><li>Rare chain part!</li><li>Strong/Stable construction!</li></ul></div><h4>Cons:</h4><div>Very simple minifigures.</div><div>Too easy to build!</div><h4>Overall:</h4><p>This wasn't a good set, nor a bad set. Obviously it is so easy to build, but this gives it the&nbsp;ability to rebuild easily into something else. There are some rare parts/parts that I really like in this set, like the silver-coloured exhaust&nbsp;pipes.</p><p>Overall, this is a nice and&nbsp;stable&nbsp;set, but don't get it if you want to make a hard-to-build collection!</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,3,3
