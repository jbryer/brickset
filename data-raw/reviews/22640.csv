"Odeinoichus","2013-07-29T19:26:25.463Z","The Outfielder","<p><strong>Set #71001 Baseball Fielder:</strong> In Series 3 we had a Baseball Player who included a new Baseball Bat piece, now we've got an outfielder for a different team with a new Baseball Glove replacement for the hand. Left handed only.</p>
<p>The print detail for the Baseball Fielder is gray and blue, a single sided torso with the team name of Stackers. (Compared to the Clutchers from before.) The hat is familiar by now, in a nice matching gray and white with a blue S for the team logo. The facial print is also single sided and a bit typical of LEGO City facial prints. Nothing truly stands out for him. No leg printing on this figure.</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this figure is decent, you're going to want him I'm sure especially for the glove which can be removed and replaced on any Mini-Figure's arm so you can have different outfielders with different outfits. The only thing missing is a baseball, perhaps if LEGO gives us a Catcher in a later series for behind the plate they'll include a brand new baseball piece that fits in the glove. (Maybe even a right handed glove for diversity.) Strongly Recommended.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,3,4

<p>The baseball fielder is fine , but I just can&#39;t bring myself to enjoy any non walking sports in reality and the Lego realm is no different .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has a printed hat , a generic expression , an alright torso with no back printing , a baseball glove which I suppose is good and some plain legs with him printing .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>In my opinion this is a fairly uninteresting figure from a genre of professions that wouldn&#39;t be a stretch for me to say that I hate so I don&#39;t recommend it .</p>

But is it as good as the original?</p>

<p>This character was released way back in May 2013, where it&nbsp;retailed for only $2.99. It includes 5 pieces, which is one less than most CMF&#39;s, but still acceptable. Now let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top, we have that cap. That piece was introduced with the original Baseball Player, and that is no cap. I love the light grey colour used for it, and the printed detail on the front does a great job of differentiating it from the original Baseball Player figure.</p>

<p>There really isn&#39;t too much going on with this characters face, but I do appreciate how it&#39;s exclusive. The generic expression could be useful for stop motion movies and whatnot, which is a hobby I am personally into.</p>

<p>Torso-wise, this guy is pretty good! I enjoy how the torso is still similar to the Series 3 figure, while also making itself known that it&#39;s a different team. The&nbsp;blue and grey&nbsp;colour scheme works beautifully, as do the blue arms. I do wish this figure had back torso printing, but that&#39;s not a big deal. Of course, the best part of this entire figure is that brown glove, which looks pretty phenomenal! The moulded detail on the fingers, however inconsistent it is with standard mini figure hands, looks great, and it certainly fills me with childhood nostalgia of playing out-field.</p>

<p>Although the detail on the legs is sparse, I dig the black belt on the waist, which is pretty useful.</p>

<p>And since this figure has no accessories, that is it for the character! Overall, I would give this figure a solid 4 out of 5! I like how it&#39;s different enough from the Series 3 Baseball Player to stand out, and that glove on the hand really tops it off for me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Stay safe, and thanks for reading!</p>
