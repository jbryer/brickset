Case in point let's discuss the Trendsetter.</p>
<p>She's blonde, she's carrying an I-Phone and she comes with a Chiuaua, she's The Trendsetter and she's going to feature some neat parts. Not only do you get a brand new LEGO dog different from what's found in LEGO Themes, but you also have a unique new hair piece (which I hope we see re-used in brown and red in futuer series.) that has some great sculpt work. Accessory-wise she doesn't offer much if you aren't looking for new LEGO animals, but the I-Phone printed 1x2 tile is one step closer to having a new LEGO piece made.</p>
<p>Her print is single-sided for the torso and head, she's got a really long pearl necklace and a heart shaped pendant necklace on, her shirt also has a bow on the right breast for some odd reason. Or perhaps it's a pin. She's wearing large black shades with a tiny heart on one side. Has big red ruby lips and leg printing with more chains and a star patterned belt.</p>
<p>Overall this new Mini-Figure is a great addition for fans of female Mini-Figures, however she is a bit harder to track through the cases compared to most of the others. In point of fact because of how tricky it is to feel out her hairpiece or the dog you might wind up with a lot more of the other characters before you find her, only putting two of this figure in every case was not the best idea honestly. Still highly recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3
"Studded_Dud","2020-08-02T19:42:45.19Z","Trend Set","<p>Parts: The minifigure includes 7 total pieces. First of which is the dog. The dog is unique and has printing for it&#39;s eye&#39;s, mouth, and nose. It is able to sit on top of a stud. The minifigure includes the standard head, body, and feet. The hair looks great on the figure and it can be used on many other custom figures. The phone is also printed and looks just like you would expect a trendsetter&#39;s phone to look like.</p>

<p>Playability: The playability is endless with this figure and dog. She fits in where ever she needs to.</p>

<p>Value For Money: It originally cost&nbsp;&pound;1.99 / $2.99, which would be great if they still cost that now. It includes 7 pieces and fits right in with any city.</p>

<p>Minifig: She includes blonde hair that was original for the figure, in other words she set that trend. Her head is one sided and shows her &ldquo;looking cool&rdquo; with sunglass&nbsp;and a smirk. Her torso is&nbsp;striped white and pink. She has a heart necklace and a bow. Her legs are printed showing a belt and some chains. All necessary things for her to be in with the trends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: Overall this minifigure has printed pieces everywhere wanted, and she does her job by fitting in where ever she is put.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-04T21:00:40.37Z","does it HOLD UP?","<p>The fourteenth character in LEGO Minifigures Series 10 is the Trendsetter. This figure was released back in 2013, where it included 7 pieces and retailed for only $2.99 in US dollars. This was among the most popular figures upon release, so let&#39;s see if it still holds up.</p>

<p>Ok, so on top of the minifigure is a brand new hair piece - at least it&nbsp;<em>was&nbsp;</em>brand new. It has since been used multiple times since then in various colours and themes. I find its introduction interesting here, seeing as this figure has - spoiler alert- a new piece already, with that doggo. It&#39;s fantastic to see not one, but two new pieces here. Anyway, the design of that hair-piece looks like it was meant to represent 2013&#39;s version of a Karen, and I guess it does its job. I like the brief moulded detail on the back, and I think LEGO made a good choice casting it in spring yellow, AKA blonde.</p>

<p>Next is the head, which I feel like was also meant to represent a Karen. The black sunglasses, or shades, sport some good reflection detail, and her small smirk is somewhat menacing, for some reason. She sports no back facial printing.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which has some pretty great printing. I&#39;m not sure if it would really stand out in a pile of generic LEGO City torso&#39;s, but I guess this character is supposed to be a normal civilian, so all good there. I like the silver heart necklace, as well as the pink and white stripes behind it. She has no back torso printing, but that&#39;s okay, since the hair covers most of it anyway,</p>

<p>Next are her legs, which actually have&nbsp;some good printing. I appreciate the black belt, and I like how the silver chains contrast with the white base. There is no side printing, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>And lastly, we have her accessories, both of which I find absolutely incredible. Not only does she have the doggo, but she includes a 1x2 print of a phone. Now given the iPhone 5 released in late September 2012, I think it&#39;s reasonable to conclude that this tile is based off&nbsp;that design. I adore phones in LEGO, and they were fairly hard to get back when this released. I like the various icons, which look to be a settings app, a health app, and perhaps a messaging app. I really love the notch at the top, and the home button on the bottom makes it clear that this is supposed to resemble an older iPhone model. Now moving on, this character also incudes a doggo, which was, no doubt, the most popular part of the figure when this released. It was a brand new piece introduced with this figure, and it&#39;s funny to think that Chihuahuas were trendy back then. And yes, this is clearly meant to represent a short-haired breed, and it reminds me of my cousins old dog, even down to the dark nougat colouring.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, I used to really dislike this; but all things considered, my opinion on it has drastically changed. Not only does it have some excellent printed pieces, particularly that phone, but getting two new moulds, one of which isn&#39;t even necessary, is something I find extremely generous and appreciated. Heck, I have no idea why I ever disliked this minifigure, because as much as I dislike Series 10, this is an amazing character. 5 out of 5.</p>

<p>That is it for this review. Stay safe, and thanks for reading!</p>
