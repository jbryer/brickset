I've chosen to review the figures who haven't recieved any yet through Brickset's users base.</p>
<p>The Decorator fills in another new slot from the long list of careers typically found in a LEGO City that never appear in sets. He introduces a brand new accessory piece as well, the roller piece for his painting tool. He also has the new pail piece in light gray and the plumber's hat from Series 9 in white.</p>
<p>His torso print is double-sided with a shirt or sweatshirt in plain gray protected by coveralls, there's a lot of fine detail work here with splotches of blue paint everywhere, some so small as to almost be missed such as the blue splotches on the back of his left shoulder strap. The front of his legs are also covered in paint splotches, and he's even got one on his cheek, as painting walls among other things can be very messy work. The facial print however is sort of bland, typical of male figures from LEGO City Theme sets. It isn't quite unique or stand outish.</p>
<p>Overall the Decorator fills another niche in the LEGO Mini-Figures collection of many fans, someone to help paint all of LEGO City after it's been built. The new roller piece allows you to attach any color of cylinder pieces to represent any LEGO colors, the use of a rare teal colored cylinder with him is pretty impressive. Strongly reccomend tracking a few down to populate LEGO City with more diverse characters.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

I often picked up a paint brush myself, but always yielded bad results. I was never much of an artist. However, when my family and I painted my house white, I got a chance at a paint roller, and to be quite honest, I got the hang of it, despite getting paint all over my clothes, shoes, and grass. The Decorator, a minifigure from LEGO Minifigures Series 10, reminds me of those days, and invokes some nostalgia in me. This character includes 7 pieces, and he retailed for $2.99 US dollars.</p>

<p>On top of the figure is that white cap piece. That part was introduced with the Series 9 Plumber, but&nbsp;if I&#39;m not mistaking, this was the first time we got that piece in white. I love that design for a hat, and it is, for some reason, very fitting.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which is yet another great piece. I like the small stubble around his smirk, and the blue splotch of paint on his face is a nice touch. Now he doesn&#39;t have an alternate expression, but that&#39;s understandable since it&#39;d be severely exposed by that hat.</p>

<p>Next is the torso, which is a really nice print that I can see being used very frequently outside of this series. I like the blue splotch on the overalls, and he has some really nice back torso printing, which carries on the white overalls.</p>

<p>Finishing off the minifigure itself, we have his legs, which are surprisingly detailed. I love the blue splotches on the waist, legs, and feet, all of which look fantastic.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessories, all of which have new pieces. As seen in the image here on Brickset, he includes a paint roller, and despite it being very common nowadays, it was a new mould for this figure. I really love that mould, and I like the 1x1 round brick attached via the pole connection. Though it is not shown on the image, this figure includes a can of paint, and while I don&#39;t believe the pail itself was new for the figure, it was a relatively new piece in 2013. The pail is caste in light grey, and a handle piece is also included. I find the inclusion of a paint roller as well as a paint pail very completive!</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, we&#39;ve got so many painters in LEGO City since this released, all having a similar white overall and grey shirt colour combination, and most of which use a paint roller and a paint can. I originally thought this figure was a really bad and repetitive design, until I realised that this was virtually the first painter to have this appearance. I love the new paint roller piece included here, and it was a really original figure back in the day. Had this released in the most recent series, I would&#39;ve given it about a 2. But since this released back in 2013, I&#39;ll give it a solid 4 out of 5!</p>

<p>That is it for this review! Thanks for reading, and stay safe!</p>
