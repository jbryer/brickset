"tkettle9719","2013-06-21T19:16:14.79Z","Counting Cars... (Or Motorcycles)","<p>I got this set, along with what I call the Mime, a few months ago and have just found the time to write a review for it. What we have here is a very detailed minifig who looks very accurate to the stereotype, and has a look similar to something Danny Koker (the main man in History Channel's <i>Counting Cars</i>) would wear. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The bandana piece on top is a simple touch; however, it is very significant to the figure, which greatly benefits from this and the wrench. <br></li><li>My goodness, the printing is even on the arms now!! This is very impressive, in my opinion, and once again packs a punch in the detail department. <br></li><li>The clothing is also very detailed, along with the face; this all creates one fantastic minifigure that stands out in any collection. <br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>I sort of wish that the toolbox from the car mechanic were present; not that it matters too much, but it would have been nice to get. <br></li><li>The flame tattoo printing is also on one arm, making this seem a bit awkward, in my opinion. It still looks really nice, but overall it's awkward. <br></li><li>The one detail which disturbs me here is the back of the jacket; the skull is childish (Yes, Lego is a toy company, but it can also have a tiny bit less cheesiness for its adult crowd). The skull belt looks fine, however. <br></li></ul>
<p>This figure is great and really works, generally. However, some mixed results with the minifig detailing make this a bit more reserved than I'd like. I recommend this for any city fan with a lot of motorcycles (a garage full of 'em), but be warned of its cartooniness. <br></p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,4

<p>That's correct this is the Motorcycle Mechanic, a Mini-Figure of a dangerous looking biker dude, who's got a heart of gold apparently. The print on this Mini-Figure is classic biker look, he's got a tattered looking vest with a skull and wrenches symbol on his back (double-sided print on the torso here.), his legs feature printing with chains and an oily rag hanging out of his front pocket and he has a flame tatoo printed on his left arm. His face is single-sided sporting mirror shades, a scruffy beard and&nbsp;a styling mustache.</p>
<p>Overall he's a great looking Mini-Figure who only truly suffers from a lack of unique accessories, the wrench he comes with is standard LEGO Black, and he's wearing the red bandana head piece introduced long ago in the LEGO Pirates Theme. Still this print is pure magic and a definite must have Mini-Fig even if he does have plain accessories. I recommend tracking one down at least, others would make good parts figures for customs. I also think that this Mini-Figure is the first one to have chest hair in the print, though I could be wrong about that.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3

<p>The motorcycle mechanic is a bland figure with a dull accessory but a nice arm print .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has a red bandana , a moustached face with sunglasses , a fine torso , barely printed legs and a flame tattoo arm print .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His only accessory is a really cool rench in black (sarcasm) . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a very bland figure but with a nice arm print and a bad accessory so I barely recommend it for one arm print .</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-06T00:18:58.033Z","all BAD???","<p>Series 10 has always been, and I presume always will be, one of my least favourite LEGO Minifigure Series&#39; ever. While it has a few solid figures, most are mediocre at best, while some are downright plain and boring. Thus, we have the last minifigure in Series 10, with the exception of Mr. Gold: the Motorcycle Mechanic. This figure was widely regarded as being the worst in the series back in 2013, and I can see why. But is it really completely bad? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>Starting off the figure is that red bandanna. Now even in 2013, that was a relatively old piece, dating back to the LEGO Pirates line. This would be great to get if it was caste in a new colour, but sadly, it is not. That isn&#39;t a big deal, though, since it does feel appropriate.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which for some reason looks slightly un-LEGO like. I still appreciate the detailing and shading on the sunglasses and moustache, as well as the small stubble around his mouth. He has no alternate expression, which is understandable, since it&#39;d be criminally exposed.</p>

<p>Next is his torso and arms, which may be my favourite part of the figure. The torso itself has that great denim blue jacket, which uses a sick sand blue tone, and the back printing on this figure is pretty excellent, where we have that skull. I do really appreciate that small touch! But the torso is easily outshined by that great printing on the arm... yes, I said arm. As in singular. For some reason his right arm has no printing whatsoever, which is such a missed opportunity by LEGO. The left arm still has that fantastic flame tattoo, though, which looks spectacular.</p>

<p>His legs actually have some small but appreciated detailing, like the skull belt, and the greasy rag sticking out from his pocket. The silver chain looks good as well, but it doesn&#39;t carry on to the side, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessory, which is severely boring. It&#39;s nothing but a plain black wrench, which is so easy to get, and LEGO really couldn&#39;t have picked a more boring piece.</p>

<p>That is it for the figure! Overall, while the concept of a Motorcycle Mechanic is interesting enough to freshen up the mechanic trope used in Series 6, this figure isn&#39;t exactly perfect. Great concepts don&#39;t always equal great figures, even if they&#39;re executed nicely. Here, I think the motorcycle mechanic trope is executed pretty well, but it still makes for a relatively boring minifigure. And LEGO didn&#39;t exactly add an interesting accessory to spruce things up. So at the end of the day, while this isn&#39;t the worst, it&#39;s probably my second least favourite of this series, and I&#39;m only gonna give him a 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for my review. Thanks for reading, and stay safe!</p>
