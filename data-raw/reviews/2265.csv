The chrome muffler is cool. Few pieces to this set and my litte boy love pulling over the other cars in Lego town with this motorcycle cop. If you have young one or Jack Stone &amp; 4 Junior sets this is a set you should think about adding to your town.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's cool, but it's really lacking in some aspects. The cool is mostly just juniorization.<h4>Pros</h4><div><ul><li>It's got a nice exhaust pipe piece</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4></div><div><ul><li>Juniorized</li><li>One of the worst part values for price<br>Large Figure</li></ul><div>I would not recommend this set unless you aim to make a town in large figure scale. Then it may actually be useful.</div></div>",TRUE,3,2,1,4,2

You found it now. The pieces are almost the same as the police motor cycle wich is now n stores. Every year there is somesthing like this. You can build it easy. that's good for children who are 5/ 7 years old, and the pieces are big so they can't eat it but i think the figure is not so nice. the helmet makes the figure look angry. It looks like a villian. Not like a brave policeman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>conclusion:</p>
<p>The set is not nice if you are 10/13</p>
<p>but if you are 5/ 7 it's very nice</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,5,3
