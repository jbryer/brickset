<p>I&#39;m writing this review as someone new to this studless style of building, the last Technic set I had was the pneumatic claw truck, 8868. Do bear that in mind as I describe the general build - I&#39;d always thought studless was heresy (see the brilliant cartoon at the end of Hispabricks issue 17)!</p>

<p>This review should be useful to anyone else in my position drawn by the extra temptations in this set, which are many!</p>

<p>(Do check out the reviews of 9398 for considered reviews of the mechanics involved by people who have kept up with Technic styles and techniques, and how this compares to other similar models or vehicles with similar sections.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>To introduce the set</strong>, 41999 is of course the highly desirable and limited edition result of the &quot;You Design It, We Make It&quot; competition. RM88&#39;s bodywork on top of the 9398 chassis (from 2012) was the clear winner, and so is this set. The bodywork looks like it belongs with the huge suspension and wheels and looks like a highly modified muscle car with attitude.</p>

<p><strong>The exclusive features</strong> that make this set desirable are <strong>exclusive parts</strong>, the beautiful dark blue and &#39;silvered&#39; pieces made specially for it. The wheel rims have exclusive detailing and look just right for the set in black with a white line where the tyre meets the rim. And the vehicle <strong>compared to 9398</strong> is exactly the same price but with 250+ more pieces, significantly a winch system that 9398 didn&#39;t have so it has an extra motor, as well as lights.</p>

<p>But the feature that drew me to it in the shop was the way it is presented - the box is beautiful and almost alluring(!), with a frosted sort of finish and no pictures on the front but just the dark-blue-with-speed-stripes teasing your curiosity! The large Lego Technic logo tells you this is a special, flagship set, and the cleanness of the box calls you to look and find out why.</p>

<p>And that one little something that made me buy it was the exclusive printed number plate - each set is uniquely numbered out of the 20,000 set run (I got number 18,542). The number is prefixed by EK, and one of the sticker decals says &quot;Egor design&quot; so I presume RM88 is called Egor and his surname begins with K. The exclusive touches continue into the box too, with an array of signatures printed on one of the inside walls.<br />
The box promises that exclusive feel and boy does the set deliver!</p>

<p>For many people I imagine that will be enough, buying this set as <strong>an investment</strong>. (I&#39;m following one eBay auction that started at 99p and it up to &pound;142 with 6 days still to run!) That was a large factor in my purchase, though I hope I don&#39;t ever have to sell it and I definitely wanted to open, build and display it. It wasn&#39;t just the exclusivity that convinced me, it was everything the set had to offer combined with that chance to own a little piece of history in some small way that made my mind up.</p>

<p>If you were to purchase this as a nest egg, on top of the usual sacrifices a collector makes when (s)he buys a set and never opens it (not getting to see the model and all it can do) one extra drawback of this set is you can&#39;t ever know the set number that&#39;s printed on the 2x4 tile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>So, onto the actual model itself!</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>first part</strong> of <strong>the build</strong>, which is split into just two bags, is the chassis, which as far as I can tell is identical to that of 9398 (or at least the competition required it to be, so it shouldn&#39;t be too different!). This is probably the least enjoyable part of the set. It is quite galling when you realise part way through building the second of the, er, axle pieces (?) that they are identical - you could have doubled your work and avoided that feeling of futile deja-vu.</p>

<p>Everything is very compact and very well reinforced and you&#39;re not far into the build before you start to feel how chunky and heavy duty it is. The build is also quite straightforward; there&#39;s barely a piece in the whole model that&#39;s not at a straight or right angle, most pieces line up against a standard grid so there&#39;s not much chance of confusion over placement. There are only a few steps where you are distracted by a big build and miss something small too.</p>

<p>I imagine it&#39;s a common enough technique too, but I was intrigued by the way pieces are added to keep the build rigid and later removed. It works well, but I was intrigued by the connectors that were totally unused and unnecessary in the bracing that you put in carefully only to later pull apart!</p>

<p>The drive motors are mounted directly to the axle units so the only thing that needs transferring to the units is the steering - all four wheels steer so the drive from the motor mounted in the centre is sent to both ends through the ball joints (I suppose the only way to have the engine in the &#39;proper&#39; place would be to have front wheel steering and rear wheel drive - or a bigger channel through the ball joint!). The ball joints give each unit completely free articulation so the wheels can move quite freely over uneven terrain and normally be in contact with the ground (there are arms on ball joints limiting the movement, but in reality that&#39;s all done by the suspension, they&#39;re entirely cosmetic).</p>

<p>Within the units the wheels have a chunky differential meaning they can turn at different rates around corners (and so you can free wheel it tilted sideways on two wheels). And the means of transmitting the drive to the wheels through the steering joints, which are heavy duty, is good.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing all that mind blowing in any of that, but it took me back to building 8868 in my teens and discovering what differentials were and why they were necessary. Good memories!</p>

<p>I wonder if this point (before you add the suspension) would be a good one to add the wheels at; the motors keep the wheels from turning so it would make the model a bit more &#39;grabbable&#39; as you build.</p>

<p>Adding the suspension was a treat for me as I never had a set that had it when I was younger. And it&#39;s the first point since building the central unit (with the motor that provides the steering in it) that the build hasn&#39;t been symmetrical front to back. The units are slightly different because the front one will have the winch attached to it and the back on has the IR sensor mounted to it. The remote-control-car-like clip above the battery unit is quite cute, and this part of the build is finished by adding the winch control and the lights.</p>

<p>The <strong>second part </strong>of <strong>the build</strong> begins with the winch with the first of the &#39;silvered&#39; pieces (not as bright as chrome, nice and understated), and the winch unit ends up including the entire front end of the vehicle so the first of the dark blue pieces goes on too. The entire unit is bolted on and then gradually integrated. The bodywork down the sides of the car is built anticlockwise so you start on the front left wing and end on the front right! It is a mixture of bodywork that is just attached and further strengthening of the chassis, getting taller and taller. But when you&#39;ve added the doors (I love the way the rubber pieces keep the doors closed) it still feels like the finish is a long way off.</p>

<p>The entire central section, bonnet to spoiler, is one unit that lifts up (the doors have a notch that comes over the frame to hold it down. As such I hesitate to pick it up by its roof as that would put a lot of strain on just a few pieces). It looks brilliant and I think is true to monster trucks in real life, but it meant I almost didn&#39;t realise when I&#39;d finished building! (of course I noticed ther epieces were running out, it just didn&#39;t feel like it!)</p>

<p>What I especially like about this build is that it uses a lot of large panels and doesn&#39;t have the framework look that a lot of Technic models have. In the old, studded days you could add Lego bricks to build up around the Technic frame. My big gripe with the look of the new studless style is that it&#39;s beams with weird curved panels that look flumsy, and you can&#39;t add Lego pieces to make up for it. You can tell this model is basically an MOC because it looks properly solid. I hope Lego designers take a cue from it!</p>

<p>A few<strong> little bits </strong>about <strong>the build </strong>are worth a mention:</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of stickers, but I&#39;d say they&#39;re pretty good. I applied the triangular stickers at the point with a 1mm-ish gap, made sure it ran straight along the bottom edge, and the smoothed it rubbing along the long line, moving upwards. They all applied very easily and straight. The stickers on the &#39;boot&#39; lid were easy enough too. I started the larger ones on one of the panel&#39;s long edges, and pressed the sticker into the grooves one by one, pulling the far end of it slightly back in. Again, they all went on fine with no real difficulty. (And I especially like them because the car number is 83 - I wonder if EK was born in the same year as me?)</p>

<p>I was a little disappointed by the actual printed &quot;x out of 20,000&quot; tile too. For some reason the blank 2x4 tile that you can put the &quot;EK 41999&quot; sticker on comes in bag 1, so I was worrying that this was it, just a sticker and the set wasn&#39;t numbered after all. And when I opened the many bag 2s and found the printed part it did seem quite poorly printed too, as if the printing was lighter or faded in the middle. Perhaps that&#39;s just that it&#39;s printed in silver but it felt like a real shame.</p>

<p>The only &#39;real&#39; Lego bricks in the set are the radiator and tail light sections and the seats too. This is a brilliant showcase of what these studless beams can do - I counted just 10 places in the whole model where a brick separator could be used to prise bricks apart!</p>

<p>And the whole thing, including running down the the corner shop to buy batteries, took just under <strong>5 hours</strong> of focussed building for me, an experienced AFOL with past experience of Technic. I&#39;d expect it to be a two day job for the average builder, though two people together could make light work of the duplicated axle units and the almost total left/right symmetry. My thumb wasn&#39;t too sore when I&#39;d finished but it does feel a little tender today!</p>

<p>The <strong>finished model </strong>was a bit underwhelming at first when I realised I&#39;d finished and had a quick go at driving it. But the more I looked it at through the evening the more I started to feel really pleased that I had it. It has an understated muscular presence, and the dark colour isn&#39;t so much flashy as classy. I imagine if I can find somewhere to stand it I will feel more and more pleased every time I see it!</p>

<p>But what convinced me I&#39;d done the right thing buying it was when I didn&#39;t just have a go driving it but really pushed it. It&#39;s a quite remarkable machine! The torque it has is incredible; I pushed the legless table top I use to build whilst sat on the floor up against the sofa and drove it up it, and it did it with ease! I think it got pretty close to a 45 degree angle before it couldn&#39;t quite climb! I then decided to drive it round my very cluttered front room, with books strewn all over the place in one corner, and it just pushed its way over the lot.</p>

<p>I assume all this is true of 9398 too, though the issue of the high centre of gravity may be ever so slightly improved in this version, but this is a properly heavy duty machine and it does exactly what it promises! The winch is surprisingly strong too and towed 10220 Camper Van just fine (is this Richard Hammond&#39;s car in a Top Gear challenge? He always brings the winch!), which was subsequently pushed over by big bully 41999 who just wants to drive!</p>

<p>Next thing - an assault course down the hallway! I want to find its limits!</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Exclusivity - from the clean, intriguing box to the dark blue hue and unique number plate this is a very, very special feeling set</li>
	<li>Simple enough to build but filled with good Technic features - differentials, suspension, etc.</li>
	<li>Superb muscular presence; understated but smokin&#39; hot!</li>
	<li>Heavy duty feel - hard to break! (Pieces don&#39;t fall off when you touch it like &#39;normal&#39; Lego)</li>
	<li>Incredibly impressive functions - it&#39;s called the Crawler and it&#39;s not kidding! Slow and mighty!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The exclusivity will mean many of these sets are sealed away - comes with the territory</li>
	<li>Large parts of the chassis build are annoyingly repetitive - I felt quite battered at the end of the 5 hours too! But again, comes with the territory of being a 1,500 piece model</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all I love this set. The car itself is stupendous in what it can do. And where that would have been true of 9398 too, you have to admit 9398 was pig-ugly and this is smoulderingly hot! Therein lies the genius of TLG&#39;s competition - they knew they had an impressive machine that they&#39;d ruined it with gaudy and clumsy styling, so they found a way to remake it and bring in bags and bags of marketing appeal all at once. The MOC style looks superb and I absolutely love that I have number 18,542 of a 20,000 run, and for the same price as the inferior and entirely not-special 9398 too!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s converted me to the new studless Technic style (sorry Crowkiller, I&#39;m still a stud sorta guy!) as I didn&#39;t particularly enjoy the build, but I don&#39;t regret buying and building this one little bit, I&#39;m very, very glad I did. Though it will be the sole Technic model in my collection for now at least it will sit wherever I find to display it with pride and a quiet, enthralling presence. Who knows, maybe a future set will look good enough to be a second step and bring me in gradually!</p>

<p>In short, it&#39;s a real triumph for TLG and I&#39;m not surprised it sold out so quickly (and I&#39;m also glad the Cardiff Lego store doesn&#39;t seem to get emptied by AFOLs the way some do!). RM88 (Egor K?) should be mighty proud of his superb MOC improvement to 9398 and that his work is out there for people to buy.</p>

<p>If you are able to spend &pound;140, which doesn&#39;t seem like much next to some of the flagship sets, and you have the chance to buy it, which is a pretty big if, I&#39;d say it&#39;s an absolute must!</p>

"DrFrankenstein","2015-11-05T22:35:34.013Z","4x4 Crawler on Steroids","<p>The original 4x4 Crawler (9398) had some technical merits, but also some deficiencies. The biggest problem with 9398 was its uninspired (call it ugly) body design. Enter 41999 - an improved meaner crawler with fan-sourced superstructure design. The special edition set is indeed a resounding success in rehashing the otherwise mediocre 4x4 Crawler into a much more exciting model.</p>

<p>The designers went out of their way to make the set luxurious in every aspect. The box is made of higher quality cardboard reminiscent of the pre-2000 Technic sets that stands apart from the current box designs. It is extra cool that the box has designer autographs on it and can be opened without any destruction. Also, it makes a nice storage box for parts because of its sturdiness. Did I mention that the box comes packed to the top with parts - there is no empty space here. The exclusive new technic parts and colors, the painted tire rims, the additional electronics compared to 9398 - one additional S motor, lights, and switch, the unique numbered plate - everything adds to a much more attractive package than its predecessor. Amazingly, LEGO offered the set at the same store price as the original 4x4 ($200 in the US), even though it offers more than its parent. The fact that the price of the set jumped straight to the $300-400 range on the second hand market testifies to the value of this special edition.</p>

<p>Since 41999 is practically indistinguishable from 9398 in terms of chassis mechanics, it&#39;s probably worth discussing the superstructure design, which is different. Personally, I think that 41999 looks a lot better than its ugly cousin 9398 thanks to Egor Karshiev and Markus Kossman&#39;s effort, even if it is not the most unusual machine one could imagine (a fork lift, container loader, or lunar rover could have been more interesting). The addition of the headlights and the motorized winch are welcome additions to the array of functions of the Crawler. It is also nice that the bodywork of new Crawler retains the MOC look that the set was inspired out ot. I wish 41999 included a second set of lights to make all four headlight shine, but I guess you can&#39;t have it all.</p>

<p>All in all, 41999 makes me much happier than 9398 did. While it is not much more of an engineering marvel than 9398 (that is to say, it is not amongst the most technically interesting Technic models), it is unique amongst all Technic sets thanks to the all around deluxe treatment and love that went into producing it. For this reason it is a historic Technic set that has a place on every collector&#39;s shelf and will be talked of for the years to come.</p>

"martiniman","2015-11-16T18:38:25.717Z","Works incredibly well in regular blue too.","<p>Since the price for a real 41999 has gone through the roof, I decided to try the instructions in regular blue. The result was amazing, and we decided we like it even better than the original.</p>

<p>The bright blue looks more Lego-ish, is more vibrant and the bright blue element set has almost all the needed parts. We replaced silver with light blueish grey or white, depending on the location. We did the mirrors and steering wheel in white. Unfortunately we did not have enough 3x7 light blueish grey liftarms. Otherwise that was the preferred option for the bumpers instead of white ones.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/41999-1.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The original box looks awesome, I would really love to see the flagships come in a box like that one, but unfortunately no real box for us. We did not have original instructions either. The intructions on LEGO.com work, but are pretty hard to read. The dark blue is too dark in the PDF&#39;s, and they don&#39;t switch to white contours like they use for black parts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/41999-2.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The original car has a great set of parts for the money:</p>

<p>- 4 motors, 2 L-ones, one servo and one medium.</p>

<p>- Lights and infrared receiver. We did not have a V2 receiver, but a regular one. I&#39;ll return to what that means for playability.</p>

<p>In blue you need a bunch of liftarms, mainly 11 stud long ones.</p>

<p>The original has 3 pairs of 3x11 wing panels, and 3 sets of 3x5 wing panels. In regular blue the 3x5 ones exist, but I had to replace the 3x11 ones with something else. What works really nice is 2 2x5 wings combined with a 5 unit liftarm.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/41999-8.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This is how 2 2x5 wings work on the doors.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/41999-9.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This is how 2x5 wings work as replacement for 3x11 ones on the back</p>

<p>Another part missing in regular blue is the 3M crossblock. I replaced each instance with either a 3 unit regular liftarm (near the headlights) or with 2M crossblocks. Since most 3M crossblocks come in pairs, it is easy to replace them with 3x2M crossblocks. See the details for how this works out. It does not affect sturdyness. I guess Lego wanted to keep special bricks to a minimum, that is why the 3M crossblock also doubles as 3 unit liftarm in some places.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I should pop in a minifig from my classic technic. Unfortunately it will fall through the bottom, as the seats are basically just back-rests.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is great. You spend a big part of your time on the base. It eats a big heap of red parts. It is never really hard, the only tricky bit is when you align the servo to both steering racks, at a moment the frame is completely flexible. A helper-construction makes things a bit easier.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>We really loved how this model can be build in bright blue. We even like it a bit better than the original colour scheme. It feels more LEGO like, and it pops out better. Maybe if I had the original one I would talk otherwise, but that could be the typical Stockholm syndrome reaction like many Apple fans preach.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/41999-3.jpg"" style=""width: 944px; height: 1180px;"" /></p>

<p>Playability is excellent. It really rides many nice obstacles, the clearance and maximum torsion is exceptional. It has many nice details, like opening doors, opening luggage compartment and liftable hood.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/41999-7.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Regarding the PF functions we discovered 2 strange things:</p>

<p>- The V1 receiver has trouble with high current. The weird thing is it works way better on half empty batteries than on full ones. With full ones it seems to run into some current liminiting protection on steeper climbs, where these climbs are taken with ease on half full batteries.</p>

<p>- Remove the white coupling gear from the winch. With it, it is not strong enough. You get a really nice thick cable with this, and it can pull the car vertically with ease. With the white gear in place it slips all the time.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you have an Unimog and Volvo Wheel loader / 9398 Crawler plus a 42042 Crawler crane, go and buy that few missing parts and build yourself this great 41999 copy.</p>
