I&#39;ve reviewed figures way back from the incredible Series 1 Caveman, all the way to the not-so-great Series 10 Skydiver. But none thus far have been as interesting as the figure I&#39;ll be reviewing today: the one and only, the legend, Mr. Gold.</p>

<p>Okay, let me break it down for you. This minifigure was released in 2013 in LEGO Minifigures Series 10, making this the seventeenth figure of the series. Only 5,000 copies of this figure were released, meaning that several full boxes of the series did not include a Mr. Gold, as he was packaged at complete random within cases. I&#39;m sure most LEGO fans already know all about him, but if not, there you go.</p>

<p>This figure sparked a truckload of controversy back in the day; I can easily see why. For completionists, especially collectors who had every CMF up to this point, there would forever be an empty place on the shelf. Take the YouTube famous JangBricks, for example. Despite being a world-famous LEGO collector and builder, he failed to secure an official Mr. Gold, causing him to use a legitimate printer to get the job done. Several cases like this occurred, and I do think, despite the choice of having a rare chase minifigure exceeding the stakes of previous series&#39;, it was just a cover up for an otherwise underwhelming set of 16.</p>

<p>But what about the actual figure itself? What&#39;s so special about him? Well besides the fact that he is so rare, nothing.</p>

<p>All the pieces are caste in pearl gold, but are all coated in a shiny, metallic, golden finish. It does, admittedly, look spectacular, and I love the printing on his face and torso. I also think his accessory, it being that shiny rod, is a good inclusion. Overall, in terms of the figure itself, it looks pretty great, and that&#39;s why I gave it a 5 out of 5, because these reviews are for the figures themselves, not the controversy surrounding it.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, there are still thousands of Mr. Gold in circulation, believe it or not, and at the time of writing this, the hunt for him has been reignited. Nonetheless, because of the heavy controversy this figure caused, I don&#39;t imagine we&#39;ll get another hyper rare chase figure again.</p>

<p>That is it for this review, and if you plan on searching for Mr. Gold yourself, I sincerely wish you the best of luck! I find it crazy how this was only $2.99 back in the day, and now it&#39;s thousands of dollars. Good luck getting one for a reasonable price! Thanks for reading, and stay safe!</p>
