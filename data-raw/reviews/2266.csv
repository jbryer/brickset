The orange color is good for this set, and the part on the backside is nice too. It's a nice set! for kids this set is hard to break, because the pieces are big. it's not hard to build either. I saw these in shops and they whore cheap and fun,</p>

"Skut","2014-11-28T07:13:14.49Z","A set that will live in infamy...","<p>This set has acquired a sort of cult following as one of Lego&#39;s worst ever.&nbsp; The windscreen piece alone justifies an overall&nbsp;set rating of&nbsp;1 (a zero in fact but I can&#39;t rate below a 1).&nbsp; Indeed this set is a good reason for Brickset to introduce a zero rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set represents the nadir of juniorisation and it was sets like these that almost sent Lego broke in the early 2000s.&nbsp; Every designer employed by Lego should have a picture of this set as their desktop art on their computers, as a constant reminder what <u>not</u> to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just about every other tow truck ever released by Lego has better play value than this monstrosity.&nbsp; If you have some small person in your life who you really dislike, find this online and buy it for them.&nbsp; Who knows, the seller may even pay you to take it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I saw this set had only one review and it was a 4, I simply had to set the record straight.&nbsp; Other lovers of Lego should do the same to take the average&nbsp;rating of this abomination down to the&nbsp;level where it belongs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have been warned!</p>

"ao_ka","2015-04-14T06:15:48.36Z","Everytime I see the absurdly juniorized parts of this monstrosity I get sick","<p>Oh my.... The years of 2001-2005 were really, really bad for me, and the hideous Jack Stone and 4 Juniors themes justify this. What I was thinking when I thought that these monstrosities were great? What??? I really don&#39;t know, and when I simply see images of these&nbsp;things again, I get really, really sad... It could have been&nbsp;a SW set or of any other theme in place of this!!! Even though I purchased these thing many years ago, nowadays I&#39;m very regretful of them, like I said, it could have been&nbsp;something very better....</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t remember very well, but was a very simple box, blue, with the image of this frankentruck&nbsp;driving on a road with some simple scenery on background.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing. NOTHING useful. The wheels are hideous, the chassis is bizarre, and the cabin and tow pieces are totally awful. Only the two 1x3 roof bricks can be useful in some MOC or&nbsp;set that you lost these pieces, the rest can be forgotten. Also,&nbsp;it cost&nbsp;10 dollars for just 25 pieces!! In my case, even worse, in Brazil it cost&nbsp;R$54,90 (at the time, equivalent to 20&nbsp;dollars, the double of the price!), it&#39;s total waste of money!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures? What minifigure??? What you got here is an abomination, the jackstonefigures are horrific, they can&#39;t even be disassembled, and are totally out of place near the true minifigures. I&#39;m currently thinking of burning all my jackstonefigures soon, I can&#39;t stand these things anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Utterly boring, totally boring. It exceeds all boring levels, even when I was younger this was bad. It&#39;s done in less than 2 minutes...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Bizarre, awful, hideous, horrible, dull, arrgh... Look at the wheels, the bumper, the tow, the set at all. It&#39;s a disgrace.&nbsp;Kids of 4-8&nbsp;years need really good sets, these ultra juniorized themes underestimate the kids capacity of building great things, seriously.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>And for the end: Don&#39;t buy this, seruously, DON&#39;T BUY THIS. Even if you have money to waste, avoid this frankenstein with wheels and all other Jack Stone/4 Juniors sets. I was young and saw something useful on these things, but, as soon as I buyed these sets I started to regret my decisions.&nbsp;That&#39;s it, you were warned.</p>
