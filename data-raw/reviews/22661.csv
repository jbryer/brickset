"TooMuchLEGO","2013-04-13T22:10:18.553Z","Awesome Game!","<p>LEGO City Undercover follows your basic LEGO game formula, but with this title, you get to explore an open city and unlike the other LEGO titles, this game has an original&nbsp;story line&nbsp;not attached to any third-party licenses. Because of this, Undercover is now my personal favorite Wii U game.</p><p>Being a Wii U exclusive, the title has some features dedicated to the game. Chase McCain, the main character, has a police scanner that mimics your GamePad controller. With your GamePad, you can view a map of the city at all times and answer video calls from your colleagues. You can also perform data scans by moving the Pad in real life- unfortunately, you cannot just move the control stick instead, so if you're on the couch and don't feel like getting up, you'll have a real hard time scanning. Besides these features, there's not much the GamePad adds, so it's a shame there's no support for Off-TV play.</p><p>The graphics are very pretty, and a welcome update from the Wii games. I've observed LEGO Lord of the Rings on Xbox and this game's graphical quality seems to surpass it. I never noticed any frame rate drops in Undercover either.</p><p>I should mention that Undercover is huge. When I finally finished the story missions, I had 20 hours on the game- and at that time I only had 30% completed. There's tons of collectibles and tons to do in the city- you can race, you can do free running courses (which are an absolute blast to complete), you can perform car thefts, you can arrest gangs, you can build super builds, there's so much to do I can't even name it all.</p><p>The story in this game is pretty simple- Chase McCain needs to arrest Rex Fury, and he needs to go undercover to do so. At the same time, Chase tries to reconnect with his love interest Natalia. The script is extremely funny, so there is no worry that the plot will be dull. (At one point very early in the game, Chase asks a rooftop crowd ""Is anybody here a bank robbing clown?"", and at another point Chief Dunby is&nbsp;briefing&nbsp;the officers when a janitor comes in and begins&nbsp;vacuuming&nbsp;very loudly.)</p><p>Unfortunately this game isn't perfect- unlike previous LEGO games where co-op play was a key feature, it is no where to be seen here, which is a shame, because this game would be a lot of fun with friends. Even worse are the loading times, which take roughly thirty seconds to complete. Thirty seconds! (Part of this may have to do with the hardware though, which has&nbsp;noticeably&nbsp;long loading times when starting up games.) Even so, thirty seconds is way too long, so it's a good thing they're infrequent.</p><h4><b>Pros</b></h4>
<ul><li>Absolutely hilarious script</li><li>Open world</li><li>Easy to control</li><li>Likable characters</li><li>Free running courses</li><li>Very big game</li><li>Fresh combat</li><li>Frank Honey</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Lengthy loading times</li><li>GamePad integration isn't very original</li><li>A bit too easy at times</li><li>Lack of co-op play</li><li>No off TV play</li></ul>
<p>Undercover may have its flaws, but its original ideas make it the best LEGO and Wii U game yet. Considering it sells for $50 as opposed to $60 like other Wii U games, Undercover is a fantastic value. Wii U owners, buy it! If you don't have one yet, you better make this one of your first purchases- you'd be silly not to!</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
"ickleb","2013-10-26T20:31:46.017Z","Best Lego game yet.....!!","<p>I am massive fan of all the lego games produced by Tt and this one has excelled well past those that come have come before, it is amazing. &nbsp;The graphics are fabulous and it's really addictive and has the wonderful sense of humour that all the games have but it's up a notch for the adults playing tribute to some movie classics. &nbsp;It also makes great us of the wii u controller which is why I've had to buy a wii u just for this game but it's worth it!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Amazing graphics</li><li>Lego Humour</li><li>Very Playable</li><li>Beautiful attention to detail</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Had to buy a wii u to play it</li><li>Game quite pricy</li><li>Hope it's not too short to get through&nbsp;</li></ul><div>Wonderful game, lets hope that Tt and Lego stay together for a long time to come!</div>

"Super_Mario_64","2014-01-15T14:54:57.08Z","Best LEGO game ever!","<p>This is a must buy if you have or are thinking about buying a WiiU. If you're not, you should be. The graphics aren't fantastic, but get the job done. The storyline is amazing(I'm only at Farmer Chase), and it feels like you're in a real-life city.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Exclusive to the best system ever</li><li>Super long, so you get a great money value</li><li>Its only $40 at LEGO.com now.</li><li>This is the first time that LEGO has been able to just create an original game instead of following a specific storyline, and the results are amazing.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>None!</li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>If you have a WiiU, this is a must buy. LEGO and Tt really hit it out of the park this time!</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
