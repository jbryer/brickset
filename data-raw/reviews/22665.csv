<p>Comes in normal polybag&nbsp;bag and doesn&#39;t come with instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any unique or special parts outside of the minifigure. The new hood mold was a really nice piece to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is my favorite Han Solo yet. The new hood mold is really nice. You also get his traditional hair piece as well. Han&#39;s head is doubled sided. You get the one you see on the bag and then one with goggles&nbsp;and mask that go with the hood. The detail on the jacket is also really nice as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is my favorite Han Solo yet. This Hoth version of him is great. The detail on the jacket is really good. The new hood piece is also really nice. The expressions on his doubled sided head was also really good as well. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
This set comes in a poly bag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Han has a new fur&nbsp;hood piece. This cannot fit in his hand as shown on the poly bag. He also has his traditional brown&nbsp;hair piece. His head is double-sided featuring a shivering expression and a face covered in cold wraps with snow goggles. The torso is a brown fur jacket with lots of pockets, it is printed on both sides with a belt. The legs are printed with the dark brown ends of&nbsp;the coat. Han has no weapon and I think would be better with a small pistol.</p>

<p>Han Solo is vital to any Echo Base or Hoth scene and this is the way to get him for a very reasonable price. Thank you for reading my review and if you&#39;re interested in other minifig poly bags, check out my reviews for TC-14, R3-M2 and the Scarif&nbsp;Stormtrooper.<br />
