<h3 class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">The Film</h3>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">This&nbsp;review isn&#39;t really about the film, but I will say a few things. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was <em>by far</em> my favorite film of 2012. What disappointed me was the critics&#39; responses. Many critics didn&#39;t like it. I think this is mainly the result of two things. First, The Lord of the Rings series was so good, especially for it&#39;s time. RotK won 11 Academy Awards and the other films did amazingly well also. Since LotR was so good I think it set the bar way too high for The Hobbit. People were just expecting too much or something totally unlike <em>The Hobbit</em>.</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">Second, most people who read Tolkien simply read <em>The Hobbit</em> and <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> alone. They don&#39;t continue on and read the appendixes in the back, <em>The Silmarillion</em>, <em>The Unfinished Tales</em>, and so forth. But people who read other Tolkien books, especially the Quest of Erebor and part III of Appendix A, know that so much more is going on in the story than what is presented in <em>The Hobbit</em>. Middle-earth is such a complex world with many layers of depth, that&#39;s one of the reasons why it feels so real. Peter Jackson and the writers know this too and included much of this back-story into the film. However, all those critics who have only read <em>The Hobbit</em> thought, and falsely accused Peter Jackson of adding all this stuff. (Now don&#39;t get me wrong, he did add/modify/expand several sequences and characters.) I read so many reviews by people who said they liked the film except for all the &#39;added&#39; stuff like the battle of Azanulbizar and the White Council, all of which were true to cannon (mostly).</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3 class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">Special Features</h3>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">On the special features disc (which is Blu-ray) are all 10 production vlogs. There&#39;s also a near-7 minute featurette about New-Zealand as Middle-earth. On a different section are several trailers for the film and Middle-earth related video games (including LEGO Lord of the Rings) and then there&#39;s the LEGO video. This was like an extended designer video about the making the LEGO Hobbit toys. We got to hear from several different designers (all with Danish accents) about what they did on the project. Highlights included seeing how they made the Goblin King piece and several of the minifigures. They also showed us the sketch model of Bag End again. The LEGO featurette was cool, but not fantastic. They basically show you the same processes of how they make things that you can learn about in the free designer videos on YouTube and/or the LEGO site.</p>

<h3 class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">Live Sneak Peak and Ultraviolet</h3>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">The hour long sneek peak was quite enjoyable.&nbsp; The only thig disappointing about it is that they spent the majority of the time answering questions that we already know the answers to.&nbsp; But they did show us some cool artwork and some raw footage which was definately worth it.&nbsp; Unfortunately for those who missed the live version the edited one (which is available until some time in May) has had most of the really cool parts taken out (like a lot of the clips).</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">I can&#39;t tell you much about the Ultraviolet stuff since I don&#39;t use it. So I&#39;ll sort of skip this part and go straight to the minifig...</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3 class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">Exclusive Bilbo Baggins Minifig</h3>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">Out of all the Bilbos this may be my favorite. However, the only really exclusive part of him is his torso. His head can be found in the Riddles for the Ring and Barrel Escape sets. His hair and legs are included with every other Bilbo too. But the torso is very well done. The printing of his vest is exquisite. Enough talking, the pictures can explain for themselves.</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;""><br />
The only disappointing thing about him is that he was made in China (or Mexico).</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">I definitely like this minifigure, but I think LEGO could have chosen a different one to include that would&#39;ve been even better. I&#39;m specifically thinking of Azog. He wasn&#39;t included in a set because of the late change last summer when 2 films turned into 3. If he was included demand for this version would have really sky-rocketed.&nbsp; But I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll be released in future sets so he wouldn&#39;t have really been exclusive then.&nbsp; Radagast could&#39;ve been another possibility. But maybe is was too late for LEGO to change this as well, or perhaps Warner Brothers wanted Bilbo (or like Azog he&#39;ll be released in future sets).</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">Many people have been confused though since we don&#39;t see him like this in the film. However, he was shown in this exact outfit, scarf and all, in the first trailer while he was walking through Hobbiton:</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;"">&nbsp;Multiple people in interviews have alluded to this scene so hopefully we&#39;ll get to see it in the Extended Edition (which will come out just in time for Christmas!).</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: left; clear: both;""><strong>Update:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, this scene is in the Extended Edition so this version of Bilbo is in the film.</p>

<p>Some have taken the above picture and claimed that we will get this minifig in sets again later. However, if you look at Bilbo&#39;s costume when he&#39;s on the gold and compare it to when he&#39;s walking through Hobbiton you can spot many differences. The blue coat that he&#39;s wearing on the gold was/is probably a gift from the people of Lake-town to replace his soaked red coat after his long wet journey with the barrels. So I don&#39;t think we will ever have a chance to get this minifig again so hurry up and get to your local Target ASAP!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, The Brick Show in their review of him made a very good point. This promotion goes to show just how well LEGO is doing if top studios (like WB) are putting LEGO minifigures in special editions of billion dollar films to hype up release. That&#39;s pretty cool. If you think about it, minifigures are the perfect promotional items to go in a film case for several reasons. They&#39;re the perfect size, not too big and not too small, plus they&#39;re extremely collectible, and of course, they look good (&quot;cute&quot; as I&#39;ve heard some say). LEGO also has a huge following and avid fans who wouldn&#39;t normally care for The Hobbit buy the film simply for the minifig. &nbsp;Of course, it&#39;s not so exciting for our wallets. :-) &nbsp;Anyway, just something to think about.</p>

"LordofHobbits","2016-08-30T02:58:00.437Z","Excellent Minifigure!","<p>With that exclusive bright blue print, there&#39;s no way you can miss this extraordinary minifigure!</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing in way of instructions, but it comes in separate cardboard packaging from the dvd case itself, so you don&#39;t have the spot where the minifigure was stuck to your movie forever, so&nbsp;that&#39;s a plus!</p>

<p>I absolutely LOVE the front torso printing on the figure. The back, well, it&#39;s just, simply put, the back. It&#39;s pretty much solid blue, save for the bottom, which has the flaps of his coat.&nbsp;I feel there could have been much more detail put into the print, but it looks excellent from the front. Other than that, I&#39;m fairly certain all the other parts have appeared in different sets, so not much more to mention with parts.</p>

<p>This minifigure is, in my opinion, second only to the good morning Bilbo Baggins. It would be first, except for the &quot;printing&quot; on the back. But all in all, it&#39;s a great minifigure!</p>

<p>The completed model looks fantastic, but being just a figure, it has next to no playability. It looks marvelous on display, though!</p>

<p>Even though this is a great minifigure, I would only suggest it to collectors or people just looking for a nice display figure. This version of Bilbo does appear in the film, by the way, but only in the extended edition. It is a great minifigure, but I have to say the back printing slightly downgrades the significance of this figure. Other than that it has&nbsp;a high position on my shelf! I hope this helped!</p>

"Pikachew3","2022-08-18T00:13:12.29Z","Great figure for great movie.","<p>I found this at a video store for $25 a year ago, sealed too. That was a good day. Highly recommend, my personal favourite LOTR/hobbit minifigure, I wouldn&#39;t suggest spending $100 for the minifigure unless you really want it though, my recommendation is to check your local video stores for this version of the film.</p>
