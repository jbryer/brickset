It was made up of mainly large pieces, to make it easy for a 5 year old to build. The instructions were not that easy to follow though. I hated the minifig",FALSE,3,2,3,4,4

<p>What really makes this set stand out, though, is the chrome! 6 large tanker pieces completely covered in chrome on the sides, it looks amazing when put together! The Octan printing is also a nice touch.&nbsp;It really pains my heart to see such great looking pieces on such a poor model, being blocky and juniorized doesn&#39;t do those chrome parts justice. It would look much much better with the tank pieces being utilised in a custom tanker truck MOC, using standard system parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, a poor set, only those special parts really save it from being an absolute disaster. But after all, it is only a 4 Juniors set... what was I really expecting?</p>
