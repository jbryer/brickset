But the minifigures are a joke.&nbsp; the vehicle looks looks stupid and is a piece of junk,the gas pumps are tiny and are the worst of their kind. this gas station does have some good pieces.if you are trying to make a lego fast food shop.finding this set cheap should not be too hard.but don't buy this set unless you find it for a dollar. -Thanks for reading.</p>",TRUE,1,2,1,1,1
