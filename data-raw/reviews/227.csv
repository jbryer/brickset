"Novelty","2007-05-05T04:54:15.903Z","Box on Wheels","This is another box of tools, placed on a cart this time with a baby dinosaur and a minifig.  Building is minimal and the cart looks horrible with the mismash of colours.  The baby dinosaur also doesn't seem to fit in the set and seems to be included as a spare part.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

More of an exploration and study wagon than an action set, combined with more sets from the same theme this gives you a fantastic little boost! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"F260","2011-12-07T21:13:22.847Z","Small but good","I actually got the parts to the set in a random bag of legos and looked on the internet for the instructions. I built it and was glad to have a set from 1998 but the set other than collectors value is kind of useless. The minifigure Johnny Thunder is very well made and the baby dino you get in the cart is a classic. The tools and pieces are fairly good. Over all it's a fine set not much to it and like I said before it's kind of worthless.&nbsp;<div><div>&nbsp;</div></div>",FALSE,3,4,2,2,4
