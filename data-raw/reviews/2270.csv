Many adult LEGO fans don't like these sets because of their use of large parts, but to see a 4-year old play with them is proof enough that LEGO has got the right idea.

This is perfect for kids who have moved beyond Duplo, but aren't ready for the more complicated skills required to work with classic LEGO. And many of the parts are classic LEGO, so it can be dumped into your LEGO bin without standing out.

My kids have LEGO sets that span the range from Duplo to Technic, and the 4-year old usually digs out the Jack Stone/4 Juniors stuff to build his creations. That alone is a good indication that LEGO knows what 4-year olds want.

Congratulations LEGO! Another well thought out set!

On the other hand he does not really like those big parts – first of al they’re not as easy to fit as it seems to be and then they can’t be really used for another building. So this is the only set he did use the parts to build something else.

The time when a young child is “too old” for the duplo and “too young” for basic bricks is so short it is not worth to invest in 4 junior sets.
