I like the design of the cop cars and it hold up well in rough play and also makes a gool stunt car! Now onto pros and cons:

Pros: bigfig( Iuse him as an evil person to fight minifigs!)

car is simple and has good design

car holds up good.

cons: nothing that comes to mind.

Any way it is a good set only because it serves as a bad guy(in my opinion) for minifigs. I reccomend getting it for about 3-5 dollars.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
