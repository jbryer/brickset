Few pieces that makes it easy to build although the sign is easy to lose or break from a 4 year olds perpective.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I also liked the road sign. This is one of the only 4+ models I keep in the display cabinet built.  I really like this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-04-26T14:44:33.39Z","nice bulldozer, even for 4+","I like this set and think it is a good representation for minifgs and bigfigs alike! the set is built to both mini and bigfig scale. I like the classic look and thesign can be used in a lego city. The set may be junoirzed but it's one of the best. I reccomend this set because of universal use and say to get it for about 5-15 dollars. I rate it about a 8.5/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
