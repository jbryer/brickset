The boat floats and can go around in circles or straight using the add on motor.  It will follow the sides of the tub when going straight.

The antennas are not a very good itdea on a set for a four year old.  They don't stay on very well when being played with.  Other than that it is a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
