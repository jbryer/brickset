So I'll give a brief overview of the book and the Mini-Fig introduced with it.</p>
<p>DK Books are always well crafted and sturdy, with rich looking glossy pages and detailed imagery of whatever items the book is about. Like Star Wars, Harry Potter and Ninjago before them the Collectible Mini-Figures from Series 1-10 have now recieved detailed information for young and old alike to enjoy. Each page is dedicated to one Mini-Figure from all 10 Series. Giving a glimpse at the character traits LEGO envisioned for each Mini-Fig. There's also a very brief two-page spread about how a Mini-Fig is designed.</p>
<p>With over 200 pages the contents do not dissapoint for the younger crowd. Older collectors may find themselves rolling their eyes at some of what's in the book, though I personally don't think so. If anything this is a wonderfully compact carry-all with detailed images of each Mini-Figure, it's new accessories and name. With some interesting facts on top of that, such as where a new accessory came from originally or something about the Mini-Fig in question.</p>
<p>Like most DK books we're also given a brand new exclusive Mini-Figure, the Toy Soldier, who uses a few parts we've seen before and features a nicely detailed print on the front of his torso and, a rare sight, the sides of his legs and arms. His hat is the same one we've seen since it was first introduced in the Pirates Theme, but it's quite nice and colorful here. He's also carrying the musket and has a bracket on his back for the LEGO key piece introduced with the Clockwork Robot. Also of note, he has no pieces that were made in China.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is a great book for kids and fans of the Collectible Mini-Figures, while true that most books of this type are slowly becoming obsolete due to the very nature of the internet, it's never something I think should go away completely. Books of this type are perfect introductions for younger readers and collectors, and the Mini-Fig is a nice little addition. Unfortunately he doesn't include a stand like the others, so you'll have to borrow one from someone else. Strongly recommended, Costco had them at 10$ CND a month back, more might come in for the holidays too, so don't pass this opportunity up.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,1,4
