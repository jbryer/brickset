"Professor_X","2015-09-30T21:56:57.947Z","""You will give the people of Earth an ideal to strive towards.""","<p>&nbsp; Jor-El is a minifigure that I&#39;ve wanted to&nbsp;get my hands on for a couple years now, Not only because I like Jor-El but because I am a big Russell Crowe fan. So naturally, when it showed up on Bricklink for an amazingly low price, I HAD to get my hands on it! Is Jor-El&nbsp;a must have LEGO Shop exclusive, or just a promo from a short-lived subtheme. Read on to find out...</p>

<p>The Completed Minifigure:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; While I really like the Jor-El minifgure, I assume he&#39;s based on some abandoned concept art because&nbsp;he doesn&#39;t resemble his movie appearance at all. From the neck down, Jor-El&nbsp;is almost exactly like the Man of Steel version of Superman, with his S symbol colored brown rather than red. From the neck up, however, Jor-El is obviously very different, sporting a brown cape, a single-sided head piece that resembles Russell Crowe very accurately, and a dark-brown&nbsp;tousled hair piece used extensively since the release of the Mutt Williams minifigure back in 2008.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Thoughts:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; If you are a fanatical superhero minifigure collector like me or a Russell Crowe fan, it might bother you not to own this minifigure. But if you don&#39;t fit either of those categories, then I would say Jor-EL probably isn&#39;t worth his usual asking price on Bricklink&nbsp;($17.00 CA, $13.00 US). Of course, if you find one far below the asking price (I got mine for nearly half of what it&#39;s worth normally!) then you should definitely pick it up. Otherwise, you may want to consider other minifigures&nbsp;at similar price points.</p>
