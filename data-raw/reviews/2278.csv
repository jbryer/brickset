I expected the box to have the usual plain bricks in basic colors like the bucket has, but NO! Harry potter pieces, blank minifig heads, doors, pipes, decorated tiles, and loads of bricks and plates in strange colors like orangey brown and harry potter purple. Came with three small baseplates too! one of them in white!

Im about to go buy another one just to see if its a random assortment every time. even if it isnt, id be happy.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-24T20:08:48Z","Lego finally did it right!","This set is amazing. It's exactly what bulk bricks should be all about. A crazy random assortment of sweet pieces for an insanely cheap price. Gotta love it. It's got everthing from purple slopes to blue doors to dark red clips to light yellow baseplates. You might even get some themed parts, like Imperial logos.

That aside the buck has a 500 peice box attached to it with RANDOM contents. While a great deal look to be leftovers bits from everthing from NBA, Harry Potter, Star Wars, Life on Mars, and Spiderman Sets, the selection is unusual and excellent. Every one I've opened so far has had the folling elements though: Four small baseplates one each in dark green, green, white and pale yellow; a fair amount of unprinted brown minifig heads from the dismal failure of the NBA sets, one 2X12 plate in either light grey or, far more often white; at least one technic holed light grey 1X2 brick. The other stuff is all over the place but common elements include pink bricks or arches, black and/or green unprinted minifig heads, trans coloured 1X2 tiles, small wings, printed slopes(nearly no unprinted slopes and those are only in grey), red half arches, freestyle doors, trans(various) round 1X1 plates, other unusual cloured 1X1 round plates, big flowers, 1X1 tiles, 1X1 plate with tooth, dome topped 2X2s, large white 1 wide wedges, 1X2X5 orange-brown bricks,  and modified curved edged dark grey plates.

Loads of black, green, blue , brown and beige heads. nearly all the printed parts (there are a lot of them) are from failed lines like nba and some star wars logoed pieces. I would honestly kill for more of these sets, and if you see one of these sets then buy it! Quite a few cash register pieces and technic pieces in random colours such as banana yellow and sand purple. Also loads of printed sloped pieces and some baseplates (small).
also some pillars from the new harry potter sets and some skin toned heads.(unprinted)

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-05T17:16:30Z","A little confusing for my eight-year old daughter  ","One of these boxes was attached to a lego starter box I bought in Toys R Us last week in Stevenage, UK. As the other reviewers write it contained a random selection of odd bricks and plates and so on.  On first inspection it looks as if you could build something meaningful with all the odd shapes, but there are no instructions.  I'm sure these pieces will become useful as my daughter (and I) get more into lego building.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-25T16:18:52Z","The best set ever.","OK, so this may not be the best set ever for design, but if you look at the price, that takes away all the competitors.  The pieces you get are very useful (pitty about all the pink, but never mind).  The selection is extremely varied and no matter what stage you are at in your LEGO hobby, you will appreciate this.  I was sorting the pieces into my collection today and I was thinking, 'did I really get all these pieces for &#163;20?'  The pieces just seemed to go on and on.  You people in America are even more lucky.  Here the cost of the set is &#163;20.  In America it is $20.  This means that you get it for nearly half the price (It's already low at double the American price).  One good thing about this set is that it contains virtually no new grey.  Mine contained three pieces in total, I believe (1/666th of the total).  There were also a few 1xy bricks in new brown.  That is probably my only problem with this set:  there are two many colours.  There should be more dark grey and less pink (but that's just my view).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-26T11:07:40Z","Superb","More More I need more at first i thougt the 500 box set were special pieces but evey box was the same It's not It's Random so every 500 box is different
Evertime you open one it's a suprise some pieces I think (what the ..)the red box is notthing special
but the price is 39€ 
39€ for a red box with 1500 pieces and a 500 box extra random pieces 
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2000 pieces for 39€&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
get this 
there's no other set for that price with so many pieces
correct me if i'm wrong
if this was a ordinary creator box with many bricks I think 5/10 but the 500 extra give it a 10/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Maybe i'll get a red ghost someday from one of these sets!...:)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-23T22:21:17Z","Amazing selection of weird pieces","The 500-piece add-on is a great source of unusual pieces in unusual colors.  Being an obsessive Lego collector, this appeals greatly to me.  So far, I have bought four of these sets and I will buy as many as my budget will allow until they are gone.  Some highlights include pink and pastel-colored bricks (I love these colors and wish I could get more), doors, a variety of windows (in two of the sets), interesting painted pieces (one set had a great number of pizzas), slopes, arches, tiles, Technic pieces, base plates, the mysterious unpainted heads, and about anything else imaginable.  Each set is different to some degree.  It leaves me wondering about one thing, however:  what will I do with all the unpainted heads?  I have a few ideas:  (1) use the green and brown ones, along with flowers and plants, in landscaping; (2) architectural elements, such as weird bulbous fences or columns; (3) to make some rather unusual mini-figures (I imagine a monster called &quot;Green Head&quot; [or &quot;Brown Head&quot; or &quot;Black Head&quot;] who runs around derailing trains; (4) loose in a train car, representing any sort of loose cargo.  Does anyone else have any other ideas?  Again, this is a great set for collectors and for people with a good sense of creativity, but the extra pieces may be of limited use to young children.  By the way, the red tub contains a good variety of &quot;normal&quot; bricks as well.  One can never have too many.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T03:23:49Z","A lot of bricks!","At first, i misuderstood the reviews posted here. I thought they said the extra pieces of this set are not random. After buying it, i found out i have different pieces from the pics that posted in www.brickshelf.com. Then only I realized that i misunderstood the reviews. Hahaha.

In a nut shell, a good set for those who like weird/strange/rare piece.
