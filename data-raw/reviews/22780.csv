<p>Everything was still fine and workd, the box was just a bit smooshed. I didn't care, I really wanted the Mini-Fig so I bought it regardless of the condition of the packaging.</p>
<p>This is basically the story of LEGO Batman 2 the Video Game in movie form, however that doesn't mean you should write it off too quickly. There is a lot more to offer here than just the re-done cutscenes from the game, not only do you get to see some prize winning brickfilm shorts featuring Batman, but there's a special bonus video about making Brickfilms from... I believe a winner of one of the contests, it was a gentleman I've forgotten the name of who was showing how to make stop motions to a bunch of kids. A really great short with some touching moments honestly.</p>
<p>Not only that, but as this is a Warner Brothers production it includes three bonus cartoon episodes, two from Batman The Brave and the Bold and one from Teen Titans. Presentation wise I'm already much more impressed with this than either of the two Star Wars shorts previously made available if only because there is a lot more content here for younger fans to enjoy. Still no activities or games to join in with interactively, but much more content than the previous Star Wars releases with Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>Now on to Clark Kent, first of all he's a made in china kind of Mini-Figure, like most pack-ins with DVDs and Blu-Rays are these days. And his printing is very limited, he has a single-sided torso and head print only. That being said these are great looking prints, although Clark Kent is doomed to forever reveal his secret identity to the world as his torso print has an undone suit and tie revealing the S shield underneath. Makes a bit of sense, he'd be rather boring with just a plain torso print you can find on any City Buisnessman, plus this leaves it open for LEGO to include a Clark Kent Mini-Figure in a future set with him just wearing a suit and not having the Superman costume revealed underneath.</p>
<p>The hairpiece is a bit dissapointing, it's Robin's hair, now I understand Clark would have a different style in his secret identity, but why give him Robin's hairpiece? It isn't as unique that way and looks a little off-putting when Clark and Robin are standing side-by-side.</p>
<p>Overall though this is a highly collectible Mini-Fig and much sought after judging by how fast it sold out around here when it first showed up. The DVD also has lots to enjoy after watching the main program and certain touches of the show itself are much appreciated, the main show has an opening sequence lifted straight out of Tim Burton's 1989 Batman, it was loads of fun watching that re-enactment in LEGO form of the great Batsymbol reveal from the opening credits of the classic Batman film. The animation also has additional scenes and bits of dialogue so it isn't just the game, there's even a shot of all the various in-game suits lining one wall of the Batcave... They don't actually get used, but it's nice that they gave a nod to the original source material like that. Definitely pick this one up if you can, the young fans will love watching all the material here and the Clark Kent Mini-Fig is just the icing on the cake, with only very minor issues.</p>",TRUE,4,1,1,1,4
