<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It's packaged in a celophane envelope which is sealed with reclosable adhesive on the side.&nbsp; there's a cardstock backing and half of the track is plainly visible along with the 2x16 plate in tan, which is glued into the board.&nbsp; There is of course a child having a grand old time playing with his Speedor and the stylized ""SPEEDORZ"" logo with a ball of Chi as the letter O.&nbsp; About 3/4 of the folded playmat//track is visible and you can see the LEGO Chima branding as well as the foam bumpers that make up the track, and the cut out on the sides that make handles when folded.&nbsp; Opening the package carefully will allow it to be used as a storage bag for the mat if you so wish.&nbsp; Inside there is the mat itself and another resealable baggie with the small parts.&nbsp; The instructions are a single sheet which unfolds to a bit smaller than 8.5""x11"" paper and has a parts list and shows two ways to set up the parts on the track, either as small rock obstacles on the sides of the track, or as a pair of ramps.&nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The box lists 25 parts and part is why I bought this.&nbsp; First is the track itself, a bifolding heavy board with cutout handles and foam blocks with cardstock tops printed in a jungle path style.&nbsp; About 2/3 of the way to the middle on each board is a tan 2x16 plate, which is glued to the board.&nbsp; The bumpers come in 1 stud narrower than the plates so the ""dirt"" track is actually 14 studs wide, or about 4.75"". At the two corners there are circular blue ""Chi"" holograms inset into the board which wasn't visible in the package and are a cool touch that is included in many LoC sundries.</p><p>The parts are as follows:</p><p>4 - dark bluish grey 2x2 45deg slope bricks<br></p><p>2 - dark red 4x6 tiles with studs on 3 edges (12 studs)<br></p>4 - light bluish grey 1x1 round tiles<br><br>2 - dark bluish grey 1x2 hinge brick bases<br><br>2 - black 2x2 hinge plates<br><br>2 - dark tan 1x2x2/3 30deg slopes (double cheese)<br><br>4 - light bluish grey 1x1x2/3 30deg slopes (cheese)<br><br>4 - dark tan 1x1x2/3 30deg slopes (cheese)!<br><br>Yes boys &amp; girls, ladies &amp; gentlemen, children of all ages! We! Finally! Have! Dark! Tan! Cheese! Slopes! =-D<br><br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>None, zip, zilch, nada, zero, not a sausage.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Put some pieces down to look like rocks or make some rudimentary ramps.&nbsp; Not much to build here.&nbsp; The package sleeve shows building over and around the bumpers using 2x4 bricks, which would be simple as the bumpers are slightly less than 1 brick high and 2 studs wide.&nbsp; The more interesting use shows the Jungle Gates Speedorz challenge built over the two plates and adding that or other chima challenges would make this very interesting.&nbsp; I would have liked to have seen more plates to build onto, or maybe a way to attach more than one board together.</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Did I need to spend $16.99 on this?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is it a good deal for the parts?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Did I want some dark tan cheese and am I a Speedorz fan that doesn't mind adding this to his collection ( I own all 10 already) Yes.&nbsp; I don't think it's prohibitively priced and I think a child who owned some speedorz sets would enjoy receiving this, or with some speedorz as a gift, as it clears up the mystery of where to play (and allows you to play them more easily on rugs &amp; carpets).&nbsp; More importantly: DARK TAN CHEESE!</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,3
