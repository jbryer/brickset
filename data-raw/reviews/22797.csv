<p>This gold minifigure keychain is one that will undoubtedly grab many a FOL&#39;s eye hanging on a rack in a LEGO store. I mean, it&#39;s gold, for crying out loud! Gold is cool, right?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As a keychain, this set, naturally, has only one part: the &#39;fig itself. It is fully compatible with normal LEGO bricks, and can be used as a normal minifigure. Although, of course, the large chain &amp; keyring on top greatly hamper useability. For its intended use, as a keychain, the model is superb. It functions as all normal minifig keychains, and is nice for showing off.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Just a glued-together chrome gold basic minifig. As an alert looker may notice, the hands of the fig are, in fact, unchromed. They are a sort of bland yellow colour. As a owner may notice, this is true on the inside of the minifig&#39;s legs as well, implying that the fig was merely spraypainted at the factory, and not a really super-good quality figure.</p>

<p>One issue with the figure is that it has no accessories at all, no hat/hair/chestpiece/handheld object. This can somewhat detract from the fig, and even the solid gold can become a monotone after a while, what with little other eyecandy besides.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>LOL! Build=0 stars.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you like everything to be perfect, I think that the unpainted leg insides may be a bit of a bummer. Same goes for the lack of visual breakups. The rest of the minifig, however, is quite nice, and the gold colour is a winner.</p>

I think it&#39;s nice to be able to purchase a golden minifigure for only $5 that is attached to a keyring. The downside of this product is that if you clip it to your keys or a backpack it will get really scratched up.</p>

<p>I like this keychain and would recommend it as a very nice display piece.</p>
