The minifigure is rare, have a hard to find body and face, one easy to find thing is the Johnny Thunder's hat(easy to find when it was released, now become a hard to find one). I don't know the reason about the set's name, maybe something about the minifigure. The plane is little and can't be putted some minifigures on this. The colors are great, like the black and blue, previously very used in older sets, turning it useful to creations. The two wheels were too of older sets, and can't keeps it in feet, but isn't a great problem. Is included a black propeller piece on the front, like in the older adventurer sets.
