I thought that is was really cool since I don&#39;t have any chrome- gold elements. This set came out 5 years ago, during the 55th&nbsp;anniversary of the LEGO brick. I think that it would have been better if they had waited to release&nbsp;this till this year for they 60th anniversary, but that is only my opinion.</p>

<p>The keychain it self seems to be made of a regular tan brick that was painted chrome-gold, then drilled into the side and had a keychain installed. There are bits of plastic sticking out on the inside from this process, but it doesn&#39;t bother me much.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that this set is for serious LEGO collectors&nbsp;who want a cool, one of a kind idem to display and to show off. A regular chrome-gold 2x4 brick has never been released in an official&nbsp;set, so this is truly a piece that people should be proud to own.</p>
