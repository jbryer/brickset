It's big and expensive, but if you can afford it it's a real treat.","<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is the set guys like me have been waiting for with the recent low number of Old Trilogy sets and the fact that low expectations were completely blown out of the water when the pics were revealed.<br>In an effort to write something from a different angle to
Cap'n Rex's excellent review I'll mix opinions of the sections of the set with
a review of the build in the order you build it, with the figures and an
overall take at the end. Hopefully there will be a little more detail than he
was able to put in for the sake of size, details of the build itself and the
like, and it'll be easy to navigate to any part you're interested in. (I.e. skip the ridiculously mammoth part and just look at the bullet points! Yep, I enjoy writing, and no, I don't expect many people to read it all! To think I criticised Cap'n for being verbose a while back...)</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">So, first, <b>the mammoth description of the build</b>:</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Bag 1</b> is a mixed bag with an <b>Imperial speeder bike</b>
and an <b>Ewok catapult</b>. (Sorry, bad pun, I couldn't resist!)<br>
<b>The speeder</b> is familiar, though it always seems to have something new.
The round 2x2 plate at the base of the front section is orange, though I can't
work out why. The arms for the handles are also dark brown; that seems strange
too, but the rest of the build has a lot of them so I imagine it's simple
economy - black wouldn't be worth it for just two pieces out of 71. The biggest
difference is the clear dish and round brick that elevate the bike, ironically
making the long needed and only recently introduced boat stud piece redundant!
It allows the skis to be tilted back to make it look like it's moving fast, but
it does overbalance forward easily, and it has to be on absolutely level ground
else it will tip over. Not so great, but not completely dreadful, and of course
you don't have to use it.<br>
<b>The catapult</b> is completely different and is very attractive with well
integrated slopes and shades of brown - a theme for the set. The way the dark
green leaves are used on the floor is novel and works very well, softening the
lines of the traditional baseplate. And the only hint of a mechanism, despite
the purely cosmetic ratchets, is a rubber piece that acts as a spring.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>The main build</b> is really engaging throughout with a
lot of variety within the repeated sections.<br>
The next two bags (<b>2 and 3</b>) contain <b>the first tree</b> you build. It's
the most simple of the four with the studs the right way up all the way
through. Finally, we all cry! A Lego tree that looks good! It's not just black
castle pieces or a tower of round bricks! The mix of slopes, the two shades of
brown with some orange thrown in, and various greenery (the 'three leaved round
stud' plant, the undead sort of pale green small leaf, dark green large leaf
and various dark green creepery sort of things) and especially the dark tan
printed mushrooms make the tree look superb. It's a sturdy build too, and the
sliding trapdoor and chute works well.<br>
The upper section (<b>bag 3</b>) is very similar to the later tree tops, but
they're so much further on in the build that by the time you get to them you've
forgotten! The rail is really well worked with a lower rail underneath the
platform with droid arms coming out to attach the main visible part. It holds
the shorter rail in place better than the later rails which tend to want to
straighten without a lot of work. The light tan area that makes up the entrance
to the hollow section looks really good next to the browns and oranges, recreating
the look of the clay (?) doorways really well. The double 1x6 arches make the
doorway look a lot more substantial than just one would have done, which is
typical of the quality feel of the build. The pair of dark tan leaves above the
door and with the large 1x8x3 orange arch at the back will become a familiar
theme. And the rope ladder is a bit fiddly to make (or maybe that's just me
being fastidious about keeping the rope from twisting) but works superbly well
dropping down to floor level and it very climbable for a minifigure.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The next three bags (<b>4, 5 and 6</b>) are each one of <b>the
three main tree sections</b>, each topped with red, blue or yellow to tell them
apart. I was a little taken aback on the first stump when as the build got to
around 4 bricks high the instructions told me to top it off with smooth tiles
all the way around. That's done so that the next section of the tree can be
created with plates on the side of the tree. A lot of very old style window and
door pieces and the like make up the central structure, and various bricks with
studs on the side go around at the relevant points. Plates are then adorned
with dark brown slopes and light brown wedges and stuck on to give the trees a
fantastic textured look. Each of the trees has a gap in the centre of the
bricks-upward base on two of the sides where dark brown 1x6 curves are attached
to integrate the lower section better with the studs-on-the-side section.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Each tree has its own feature that means that though you
realise you are essentially building the same thing three times each of them is
vastly different.<br>
The first (the <b>blue</b> tree, at the back right-angle corner) has a hinged
door near the base made from a light brown LURP leading to a weapon cabinet
(that oddly doesn't have any weapons in it and is too short for the two spare
spears you get!). So there's an entire side of the template carved out to make
that space, and the plate above the door is shorter than the others.<br>
The <b>red</b> tree (left corner, by the rope bridge) has a hole right down the
middle to allow for a spider's web to swing out (none of the tree stump
features is really from the films but this one's the most far-fetched!). That
means the side-facing studs have to be carefully worked with some pale green
1x1s thrown in to help, and the plates up the sides are split on two sides. I'm
a little disappointed that the web can't be entirely hidden, but I do like the
spider so I guess I can put up with the web!<br>
The <b>yellow</b> tree (the only one left! The front corner, with the net) has
a cavity like the first stump but a far bigger one, and it's up at the level of
the side facing studs with a couple of steps running up to it. The hinge is
above for one entire face to swing up, and the cavity itself is nicely shaped.
The sides and top are formed on the inside of the plates that make up the sides
with the new Studs-Not-On-Bottom pieces in light tan, and inverted slopes
sloping up to form the roof. The stickers on the SNOB pieces, two of only three
in the set, are really nice too with a heart carved and Leia's name written in
the Star Wars alphabet (""aurebesh"") on one side and a scout trooper
helmet with kill tally marks on the other. The larger cavity means the side
facing studs are trickier to create but the new
2x2x2/3-with-2-studs-on-the-side pieces are used well to compensate.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">There's a real shift of gear at this point with the three
stumps down and ready, and <b>bag 7</b> making the whopping <b>platform</b>. It
begins with an impressive Technic structure formed from the large 6x8
frame-like pieces and other similar parts; 10x10 octagonal plates with large
holes in the middle create sockets one the three corners of what is roughly
speaking a triangle, each colour coded to match the stumps, with a clip firmly
set to attach to clips at the tops of the stumps; the underside is given a
little covering; and finally the top is covered in dark tan.<br>
I attached the stumps at this point to elevate it for ease of reach and they
clip in very satisfyingly. <b>Bag 8</b> adds various parts to the platform in
what are essentially the gaps between the tree tops; the helmet drums are
brilliant (glad to have another of those black helmets, and the use of the
sandtrooper print is very clever); Han can be roasted over a fire that spins as
he knocks it; there are stakes to tie captured rebels to; and there's the
mystical floating chair. The chair is a little disappointing as its clear piece
is clipped on quite firmly - I'd hoped to be able to slide it up but it seems
that's not feasible so you have to just unclip it and move it.<br>
The last part of this section is the swinging hammers that work really well
and, though the 8038 AT-ST is far too tall, are reminiscent of the moment in
the film that the cockpit got crushed from each side. They can be let down and
reset over and over all by pushing the brown vine on the opposite side which
makes the feature really pleasing to use.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The last three bags (<b>9,10 and 11</b>) make up the
rotatable <b>tree tops</b> with the rope bridge right at the end. <br>
The first has a bedroom type area and steps up to a higher level with its own
railing and the light tan doorway at this level - perfect for Leia walking out
to see the Rebels trussed up for roasting, or just to have Chief Chirpa
surveying his village. The upper level has the set's only other sticker, almost
a blackboard schematic of a glider and a spear with more aurebesh writing
(implying the rebels drew it up?).<br>
The second if full of cooking equipment with a cauldron and sacks and pots of
carrots and sausages -fitting as the upper section is where the net trap is
operated from.<br>
The last is just a small hut with a stone fire in - plenty of room for Ewoks to
gather round so C-3PO can recount the story of the previous films and episode
VI so far! The lower roof has a flick-catapult on too.<br>
The ability to rotate these sections gives so much flexibility to displaying
this set and plenty of access for play too. I found the railings can catch and
make rotating them awkward, though when you realise which part is catching it's
easily solvable. And as with the first tree they are covered with various
greenery that make them look superb.<br>
<b>The rope bridge</b> is a bit of a fiddly end to the build, but it unites the
first tree to the main part, and in many ways with this feeling like an MOC it
is the part a lot of owners will be most keen to build so it's a fitting end to
the build.</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;<br><br></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>The figures</b> are superb, less than 10188, but 17
nonetheless!</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>The Ewoks</b> are all great, with three of the five being
new. I have to say I'm not so keen on the new Wicket as his facial printing
makes him look a little old, but I'll happily have him and treat him like
another nondescript Ewok! Teebo uses the same mould as Logray but the vastly
different printing really works. The mysterious ""Ewok Warrior"" is a
nice dark tan variant too. Put these five together with the 8038 three and the
couple from Ewok attack and, apart from having two identical Chief Chirpas and
Lorgays, you've now got quite a hoard of the little critters.<br>
<b>The Rebel soldiers</b> are a blend of the recent battle pack bodies, with
one of them having a ginger beard like in 8038, though it's a new double sided
print (maybe not brand new, but new to OT SW which is all I really know).
They're fine, not much to say, except that they don't have backpacks - possibly
so you can tie them up or roast them, and their hands are strangely light tan.
I can't fathom that colour choice, they look like surgical gloves! Strange!<br>
<b>The Imperial Troopers</b> are great. There's the same <b>Storm Trooper</b>
as the recent battle pack with sharper printing than the older version, and
it's nice to have two. And the <b>Scout Trooper</b> is a real treat - finally
he's got the right colour arms and legs for one thing! Again, nice to have two.
(Though I can't help but feel army building and refreshing all the old versions
you'll have is going to be nigh on impossible unless there's a surprise smaller
set with these figures coming up soon or you really, really like advent
calendars.)</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>The main characters</b> are everything you'd expect too.<br>
<b>Chewbacca</b> is, as always, the same as he's always been, and comes with a
great gun-metal bowcaster.<br>
<b>Han</b> is the same as in the recent A-Wing which was very well done.<br>
<b>C-3PO</b> is the newer version from the Droid Escape set (and I can't fathom
why he wasn't part of the recent Jabba the Hutt wave too, he's another that
I've got a dozen old versions that will all want refreshing now!), so a nice
shade of gold, printed eyes, and crisp printing on the body.<br>
<b>R2-D2</b> is the first of these that is new, finally having a metallic
silver dome, though the design of the print is unfortunately a little
cartoonish compared to previous versions. I'm happy about the colour upgrade,
but feel it's been traded off against the overall design. Still, if I've got a
dozen Chewbaccas and umpteen Threepios that's nothing on the number of Artoos
I've already got!<br>
<b>Luke</b> is another completely new black suit version. I don't know, you
wait for one for years (that's in a set that's cheaper than £250! Ah. This is
£200 isn't it. Ooops!) and three come along at once! He's very well printed
just as he appears at the end of the film, with the obligatory black hand. And
his hair is darker and I think suits the figure really well.<br>
<b>Leia</b> is the star of the figures, never seen in this form before, with a
fabric skirt (that annoyingly doesn't meet up well. I found it very hard to fit
well and wish it had an overlapping side to compensate for the inevitable gap)
and the long braided hair. Her determined face works well for not wanting to
believe what Luke's telling her, though unfortunately he doesn't have a face
that fits telling her!</p><p class=""MsoNormal""><br><br>One final detail worth noting is <b>how this set fits with other Endor sets</b>. (I asked about this in Cap'n Rex's review, I feel pretty thick for forgetting to mention it and having to edit it in!) Unfortunately, given how minifigure proportions make scaling Lego difficult, it doesn't fit too well, but <b>8038</b> illustrates the problem. The bunker looks tiny next to the village, not just far too short but too small overall. But the AT-ST from that set, which fits okay next to the bunker, makes the village look small, being too tall to fit under the platform or get squashed by the 'hammers,' and its chin being level with the rope bridge. So is it too big or too small? I guess I'd say it's just right in its own right, but combining it with the previous sets will take quite a lot of modification, either to the trees to add some height, or to the bunker to beef it up - doubly so if you do both.<br>The <b>Ewok Attack</b> set is of course far too small next to this set too, but it looked that way on its own anyway! And as Logray is the same in this set you'll only really be missing Tokkat. The recent <b>battle pack</b> is a pathetic attempt at a tree plus a speeder, so it also looks odd, though the tree was hardly the focal point of the set so ditching it or building its parts into the village is no big deal. There aren't as many Endor sets as I thought there were! (Ignoring older sets for the monotone Ewok era!)<br></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><o:p>&nbsp;<br><br></o:p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><b>Overall</b> then, this is a truly superb set. It
satisfies the long yearned for lack of decent Lego trees and can easily be a
Wookie or Elf village if Ewoks aren't your thing. I would expect that any
MOCers who want to make it taller will need to be proficient else it could look
clumsy, but to experienced MOCers it will present an exciting challenge.<br>
The other MOC concern of parts is well met with a fantastic selection. There
are plenty of useful parts too with a load of studs-on-the-side bricks of
various sizes, a number of plates with studs going both up and down (mostly up)
on the side, some of the new 2x2x2/3 stepped brick with 2 side studs, and a few
of the brand new 1x2 curve piece in that washed out green. Every shade of brown
from light tan down to dark brown is plentiful; there's lots of green leaves of
various types; there's even a nice little selection of food!<br>
The figures are all good and what you get is more than enough to recreate many
of the scenes.</p><p>





























</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The real triumph of the set though is how well the finished
article will please both AFOLs who want to display it and KFOLs who want to
play with it. In contrast to 10188 which I always saw as a bit of a curiosity
it looks superb as an overall set and from there is draws you in to admire all
the smaller details. And for play, there are tons of features. Each tree base
has its own (a chute, hidden weapons stash, spider's web and a hidey hole), the
platform and tree tops have more (the roasting spit, poles to tie up prisoners,
Threepio's rising chair, a small catapult and the net) plus nice areas for
recreating homely scenes (it's almost a doll's house!), and there's the speeder
and catapult for good measure. And as a long-time Star Wars fan I love how accurate the set is to the film is great, despite the obvious signs that the designer hasn't actually seen the film!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Really engaging build with a real MOC feel (that I described it so lengthily is proof!)</li><li>Fantastic array of pieces within the obvious forest brown bias</li><li>The finished model looks absolutely brilliant - perfect for AFOL display</li><li>The set is packed with fun features - perfect for KFOL play</li><li>A really good assortment of figures for scene setting, play and collecting</li><li>I still can't give it a 5, but given recent aboses and the now established norm for SW sets the value is pretty good</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Only that the high price will inhibit many younger fans who this set is perfect for, which can't be helped as the ambitious size is so much of what makes this set great</li></ul>
<p>You'll love building it; you'll love how it looks; you'll love the whole set up whether you play or display. It's worth the effort to save, and I expect it to be on many want lists for a long while to come. And if you're undecided may I be the unhelpful push you need and your bank account will resent? I'm glad I did! ;)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"TheBrickGuru","2013-11-08T11:03:53.46Z","Outstanding Across the Board","<p>I was lucky enough to have the old Ewok Village Kenner play set from the 80s and for those of us old enough to remember that must have toy of the ROTJ era it is clear where the Lego designers got much of their inspiration for this fabulous set.&nbsp; From the escape slide to the three trees joined by an inner platform, multiple huts and the various traps and details Lego has not only channelled their inner 1980s childhood selves but successfully improved upon a great play set.&nbsp; The following are what I found to be this set's greatest assets:</p>
<p><strong>Playability<br/></strong>At $250 this is definitely not an impulse set but it is worth it.&nbsp; As I built this set with my two young girls (a contingent of Lego Friends mini-dolls were the Ewok's first visitors, that made for a funny visual let me tell you!!) its greatest asset was immediately apparent: playability.&nbsp; As I built each tree and slowly raised the village up from the (large) pile of bricks scattered across the basement floor the girls started playing with each successive section.&nbsp; Each tree all by itself held enough play value to hold their attention for the 5 hours it took to put this together, and it has not gotten old since.&nbsp; From the hut with a bedroom, to the hut with a kitchen (very popular with my kids, who knew the Ewoks cooked cupcakes and apple pies!) this set has everything needed for a wide variety of play.&nbsp; If you want to fight Stormtroopers there are plenty of traps and weapons to make that happen.&nbsp; If you want to play Ewok daily life you can do that too.&nbsp; And if you want a bunch of Lego Friends to come over for a dance party complete with refreshments that is also no problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Crossover<br/></strong>I have a confession: I did not buy this set for my Star Wars collection.&nbsp; While I am a fan of the movies (and have a large Star Wars collection from having bought out a lot of collections on eBay) I am hardly a die hard fan.&nbsp; No, I bought this set for a theme that is about as far from Star Wars as you can get: my Islander's collection.&nbsp; I am planning on using this set in a Pirate diorama as the main home for King Kahuka and his tribe.&nbsp; And that fact illustrates this sets brilliance in an often overlooked aspect of Lego sets that I call crossover.&nbsp; Crossover is a set's ability to be at home in a different theme thereby dramatically increasing its playability.&nbsp; This set has loads of crossover.&nbsp; It could be a home for outlaws in a Castle setting, part of a theme park within City (anyone else remember the old Swiss Family Robinson tree house at Disneyland in the 80s?) or a ruin for archaeologists to explore. </p>
<p><strong>Minifigures<br/></strong>Ok, time for a second confession: I do not understand the minifigure craze that has engulfed the Lego world in the last few years.&nbsp; Maybe I am old school but to me minifigures are utilities, you need pilots and drivers and doctors to operate ships and occupy buildings but that is all. I ended up getting this set for free by cashing in VIP points for half of it and selling off the figures to pay for the second half (sacrilege!).&nbsp; Based on the prices people were willing to pay for these figures I can say with certainty that they are desireable!&nbsp; And if you want to offset the purchase price and are ok with an older version of Luke that you already have, well now you know my money saving secret!</p>
<p><strong>Solid Construction <br/></strong>Lego has gotten very good at making fewer pieces look like more.&nbsp; Lots of sets look great but don't feel hefty or solid when you are done with them.&nbsp; Not so with the Ewok Village, this thing is built like a tank.&nbsp; The trees are brilliantly constructed and very solid.&nbsp; My girls are not gentle on their Legos and this set has been able to handle everything they have thrown at it (sometimes literally).&nbsp; Even the tree branches are solid.&nbsp; The result is that you really feel like you are getting your money's worth when you build this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In conclusion this is an outstanding set that I would recommend to both kids and adults.&nbsp; If you want to play with your Lego sets you are going to be hard pressed to find a set with more playability.&nbsp; If you want to display sets this one looks highly impressive when complete.&nbsp; If mini-figures are your thing this set has some good ones (and if you want to offset the cost they are great at assisting!).&nbsp; </p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"CapnRex101","2013-12-10T18:29:04.063Z","Official Brickset review","<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608456036/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2884/9608456036_8c5f8e1102_n.jpg"" style=""float:left; margin:0 10px 5px 0"" /></a></p>

<p>Quite possibly&nbsp;the most anticipated set of the year has been this one, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10236-1"">10236</a> Ewok&nbsp;Village. The iconic location of Bright Tree Village from Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi has been notably absent in&nbsp;LEGO since the earliest Star Wars sets were released in 1999. Many fans have been eagerly awaiting and hoping for a set of this kind to be released, and at last, in the 30th anniversary year of the final episode of the Original Trilogy, LEGO have provided us with a definitive model of the Ewok Village. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have to say,&nbsp;I never fully saw the appeal of such a model. As far as I was concerned, an Ewok Village set would consist almost entirely of building trees, with only a tiny area of actual village at the top, as well as being extortionately expensive. While a model like this might have been an exquisite display piece, the playability of such a set would have been sorely lacking, and therefore I doubted a large Ewok Village would ever be produced.</p>

<p>I am pleased to say however that I was utterly mistaken. Now that LEGO have provided us with an&nbsp;Ewok Village, I am delighted with it. The model retains enough accuracy from the film to be credible as a village in the trees, and despite the aforementioned trees not actually being very tall, this does not take anything away from the appearance of the model as I had feared it would. Priced at &pound;199.99 or $249.99 and consisting of 1990-pieces, this set has been a very pleasant surprise, as not only does this model represent fantastic value for money in my opinion, as well as being excellent from a perspective of displayability, but it is even&nbsp;laden with exciting and innovative features in every area of the set.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this review could be a long one, so I suggest you make yourself comfortable...</p>

<hr />
<hr />
<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>This is a large set, and therefore it&nbsp;comes packaged in a large box. The artwork is very attractive, showing the Ewok Village being valiantly defended&nbsp;from the attacking Imperial forces. Despite this dangerous situation, I notice that Han is still being roasted on a spit, and the only member of the Rebel Alliance who seems to be making any attempt to assist the Ewoks in defending their home is R2-D2. All seventeen Minifigures are displayed in the gallery along the bottom of the box, and the green border which has adorned every Star Wars set this year runs along the top.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608610950/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7457/9608610950_69da12473f_n.jpg"" style=""height:261px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The back of the box shows the village, populated with the seventeen Minifigures, surrounded by images demonstrating the huge number of features which are incorporated into each tree and the village platform itself. There are also a few shots of scenes from the film recreated using the set, including the arrival of C-3PO as he is hailed as a god, and the Battle of Endor itself.</p>

<p>Inside one finds seventeen&nbsp;numbered bags, two unnumbered bags containing most of the larger pieces, and a loose dark tan&nbsp;8 x 16 plate. The three instruction manuals and tiny sticker sheet are backed with cardboard to keep them flat, which is always welcome.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Seventeen Minifigures are included in this set, eight of which are brand new. I have photographed some of the figures together in suitable groups, otherwise this review would consist of some fifty images which is more than are necessary in my opinion. It also means that I can include a few more photographs of the actual model, which is substantial, although to capture every angle is fairly challenging.</p>

<p>I will begin with the Rebel Alliance characters, the first of whom is a new&nbsp;<strong>Luke Skywalker</strong> in his black Jedi robes. This figure has been significantly updated since <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75005-1"">75005</a> Rancor Pit where he last appeared in his Episode VI outfit. His hair colour is the first thing which has been changed, from tan to dark tan, although the mould remains the same. His head is printed on two sides with a smiling expression&nbsp;and a grimace, just as it was in 75005, which looks great. I do not have a problem with it personally, but it is worth noting that Luke&#39;s chin printing is just about visible even when it should be concealed by the hairpiece so perhaps it would be best to avoid displaying him from the back as much as possible.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608598364/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5442/9608598364_e2f8747b05_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:287px"" /></a></p>

<p>His torso is printed with a brand new design on the front and back which includes a&nbsp;creased flap and buckled belt. The flap on his chest is partially folded down as seen in&nbsp;the film and there is a ring on which Luke hangs his lightsaber&nbsp;(although this is obviously not possible on the Minifigure). On the reverse of the torso is some more of the belt and a few creases in the robe.&nbsp;The detail of his gloved right hand has been captured and his legs are plain black with no printing. Naturally, Luke is armed with a green lightsaber.</p>

<p>Another brand new Minifigure is the excellent <strong>Princess Leia</strong>. This is the first time LEGO have produced a figure of Leia in this particular outfit and it looks fantastic in my opinion. Her hair was first seen in the Collectable Minifigures theme on the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=71000-15"">Forest Maiden</a> from Series&nbsp;9. Here however, rather than being cast in dark orange, it is instead dark brown which looks perfect in my opinion. The head is the same as has appeared on Leia Minifigures for several years now, with a smiling face on one side and a frustrated expression on the other, complete with eyelashes and red lips.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608594904/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7405/9608594904_ed35457f9a_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:280px"" /></a></p>

<p>Her torso is printed with a very simple dark tan dress, a florid bow and some flower details on the front and back. Leia wears an olive green fabric skirt which is torn and rugged. It does not quite link up perfectly all the way around, but it certainly achieves the desired appearance, and from the front it looks superb. The legs are printed with the same design as found on the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8831-1"">Swimming Champion</a> from the Collectable Minifigures, albeit in an olive green shade on this occasion. This design is entirely obscured by the skirt, but nevertheless its inclusion shows good attention to detail.</p>

<p>Next we have the ever-popular <strong>Han Solo</strong>, who is exactly the same as he appeared in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=75003-1"">75003</a> A-wing Starfighter. This is an excellent version of Han and is a huge step-up from previous editions in my opinion. His hairpiece is the same as ever, cast in reddish brown and looking fine as far as I am concerned. The head is printed with a single face, featuring a smirk and brown eyebrows. It is simple, but it certainly captures the cavalier character of Han Solo. His torso is printed with a huge amount of detail, including stitched pockets on the front and back of his jacket, as well as a creased white shirt which he is wearing underneath. His hips and&nbsp;legs are printed with a belt and holster for his weapon, which is a standard blaster pistol. All in all, a nice Minifigure, albeit a reasonably simple one.</p>

<p>Han Solo&#39;s constant companion <strong>Chewbacca</strong> is included too. An updated version of Chewbacca has been demanded for a couple of years now by fans, and although this figure is fine, I cannot help but agree to an extent. Having seen some preliminary images of the upcoming Winter Star Wars sets, it would appear that this wish is soon going to be fulfilled. As it stands however, this figure uses the same reddish brown&nbsp;head and torso component which is moulded with hair texturing&nbsp;and printed with a black&nbsp;nose as well as his silver bandoleer.&nbsp;This piece is placed over a plain reddish brown torso and his legs are also not&nbsp;printed. As usual, Chewbacca is equipped with a pearl dark grey crossbow which represents his Bowcaster very effectively.</p>

<p><strong>C-3PO</strong> is also found in this set, in an identical form to his appearance in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9490-1"">9490</a> Droid Escape. His head is the same mould as it has been since the character&#39;s first appearance in 2000, although printed with some yellow around his eyes. The torso is far more detailed than the previous edition, with the Powerbus cables visible beneath the power socket on his chest. His back is also printed with the cables visible through a gap in his golden plating, and the panel which Chewbacca is seen fiddling with as he attempts to repair C-3PO in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back. His legs are pearl gold, just like&nbsp;the rest of the figure, and have no printing on them.</p>

<p>As usual, with C-3PO comes <strong>R2-D2,</strong> who is an extremely common Minifigure, but a necessary inclusion nevertheless. Interestingly, this character has never before been seen quite like this, as his dome has only appeared once before in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8037-1"">8037</a> Anakin&#39;s Y-wing Starfighter from the Clone Wars series, while the&nbsp;cylindrical body section is the same as always. The dome is pearl silver in colour and is printed with a slightly simplified&nbsp;design compared with the standard piece, featuring his eye, holoprojector and a few tiny display icons as one would expect. The body section is printed with the various flaps and hatches which conceal tools in the film and have been a mainstay of R2-D2 as a Minifigure since 1999.</p>

<p>Lastly for the Rebel characters, we have two <strong>Rebel Commandos</strong>, who vary only in their face and torso designs. While one of them has appeared before in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9489-1"">9489</a> Endor Rebel Trooper &amp; Imperial Trooper Battle Pack, the other is a new combination of previously used pieces. The helmet for them both is highly detailed and is the same as it was in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8038-1"">8038</a> The Battle of Endor featuring a short brim and&nbsp;Comlink&nbsp;details on either side of the piece. The figure we have seen before utilises a head printed with a rather calm expression and brown eyebrows, while the other has a bushy ginger beard and a double sides face, with one fairly neutral&nbsp;expression and the other angry. This head design has appeared before on a Rohan Soldier in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9471-1"">9471</a> Uruk-Hai Army from the Lord of the Rings theme. One torso is printed with a dark tan jacket and identification badge, while the other is detailed with a fantastic camouflaged trench coat and bandoleer. Both have back printing too, a hood on one, and the rest of the bandoleer on the other. Their legs are plain sand green and they are each armed with a blaster rifle.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605352735/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5543/9605352735_5825b0b14d_n.jpg"" style=""height:248px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>I love these two figures, but&nbsp;my only suggestion&nbsp;would be to add a small backpack like the ones which appeared on the Commandos in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8038-1"">8038</a>. These consisted of a neck bracket and dark green tooth piece, which I liked. This is completely subjective however as many prefer&nbsp;figures to be without neck brackets as it does look a little odd sometimes as it extends the length of their neck.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605348939/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2827/9605348939_592517b26a_n.jpg"" style=""height:84px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>Next&nbsp;we have the title characters of the set, the Ewoks, the first of whom is <strong>Chief Chirpa</strong>. Although this particular character has little screen time in the film (despite being the leader of the Ewok tribe), he still plays a significant role in the film by committing the Ewoks to the fight against the Empire. He has appeared before in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8038-1"">8038</a> and this figure is identical, but nevertheless looks excellent. All five Ewoks are&nbsp;formed utilising a &#39;sandwich board&#39; piece over a plain torso with short legs. Chief Chirpa is predominantly light bluish grey and his face is printed with a&nbsp;dark bluish grey nose, grey lips, and black eyes. The reddish brown hood&nbsp;is detailed with a tooth hanging as a trophy and some string which can presumably be used to tighten the hood. His torso and short legs are plain light bluish grey, and he carries a staff which looks great to me.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608577882/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7460/9608577882_303a41a61a_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:284px"" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Logray</strong> is another Minifigure which has been released before, in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7956-1"">7956</a> Ewok Attack. This figure&nbsp;uses a different head and torso mould to Chief Chirpa, complete with a headdress and satchel moulded with his white and tan striped fur. On top of his head is a bird skull and his ears are poking out on either side of the brown cloth he has draped over his head. There are some feathers and small charm decorations moulded into the piece, and it looks absolutely fantastic as a whole. His torso and legs are plain tan in colour and Logray is armed with a staff, marking him out among the Ewoks as the Shaman of the tribe.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608575230/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3703/9608575230_e20c28f121_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:299px"" /></a></p>

<p>The third Ewok we have is a new version of <strong>Wicket W. Warrick</strong>, now in his third outing as a LEGO Minifigure. This character is of course the most important Ewok in the film as it is he who initially discovers Leia lost in the forests of the moon of Endor. He is the same as the version of him from 2009 in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8038-1"">8038</a> but for his face which is now printed with some dark tan highlights around his mouth and eyes. His hood is reddish brown in colour and printed with a stitched design as though it has been repaired. His torso and legs are reddish brown, and Wicket is equipped with a dark brown spear. It might interest some to hear that this spear is a slightly updated version from usual, now with a flat butt end. This may seem like a minor change, but it will doubtless allow for more applications in MOCs as it can now be placed on its end in a 1 x 2 jumper plate or the like.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605342719/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5534/9605342719_39f7607475_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:290px"" /></a></p>

<p>Another Minifigure which is included is the rather mysterious <strong>Ewok Warrior</strong>. After a great deal of research, I have only been able to find one Ewok who matches this figure for fur and hood colours, named <a href=""http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Nho'Apakk"">Nho&#39;Apakk</a>. I would presume that this is the character on which this Minifigure was based, and this would make perfect sense since he is seen utilising a catapult in the film and a catapult is included here. The Minifigure has an olive green hood, which is printed with some brown stitching much like Wicket&#39;s hood, and dark tan fur. His legs and torso are also dark tan, and the Ewok Warrior carries a small bow and arrow.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605340519/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7340/9605340519_d191646d6d_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:270px"" /></a></p>

<p>The final Ewok included is by far my favourite, <strong>Teebo</strong>. Not only is this the most detailed Minifigure of all, as well as being fairly significant in the film, but the character&nbsp;is also a favourite of mine as he was the first Star Wars action figure I ever owned. The mould used for Teebo&#39;s head and torso is the same as that of Logray, although he is printed very differently so you would not necessarily notice this if you placed them side by side. His headdress is dark orange in colour and is adorned with a Gurreck skull. Teebo&#39;s fur is striped in light and dark bluish grey, and his pouch is dark brown. His torso and legs are dark bluish grey, and he is armed with a dark brown spear like Wicket.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two <strong>Stormtroopers</strong> are included in the Ewok Village as well, who have only appeared once before in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9489-1"">9489</a>. These looks excellent, with a detailed helmet which is printed with the mouth grille and various vents. Their heads are mostly black but are&nbsp;printed with some slight stubble and an evil smirk which looks great. The torso is highly detailed and has been greatly improved from the earlier design, now featuring a belt and&nbsp;the tiny displays which are visible beneath the gap in the armour on their chest. The back of the torso is printed with a Thermal Detonator strapped to the belt and some more armour detailing. The legs are plain white with black hips, and each Stormtrooper is armed with a standard blaster. &nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605333979/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5458/9605333979_ecaef29e85_n.jpg"" style=""height:203px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>Last of all are the brand <strong>Scout Troopers</strong>, which have received a huge update since their inclusion in <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=9489-1"">9489</a>. The helmets have remained the same as always, with a gap in their visor which is filled in by the black head beneath. On the back of the head is the same face as is found on the Stormtroopers with stubble and smiling expression, which can be turned around to face the front should you wish to remove his helmet and display the Minifigure like that. The changes are found on his torso and legs, which are both printed with a far more accurate design than the original figure. His torso is printed on the front and back with armour details including pouches for storing various items of equipment and the backpack which presumably contains rations and the like. The hips and legs are printed with a continuation of this design, but are mostly black as in the film, so it is great to see this improved accuracy. As a whole, this is a brilliant Minifigure and he looks great on a speeder bike as you will see later in the review.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>Constructions of this set is a very enjoyable experience. It took about four and a half hours to complete and kept one interested throughout as various building techniques and construction methods are utilised. The trees are created quite ingeniously by placing large pieces such as door and window frames inside for stability, and using SNOT techniques to produce an organic and realistic appearance for the tree bark. Furthermore, the trees are in fact colour coded for ease of construction. These bright colours are hidden once the set has been built, but it is useful in the instructions to be able to differentiate&nbsp;between the trees much more easily, which actually look fairly similar as a whole.</p>

<p>In the small catapult which is included, a rubber piece is used to give the kick as seen in the film which is a nice touch in my opinion. Railings are formed around the platforms using cable pieces which must be bent into shape, and although this is time consuming and a little difficult, it produces a very attractive effect in the end. Lastly, and perhaps most obviously from images, is the construction of the rope bridge, which is outstanding. It creates an excellent brick-built bridge and looks very accurate when compared with the film. Overall, this is one of the more enjoyable builds I have experienced in a Star Wars set and there are a plethora of delightful techniques which will no doubt be new to many.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>This model looks marvellous when completed. I cannot fully explain why, as the accuracy to the movie is lacking, but this design works perfectly, negating the need for extremely tall trees while still retaining an attractive appearance. This set is reminiscent of <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10188-1"">10188</a> Death Star in that it captures multiple scenes from different points in the film, and it does so very effectively, seamlessly&nbsp;including the drums from the celebration at the end of the film beside the fire for cooking the captured Rebels earlier in the movie.</p>

<p>I will begin however with the first items to be built, a catapult for the Ewoks, and a speeder for the Imperials. The speeder is very similar to previous versions which have appeared just about every year since 2009, using a tricycle chassis component to form the rear half of the vehicle. A backpack adorns this section&nbsp;for storing supplies, and the front is fairly durable, maintaining the 2 x 1 Technic connector which has created a much stronger structure for the stabilisers&nbsp;at the front of the vehicle in recent years. A Scout Trooper (or anybody else) can easily be placed in the driving seat and control the speeder using the handlebars which can be held by the Minifigure. A small stand is included which raises the speeder off the ground a little, making for a great display piece should you wish.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608459032/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3797/9608459032_ea1398c064_n.jpg"" style=""height:161px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The catapult is a nice inclusion, and I like how 1 x 1 cylinders can be launched using a rubbery piece which acts like a spring, building tension&nbsp;as you press it down until it is released by letting it go. It can comfortably launch a cylinder two feet, and probably much more if you adjust it a little. Wheels are found on either side of the model which act as tension wheels, although they do not actually function, being present only for the sake of appearance. There is some greenery liberally dispersed about the model and a&nbsp;container for the rocks to be hurled is even included too.</p>

<p>Next comes the tree which is isolated from the other three and is only connected to the main village area by the rope bridge. This section has a rope ladder which is seemingly the only way up into the trees and a small hut on the top, which is empty of furniture. There are a few mushrooms at the foot of the tree, and various pieces of foliage which adorn the top of the tree. Should you wish, there is a space where one could place a Minifigure or two on top of the hut. The only feature to speak of in this area is found inside the hut, where by pulling back on a lever behind the tree, a trapdoor can be opened allowing the Ewoks to quickly escape to&nbsp;ground level via a slide. This function is well hidden and works perfectly, so is a welcome addition in my opinion.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605316549/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3680/9605316549_06abe8fa30_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:246px"" /></a></p>

<p>On the rope bridge across to the rest of the village are nine 2 x 2 plates with central stud, so one can place a Minifigure here without it falling over. The length and shape of the bridge can be adjusted by changing how far the smaller tree is from the main section. Personally, I prefer the bridge to be fairly taut, but this can of course be modified&nbsp;according to your own preference.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605308731/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5530/9605308731_bf2115218c_n.jpg"" style=""height:160px; width:320px"" /></a></p>

<p>The central&nbsp;village area is constructed across three trees, each of which include their own features and design touches. The first of these three contains two levels of huts on the top, and a spider web&nbsp;feature beneath, which can be pushed out to ensnare any unwelcome guests. A spider is placed on the side of the tree and the web remains well hidden when it is retracted into the trunk of the tree. The entire top section can swivel all the way around and there are steps from the lower floor to the upper which run around the tree. The same railings are constructed here as were found on the last tree section, and inside the lower level is a small bed with a table beside it. On the upper floor a bow is clipped to the wall and there is a diagram with images of the Ewok glider from <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=8038-1"">8038</a> and a spear. Written in Aurebesh beside the glider are the words &#39;skin glider&#39; and next to the spear it reads &#39;pointy way up.&#39; I think this a lovely touch, albeit utilising a sticker to do it. There is a small area on top where one can place a Minifigure much like on the first tree and a number of leaves are placed up here as well to achieve the appearance of a forest canopy. Flaming torches are spread around the area, as will become a theme in the remainder of the village.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605304617/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5331/9605304617_820b64515d_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:195px"" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608466136/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2891/9608466136_6e31555674_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:240px"" /></a></p>

<p>The next tree is the shortest of all. It can rotate just like the others and inside is a fire, which is presumably the area where C-3PO tells stories to the Ewoks in the film. On top is a catapult with some ammunition and beneath the village platform is a hatch in the tree where one can store some weapons on two clips.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9608529164/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7393/9608529164_678bfeb1ec_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:273px"" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605290603/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7351/9605290603_6ef786fb35_n.jpg"" style=""height:320px; width:175px"" /></a></p>

<p>Another three-level tree completes the quartet, with a hiding spot for a Minifigure down at the bottom of the tree. In here two more stickers are used, one with a Scout Trooper helmet and some sixty-three tally marks around it (that means there are a lot of helmet drums I suppose) and the other with the word &#39;Leia&#39; written in Aurebesh surrounded by a heart. I do not really consider Han Solo the sentimental type, but here is some hard evidence which suggests otherwise. The tan plates and slopes used in this area do an excellent job of creating a carved wooden feel, as though the tiny hiding place really has been etched straight out of the tree trunk.</p>

<p>On the upper level are two huts, one of which contains a bag of food items and a cauldron, while the upper level seems to act as storage for carrots and sausages for cooking. In here is also a sack which was introduced in the Collectable Minifigures theme. The net which was used to capture the rebels in the film hangs from this tree, and it can be raised and lowered simply by pulling it as it is threaded through the tree. There are various leaf details all over the huts and more torches inside and out, just like every other tree.</p>

<p>The majority of the action however is found on the large platform which stretches between three of the trees. Here are two sets of drums (one of which recreates the famous helmet drums), two barrels containing drum sticks, as well as a spit on which one can roast Han Solo. Cleverly, as a Minifigure is rotated on the spit, the fire beneath turns as the figure touches it, giving the impression of flickering flames. Whether or not this was intentional on the part of the designer, as I presume it must have been, it is a great little feature. Towards the back of the village are two poles to which one can fasten Minifigures as in the film.</p>

<p>Behind here is another Ewok defence mechanism.&nbsp;Should a speeder bike go between these two trees, hammers can be released&nbsp;(seen in the photo below to the right) to crush the vehicle by pulling on a brown vine from the front of the platform.</p>

<p>C-3PO&#39;s wooden throne is placed between the third and fourth trees, and a translucent pole can be moved up and down to give the illusion that he is levitating, as he does in the film, as Luke uses the force to life the throne. This seat can be lifted by Ewoks from the front and back and there are numerous torches which surround it, giving whoever is placed in the seat a rather regal atmosphere. Lastly, beneath the trees are two sections of greenery and mushrooms which can be placed between the trees. These can easily be removed if you prefer and the model looks great with or without them.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>There is no such thing as a perfect set as far as I am aware, but this model comes closer than most. The Minifigure selection is superb, but in a rare occurrence for a Star Wars set, they play second fiddle here to the village itself in my opinion.</p>

<p>Not only does the set look fantastic on display, but it is also a lot of fun to play with and the price is about right as far as I am concerned. The only suggestions I would make would be to add another Ewok or two and perhaps create some kind of mechanism which would allow us to recreate the scene where Chewbacca is lured into an Ewok trap. The net is already present but I think that the inclusion of a small brick built lure of some kind and the ability to lift the net off the floor and close it at the pull of a cord would make the set complete.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/92090133@N04/9605239491/"" title=""10236 - Ewok Village by Brickset, on Flickr""><img alt=""10236 - Ewok Village"" src=""http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5481/9605239491_17d5a72dd4_n.jpg"" style=""height:150px; width:300px"" /></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless these minor complaints pale into insignificance beside the rest of the set, as there are so many touches to delight fans of both Star Wars and LEGO, including detailed moments from the film, and some interesting building techniques. All of this created by Marcos Bessa who claims not even to have seen the film. After <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=10937-1"">10937</a> Batman: Arkham Asylum Breakout, <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79111-1"">79111</a>&nbsp;Constitution Train Chase and now this, I look forward to seeing what Marcos has coming out next.</p>

<p>Parts: <strong>5</strong> - If you are looking for foliage in colours of brown and dark tan, no set will better this one. There are some olive green 1 x 2 bows which are new and only appear in a couple of sets as well as&nbsp;a few desirable accessories too.</p>

<p>Playability: <strong>5</strong> - There are almost innumerable features and plenty of fun to be had recreating movie scenes as well as creating your own Ewok adventures (although if you have seen the Star Wars: Ewoks television&nbsp;show I imagine you have had more than enough of those).</p>

<p>Building Experience: <strong>5</strong> - One of the most entertaining builds I have experienced for a long time, there is plenty to maintain interest.</p>

<p>Value for Money: <strong>5</strong> - I think this set offers excellent value as you certainly feel as though you get a great deal for your money, including an impressive seventeen Minifigures!</p>

<p>Overall: <strong>5</strong> - No issues of any significance in my opinion, there may be other sets more suited to younger builders, but I think this is an ideal set for just about any fan of LEGO or Star Wars and it goes some way towards making up for the lack of Original Trilogy sets this Summer.</p>

<p>I have one final note. My set had an extra small bag inside the sixth bag of parts. I presume this is unique to my copy of the set, but if anybody else has had a similar experience, post as such in the comments below.&nbsp;</p>

"Bycougars","2014-07-28T01:36:42.393Z","The Battle of Endor","<p>This is a great set for any Star Wars fan especially for those who like the battle of Endor.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box was designed great, the forest scene looks great with the green Yoda box. The instructions are good, although it would have been nice to have bound instructions for this large of a set rather than having 4 separate manuals.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Comes with great variety of parts and has plenty of good pieces that can be used for building any type of forest scene. Lots of brown and green pieces that I think are very useful when building custom sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are fantastic in this set! You get 17 minifigures and a great variety. I really liked that there are 5 ewoks, 2 stormtroopers, and 2 scout troopers so it gives you a good amount of figures for a battle. You also get newer versions of almost all of the main charachters.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really enjoyed the build. Had some good building techniques.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks fantastic. Has to be one of the best looking Star Wars sets. Definitely is a good representation of the Ewok Village.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I think that this is a fantastic set, probably one of my favorite sets that I own. Probably second only to the Tower of Orthanc. Great set with a lot of minifigures. Possibly the only complaint is that as far as price per piece this set is a little expensive for what you get. However, with the amount of minifigures and the detail of the set you can&#39;t complain too much.</p>

"Mr_T","2017-03-08T05:11:01.007Z","Very solid playable set","<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Highly playable&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Great features, including some of the most iconic ones from the movie (the net and the two trunk traps)</li>
	<li>A lot of small hidden features: trap door, hidden doors, hidden weapon cache, rotating trunks, the various rungs integrated into the tree, floating throne, etc.</li>
	<li>The bridge is a very clever build</li>
	<li>The scenery pieces are nice and well numbered: pots, torches, Imperial helmets, throne, cooking fire, etc</li>
	<li>Loved the mini selection, specially for kids with so many Ewoks, including the six main characters (Luke, Leia, Han, Chewbacca, R2 and C3P0)</li>
	<li>It greatly captures the feel of how the Ewoks use gorilla tactics to fight off scouts (Imperial or otherwise), with its many traps, hidden doors, the hollow trunk (with a trap door)</li>
	<li>Very few bad angles, if any, and pretty much no exposed structural parts</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The foliage&nbsp;on top of the trees doesn&#39;t work for me. It&#39;s just not lush enough to capture the canopy properly and feels a bit bare</li>
	<li>I think the vegetation around the roots could have been 2-3 studs wider with a few more scenic elements in it</li>
	<li>Part count feels a little inflated (71 droid arms!), on a set which already has a very high price per piece</li>
	<li>Price is USD50 too expensive</li>
	<li>Chewbacca in this set is my least favorite minifig&nbsp;of all of my SW figures. It looks dull with almost no contrast to highlight its features</li>
	<li>Bad guys could have had a second speeder bike for more playability</li>
</ul>
