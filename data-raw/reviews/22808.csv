With that said, I was a bit confused as to what this was representing. Being from USA, I am unfamiliar with this tradition. Looking up the event online, it shows it is quite common in Europe (which it is a European toy).</p>

<p>Either way, I like it. It is a collection of smaller builds making up a bigger Christmas market. Since it is disjointed, it does look much smaller than what the piece count represents. But when all put together, it has a lot of little details that are quite fun to enjoy. Plus, it has a great price/piece ratio.</p>

<h2><strong>Pros:</strong></h2>

<p>-Clever use of gears to make the game and the carousel connect with the crank. (My favorite part).</p>

<p>-Great representation of what I&#39;d expect a winter market to look like.</p>

<p>-Colors used for roofing bring out those pops of color. Although I do miss the all white roofs from the early series.</p>

<p>-New horse print!</p>

<p>-New candy cane print for a lollipop.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Cons:</strong></h2>

<p>-Constant minifigure torso re-use! Why can&#39;t we get some variety? I only purchase Modulars and Winter Village for City themed sets and I have all of the torsos/heads a few times over.</p>

<p>-Disjointed appearance. Maybe putting it all onto a larger white baseplate might help give the connected feeling.</p>

<p>-Another lamppost design? really? At least it looks decent, but no consistency is upsetting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Overall:</strong></h2>

<p>Price may feel a bit steep, but it is worth it in the end. A very enjoyable set. I don&#39;t normally play with sets, but my daughter had a fun time with the carousel.</p>

"sudorum","2017-12-31T22:19:20.113Z","Turn of the New Year","<p>Another year, another winter set. Instead of ordering the new&nbsp;holiday train station which was backordered on lego.com, I had&nbsp;to settle with an older set that I missed out on when it was first released in 2013.&nbsp;It includes nine minifigures, which is more than would I tend to expect&nbsp;from a winter themed set. There are some interesting head pieces&nbsp;here that weren&#39;t featured in many sets&nbsp;at the time; these include&nbsp;a black beret, a pony tail hair piece&nbsp;previously featured in a Prince of Persia&nbsp;set, and a black hair bun that was used on&nbsp;the Flamenco dancer of the&nbsp;2012 collectible minifigure collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The market is composed of three&nbsp;stands, a carousel ride, a bench, and three freestanding tables. The first stand is a baker&#39;s unit with pastries, croissants, and a pie. The second station&nbsp;is for&nbsp;grilling&nbsp;chicken wings and sausages. The third&nbsp;includes peppermint candy sticks and some other unidentifiable confections. Fortunately&nbsp;all the stands have varying structures to prevent a monotonous build, but at the same time&nbsp;they are not so diverse as to feel incongruent from one another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The carousel is obviously the highlight, and part two of the build is dedicated to its construction. A crank at the top of the ticket booth turns the carousel through a series of interconnected gears located beneath the carousel and behind the ticket clerk.&nbsp;I was pleasantly&nbsp;surprised to find that the two horse seats&nbsp;rock up and down as the carousel turns. There are four green sloped&nbsp;pieces located on each end of the carousel and&nbsp;beneath the turning platform&nbsp;to facilitate this rocking motion. A green&nbsp;sleigh and a blue sled fill out the ride. The carousel is topped by&nbsp;alternating blue and white paper&nbsp;sheets, and although this&nbsp;looks great, I worry that the paper may&nbsp;waste away&nbsp;over time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a solid though not spectacular set, and&nbsp;honestly feels like more of the same from Lego&#39;s holiday theme. There are the same light posts from previous&nbsp;sets and another bench with kids and a cat. An emphasis on the&nbsp;festival fairground portion of the set over the&nbsp;market portion&nbsp;might have improved the set&#39;s playability as well as its originality.&nbsp;</p>

"DrFrankenstein","2015-03-02T19:29:20.183Z","Delightful winter fair","<p>The fifth set in the Winter Village series is a departure from the pattern established in the first four sets - a house and its surroundings. Here we are looking at a carnival that could be staged in a town square or a park. While this does not mix as well with the previous sets in my opinion, it is nevertheless a refreshing change in pace. Every mini-building in this set is quite well done with the carousel being particularly delightful. The little crank on the roof of the booth next to the carousel operates both the carousel and the turntable with buckets behind the white-bearded minifig - it operates easily, although the carousel does make some swishing noise due to the floor plates sliding against the base. Two horses on the carousel rock back and forth too, which is a nice touch. My favorite out of the free-standing stands is the barbeque stand with its grill and chimney tucked in the back.</p>

<p>The build is quite straight-forward with the seller stands being very enjoyable. The carousel build can get a bit repetitive at times, but it&#39;s the nature of the beast when you are making something round with lots of symmetric decorations. The colors in the set are very nicely coordinated, and the parts selection is nice too (horses, teddy bear, kitten, etc). There is no lack of the usual suspects for the Winter Village sets - white plates, pine trees, and lots of minifigs.</p>

<p>The Winter Village Market makes a neat display in and of its own. It&#39;s a bit louder and more colorful than the previous sets, but not excessively so. All in all, this is a great set to cheer the family up for the winter holidays.</p>

"HarleyMeenen","2017-01-30T02:59:01.38Z","Great for Show, Not for the Build","<p>Now that I&#39;m finished with it and able to admire it, I love this set. It comes together nicely into a fabulous display. Each section has unique elements with different build techniques and nice details.</p>

<p>The set comes with a nice number and variety of minifigures. It is a bit different in that all of the minifigures are actually given placements in the instructions; of course they can be moved and changed, but it is an interesting difference from other sets. The ony problem I had was that two of the heads are exactly the same- granted, one is covered by a beard so it isn&#39;t really noticeable, but I was disappointed by the lack of effort in including more variety.</p>

<p>The obvious centerpiece is the mini-carousel, and it is fantastic. The horses and chariots all look great, and I was thrilled to find that the horses actually rocked up and down like a real merry-go-round. It comes together beautifully, has the bonus of being interactive, and is a definite attention-grabber. My only problem was the canvas, which I had trouble getting to sit in a way that looked right. Overall, however, I was very pleased with it (on a personal note, I dream of getting the Grand Carousel, and was ecstatic to have this in the interim.)</p>

<p>All of that being said, the build is far from my favorite. Quite the opposite, it is incredibly tedious. It&#39;s unavoidable with a build of this sort, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I don&#39;t look forward to the idea of doing it again; in fact, this may be the first set that I opt to disassemble in pieces so as to not have to redo it every year. There are a huge number of small parts and repeated sections. Considering it takes hours to build, I would have like a little more variety.</p>

<p>While I quickly became bored and a bit frustrated with the process of building this set, I am incredibly happy with the end result. It is eye-catching and fun, and everything comes together nicely for a cohesive set with great mechanics. I look forward to putting this out front and center every winter.</p>

"Gerbil","2015-07-05T20:10:23.54Z","Not just for winter!","<p>I purchased this set as my first in the winter village line. I came very late to this and frankly, 2014&#39;s Santa set just didn&#39;t appeal to me, so instead of having a dedicated winter-themed display, I wanted this to merge into my current city collection.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>All standard stuff, which is to say, beautiful. The back of the box contains various smaller images of the lively events at the market.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A great selection naturally. Highlights include the 2 horses, a fair amount of gold tiles and some trees (I&#39;m not a fan of them particularly, but I haven&#39;t got any in years, so it was a pleasant change for me). There&#39;s a lot of tiny decorative tiles, which would be very useful for detailed MOCs I&#39;m sure.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A decent variety, although I&#39;m not a fan of so many kid figures - unbending legs get on my nerves after a while. The details on the adult figures though are lovely, including gold trim and older style clothing which makes them stand out. Some are winter-specific, with scarves etc printed on the clothing, but they will blend in well enough with my city anyway, I can just say their wearers are hypochondriacs scared of the wind!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing inspiring. The only relatively unusual part of the set is the rotation mechanism for the carousel coupled with the tilting action for the horses, which in all honesty needs to be extremely well balanced and tweaked to not catch and make the carousel rotation a little sticky. None of the models are big enough to cause boredom from repetition, but on the other hand they don&#39;t provide any actual &#39;wow&#39; moments either.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is slightly unusual in that it is made up of so many smaller sets - even the center piece is not particularly large, but they do add up to a very nice atmosphere. I imagine this would look amazing combined with the earlier winter village sets. The various individual stands all have their own personality and the large number of extra pieces (lamps, trees, tables etc) add a great deal of flexibility to it.<br />
My only complaint really is that using the big gear as the rotating table looks quite ugly. I can see a small modification coming for this...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&#39;It&#39; looks great all together, but I bought this for my city layout, which changes with the seasons. Removing most of the snow effects was simple enough, although there were a few places where the snow tiles were actually reinforcing the structures, so replacements rather than removal was needed. Together with the 2015 Ferris Wheel #10247 I have the beginnings of a very lively fair (just need the 2014 Fairground Mixer #10244 and hopefully each year another ride will come out), and despite the massive scale difference between the sets, visually they blend remarkably well.<br />
<br />
A minor nag for me: I don&#39;t think of this as a market at all. This, to me, is simply part of the annual fairs that travel (or used to) around the countryside in Britain. The stands, although more numerous than the carousel, are not the focus of this set, so I shall continue to call it (both in my mind and accidentally at times online) the winter village fair!</p>

"Windsorlego","2019-12-10T11:55:51.557Z","Up & down we go on the roundabout","<p>I rather enjoyed making this set.&nbsp; The most complex part was the roundabout.&nbsp; More of that in a moment.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t see any parts that I regarded as new or unusual but this set came out six years ago so perhaps there were at the time.</p>

<p>The set has nine minifigs&nbsp;which was a good number.&nbsp; Four of these were stall holders, two were on the roundabout, one having a cup of coffee and two children playing with the cat on the bench.</p>

<p>Each of the stalls had different ways of making their roofs which I enjoyed.&nbsp; A couple of them had studs around the edges to add a bit of interest.&nbsp; I also liked the addition of the green 2x2 round plates to which were added red 1x1 studs.&nbsp; The trees also added greenery to the overall look.</p>

<p>I got stuck trying to put the clear lamp globes together.&nbsp; I just couldn&#39;t get them to click together so I abandoned them and made my own lamp posts.&nbsp; I used the black cone provided as the base, added four black 1x1&nbsp;round bricks (3062) and put a bar 6L (63965) through the middle with the stop ring at the top.&nbsp; To that I added a black 1x1 brick with one stud which accommodated the green flotation ring with red 1x1 stud. I finished off with adding a 1x1 black stud, a 2x2 black radar dish slope down, a 1x1&nbsp;trans yellow&nbsp;round brick, a 1x1&nbsp;trans yellow stud and topped it off with a white 3x3 radar dish slope down.</p>

<p>I then moved on to the main build which was the roundabout.&nbsp; This is quite complex and I needed to pay careful attention to what I was doing.&nbsp; I did manage to miss some of the steps but fortunately caught them before I had moved too far on.The colour combination for this worked really well.&nbsp; Some of this part is quite fiddly and time consuming but worth it for the end result.</p>

<p>The middle section of the roundabout involves quite a bit of work making four lots of lights and the red support on top.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got stuck when trying to attach the frame that is made at Section 40 Page 59 of booklet 2.&nbsp; I therefore attacked it differently by dismantling the frame and started with putting the 2x2 grey&nbsp;plates with pins into the top of the four&nbsp;grey&nbsp;columns first.&nbsp; Then I added the black 1x10 and grey&nbsp;1x8 plates attaching them to the corner grey plates and making sure they went in between the white and tan tiles.&nbsp; The red corner plates were added last.&nbsp; This method worked better for me.</p>

<p>The final bit was to make the decorative band round the top of the roundabout.&nbsp; Again time consuming making all the elements that make the band up but it looks great once fixed on. Then the last bit was making the top bit that held the blue and white canopy parts.&nbsp; I turned the handle that made the roundabout go round and enjoyed seeing the horses go backwards and forwards.</p>

<p>All in all a very enjoyable build which will take time to do due to its complexity.&nbsp; If you can find this anywhere to buy then I would recommend you do so.&nbsp; It is well worth it.</p>
