She has already got her big brothers 50 litre tub of duplo so we had to get something &quot;girly&quot; for her.
The figures in the new duplo sets are more detailed than the last ones and the cart, pony, bush and trough make a great addition to an already overstocked duplo collection.
The cheap price makes it great for a kids surprise, gift or an extra to add to a tub basic blocks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
