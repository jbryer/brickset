This Polybag from 2013 is pretty fun actually and here's why.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The build is relatively new to me, uses a lot of nice tricks to evoke the look of a Christmas Tree with lights and presents underneath it. 
<li>Transparent Green Starfish for the Tree topper is a nice looking piece in a unique colour. 
<li>Lot's of nice green and red pieces for festive MOCs.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>None really to speak of.</li></ul>
<p>Overall I think this is a really good looking mini-model that works great for the holidays. It has a very interesting build technique that works a lot better than the older Christmas Tree I picked up a few years ago, it's a much sturdier build. And the presents under the tree are pretty impressive looking, I'd recommend nabbing this set if possible.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
