<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>No box - what did you expect, it's a polybag with one picture and some Warning-texts on it. Instructions are small and folded, advertising the 60023 Starter Set. So, nothing special.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>44 parts + 4 extras - that's a quite nice amount comparing to other polybag sets. They are small, useful ones, including some Technic parts and lime green coloured elements. Sadly, no accessories for our little gardener.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Strangely, the gardener wears a mechanic outfit which could be seen 4 years earlier in the road rescue sets. (Maybe he is the gardener of the town park? Or he works in a football stadium? Who knows.) Probably a torso with overalls-painting would be better. Our guy is smiling - he looks young and contented with his job. His lime green cap is quite rare, and looks good with the also lime green vehicle.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It takes ~2 minutes. Nothing special there.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The lawn mower is very neat and good-looking, but not too realistic. I like the design of the front with the Technic elements. The headlights are attached simply but nicely, and the two round parts rotate while pushing the vehicle on a FLAT object. It does not work perfectly on a carpet, a sofa or even on studs. The back is well-designed as well, and we have a steering wheel and a controller arm(?) to drive the lawn mower. (Note: The front wheel-holders are wider as the rear wheels.)<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p title=""6,62$""><input title="""" value=""This set is well-designed, playable and neat, but not so realistic and overpriced. (In my country it costs ~6,62$.)

"Odeinoichus","2013-10-23T07:16:14.96Z","New to LEGO City","<p><strong>Set #30224 Ride-On Lawn Mower: </strong>There is only one word to describe this Polybag, Unique.</p>
<p>LEGO City is notorious for having a lot of same elements, you have your Police, your Fire Rescue, your Ambulance and Hospital (in smaller numbers) and any other sort of familiar, rarely different designed builds. With this Polybag however LEGO has given fans of the City Theme a brand new, never before seen, vehicle for a City Display.</p>
<p>The Ride-On Lawn Mower is a small fun and easy to construct build with some interesting design choices, using a few technic style pieces it even has rotating blades for cutting the grass in LEGO City. It has some nice lime green colored parts with your standard medium stone grey and black and doesn't really have any rare parts I can see. However the build is spectacular, creative and ideal for the vehicle they're emulating.</p>
<p>The included Mini-Figure is also a standard found in similar sets, although I'm not sure if the parts have been used together like this before. I don't keep up with City as often as I used to. Not much printing on him, your standard face print smiling LEGO man from City and a single-sided torso with a blue jacket with orange stripes and a visible sweater underneath. Plain, but works well with the Lawnmower.</p>
<p>Overall I'm glad to see another new Polybag with a bit more variety, the Helicopter I reviewed previously may have been similar to past sets, but it stood out as a fun interesting new build design. And this set is in a similar vein, it features a new piece of equipment to add to the City display, and doesn't cost too much. Strongly recommend getting a few of these if you can to enhance LEGO City.</p>",TRUE,4,2,2,3,4
