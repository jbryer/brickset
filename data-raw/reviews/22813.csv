As a bonus it is also not just another Police or Fire based emergency vehicle.</p>
<p>The instructions show you how to build a great looking little one-man Seaplane, using some clever build methods and some pretty decent parts this set's model stands out as a great looking one for a polybag. Much like the City Police Helicopter from this year I found the build to be enjoyable, simple fun. There's no protection for the pilot whatsoever, so in a storm he'll be lashed by rain and the spray of the ocean, but for a Polybag this is an acceptable compromise.</p>
<p>I enjoy the look of the water skis for this plane, the front headlights are a cute little step and the fact that you get a life preserver piece and binoculars to help spot ships or swimmers in distress is a bonus.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is your standard City Coast Guard fare, he's got a double-sided torso print with uniform and badge, he's wearing one of the new lifevests which sadly could use a bit of work (as many AFOLS have noted it doesn't fit very well on Mini-Figure torsos), still he's a great addition to any Mini-Figure collection. The silver shades on his facial print are pretty cool looking.</p>
<p>Overall, for a polybag this is one of the better offerings from LEGO for their City Theme. It isn't as impressive as the Ride-on Lawn Mower, but it's a far cry above the numerous police and fire themed Polybags that LEGO City dishes out practically every other year. The tiny model is perfect for your Coast Guard display. Mind you not everyone is going to like the design, the open cockpit area and the minimalistic approach to the overall build isn't for everybody. Still highly recommended as a stocking stuffer this year, if you can still find it.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-14T20:18:49.123Z","Mini sea plane","<p>Lego set #30225 is a great addition to any Lego City harbour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set includes a mini sea plane, and a coast guard Minifigure.</p>

<p>The Minifigure is nothing exclusive to this set. He has the classic City sunglasses, the standard coast guard torso, a blue hat, and plain blue legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mini sea plane is about five inches long and has a wing span of about the same. It also has room for the Minifigure to sit in it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only functions in this set are spinning propellers, and movable lights.</p>

<p>Overall I think this set is super cool and is a must have for any Lego City collector who would like to keep their harbour safe!</p>
