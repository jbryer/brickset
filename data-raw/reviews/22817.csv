"zipsforbananas","2013-08-06T08:23:10.99Z","Eh? You say you don't like him? You must be 'avin' a giraffe!","<p>What a superb polybag! I think the best thing I can say is that when I put his head on to finish building him I took one look at him and burst out laughing! The comic stylings of the current Geoffrey have been captured wonderfully, he looks delightfully goofy!</p><p>With <b>parts</b>, what you see is very much what you get - lots of yellow and some orange. There aren't all that many interesting pieces, the large round green baseplate is probably the most unusual, after that there are various clip pieces in yellow, and the orange ears might interest some.</p><p>The <b>build</b> is very straightforward, which for a character with such broad appeal is a good thing - even the youngest of giraffe builders shouldn't need much help. Of course the highlight of the set isn't in the parts you get or the technicality of the build, but in the finished model itself. As I mentioned at the start, the one feature of the build, where you build up to the top of the nose and then make the top of the head as another module, saves the moment when you meet Geoffrey right to the end, and putting his eyes on to that goofy mouth is a treat. I imagine the younger the builder the more they will love this 'reveal'.</p><p>The <b>finished model</b> is everything you expect from the pictures, a bright, cheery looking giraffe, poking his head out through green leaves, grinning at you! That he is so obviously made of Lego is part of the charm. And though he only has three moving parts, being able to open and close the mouth and angle the ears opens up a wide range of expressions. I imagine most Geoffreys will end up on display, so the chance to adjust how happy/surprised he looks will make him a fun and charming ""ornament"". And for any builders who want to MOC him a body, bright orange parts might not be so easy to come by, but the simple and very square shape will make it very easy to make a half decent body with very little 'technique', though of course the more skilled MOCer has ample room to amaze too.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Fantastic comic styling</li><li>Simple build makes this an accessible set for any age</li><li>Excellent value - he's free! But even if you pay Â£4.99 for him he's still great value</li><li>Geoff looks hilarious! Stick him somewhere you glance regularly, you'll love him!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Hardly surprising but there's not all that much going on with the parts</li><li>Only being available from Toys R Us is pretty obvious, as he's their mascot, but that might make it hard for some to get hold of him (Yep, I'm scraping the barrel for cons!)</li></ul>
<p>I really love this set! He goes great alongside my growing collection of fun little sets (the squirrel and turtle Friends sets, summer scene and the chicken man!), he's a perfect little trinket. If you can get to a TRU he'll lessen the blow of their inflated prices! Though I went specially and paid just for him, and I'm very glad I did.<br>I own a Lego giraffe! And he looks just like a Lego giraffe should! What's not to love? :D</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2015-10-27T14:30:35.583Z","Do You Wanna be a Toy's-R-Us Kid?","<p><strong>Set #40077 Geoffery: </strong>What better partnership can you have than Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us and LEGO? Well there might be better ones, still when it comes to collecting Polybags sometimes you find a rare gem. Sometimes you find a total dud, which will this mascot promotional set be? Read on and find out.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Unique circular green baseplate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price-Per-Piece count is very solid.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Tons of pieces in a polybag, more than you&rsquo;re used to.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Mostly yellow, orange and some brown pieces.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completed model is superbly executed and features an impressive likeness to the head and neck of a giraffe, loads of pieces interconnected make for an excellent model with fun looking eyes and opening and closing mouth.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Instructions easy to follow and well done.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Promotional item, makes it difficult to track down unless you have some in your local Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us stores still.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Unusual item difficult to place amongst LEGO Collection on the shelf.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Does not include a Mascot Minifigure. Mind you considering the number of pieces in this set this is a minor complaint, but it would have been nice to have a Geoffery Minifigure included with the large giraffe head and neck.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Usefulness of green baseplate questionable.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall, as a free promotional item I strongly recommend this set. As a pay for it later on the secondary market, unless you really want a large number of yellow bricks and pieces, or are a really enthusiastic polybag collector you can safely skip this one. It&rsquo;s really only good as a conversation starter honestly and the model, while impressively designed is missing three fourths of the Giraffe, since there&rsquo;s no body, legs or tail.</p>

<p>If you can still find it at a local TRU you may want to get it just for the novelty, it&rsquo;d look nice next to the exclusive delivery truck from the City Theme, however it&rsquo;s not as much fun as other polybags have been.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-02-28T23:16:36.51Z","This Is Creepy","<p>Well today (28th Feb) Toys R Us has gone into administration in the UK so i thought i&#39;d review one of the many TRU exclusives released during there existence. This set has 90 parts and was a Toys R Us exclusive and was released in 2013 for 5 pounds.</p>

<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>There is only one build and that is Geoffrey&#39;s&nbsp;head which sticks out of a tree. His mouth can open and close and his ears can move up and down to give him different expressions. His neck has some details but nothing to amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>To me the most useful piece in this set is the round 6x6 plate in green which hasn&#39;t been released that often.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is a alright set but i do think it could be better and it does looks a bit creepy, the fact it is only his head is just weird. But for the price i do think its worth it but wouldn&#39;t recommend this set to a LEGO fan but maybe a Toys R Us Fan or LEGO maniac.</p>

<p>R.I.P Toys R Us UK 1984-2018&nbsp;Will be missed in the toy community&nbsp;</p>
