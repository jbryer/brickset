<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>The packaging is a simple polybag with a single sheet of instructions. Nothing to fancy. The packaging also indicates this is a Creator set.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Two hot dog pieces are the highlight of this set, while the minifigure elements are a nice addition. The light blue bike is a delightful addition to my Lego city.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The two figures are similar to the other city figures out right now, and both look excellent. The man's work uniform is a delight, and he also has a double sided head with a scared expression. I wonder what he needs that for...</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build is simple, yet it is fun seeing how simple pieces are used to add some basic play features.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The cart looks wonderful sitting on a street corner with my Modular Buildings. My only complaint is the handle bars are to high for the minifigure to properly grab onto them.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a great set, but is it worth buying $75 dollars of other Lego sets <i>just</i> to get this one? No. Unlike other freebie sets such as Hoth Han Solo or the Minifigure Hulk, there is nothing about this set which will make it a desired collectors item. But that is also part of the charm of this set, it is simple Lego at its finest. If you are planning on buying a lot of Lego sets soon, I would consider buying them now to get this cute set with them. It makes a great addition to any Lego city, and while it might lack the widespread appeal of a limited edition minifigure, it offers more to the display table than a 3 piece standalone figure ever has.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

This set is FREE. And free LEGO is always amazing.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>All the same, there are a few comparisons that can be made with other sets. Among other promotional polybags, the Hot Dog Stand is certainly dynamite - I might be completely wrong here, but I don't think I can even name one that comes with two Minifigs. The set itself is a pretty substantial build, and the inclusion of a rare teal bicycle only sweetens the deal.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Minifigs fall squarely into ""good but not great"" territory. Neither of them is particularly outstanding, but they're sure to find a ready home in one's ever-growing city, so they certainly won't go to waste. I guess the head on the hot dog seller might be new? I don't really recall seeing that goofy little goatee being sported anywhere else.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If one had to make a comparison at all with a retail set, I would have to go with BBQ Stand (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8398-1"">8398</a>), which I am shocked to discover is four frickin' years old already at the time of this review. I have both sets, and even though BBQ Stand is a substantially smaller build than this one, I have to say that there's something about it that leads me to think that it's actually superior to Hot Dog Stand, if only slightly. I suppose that Hot Dog Stand is really about as simple as builds come, which is not necessarily a bad thing since it accomplishes what it sets out to do, but perhaps it could have been even better with just a bit more oomph, no? Regardless, it's nice to have more food services for the city, and I'm going to say over and over again that I really want LEGO to come out with a food truck or something. I'd be all over that.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I was able to snag this guy from my purchase of Tower of Orthanc (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10237-1"">10237</a>), which is a good excuse as any to blow $75 or more on LEGO. I think I'd be remiss if I told anyone to spend a bunch of money just to get this polybag, but, if you already had it in mind to get a bunch of sets for the summer (or winter, for our poor forgotten Australian/South African/etc friends), this freebie is nice icing on the cake.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
