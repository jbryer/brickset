<p>The box doesn&#39;t do a good job of showing it off, and the instructions have the same faults as other instruction books of lego (brick color not showing up right, hard to see some piece additions, etc)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are pretty good, as it&#39;s alot of wall parts, very useful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are no minifigures here that only come with the set, so don&#39;t buy it for minifigures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A quick build, I would not recommend this set if you&#39;re in it just for the building portion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Like most city sets, on its own the model isn&#39;t very enjoyable. However, with a large city of lego (like i own) this set is a great addition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>
