Having achieved this and passed Lego&rsquo;s own internal review process with seemingly few changes (certainly when compared against previous Cuusoo set #21103 Delorean), and with it having been primarily designed by someone who actually worked on the Mars Rover programme, my expectations were high!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same high quality affair as the other recent Cuusoo/Ideas sets &ndash; it opens via a top-lifting flap and contains four unnumbered bags, the instruction booklet and a couple of tan 8x16 plates. The instructions are clear, with the black background contrasting nicely with the primarily white build for the main unit, though it does require a bit of refocusing when it comes to building the mostly black suspension system. This problem is greatly exacerbated in the online instructions, which are very hard to make out in places. The booklet is peppered with interesting facts about the Mars Rover and these snippets give a lovely extra dimension to the build, making sense of the sometimes bizarre looking instruments that are recreated in Lego form.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is nothing particularly remarkable in the selection of parts in the set except perhaps for the two steering arm connector pieces used for the rocker suspension. However, what it lacks in novelty it more than makes up for in sheer variety, with quite a few small pieces for adding detailing, as well as a smattering of Technic elements for the suspension and the front-facing robotic arm.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Following a quick basic build of a small rocky terrain baseplate, construction of the main body of the Rover itself is also fairly simple, but the frequent digressions to add in all the various implements and tools on the rover prevent the build ever getting boring. There are some subtle but effective little tricks that I&rsquo;ve not seen used in official sets before, most notably the upside-down build of the camera and arm, as well the method to create the rocker suspension which allows the rover to keep all wheels on the ground while maintaining stability.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model is everything I had hoped for when I heard it was going to be produced as a set. It looks great and feels solid, whilst being packed with moving parts which can be rotated and bent into a variety of poses.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a shame that the Mars-like red rock formation from the original Cuusoo submission has inexplicably been replaced by grey bricks, but that&rsquo;s a minor point and those who have a burning desire to correct can do so. The base plate makes a handy little stand for the model, which can be posed in an &lsquo;action shot&rsquo; as it makes its way over the terrain.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For a set that could be considered primarily &lsquo;educational&rsquo;, the model still exhibits a fair amount of playability, with potential to explore any surfaces you can find around the house (though if you have highly-strung cats I don&rsquo;t recommend trying to run it over them &ndash; it doesn&rsquo;t end well). It is excellent value for money at RRP, though the set&rsquo;s high after-market price, driven by the very limited time it was available, is more difficult to swallow. Those looking for a complex and involved build may be disappointed, but that&#39;s not what this set is about - it&#39;s&nbsp;a fantastic representation of the Rover,&nbsp;chock-full of nifty little building tricks and looks great when posed over any uneven &lsquo;terrain&rsquo; (except cats).</p>
