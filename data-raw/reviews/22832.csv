<br />
The Clone Trooper Lieutenant minifigure was my first ever clone trooper ever. I obtained it by trading with&nbsp;a classmate last year, for a blue Republic Gunship MOC I was building.<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
The polybag has a nice design, with the green 2013 border and a live-action Yoda jumping out of it, swinging his green lightsaber. The green Star Wars logo evokes much nostalgia. The Lieutenant is displayed on the front, and there are explosions happening around him.<br />
<br />
The material of the polybag also feels very nice, although I can&#39;t really describe it. It feels like a stronger version of plastic packaging common for single-minifigure polybags, instead of the relatively flimsy and common plastic used.</p>

<p><strong>Contents and building process</strong><br />
<br />
Ripping open the seal across the top of, you get the five pieces that make up the Clone Trooper Lieutenant.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was only a matter of seconds before I finished building the minifigure.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
<br />
The <strong>Clone Trooper Lieutenant</strong> is exclusive to this set, although an updated version of him appeared in the 2015 set&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75085-1/Hailfire-Droid"">75085 Hailfire Droid</a>. The only difference between the two versions, is that the 2015 Lieutenant has leg printing.<br />
<br />
Currently, none of the pieces in this set are exclusive. However, before the release of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75085-1/Hailfire-Droid"">2015 Hailfire Droid</a>, the helmet and torso were exclusive pieces.<br />
<br />
The helmet is a realistic Phase 1 helmet with dark azure highlights around the visor.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The torso has&nbsp;realistic Phase 1 armour, with 4 dark azure dots on the right of the breastplate, signifying his rank of Lieutenant in the Grand Army of the Republic. He also has dark azure arms.<br />
<br />
The legs are unprinted, with black hips and white legs, and they look a little plain to me<br />
<br />
It&#39;s worth mentioning that in-universe, at least three different shades of blue are used to represent the Clone Trooper Lieutenant. The main colour used is actually closer to LEGO&#39;s sand blue, but LEGO&#39;s blue has also been used for some iterations of action figures. There are some versions of the character with dark azure though, and I like this colour.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall</strong><br />
<br />
It&#39;s definitely a solid minifigure, but it is unfortunate not really exclusive. It was given away for free though, so you really can&#39;t complain about the price. I guess it&#39;s nice to make this minifigure more common for people who want it, although it seriously devalues this set as a result.<br />
<br />
The Clone Trooper Lieutenant&nbsp;makes a nice ranked clone in your Grand Army, plus he&nbsp;doesn&#39;t double as a pilot, so there&#39;s that.<br />
<br />
If you want the minifigure and have the money to spare, I&#39;d recommend getting <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75085-1/Hailfire-Droid"">75085&nbsp;Hailfire Droid</a> instead. The version of the Lieutenant that appears there is arguably superior, with added leg printing.<br />
<br />
I hope you found this review helpful and informative.</p>
