<p>What does that mean for the model in this Polybag? It's a bit of a throwaway one to be honest. Admittedly the large Kraang flick-firing missile weapon looks like a nifty little display piece for a Kraang Lab build, unfortunately the other element of the set. (A small table with four fake turtles made out of a grouping of 1x1 pieces) can be a bit dodgy.</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure also does not include any accessories, basically he doesn't come with the gun the one in the Shellraiser set does, his large missile firing cannon is meant to be his weapon, so that is a bit of a dissapointment. It's a great looking Mini-Figure though, with double-sided torso printing showing the Kraang brain from the front and back of the android body's stomach cavity, the harness used to hold it in, leg printing showing off servos and electronic bits and a double-sided head print. (Not face, just head.) The alien android's face is on one side and the back of the mechanical monstrosity is on the other.</p>
<p>All done in the unique light blue torso coloring with rare gray colored Mini-Figure head and hands. A very beautifully designed Mini-Figure for collectors.</p>
<p>Overall, while the model is happily recycled into spare parts (including some nice rose colored bits, there are actually two rose colored cones not just one like the instructions say) this set is more for collectors and army builders than it is for play. And the four small turtle dummies are also considerably easy to lose, since they are loose sitting on the table to be knocked down by the flick-fire missile. Still highly recommend this for fans of Polybags, Mini-Figs and TMNT. It's also a great stocking stuffer, so stock up before TRU sells them all out.</p>",TRUE,3,2,2,2,4
