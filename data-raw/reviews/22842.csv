<p>It came in a simple polybag, with instructions on a&nbsp;small&nbsp;sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has great parts! The brain is really cool, and is great for kaiju. The pieces that make up the sword are nice for MOCs, mainly the large red blade and hilt.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really simple, all you do is stick the 3-axle into the connector, plug the red blade into that, put a 2-axle into a fire piece and assemble it all.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A sword and a Brain.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good set if you&#39;re a sci-fi fan, as the black Brain can be used for a lot of stuff. I would recommend it if you&#39;re a BIONICLE/CCBS builder.</p>
