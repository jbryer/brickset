<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Box is really having a&nbsp;nice design, quite appealing for architects and fan of LEGO. You do not have formal instruction, but more some advises how to build your own creations. Book covers all aspects of being a creative architect as e.g. Space, shapes, etc... It contains quite relevant inputs from architects and inspires one to be creative.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are interesting, but to this price tag I would have expected more parts and with rare ones too, which seems not being the case. It is a bit a disappointment, not have other shapes to make interesting buildings.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigures include to this serious set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is up to you own creativity.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Not applicable</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set for beginning architects and advanced builders.&nbsp;</p>
