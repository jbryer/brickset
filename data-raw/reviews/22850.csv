While probably not enough on its own to transform you overnight into a LEGO employee, there are tips and advice on every page to help spark creative ideas and fuel story&nbsp;building. These details are really interesting, especially to someone like me who is better at strictly following instructions than building freeform. It made me really want to see what I could come up with, and I&#39;d love to get the other sets in the series as well.</p>

<p>The set includes three sets packaged together, and&nbsp;comes with three versions of the same minifigure. Each one is equipped for a different part of the adventure. They&#39;re all pretty cool, showing different abilities, from flying to cooling down lava, of the adventurer. Technically, only one can really be played with at once, since they are the same character, but it&#39;s nice to have them all.</p>

<p>The three different sections can all be connected together to form a continuous model. They fit together really well, both in construction and in design. There are also some cool features, with hidden objects, a trapdoor, and a pop-off section. Overall, a really cool set with a lot of potential.</p>
