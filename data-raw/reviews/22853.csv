<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Packaged in a small bag, like all PF products.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This has the RPM of an M-motor and&nbsp;half the torque of a XL-motor. This gives you far more flexibility than a XL-motor, because you can adjust the speed using gears (XL-motors have 220 RPM, M and L motors have 380 RPM). &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Motor is also *almost* the same size as a M-motor (L is 7 studs long, M is 6), but is FAR easier to fit into a technic MOC, because it has way more connection points.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only thing I don&#39;t like about this Motor is that it&#39;s almost twice the price of an M-motor, at $13.99.&nbsp;</p>

"Sarang","2017-02-14T07:18:13.017Z","Great Motor for Technic builders","<p>The L-motor occupies a position between the M and the XL motors due to its overall specifications and is preferred over the smaller m-motor by Technic builders.</p>

<p><strong>Size</strong></p>

<p>It is a single stud longer than the m-motor but has &#39;extensions&#39; on the top and bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Attachment</strong></p>

<p>It has more attachment points than the m motor but lacks any system connections. This makes it easier to integrate into Technic builds than the m-motor.</p>

<p><strong>Specifications&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The m-motor has a higher RPM than the l-motor making it a bit slower. But when it comes to torque the l-motor is better than the m-motor.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>The L-motor is ideally placed when it comes to specs but it&#39;s price a sticking point for some people.</p>
