Later, I started using&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Power-Functions"">9 volt Power Function</a>&nbsp;(PF) motors starting with an&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8883-1/M-Motor"">M Motor</a> in my <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8292-1/Cherry-Picker"">Cherry Picker (8292)</a>&nbsp;set and then an <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/88003-1/L-Motor"">L Motor</a>&nbsp;in my&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42009-1/Mobile-Crane-MK-II"">Mobile Crane&nbsp;Mk II (42009)</a>.</p>

<p>All of these motors were limited to full&nbsp;forward, reverse and off options. When I purchased <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60052-1/Cargo-Train"">Cargo Train</a>, I experimented with&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8884-1/IR-Receiver"">IR Receiver</a>&nbsp;connected to these PF motors and discovered that if it is placed between any PF&nbsp;9 volt battery box and any PF&nbsp;motor, you get much finer control of the motor.</p>

<p>An <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8879-1/IR-Speed-Remote-Control"">IR Speed Remote Control</a>&nbsp;gives all PF motors incremental speed control with seven forward,&nbsp;seven reverse and off settings. This remote control is usually found in train sets and is normally used to finely control the speed of trains however it will remotely control all PF Motors provided an IR Receiver is connected.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8885-1/IR-Remote-Control"">IR Remote Control</a> that has been included in Technic sets such as <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8275-1/Motorized-Bulldozer"">Motorized Bulldozer (8275)</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42030-1/Volvo-L350F-Wheel-Loader"">Volvo L350F Wheel Loader&nbsp;(42030)</a>&nbsp;does not have this fine incremental capability.</p>

<p>Since nearly all my Technic sets are motorised, I looked into adding steering capability to my sets particularly my <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8448-1/Super-Street-Sensation"">Super Street Sensation (8448)</a>. I had recently added an M Motor to this set.</p>

<p>I was interested adding a <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/88004-1/Servo-Motor"">Servo Motor</a>&nbsp;which could be remotely controlled so that I had both speed and steering functions.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>In researching&nbsp;Power Functions, I reached an <a href=""http://shop.lego.com/en-NZ/Power-Functions-Servo-Motor-88004?fromListing=listing"">excellent review</a> of PF motors on LEGO Online Shop written by <a href=""http://reviews.lego.com/profiles/1360/52042308/profile.htm"">mbellis</a>.</p>

<p>The servo motor rotates 90&deg; left or right,&nbsp;180&deg; in total.</p>

<p>When connected to an IR Remote Control, the Servo Motor is limited to full left, full right or centred.</p>

<p>When connected to an IR Speed Remote Control the Servo Motor has seven&nbsp;steps to the left and seven steps to the right (still limited to&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16.3636360168457px;"">90&deg;)</span>. The red button will quickly centre to Servo Motor and the steering.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The PF motors are very compact when compared to earlier <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16.3636360168457px;"">Technic&nbsp;</span>motors. Despite my Super Street Sensation car being 15 years old, it has been remarkably easy to install the M Motor, Servo Motor, IR Receiver and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8881-1/Battery-Box"">9 volt battery pack</a>.</p>

<p>This car can be built as either a&nbsp;convertible&nbsp;(as shown in these images) or with gull wing doors. The motors&nbsp;are configured the same way but the battery box is located differently&nbsp;for each mode; tucked behind the seats for the convertible&nbsp;or in the boot of the gull winged door mode. My full review the Super Street Sensation&nbsp;can be read at <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/author-flagsnz"">my review&nbsp;page</a>.</p>

<p>This image shows the battery pack and IR Receiver.</p>

<p>This image shows the M Motor installed on the left of the chassis (between the gear box and differential) and the Servo Motor on the right.</p>

<p>This image shows the Servo Motor, rack and pinion. The modular V8 engine is removed for clarity.</p>

<p>Because the IR Receiver handles two channels, one channel is set for the M Motor while the other is allocated to the Servo Motor. One IR Speed Remote Control handles both speed and steering.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>All the PF motors are designed to be easily&nbsp;attached to any Technic set. This review has shown&nbsp;that this equally applies to classic sets as well as current models. Fitting these two motors was achieved with minimal modification.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>To enable the&nbsp;Servo Motor to function remotely, you will need an IR Receiver and either an IR Remote Control or an IR Speed Remote Control.</p>

<p>An&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16.3636360168457px;"">IR Speed Remote Control will give you more control options.</span></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Adding remote controlled&nbsp;PF motors to this set has substantially increased the playability.</p>

<p>The motivation has been to have this car ready for&nbsp;display at the <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/12658/the-2014-auckland-brick-show-25-27-october"">Auckland Brick Show</a> but I Know there will be ongoing fun driving this bright red remotely controlled LEGO sports car around.</p>

<p>If you are a LEGO Technic enthusiast&nbsp;and may be looking at adding some remote PFs to your models, have a look at incorporating&nbsp;an IR Receiver, IR Speed Remote Control and a Servo Motor to your sets. You will have a lot of fun.</p>
