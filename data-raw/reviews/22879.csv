"FlagsNZ","2014-05-04T08:25:41.28Z","Denmark's two iconic companies: Maersk Line and Lego","<p>Lego have produced a fantastic model of the other Danish&nbsp;global phenomenon, The Maersk Line Triple E container ship.</p>

<p>Having served at sea for over 20 years in container ships, with two tours being in Maersk&nbsp;feeder ships running into Hong Kong and Singapore, it was only natural that I would acquire&nbsp;this latest Lego model.</p>

<p>It is only through working in these large international container ports that you get a feel for how large this shipping company really is with several Maersk mother ships arriving daily into port on their continuous eastward round the world voyages. Through globalization, 90% of everything you own is delivered&nbsp;to your country in container ships like these.</p>

<p>Discovery Channel had an episode showing the construction of <em>Eugene Maersk&nbsp;</em>and likened the construction of this ship to building a Lego model with ship parts being made all over Europe. Here is &nbsp;a reverse example with a Lego model of the construction of a similar somewhat larger ship.</p>

<p>Initially I wanted to get this model and display it like more static ship models. But I have discovered there is more you can do with it.</p>

<p>I had to wait as Lego sold out when the set was first released and I was fortunate to get a model on back order.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>If you look on the end of the box, you will see a photo of the real thing. The Triple E Class ship has 24 bays of 40 foot containers arranged with 9 in front of the accommodation, 10 between the accommodation&nbsp;and engine room, with 5 at the aft end. In the Lego model this is scaled down to 5, 5 and 3 bays of 4x2 stud bricks, 13 bays of bricks in total. So the Lego <em>container</em> bricks are about twice as long as the real thing. The containers would be more in proportion if the 40 foot <em>containers&nbsp;</em>were 4x1&nbsp;bricks, with 20 foot containers being 2x1 bricks.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Parts</span></h3>

<p>There are some new parts in this model, but the two orange life boats stand out. They look more like inflatable rescue boats rather than the enclosed life boats they represent.</p>

<p>Lego have used the mini-figure ice skates as two radar scanners. These can be constructed so that the scanners are at slightly different heights which is how they would be in the real ship so when they are both transmitting they do not interfere&nbsp;with each other.</p>

<p>What has not been mentioned in other reviews is the crew swimming pool which is the 1x1 blue tile down next to the starboard life boat.</p>

<p>The two MAK engines are really great and I like the two windlasses&nbsp;on the forecastle.</p>

<h3>The building experience</h3>

<p>It took about two hours to build the ship and about one hour applying the stickers. Some of the stickers stretch across several bricks, but as I do not intend to dismantle the model this is OK.</p>

<p>I hope the stickers do not peel off with age.</p>

<p>Lego could have printed Maersk onto the bricks however the uppermost containers are a sandwich&nbsp;of two 4x2 plates and a tile which would have made printing impossible.</p>

<h3>The completed model&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The completed model looks fantastic.</p>

<p>I have taken this model into work where I teach maritime studies and used it as a prop in the classroom.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5508/14479950877_a92ecbb478.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I can see this as a useful tool while teaching ship construction, ship stability, COLREGS and many more maritime subjects. I have managed to bring out other TFOL and AFOL&nbsp;from the students.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am impressed with this building experience.</p>

<p>I will be building a set of container bays using random colours&nbsp;similar to that shown in the photo on the box so that the model has a more real world look and not the <em>display case</em> image with all the Maersk&nbsp;containers. I will also use 1x4&nbsp;bricks and 2x1&nbsp;bricks to represent 40 and 20 foot containers.</p>

"Monkeyman3838","2015-01-03T15:41:48.653Z","Great Set, lots of stickers....","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It comes in a HUGE box that contains a package with a cardboard slip, 2 instruction manuals, and stickers. The stickers are the hardest thing about this set because you have to keep placing them and placing them.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set probably has some of the GREATEST parts ever made!!!!!!!!!!! They included 3 ice skates, (1 extra), 3 blue slanted pieces on the front from the old space themes, I think. The set also comes with lots of blue, red and some green for the engines.&nbsp;Some gate pieces as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>NO MINIFIGURES.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about an hour and a half to 2 hours. I would have been done sooner had it not been for the stickers! :)</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall, great model, with some nice touches like the lucky coin underneath the white thing at the front.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>AWESOME JOB LEGO!!!!!!!!! Just include some minifigures.</p>

The many stickers that overlap bricks when applied makes it near impossible to dismantle without causing damage. For that reason I choose to build it without the stickers, so does look somewhat incomplete.</p>

<p>The build itself seemed much easier than any of the other &quot;Expert&quot; sets that I have built, and took only&nbsp;about 2 hours to complete. I also thought the&nbsp;detailing could have been a bit better, aside from the dual engines down below, rear props,and the two&nbsp;small rescue boats, there really wasn&#39;t a whole lot of detail.</p>

<p>My thanks to&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/profile/flagsnz"" rel=""author"">FlagsNZ</a>&nbsp;for their review (May 2014) and posting of pictures of a model that has substituted&nbsp;multi-colored&nbsp;cargo container bricks&nbsp;for some of the gray ones. Very cool idea for members that don&#39;t like a lot of stickers.&nbsp;</p>
