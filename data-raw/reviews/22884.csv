Today we will be looking at my personal favourite the Abominable Snowman or as the Tibetans call them (yes, them!) the Yeti. A snow creature who lives in the Himalayas. This is actually a very good set for a minifigure.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The packet is, as is most minifigure packets is very boring. On the front it has a picture of the Scientist, Evil Mech, Island Warrior, Lady Robot, Constable, Gingerbread Man, Barbarian, Yeti and the Mountain Climber all packed together and on the back it has the boring stuff, choking hazards blah blah, made in China blah blah. The instructions are also like all other minifigure's instructions have a list of&nbsp; the figures and on the back where all the pieces go.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>For a minifigure you don't get many parts but for me, the piece that really standed out for me was not the Yeti head but the ice lolly!<br></p>
<h4>Minifigure</h4><p>The Yeti is made out of totally unique pieces and that, for me anyway is a great thing. The legs are white with light blue 'furry' line on them and light blue feet (according to some reports, the Yeti's feet are actually MUCH larger then a humans). The torso is also white with light blue line around him and a fat tummy with a belly button in the middle and it also has light blue hands. The head or 'sandwich board' as it is known by some has that busy look on white fur and eyebrows with a light blue face with large tusks (Yeti's do not actually have any tusks from what I have read). The accessories are the trans-blue ice lolly which for me is a great thing for the set (but really, who has ever heard of a Yeti licking a ice lolly?) and your regular black minifigure stand.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4>Your joking, right?
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The yeti is a great thing to have a mountain or snow-y MOC and if you are cryptozooolgist and love Lego then this is a great set.&nbsp; <br></p><b>Summery </b><br><br>Altogether, this is one of the best minifigures in Lego cryptozooolgy history.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,3,1,5,5

<p>The Yeti is a great looking Mini-Figure, all white of course, the torso is a single-sided furry print with more furry patterns on the upper legs and around the feet his toes can be seen. Not as fully detailed as a Chima Mini-Fig, but still looking perfect and featuring a brand new head piece, much like a Star Wars Alien character it's a big unique piece that covers some of the chest detail with a long bit of extra fur.</p>
<p>He has a blue skinned face with two tough looking fangs protruding from his bottom lip, although it's hard to tell the upper and lower mouth apart since the line for the upper lip is tricky to make out. He also has the same colored blue for his hands, which is a new rare Mini-Figure hand color introduced with this series. He's a friendly character though as he comes with a transparent dark blue popsicle accessory, a nice piece that isn't easy to come by in any color.</p>
<p>Overall, I recommend tracking him down, he isn't that too difficult to find being six per case, and he looks like he'd fit in quite nicely next to the Mini-Figures in costumes, or Mythological Mini-Figures, whichever you'd choose to display him with in a group.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3

All three are fantastic, but the most interesting concept amongst them has to be the Yeti. This abominable character was released way back in 2013, where it retailed for, surprisingly, $2.99. It only includes 5 pieces, which is less than the typical piece count for CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>On top is not only the most interesting piece, but also the most detailed! It was made exclusively for this figure, which is obviously, super appreciated. It&#39;s caste entirely in white, and gosh, is it detailed! The intricate fur moulding around the mouth, sides of the head, back of the head, and the top is insanely well-done, and this minifigure undeniably holds up to today&#39;s CMFs. The light blue printing on the face, as well as the light tan tusks are&nbsp;so fantastic, as are the black eyes. I adore the head piece, and it may be my favourite piece in the series.</p>

<p>But of course, the rest of the figure looks great as well, including the torso, a piece that not only has detail with the head piece attached, but has more detail underneath! Fur is surrounding his chest, and a furry belly button is printed on the bottom. He doesn&#39;t have any back printing, but I honestly don&#39;t care, because the head piece is detailed enough for me.</p>

<p>The legs are, again, remarkably detailed. More fur is scattered around the thighs, and there are even some big feet! He does not have side leg printing, which would have been great, but oh well.</p>

<p>Part of the figure which gets nearly as much love as the head piece is that popsicle, which is a pretty intuitive inclusion, as it gives the Yeti a much more lovable vibe. It&#39;s caste in a fantastic trans-light blue tone, which is definitely not a colour we see too often. It&#39;s an accessory that shouldn&#39;t fit, but really does.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure, and overall, I am a sucker for Christmas/winter themed Minifigures, so of course I&nbsp;love this character! Not only is it an incredibly fresh and innovative concept, but it&#39;s executed masterfully, with some absolutely incredible detailing in the moulding, and the prints. This is another easy 5 out of 5 figure for me, and I know I have said this with nearly every Series 11 figure so far, but this is definitely one of my favorites in the series.</p>
