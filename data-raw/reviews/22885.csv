"Pawel_Kaminski_HWS","2013-08-26T08:44:37.603Z","Another exellent tribute minifigure!","<p>This is an alternative/evil version of the previous white Battle Mech minifigure from minfigures series 9, that resembled a little to Mars Mission and mostly to Galaxy Squad space sub-theme. Obviously the evil version is better. I will explain why. The Evil Mech is a third new minifigure that resembles to the old Blacktron space sub-theme from the 80's and 90's (I and II). This is the second Blacktron minifigure in the Collectable Minifigures theme (Space Villian in series 3). The first of all tribute minifigures was Rench from Space Police III sub-theme (set 5981).&nbsp;</p><p>On the printings you can find some fun details like: Blacktron I logo on the armour piece, Yellow triangle on the torso that reminds of Iron Man's generator which connects with Blacktron I logo, Torso printing that is very similar to the Blacktron I uniform design, Cross-Hair printed on the head just like the blue UFO droid from 1997 has, Lime green details on arms and legs that fits with head colour and Blacktron II.</p><p>Minifigure contains a megaphone gun with 1x1 trans neon-green cone piece, just like in the 90's Space and Star Wars sets. It also comes with black 3x4 modified tile (just like all collectable minifigures) as a minifigure stand.</p><p>The previous version of the Mech was more Japanese like. Evil Mech looks just so badass in his new colour scheme that totally deserves to be a part of my LEGO Space collection.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li></li><li>Badass looking minifigure</li><li>Armour piece</li><li>Connects with both Blacktron sub-themes as BTIII / NBT / Tribute minifigure</li><li>90's style legs and robot head that also resembles to the classic skeleton skull</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Chinese plastic...</li></ul>
<p>I you're an AFOL that loves Blacktron, this is a must have!</p><p><br></p><p>-Pawel Kaminski HWS (aka pkmovies92)</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,4,5

Or Evil = Black","<p><strong>Set #71002 Evil Mech: </strong>Re-using the Battle Mech accessories and parts was inevitable, expect to see a Female Mech in the future from LEGO's CMF offerings, I know I do. However these are some great parts to see again.</p>
<p>The Evil Mech is all black, whereas the Battle Mech was pretty much all white, it's Black vs. White, Evil vs. Good, your standard stereotype really. For once it'd be kind of nice to see something different, anyway let's dicuss the Mini-Fig. This one is truly impressive there's a really detailed torso print with some nice cog and mechanical workings visible. It is not a double-sided torso, however it does include the rare side-arm printing which is nice to see. He also has some nice leg printing similar to the Battle Mech.</p>
<p>Accessorywise aside from the new helmet and armor piece seen with the Battle Mech, this Mini-Figure also carries a Classic Space era blaster with transparent green tube. The chest armor has a bit of nice printing, and again a hint at perhaps someone in LEGO's CMF team really interested in Legend of Zelda sets, because on his armor is an upside down Triforce design. The helmet also has some nice print detail too. His head is a rare green color and features a similar face print to the Battle Mech.</p>
<p>Overall, while this Mini-Figure is a bit of a repeat considering we only just got the Battle Mech recently, it's a nice re-use of parts and definitely easy to find. I'd say he's one you can't skip, the detail work alone is great and the fact that he has side-arm printing makes him a nifty Mini-Fig to add to your collection.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3
"sideswinger","2022-09-13T23:42:50.203Z","another MECH?","<p>Number four in LEGO Minifigures Series 11 is the Evil Mech. This minifigure was released way back in 2013, where it retailed for $2.99 in US dollars, and includes 8 pieces. The robot trope in CMF&#39;s, while much worse now than ever before, is an idea that has been used to death, even in 2013, so let&#39;s see what sets this figure apart from the rest.</p>

<p>First off, that helmet piece is a recolour of the Series 9 Battle Mech&#39;s helmet, and it&#39;s caste in black, which has great silver printing on the head crest&nbsp;and mouth plate. Keep in mind, this entire figure is based off the Series 9 Battle Mech, so you&#39;re gonna see some overlap.</p>

<p>The head print underneath is surprisingly fleshed out. It has that small target icon in the centre, and some alien technology etched around the sides. There&#39;s no printing behind the head, but the fact that there&#39;s extra detail on the head at all is good enough for me.</p>

<p>Okay, so the breastplate piece is, yet again, a recolour of the Battle Mech&#39;s armour, only now it&#39;s caste in black. I definitely appreciate the silver vents at the front, but the yellow Blacktron logo is such an excellent touch. Now, like the Battle Mech,&nbsp;there are two poles at the back that aren&#39;t used for anything, but it resembles some sort of jetpack.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the torso underneath has some incredibly impressive printing, which is odd, considering it isn&#39;t seen without removing the armour. Legit, the torso underneath may have the most complex printing of the series! I adore all the mechanical features, as well as the arc-reactor like print at the top. He doesn&#39;t have back printing, but what he does have is even better: side arm printing. I love when LEGO adds unnecessary but great touches, and we definitely see that here on the arms.</p>

<p>Finishing the base figure itself is the legs, which have some more really awesome printing. I love the small green line on the waist, and between the dark grey knees&nbsp;and green thighs, I definitely approve of the leg printing.</p>

<p>Of course all good things must come to an end. While I&#39;m happy he has one at all, his accessory is super lame. It&#39;s just a black speaker phone piece that has no relevance to the figure at all, and I can think of many other accessories LEGO could&#39;ve included that would&#39;ve made a bigger impact for the figure. It has a 1x1 trans-green cone attached to the tip, but nothing about that accessory is all too interesting.</p>

<p>That is it for the figure! Overall, as you saw whilst clicking on this review, I&#39;ve only given this figure a 3 out of 5. I&#39;ve gushed about how detailed and well done the prints are this entire review, and I loved the original Series 9 Battle Mech. So why did I give this a low rating? Well, that&#39;s just the reason why: I loved the original Series 9 figure, therefore an exact remake with different colours definitely isn&#39;t a fresh concept, or something I wanted or needed. That being said, this has phenomenal detailing, which is ultimately why this scored a 3 and not lower.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review! Thank you for reading!</p>
