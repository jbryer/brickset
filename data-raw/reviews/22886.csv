<p>The Welder introduces us to a few new parts, the helmet for one is very detailed and has a lot of great sculpt work put into it in order to achieve the proper authentic look. It's a single piece though, it might have been interesting to see this piece done similar to Iron Man's helmet, so you could flip up the visor to see the face underneath while still wearing the helmet. However it isn't a deal breaker.</p>
<p>There's also a nice new rubberized piece that acts as the welding tool's device... I have no idea what it's called honestly, the part where the flame pops out and the grip/hose/adjustable control nozzle combination thing that attaches to the tube. Which has a small flammable sign printed on it, and is in orange.</p>
<p>Print wise he has a double-sided torso with thick coveralls protecting a grimy looking undershirt and a single-sided face with stubble, splotches of oil or grease and a neutral face expression. No leg printing unfortunately if you prefer that sort of thing.</p>
<p>Overall I think this is one of the stand outs from the Series and I'm glad LEGO put six in a case to make it easier to get doubles of for a LEGO City workforce. Recommend this Mini-Fig wholeheartedly.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,3,3

The Series 11 Welder falls in the latter cetergory, considering it had 6 per box back in the day. I&#39;ve always loved this figure, since my own father welds frequently, therefore I know a bit about the occupation.</p>

<p>The mask, which is caste in what appears to be gun-metal grey if I&#39;m not mistaking, was new for the figure. I like the shaded printing on the faceplate, and overall, the inclusion of that new piece is super appreciated.</p>

<p>The head print underneath is definitely expressive, with a frustrated frown. I love the stubble around his mouth, and the two scars on his face are excellent touches. This is one of my favourite head prints of the series!</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing overly special happening at the torso; merely some blue overalls that contrast on light grey. It fits the figure, however, and I do like the small tear. It&#39;s carried onto the back, and back torso printing is definitely appreciated here.</p>

<p>Since the legs have no printing, we must move on to the accessory, which is made of two pieces. The orange cylinder on bottom has that fantastic print, which is only present on one side. The best part of the figure for me has to be the welding tool piece itself, which was extremely new for the figure. It looks absolutely brilliant! It&#39;s caste in a soft rubber, and it&#39;s super detailed, from the tip at the top, to the rounded perimeter at the bottom, which attaches to the 1x1.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the figure, and I used to sort of dislike this character. But, in retrospect, this is an incredible CMF, not only for its excellent concept, but for its introduction of two brand-new pieces, which is super impressive! At the end of the day, this gets a 4 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading, and have a nice day!</p>
