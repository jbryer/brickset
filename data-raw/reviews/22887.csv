Sometimes it's pretty useful, but now it isn't. I'm not so happy about her...<br></p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>At least, she's very detailed. Many machinery, buttons, levers are on her torso.<br></li><li>The blocky head is nice, even if it has purple eyes and red mouth.</li><li>I think the pink hands are unique. But surely rare.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The figure is nonsense. It's just the girl version of the clockwork robot.<br></li><li>No accessories, except the black plate.</li><li>Her eyes, mouth and ""belt"" with hearts look strange.<br></li></ul>
<p>All in all, I think this minifig doesn't make any sense. All of the Series 11 minifigs are so cool, except that. Well, it's funny that the clockwork robot falls in love with the lady robot, but I think it wasn't a good idea to make this strange-looking female robot. And robots don't have gender at all!&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English grammar! :D<br></p>",TRUE,2,2,3,2,2

<p>The Lady Robot is very similar to the Clockwork Robot from Series 6, she pretty much is the exact same color of grey, all the parts are shared between the two and there's really nothing new added to the party. Her printing however is much different, only a single sided torso print though which makes sense as the key and bracket would cover up the print anyway.</p>
<p>Overall she's a decent chance at getting the unique head piece if you missed out on the Clockwork Robot, I just wish it hadn't taken up the slot of another Female Mini-Figure. You also get some rare pink hands, not sure what you could use them for, but that is a plus. Unless you're going for the entire set though you can safely skip her.</p>",TRUE,2,1,1,2,2
"sideswinger","2022-09-24T21:40:06.043Z","detailed, but BAD!","<p>The Series 6 Clockwork Robot has to be my favourite robot CMF ever. Therefore an exact gender swap should be great as well, right? The Lady Robot is just that: a gender swap. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s bad, per se, but I do think her concept is relatively weak.</p>

<p>On top, we have that head piece that was first introduced with that original Clockwork Robot. Of course the printing here is new and exclusive, and the rosy cheeks and lips are adorable, as are her purple eyes.</p>

<p>Wrapped around her neck is that bracket part that is used to attach the wind-up. It&#39;s a great piece, but it wasn&#39;t new for her or anything.</p>

<p>Her torso is extremely detailed, which I definitely appreciate. I think it may even be more detailed than the original Clockwork Robot, which is very welcome. She has many dials and vents, and all the colours work very nicely. I love her pink hands, but, even though it&#39;d be covered anyway, back torso printing is not incorporated.</p>

<p>Her legs do lack side printing, which look&nbsp;a bit awkward, but the front printing is brilliant. I dig the pink, pointy stripes, as well as the silver on the knees and feet.</p>

<p>And since she has no accessory, that&#39;s it for the figure. Overall, her detail in incredible, and she may even be more detailed than the original Series 6 Clockwork Robot. But the sad truth is, she&#39;s a really bad concept. If they don&#39;t bring anything new to the trope, gender swaps are useless, and I feel this figure suffers from that. At the end of the day, she&#39;s detailed enough to earn a 3 out of 5, but her concept is so bad that I won&#39;t give her anything more.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
