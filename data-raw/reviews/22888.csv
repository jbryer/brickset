<p>Comparing this Mini-Figure to certain familiar pop culture icons makes sense, he's dressed in an all black suit with a single sided torso print showing off a black tie and white shirt, his facial print has some wicked looking sideburns and a pair of spiffy shades with a solemn looking expression and he's wearing the Gangster's hat. Yep Elwood and Jake are honored to have a Mini-Figure based on them. (Kind of hope LEGO introduces a new Harmonica piece some time in the future.)</p>
<p>Accessory-wise his Saxaphone is almost perfect, the way it's held makes it a bit tricky for him to hold the mouthpiece up to his mouth for jamming sessions, other than that small nitpick the sculpt work is pure love. And it adds a much needed musical instrument piece to the LEGO Music Instruments already out there.</p>
<p>Overall you definitely want to pick this one up, being only two for a case he's really tough to track down as everyone wants one, or two. He was the last one I managed to snag to complete my set of 16 from this Series, and I still haven't tried to find another one to own two of them, definitely recommend picking up this one folks, he's much appreciated from this series.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3

<p>As a sax player myself, this guy stood out to me.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he&#39;s going for $15 or so now on the auction site, so he&#39;s not easy to get compared to what he retailed for in stores.&nbsp; It seems the market agrees with me on this guy retaining value.</p>

But the most detailed instrument piece of all may be the one which released in 2013, with the Series 11 Saxophone Player. The name is self-explanatory, but what else is special about the figure? It retailed for only $2.99 back in the day, and included 6 pieces, all of which I&#39;ll break down!</p>

<p>On top is a black cowboy hat. Of course, it isn&#39;t meant to represent a cowboy here, but that&#39;s typically what that piece was used for back in the day. I personally think it looks incredible on this figure, because boy, does it give the figure a wild aesthetic!</p>

<p>The head print adds to the vibe! His classy black sunglasses look sporty, as does his serious frown. The side-burns are more than likely meant to represent some sort of blues singer, but since I know jack-crap about the music industry, I won&#39;t assume.</p>

<p>Hie torso is surprisingly plain and boring, while also very fitting. The white undershirt contrasts against the black jacket nicely. No back torso printing is implemented, which is super weak, since the figure itself already lacks detail.</p>

<p>Since he has no printing on his legs, we must move on to the most interesting part of the figure, as well as his name-sake: the saxophone. And my gosh, it totally makes up for the otherwise plain figure. It might be the most detailed piece in the series, and it looks absolutely phenomenal! Not only does it curve into a perfect crater at the bottom, but the buttons along the neck are gorgeous. It curves into a tip, where air is blown into the instrument, and some black printing encourages it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the figure, and overall, the minifigure itself, while it fits the saxophone-player vibe, is relatively uninteresting. But of course, the main aspect of the figure is his sax, and yes, it&#39;s stunning; but this LEGO line is titled &quot;minifigures,&quot; not &quot;accessories.&quot; With that being said, I&#39;m still giving this a 4 out of 5, because I can get over the non-detailed, but fitting minifigure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review! Thanks for reading, and if you&#39;re a saxophone player, you have my respect!</p>
