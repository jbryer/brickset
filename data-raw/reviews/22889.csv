<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Suitable for an Victorian MOC</li><li>Accurate helmet, similar to the ones seen today, so you might be able to reuse it in a modern setting</li><li>Looks like a ""definitive"" Policeman, even down to the bushy, Dick Strawbridge-style&nbsp;moustache</li><li>Helmet strap printing on head</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Unusual Markings/numbers - The ""JCF"" only police reference I can muster is the Jamaican Constabulary Force, which wouldn't fit. The ""1337"" number is an obscure reference to a connecting lead set for the Technic theme</li><li>Little in the way of printing - the torso (front), head and helmet (silver paint)&nbsp;are the only things that are printed</li></ul><p>To sum up, it's very minimalist, but one of the cleanest and best figs so far. I would've preferred some back printing (even if it's only a few creases) and a notebook/pencil item might've been a bit more appropriate than a baton.<br></p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2013-10-23T20:07:04.42Z","Carry On Constable","<p><strong>Set #71002 Constable: </strong>Here he is, the last Mini-Fig from Series 11 to review and he is super awesome.</p>
<p>The Constable represents British police officers, I want to say of the past, however they may still dress in this style of uniform. Though I highly doubt it. Still this Mini-Figure looks very impressive, his body is all black with a single-sided torso print showing off his precinct number on his collar (1337) and a small&nbsp;medal/badge with JCF on it... Not sure if that's initials for his name or his rank.</p>
<p>He has a serious looking facial expression with a nice handlebar mustache and the strap for his new hat piece printed on as well, similar to the Royal Guard. His accessory is suitably impressive, a billy club is what they're called, and they're for... Well subduing criminals. Both accessories make finding him a breeze, it doesn't hurt that he's also 6 per case.</p>
<p>Overall this Mini-Fig just warms the old school film buff in me, not only does he look like a Keystone Cop, but some of the best British comedy films are the Carry On series and you can't go wrong when your LEGO Constable decides to Carry On. I strongly recommend tracking a few of him down to populate your LEGO City, especially if you're a fan of classic films.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,3,4
"sideswinger","2022-09-22T18:23:31.23Z","FITTING!","<p>At the time of writing this, Queen Elizabeth II has sadly passed away. It&#39;s unfortunate we never got a minifigure directly based off her. However, a few other Royal themed CMF&#39;s have been produced, and coincidentally, one of them is next in my quest to review every LEGO CMF (that accidentally rhymed!). This Constable character was released back in 2013 in Series 11, where it retailed for only $2.99. It includes 6 pieces, which was normal back then.</p>

<p>The hat this adjourns was made exclusively for this figure. It may look like an old LEGO Explorers hat, but trust me, it was one of the many new pieces made for the series. The printing is good; not only is there a small pendant in front, but there&#39;s a tad bit of silver at the tip of the hat.</p>

<p>This figure&#39;s head print is brilliant. Not only does he have that big, bushy, brown moustache, but he also has a black strap that carries down from the top. It makes the figure feel very cohesive.</p>

<p>The torso has similar detail to the hat. It shares the silver pendant, but sports a silver waistband. He does lack back printing, which is unfortunate, but oh well.</p>

<p>His accessory, which if I&#39;m not mistaking was new for the figure, is a very fitting, but also very dark. It&#39;s a club that was literally used for thwacking criminals, making its inclusion surprising. It looks great, and it&#39;s actually relatively small.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the Constable, and this is yet another 4 out of 5 figure for me. I love the concept, and I think it&#39;s executed nicely, especially with the introduction of two new parts.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
