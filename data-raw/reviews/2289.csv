I recomment it for a sibling project as the older child will find this&nbsp;challenging enough to put together with the aid of the younger ones. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Parts: </p><p>There is plenty of variety in this set including card wall panels.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Playability:</p><p>Also there are many different characters and vehicles to role play together with. The police dog is also a cute touch. While the building holds together fairly well, the barrier area can be a bit weak.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
