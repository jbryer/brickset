<p>First off this Mini-Figure introduces a brand new hat, with elf-ears attached, many believe this is an indication that LEGO could pursue the rights to make Legend of Zelda toys, which would be neat, personally I just think this is a nifty new piece to incorporate into MOCs and stuff. He's pretty much all various shades of green, a single-sided dark green torso printed with a festive looking jacket, what most elves wear in Christmas specials.</p>
<p>The legs are shorty legs, a lighter green color to match the cap, no printing here naturally. His face has a big goofy/happy smile showing a gap toothed print and that covers the Mini-Fig. He is the easiest to find with the feel method because LEGO included a square brick with printed tile to represent a wrapped preasent. You'll have no trouble finding an army of this little dude because of that. He also comes with Sleepyhead's teddy bear piece in a nice dark brown, a little red bowtie printed around his neck, it's a fun repaint accessory.</p>
<p>Overall, get him, get tons of him, populate your Winter Village with this and the Series 8 Santa and voilla, instant Christmas Village. MOC some impressive Legend of Zelda ideas if you want, all I know is he's a very good offering from Series 11 and I'm glad LEGO made it available. Here's hoping that they make a pink girl elf eventually because then we can have some classic Rudolph displays in LEGO form.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3

<p>&nbsp;The holiday elf is a very fun and iconic character that Lego nailed back in 2013 .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hat ear combo is quite nice and accurate but is surprisingly not dual moulded but that makes sense as dual moulding was not particularly main stream until 2014 , his head has a cheerful print with a noticeable gap between his teeth , his torso is nice but lacks back printing and his legs are the short design in light green .</p>

<p>His accessories-</p>

<p>His accessories include a 2&times;2 red brick with a printed 2&times;2 red tile into to show a bow for gift and a teddy bear with a print on the front but unfortunately over time I have lost the bear but still have the gift but I do plan to purchase another in future . His stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a fun figure and fits well with festive scenes but isn&#39;t easy to get nowadays but I recommend it to those who desire one .</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-17T20:07:39.69Z","FESTIVELY great!","<p>As I said in my review of the Series 11 Gingerbread Man, Series 11 features 3 classic Christmas/winter themed characters, the second being the Holiday Elf. Though we have seen this trope redone dozens of times after this CMF, this was the first minifigure to use this trope in the history of LEGO, if I&#39;m not mistaking.</p>

<p>Starting off the figure is&nbsp;what may be the most interesting piece of the figure, the hair/ear combo. Of course, that piece has since been used dozens of times, but believe it or not, it was a brand new piece made exclusively for this CMF. It is not dual-moulded, rather, the yellow ears are printed onto the green base, and the hat itself sports some fantastic moulding along the top, where it curves to a tip.</p>

<p>Next is the face, which is honestly super adorable! I adore the squints around the eyes, and the noticeable gap in his teeth is absolutely fantastic. It fits superbly, and I&#39;m really not sure why! He doesn&#39;t have an alternate expression, but that&#39;s okay, since the figure is already swell.</p>

<p>As expected, the torso is stellar! The yellow stitching around the green collar is appreciated, as well as the brown belt. The gold buckle in the centre reminds of his boss, Santa! Believe it or not, it&#39;s caste in a different colour than the hat. The hat and legs are both the same colour, while the torso is a darker shade. No back torso or arm printing is incorporated, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>The legs are those small, non-nendable parts, which fit&nbsp;wonderfully here! I appreciate how it&#39;s a slightly lighter shade than the torso, as mentioned, and getting them in that colour is brilliant!</p>

<p>The figure itself is marvellous, but the accessories are just as brilliant! A teddy bear is included, and the Holiday Elf made it for Santa&#39;s sleigh, no doubt. It&#39;s a recolour of the Series 6 Sleepyhead&#39;s accessory, and the red bow-tie, as well as the tan around his mouth and stomach make it exclusive. A red present is also included. Though it isn&#39;t the empty box design that is sometimes included with newer CMF&#39;s, it&#39;s inclusion is definitely appreciated! It uses a plain red 2x2 brick, with an exclusive printed 2x2 tile. I love the implementation of the gift, considering it&#39;s entirely unnecessary!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this figure, and I&#39;m a sucker for holiday-themed CMF&#39;s, which is why I legit love this character. Not only does it have a new hair-ear combo, but it features excellent prints, amazing accessories, and fantastic value for 3 US dollars. I&#39;ve said this with nearly every Series 11 review so far, but the Holiday Elf has to be one of my favourites in the series.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
