"Odeinoichus","2013-10-23T07:40:16.357Z","Pretzel's for everyone","<p><strong>Set #71002 Pretzel Girl:</strong>&nbsp; She's a companion for the Lederhosen Guy from Series 8 and she looks great.</p>
<p>The Pretzel Girl is a fun looking Mini-Figure, and another one from the Cultures of the World type of Sub-Theme found in LEGO CMFs. Her torso is a nice solid dark green with a single-sided print featuring the traditional costume worn in Belgium (if I recall correctly), possibly also Dutchland. Anyway it's a nice looking print with a white frill revealing her neck and a small necklace&nbsp;with a locket of some type. The only printing on her legs are for her shoes, a black edge around the bottom of the feet. And she includes a cloth apron piece.</p>
<p>The cloth pieces are frustrating to get on correctly with someone who has adult sized hands, children may find it easier to correctly attach the piece, which is in two colors, white for the apron and dark green for the skirt portion. Her hair is the softer material used on all Friends Mini-Dolls, and features some nice long braided ponytails. Her facial print also has some nice details, I especially like the freckles on her cheeks.</p>
<p>Overall this is a great new Mini-Figure from Series 11 and worth tracking down, I think there's only two per case though so she is a bit tricky to find, especially as the pretzel accessory can be confused for the Mountain Climber's rope piece if searching quickly/casually. Recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3
"sideswinger","2022-09-08T21:19:35.8Z","just2great!!!","<p>If you&#39;ve ever watched the YouTuber just2good, you&#39;ve almost certainly heard of Pretzel Girl, a character who is notorious for being &quot;just2adorable,&quot; and for being one of Justin&#39;s favourites CMF&#39;s ever. Well, just2good, if you&#39;re reading this, I&#39;m a huge fan, and you have good taste, because this is a legitimately good figure, and one of my favourites in the series. But why? Well, let&#39;s take a closer look.</p>

<p>On top, we have a hairpiece that was brand new for the figure! I really love the moulded work along the front, and how it&#39;s swept to the side, and her pigtails are, admittedly, adorable, and very intricately moulded. It&#39;s coloured in a brilliant blonde tone that fits the figure!</p>

<p>Okay, so maybe just2good is right, because this figure has a really cute face. I love her big, cheeky smile, and the freckles around her eyes are great. She has no alternate facial expression, but that is to be expected, since alternate expressions were rare back then.</p>

<p>Next is her torso, which sports some great attire. The colour combination of dark green, dark red, and white contrasts nicely with her yellow skin, and I appreciate the small pendant necklace. She doesn&#39;t have back torso printing, but oh well.</p>

<p>And before we move on to the legs, I love her skirt, which is a nice inclusion and one that I really appreciate. Again, the dark green and white colour combination works nicely, and there&#39;s actually a knot design on the back, which I really love.</p>

<p>There really isn&#39;t much happening at the legs; all we get is some printed shoes, which I still really appreciate.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessory, and that pretzel piece was actually introduced with the Series 8 Lederhosen Guy, which is the original character to have this trope; the Pretzel Girl is merely a gender swap. But, given her name, this is a fitting accessory that I&#39;m always eager to have.</p>

<p>That is it for this review, and overall, I do really adore this figure. While she isn&#39;t my favourite of the series (that title would have to go to the Scarecrow), she&#39;s easily in my top 5. I&#39;m gonna give her a 5 out of 5, and if I&#39;m being totally honest, she is just too good.</p>
