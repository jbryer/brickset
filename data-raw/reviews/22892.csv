<p>The detail work on his print is brilliant, with a patchwork design that looks like an old Farmer's shirt and faded pants full of patches and some straw poking out of his shirt. A rope belt and some much appreciated side-arm printing this will look great next to a Lion Tribe member, a 'Tin Man' and a little farm girl from Kansas in a Wizard of Oz MOC.</p>
<p>What's more he's got a brand new floppy hat with a hole in top so you can attach the new crow animal from Lone Ranger onto him. He's also got a rare color of head and hands and a pitchfork. (An accessory that isn't seen too often in LEGO sets these days.)</p>
<p>Overall, he's two to a case, but the pitchfork makes him really easy to find using the feel method. Get one, get two if you can, snag three if you're really that in love with him. Strongly recommended.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,3,3

The sight of crimson coloured leaves makes for some truly beautiful sights, especially towards the middle of the season. Of course, fall accompanies Halloween, which has got to be one of my all-time favourite holidays. Honestly, candy corn is my favourite part of fall, but you get my point: I love fall. Thus, the LEGO Minifigures Series 11 Scarecrow has got to be one of my favourites in the series. He was released back in 2013, where he included 7 pieces, and only retailed for $2.99 in US dollars. Now let&#39;s take a closer look to see some other reasons why I love this figure!</p>

<p>At the top is that hat piece. The crow is a separate piece that connects via a hole at the top, and the crow was not new for the figure, but because it was introduced with the Lone Ranger sets, it was a relatively new piece for the time. I dig that crow, and while it could benefit from printing, it&#39;s a really solid inclusion to the character. Of course, it attaches to that hat, and that piece itself was actually, believe it or not, new to the figure. The entire mould is caste in red-brown, and I dig the printed detailing around the rim. No cap, that hat may be my favourite piece of this whole figure.</p>

<p>Next is his face, which looks soulless, but still pretty adorable. The stitched mouth is very creative, as is the buttons used for eyes. There isn&#39;t any back head printing, but that&#39;s okay, since it&#39;s not super common even nowadays.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has some phenomenal detailing. I love the muted tan, as well as the stitching around the collar, the pocket, and that lone green patch is an excellent touch, and a great pop of colour. Not only does the plaid design carry on to the back of the torso, where we have a dark brown patch, but the plaid is even captured on the arms, which is something I would not expect. It&#39;s printed really nicely, and it adds a lot to the figure.</p>

<p>Moving down, we have his legs, which are caste in a great sand blue colour that contrasts beautifully with the torso, and there are more patches of various tones of brown sewed into the fabric. I love how seamlessly the waistband is carried from the stomach to the legs, as well as the shirt itself.</p>

<p>Finally, we have his accessory, it being that pitch fork. Even though it wasn&#39;t new or anything like that, I absolutely adore its inclusion here, seeing as it was fairly uncommon back then. It&#39;s caste in the usual red-brown, and it makes for such an incredible accessory that really tops off the figure for me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the&nbsp;figure! Overall, this Scarecrow is probably my literal favourite of the series. Not only is it an insanely original character, but it&#39;s executed absolutely perfectly. I can&#39;t think of a way LEGO could&#39;ve improved upon this figure, making it&nbsp;5 out of 5 for me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
