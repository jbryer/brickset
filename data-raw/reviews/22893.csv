<p>Dressed all in red and black this Mountaineer has a nice uniform look to him, he's got a single-sided torso print with a thick looking warm jacket for when he reaches the higher areas of the mountain, he has some ration pouches clipped to his belt and a nifty looking logo on his right breast. He also has harnesses printed on his legs, and he's wearing a protective helmet we've seen many times before on other sports enthusiast Mini-Figs.</p>
<p>Accessorywise he's got this thin rubbery coil of rope, not sure if it's actual rubber or a rubber based plastic, he also has the huge pickaxe... Uh... LEGO, I hate to say this, but most climbers tend to use smaller tools to help pound the pitons in. I mean it's fair enough that they might not have wanted to mold a new piece, however... From what I recall LEGO already has a smaller tool that would have worked out just fine here, the LEGO Res-Q Subtheme featured a bunch of tools and one of them was a small chisel looking piece that would have worked out much better with the Mountain Climber than the boring old samey pickaxe.</p>
<p>The facial print is a nice looking one too, with a big teeth revealing smile and some protective eye wear this Mini-Fig is ready to climb any heights. Overall I think you can't truly go wrong with him, he might be a bit less impressive than such figures as the Island Warrior or the Scarecrow, but at the end of the day he's still a great buy and a welcome addition to the Collectible Mini-Figure series.</p>",TRUE,3,2,1,2,3

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Splendid&nbsp;paint scheme - on both the torso and the legs/trousers parts.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The pick must be a joke, really. It belongs to road construction set, or at most geo prospector hands, but here?! Why on Earth LEGO elected this&nbsp;part instead of <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4567879"">ice-axe&nbsp;</a>will remain their -shameful enough- mystery.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Face paint: good, but might be better still.&nbsp;One might prefer a sort of alpinist facemask / goggles coming as a&nbsp;separate part, not just being fix-painted. Or how about double-face variant?<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Why exactly is this guy&nbsp;missing his backpack?! That it by far the widest fault and a blow to&nbsp;the figure&#39;s playability, otherwise offering top marks potential. And&nbsp;thinking of backpack allowing attachment of the rope and ice-axe, wow, <strong>that</strong>&nbsp;might be nice.<br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Rope: nice idea, though some for of attaching it to the figure or putting around his arms might be good.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Summing up: a decently good figure, with great potential, to some extent wasted by a number of corners cut short by its design. Still a very nice addition to ones <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City"">City</a>&nbsp;- or <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Adventurer"">Adventurers</a>&nbsp;- themed sets.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-18T15:12:39.987Z","great CONCEPT!","<p>LEGO Minifigures Series 11 has some of the best CMF&#39;s ever seen in the theme up to 2013. Some are incredibly detailed, with brand new pieces, and some are fantastic concepts that contrast wonderfully with the rest of the series. Mountain Climber is undeniably one of the best ideas of the entire series, and while it may not be quite as detailed as some others, it&#39;s a fantastic CMF.</p>

<p>On top is a red, protective helmet. It wasn&#39;t new for the minifigure or anything, but it fits masterfully, so I love it being here. The intricate notches at the top make for a great piece, and getting it in red is great.</p>

<p>The head print could definitely be better, but I still appreciate the dark shades around the eyes. This may be an unpopular opinion, but I much prefer the glasses being printed, rather than a separate piece that would otherwise clutter the figure. Of course, the figure has no alternate expression, but that makes complete sense, considering it&#39;d be severely exposed.</p>

<p>The torso sports some attire that really reminds me of LEGO City, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. The black arms contrast against the red torso, which looks nice against the yellow flesh. I dig the strap around his torso, as well as the silver zipper underneath. However, I really dislike how he has no back printing. The figure itself, while still being good, isn&#39;t as detailed as most other figures in the series, so back printing definitely could&#39;ve sufficed. Instead, none is implemented.</p>

<p>The legs represent great detail! A black strap covers one leg, while a blue safety lock occupies the other. No side leg printing, which again, would&#39;ve been great to get, but oh well.</p>

<p>Accessory wise, he includes a piece that I believe was brand new to the figure, that being the coil. It&#39;s caste in a soft material that works really nicely, and the moulding on it is very impressive for a 2013 minifigure. The figure also has a&nbsp; pick-axe, and realistically, a mountain climber would have a much smaller tool to climb with, but I didn&#39;t know that until reading the other reviews for the figure, so I can&#39;t complain much about that. It&#39;s always a nice piece to get, anyway.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure, and no, this is, in no way, my favourite in the series. I think it lacks in detail, especially at the back, which looks super plain. I think the side of the legs could&#39;ve benefited from detail as well. But I still really love this figure, not only for the new coil piece, but because it&#39;s a brilliant concept that really works for a CMF. I love when LEGO does uncommon civilian tropes for Minifigures, as it makes for an easy way to collect that particular occupation, and I think LEGO nailed it here. At the end of the day, I&#39;m giving this character a 4 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review, thanks for reading!</p>
