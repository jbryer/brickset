"Odeinoichus","2013-10-18T06:13:09.29Z","Aged Starlet?","<p><strong>Set #71002 Grandma: </strong>Series 10 featured a crotchedy old timer, why not Series 11?</p>
<p>The Grandma is a nice companion piece, not only for Series 10's Grandpa, but also for Series 7's Grandma Visitor. With some rare light blue Mini-Figure legs, a light purple torso with sweater print and a brand new style of LEGO Cat this Mini-Figure offers up some great parts. She has a simple one-sided torso print a pleasant smiling face and the Hollywood Starlet's hairpiece in grey. Perhaps she is the Starlet after years of being up on the big LEGO screen? (nah, probably not.)</p>
<p>Overall while she might come off as a weaker member of the Series 11 Mini-Figures you can't go wrong with this LEGO Grandma, she even comes complete with a large purse/basket for knitting yarn. And the new Cat piece is a nice addition to the LEGO Animals collection. I recommend her.</p>",TRUE,2,2,1,2,2

"sideswinger","2022-09-21T02:12:20.16Z","an old GEM!","<p>Series 10 is arguably one of the worst series&#39;&nbsp;ever, with very few memorable or charming characters. The Series 10 Grandpa was an exception, however.&nbsp; Therefore, in the follow-up series, we got Grandma! Even though my grandma despises cats and most other animals, this figure looks a lot like her, so I&#39;m pretty hyped to review her! (I mean the figure, not my grandma.)</p>

<p>Right off the bat, we get a fantastic hairpiece. It&#39;s the Series 9 Hollywood Starlet&#39;s hair recast in grey, and boy, does it look incredible and fitting! The bunches around the bottom rim, as well as the strand that hangs in front the face feels super fitting, and I really think LEGO picked the absolute best hairpiece to include with the figure.</p>

<p>Her head print is, much like the hair, great! Not only do&nbsp;her big, red glasses remind me of my great aunt, but her small, compressed mouth just looks so happy that every time I see this figure I want to smile! It really is an infectious face!</p>

<p>As for her torso, it&#39;s surprisingly fitting as well! Though my own personal grandma wouldn&#39;t wear something cat-themed, the printing on it looks fantastic. I like the red-beaded necklace, but the lack of back printing is somewhat unfortunate.</p>

<p>Her legs, whilst having no printing, are caste in a splendid spring blue colour that matches the torso nicely!</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her accessories, both of which are incredible! Her basket wasn&#39;t new for the series or anything, but it&#39;s a nice callback to the Series 9 Grandma Visitor, who included a basket of this exact colour. But obviously, the best and most important part of this entire figure has to be that cat, which was a brand new piece for the figure. I love and adore cats, kittens, and everything feline-related, so obviously this piece is perfect in every way. It&#39;s adorable, it has great printed detail, and it&#39;s caste in a brilliant light grey colour that totally fits for a Grandma minifigure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure, and overall, the concept of having a generic &quot;grandma&quot; figure is brilliant, and I like her a lot more than the Series 10 Grandpa. Not only does she have superior printing, but her cat piece absolutely steals the show for me, and it makes her a solid 5 out of 5 CMF, in my book.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review! Thanks for reading!</p>
