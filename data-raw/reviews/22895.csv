","The rare Island Warrior is probably one of those pains.&nbsp; The first pain is the find him (I hear he only come two in a box).&nbsp; The second pain I have with him is the face mask it is a rubbery substance and the one I got&nbsp;was bent at the neck area.&nbsp; If you want to find him I would feel for the spear or the little bone that attaches to the hair.&nbsp; ",FALSE,3,3,1,2,3
"Odeinoichus","2013-10-19T09:40:38.503Z","The Return of Islanders","<p><strong>Set #71002 Island Warrior:</strong> Speaking as a LEGO collector who grew up with the Pirates sets of the late 80s early 90s, this Mini-Figure is a great re-visit to a Subtheme I always enjoyed from the Pirates Theme.</p>
<p>The Island Warrior is using parts we last saw in the Cannibal Escape from PotC, the hair piece which hadn't been seen since the 90s Islanders sets, instead of the plumes that were introduced to fit in the hair, they use the newer dog bone piece, which some might think makes a bit more sense. Personally I would have rather seen the plume come back. Perhaps next time.</p>
<p>He has a simple single sided torso print showing a bare chest with tribal markings and some native belt design. He also has printing on his legs for the grass skirt, it might have been nicer if LEGO had re-used the hula dancers grass skirt to enhance this Mini-Fig even more, but considering the new tribal mask piece they gave us with him I can see where including the hula skirt might not have been possible.</p>
<p>Speaking of the mask it's made out of a soft rubber and features a lot of great painted detail work, it looks like an actual tribal mask found in the Hawaiian isles. It's a great new piece, with one minor issue, both of the Warriors I picked up had the neck brackets slightly warped, the material used can be a bit of an issue here.</p>
<p>Overall he's a great offering from Series 11, even the tribal markings on his facial print are a great nod to the older Islanders Mini-Figs and with that spear accessory he's easy to feel for. Despite being a small number per case for this figure. Definitely recommend tracking this one down.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4

<p>Including the bone which goes on the minifigures hair there are three pieces. The first of which is the basic black 3x4 CMF stand. Second is the spear which is a basic reddish brown spear. The last piece is the bone. It is a basic bone but even then, it looks great.</p>

<h3>Minifigure:</h3>

<p>Being a CMF the minifigure is the whole set. To begin with, the hair piece is the same that was used in the classic Islanders theme, but it still looks great here. It is a black hair piece that includes a clip sticking up from the top to give the effect of the bone being tied into the hair. The head features a smiley expression which is covered with magnificent blue markings. The next piece, the mask, is the main standout piece of the minifig. The detail is splendid and is very colorful featuring four different colors, red, green, brown, and a tannish white. The face created with the mask and the giant eyes are amazing completing the tribal feel of the minifig. Next is the torso, which features a highly detailed front but a plain, unprinted, back. The torso&#39;s printing shows the same blue markings as on the face as well as a tribal necklace and sash that goes over the red waistband which is the main detail that should&#39;ve been continued onto the back. The feet have a green grass skirt that is printed around the side of the legs but does not continue to the back.</p>

<h3>Playability:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Playability is really endless with this minifig. He includes a weapon, so he can fight off any wild beasts, or he could just go on some magnificent journey. Who knows it&#39;s up to you!</p>

<h3>Value for Money:</h3>

<p>The original cost of the minifigure was&nbsp;&pound;1.99 / $2.99 which is well worth the quality of the minifig and the playability.</p>

<h3>Overall:</h3>

<p>Overall this is an excellent CMF with great value for money, and great playability. The only complaint would be to include back printing. Other than the lack of back printing this is an amazing minifig.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-15T18:55:47.927Z","great MASK PIECE!","<p>Historical CMF&#39;s aren&#39;t something I&#39;m necessarily big on. That&#39;s not to say they&#39;re bad; I&#39;m just not too crazy about them. Series 11 has the boring Barbarian minifigure, which I found to be the worst historical CMF yet. However, Series 11 has another history/warrior themed figure, that being the Island Warrior. This character includes 7 pieces, and since this was released all the way back in 2013, it retailed for only $2.99, which is insane, next to todays CMF price tag.</p>

<p>Starting from the top, we have that LEGO Islanders hair piece. Though that was not new for the figure, this was the first time we ever got that piece in a cheap CMF! There is a decent amount of moulding around the rim, as well as a small white bone that clips into the top. I think that hair really fits the figure!</p>

<p>Honestly, the head print for this figure looks a little eery. It almost appears too happy, for a trope like this. Either way, I like the intricate blue markings around the eyes, and it almost resembles fangs.</p>

<p>Of course, the centrepiece of this minifigure is that massive tiki mask, and yes, it is, undoubtedly, the best part of the figure. It&#39;s made of soft rubber, and caste in a red-brown tone that really fits! Of course, it was moulded specifically for this figure, which I really appreciate. And my gosh, the printing on it is phenomenal! From the green leaves at the top, to the white teeth, to the red wrapped around those massive eyes, it looks so incredible! I could talk about the mask all day, but we must move on.</p>

<p>All good things must come to an end, and I feel like the torso is slightly underwhelming. It isn&#39;t bad or anything, it&#39;s just relatively simple. I still&nbsp;like the red waistband, as well as what appears to be a sash made of bones, but the lack of back torso printing is a bit sad.</p>

<p>Moving on, we have his legs, which are well done! I love the tattered green shorts, and the fact that they carry on to the sides of the legs as well is a fantastic touch. I love side-leg and arm printing on CMF&#39;s!</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his brown spear accessory, which I guess I appreciate enough. The fact that it&#39;s included at all is great, and it&#39;s caste in a pretty useful dark brown tone.</p>

<p>That is it for this minifigure! Overall, I don&#39;t particularly love historical CMF&#39;s, and the other history themed figure found in Series 11, the Barbarian, is pretty bad. However, with all that being said, I do really like this figure! It isn&#39;t the best history figure ever, but the mask is just so detailed and intricate that it&#39;s hard not to love! So at the end of the day, I&#39;m gonna give this a generous 4 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks&nbsp;for reading!</p>
