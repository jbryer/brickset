<p>The Gingerbread Man is one of those rare types of Mini-Figures that you look back upon with fondness and pure fun. Seriously this figure when first concieved by the LEGO people was just icing to top off the cake, it's sugary sweetness all rolled flat and cut-out. Ok enough with the bad puns.</p>
<p>GM is a nice soft brown color, he has intricate detail work woven in, and I don't mean just the frosted icing buttons or other frosted areas of the print work, this Mini-Figure has a slew of tiny dots as part of his detail work, not sure what kind of cookie dough they were aiming at replicating, but it is a welcome design element that adds to the uniqueness of the figure.</p>
<p>The head is a nice change too, it's unique, not just some mask worn by a standard head, but a fully sculpted and molded three layer creme filled cookie being used as the head. Brilliant, sheer brilliance.</p>
<p>Overall you can't go wrong with this MF and while I'm uncertain as to how they can maximize the use of the new head, I'm kind of partial to Oreo Man next time LEGO, this Mini-Figure is well worth owning. Especially when they include a red mug for dunking with the words Dunk Me on it, it's just... Clever tongue in cheek humour you come to expect from LEGO. I believe he's four to a case, and the mug is a dead giveaway, not too terribly hard to find especially when he has a different head from all the rest. Add him to your collection today.</p>",TRUE,5,2,1,4,5

He&#39;s also frosted on the arms, legs, and feet! his cookie shaped head makes this dude completely irresistible!</p>

<p>Overall this minifigure&nbsp;is well priced and a great highlight in Lego collecting&nbsp;I&#39;ll never forget.</p>

"Studded_Dud","2020-08-02T21:11:49.413Z","Awesome Cookie","<p>Parts: This set includes 5 pieces, all of which have printing except for the generic minifigure series stand. He holds a red cup that says dunk me and has a very fun moulded head.</p>

<p>Playability: The playability for this set would increase even more if you own the gingerbread house set. Even without that set this gingerbread man is one of the greatest minifigures to be made.</p>

<p>Value for Money: Originally costing&nbsp;&pound;1.99 / $2.99 and including 5 pieces, this set is well worth the value. The minifigure looks awesome and it fits in perfectly with anything Christmas!</p>

<p>Minifigure: The minifigure is obviously a gingerbread man. His legs and body have frosting printing on them as a generic gingerbread man would have. His face has a frosting mouth and frosting eyebrows. His eyes look great too. His head is moulded and makes him seem like a three layer gingerbread man. His whole body is covered in little dots just like regular gingerbread is. The detail on this minifigure is amazing!</p>

<p>Overall: Overall this is probably in the top 5 of best minifigure&nbsp;series characters out there. He is one awesome cookie!</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-16T14:49:16.753Z","SWEET!","<p>The newly announced series, at the time of writing this, is LEGO Minifigures Series 23, a set which includes a roster of Christmas and festive themed characters. However, it isn&#39;t the only CMF series to include that trope. LEGO Minifigures Series 11 includes three! My favourite of the three would have to be the Gingerbread Man, a figure who is not only a spectacular concept, but is surprisingly detailed! He was released back in 2013 where it retailed for $2.99, and includes 5 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Right off the bat, we have a brand-new piece, of course being that gingerbread head. That piece is, correct me if I&#39;m wrong, dual-moulded, with a dark sliver of creme caste between two gingerbread cookies, and there are two small cut-outs in the front to accommodate those big, puppy-dog eyes. Crumbs are printed around the face (none at the back, unfortunately), and the icing mouth really is the icing on the cake!</p>

<p>Of course, the torso is also magnificent. I really dig the icing collar, and while I wish they were instead made of gumdrops, the buttons look delicious. Those lines of icing on the torso continue onto the back, where it is accompanied by more crumbs, and there&#39;s even some icing on the side of the arms, which I definitely appreciate!</p>

<p>Finishing off the base of the figure itself is the legs, which have more printed detailing. Once again, the white strips of icing are accompanied by miniscule crumbs, and there&#39;s even some icing shoes.</p>

<p>This figure has a red cup for an accessory, which I appreciate the fact that LEGO included an accessory at all! It has an adorable &quot;DUNK ME!&quot; printed on the front, which feels appropriate!</p>

<p>Overall, the Gingerbread Man, despite getting redone in the 2019 Winter Village set, is one of my favourite, most original CMFs! It&#39;s adorable, it uses a new part, and it&#39;s just such a stellar and innovative idea that appeals to my Christmas-loving self. At the end of the day, though this is not my favourite of the series, it&#39;s gotta be in the top 3! I&#39;m giving it a 5 out of 5.</p>

<p>That is all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
