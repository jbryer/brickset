"Odeinoichus","2013-10-17T19:00:14.65Z","The Weakest Link","<p><strong>Set #71002 Barbarian:</strong> Series 11 is full of great Mini-Figures, I can't find fault with many of them. That being said, like a lot of fans of the CMF Theme I think LEGO dropped the ball inserting this fig into one of the slots.</p>
<p>The Barbarian is dull, plain and simple, we've already seen a lot of decent historical Mini-Figs through the first ten series, unfortunately this one is just not that inspiring. Ok though, he does have an impressive level of detail in his print, LEGO took a tiny brush to him and worked their particular brand of magic. With a double-sided bare chested torso showing off the top of his furry shorts and a belt over well muscled abs and chest. His legs have a decent level of printing with that rare bit of side printing that makes all the difference. He's also got some side printing on his arms, which is again not seen very often.</p>
<p>It's just a shame that all this brilliant level of detail is wasted on a figure that just doesn't add much to the table. He includes two short swords, the easiest method for finding him if you're looking is to feel for them.</p>
<p>Overall I'd say you can easily skip this dude if you have tons of Jungle Boys, Gladiators and similar Mini-Figs. If you're aiming to get a complete set you'll want him, I just think that there are a lot better offerings from Series 11. Still I am curious to know if LEGO will create a Female Barbarian as a companion for him, unless that's what the Warrior Woman was supposed to be.</p>",TRUE,2,1,1,2,2

<p>The only downside is that if you get this, it doesn&#39;t really work with any existing Lego sets. Lego doesn&#39;t have any barbarian sets, so you would have to make a special MOC for this guy if you actually planned on using him.</p>

<p>I promptly disassembled him and used his parts for a Skyrim-esque&nbsp;MOC. The legs and chest worked really well for a medieval/barbarian/viking style MOC, since they&#39;re so detailed. I would recommend this guy for parts if you&#39;re into that kind of MOCing.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-07T02:21:45.777Z","BAD historical figure!","<p>The first minifigure found in LEGO Minifigures Series 11 is the Barbarian. This minifigure was released in September 2013, where it retailed for $2.99 and included 7 pieces. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>On top of the minifigure is a hairpiece that isn&#39;t all too special, but it was a tad bit harder to get back when this released. There really isn&#39;t anything interesting about it, but I guess it fits the figure good enough.</p>

<p>If you enjoy making your own LEGO stop motion movies, particularly with historical or maybe a western setting, this head will be useful for you. I dig the angry scowl, as well as his surprisingly profound cheekbones. Of course, he does have a small stubble, and even a small scratch beside his eye. No alternate face print is incorporated.</p>

<p>Next is his torso, which has some pretty good detail, I suppose. I like the gold strap around his stomach, as well as the leather strap around his shoulder, which is actually carried onto the back, as is the gold waistband. The figure&#39;s arms have some great brown wristbands, so I guess that&#39;s a plus.</p>

<p>Next are his legs, which have some decent detail. I like the jagged, ripped up shorts, but the yellow printing&nbsp;on the brown base does hurt the quality of it a bit.&nbsp; He has side leg printing, which I find pretty generous.</p>

<p>His accessories are not one, but two small swords. Those pieces aren&#39;t exactly excellent, but the inclusion of two is pretty great. They weren&#39;t new to the figure or anything like that, but they fit the character.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure! Overall, I would love to say this figure is fantastic, and one of the best in the series, but then I&#39;d be a liar. At the end of the day, I really do not like this character. He&#39;s easily one of the most forgettable CMF&#39;s ever, and he has no new pieces or new colours for anything. This is easily one of the worst historical themed CMF&#39;s ever, and he is by far my least favourite of this entire series. He gets a very weak 2 out of 5 for me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
