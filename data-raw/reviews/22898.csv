(Like the mountain climber’s rope or the gingerbread man’s head, although it’s distinctive enough that you should be able to tell the difference after a bit.)&nbsp; Although the fig’s coloring is an odd choice, she comes with enough cool recolors (and a new hairpiece) to be worth collecting.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2013-10-23T08:47:45.123Z","Order Up","<p><strong>Set #71002 Diner Waitress: </strong>When I first saw images of this Mini-Figure I was a bit turned off by the color chosen for the body. Her cream/tan colored torso didn't really strike me as a good idea, seeing her in person I'm pleased to change my mind.</p>
<p>The Diner Waitress is, or rather was, a staple of the 1950's. When drive-thru restaurants meant sitting down in your car and having the waitress come up to you, a fad that continued for some decades more before eventually dying out. This Mini-Figure is a nice piece of historical pop culture for a LEGO Mini-Fig, and looks great while standing out as someone who could also be in a modern LEGO City display.</p>
<p>She has a great looking torso print, with the uniform and apron carrying down from the torso to the legs, a small notebook for taking orders is barely visible tucked into her apron's pocket, and this is one of the Mini-Figure's with visible legs between the skirt print and her shoes. Her name tag says her name is Tara, and she's wearing a small heart shaped pendant necklace.</p>
<p>Accessories include the tray from Series 9's Waiter and a clear glass with four scoops of strawberry ice cream. Her hair is totally brand new, with a nice swirl pattern in front and a ponytail in the back, it's a vast improvement over the Scientists' plain re-used hair piece so I like that. Also she is the only Mini-Figure from this Series to include a double-sided face, much like with Series 10 there aren't very many double-sided faces. Her expression is happy and pleased to serve you on one side, and slightly less than pleased on the other.</p>
<p>Overall this is a strong offering from Series 11, though perhaps not at first glance due to the choice in coloring for the torso. It's also great to get another Mini-Figure with the new rollerskate accessory (this time in pink), I hope to see many more rollerskating Mini-Figs in the future. Definitely recommend picking her up, be aware she's two per case though.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,4

"8BrickMario","2017-04-26T20:16:40.13Z","Drive on by!","<p>A classic roller waitress minifigure? Why not? &nbsp;Wait, she&#39;s yellow, wearing yellow? Uh-oh.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The skates, tray, ice cream, and cup will all be useful and likely desirable, as will the hair.</p>

<h3>The Minifigure</h3>

<p>Well, first thing to address- the color scheme. In real life, the yellows aren&#39;t nearly as similar as the CGI rendering makes them look, so that&#39;s not really a problem with the figure. In fact, the yellow, pink, and blue are a very bright and cheery retro palette that I really like. The Waitress&#39; hair is an interesting new piece, with a swirled section at the front, and a ponytail at the back, which is not visible from a head-on angle. It&#39;s a darker nougat tone. Her face is nice, with some blue rhinestoned cat-eye glasses, and a cheery expression on one side and a grumpy one on the other. Her uniform itself, though, doesn&#39;t read well to me in terms of its shape. For one, it lacks sleeves, which is uncharacteristic of the time- short sleeves would have been appropriate, but this was before dual-molded arms. And the end of the uniform is just printed on the legs, including the apron, which looks very sloppy. A skirt piece with the apron and the bottom of the outfit would have been more accurate and would have been much clearer. Also, her legs are printed with a band of yellow for a break in the uniform, but her shoes/boots/whatever are the same color as the rest, which also confuses me. I do like the collar and buttons on the uniform, as well as her name tag, and the additional seams printed on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She comes with the classic carhop roller skates, here in bubble gum pink, and these are nice pieces. They have weak clutch at the bottom to avoid lifting the minifigure off the skates when placed on a base, and the design is simple but effective. Her other accessories are the Waiter&#39;s tray in white (no stud on top for a better empty look) and an ice cream in a glass, which are perfect for completing the look.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>She&#39;s a flawed design, but I think she has enough charm and retro goodness to make her worthwhile.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-20T21:08:42.497Z","great parts, but seriously HINDERED!","<p>Not to critique this early in the review, but one of the weirdest and wackiest CMF&#39;s ever, for me personally, has to be the Diner Waitress. There&#39;s just so much colours, pieces, prints, and goodness knows what, that the focus for the figure always did seem off to me. But that&#39;s not to say it&#39;s a bad figure, and maybe my opinion will change when I finish this review! Like the rest of the series, this retailed for $2.99, but in contrast to most early 2010&#39;s CMF&#39;s, it features a whopping 10 pieces. Enough rambling; let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Right off the bat, her hair piece was new for the figure... okay? I honestly don&#39;t understand the choice of introducing a new hair piece, but I mean, I won&#39;t complain. It looks a little funky, especially at the front, but the back has some excellent moulding that looks a lot more complex than LEGO&#39;s usual pony-tail piece. It&#39;s caste in nougat, and it&#39;s a hair piece we&#39;ve rarely ever seen since then, if ever.</p>

<p>Her face print does a good job capturing the happy 50&#39;s vibe, and her chipper smile is honestly pretty adorable. The choice of blue glasses is a little strange, and at the end of this review we&#39;re gonna count all the weird colour choices, the glasses of which are the first.&nbsp; For some crazy reason, LEGO gave this figure an alternate expression. While strange, I love that inclusion! The print itself is a bit of a confused look, which feels appropriate.</p>

<p>Moving on, the torso does sport great printing. I appreciate the small name tag, but there&#39;s no back printing here, which definitely feels missing. Now clearly, the colour choice is absolutely wacky. This print would&#39;ve worked on a flesh-toned figure, but spring yellow against dark yellow flesh just does not work. It clashes horribly. Light blue would&#39;ve looked SO much better, so I certainly question&nbsp;LEGO&#39;s colour combination.</p>

<p>The legs have the same colour combination issue, because the dark yellow flesh printed on the front (and sides, surprisingly,) looks like some weird fashion design, versus skin. I do like the blue apron that carries on from the torso to the legs, but I still can&#39;t forgive the strange colour combination.</p>

<p>Before we look at the accessories, this character has roller skates, which are brilliant inclusions! They were new for the figure in that dark pink tone, and I&#39;ve always loved those moulds. Other reviews on Brickset claim they attach to the base weakly, so while I&#39;ve never had a problem with it, take that as you may.</p>

<p>Lastly, her accessories are pretty dang good. Three pieces make up the assembly: the tray, the bottle, and the bubbles. The tray wasn&#39;t a new mould, as it, like the skates, were first introduced in Series 9. However I think this might&#39;ve been a new colour for it. The clear bottle piece was not new by any means, but it&#39;s a great inclusion, as are the pink bubbles, that I suppose&nbsp;represent a strawberry ice cream milkshake.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the figure! Overall, I love her hair piece, and I love her roller skates. The figure itself has some phenomenal printing on the torso, legs, and both sides of the head, and her accessories are great! So why did I give this a 3 out of 5? Well, she&#39;s hindered by one massive issue: her colours. They just do NOT clash well, and it&#39;s a major situation that I&#39;m shocked LEGO didn&#39;t put a stop to. Overall, she has 5&nbsp;crazy colour choices, those being the nougat hair piece, the azure glasses, the spring yellow torso, the light blue apron, and the dark pink roller skates. Overall, this was a brilliant concept&nbsp;that was basically ruined by horrid colours.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. I know this was a bit long, so thanks for reading!</p>
