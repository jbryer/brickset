"Odeinoichus","2013-10-19T09:52:28.68Z","Science!","<p><strong>Set #71002 Scientist:</strong> One of the female Mini-Figures from Series 11, this is one fun little role model.</p>
<p>Dressed in a white lab coat which is printed on the front of the torso and the upper portion of her legs, you can see her purple shirt underneath at the neck line.&nbsp;She has a pen in her pocket and a name tag as well, a simple print which shows the level of detail LEGO is known for. She's carrying two flasks, one green and one blue.</p>
<p>The scientist is a great little Mini-Figure, unfortunately I am a bit dissapointed that LEGO didn't go with a different hair piece for her after the unique new pieces we got in Series 10; the same ponytail we've seen since CMF Series 1's Doctor/Nurse is a little bland.</p>
<p>Overall this one is definitely worth tracking down, since she includes two of the flasks we've seen with Mr. Good and Evil she can be found easily with the feel method. Also she has a nice rare color for her hands, the same light blue as the Yeti, perfect for custom Mini-Fig builders.</p>",TRUE,4,2,1,3,4

The Scientist falls into the latter catergory, and I think a plain scientist is an excellent choice for a CMF, considering the only other CMF scientist was the Crazy Scientist from Series 4, which was basically in Monster Fighters. I love simple concepts like this as minifigures, so I like this figure!</p>

<p>On top is that pony-tail hairpiece caste in dark brown. There isn&#39;t anything special or exclusive about it, but scientifically, hair is meant to be tied up while in the lab, so this piece feels appropriate.</p>

<p>The head print isn&#39;t anything to get worked up over, but it&#39;s always great to get generic faces with glasses, and LEGO did a good job of that with this character. No back face printing, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The torso is super useful outside the setting! I feel like it could pass as maybe a doctor or nurse. The small name tag&nbsp;is printed in grey, and I really dig the contrasting purple undershirt!</p>

<p>Her legs aren&#39;t super insane, but the fact that it&#39;s printed at all is highly appreciated. I like how seamlessly the buttons match up from the torso to the legs, and the pockets are fine additions.</p>

<p>As for the accessories, they weren&#39;t new pieces for the figure, but I think they might&#39;ve been moulded in new colours, those being translucent blue, and translucent yellow-green. The bottles are obviously fitting accessories,&nbsp;and I love seeing pieces caste in new colours.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for the Scientist, and overall, I dig this figure! Sure, it&#39;s far from being the most detailed of the series, but the civilian aesthetic is enough to make me love the figure. The useful pieces, like the head, torso, and bottles, are welcome inclusions, and overall, I gotta give her a 4 out of 5.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
