She plays with it often and calls the minifig something that sounds like 'Shumakah'. The car is nicely proportioned and rolls quite far on solid floors. It's one large piece, so there's not much to add to it, but she can fit other Duplo minifigs in it so they can get rides in the car. The set comes with a silver cup and a little winners podium. She loves it, so I give it 5 points. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
