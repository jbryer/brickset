<p>However most AFOLs will be after this book for the exclusive Minifigure, so reviewing from that mindset is very unhelpful for the younger crowd this is aimed at. So let's discuss the contents of the book from a new standpoint.</p>
<p>At 64 pages this is a much quicker read than most DK Books, it features pages that are set most often in-universe of the Star Wars universe. Detailing such things as Yoda's Allies, his Enemies, his Pupils and many other elements. It does not however go into too much detail concerning the actual Yoda Chronicles series. I liken it more of a slight companion piece to The Visual Dictionary, only without as much information per-page for the few sets that are mentioned in there.</p>
<p>It is an interesting change compared to the more 'grown-up' for lack of a better term books we've seen from DK before, however the younger crowd might find this to be a pretty fun little book. The price though is a bit high for the contents, considering most Character Encyclopedia's are priced at the same price (20.99$ in CND) for the amount of actual material here it is a bit lackluster from that stand point. I think a 12.99$ price tag might have been better. Of course if you find it at Costco you can get it for 10.99$, half the regular retail price and an excellent asking price for the actual contents.</p>
<p>As far as the Mini-Figure is concerned, this is another exclusive style of Clone being offered called the Special Forces Commander. He is of course made in China, however he has some excellent detail work with a great double-sided print on his torso much different from standard Clones and some leg printing. Considering his blue coloring I would assume he's part of Vader's 501st Legion. Appropriate considering he is using a standard Stormtrooper helmet with a much different print detail compared to typical Stormtroopers. Overall he's a pretty good exclusive compared to other offerings in the past.</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this book to the targeted age range, and while it might seem strange I still think it's a pretty decent book for AFOLs who can get past the more younger tone of this book compared to past ones. It would have been nice to have featured more pages about the actual special episodes that it takes its' title from though.</p>",TRUE,3,1,1,1,3
