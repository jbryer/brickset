<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Like all new sets this year, the box is small and compact and very little space is wasted inside. &nbsp;The front features this year&#39;s new &quot;LEGO The Hobbit&quot; logo and artwork which is quite appealing to the eye with a gold/blue colour scheme. &nbsp;As with a lot of sets, an exciting action scene is displayed on the front with Beorn fighting some orcs. &nbsp;The back showcases all the main features and characters in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions came folded, but not worse than a lot of other sets of this size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>If you&#39;re in the need for dark grey bricks and slopes then this is a set for you. &nbsp;There&#39;s also a good number of the newer mason bricks as well. &nbsp;Probably the highlight for me though as far as parts go (except minifigs) are the two dark red foliage pieces and the bronze colored spikes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gundabad Orcs: &nbsp;</strong>These two are identical except for the weapons and shoulder armour. &nbsp;Like in the films, I love how they characterize and distinguish different types of orcs/goblins. &nbsp;So far we&#39;ve seen LEGO Mordor orcs, Moria orcs, goblins, and Uruk-hai. &nbsp;In this and the Dol Guldur Battle we get Gundabad orcs. &nbsp;By their appearance they seem to be an especially gruesome bunch. &nbsp;Their printing on the torso, legs and head is superb. &nbsp;The heads are not double-faced though. &nbsp;Instead, hair (like on Mordor orcs) is printed on the back so some members of your army can be bald. &nbsp;The shoulder armour included with one looks amazing. &nbsp;It gives the orc quite a nice profile and really makes him look a lot more tough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Beorn: </strong>While there are a lot of different views concerning this shape-shifter&#39;s design in the film I think most people would agree that he looks, well, interesting. &nbsp;His printing on his torso/legs is amazing as ever. &nbsp;His head and hair are actually one piece! &nbsp;I guess that way a standard head piece wouldn&#39;t get stuck inside his &quot;Sonic&quot;-like mohawk. &nbsp;A downside to it though is that he only has one expression. &nbsp;That previously mentioned mohawk runs all the way down his back (like in the film), almost to the torso piece. &nbsp;Whether you like his look in the film or not, you can&#39;t deny that he is quite a neat (and unique) minifigure. &nbsp;Next year I hope we get to see him in bear form!</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>With all the slopes, angles, and spikes, it is actually a fun build, considering it&#39;s one big door. &nbsp;Being part of a ruined fortress really helps, it makes the build unregular. &nbsp;I certainly enjoyed it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The finished model looks and feels very solid, much bigger than you might expect. &nbsp;It looks suitably dark and scary, just like Dol Guldur should. &nbsp;The spikes around the door really add to this effect. &nbsp;The swinging axes and hammer work beautifully and it&#39;s quite amusing to send orcs flying through the air with them! &nbsp;Even in a set like this LEGO managed to include of of those ubiquitous flick-fire missiles. &nbsp;The right side of the model can fold out to reveal one (and a giant white spike). &nbsp;All in all it is a fantastic model that provides a lot of playability and can look good as a display too.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This is a fantastic set for $20. &nbsp;It has useful parts (if you need actual bricks anymore these days), great minifigs, and lots of playability. &nbsp;This would make for a great gift for any Hobbit fan (well, unless they&#39;re a purist). &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I only wonder why Beorn was included. &nbsp;In The Desolation of Smaug he never goes to Dol Guldur. &nbsp;It&#39;s possible he could in the Extended Edition, or perhaps this scene got moved to film three, There and Back Again. &nbsp;I suppose only time will tell... &nbsp;I&#39;m not going to complain though since we haven&#39;t gotten to see him in any other set released so far. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2014-01-09T14:46:07.657Z","Right to bear arms? ","<p>There&#39;s a trend among the smallest licensed sets in a given theme in which we are often invited along for the Minifigs&nbsp;and possibly stay for the set itself. And while I am often reluctant to spread more negativity than necessary around the Internet, I have to say that Dol Goldur Ambush is a pretty dubious entry into asubtheme that already seems to have its unfair share of dubious sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the sets from &quot;<a href=""http://new.brickset.com/sets/theme-The-Hobbit/subtheme-An-Unexpected-Journey"">An Unexpected Journey</a>&quot; seemed to have a curious fixation with trees, then &quot;<a href=""http://new.brickset.com/sets/theme-The-Hobbit/subtheme-The-Desolation-of-Smaug"">The Desolation of Smaug</a>&quot; seems pretty hung up on rocks, or at least rocky formations. And while I do actually enjoy naturalistic builds, there&#39;s something about a retail set that is pretty much a rock formation that leaves a lot to be desired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I mentioned licensed Minifigs in my opening paragraph because I have to say that the three in this set are probably among the most boring I have ever encountered. The unique Minifig here is Beorn, and I suppose I have to confess that I have (a) only dim memories of the novel and (b) not seen the second Hobbit film at the time of writing this, though I do know that Beorn is supposed to be some guy who transforms into a bear. Therefore I ask: where is the bear? I know the big animal moulds&nbsp;are expensive to include into sets but I would much rather have had a bear than the dinky little catapult that we do get, and we did have a very nice bear in Forest Police Station (<a href=""http://new.brickset.com/sets/4440-1/Forest-Police-Station"">4440</a>) that is just around two years old. Otherwise I have to say that there is little visual interest to Beorn&nbsp;otherwise, in spite of the unique head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two Orcs are even more uninteresting, although at least we do get &quot;shoulder armour&quot; and hairpieces to differentiate them from the more generic ones (relatively speaking) that you get an abundance of in Dol Goldur Battle (<a href=""http://new.brickset.com/sets/79014-1/Dol-Guldur-Battle"">79014</a>), which this set is supposed to act as a companion to - more on that later. I guess more generic minions are welcome for battle scenes, but in terms of interest it&#39;s hard to say anything to positive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s two builds here: the aforementioned catapult and the rocky &quot;gateway&quot;. I am generally not a big fan of catapults for the simple reason that they tend to act as mere buffs to a set&#39;s piececount and therefore never have any coherent sense of scale when placed next to each other. I guess they&#39;re fun for kids but I don&#39;t suppose I would know much about that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main build is the rock formation, and it&#39;s kind of hard to say too much about it, really, because it basically is what it is. There&#39;s no doubt that the detailing is attractive, and the swinging swords/hammer are a tried-and-true LEGO gag that have featured prominently in other sets of this nature before. What is a decent bonus, I suppose, is that this set can be joined up to Dol Goldur Battle&#39;s arrangement so it looks much less sad on its own. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite fair to say that this set is fine simply because it can be meshed into a much larger and more impressive one, and on its own, it&#39;s really not that much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>US$20 is a bit steep for three not-altogether-desirable Minifigs&nbsp;and a pair of rather uninteresting builds, and I can guess that only a Hobbit completionist would have any desire at all to pick this up - and in all honesty, I think the inclusion of a &quot;bear form&quot; for Beorn&nbsp;would have given this set a lot more mileage as a standalone. As mentioned, it makes for a decent and coherent pairing with 79014, but, on its own, I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t quite recommend it.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-02-17T21:30:49.31Z","Attachment for a Larger Set","<p><strong>Set # 79011 Dol Guldur Ambush: </strong>It&#39;s been a while since my last review, these sets have been sitting around waiting for me to get on with things and finally I have the opportunity to get this done. For the LEGO Hobbit sets of 2013 and movie 2 we&#39;ve seen a pretty small selection of key scenes from the film. LEGO decided to give us a lot less in numbers, but a lot more in decent army building sets for fans of large scale battles. Let&#39;s move on with my thoughts on this, the cheapest boxed set of the Sub-Theme that is Desolation of Smaug.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is the 24.99$ set, it&#39;s box featues a brand new design which captures the feeling of the film quite nicely. It&#39;s more somber looking and definitely indicative of the darkness that the second film featured more than the light-hearted fun of An Unexpect Journey. I like this new design, it still features the best of what LEGO has to offer, showcasing the features of the set and the Mini-Figures. And it also captures the feeling I had after seeing the second film strongly.</p>

<p>The instructions are good too and they include a checklist of all the Mini-Figs from 2013, including the two from the polybags which is really a first. The back also shows off all three other sets from the Theme so you know what&#39;s out there besides this one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a lot of dark colours, medium stone grey and a few dark red leaves for the trees. Nothing too rare here, although you get 2 of the real brick looking 1x2 bricks. The real draw of this set in my opinion isn&#39;t the parts though, it&#39;s the Mini-Figures and the conectability with Dol Guldur Battle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes three Mini-Figures, all three of which are really richly detailed. I do feel that there is a bit of an minor issue with one of the Mini-Figures, however that&#39;s what we&#39;ll discuss when we get to him.</p>

<p>You get two Gundabad Orcs in this set, they pretty much are identical for detailing and print wise with great double-sided torsos and heads (they only have a single face, but the back of their head includes the same printing Yazneg and other Orcs had from the first group of Hobbit sets.) One is given the ball and chain from Ninjago, which I still don&#39;t like as an accessory for Middle-Earth Orcs, the other is wearing a shoulder armour and carrying the Uruk-Hai sword.</p>

<p>Both Orcs are really great for troop building and I hope this year LEGO introduces a Gundabad Orc Polybag for army building.</p>

<p>The third Mini-Figure is Beorn, Beorn has some great printing and really looks a lot like the character from the film. He&#39;s got a double-sided torso and leg printing as well as a brand new Mini-Figure head sculpt that is a single piece with no hair/hat piece. He&#39;s got a buildable axe as an accessory, unfortunately I think he&#39;s too short. It&#39;s been awhile since I saw the film, however I do believe that Beorn was even taller than Gandalf. This version is just too short, he&#39;s an ordinary sized Mini-Figure when honestly I think it should have been a double-sized Mini-Fig, twice as tall as regular Mini-Figures.</p>

<p>Everything about him is great, I just think he needed to be taller.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There isn&#39;t much to this build, it doesn&#39;t come in numbered bags, instead it&#39;s one of those seperate the pieces by colour before building kind of sets. I like how it looks, it&#39;s just if you don&#39;t have Dol Guldur Battle it is a bit lacking in scale and displayability.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fun and fast build though that isn&#39;t too complicated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a small archway/entrance to the old fortress that the Orcs have set some traps to kill invaders intending to rescue Gandalf. I think the model is a bit weaker compared to Uruk-Hai Army, at least with the UHA set you had places to put the Mini-Figures who are defending Helm&#39;s Deep. Here there&#39;s no place to put the Orcs on the battlements, because there are no battlements.</p>

<p>As far as play features go this one is perhaps loaded down with too many, you have a seperate catapult micro-build that launches two cylinder pieces at once. One side of the entrance has a swinging attachment with twin axes to slay any intruders. The other has a much larger almost stone looking axe/hammer combination which looks very heavy and deadly. Then there is the worst aspect of this set. You&#39;ve got a swing open hideaway that has a flick-fire missile.</p>

<p>Really, flick-fire missiles on Dol Guldur? I understand how LEGO wants to make things fun for adult and children alike, however having a flick-fire missile in a medieval setting just doesn&#39;t work at all. Sorry LEGO I think it would have been better if it was just an empty hiding spot for the Orc instead of a flick-fire launcher. At least then you could put one of the Orcs actually on the model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say this is a great set for collectors intending to get Dol Guldur Battle to attach it to for display, it&#39;s still a good looking set by itself, I just wish that the main build had a place for the Orcs to hang out and hide before attacking. I think Beorn should have been larger as well. Recommended for fans, completists and Mini-Figure lovers, if you&#39;re not buying Dol Guldur Battle for whatever reason there isn&#39;t much this set has to offer.</p>

"lkb57","2014-05-01T07:08:57.433Z","Great Minifigs, but not a stand alone set","<p>I was excited to get my hands on this set, mainly because it contains Beorn (and the Gundabad Orcs were a happy addition too), and I definitely wasn&#39;t disappointed in that regard. Beorn is a great minifig&nbsp;and a must-have addition to my collection. I do have one complaint about him, but I&#39;ll explain that later on. The set itself is fun, but I feel like you pretty much have to buy <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79014-1/Dol-Guldur-Battle"">79014</a>, which is a $70 set (and for that reason I haven&#39;t got it yet) to get the maximum enjoyment out of Dol Guldur Ambush.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are a mixed bag. If you&#39;re a castle or LOTR/Hobbit MOC-er, the pieces abundant gray pieces will be incredibly useful. Heck, you could even get a lot of mileage out of them if you&#39;re a Star Wars builder. Otherwise, the pieces may seem fairly &quot;bleh&quot; to you. A whole lot of gray. But the autumn-colored leaves and vines are certainly appreciated, as are the cool rust-colored blades that line the doorway. I personally was very excited to get more castle-building bricks, but for the Lego builder who&#39;s interests lie elsewhere, the pieces will likely not excite.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I feel like I end up saying this a lot, but &quot;as usual&quot; the minifigures are excellent. I was surprised to find that Beorn&#39;s head and hair are all one piece, so he does not come with two different expressions; however, his torso is printed front and back, mimicking the woven robe he wear sin the movie, and the printing continues down his legs. Overall, I was really pleased by Beorn . . . however, I do secretly wish that the designers had made him much larger, since in the movie, he is several feet taller than Gandalf. For example, they could have build a Beorn minifigure similar to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/hp061/Hagrid-Reddish-Brown-Topcoat-(Light-Flesh-Version-with-Moveable-Hands)"">Hagrid minifig</a> from the Harry Potter theme. Not identical, mind you, but along the same lines to really accentuate his size.</p>

<p>The two Gundabad Orcs are fun because they are yet another orc variant that will give more flavor to any evil army. They both have two expressions (angry and &nbsp;. . . angrier), but since there&#39;s two minifigs, you usually end up seeing both expressions, unless you want them to look identical. One of the orcs comes with spikey shoulder armor that looks pretty darn sweet.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The finished model looks really good, and does a great job of capturing the feel of the ruins of Dol Guldur as seen in the movie; however, as with playability, the look of the set just doesn&#39;t feel complete until you&#39;ve attached it to&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79014-1/Dol-Guldur-Battle"" style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">79014</a>. Despite it&#39;s small size, the set includes enough playability (two booby-trap weapons that swing out through the open doorway . . . apparently the orcs don&#39;t like house guests) to be fun, but as I mentioned above, it really needs to be paired with the larger Dol Guldur&nbsp;set to reach it&#39;s full potential.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a LOTR/Hobbit collector, this set is a must-have, since currently it&#39;s the only way to get your hands on Beorn. If you&#39;re a more generic castle collector, I&#39;d still grab this set because it comes with a load of castle-related bricks, great vegetation pieces, and quite a few minifig accessories (weapons, armor, etc.) that will come in useful. A more general collector would probably be wise to save her pennies for a less &quot;niche&quot; set.</p>

<p>But what can I say? I love LOTR and the Hobbit, and in the end, this set was a ton of fun. I&#39;m glad I got it.</p>

"Arceusrox","2014-03-12T17:27:49.34Z","Elvish Orcs","<p>Dol Guldur&nbsp;Ambush is the smallest set in the new Hobbit line, since there is no $12 one this time. But for a small set, there&#39;s a lot in here, like three cool minifigures and some great parts with tons of playability.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are pretty good, like the wheels on the catapult and this new piece I haven&#39;t seen before, which is round and has a hole in the middle. I also like the pieces used on the tree.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All of the minifigs&nbsp;are exclusive to this set, if you count the hair making the orcs different. Beorn looks great, and I love his head/hair piece. It would&#39;ve been nice to see the hair on other minifigs, but that probably would&#39;ve been hard to make as a part. He holds the same axe seen in lots of other&nbsp;sets. The Gundabad&nbsp;Orcs&nbsp;are cool too. One has a cool looking shoulder armor piece, and they both have hair with ears on them, which looks a little strange. Why would an Orc&nbsp;have Elf ears?One&nbsp;Orc has a new sword, and the other has a ball and chain.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun, and it was cool seeing the whole thing come together. I always like building Lego sets though, so I have nothing bad to say about my building experience.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s actually bigger than it looks when finished, and I like it a lot. It has lots of playability and lots of play features. I&#39;m a little annoyed at the fact that there&#39;s and extra flickfire, 1x1 brick, and two skulls with no place to go. They just sit next to the set. Also, the torch seems a little out of place. But other than that, it looks very nice and it&#39;s very fun to play with.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For $20, this set has a lot to offer. 217 pieces is only&nbsp;about 40 less than the Council of Elrond, and it comes with only one less minifig. Beorn is also nice to have if you&#39;re a fan of the Hobbit. Buy this if you can, especially if you already have Dol&nbsp;Guldur&nbsp;Battle, since they attach to each other.&nbsp;</p>
",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"alfred_the_buttler","2019-10-20T05:09:49.05Z","Good small set, but others are better, get it for Beorn ","<p>So there is one reason why you should get this set, and that is Beorn, it&#39;s the only place you can find him and he is in his human form, he isn&#39;t available as a bear, but Lego does make bears if you feel you need one.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>the set itself is small but rather fun. However, when compared to similarly sized sets (and even smaller ones) the location just seems less important and of course Dol Guldor is represented in a much larger set. This simply tacks onto the larger set and it seems to only exist because they wanted you to pay extra for Beorn. Of course, I don&#39;t own the larger set so I&#39;m happy to have this cheap one.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>Yes, you got this set for Beorn and he is incredibly well detailed. His head and hair is a single piece, like many Star Wars aliens. However, I thought his head was stuck in his hair when I first saw it because it really does resemble a Lego head with a large hair piece. I believe he is the only LOTR minifigure like this which makes him unique. My only complaint is while his head and hair make him large, he isn&#39;t as tall as Gandalf with a hat, so I really wish that they would have made his body larger, or better yet, make him a big fig. The other 2 minifigures are orcs and as usual look great. I&#39;m not sure if they are unique to this set, but they look like just about any other orc from The Hobbit sets so I don&#39;t think they are unique. However always good to build up your orc army, after all, Aragon can slice through 50 of them in a minute.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Model</b></p>

<p>The build is not symmetrical which keeps it interesting, although there aren&#39;t really any interesting techniques, and no SNOT. Even the play features are incredibly simple and nothing that I couldn&#39;t build as a kid with my Classic Space sets. It&#39;s still fun however, and since it is small and fast I can&#39;t complain.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model itself is just a doorway. It looks nice, but it&#39;s so small that it simply isn&#39;t all that interesting. It&#39;s saving grace is it&#39;s play features. On either side of the doorways are weapons that swing out. One side features to axe (which aren&#39;t really strong enough to knock over a minifigure), and the other is a giant hammer that works incredibly well. I don&#39;t really think these booby traps are entirely appropriate for LOTR, but they are fun, and if you have some Indiana Jones sets, this would be great for trying to get the holy grail.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>A small section of the rocks on the right side of this set swing out on a hinge revealing a white sharp thing (I can&#39;t call it a tooth) and a flick fire missile. I really don&#39;t get this part of the set. Are the rocks alive and supposed to eat you? And do you really need another play feature that the set required flick fire missiles? When closed this area looks great, but when opened it looks pretty awful and only offers an inappropriate and not so great play feature. I just wish this portion of the set was static. Oh well, you don&#39;t need to open it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>This is a nice set. Do you need it? I would say you only need this if you want Beorn&nbsp;or are trying to complete the LOTR collection. If you do want Beorn I highly recommend this set because it doesn&#39;t cost much more than buying the minifigure&nbsp;separately, plus you get two orcs. I picked up this set for $20 (including shipping) on Bricklink, so it is very affordable.&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-08T18:31:02.277Z","Not bad for $20","<p>This set was a the only way to get the exclusive minifigure of Beorn. It connects to the larger set Dol Guldur Battle 79014, to make one larger fortress of Dol Guldur. This set also has 2 nice throw in Gundabad Orcs which are a nice enemy for Beorn to fight. There is a lot of playability in this set with the catapult and the traps that are hidden inside the crumbling wall. If you don&#39;t like the build you can always part it out since there are good pieces that can be used to build a mountain. Overall I would suggest this set to someone who owns the Dol Guldur set but doesn&#39;t own this set. I wouldn&#39;t recommend just getting this set.</p>
