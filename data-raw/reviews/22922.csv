I bought this one seeing the minifigs and the Warg.&nbsp;</p><p>Minifigs: First I will begin with the Mirkwood Elf &nbsp;He has a hard plastic hair colored brown with ears on the side and braids down the back. His body is the same as the two archers. A brown and green odd outfit of some sort with all sorts of buttons and stuff. His face and every thing else is the same as the archers except for the hair. He comes with a dagger of time used brilliantly as a elvish knife which I got an extra of. The archers are nice cause you get two of them and if you wanted &nbsp;you could buy extras of this and use it as a battle pack for Gundabad Orcs and elves. The archers get a special bow which is longer than the regular bows and arrows in a bag on their backs. They also have a dark green hood. I could see the hood being used to make a custom Green arrow. As for the rest of the archers nothing else is special. Next we have Thranduil. I don't know who he is I think he is the Mirkwood elven king but I am not sure. He has a rubber hair piece which can be found in a plastic stretchy bag which I find irritatingly hard to open. It has a sort of crown type of thing on it and is blonde with pointy ears on the side. He has a dark red cape which is impossible not to ruin with the hair unfortunately. He has a double sided face one strait faced and the other battle ready. He has a golden sparkled robe on with gray pants. He carries a sword nothing special about it. Next we have the two Gundabad Orcs. They are both the same just one has a spear and spiked shoulder pads while the other is just plain with a large sword with cracks in it. They wear tank top with spikes and bones. They also have on a loin cloth and both have no hair or helmets. They both have marvelous printing of hair on the back and are a tan orange. Their eyes are orange their mouth is &nbsp;has sharp teeth gritted together and white face paint on.&nbsp;</p><p>The creature: The Warg looked like a hyena from the lion king till you put an Orc on him. He is brown and has an open and close able mouth. You move his head up and down and place an orc on him if you like. He also comes with a saddle</p><p>The build: The build is excellent. It teaches a way to make tree's and awesome weapon holders. I love the clever use of the microfig as a small statue. And the ladder is also quite clever. The tree has a barrel with two jewels inside it.</p><p>Playability: This is not very good at all it has a flick fire missile (groan) and a catapult just like the thousands of other tree like sets (groan)&nbsp;</p><p>Value for money: Decent I mean you get a cheap Warg and some Mirkwood Elves and Orcs. The piece count is 276 which is ok for a 30 dollar set.&nbsp;</p><p>Pros: Cheap Warg, Six Minifigures and a cool tree fort thing with a special ladder.</p><p>Cons: An awful unoriginal play playability.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall pretty good set only one con&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,5,5,2,5
"Harmonious_Building","2013-12-25T09:57:04.93Z","Over the Mirkwood wall. ","As far as ""battle packs"" go, the Mirkwood Elf Army certainly stands out as one of the more elaborate examples of such a phenomenon in recent years. At US$30, this set certainly touches the upper bound of what might considered acceptable as something that one might buy repeats of in order to bolster a fledgling plastic fighting force, and LOTR/Hobbit fans especially will surely welcome the inclusion of generic ""good guys"" and especially generic Elves, which have thus far been sorely lacking within the LEGO universe.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>With such a price point, LEGO finds that they can be unusually generous, and there's a lot of stuff to like from this set. Arguably the most exclusive selling point here is the inclusion of the majestic Thranduil, whose foppish magnificence has inspired a <a href=""http://thranduilings.tumblr.com/"">minor memetic following</a>. His tiny plastic incarnation looks great, and he pairs up very nicely with Elrond and the other dudes from the ""original trilogy"" sets. Accompanying him are a handful of Elves that are varied enough to be interesting and can also work with Helm's Deep if one is so inclined; all we need now are a couple of generic humans and we'll be set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Orcs find themselves severely outnumbered in this set, but they do bring a brown Warg to the party, and Wargs are always cool in my book so it's sweet that you get one here. What's odd to me, though, is that LEGO has made exactly one Warg of each of three colours in sets so far, so unless you buy doubles of this or Attack of the Wargs (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=79002-1"">79002</a>), you're going to end up with quite the palette of fell beasts. I'm all for variety, I guess, but it seems a bit weird that the Wargs can't decide what colour they want to be.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now, just about every LEGO set in existence is bound to suffer from scaling issues to some degree, so complaining about something like scale seems like a rather petty thing to do, especially when the fort included with this set is rather nicely detailed and has a handful of cool features and additions. I have to say, though, that the price point really caused the fort to suffer here. If you take a careful look at the picture, you can tell that the ""wall"" is no more than four bricks high, which makes this fort nothing more than a rudimentary garden fence, especially if Wargs are involved. Basically, it's short, and this shortness is very noticeable once it's built, and I'm sorry to say that this compromises both its display value and its playability, which is a shame.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>However, much like Battle at the Black Gate (<a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=79007-1"">79007</a>), LEGO very much desires that you spend more of your hard-earned money and get multiple copies of this set, ostensibly so that you can join them together and make a Hadrian's Wall of sorts across your living room. If you decide to pick up more than one of these - which is somewhat worth it for the Elves, Orcs, and Wargs - I would recommend attempting to raise the overall height of the fort by at least two bricks, which was fairly easy to do even for an untalented rube like myself. The overall fort looks much more pleasing when raised up, and the spare parts are always useful. (And you can always try and flog the spare Thranduil to make some money back.)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Mirkwood Elf Army is a pretty serviceable battle pack that brings a lot as an ""add on"" set, though, on its own merits, I have to say that I find it somewhat lacking. Additional copies will undoubtedly go a long way in terms of improving its overall aesthetics and longevity, which you may end up doing anyway if only for the Minifigs.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2014-03-06T01:07:10.283Z","Build an army for Mirkwood","<p><strong>Set #79012 Mirkwood Elf Army:</strong> LEGO did a great job with the four sets for Desolation of Smaug, this works great as a troop builder set featuring five nameless characters and only one named character from the films. It also works as a decent playset, buying more than one of them allows you to connect them via the modular design. The other aspects of this set we&#39;ll discuss in greater deatil in the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is standard fare from LEGO for The Hobbit line and looks great showing off all of the features in the set and the Mini-Figures. At this point I&#39;m kind of running out of things to say about these boxes honestly, they look and work great.</p>

<p>The instructions are the same as always showing each step-by-step part of the build, there are of course the usual cross-promotions and minifigure checklists. I believe that&#39;s really all that can be said by this point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a lot of tan, dark green and brown pieces that are fairly standard in design, nothing stands out as too rare, however they are great for MOCing. The Warg is a great addition too as it is brown, a new colour for the piece which works&nbsp;awesome next to the white and grey one we&#39;ve gotten in the Attack of the Warg set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has a great Mini-Figure collection for the price range (Six in total), you get two Gundabad Orcs, Three Mirkwood Elves and King Thranduil (Legolas&#39; Father).</p>

<p>The Orcs are not new, their printing is still as impressive as ever. One of them has a spear and shoulder armour, he rides the Warg into battle. The other unfortunately is using the large scimitar accessory for his weapon, it doesn&#39;t impress me as an Orc weapon, however I undestand why LEGO chose to use it instead of introducing another new accessory.</p>

<p>All three elves share the same prints, in fact they also all seem to share all the same expressions and double-sided torso. The only difference is the head piece and the accessories, two of them are wearing green hood pieces and carrying the longbow piece, they also have quivers. The third has two daggers similar to Tauriel from the Mirkwood Spider set and has the Elf hair in brown. Overall perfect for building an army, these three and the two Orcs are all generic. Their printing is great and for the most part their accessories all work, you could easily build a small army by picking up three or more of this set.</p>

<p>Thranduil is the only Mini-Figure who isn&#39;t generic, he includes a nice double-sided torso and legs with great printing to match the costume from the film. He&#39;s also got a dark red cape, which is a nice colour and an awesome looking sculpted hair piece that captures the look of his hair and crown from the film. It&#39;s made from a softer plastic so they can fit over the cape without causing any problems. For accessories he has a sword.</p>

<p>There are also two elven shields in this set for accessories as part of the build, or you can give them to the Mini-Figs to defend against the Orcs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for this set involves two numbered bags and two steps, the first is the large central tree section of the model, which features a Mini-Figure launching mechanism. The second bag features the smaller section of the wall, which can be repetitive. However once it&#39;s all put together it looks great and the build is fairly satisfying, though I will admit to a bit of dissapointment that it does not match up completely with the Barrel Escape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model looks stunning and is loads of fun, even if it is a bit on the short side. It&#39;s a little small for a wall to protect the elves from the invading Orcs, nothing like Helm&#39;s Deep, which I suppose is the better design choice for the size and price of this set. It&#39;s design is modular, meaning that you can attach the wall and the weapon storage area on either side, or if you have more than one you can combine the wall to make a much larger one as the instructons indicate.</p>

<p>The launching gimmick to send an Elf flying to attack an Orc is really fun and works quite nicely for this kind of set, I found the play feature to actually be loads of fun compared to other sets. The only problem I have with the set is the use of flick-fire missiles. Honestly a catapult would make a lot more sense, missiles are just not something you typically see in medieval times.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this set is a great set for the price and the mini-figures are really impressive, the inclusion of a Warg in brown and the fact that the cost is only 35$ means it&#39;s priced perfectly for buying multiples and building your Mirkwood Elf Army, plus a small legion of Gundabad Orcs and Wargs. Highly Recommended.</p>

"Telcontar","2014-01-21T00:16:10.263Z","Orcs in Mirkwood","<p>Intros are so overrated sometimes (especially when you have writer&#39;s block). &nbsp;So instead of wasting time let&#39;s get on to the review shall we?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box leaves little extra room inside, which is consistent with the past trend of smaller, more compact boxes. &nbsp;The front shows an engaging action scene and the back displays the key features, parts, and characters. &nbsp;The instructions a easy to follow, except for a fold. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family:arvo-fs,rockwell,courier,sans-serif; font-size:20px; letter-spacing:-0.75px"">Parts</span></p>

<p>If you&#39;re in the need for brown and tan bricks then this set is for you. &nbsp;It&#39;s nice to actually see real bricks in a set these days with all the specialized parts (which isn&#39;t always a bad thing mind you). &nbsp;The bit of green and olive green foliage is very nice for MOCs. &nbsp;The real highlight of this set though are the minifigs and the fantastic warg. &nbsp;A mention should also be give to the new elven shields that are mounted on the wall though. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s a new element, but the design is certainly new, and very well done. &nbsp;They look incredible and add a lot of detail to the finished model (or the elvf&nbsp;guards).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Gundabad&nbsp;Orcs:&nbsp;</strong>These are a new breed of orcs yet unseen in previous waves. &nbsp;They come from Mount Gundabad&nbsp;at the northern end of the Misty Mountains &nbsp;If I had to compare them to a type of orc seen thus far in LEGO form I&#39;d say they are most like Mordor orcs. &nbsp;But they are still quite unique and distinct. &nbsp;The main feature that makes them this way is the orange colored tone of their skin. &nbsp;Their printing on the legs, torso (front and back), and head is extremely detailed. &nbsp;Their heads are identical and have a little bit of hair printed on the back side (like the Mordor&nbsp;orcs). &nbsp;One comes with a new shoulder armor piece that looks terrific. &nbsp;It adds a lot of character and gives the minifigure quite a stunning profile.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Generic&quot;&nbsp;Mirkwood Elves: &nbsp;</strong>While these guys depict &quot;normal&quot; elves from the Woodland Realm they are far from normal minifigures! &nbsp;Let me start by saying that their legs, torsos, and double sided heads are all identical. &nbsp;The printing on all (especially the torsos and legs) is exquisite. &nbsp;By looking at it you can tell that Legolas and Tauriel have been to the same tailer. &nbsp;(In other words, you can tell that these elves belong together which is what the wardrobe and art department intended on these Hobbit films.) &nbsp;Two of the elves come with dark green hoods, bows, and quivers while the third comes with a &quot;normal&quot; brown elf hair and a dagger (which is the same piece as the one Tauriel uses FYI). &nbsp;Even though they are excellent minifigs&nbsp;and ones I enjoy owning, I still hope to see some armored elves like the ones seen in the film.</p>

<p><strong>Thranduil:</strong> The Elven&nbsp;King is by far the most impressive minifig included with this set. &nbsp;His torso/leg printing is astounding. &nbsp;The detailing is simply impressive. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been amazed with the minifig quality presented in the LotR and Hobbit themes so far and this guy certainly lives up to that high standard. &nbsp;He comes with a red cape and a unique hair/crown piece which is slightly rubbery. &nbsp;His double-sided face (neutral/angry) captures the look of the character from the film quite nicely (I&#39;m mainly referring to the large eyebrows). &nbsp;The only thing that could be slightly disappointing is that he comes with a regular broad-sword piece. &nbsp;One last note, he was never present at this particular battle in the film (at least in the theatrical cut), but I&#39;m not going to complain since I don&#39;t think we would&#39;ve gotten him any other way!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The set basically consists of a wall and a tree. &nbsp;If it was simply that it would be awfully boring. &nbsp;Thankfully, it isn&#39;t. &nbsp;&quot;Hinge&quot; bricks are used to separate the wall into three sections and the tree which is growing through the wall. &nbsp;These two main features help make the build much more interesting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I have to admit, when pictures first came out I was horrified. &nbsp;It looked awful! &nbsp;Now after owning it though the whole structure has grown on me tremendously. &nbsp;As far as play features go there are two of them. &nbsp;First, the ever-present flick-fire missile makes an appearance again. &nbsp;This time it&#39;s in the center of the wall. &nbsp;Flick-fire missiles aren&#39;t bad, but I feel like they&#39;re overused a bit. &nbsp;A little more ingenuity would be nice to see. &nbsp;Second, the catapult at the top of the tree. &nbsp;Unless you know it&#39;s there it is easily to overlook because it is so well hidden. &nbsp;When you launch a minifig&nbsp;the catapult pushes one of the branches up and to the side just in time to give the impression that the elf is jumping out of the tree. &nbsp;It&#39;s a simple feature that&#39;s been embellished and improved upon that works wonderfully. &nbsp;It&#39;s one of the best play features I&#39;ve seen in a long time. &nbsp;Plus, the whole top platform of the tree can rotate so you can launch your elf any direction. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A little weapons rack is also included that holds an extra dagger and bow. &nbsp;It also has a grey micro-statue in it as well which is always a nice touch. &nbsp;For the orcs a ladder is provided along with a new brown warg. &nbsp;It is exactly like the wargs seen last year in Attack of the Wargs&nbsp;except in &nbsp;regard to its color. &nbsp;This one is brown, something we have not seen before. &nbsp;I have to say it looks fantastic. &nbsp;It is certainly a must for anyone&#39;s orc army whether it be from LotR, the Hobbit, or any other period of history in Middle-earth.</p>

<p>Despite it&#39;s many great features the wall still feels a bit too short to me. &nbsp;Adding a few more bricks to it would be a great improvement. &nbsp;If they couldn&#39;t make it taller I wish the designers could&#39;ve added a gate like the one seen in the film. &nbsp;Oh well. &nbsp;I guess it will be another fun challenge to expand it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set that packs in a lot of playability, especially for Hobbit fans whether they&#39;re Middle-earth fanatics or casual movie-goers. &nbsp;(Well, this scene is never described in the book so for strict purists a different one would probably be better. ;-) ) &nbsp;It is priced a little high for people who like battle packs, or for those who were hoping for a slightly bigger structure. &nbsp;But despite&nbsp;these few flaws I would still certainly recommend it.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-09-20T07:17:46.593Z","Just a Battle Pack","<p>Of the 13 LOTR sets I own, this is certainly the weakest. I picked it up for $6 without the minifigures, and despite its large size in comparison to Star Wars battle packs, that $6 is all this set is worth. Now if you were to get all the minifigures&nbsp;then it would be a good value as it allows you to easily build up two armies which is typically a very expensive thing to do with LOTR. Plus you get a warg!</p>

<p><b>The Warg</b></p>

<p>While I didn&rsquo;t get the minifigures, I did get the warg and it looks amazing. Very believable, and the brown is a much better color than the white and gray that came in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79002-1/Attack-of-the-Wargs"">Attack of the Wargs</a>. The jaw is removable and therefore can open and close. And the head also moves up and down, but unlike my horses from the 80&rsquo;s, the saddle (which can be replaced with bricks) doesn&rsquo;t get in the heads way. I think Lego did a fantastic job designing this piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Model</b></p>

<p>Like all other LOTR sets it is asymmetrical, and despite having three wall panels, each is unique which keeps the build interesting. Like many other LOTR sets, it uses a modular design so that multiples of this set can be combined together, and given its price and collection of minifigures, it is realistic that you may actually purchase 2 sets. It does come with a nice selection of bricks, especially if you like trees. However Lego created this set as a long build and I feel this set would have benefited more from height than it does from length. &nbsp;This especially true if you were to combine two sets which would result in an absurdly long wall but two little baby trees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set does have one very nice play feature, and that is the catapult that also knocks over a tree as it launches your minifigure. The effect is great, however very inaccurate. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine elves ever destroying a tree, even if they were in battle. Destruction of trees of course is orc terrain. Other than that you have a flick fire arrow, but I&rsquo;ve never enjoyed these, and a ladder for the orcs to climb the wall with.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I feel that this set is better as a collection of parts than it is as a model. And certainly the catapult could be repurposed, perhaps as an addition to the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9476-1/The-Orc-Forge"">Orc Forge</a>. Of course the real value of this set is in the minifigures and the warg. Smaller sets such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79000-1/Riddles-for-the-Ring"">Riddle for the Ring</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79005-1/The-Wizard-Battle"">Wizard Battle</a> have much better builds and models than this much larger set.&nbsp;</p>
