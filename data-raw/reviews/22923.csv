"Sebastian","2013-11-24T07:07:51.967Z","Cosy, mid-sized set, good for display","<p>This was the 2013 the Hobbit set I had been anticipating the most. The setup of Lake Town that we get here is not accurate to the book whatsoever as it refers to the movie for which&nbsp;Tolkien's original storyline was changed massively. So there is another prison cell and a couple of catapults. This aside, the set is really nice and it&nbsp;delivers a trace of romanticism an rustic charm: Paraffin lamps hang from the ship's mast and balcony and the set is built with an assortment of warm colours and some remnants of snow set the tone of the season. Also, the dark red columns in front of the entrance are a nice touch. I was surprised to see another oil lamp in the first storey of the main buildung&nbsp;embellished with pearl-gold 1x1 round plates. One of those little details I like&nbsp;Lego for. Moreover, some dark green is mixed in the build to represent the withered look of Lake Town as it is situated in the middle of a lake!</p><p>The set includes five figures: Bilbo, a newly-outfitted Thorin Oakenshield, dragon-slayer Bard the Bowman, a Lake Town guard and finally the Master of Lake Town, the latter two being my favourites of the line-up because of their colourful clothing.</p><p>The play functions aren't that special: the prison bars can be pushed out and the wall of the guard house can be turned upwards by using a knob. I think this is a display piece anyway, just for looks and enjoyment. I like it a lot and it has already found a place in my personal collector's hall of fame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,3,4
"Telcontar","2014-03-11T05:50:43.9Z","You'd Have To Be Buried In Fish To Not Like This Set...","<p>Well, if you did have such an unfortunate experience I doubt you&#39;ll be in a mood to like anything for a while. &nbsp;So if you haven&#39;t been under some smelly seafood lately should you still consider buying this set? &nbsp;Well, you&#39;ll have to make that decision for yourself, but let me share my thoughts with you first... &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: Arvo-FS, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>Like nearly all LEGO sets the front displays a vivid action scene. &nbsp;In this case Bilbo (who has just escaped&nbsp;from jail) and Thorin are sailing away from the Master and his Guard while Bard looks on. &nbsp;What&#39;s interesting though is that the scene depicted is not accurate to the film (or book) at all. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know if this was a result of script changes or simply miscommunication (which seems the more likely explanation in this instance). &nbsp; I&#39;ll try to not reveal much though more for people who have yet to see the film.</p>

<p>The instructions came slightly folded but it didn&#39;t really hinder the building process. &nbsp;A heavy paper weight wouldn&#39;t be a bad idea though (besides for the fact that you would have to flip the pages every few moments).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>If you don&#39;t need brown bricks or &quot;earthy&quot; colors then the parts rating would be much lower for you. &nbsp;For others like myself though (who like to build more &quot;natural&quot; objects, castles, forts, etc.) they are highly valued. &nbsp;As seen in the pictures, there are obviously many brown bricks and plates. &nbsp;There are also a fair amount of dark green bricks as well (20 1x1 bricks) which are mostly used as accents. &nbsp;Dark green pennants are always nice plus you can&#39;t overlook the One Ring or the two lifeboats that make up the boat. &nbsp;Speaking of the boat, two round shields are hung on either side with printed fish motifs on them. &nbsp;Well, if you look closer you&#39;ll notice that they look much more like humpback whales which is a little odd. &nbsp;People who like to build jails for all their City robbers will like this set too considering 8 1x4x2&nbsp;black jail bars are included.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Bilbo Baggins:&nbsp;</strong>He is the only character included that is not exclusive to this set. &nbsp;Well, that&#39;s not entirely true since the guard did get his own polybag, but nevertheless he is probably the most &#39;boring&#39;. &nbsp;I would have really liked to see him dressed in his blue coat that he wears toward the end of the Company&#39;s stay in Lake-town (the one he meets Smaug in).</p>

<p><strong>Thorin Oakenshield: </strong>Compared to the regal&nbsp;Thorin&nbsp;that came in the Warg set last year, this one looks much more &#39;worn out&#39; as it were. &nbsp;I mean, you can tell from his torso printing that he&#39;s been through some rough times lately (which is indeed the case). &nbsp;His double-sided head, legs and flowing hair aren&#39;t new, but his torso is. &nbsp;It&#39;s a much simpler design, just some folds in his blue under-shirt and a brown belt. &nbsp;Similar designs carry over to the back. &nbsp;Not as exciting perhaps as some of the other figs, but very accurate and very important.</p>

<p><strong>Bard the Bowman:&nbsp;</strong>Or should I say &quot;Barge-man&quot;? &nbsp;Or even &quot;Brick-man&quot;? &nbsp;OK, OK, I&#39;ll stop... Bard definitely&nbsp;looks the part. &nbsp;Unlike my poor attempt at humor in the opening Bard is much more of a serious character. &nbsp;His &quot;scruffy&quot; coat is nicely printed on the torso and the design carries down to the legs. &nbsp;The back of the torso just has some simple folds on it. &nbsp;His double-sided face (neutral-angry) is beautifully done and conveys so much depth and character for a minifigure. &nbsp;His hair piece appears to be a recycled part from Qui-gon Jinn, but in black. &nbsp;It suits him well. &nbsp;Bard comes armed with a long-bow (like the ones the elves carry in other sets).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Lake-town Guard:&nbsp;</strong>This is an absolutely stunning minifigure. &nbsp;The level of detailing on the torso and legs is incredible. &nbsp;The only negative aspect is that his bearded head only comes one-sided. &nbsp;For those that don&#39;t like the fish hat, take it up with the film.</p>

<p><strong>Master of Lake-town:&nbsp;</strong>If the Guard was stunning then the Master takes it up to a whole new level. &nbsp;The printing is even more intricate and beautiful to behold on the torso (front/back) and legs. &nbsp;The double-sided head captures the character of the Master wonderfully. &nbsp;Top it all off with an exquisite fur-lined hat and a double-sided cape (purple/red) and he looks just like the greedy, opulent, self-serving politician we all know and love. :-) &nbsp;He is definitely one of the most exquisite minifigs to come out the Middle-earth themes so far (and that&#39;s sayin&#39; a lot!).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Because the instructions break down the model to such simplistic&nbsp;levels the build is not hard at all. &nbsp;The most difficult aspect was tying the string on the boat. &nbsp;That&#39;s one part where a parent may have to help a younger child. &nbsp;There are also three stickers which are included. &nbsp;The first, which goes on the sign post, is somewhat necessary but the other two (which serve as wood decals on one side of the building) are not. &nbsp;None of them are hard to apply though so they shouldn&#39;t be too much trouble. &nbsp;Because the three main parts of the set are all quite different from each other (yes, even the buildings) it keeps the build fresh and interesting. &nbsp;It also makes it easy to just build one small part at a time.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Like so many sets based on the vast world of Middle-earth, this is only a small part of Lake-town. &nbsp;With that said, let me begin with the boat. &nbsp;Compared to the film it is way to narrow. &nbsp;Only a few dwarves could fit at best and good luck with 13+ barrels! &nbsp;But for only the minifigs included in the set itself it works fine. &nbsp;The catapult is simply added for play value&#39;s sake. &nbsp;If you want to fully re-create the scene consider building a new barge. &nbsp;Despite these few flaws it really does look like a nice boat. &nbsp;It&#39;s not only long but it&#39;s extremely tall (thanks to its mast), much more so than the buildings. &nbsp;I love the SNOT technique used to build the sail. &nbsp;Despite difficulties tying it, the string sells the model and ties everything together (pun intended).</p>

<p>The smaller building features a weapons rack and a secret passage. &nbsp;The removable rack holds three accessories, a chain mace, broadsword, and a short sword. &nbsp;The secret passage is accessed by turning a nob on the side of the building that lifts up part of the wall. &nbsp;Both buildings include some nice snow accents (studs, sloped plates, and cheese slopes) which really add to the atmosphere and feel of the set.</p>

<p>The larger building features a jail cell, a small room upstairs, and an open platform on the roof with a catapult. &nbsp;The cell is big enough to comfortably fit one minifig. &nbsp;The function on the back which springs open the jail works quite well. &nbsp;The upstairs room features a single lamp and some nice, gold-latticed windows. &nbsp;Like the first buildings, snow accents are a big part of the look. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I suppose there aren&#39;t as many &quot;play features&quot; in this set compared to others of similar size, but between the plentiful and diverse characters, boat, simple but effective catapults and jail I see a lot of play potential. &nbsp;Some complain about the lack of large blue baseplates but I think it looks better without one to be honest. &nbsp;It would constrict the structures to a set position which would severely limit playability and it would be more difficult to arrange for display.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is definitely one of the stronger Hobbit sets released so far. &nbsp;It&#39;s hard to pinpoint one particular element that makes it that way, but sometimes it&#39;s just more of a feeling or a combination of so many things done right. &nbsp;The wonderful minifigs, almost &quot;quaint&quot; buildings, and not to mention stunning boat all make for a fantastic set that is lot of fun, good for display, and well worth your money.</p>

"HikerCZ","2014-08-27T13:32:35.26Z","There are two sides to every story ","<p>I was extremely&nbsp;looking forward to this set, adverts in the cinema were pretty cool and inviting. So when the right moment came (in my case a very good price, which was about 30 Euros - that&#39;s a bargain in my book), I went for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, based on the pictures&nbsp;I was extremely intrigued by the boat. And that became&nbsp;also the source of my greatest disappointment - unfortunately&nbsp;you won&#39;t be able to see from the promotional pictures that the boat consists of two smaller boats and is&nbsp;not a single hull space. It is quite&nbsp;cleverly concealed but not enough.&nbsp;It is slightly baffling&nbsp;with so&nbsp;many unique molds of various larger&nbsp;vessels how much it would cost to create a small boat mold for a licensed (read a more expensive) set. It almost seems that the designers and developers worked half-heartedly on the boat. And I have to say not just the boat...</p>

<p>Apart from the boat, you get two structures, one is basically a very simple side street something (I have no idea what it should represent) and a prison. Even though, the prison building is nice, there are not many features inside. I was so unhappy with the final outcome, I immediately had to disintegrate the set and build my own version&nbsp;comprising&nbsp;both structures. Which was surprisingly easy&nbsp;- there many modding&nbsp;options with this set. At the moment I&#39;m using the modded&nbsp;(and in my opinion much nicer)&nbsp;building in my medieval town as a prison. So this a fairly good aspect of the set, the brown colour scheme fits perfectly with any medieval, fantasy, castle&nbsp;theme and I enjoyed modding the set much more than the original build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing you won&#39;t be disappointed with are&nbsp;the minifigures. Three (Bard, Thorin, Master) are unique to this set, so if you collect minifigs, this might be a good incentive. And with a reasonable price (not retail) you get 5 licensed minifigs, which is not bad at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, there many contradictory aspects of the set. Simple build (for kids) but low playability. Nice design but poor execution. Disappointing&nbsp;retail price but very good discount possibilities. I wonder how&nbsp;it will fit with the new sets coming soon. If you are not certain whether to buy this or not, I strongly recommend browsing through the building instructions or video reviews to know what to expect.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
