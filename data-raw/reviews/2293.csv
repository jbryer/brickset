Hurray!
Nice much purple pieces, and the see-trough pieces are also great
No minifigs
Even when the minifigs are strange flesh coloured, I want them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"deluckybrick","2007-07-16T17:55:53.34Z","Not true! I got it from Brickmaster!","As I said, I got it from my brickmaster subscription!
Anyway, good display set, cant think of any other use for it, but for the purple bits.

The bus also looks realistic compared to the one in the movie. 
I guess this is a good set, because 130 people own it!                                                                                                                                    ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T13:49:36.483Z","Cheaper and more handy than larger version","I got this at my local Strong Museum, and it didn't cost me a dime. I also loved the fact that it gave me some hard to find purple bricks. It is also good since it actually rolls around. It is also good for any ordinary race, you can race this and any other race cars and have a great time! So, go out and buy yourself a knightbus (mini) today!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-14T14:33:53.653Z","Looks too Big","Lego decides to make a Harry Potter mini set. Is it a good idea? The answer is no. First, I would like to point out that the top floor should look like the other two to be movie accurate. Second, the wheels may not hold alot of the weight especially for a mini.Also, I do like the amount of clear pieces. I really don't this was a good idea at all.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jonbuddy","2008-09-14T13:02:45.39Z","Nice Mini [Knight Bus]","This set was cool even though it was a mini. I like playing with it and comparing it with the big Knight Bus.

Good:
Accurate
It can roll

"chemxcore","2009-04-26T15:32:28.247Z","Beauty in Simplicity","Oh my god this site really catalogs everything ever made by LEGO!

I was working in a Regal movie theater when that particular HP movie came out.  I worked in the box office, and we were instructed to give them out to any kids that were seeing the movie.  This theater wasn't really popular, so we had BOXES of these things sitting around.  This should go without saying, but a devoted legomaniac like myself walked out with many of them, simply because they were legos.  The purple color was a neat idea too.  Most of these pieces pretty much had no use for me, except all the clea6 1x6 bricks.  I have no idea where all those purple pieces went, I should really find them!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"lotr_builder","2009-06-12T03:11:39.75Z","My Favorite Movie Ever! :)","Okay, I love Harry Potter. Books, movies, and especially LEGOs. When I went to see the third HP movie in theaters, we all got handed one of these (They had to pick me up off the floor after I sat down to build it. :p) And, it so happened that my friend didn't want theirs... sooooo... twice the fun. 
    This delightful little set comes with a bunch of purple pieces, and some oh-so-useful-sort-of-clear-except-for-the-tubes 1x6 bricks. Overall a great set... if I could a million Harry Potter sets, half of them would be this. :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"graymattr","2023-01-27T00:49:26.163Z","Free Purple Polybags!","<p>I took my three boys to see Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban twice so they each got two of these for free from the movie theater.&nbsp; What a great treat for kids and a nice break from the parents&#39; wallet!</p>

<p>The purple bricks were only available in one set the year before, so they were basically new to everyone that year.&nbsp; You get 34 various purple pieces in this set along with 8 transparent clear 1x2 windows, 6 1x6 windows, 2 grey bearing/axles, and 4 various black pieces.&nbsp; The highlight is the purple 2x4 brick printed with &quot;KNIGHT BUS&quot; on it.&nbsp; However, those purple hubcaps could be used on some fancy minicars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the height of this model, it&#39;s a little top-heavy and tends to tip over sometimes when played vigorously.&nbsp; It looks nice if you&#39;re aware of the movie reference - it easily fits on any desktop at your workplace or on a child&#39;s dresser to be displayed.</p>

<p>My ratings for building experience, parts, playability, and value are based on the set as a polybag set being compared to other polybags.&nbsp; As a family that were fans of the Harry Potter series, this was a fun item to collect.&nbsp; I would highly recommend it to other HP fans.</p>

"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-20T17:27:14.503Z","Purple equals awesome.","I happened to find this set in a huge collection of bricks I bought. It's a very cool set. For starters, you get 6 1x6 transparent bricks, which I thought were cool because they aren't the most common of pieces. Another show stopper is the purple wheels- very rare as they are only available in this set, as well as the KNIGHT BUS brick (link:&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/3001px18"">http://www.peeron.com/inv/parts/3001px18</a>). In other words, this set has a lot of rare pieces. As for the build, it is fast, quick, and fun. If you come across this set, I'd recommend getting it. After all, purple is awesome.",FALSE,4,5,4,3,5
