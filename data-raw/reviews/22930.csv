<p>The set comes in a Ninjago Booster pack-like polybag, which you need a scissors to open.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are the highlight of the Mixels series, and the reason I bought every single one. This set only comes with two of the new ball joint parts, 14704 Plate 1x2&nbsp;Ball Cup / Friction Middle, so I don&#39;t recommend this particular&nbsp;Mixel if you want to get some of the new ball joint parts. Flain is the only Mixel to have 15209(not yet in the database as of this review), which are&nbsp;those&nbsp;white things on his feet. It&#39;s interesting to note that the two teeth that stick out are different lengths. The only other interesting part is 32474 Voodoo Ball &Oslash;10,2 in white, with a nice eyeball on it. As for the rest of the parts, I&#39;m not sure about how rare or common they might be, but I do know that a lot of them were new to my collection.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family:arvo-fs,rockwell,courier,sans-serif; font-size:20px; letter-spacing:-0.75px"">The build</span></p>

<p>The build was pretty simple, lot of SNOT for his head.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It seems that each Mixel&nbsp;group has someone with long legs, someone with more advanced hands, and someone with neither. Flain&nbsp;is the&nbsp;someone with neither. There&#39;s not much else for me to say except that his feet can&#39;t be completely flat on your table unless you pull the axle out of the technic brick a little.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Being a MOCer I love the Mixels&nbsp;for their parts, and even though this one was lacking a little, I am glad I got it&nbsp;and would recommend it, if only for the 15209. These are are cute and will no doubt be popular with the 6+ population. I would say it&#39;s worth the $4.99.</p>

"Lego_Aidan","2014-03-16T05:06:27.267Z","Ehh, swing and a miss","<p>So let me start off, these Mixels are odd, some good, some awful. This one is inbetween, the figure itself is very silly, as intended. The cartoony look is very on and off depending on set. This one is among the better mixels and the fire on his head is cute, but these mixels to me, will never be anything more than a cute accessory on the side of a desk.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would recommend it to people who want something for fun, something to make you chuckle, but not to people who are crazy for detail.</p>

"Chilly","2014-04-13T19:47:33.917Z","The waddling wonder.","<p>Since Flain is the protagonist of LEGO mixels&nbsp;I thought not getting him would be a regret, and I was right.</p>

<h3>Packaging/Instructions</h3>

<p><strong>Packaging:&nbsp;</strong>The packaging seems pretty secure. The packaging is red with a picture of a cartoon flain from the TV shorts in the right corner.</p>

<p>Age: 6+.</p>

<p>Set number: 41500.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:&nbsp;</strong>The instructions a light blue colour scheme on the inside. That&#39;s it really.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The price per piece ratio is brilliant in this set, &pound;2.99 for 58 pieces, yes please. For the price he also comes with some great pieces such as the spike pieces used on his feet, his eyes, the flames and the hinge pieces which are used for his neck.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite good for a &pound;2.99 set. I like the technique they used for Flain&#39;s mouth. I can&#39;t think of anything other than that.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once you&#39;ve built the set, you will probably notice that his head is&nbsp;<strong>HUGE&nbsp;</strong>compared to his body, but if you remove the flame it will look a lot smaller. His legs can&#39;t move forward which makes it almost impossible to put in in a walking pose. He can move his head, arms and legs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think the set one of the best or the best mixel&nbsp;out of series 1. I would recommend it to anyone who likes LEGO mixels or the TV shorts.</p>

"Patch22","2014-04-11T20:54:57.607Z","41500 Flain Review.","<p>For such small sets these Mixels are really good and they are better than I they where going to be when I saw the first pictures.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging shows Flain and the packaging also shows the cartoon version of him on the right top corner of the package along with his name.</p>

<p>The Instructions are easy to follow and I can&#39;t spot any mistakes in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions also have a checklist of all the Series 1,2, and 3 Mixels and also contains a code for a Mixels game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces in this set are pretty cool, I really like the claw pieces on his feet, the Fire on Flain&#39;s head and the new joint parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple and fun for a small set and I enjoyed building it.</p>

<p>Plus the build is quite different compared to all of the other series one Mixels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model is very good, His head is bigger than most of the other characters, but I think it makes him more unique.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A very good set worth buying if you are interested in Mixels, Overall I liked this set more than I thought I would.</p>
