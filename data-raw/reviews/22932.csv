<h3>Packaging/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging has Volectro on it, with a Picture of his cartoon version.</p>

<p>The instructions are easy to follow and I can&#39;t spot any mistakes in it.The Instructions also have a picture of all the series 1, 2, and 3 Mixels.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces in this set are pretty good, the pieces used for his fingers and the hinges on his arms are cool, but overall I&#39;d say the best piece in this set is the part used for his hair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quick, but still quite fun and overall for a set of this price, it&#39;s pretty cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model is great and has a lot of playability,&nbsp; although his hair does fall of sometimes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set, with buying for the model it&#39;s self or the pieces, I&#39;d definitely recommend it.</p>
