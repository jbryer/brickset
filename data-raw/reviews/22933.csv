It's also just very different from the previous sets which is good thing. Great use of detain times like the chimney and roof. There will be a few mods I will like to do with the set like putting in a sink in the apartments kitchen and add a wall in the restaurant part separating the kitchen and the dinning area.<div><br></div><div>The cost of the set should have been $150 US.

"Javagirl65","2014-01-10T21:42:31.66Z","I LOVE this set so much, I wish I were a minifig!","<p>As always, the instructions were very clear and easy to follow.</p>

<p>I had no problems with any of the parts, aside from the clam shells. They kept popping open, so I glues them shut.&nbsp; I thought the usage of fenders was so clever, as was the usage of the gate as an overhead trellis.&nbsp; I appreciated the extra gold ring, as I do to own any lord of the rings sets. The married couple at town hall appreciated it : )</p>

<p>I always want more mini figs than the sets come with!&nbsp; This set has the&nbsp;appropriate characters you would expect to find. Cute waiter!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model&nbsp;looks fantastic with the rest of my modular buildings.&nbsp; This is my favorite one yet. I absolutely love the restaurant kitchen, which has more details than I excepted.&nbsp; I LOVE the apartment, especially the Murphy bed.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that the LEGO group has kicked it up a notch with this one.&nbsp; The artist loft is adorable.&nbsp; My artist from one of the series agreed and has moved in!</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2014-05-13T04:06:04.92Z","Fine Dining","<p>This is only my third modular building behind 10232 Palace Cinema and 10211 Grand Emporium. As a City theme-oriented individual I have already lost much interest in the current line of City sets which are aimed at younger audiences (only a handful of them are good) and therefore I suspect I&#39;m beginning to enter my Dark Ages of Lego. Not to mention I&#39;m terribly short on space and have other things in life (i.e. university) to focus on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the ongoing line of Advanced Models fails to disappoint and occasionally some sets will catch my attention, revitalizing my seemingly fading interest. 10243 Parisian Restaurant is an example of such a set. As with all other modular buildings, it goes above and beyond in terms of details and intricacy. In fact, I believe that this set goes even further than that, and I will explain why shortly.</p>

<p>As with 10232 Palace Cinema this set is under the Creator theme, categorized as &quot;Expert&quot; as labeled&nbsp;on the box. Once you start building you will realize why this is so. Some of the building techniques used are absolutely mind-blowing. It is easy enough to follow the instruction booklet, but summoning the creativity to devise such building techniques is quite the challenge.</p>

<p>It took me roughly 12 hours to complete the entire model. The instructions are split into three books and the bags are split into four parts. Book 1 covers Bags 1 and 2, while Books 2 and 3 cover Bags 3 and 4 respectively. The instructions come in a bag with a reinforcing piece of cardboard.</p>

<p>Minifigures include a boyfriend, girlfriend, waiter, chef, and artist, all with the classic smiley face. The boyfriend has a ring to propose to his girlfriend (same ring from&nbsp;LOTR series), the waiter is holding a tray with wine bottle on it, and the artist rides a scooter.</p>

<p>The completed model features 3 floors split into 3 modules. The first build is the main floor of the building (the actual restaurant) plus the adjacent landscape. In front of the restaurant is the outside dining area, separated from the sidewalk by chain fencing and flowerbeds. Stairs on the right lead up to the patio area and small apartment. Other details include plant pots beside stairs, bench and street lamp. The entrance to the restaurant has a small canopy above and bears the name &quot;Chez Albert&quot;. A menu list is posted beside the door.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dining area features two tables, each with two seats and a fancy lamp. At the back of the dining room is a wine display cabinet. The kitchen area is probably my favourite part of the set; the creators spared no detail when they built it. Here there are various drawers, a sink, plates, wine glasses, rolling pin, knives of three sizes, a pot, a pan, and an oven with stovetop. There are various food items such as a pie (!), cupcakes, and an entire chicken. Lastly there is a fridge right under the staircase which stores a bottle, a milk carton, and a couple cheese blocks.</p>

<p>Unlike the other modular buildings this one is substantially smaller in size and leaves a fair amount of the&nbsp;baseplate exposed. However, this is compensated with details even at the rear of the building, which include a dumpster, vines growing along the wall, garbage can, and a rat. Inside the dumpster are two sausages, two cherries, and two bones (what a waste of good food).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second build is the apartment and patio. The patio features two tables and four chairs, plus a small table with wine glass and bottle. There are two patio lights with flower pots hanging off their poles. The apartment features a fold-up bed, coffee table, stool, recliner, fireplace, and kitchen area. There are two doors that lead to the front and rear balcony, and a door which leads out to the patio and stairs to the third floor.</p>

<p>The final build is the roof/art studio. The art studio features two paintings, an easel with paintbrush, a palette, an an old fashioned iron fireplace.</p>

<p>As I mentioned the amount of detail is insane, as are the building techniques used to achieve them. I never thought that you could use feathers, shells, and croissants to decorate a roof. The overall design does indeed feel as if it could happen in Paris.</p>

<p>There are absolutely no stickers in this set. All the parts are printed, which include the milk carton, restaurant sign, menu list, and paint palette.</p>

<p>Tip: You may find that the shells used for the roof decoration will not close up properly (it might pop open after a while). This is because the shells are hinged at the connections and will want to spring back to its original open state. You can rectify this annoyance by cutting off the hinge such that you have two separate shell pieces, and connect them as such.</p>

<p>Overall this is an amazing set in which a review cannot wholly describe; I would have to write a novel to fully describe that qualities of this set. That being said you can only experience the set by actually getting it and I&#39;m telling you now at 7.7 cents per piece CAD it is quite worth buying. I&#39;m looking forward to see what modular building is next in store for us.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2014-01-12T22:12:51.95Z","My dinner with LEGO.","The bar for modular buildings continues to climb higher and higher, and the only ones who can benefit from this is us, the LEGO consumer, who eagerly awaits news of the next building to come from the mouth of our plastic gods. When looking at a set like this, it's hard not to resort to childish exhortations like ""this is the best set ever!"", but maybe there is something to be said about building something that garners exactly such a reaction.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>And so, hot on the heels of the Palace Cinema (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10232-1"">10232</a>&nbsp;- which I have yet to review because reasons) comes the Parisian Restaurant, and considering that I've been wanting an updated restaurant ever since Breezeway Cafe (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6376-1"">6376</a>), which came out almost a quarter of a century ago at the time of writing this, I was sold on this from the very beginning. But unlike a McDonald's burger, this set is exactly as advertised: every inch of it is richly detailed and extremely beautiful, and the number of cute features that you find yourself noticing along the way is so tremendously satisfying that you have to appreciate the genius that went behind this.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now, modular sets usually have a tendency to have to have a ""good side"" and a ""bad side"" - meaning, there's typically a ""front"" or at least a recommended angle that is more detailed than the others and therefore an indication of how the set should be displayed. This is fine for my purposes (and perhaps for most?) considering I don't have space in my house for 360-degree walkthroughs. Parisian Restaurant throws all that out the window, and the detail at the back is even more astonishing considering that this is not a corner set. So while Pet Shop (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10218-1"">10218</a>) is excusably meagre when viewed from behind, the restaurant cuts no corners at all and has an incredibly rich ""back"" side that's more than just an alleyway with a dumpster. The third floor art studio is, in fact, only accessible to Minifigs and human hands alike via the back, which means that you will find yourself looking for opportunities and excuses to actually pull this thing out and fiddle with it. That may come to the annoyance of some, but to be honest the details are frankly too cool to get angry with.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It's really difficult to highlight any one detail that stands out more than the others, but if I had to pick one, I would probably go with the al-fresco dining areas and the greenery that accompanies it. It's all so charming that you'll end up wishing that you could shrink yourself down into an inch-high piece of plastic and go out for French haute cuisine instead of being trapped in grim reality, but sadly, you can't. There's room for tons of Minifigs to partake in gastronomical snobbery, so you're definitely going to have plenty of opportunities to incorporate your other Minifigs into this display.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The only part worthy of any semblance of criticism would be the top-floor art studio, which was a pretty fiddly experience as a whole, though of course it came together nicely in the end. It's relatively difficult to place Minifigs inside once it's built up, and purists will definitely notice that some compromises had to be made in order to get that lovely curved roof - namely, the third floor is not exactly ""sealed"" and is bound to get drafty in the winter (suffering is conducive to art, though, right?). This, though, is probably a trivial complaint at best and hardly noticeable, and is also more than compensated for by the fact that all of the ""special"" tiles in this set are printed, NOT stickers - lesson learned from Palace Cinema, maybe?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A few final comments: owing to the restaurant's unique configuration, the floors don't quite sit nicely on top of the other, so careful adjustments may be necessary when pulling the building apart and putting it back together again for play/display purposes. Also, as you might imagine, since the right side of the restaurant is not exactly a full wall, you may need to reconfigure your town if you desire to avoid aesthetic faux pas by having a huge, naked wall buffet the second floor outdoor dining experience.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><span><span>[img]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v505/UtarEmpire/IMG_20140112_213335280.jpg[/img]</span></span><br></div><div><span><span><br></span></span></div><div><span>For reference, here is how the restaurant stacks up against the Grand Emporium (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=10211-1"">10211</a>) - surprisingly, they're about the same height, excluding the billboard, of course. And yes, those are Kryptonians on a date.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span><br></span></div><div>This is another knockout modular building, so whether you're just starting to look into the Creator line or want to add onto your town, this is definitely a must-have set for the year. It's gorgeous, it's fun, and it's the closest thing you'll ever get to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WwZkbAvBtk""><i>My Dinner With Andre</i> action figures</a>. That alone is worth the cover price in my mind.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"DrFrankenstein","2022-09-06T21:59:00.687Z","Astounding LEGO restaurant","<p>Up until now, I was able to keep my hands (and wallet) away from the LEGO modular building series, but when I saw the Parisian Restaurant, I finally caved in. The love and care that went into designing this marvel of a set is unprecedented. I will resist the urge to describe in details the aesthetical qualities and details of the set, since these have been well publicized already. However, I will join the choir and say that the restaurant is marvelous inside and out from every angle. It sets the bar so high for LEGO buildings that it will probably be a while until we see a more energizing official LEGO building.</p>

<p>Building the restaurant was a lot of fun, with the exception of two minor hitches. During the 3rd stage of the building, we found out that our set was missing two 1x2 modified plates with vertical clip (4598528) while at the same time it included two unnecessary modified 1x2 plates with stub (4210726). I read reports of other people hitting the exact same problem, so it must be a defective batch. We submitted a missing pieces report to LEGO and got the missing bricks within a week. The second glitch that we hit was with the self-opening clam shells, which we rectified easily by cutting the hinges, as recommended by a previous reviewer. Considering the size and complexity of this set, I would consider these two issues to be minor, although I would still expect of LEGO to work on reducing the set defects rate to 0. This is the only reason why I cannot give the building experience full 5 stars.</p>

<p>The finished restaurant is a treat to the eyes. It does resemble a lot the beautiful houses that one can see in France and French Canada. The colors that the designers chose for the set are very well balanced in being playful without overwhelming. The building is sturdy for the most part, with the exception of the light posts with flower vases on the second-floor patio, which tend to fall at the slightest touch.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is spectacular. It deserves hands down the crown of the best set of 2014. While the Parisian Restaurant is clearly targeting the adult audience, it would conceivably be a nice set for the teenage LEGO fans that have the patience to invest 6 hours or so into it (and shake USD 160 out of their parents&#39; wallets). Well done, LEGO.</p>

Easy build because of the great design, use of color and well done instructions, and not a single boring moment.

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is large with all sides featuring different perspectives of the building as well as the&nbsp;brick&nbsp;count with illustration. This set caught my attention online, but if I would have seen&nbsp;this first displayed at a store, it would have definitely made me go on an impulse buy because it really looks so detailed and one can easily say that whoever designed this set really put in a lot of effort and creativity to design. And to that I say kudos to the designer!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I have read previously in some reviews that they got sets with missing/wrong parts so I&nbsp;prepared&nbsp;myself for a possible disappointment. But luckily I was able to finish building my set without any missing pieces. There were even lots of extra small parts, which is a big plus. It also came with the LEGO signature orange colored brick remover, which is really useful when I made mistakes while&nbsp;building the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set came with 5 minifigures&nbsp;and a tiny rat. All are great but I would have liked it better that LEGO used varying face designs for the head bricks rather than the generic smiley ones. I like what they did for the collectible minifigure series and wish they would do the same in future LEGO Creator Expert Building sets.&nbsp;For now, I use some of the faces from my minifigure collection to make them look more unique.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I used a stop watch and clocked the construction of the set at around 6 hours with no breaks. There was never a time when I got&nbsp;stumped while building as the instructions are really very helpful. I realized that I&nbsp;really needed a big table space to be able to organize the bricks&nbsp;and build the set&nbsp;itself. I definitely enjoyed the entire time building. It is a very good time burner.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is something you would be proud to display. The color combination is nice, though I cannot really say if it followed the color scheme of actual Parisian establishments. I specifically like the window designs. I also appreciate that this is a modular set, allowing for easy viewing of each of the three levels of the building and&nbsp;the detail put into each.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Hands down the best LEGO set I have ever had. This is something a lot of adults will really appreciate and enjoy building. This set has raised the bar so I am expecting the next set to match or even be better than this set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary in this category but i do think that the amount of instruction manuals you get is unsatisfactory especially since they now have the one big books.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>2448! 2448 parts! most of them are so tiny that you can get so much detail even where it&#39;s not really needed. However there aren&#39;t many new parts but things they&#39;ve done with the older ones is just epic!</p>

Ok, so I don&#39;t have many sets and this was my first modular. It doesn&#39;t matter really, because when I pay this much for a toy, I always have second thoughts regardless of its quality. Right here, I have none. This is the first time I can&#39;t think of any criteria being less than 5/5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, the build itself is yummy. Quite simple really but hey, it&#39;s not Technic. Some stages may be monotonous for some people (like tiles, roof, some decorations), but they last for a few minutes and then you start doing something else. From time to time you need to stop building just to marvel at the results. That&#39;s why it took me 14 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are usually small, but incredibly varied. The colors I like the most are olive green and dark blue; astonishing when put together. Decorative parts are wonderful. In the kitchen there are so many accessories that you&#39;d cook yourself some dinner straight away&nbsp;if you were a minifigure. Other useful parts include lots of plants, fences, tiles, windows and of course plenty of different bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>THERE ARE NO STICKERS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures are nothing special for me. They just add to the Restaurant&#39;s playability which is quite considerable. They can cook, paint, clean windows, chase a rat, ride a bike or drink so many bottles of different brands, just to fall asleep on a nearby bench.&nbsp;</p>

<p>there was so many great unique LEGO elements in Parisian restaurant. i really enjoyed how much food pieces came with the set and i also liked the minifigure&#39;s accessories such as the scooter bike, the tray for the waiter made out of a shield and he little paintbrush and isle. i would have liked it more if the paintings were printed tiles rather that brick built.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>i really enjoyed the minifigures included in this set and how they all had a part in this very detailed LEGO set however i would have liked it if they had different faces from each other to give each of them a bit more character.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the build for this model is amazing. it is so good that i have already pulled it apart and rebuilt it 3 times. i timed my build on my ipod and it took roughly about 5 hours to build. the instructions were faultless and all of the peices needed to build the set were there. i would have liked it if they had divided the model up into more sections instead of doing it in just 4 packs. it wasnt too hard to build however there were some challenging bits in it such as the white pillars out the front of the first floor.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>once it was completed it looked stunning. i took about 100 pictures of different sections and angles of it as well as the box and instructions then put it with my other modular buildings. after that i played with it for hours on end . i added a few extra minifigures to it and added a road out the front. it was great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>in my opinion this lego set is the best lego set created so far. it includes so much detail and clever building techniques plus hours of fun building playing and displaying it. i reccomend this set very highly.</p>

"sudorum","2016-04-15T06:13:25.69Z","Lego à la Paris","<p>After visiting Paris for the first time, now over a year ago, I thought it was appropriate to finally rate this incredibly detailed set, focusing mainly on its resemblance to actual buildings&nbsp;as witnessed by an&nbsp;American eye.</p>

<p>When I first bought this one,&nbsp;I didn&#39;t think much of the fact that it was a Parisian restaurant. To me it was mainly a good complement&nbsp;to the&nbsp;older Green Grocer and Market Street sets that were food oriented. My conception&nbsp;of what Paris looked like wasn&#39;t that detailed either. Mainly, &nbsp;it was just the Eiffel Tower and that scene from <em>Inception</em> (you know the one).&nbsp;But looking out my Parisian&nbsp;hotel window across the street, it suddenly dawned on me that the buildings looked strangely familiar. Like a Lego set I had. &nbsp;Or rather, a&nbsp;Lego set I had looked remarkably like the buildings I was staring at.</p>

<p>Returning to the states, I took a <em>real&nbsp;</em>look at this set and realized just how accurate&nbsp;and jam-packed full of little details it is. First off, I think the outdoor dining area perfectly captures its real life counterpart. Quaint, cramped, yet also inviting. The addition of overhanging lights&nbsp;further adds&nbsp;a&nbsp;subtle&nbsp;magical quality to the scene. The interior dining area is just as impressive, especially with the clever touch of the man with the wedding ring who&#39;s clearly about to&nbsp;propose and share a moment of&nbsp;<em>l&#39;amour</em> with his girlfriend. The kitchen&nbsp;is also cramped, but in a good way, because it&#39;s crammed with dishes, tools, and other details that lend it a good deal of verisimilitude. Perhaps one of the inherent flaws with Lego is that it&#39;s nearly&nbsp;impossible to accurately create a space large enough that minifigures could live and work in (assuming of course that they <em>could&nbsp;</em>actually live and work). With this set it is an&nbsp;unusual&nbsp;plus, as my own experience in Parisian buildings (hotels mainly)&nbsp;was that everything was a lot cozier (the polite term) than in America.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another remarkable detail, in my opinion, is the fact that a moped is in this set. One of the very first things that stood out to me in&nbsp;Paris was how many motorcyclists there were. Far more than you&#39;d see on the average American street. I was also quite pleased by the designers&#39; decision to include a mouse, for in one particular cafe I was indeed graced by the presence of&nbsp;a mouse scrounging for scraps on the floor. The inclusion of an artistic, bohemian&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;occupying the top floor, complete with paintings and&nbsp;a brilliant&nbsp;fold-out bed to conserve space, is not surprisingly another nice touch that conforms with the reputation of Paris as an artist&#39;s city.&nbsp;In fact the only negative&nbsp;thing I can really say about this set is that the color of the building itself does not fit with those I saw in Paris. Most buildings that this cafe seems to be based on were a&nbsp;light tan color, not olive green, and had black or dark gray roof tiling, not navy blue. However, this is&nbsp;not an aesthetic flaw, and more likely than not the&nbsp;set&#39;s color scheme&nbsp;was altered away from realism&nbsp;in order to fit&nbsp;in better&nbsp;with the schemes&nbsp;of the other modular buildings.</p>

<p>All around a great set, not only for its ability to capture so many subtle details with so little room, but to stir memories as well.</p>

<p>Oh, and did I mention that&nbsp;I thought the Eiffel Tower was literally gray&nbsp;before I visited Paris? In fact, it&#39;s actually more of a rusty brown color.&nbsp;That&#39;s what a lifetime of collecting modular Legos will get you.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-01T21:28:19.137Z","First Modulars are Always Eye Opening.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10243 Parisian Restaurant:</b> It has come to that time, the time when this AFOL finally discusses his first Modular building purchase. I picked up this set from the local LEGO Store while on clearance, this was red tagged and not full price, and a very good purchase during December 2019. Oh dear&hellip; has it been that long? Amazing how a year can change perspectives. Anyway let&rsquo;s move on to discuss this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LEGO Creator packaging for Modulars is huge, this box was massive and seemed to have a lot of empty space despite having numerous numbered bags. The set imagery on the front and back is very well designed showcasing a lot of impressive detailing and attracting the eye of the buyer. I&rsquo;ve always appreciated the imagery on Modular packaging design, I just couldn&rsquo;t afford one until recently.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The back shows how this set can be connected with other sets in the range. There is also a full parts breakdown on the top side. Highly impressive design. My package was slightly shelf-worn, with a broken flap on one side. But that didn&rsquo;t concern me too badly, I wanted to build the set after all not re-sell it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You will find three manuals in this set, each manual corresponds to a single floor, as is fitting for a Modular model. This means you can build at your own pace, the instructions were very well designed and easy to follow along with. They were also packaged in a plastic bag with cardboard backing to protect them from bending or folding which is always a plus.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">When it comes to Modulars you are not buying these for the parts. That being said, there are a large selection of parts in every set. This particular one includes over ten thousand elements, a Brick Separator, windows, plants, white croissants and of course the baseplate. A very lovely selection of parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Chef: These Minifigures are not designed to include a lot of details, but the prints are still extremely suitable for these sets. A regular looking old-fashioned yellow smiling face greets us above the typical chef&rsquo;s uniform. He is holding a knife to cut the vegetables up for preparing meals.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Citizen 1: This strapping fellow lives in the upstairs apartment and has a pinstripe suit jacket with a pen in his pocket. He carries a gold ring to propose to his girlfriend I&rsquo;d wager. Overall this figure is a regular LEGO citizen.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Citizen 2: This fine young woman is about to be given a surprise, she&rsquo;s about to be asked to be married by her beau. She&rsquo;s dressed in a nice light-blue top with necklace and has orange hair. She&rsquo;s very welcome as a member of the Minifigures in this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Citizen 3: Our third and final character is a female artist who resides in the top loft where she paints pictures. She includes a red scooter and is wearing a white smock. Her long braided hair is also included, a very nice hair style and it works well staying clear of the paints and easel while she is working.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Waiter: The Waiter is dressed in a nice suit, but includes white legs, which is a bit odd, but I suspect this is part of the uniform for working here. Carrying a tray with bottle on it to the tables, he&rsquo;s prepared to help out his customers in any way.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: I have honestly forgotten how many number 1 bags were included with this set, there were more than likely at least three or so considering the number of pieces in this set LEGO splits up the parts between numerous numbered bags as part of the modular design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">With the baseplate you start the very foundations of the restaurant. It is a highly satisfying build, every step was filled with exciting moments of seeing the intricate detailing of the internal aspects of the restaurant come to life. The patio build was also quite fun as the outside eating area on the ground had loads of pleasant elements, such as the planters, the fence to separate it from the main sidewalk and so much more. Three of the five Minifigures are included in this build. A pair eating at one of the tables with a proposal imminent and a woman on a scooter outside. Very solid build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: After dealing with everything to start the foundations you continue with the outer walls of floor one. Highly enjoyable, a few moments tripped me up as I failed to note plate placement or brick placement while I was glancing back and forth between the step I was on and my parts to find all of the necessary bricks and things. That being said I wouldn&rsquo;t call that frustrating. It was more a, hey, pay closer attention, this is really more intricate than simple 5-8+ builds. The chef and waiter are also included during this step to join the couple inside.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building the kitchen alone was extremely intense as you have to line up the tiles very carefully in step one otherwise the checkerboard floor pattern will look terrible. The steps were also a tad confusing as there are some parts that are not solidly connected as part of the details of the model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: This build consists of floor two, which includes a fire escape in back and the upper seating area for the restaurant. With no more Minifigures involved now the real fun can begin. The entire build of this floor involves a lot of wall construction, intricate internal details for furniture and other elements. Then we come to the outer patio, this is really quick and simple compared to the apartment. So much fun&hellip; I&rsquo;m kind of at a loss to discuss any steps in great detail, mostly because it&rsquo;s been a while since I actually constructed the set. Oh yes, manual #2 is used for this entire build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #4: The top floor is where we get to some really tricky moments. The design of the walls made it a tad tricky when I started finishing up. Also the entire chimney section is a bit odd looking until you get the walls finished. Overall this was a seriously impressive build, every aspect of the build from 1-4 was a solid experience and I can safely say that Modular Buildings are definitely one of the best ideas LEGO ever had. Can hardly wait to get my second one.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Parisian Restaurant: This is a highly impressive model, the detailing alone is extremely impressive. I enjoyed the build even with some of the tricky elements, but once completed I enjoyed even more, finishing the entire set was a veritable treat and because this model is exceptionally amazing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Each section is a floor of the building, each build was modular in nature, it can be lifted up to reveal three interiors. The top floor is an artist studio with painting area and a great amount of detail. Access to this third floor is slightly tricky because lifting the roof up is not done as one piece, but sections.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The second floor is a regular apartment, there is also the upper balcony eating area for the restaurant. The interior includes a fireplace with chair, a kitchenette area for preparing meals, a fold down bed from the wall, a small balcony in the back and a balcony in the front with a glass door entrance, a third entrance to the fire escape is also there.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The first floor makes up an entire restaurant of course, the inside dining area is connected to the kitchen via an entrance, but you can see through straight to the food preparation area as there is no dividing wall between the too. The kitchen is loaded with shelves, a central food preparation area, a sink and oven. The door opens to the rear alleyway section which includes some climbing ivy and a garbage bin for all the trash. A rat is around and the trash can is there as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The front dining area has some nice planters and a barred awning to protect from the rays. The front entrance includes an awning as well with a sign announcing this is Chez Albert. A bench sits next to the white street lamp and the staircase leading to the balcony eating section features some hedges nearby.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The second story balcony includes some nice planters hanging off the lamps. This entire model is exceptionally detailed and full of little touches the help to elevate above typical LEGO models.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are not enough words to express my sheer delight with this set. I loved every minute of it. Loved building it, loved purchasing it loved the sheer amount if detailing that was involved to capture the look and feel of a building like this. I understand now why so many people praise these things and collect them over and over again. Highly impressed with this item, now to start figuring out the room to put more of them for a decent city block. I would Strongly Recommend this set. Strongly Recommended.</p>

<p>The exterior is beautiful, with a canopy entrance and&nbsp;a lower and upper eating area. &nbsp;There is very creative use of decorations/plants, such as the flower pots suspended from the light poles, and the hanging lanterns and ivy above the street side seating area. &nbsp;The inside is great, the top floor has an artist studio, and the mid level floor has a living area with a small kitchen, fire place, and a hideaway bed. &nbsp;The lower level is my favorite, with a beautiful dining area, and a meticulously put together&nbsp;kitchen.</p>

"andyh1984","2017-01-27T22:04:31.927Z","This will be a hard act to follow","<p>This is my first and, as of typing, only modular building which I decided to get after watching reviews of the 4 in my price range, and I think I am hooked.</p>

<p><strong>The build&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I was expecting a time consuming, very intricate and satisfying build and was not disappointed. There are more elements to build on each step but that is to be expected in an expert level set however the steps are just as clear as every other set I have built so no experienced builder&nbsp;will feel overwhelmed by this build. I took 8 and a half hours but I like to savour a large build as my joy is really in the actual building of the set but this does look spectacular when finished</p>

<p>There are some innovative uses of elements in new, interesting ways (why do I need wheelarches in a restaurant?) and all the printed pieces are printed so no wonky stickers to ruin the look.</p>

<p>As it is a modular building you build the floors separately so when you have completed the ground floor you can put it aside which is handy if you don&#39;t have much building room and the same after completing the first floor &amp; upper dining terrace (which are also separate from each other).</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>There are 5 Minifigures included, a waiter, a chef a male customer and 2 female customers. Their accessories include a gold ring (plus a spare in case they drop it in a volcano) a moped/scooter and various bottles, glasses and kitchen implements you would expect in a restaurant.</p>

<p><strong>Playability?</strong></p>

<p>This is probably designed as a display piece but could be used in play scenarios although it may be larger than many lego city buildings (unless they are also modulars) it is very sturdy and the levels seperate and re-attach easily.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I love it, It looks so much better than in the photos on Brickset and Lego.com (and they look good) you keep seeing little details that you hadn&#39;t noticed when building.</p>

<p>I seriously hadn&#39;t expected to like the whole experience as much as I did and still do, my eye keeps getting drawn across the room to it, and I had thought that if I decided against any more modulars it is an excellent standalone piece but I think it may be being joined by the detective office as soon as funds allow.</p>

"ateague","2017-02-17T19:48:48.26Z","First modular build.....","<p>This was my first modular build after getting back into Lego since my childhood. I have built a few large sets like Technic Porsche and Tower or Orthanc and this may be favourite along with the Tower. It is such a vibrant and aesthetically&nbsp;pleasing display that you just get drawn to it. It is also a pleasure to build and never really gets tedious. All of the printed pieces are a welcome addition (as in any set) and the amount of detail that is crammed into the set is really very impressive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is said that this is the best modular out there, now I haven&#39;t built all of them but if there are any as good as this set, then we are all in for a treat. This is an excellent set worthy of any collection. 5 stars, go out and buy this while you still can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this being my first modular, I was so impressed with the level of detail on the interior of the building, especially the ground level. Included here is a lovely restaurant and an extremely detailed kitchen, which was incredibly fun to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first and second floors also have a great level of detail, but not quite as much as the ground floor, given that there is less space available. However, this is compensated for with the fantastic eating terrace which includes some period style lamps and some flowers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think I was most impressed with the exterior of the building, it has to be one of the best looking modulars in my opinion. The scale and size is just right and the details on the fornt of the building is great, it&#39;s especially impressive when you realise how these various looks have been achieved through the use of existing LEGO pieces.&nbsp;</p>

"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2020-04-20T02:15:36.263Z","Probably one of Lego’s Greatest Products.","<p>The modular buildings line has produced some of Lego&rsquo;s best sets in recent years. The beautiful details, complex and creative design and wealth of parts are some of the main reasons they are loved. But does the 2014 one, the Parisian Restaurant rank highly with the others?</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Like most of the modular buildings, five minifigures are included. Although the box doesn&rsquo;t list any names, I&rsquo;ll name them &lsquo;Chef&rsquo;, &lsquo;Waiter&rsquo;, &lsquo;Boyfriend&rsquo;, &lsquo;Girlfriend&rsquo; and &lsquo;Scooter&nbsp;Girl&rsquo;.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t get a lot of LEGO Chefs nowadays, so it&rsquo;s nice to get one. That&rsquo;s all I can really say about him. Same goes for Waiter. They&rsquo;re good figures, but they&rsquo;re prints aren&rsquo;t uncommon in many sets.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;civilians&rsquo; though are more detailed with some harder to find parts. Highlights are the torsos of both Boyfriend and Scooter Girl (the darker haired one). The ring accessory included is also a very nice addition and can influence storytelling.</p>

<p><strong>Exterior:</strong></p>

<p>A scooter is included with the set, which is kind of nice.</p>

<p>The main look of the building is very inviting. The olive green bricks, which are very rare parts, go with the dark navy, grey and white&nbsp;very nicely. The facade of the restaurant itself evokes a very Parisian style and one can simply tell that it is a restaurant without context. The apartments upstairs are also very impressive with some interesting parts, like clams and croissants, to create some fascinating details.</p>

<p>The rear is also impressive with details like a dumpster, lamps, outdoor dining area and stairwell being executed very well. There are many more details out their, like an awning, garden snd bench, but it would take too long to list my complete thoughts on them all</p>

<p><strong>Floor I: Restaurant:</strong></p>

<p>The ground floor hosts the restaurant and a kitchen. Particular highlights here go to the curtains, which are built in a very unique way; the cabinet and the kitchen. The latter is quite roomy with several nice details like a fridge, drawers and several utensils and foodstuffs. This design is just beautiful and it really captures the feel of a very posh restaurant. There&nbsp;are also some tables and a&nbsp;painting&nbsp;of a ship. Very nice.</p>

<p><b>Floor II: Apartment</b></p>

<p>The second floor includes a small City style apartment.&nbsp;This area is more&nbsp;compact than downstairs,&nbsp;but still very nice. Included is&nbsp;a fold-out bed (probably the highlight of this floor), kitchen area, swivel chair and two balconies. I also really like the windows and the way they are built.</p>

<p><b>Floor III: Studio Apartment</b></p>

<p>When it comes to the interiors, the third floor&mdash;&nbsp;which is basically inside the roof&mdash; is the weakest. There isn&rsquo;t much detail inside save for some paintings and kiln. The paintings in particular might be the worst part of the set. Being&nbsp;made only with coloured tiles on a plate, I would have definitely preferred some printed tiles instead. Despite this, I really like the slopes used for the roofing and some NPU&rsquo;s involving feather, crosiant&nbsp;and clam pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Other:</strong></p>

<p>The price of this set was $250 AUD. Standard&nbsp;value for a modular, but still fair.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>This is truly one of the greatest products LEGO has released. When the eye is drawn to this, it automatically sees a beautifully made, very European restaurant. There are several fine details along the exterior from the beautiful windows to lush gardens. Inside, while the studio&nbsp;apartment&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t great, the other floors capture plenty of detail with wonderfully made furniture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one word, <i>parfait.</i></p>
