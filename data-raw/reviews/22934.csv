"mern","2014-08-09T03:24:36.887Z","Batman Goes Underwater!","<p>I picked up this set at Toysrus one day, as I needed something to do, and I thought a little building can&#39;t hurt! So I bought it. Here&#39;s what I think.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is a fairly standard size for a $13 set (sort of a square&nbsp;shape), and depicts everything in the set with a bit of an icy setting, with Gotham City in the background and the Batman and DC Comics logos in the bottom corner. On the back, there is a fight, and the play features are shown. The instructions are fairly short, and have some ads at the back, fairly standard there.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The colors of parts are mainly yellow, white, and black, with some other things in there. Some notable pieces are the eyes of the duck boat (an extra is also included), and the fact that we get 2 dynamite bundles is always nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>?Batman - This version of the Caped Crusader doesn&#39;t have a cape, but he has scuba gear instead. His dark blue scuba suit has light blue accents and is a nice variant of Batman. His accessories are a pair of flippers and a speargun.</p>

<p>?The Penguin - This version is different from the 2013 Arkham&nbsp;variant, with the fur coat print on the torso, and an evil grin on the face. He has a top hat, and carries his umbrella and a remote. Overall, I think it&#39;s nice to get him here,especially if you don&#39;t want to fork over $160 for Arkham.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build starts with Batman&#39;s vehicle, which comes in two sections, connected by a piece usually used for connecting horses to what they are pulling. I forgot to mention this earlier, but the logo on the front is printed, no stickers in the set. There are 2 flick missiles</p>

<p>Next is the Penguin&#39;s duck boat. This is my favorite build of the set, mainly because of how goofy it is. It has the rubber-duck feel, but with flick missiles and a place for someone to sit/stand. the The back has a propeller.</p>

<p>Next is an extremely quick build, the mini iceberg. This consists of a couple plats, a couple slopes, a jumper, and a gem, which the Penguin has stolen.</p>

<p>Finally, the robo-penguins are built. These are very simple, but cute little birds, with antennaes&nbsp;on their heads, to receive signals from the remote, and are carring&nbsp;dynamite, probably to throw at Batman so he doesn&#39;t&nbsp;get to the gem.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once assembled, all the parts of the set make a nice little scene, which can easily be played with or displayed right away.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set, for fans of all ages. For kids, it&#39;s something cheap you can easily convince your parents to by for you to make up for when they force you to go grocery shopping (We&#39;ve all been there). For teens and adults, it&#39;s a nice display piece, and the two exclusive figs sweeten the deal, plus some cool parts for MOC&#39;s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Those are my thoughts on this set, definitely recommended for K,T, and AFOLs&nbsp;alike!&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-10-24T01:07:29.577Z","The Return","<p><strong>Set #76010 Batman: The Penguin Face-Off: </strong>It&#39;s time to once again journey into the realm of Gotham and learn why this is an impressive little set. Like with all recent smaller sets we&#39;ll be doing a faster paced Pro Con list review for it. So let&#39;s get started shall we?</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>New Batman Minifigure with a new outfit. Scuba Batman or Aqua Batman or whatever you want to call him. Features an awesome looking print with a nice dark blue plastic colour and great looking facial print, which is double-sided.</li>
	<li>Batman has a small submarine with flick-fire missiles. Fun little build, with printed bat symbol, no stickers here folks.</li>
	<li>Buildable Penguin minions are pure fun, robotic minions for the penguin about to unleash explosive dynamite. Miniature ice flow with diamond makes an awesome set piece.</li>
	<li>Giant duck vehicle straight out of Tim Burton&#39;s Batman Returns, not 100% accurate to the original wheeled design, this vehicle is purely water based. Includes two flick-fire missiles, realistic looking duck build and all around great nostalgic looking set.</li>
	<li>Penguin Minifigure is unique to this set, wearing a fur lined jacket for keeping warm in the icy chill, includes umbrella and remote control for penguin drones. Fun expression on facial print and a great addition to the Batman Rogues Gallery in minifig form.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Batsub is awkward looking and lacks proper seating arrangements for the pilot. Also rather small, short range vehicle compared to the Batski Jetboat from the film or Batman&#39;s boat from original Batman Theme sets.</li>
	<li>Only two penguin drones for the set, considering the nature of the builds it would have been nice to see four since they are rather rare, only found in this set and one of the older Batman Theme sets from back in the day.</li>
	<li>A minor con, no comic and no minifigure checklist in the instruction manual, again a minor complaint.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty impressive little set, the pros vastly outweigh the cons for this set and the price is fairly decent. I would have liked to have seen more penguin drones to guard the diamond, however I can understand where LEGO might have felt it would have been too much. Out of all the 2014 DC Super Heroes sets this one and the Steamroller are my personal faves, so yes I strongly recommend picking this one up, bonus points for it if you can get it during a sale. It&#39;s also the cheapest way to get Penguin. I really love the nostalgic fun that is the duck vehicle the penguin uses, Batman Returns has always been one of my favorite old school Batman movies and it&#39;s always fun to see it represented in toy form.</p>

"Brick_Builder_Hero","2014-08-20T16:13:46.103Z","A Great Gift For Any Batman Fan!","<p>I&nbsp;think I picked this up close&nbsp;to Easter time&nbsp;and thought it was great.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is fairly small even for a $13 set and the instructions are small as well. And for sticker haters, there&nbsp;are&nbsp;NO&nbsp;stickers! :D</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>No exclusive or hard to find parts are included but I still think the pieces were well chosen.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Scuba Batman- the second Batman to not include a cape and the third&nbsp;to not&nbsp;have a&nbsp;Batarang, this Batman features his very own diver suit complete with oxygen tank, flippers, harpoon gun, an oxygen mask and a stylish&nbsp;dark blue color.</p>

<p>Penguin- now sporting grey trousers and a warm fur coat, this Penguin means buisness with a remote to control his dynamite-carrying RoboBirds.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build isn&#39;t that exciting but most small sets don&#39;t have that anyway.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>It looks really nice when its finished. I like the Penguin&#39;s duck boat and that it&#39;s a nod to Batman Returns, but I gotta say I am dissapointed that they didn&#39;t redesign the penguin submarine. :(</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I think this is a great gift for any Bat-fan! I rate this #7 on the Best DC Comics Sets list.</p>
