<p>My instructions were folded, but fully functional.<br />
<br />
As usual, colourful and interesting packaging, and just as usual, it was discreetly broken up and sent to the curb.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve got no complaints about the parts. Dynamite, hooks, flick missile pieces, large wing/rotor pieces, R2-D2 body pieces, and a good selection of black (always good) red and yellow pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Nightwing&nbsp;is updated, and while somewhat similar to the previous incarnation, is a welcome addition to the Batman/DC pantheon of heroes. He has double sided red printing on a black torso, two sided head (brooding and smiling), a neat spikey hair piece which I think is similar to Faora-El, and overall is a good representation of the character.</p>

<p>Classic black Batman is, like, a throw in, I guess? Awesome character, but I must have 3 or 4 of this version. He has an accurate torso, a cap, his trademark cowl and accessory (Batarang!), and the brooding/smirking double printed head.</p>

<p>Man-bat was one of those characters I was wondering about. They pallet swapped the Monster Hunters/minifigure&nbsp;vampire bat minifigures. I know I should be furious, but...it&#39;s kind of perfect. He has a double sided torso (back AND chest hair!), the usual bat arms, bat ears, and...bat pants? Regular blue jeans. He has a devious/upto no good face, and a scared face you can rotate around too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I had low expectations opening up the bags, but to be honest, it&#39;s a nifty little set.<br />
<br />
Nightwing has his glider, complete with grappling hooks, and while isn&#39;t entirely impressive, it&#39;s a neat little inclusion, which means our side kick/1b hero can do battle with the villain, and can keep up with the main piece, the Bat-copter!<br />
<br />
Coming it at over 100 pieces, the majority of the set, this is what I was fearing. It was actually an enjoyable build, and the copter ended up being another solid $20 American/ $25 Canadian offering.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:16px"">The build itself went very well with no unclear instructions, or missing pieces. The use of the &quot;stage pillar&quot; piece at the back section of the copter was something I hadn&#39;t seen in the photos, or even in the bags as I was opening, and took away from the weight of the copter, while still keeping some kind of durability.</span></p>

<p>The usual flick missiles, rotors and landing gear were all clearly visible and to be expected for a smaller helicopter. There is only so much liberty designers can take when designing aircraft and still be...realistic.</p>

<p>There is also the inclusion of the line and hook, which I think is meant to tow either Nightwing, or a defeated Man-bat, and is a neat little inclusion for a smaller set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It isn&#39;t the most&nbsp;aesthetically pleasing set I&#39;ve built, but it does look quite nice on my shelf next to some of the other super hero sets I&#39;ve picked up recently.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s not huge, but the dimensions being slightly off, the angles not being smooth...it&#39;s endearing to me on a few levels.<br />
<br />
The glider, along side the helicopter and minifigures, is scaled well, and would have been an awesome polybag. I am glad they included it, even to boost the piece count.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A definite buy.<br />
<br />
Two exclusive minifigures helps a great deal, but the set could have Robin and the Joker and it would still probably merit a high score.</p>

<p>The helicopter is a different scale to other Bat-aircraft that have been released. The closest is the Batwing, or the Tumbler/Bat set, and they come with a larger second piece, and are almost double the price for the sets.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not has high as the Lex/Superman/Wonder Woman, Venom/Fury/Spider-man or Deadpool/Wolverine/Magneto, sets in my books, but above the Black Zero Escape, Iron Man 3 Boat or Mr. Freeze/Aquaman/Arctic Batman sets.<br />
<br />
Not the best Superhero set at the price, I don&#39;t feel there are a lot of low cards in that hand though.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-10-24T01:59:48.463Z","The Man-Bat Arrives","<p><strong>Set #76011 Batman: Man-Bat Attack: </strong>LEGO is finally starting to branch out a bit from the familiar sights of the past Batman Theme. For the first time ever we get the Man-Bat villain in minifigure form, and it comes with some fun looking models and is priced fairly decently.</p>

<p>Why should you want this set? Read on and find out.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>For 2014 the box designs haven&#39;t changed too much from the original designs of DC Super Heroes. I do think they could use a nice change though and I believe we&#39;ll be getting that with 2015&#39;s sets. That being said this box works well to grab your attention, the action scene on the front shows Batman and Nightwing tackling the Man-Bat over the distant streets of Gotham.</p>

<p>You get to see the three minifigures in the right hand corner and the&nbsp;back shows off the few features of the main build.</p>

<p>The manual shows the steps for the build broken up by the two numbered bags in the set, certain younger builders may need help to get the rope for the winch in place, however other than that there&#39;s nothing too complicated or frustrating in the build. Again there are no minifigure checklists in this manual, and the image we saw in 2012 and 2013 for the minifigures is mostly found in LEGO Movie set instructions instead of the DC Super Heroes manuals.</p>

<p>The Free Comic book shows the story for this year&#39;s four sets, similar to the comic from 2013 where all of the sets are part of one big action scene instead of each set having their own silent adventure. It&#39;s a fun little comic, and works for what it is, also the poster with all the minifigures from this year and the last is actually on the back cover... So I retract my complaint from above that it was missing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not many unique parts in this set, the helicopter has a bat wing tailfin and a nifty long tail, it also includes a real working winch still there aren&#39;t many parts as I said earlier.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three with this set.</p>

<p>Batman: Nothing new here, it&#39;s the same Batman in black we&#39;ve seen before with two batarang accessories.&nbsp;His cape will eventually warp if he&#39;s left in the cockpit for too long, the same could be said of any Batman though.</p>

<p>Nightwing: Almost perfect mini-fig, he&#39;s a great new interpretation of the character and I do like the hairpiece chosen compared to the original Nightwing from the first Arkham set, unfortunately he&#39;s missing his accessories from that set, and while I love the double-sided torso print and the double-sided face with the smirking expression on one side, I feel he could benefit from his own unique hair instead of using one we&#39;ve seen in the CMF Theme. I also think his legs could have used a bit of printing.</p>

<p>Man-Bat: A first for Batman&#39;s rogues gallery, this Mini-Fig uses the Monster Fighters Bat Creature torso design, with the curved arms with the bat wings attached. His torso print is very impressive and his face and head piece are great looking, I&#39;m not a fan of the arm design to give him bat wings though, they work great for flying poses and stuff however they don&#39;t work well for holding other poses. He comes with two sticks of dynamite to throw at the Batcopter.</p>

<p>Overall some great Minifigures for this set and a nice new addition to the villains side of the minifigs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is broken up between two numbered bags, the first bag builds the cockpit and the second bag makes the tail and main rotor as well as Nightwing&#39;s small glider. Not much to say about the build itself honestly, your typical helicopter build and the small glider isn&#39;t much to discuss here so let&#39;s move on shall we...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed Batcopter is a neat looking model it really stands out as a fun looking vehicle and doesn&#39;t take up as much space as some of the other flying craft that Batman uses, it includes two flick-fire missiles for targeting Man-Bat, a real working winch and a spinning rotor with two large blades and two small... Well I&#39;m not entirely sure what they&#39;re for, the box shows Man-Bat using them to grab onto the copter, and so too does the comic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very minimal design and only includes one sticker for detailing, the bat symbol should have been a printed piece I feel, the use of a sticker here is rather wasted seeing as it and the Nightwing symbol on the glider are the only two stickers in the set.</p>

<p>Speaking of which the glider is a fun little mold all on its own with only a few minor issues, for one it&#39;s rather back heavy when Nightwing is on it and the strange hook things don&#39;t make for very decent defenses.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I think for the price this is really a decent little set, it includes two must have minifigures, a great looking Batcopter vehicle and a nice small glider for Nightwing to use. Batman himself isn&#39;t new, but he does make a nice third addition to the minifigures included with the set. I recommend this set though I&#39;d suggest going for the Steamroller or the Penguin Face-Off set before this one, mostly because I just think both of those ones have a bit more bang for your buck.</p>
