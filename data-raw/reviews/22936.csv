"JoshuaMauk","2014-01-06T12:11:46.087Z","Zoom, zoom, zoom!","<p>I received this set for Christmas from my wife and it was a big surprise as I had not seen it yet on any of my Target or LEGO Store trips.&nbsp; It was wrapped in a nice red wrapping paper that came free with LEGO Store purchases.&nbsp;Thank you LEGO Store.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The overall set is a great idea and a fun concept.&nbsp; It feels less like a getaway chase and more like a round of Mario Kart.&nbsp; I love the Batster (which&nbsp;is my name for a Batmobile roadster).&nbsp; The Drag Riddler is&nbsp; cute but could have been an even cooler Ratrod type vehicle with only a few parts being swapped out.&nbsp; I feel like DC villain vehicles need to be as heavily decorated and modified as their drivers tend to be.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Building the set was fun as most of the bat mobiles have been.&nbsp; I think there is a need for a bat vehicle with a trans light blue canopy.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I love the FLASH!&nbsp; Anytime we get Justice League Characters thrown into batman sets, I am a happy camper.&nbsp; I think there was a missed opportunity to include a Bright Red with Yellow Highlights Speedorz Piece for Flash to blast past Bats and Riddler to win the race.&nbsp; I really hope to see more JLA characters in upcoming sets.&nbsp; We need a Martian Manhunter, Cyborg, Hawkman and Hawkgirl, and about a hundred other pretty awesome mini figures.&nbsp; The new Batman design is fantastic and is a nice change to the 90&#39;s Keaton we keep getting in DC sets.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>Riddler Dragster is a little puny.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I say this is a must buy.&nbsp; The Flash figure alone is worth the price and getting new Batman and new Riddler designs are a bonus.&nbsp;</p>

"Brick_Builder_Hero","2014-01-21T18:23:38.207Z","A great Bat-set!","<p>This is so cool, its one of my favorite batman sets from the new line</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Batman (Beware the Batman) - I like the new Bat-symbol on the chest, but I think the gold belt with curved-in part on front looks really weird&nbsp;same with the&nbsp;dark grey hands.</p>

<p>The Flash (Barry Allen, I think) - Really nice lightning bolt printing&nbsp;and Flash symbol and I like the new mask instead of the clunky one from the video game. I wish they printed on the yellow boots though.</p>

<p>The Riddler (Two-tone color&nbsp;jacket) - I like the new green hat with purple question mark and multi-question mark pattern,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I wish lego would stop being cheapskates&nbsp;and make a custom&nbsp;question mark cane instead of a recolored crow bar.</p>

<p>Models</p>

<p>Batmobile (Beware the Batman) - Great batmobile with front ramming spikes, adjustable steering wheel, orange cockpit lens, thick armor, and pop-up missiles. Love it!</p>

<p>Riddler Dragster - I really like the dragster but there are some&nbsp;problems:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. a very loose&nbsp;swiveling spoiler.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. when you push it down to drop the bomb the money sometimes falls out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. only one bomb.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>&nbsp;It&#39;s a really nice set and you should get it mostly for Flash.</p>

"TeraMedia","2014-07-24T04:23:50.47Z","Could have taken it to the next level... but didn't","<p>LEGO had an opportunity to make this a phenomenal set, but instead it seems like there was a lot of make-do and tack-on.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>First, the <strong>bad</strong>.&nbsp; The dragster is weak.&nbsp; I get the sense that this model was an add-on that the marketing department made LEGO do, after seeing the batmobile model prototype.&nbsp; It isn&#39;t strong; it&#39;s flimsy.&nbsp; Parts fall off or out when you try to play with it.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t even seem to be the same <em>scale </em>as the batmobile.</p>

<p>Next, the <strong>good</strong>...&nbsp; The batmobile is sharp-looking.&nbsp; The wheels are nice, and the way they did the engine cowls in the back is pretty slick.&nbsp; It is clear that a lot of time was spent on the aesthetics of this design.</p>

<p>But not <strong><em>great</em></strong>... the build-design of the batmobile seems to indicate that they were trying to make the one from one of the movies where the sides blew off and it ended up as&nbsp;a skinny car with a narrow wheel-base.&nbsp; Indeed, the sides on this model are held on by pairs of technic pegs, and come off easily.&nbsp; Inside of the front wheels are&nbsp;a pair of thin disks (brakes?) that could have been done as separate &quot;skinny-mode&quot; wheels.&nbsp; My guess is that they ran into some design hurdles that they couldn&#39;t overcome, and gave up on the transformability concept in favor of appearance.&nbsp; But that would have been a <strong>cool </strong>model if they had pulled it off!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you buy this set for the models it makes, consider whether you would pay the price for the batmobile alone, and base your decision on that.</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2014-06-08T18:44:36.08Z","The Flash. Title says all.","<p>I was looking forward to this from&nbsp;SDCC&nbsp;and got this in Feb 2014. How does it fare? Let&#39;s find out!</p>

<p>Box/Instructions<br />
The box is&nbsp;kinda&nbsp;small on the shelf. $30 set boxes were bigger two years ago. Shows the play features and attempts to make the dragster look good. The instructions are split into two books, which is not really necessary. The set is in 3 bags: One with the dragster and two with the&nbsp;Batmobile.</p>

<p>Parts<br />
There are some good parts here: Flash&#39;s cowl, new axle pins,&nbsp;1x2&nbsp;curved slopes, $100 bills, sacks,&nbsp;5L&nbsp;axles with end stop, gold wheels, big canopy, gold crowbar, mystery banana, and loads of SNOT brackets, angle plates, and hinge bricks.<br />
Minifigures<br />
Flash&#39;s cowl is rubber, so the paint scratches off the ends of the bolts. He really needs some printed boots. Otherwise, well done.<br />
<br />
Riddler: The two-color jumpsuit doesn&#39;t work well, but the gold crowbar is better than a red one and the bowler hat is BOSS. His hands are my only Dark Purple parts.<br />
Batman: He&#39;s actually exclusive, which is better than they can do for&nbsp;Spidey. My only other Bats is the white one, but this guy needs more black. The cape is as annoying as ever.<br />
The build<br />
A brief but fun build. The dragster was really quick and I had a little trouble aligning Technic bricks in the&nbsp;Batmobile. I love all the curves and flick missiles that WORK.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Now, there are a few shortcomings here. The Riddler&#39;s dragster is weak, non-canon, and has a horrible connection in the back: A Technic click-hinge link on the bar of a&nbsp;1x2&nbsp;plate with bar sticking up. Weak, weak, horribly weak. The worst part is, they&#39;ve used it before. Awful. The&nbsp;Batmobile&nbsp;is a little&nbsp;gappy, a little&nbsp;underdetailed, and a bit multicolored, but it works. Also, it&#39;s actually based off of a real one.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is hard to decide upon. On the one hand, the&nbsp;Batmobile&nbsp;is good and the figs are great, but that dragster is pure fail. I parted this one out pretty quick. I give it 3/5. Get it for the figs and the&nbsp;Batmobile. but part out that dragster IMMEDIATELY. It doesn&#39;t have a whole lot of parts for $30, though.</p>

<p>EDIT 3/31/2015: With the release of Gorilla Grodd Goes Bananas, this set is now pretty much entirely worthless. Please don&#39;t waste $30 on this thing now. Grodd will give you Flash, a superior Batman, and a host of other great figures.</p>
