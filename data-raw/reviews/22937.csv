Batman: The Joker Steamroller is the largest of the&nbsp;DC Comics Superheroes sets released this year by Lego and comes in on my list as one of my favorite sets of 2014. This set has 4 exclusive figures, two new vehicles, loads of playability, and has a very low sticker count (because really,&nbsp;isn&#39;t that all that&nbsp;matters when deciding whether or not to buy a set?). I find myself continuously coming back to this set whenever&nbsp;looking for a set to pull of the shelf and toy with while relaxing and doing something like&nbsp;watching tv, reading, or listening to music. Its nice to just tinker with and play with the features and functions the set has to offer. There aren&#39;t a lot of sets that have that kind of appeal to me anymore&nbsp;since I&#39;m an AFOL that finds value in a products&nbsp;collectable&nbsp;figures and haven&#39;t truly played with my Lego sets&nbsp;in a couple years.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a decent variety of parts with an array of color included in the set, although for me there aren&#39;t any pieces that stand out in particular. I&#39;m not sure if the red slopes used to make up the bottom lip of the mouth on the Steamroller are new to 2014, but they are definitely new to my collection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Batman- If you collect DC Superheroes or The Lego Movie sets&nbsp;you probably have one of these versions of Batman by now. Its suppose to resemble the Tim Burton&nbsp;Batman. There isn&#39;t much more to say about this common minifig.</p>

<p>Robin- This version of Robin is the first iteration of Damian Wayne, the son of Bruce Wayne and Talia Al Ghul&nbsp;(Daughter of the&nbsp;Ra Al Ghul). Bit of is&nbsp;background is&nbsp;he was raised by his mother up until the age of ten (give or take a year, i&#39;m not entirely sure) until he was introduced to Batman, who took him under his wing even though the two struggled to find common ground at first, being that he was raised with the ideals taught to him by the League of Assassin&#39;s. Really love his two facial expressions, one being an aggressive facial expression for when he&#39;s in combat and another for when he is scared. Personally for me this second expression is more defined by a very important&nbsp;moment in the characters history, when he is brutally murdered in Batman Incorporated Volume 2, which just gives this figure a kind of&nbsp;grim appeal. I&#39;ve noticed Lego include these expressions in other scenes from different themes such as the A-wing Pilot&#39;s second expression, which was&nbsp;very similar to one made by a pilot crashing into the Super Star Destroyer in Return of the Jedi.</p>

<p>Batgirl- This is the New 52 version of Barbara Gordon, aka Batgirl&nbsp;and daughter of the Gotham City Police Comissioner.&nbsp;I&#39;ll just start of by saying this was the biggest initial&nbsp;draw of the set for me. I am a huge fan of the New 52 Batgirl comics and she is by far one of my favorite characters&nbsp;in the DC universe and&nbsp;she is brilliantly portrayed in Lego form. She comes with the first version of a Batman cape in a purple color and has a new head mold that depicts her black cowl and long red hair. She has two facial expressions, one being a casual smile and the other an aggressive face for when she is fighting crime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Joker- It&#39;s good to see another new version of the character after the 2013 Arkham Breakout version&nbsp;and not another standard Joker minifigure. I don&#39;t believe this one resembles any particular&nbsp;iteration of the joker, although he does seem very reminiscent&nbsp;to Jack Nicholson&#39;s Joker with the purple hat, but also reminds me of The Killing Joke version of the joker when he paralyzes&nbsp;Barbara Gordon right in front of the commissioner at his house by shooting a bullet into her spine. This is only the second time i believe this hat has appeared in any Lego sets, the first being the Space Police theme. He has a new facial expression, this time with a crooked smile, and his torso is also new but I only notice some small differences on the front and back. He comes with his BANG gun, this one with stickers (similar to the one back in 2006)&nbsp;on the front and back.</p>

<p>Joker Henchman- It&#39;s good to see another henchman to go along side the joker, and this one is wearing a construction crew uniform (no doubt to go along with the steamroller). Some great clown printing on the face and a very colorful torso, with the back of his safety vest&nbsp;reading &quot;The Joker De Construction&quot;, with the letters &quot;Con&quot; crossed out so it reads out as The Joker Destruction, which i found mildly amusing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I really enjoyed the building process.&nbsp;The steamroller was quite simple and light build to construct and the Batwing was more of a dense model &nbsp;to put together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Joker steamroller is a great addition&nbsp;to any fans collection, not only because it is a very colorful&nbsp;model, but also because&nbsp;this is the exact kind of thing you&#39;d expect to see the Joker drive (or not expect&nbsp;being that he&#39;s the Joker). The Batwing, which yes oddly it is a Batwing, is also actually a great model. The main function of swinging the two front wings forward to slam the bad guy seemed quite odd to me at first, but the function grew on me and the way I use it is by having the wings in front when landed, and when he takes of they extend out in a swooshing fashion, which I&nbsp;find far more appealing for the vehicle to do. It&#39;s definitely different than what you expect, but in person it really is a pretty good attempt at a Batwing, even though Lego has yet to release a Batwing a good as the original back in 06&#39;, but being that I don&#39;t have that model assembled anymore since&nbsp;the pieces&nbsp;are scattered across different drawers of my unassorted Lego bricks, this and the 2012 version will both satisfy kids and adults alike very much so.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Like I&nbsp;said early this is an amazing set. If you don&#39;t have it yet, you might want to consider buying it, even if at a reduced price. It&#39;s a great value for its price and pieces,&nbsp;and is truly splendid in all the ways I&#39;ve mentioned above. I hope you enjoyed reading this review and found it helpful, bye!</p>

"8BrickMario","2015-03-01T23:51:17.563Z","Wouldn't this thing be easy to avoid?","<p>I love this theme. I always have, and since this set offered both an interesting model and some exclusive figures, I couldn&#39;t pass it up.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box looks good, like most sets, and it has a nice action shot of Batgirl in midair beside the Batplane, while Robin is being chased by the steam roller. The instructions were clear and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Steam Roller itself offers the most interesting parts. Some inverted curved slopes appear in red (used on the lips) and the large purple wheels are exclusive. The Steam Roller brings back the orange textured wheels from the Power Miners theme. The clown-face domes used on the laughing gas missiles&nbsp;are brought back from the Batwing Battle set in 2012. Some lime green and yellow pieces are also useful. The Batplane uses more basic parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Batman- Nothing new here, this version has appeared in a few sets before.</p>

<p>Joker- This version is quite nice. He wears a slightly different suit with a different colored vest and tie, accompanied by a purple fedora. Because he wears a hat, he only has one printed face, but it&#39;s a new one with a more lopsided or determined grin. Joker finally has a proper BANG! flag gun, like the one used in the old Batman theme. It consists of a banner&nbsp;flag piece (stickered) attached to a pole inside a megaphone, and it&#39;s much better than the flag-on-tommy-gun approach in the last Joker-centric set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Batgirl-&nbsp;Probably the best figure in the set. Based on Barbara Gordon&#39;s New 52 appearance, she looks fantastic. Batgirl features a new half-cowl piece with her red hair flowing down her back. She uses Batman&#39;s cape in lavender, and her torso printing is accurate to the source material. She has a confident face and an angry face.</p>

<p>Robin (Damian Wayne)- It was a surprise to be seeing this version of Robin, but he&#39;s welcome. To represent his young age, he has short black legs and a short yellow cape to acommodate his height. His torso has new printing, and he has black sleeves and green gloves. His head has a green mask, and he has angry and scared expressions. His weapon is a pole piece, meant to represent his staff.</p>

<p>Joker Construction Henchman- This one is rather well done for a minor character. His uniform is meant to resemble a construction outfit, touched up to serve the Joker. The &quot;Construction&quot; label on the back of his vest has been altered to say &quot;THE JOKER DEstuction&quot; Under the vest, the goon wears a green-striped shirt. The henchman has purple pants and black gloves. His face resembles the previous clown goon&#39;s, but the makeup is more realistic, appearing to be messily applied and not outlined. Dr. Harleen Quinzel&#39;s alternate face featured a very similar makeup printing. The henchman has an angry face, and his yellow helmet is uncommon,</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly easy, though the way the roller is attached was rather different to me, as it&#39;s held in by the sides of the frame instead of being attached by pins. Watching the lips come together on the Steam Roller was fun, and it&#39;s an excellent design.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Batplane has been maligned by many, but it&#39;s not that bad to me. (Why does LEGO call it the Batwing? That&#39;s another Batplane, the one in the 2012 sets!) The wings feature two flick-missiles each, and Batman fits comfortably sans cape in the cockpit. The signature bat wing on the back adds a nice touch, and the yellow accents work well. The main play feature of the Batplane is to move a section linked to the wings to swing them forward and close them together. LEGO suggests that it&#39;s to catch the Joker, but I think it makes more sense for Batcave parking, as it takes up less space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Joker&#39;s Steam Roller is just an excellent idea. Many cartoon characters have been flattened by steam rollers, but in real life it would be deadly. This has been explored with the same concept and vehicle&nbsp;in&nbsp;<em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em>&nbsp;and it works well for the Joker&#39;s twisted cartoon gimmicks. It manages to be both colorful and creepy. The lips and headlights form a grinning face, and the bumps on the wheels ensure that anything underneath would get crunched up as well as flattened. The cab&#39;s roof is fairly weak in connection, but it can be removed. The only feature inside the cab is a steering wheel. The back wheels have some neat colorful hubcaps, and the back section is fairly basic, with a smokestack and a few places you could pose figures in battle. The front roller is attached with a ratcheting joint that allows the roller to move slightly left and right, but it&#39;s probably not intentional. The thing rolls smoothly, although not all of the wheels are locked together. To add an additional threat, there are two laughing gas missiles loaded on the side of the roller&#39;s frame. For the second time since the flick-missile&#39;s invention, these use axle pieces inside the sockets, and thus are completely loose. They do not go at all far when flicked, although the use of the missile parts would have made the entire assemblies spin when the missile was flicked. It would have been better if the missiles were fixed parallel to the ground or if they had a remote launching system. Some handles and &quot;steps&quot; are included on both sides of the vehicle, so the Joker can hang onto the sides.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I quite like this set. I consider this Joker vehicle superior to the helicopter because it looks so good and the concept (cartoon violence that would be deadly in real life) works so well for the Joker. There&#39;s nothing &quot;bad&quot; about the set, just some things that could be better. The models and minifigures are both good, so I would recommend getting it before it&#39;s gone.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T21:42:25.76Z","Holy Rumbling Ruination Batman!","<p><strong>Set #76013 Batman: The Joker Steam Roller: </strong>In 2014 LEGO DC gave us four sets in total, a relatively small number of sets compared to the huge numbers we got at retail from Marvel, however DC really stood out with this set and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: This is one big box, and it looks great. The cool blues as always stand out when compared to the hot reds of the Marvel sets and here you get to see the full contents of this set in action. To the point where you&rsquo;re just itching to put this thing together. The back does its job showcasing the features of the set succinctly and as usual you can&rsquo;t go wrong with LEGO box designs.</p>

<p>Instructions: This set features two numbered manuals, each one splitting the build up between the numbered bags, resulting in each manual building one vehicle from the set. The first manual builds the Joker&rsquo;s titular vehicle, following all of the steps for each bag will complete the build relatively simply and easily. You&rsquo;ll find the parts breakdown and the cross-promotional images in the back of this manual.</p>

<p>The second manual builds Batman&rsquo;s new Batplane, there are no cross-promotional images in this manual, each vehicle is broken up between two numbered bags and the steps to follow aren&rsquo;t too tricky or difficult. The final elements of the Batplane may be a bit harder, it depends as always on the experience of the younger builder, and how finicky the gimmick takes for the large wings on the vehicle.</p>

<p>Comic Book: This little add-in is included in all four of the 2014 sets, it&rsquo;s a fun little picture show of the storyline behind each set, and the back cover includes a full image of the Minifigures from 2013 and 2014.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The large steamroller parts in this set might be of use, they are orange and purple respectively to match the colours of The Joker, there are some usual parts in this set as well in black and medium stone grey of course, but the most unique in my eyes are the steamroller parts. (Which I believe are just large wheel pieces commonly found on drill tanks and similar types from the Ninjago theme.)</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Batgirl: The biggest draw for this set is Batgirl, she&rsquo;s a brand new Minifigure that hasn&rsquo;t been seen before and she includes a brand new cowl piece with hair attached, a nice light purple cape and the batarang accessory. Her torso is double-sided with the Batgirl costume, a nice gold bat symbol adorns her chest and she has a gold utility belt, even her hands are gold, a pearl gold naturally. She includes a dual-sided face with a smiling expression on one side and an angry looking expression on the other. Great Minifigure.</p>

<p>Batman: Nothing new to this Batman figure, he&rsquo;s your standard black suited Batman as seen since 2012, he has the older cowl piece, the same dual sided head and the same print on the torso, as well as the batarang accessory.</p>

<p>Goon: With a red crowbar for an accessory this hard-hated minion of the Joker drives the Steam Roller. He includes a nice light yellow construction hat, some great face printing with white face paint and clown makeup to show who he serves. His torso has a nice LEGO construction vest print with an undershirt, the back has some new writing saying The Joker Destruction with the Con part of the word crossed off. No leg printing unfortunately.</p>

<p>Robin: This short legged version of Robin is based on Damian Wayne, the Robin costume is fairly standard, though it is a different print. A darker tone of red, with black instead of red arms and a yellow utility belt. He has a short yellow cape, a dual-sided face with an angry expression on one side and a scared one on the other. He includes a long black staff accessory for a weapon.</p>

<p>The Joker: This iteration of the Joker has a different look to him than the first version with a blue under vest or cumberbund or something, with a smaller green tie and this time the purple hat made famous by Tim Burton&rsquo;s Batman. For an accessory he includes a BANG gun with a flag sticking out. He also only has a single sided facial print.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Bag 1: In this bag you get to start on the Joker&rsquo;s Steam Roller, the frame of the vehicle is built here alongside three of the Minifigures, Joker, his Goon and Batman. Building a Steam Roller is not very common in LEGO, outside of City sets you rarely seen this type of vehicle, and the build here is what you&rsquo;d expect of this type of vehicle for the chassis. The biggest difference however is the large pair of smiling lips that the Joker uses to customize this vehicle as he does with all of his rides. This is a very clever bit of building and I&rsquo;m a sucker for a good Joker build, definitely the stand out of this portion of the build.</p>

<p>Bag 2: This will finish off the steam roller, there&rsquo;s very little to build here on the vehicle itself, you&rsquo;re basically just finishing off the cockpit/driver&rsquo;s compartment for the steam roller. Then you move on to the steam roller portion itself, which requires careful attention to each step as it does involve using a technic axle and placing pieces on just right to catch the look of it. It&rsquo;s a fairly straight forward build, no real trouble spots aside from the careful placement of technic and non-technic pieces to make the steam roller.</p>

<p>Bag 3: We start Batman&rsquo;s new Batwing design with the underside of the frame for the fuselage, which includes a very unusual wing design. Batgirl and Robin are also in this bag finishing off the Minifigure selection. As you move on through this portion of the build you&rsquo;ll find it start to get a bit top heavy and awkward in the design due to the method for building up the wings. They are on hinge plates and until you fortify it, sore it up so to speak, you will see some of the parts easily separating while handling the build.</p>

<p>Bag 4: Somewhat confusing here as the image of the contents of Bag 3 once finished is an incomplete one, so bag four starts adding on what has already been built in bag 3, but with a bit more already finished in the previous build than you expect. This portion completes the cockpit and the wings with their odd play feature, the only really difficult part for this portion of the build is getting that gimmick to fit in properly, if the wings are out of joint you&rsquo;ll need to readjust before finishing the build. Other than that this one gets by relatively quickly. Throughout the entire build I believe the only sticker used aside from Joker&rsquo;s Bang flag is the bat symbol on the plane.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Steam Roller: I&rsquo;m a huge fan of unique vehicle designs, LEGO has a tendency to make tons of sports cars, trucks and other such things, so when you get to build a model like this you really have loads of fun. Especially once its complete. The Steam Roller is designed to be a Joker Vehicle, with orange, green and purple colours mixing together to make an awesome and fun looking vehicle. The large steam roller rolls along quite nicely and for play features you get two Joker missiles, which can be launched from either side of the front of the vehicle by flicking your finger at them. The only downside to this vehicle is the lack of interior detailing for the driver&rsquo;s compartment, it&rsquo;s a huge empty space without very much going for it. This is to accommodate both Minifigures, so it isn&rsquo;t terribly, however it does suffer from a design standpoint because of this.</p>

<p>The Batwing: This version of the Batwing is very odd looking from a design standpoint. It has two large wings that spread out in front, where you&rsquo;ll find two flick-fire missiles to launch at the Joker&rsquo;s Steam Roller. The cockpit design is similar to what I&rsquo;d envision a Batman Forever version of the Batwing might look like, the wings are designed so oddly because the main play feature has you pushing the wings together to ensnare a Minifigure between a pair of large pincers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not particularly a fan of this design, it&rsquo;s too large on the shelf so it makes the model difficult to display with your other LEGO DC sets, and the gimmick just doesn&rsquo;t make a whole lot of sense, why would you want your plane to slam its wings together to capture someone, how would it stay airborne if the wings suddenly swung forward in front of the cockpit? I suppose in LEGO you can make any weird and crazy design you&rsquo;d care to, but somehow I prefer the simpler design of the 2012 Batwing compared to this one.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This set has been retired now, but it&rsquo;s still the best offering from the 2014 LEGO DC Super Heroes sets, mostly for the interesting creation of a vehicle like the Steam Roller for the Joker. It also is the only set to date that features Batgirl in Minifigure form, while I personally am not a huge fan of the Batwing design in this set, I can excuse that for the sake of enjoying the rest of this fairly impressive sets.</p>

<p>If you can only get one set from 2014 I&rsquo;d have to say this one was definitely worth that one slot, so I&rsquo;d strongly recommend this set. You get a great vehicle in The Joker&rsquo;s Steam Roller, a so-so vehicle in the Batwing and five great Minifigures including Batgirl and The Joker in his purple hat.</p>

"AdamDaLegoGuy","2017-03-18T23:35:54.467Z","Best set ever!","<p>MINIFIGS: *The joker is great. He reminds me of the Jack Nicholson Joker because of the purple hat. I am also happy with the return of the &quot;bang&quot; gun.</p>

<p>*Batman... well, what can you say? It&#39;s Batman!</p>

<p>*Robin looks very good to me, except the short legs trip me up a bit. I don&#39;t know why Lego did this.</p>

<p>*Batgirl is, in my opinion, the best fig in the set! The body and legs are done well, and the hair/cowl piece is superb. It also is not very often that you get a pink cape from Lego.</p>

<p>*The Joker&#39;s goon may not be too special, but I think he is better than some other goons we have received.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>STEAMROLLER: This colorful and whacky vehicle just has Joker written all over it! I love the purple wheels and I like that they made an actual mouth in the front. I also am happy with how the colors are in a pattern that represent the jokers whole body. The only flaw I find here is how frequently the gas bombs fall out of their firing areas. There just is not enough friction for them to stay put.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BATWING: Even in 2017 (or possibly later for some of you) I think this is the best batwing we have ever gotten. The movement of the wings is not only nice to switch from landing to flight mode, but is useful for&nbsp;chopping up some minifigs! It has dual flick fire missiles on each side (cause it just wouldn&#39;t be a Lego set without flick fire missiles) and I like the engine pieces it has on each side of the cockpit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OVERALL: This set may be retired, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from calling this the best set I have ever owned. You get five excellent minifigures, and two of the best vehicles I have ever seen in Lego form. It is a simple build, and has a lot of play value packed in. For $50, you get every Penney that you pay!</p>
