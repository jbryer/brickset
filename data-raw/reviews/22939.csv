As always I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the eagle tribe and their sets, a shame the raven legend beast didn&rsquo;t get made also. Anyway let&rsquo;s discuss the set in question, the goods, the not-the-bests and the pure awesomeness.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Not much new to say about the box design that I didn&rsquo;t cover in the other legend beast reviews. However I will say I love the image of Eris and the Legend Beast on the back. It shows a great image of the eagle that the set almost lives up to.</p>

<p>The instructions are the same we&rsquo;ve seen previously. The steps are very straightforward and there aren&rsquo;t any annoying or tricky bits of the build. Sticker sheet included in this set as well and the card to scan the beast into the online game.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>A lot of white and blue pieces in this set, there are only a few of the new ball joints in this set due to the nature of the eagle design. There are four of the blue wing pieces, personally I&rsquo;m not sure how useful this set is for a parts pack compared to some of the other legend beasts, however for the price there is a nice selection of standard parts.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Eris: This version is the same print detail found in the Eagle Interceptor from 2013. She has the same double-sided torso, double-sided face, armour accessory piece, leg printing and head piece. The difference for her is the weapon and the shield piece. The weapon is pretty similar to the one in the Eagle Interceptor, however I believe it has an extra handle piece compared to the weapon in the other set.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This set has a very fast build. It uses stickers for the detailing in key areas, which is something that might upset some of you. The build features nothing too unique, it is a bit thicker in the torso compared to the rear section, in order to accommodate the minifigure. The placement of the joints for the legs could use a bit of a tweak in my opinion, it hinders some of the leg motion of the fun micro ball joint pieces used for the legs. The build for the eagle head is just awesome, it&rsquo;s a nice use of parts to make up a fully functional bird head.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The eagle legend beast model isn&rsquo;t too bad. The wing joints are limited in their mobility, you can only make them move up and down. No back and forth motion for having the wings rest at the eagle&rsquo;s sides. The back of the eagle looks terrible, the chest and neck area is built up, but the back is left flat to accommodate Eris. Which means when she&rsquo;s not sitting on the back there is a massive gap in between the torso and the tail. The use of the stickers for feathered detailing on the head, and other key areas is a bit of a disappointment. Some nice organic looking armour prints would have worked so much better, and would have made the pieces way more useful in MOCs.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Not a bad little set for the asking price. No unique minifigures and a fairly hindered mobility design for the eagle knock a few points off, however I&rsquo;d still recommend this while you can find it because the Legend Beasts do offer some interesting and fun little builds to play and display with. The parts are also useful if you&rsquo;re a fan of Power Rangers Zords, I can see these being used as a basis for a nifty combined robot form, with a few extra pieces. Recommended.</p>

"RandOpossum","2022-02-21T20:51:30.4Z","Incredible set!!","<p>The Eagle Legend Beast is such a great set. It&#39;s my favorite out of the four Beasts as it&#39;s the most detailed one and the most fun to build. Unlike the other sets, this one does not feel goofy because&nbsp;it has great proportions and a cool color scheme, ignoring the eyes of course. The price per part PLUS the price per mini figure makes this set&nbsp;such a huge gain! For 19 bucks you are getting this incredible set!! Its even better if you buy it at retail price!!&nbsp;It looks great on my shelf alongside Eris, which is one of my favorite Chima characters design wise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I gave 4 stars for the parts because first, the eyes look super goofy. Second, there are stickers, which is unfortunate because my hands shake a lot and makes the final product look a bit rushed. Third, you can change the angle of the feathers / tail / toes, which is a big problem for playability AND for poses since an excess of force will make the pieces look asymmetrical.</p>
