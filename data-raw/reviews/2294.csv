You get harry

It has several moving parts (such as the stool), several great elements (the goblet, Hedwig, etc.), and provided me with many hours of entertainment when I was younger.

The built of this model is quick and easy and this set is very sturdy. You also don't have to worry about stickers. This set includes another LEGO Harry Potter minifig but this time his uniform looks much different than the other uniforms of that theme.

"BobaFett2","2011-01-19T12:57:49.5Z","Not at all based on the movie","This set is certainly odd. It's not at all based on the story-no wheel was spun. And there certainly wasn't an owl behind him.<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It shows Harry Jumping off a platform while the hat floats after him. I don't really understand, but it's well-done.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The best part, is, of course, the disk. It's very useful. You also get a black wizard hat, a large brown angled plate, an owl, some torches, and a few other great parts. Other notable parts include a modified 2x2 tile with TECHNIC pin sticking up, old wheel, and rotating piece.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Harry Potter-he's not amazing, but he's not bad. What's odd is that he has an Invisibility Cloak-he didn't have that at the time.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's pretty simple. Not exactly entertaining, but it's not bad for a set this size.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's odd. It does have a feature which makes for nice playability, but it really doesn't fit into the movie. And it doesn't look particularly amazing.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I like this set for a few reasons, but it doesn't fit into the movie. It makes for a great addition to a Harry Potter Collection, especially because of the dish and hat, but it doesn't fit into the theme.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"AETerry","2010-11-04T15:37:45.91Z","Sorting Hat Review","<p>I got this as a Christmas Stocking Stuffer... so no complaints from me there regarding the price of this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set's alright... You get Harry Potter, his owl Hedwig and the Sorting Hat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the Spinning Disk, I'd have designed the spinning a little bit differently so that there's a chair Harry's sitting in while wearing the Hat and the disk is behind, upright almost like a Game Show Wheel that's spun. </p>

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-05T12:01:11.82Z","Sorcery, Hogwarts and LEGO Collide","<p>Set #4701 Sorting Hat: Ah Harry Potter. I sold off my entire collection for the sake of making more storage space for my LEGO that I was keeping and I truly don't regret the decision. The newer Harry Potter sets will be much better for my display as opposed to these older sets. That being said however they are still a great Theme and fun to collect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Theme's go Harry Potter is akin to a Fantasy based Castle Theme. And as far as this set goes... Well it isn't much to look at. In order to make for an exciting sorting hat based set LEGO gave us a strange looking pedestal/platform combination on which the hat rests. Using a spinning plate printed with the images of the four houses you can choose which house Harry (Or any other Mini-Figure) will be sorted into.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This play feature is all well and good for the first few times, but after a while there really isn't much you can do with this set. Points going for this set however are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a cheap set. It offers a unique Harry Potter Mini-Figure with un-sorted Hogwarts uniform. You get a snowy white owl (Hedwig), the black sorting hat, a nice printed circular piece with the four houses pictured on it, an old Castle plate printed with the scroll element that all Majisto sets came with, two yellow goblets and two different wizard's wands. (The black one is used as the sorting tool.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this set can be skipped over in any Harry Potter collection and you wouldn't be missing out on much. But if you're particularly fond of the gimmick of this set or desire a regular Hogwarts uniform without any house crests for MOCing Mini-Figs you might not want to skip over it. The pieces may also be useful in creating some sort of addition to your Hogwarts Castle. If I was to buy back all of the yellow Mini-figure sets I once had I'd probably skip this one myself though because really how many Harry Mini-Figures does a single person need? This set would have been much better if LEGO had also offered up a cheap method for getting Professor McGonagall with it.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"HarryPotterLegoCollector","2020-10-05T14:06:09.5Z","A good starter set, it was a must to build. ","<p>This is a set they just had to build to recreate one of the first scenes at Hogwarts. When it first come out it was great value for money!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- It&#39;s a quick and easy build- doesn&#39;t take up too much room</p>

<p>- The house sorter spins and I love that its in vibrant colours</p>

<p>- The Harry Potter figure is unique to this set!</p>

<p><br />
Cons:</p>

<p>- The sorting hat is black, I would prefer brown like in the films. The face on it could be nice but that might be pushing it especially in 2001.</p>

<p>- The seat and where the name list turns. I find this too much and not necessary, it could have work well if not better if these didn&#39;t move.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- The name list falls out all the time which gets annoying</p>

<p>-There is nowhere to store the wand or hair/hat when not in use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To make this set better I would have LOVED to see Professor McGonagall figure included it would have made more playable.&nbsp;</p>
