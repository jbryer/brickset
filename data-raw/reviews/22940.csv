<p>The model is like &quot;70008 Gorzan&#39;s Gorilla Striker&quot; but smaller. &nbsp;It comes with one mini-figure &quot;Gorzan&quot; and he comes with a hammer, a shield, and a golden mantle. &nbsp;It does comes with two printed pieces the &quot;eyes&quot; and &quot;mouth / nose&quot; every thing else is a sticker. &nbsp;The model does come with the new ball and socket joints. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The model&#39;s legs&nbsp;do look a little small to me. &nbsp;Other than that point, it is a good set at a good price. &nbsp;But all the &quot;Legend Beast&quot; are at the same price point. &nbsp;</p>
