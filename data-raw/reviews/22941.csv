"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T02:18:35.74Z","The Legends Return","<p><strong>Set #70126 Crocodile Legend Beast: </strong>LEGO introduced some brand new style of pieces with the 2014 Legends of Chima sets, those were the smaller ball and socket joints that have allowed for some awesome new MOC opportunities. They also feature prominently in the new Mixels line. Only five of the legend beasts as seen on the show were created so far, there may still be hope of seeing the others. Though I&rsquo;m not sure about that with the Fire vs. Ice theme being the dominant play feature of the line.</p>

<p>This set is a fun small build that you can enjoy. This review will be slightly shorter than you might expect, however I felt it important to go into all the details without using the pro/con style as this little set deserves indepth discussion rather than point form comments. Read on and find out my thoughts on this set.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: The boxes designed for the Legend Beasts are new smaller sized boxes, a first for the Chima Theme as most sets before this were in larger boxes. The design draws your eye on the shelf, it&rsquo;s a fun little box with some impressive pictures for the set. The Legend Beast title draws your attention to the box.</p>

<p>On the back you&rsquo;ll find cross-promotional images of the remaining four beasts and explains that there&rsquo;s an online game you can access from the App Store. (A code is included to unlock the beast in-game on your App on a thick stock card. Which is designed to be scanned by your smartphone.)</p>

<p>Instructions: Simple instruction manual for this set; it&rsquo;s easy to follow and has cross-promotional images of the rest of the early 2014 line. It does not include the checklist of minifigures you&rsquo;ll find in larger sets, however here I can forgive this as there are only so many pages. The manual comes folded in the box and it is a small box so creases and damage are a risk you may run into depending on how it was packaged. The included sticker sheet for the details may or may not suffer a similar fate, you won&rsquo;t know until you open the box to find out.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set includes a lot of useful parts for MOCing, especially if you want a decent number of the ball and socket mini-joints. Each Crocodile LB includes five of the new joints. Also some of the claw pieces in dark green and tan are there&hellip; Or are they teeth? Well their used for claws here.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Cragger is the only Mini-Figure included in this set and he&rsquo;s pretty impressive actually. You&rsquo;ll only find this particular version in this set, he has his double-sided torso, printed legs, double-sided facial print, unique print head piece and special golden Chi armor. He also has a transparent blue shield and a gold blade weapon with blue Lightsaber bar inside as accessories.</p>

<p>Cragger is a great looking mini-figure and you can&rsquo;t go wrong nabbing this set for him.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>As I mentioned above this build is pretty quick, it shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than 25 minutes max to finish the build. Probably less, the steps aren&rsquo;t too difficult and many of them are mirrored for the claws/feet and other areas like the mouth.</p>

<p>Using stickers for the numerous scale details instead of printed pieces is a bit of a disappointment though. The special printed croc eyes are nice though. I enjoy the build for the mouth a lot too, it&rsquo;s very intuitive and clever, and the hinged jaw is an excellent play feature.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This is a solidly designed brick-built animal. The new ball joints make for a nice treat, because it allows the crocodile to maneuver his limbs into different poses. With the hinge joint in the torso you can get a wide variety of mobility and display options for the model limited only by your imagination.</p>

<p>I love the design of all these legend beasts, they have a few minor issues, considering he&rsquo;s a belly dragger you do have some leeway in how you view the model. I do think it might have helped to include extra joints in the feet to make slightly longer legs, however that&rsquo;s where MOCing comes in. Still he looks pretty impressive and you&rsquo;re going to have some fun making awesome swimming poses for him. Also endless hours of fun opening and closing the jaw to bite down on enemies.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I strongly recommend the legend beasts, this one is a really fun little build and you&rsquo;re going to want him for the unique version of Cragger if you&rsquo;re collecting all the different versions of him. This also is a great parts pack and fairly cheap, so you can start building up a large collection of the new ball and socket joints as well as some decent dark green and medium green coloured pieces.</p>
