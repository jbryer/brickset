<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Normal Lego packaging, nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts selection here is amazing. It includes 9&nbsp;pairs of the small ball joints, which are extremely useful for building dragons, etc., as well as 5 2x2 curved slopes and 4 1x2 curved slopes. The face is actually printed on, but the rest of the details are stickers. It has a nice selection of white slopes in general, too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Worriz is okay (This not coming from a Chima fan). The trans-blue shield is interesting, and could be useful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Too short to be what I&#39;d call enjoyable, but it is interesting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Wolf is very poseable, and I could&nbsp;see KFOLs having fun with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great parts pack, and with 110 pieces for $9.99, it&#39;s a good deal.</p>

Legendary Beasts Unite.","<p><strong>Set #70127 Wolf Legend Beast: </strong>Time to discuss another legend beast, and this one is a true masterpiece&hellip; Though much like the lion has some limitations with the poseablity. Great little sets these legend beasts though, let&rsquo;s discuss the fine points now.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>As mentioned before the boxes have decent design elements and the artwork on the back showing the legend beast as seen on the show and the character included in the set is highly impressive. The smaller boxes are what they are there isn&rsquo;t much else to say about that.</p>

<p>The instructions show off the steps of the build fairly well, there are again a lot of stickers in this set for detail work and the sheet has no protection, but is small s chances of it being damaged during packaging is difficult to gauge. I&rsquo;d assume there isn&rsquo;t much of a chance of curled or mangled stickers though.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Naturally this set includes the new small ball joint connectors, great for fans of this piece. There are also six silver teeth parts and four of the tan triple-teeth parts&hellip; You know I should really look into the official names for some of these parts. Mixel parts basically are included in this set, great for MOCs and stuff.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Worriz: The lone minifigure in this set includes a double-sided torso, printed legs a double-sided face which is the same as other versions of Worriz and a golden shoulder armour for his Chi. He also has the transparent shield piece first introduced with the Gungans over in Star Wars, and a very curious weapon.</p>

<p>The weapon is designed using a gold Ninjago piece and that interesting ice-style part that looks like a lightning bolt forming a chain or something. It&rsquo;s a very strange weapon, but has some interesting potential and I kind of dig the look of it.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Again this build has some repetitive steps to it as the limbs are basically mirrored copies of one another. There are no issues with this build as far as difficult steps are concerned, it also wouldn&rsquo;t take more than a half hour to build tops depending on when you start and what you&rsquo;re doing while you&rsquo;re building. The design of this build is pretty interesting too, again though the printed elements are not used, except for the animal face so you&rsquo;ll be applying a lot of stickers for the detailing that just looks terrible.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This model is fun and pretty solid. There are two big flaws though, the tail likes popping off a lot and the ears are also notorious for falling off whenever you move the head to achieve any poses. The way the ears are attached isn&rsquo;t solid enough, so just turning the head side to side is going to have them fall off.</p>

<p>Also, while this model doesn&rsquo;t have knees just like the lion legend beast, the fact that the wolf is a lankier animal and can achieve better poses due to the leg designs I can forgive it a little bit more. What I can&rsquo;t forgive is the large number of stickers being used for detail here, the armour that is on the legs and paws is all stickers, stickers that are on a solid white background, which looks terrible on the white pieces that they&rsquo;re attached to. In this case LEGO should have just printed the detailing because white background stickers on white pieces just do not work.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I strongly recommend the legend beasts as parts pack and as sets, because you get a lot of decent parts in the sets for a small price. I also like the look of the legend beasts, even if they do have issues due to sticker details and limited joint design. Some I recommend more than others though, the Crocodile, Eagle and Wolf are my favorites so far with the lion being a bit less impressive. Admittedly not by much. I do still wish they&rsquo;d include a second minifigure for them to interact with considering the price point. 12.99$ LEGO city sets have 4 minifigures, 12.99$ Ninjago sets at least have a battle in a box. These are just disappointing, when it comes to the Minifigure count&hellip; Still worth picking up, but getting them on sale would be a better deal.</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-07-31T15:41:10.173Z","A great addition to the world of Chima!","<p>This set has brought me a lot of enjoyment over the years I&#39;ve had it. I really like robots or animals that can pose a lot. This set in particular is a big wolf with a posable head, posable legs, feet, tail and even the mouth! It looks really nice and because it can be moved so much, it is a lot of fun to play with! The minifigure also looks great with his wolf head, chest armor, and very good detailing on the torso and legs! This set was well worth the price!</p>

<p>If&nbsp;you like Legos, Chima or cool looking animals, I know you will like this set!</p>
