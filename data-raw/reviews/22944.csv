"Toby833","2014-08-01T20:47:01.953Z","All Future LEGO Helicopters Should Have This Mechanism!","<p>I recently picked this set up when my local LEGO Store had a 25% off Legends of Chima sets. I was debating about getting it over another set, but after the build I was very glad I made the purchase.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typical of most sets with warring factions, the front of the box shows an action scene between the good lion Lavertus (who pilots the Twin Blade) and the evil scorpion Scutter, while the&nbsp;back shows how to work the Twin Blade&#39;s rotor mechanism. Instructions were clear and easy-to-follow, with the color differences clearly defined and number of pieces per step limited to four or less.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Decent selection of dark yellow parts for such a small piece count set. I was really happy to see the inclusion of two universal joints (can&#39;t get enough of those!) and the six rotor pieces. I doubt that I could buy all the useful&nbsp;parts from this&nbsp;separately on Bricklink for less than I paid for this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t follow along with the mythos of this theme, so the figures weren&#39;t the highlight for me. Even still, I enjoyed the brick-built scorpion&#39;s lower half and helmet; I could definitely see some Predator-esque MOC uses for it. However,&nbsp;the lower half&nbsp;looks more mechanical than organic to me, which&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if&nbsp;it&#39;s intentional or not.&nbsp;I will say that the twin blasters of the lion are pretty neat; I like the use of the bar holders as the magazines.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple but effective. No new techniques that we haven&#39;t seen already. However, the designer has included a feature that I find ingenious. Using&nbsp;a gear&nbsp;that is allowed to slip, yet kept in place by a clip &amp; rubber band, they made&nbsp;a two-gear system that acts like a ratchet. By pressing down on a gear rack plate, the ratchet spins the vehicle&#39;s blades and allows the plate to be reset without slowing or reversing the blade&#39;s direction. The build overall ended up to be a pleasurable experience with no difficult placements or easily missed steps.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The vehicle stays together very well, with no loose or faulty areas. It sits stable of the table, with most of the weight centered between the front and middle of the vehicle. Probably not a display piece for most adults, but a perfect toy for children.</p>

<p>(Update: After messing around with the set a bit more, I did notice that the fins that make up the &quot;lion&#39;s mane&quot; of the Twin Blade come off very easily, especially when trying to put the pilot in the cockpit. Also, the confined space makes it difficult to attach the pilot&#39;s hands to the handlebars.)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve got to give the LEGO company credit. They made a fantastic swoosh-able helicopter that actually spins continuously in the same direction for as long as I want without having to touch the blades! I think that the mechanism itself is the reason to buy, or at least&nbsp;adapt from&nbsp;this set because this feature should be made a necessary one for any future manual rotor-based sets.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-13T17:59:46.45Z","Mediocre Model, Impressive Minifigures.","<p><strong>Set #70129 Lavertus&rsquo; Twin Blade: </strong>The spring wave of 2014 for Legends of Chima introduced the new evil tribes, based on creepy crawlies and the dark looking animals of the world. But you&rsquo;ll still find the tribes of Chima working to defend their Chi from these animal tribes with crazy off the wall looking vehicle designs.</p>

<p>When it comes to the Twin Blade I&rsquo;m a bit torn, the design isn&rsquo;t terrible, unfortunately it does look very awkward looking. Let&rsquo;s discuss the set in greater detail and you can see why I&rsquo;m not as thrilled with it as other vehicles I&rsquo;ve picked up.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: Typical Legends of Chima box design here, nothing really changes yet, not until the summer 2014 wave would LEGO modify the designs. So really the only thing to say is that I do enjoy this box design and like the look of it on the shelf.</p>

<p>Instructions: This set has a pretty good instruction manual. No numbered bags this time so it&rsquo;s step-by-step instructions for the entire contents. Be sure to separate the parts so you can find them easier. This one has the checklist and cross-promotional ads all in the back, nothing breaking up the instructions this time. Decent functional design for this size set and as always I&rsquo;m a huge fan of checklists.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find a lot of yellow/orange pieces in this set, with some nice light brown soft rubbery bits and some nice propellers for the flying vehicle. Overall I&rsquo;d say the parts are semi-useful if you&rsquo;re looking for some decent parts. I almost forgot, you get some interesting looking technic holder pieces, I&rsquo;m not sure on the official names, just the number 4525904, these may be extremely useful for MOC fans.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re going to find one and a half minifigures in this set, one lion tribe member and a minifigure torso with other parts to make a scorpion known as Scutter.</p>

<p>Lavertus: The lion tribe member in this set is known as Lavertus, apparently a member of the tribe who was banished or something. He&rsquo;s the dark brown coloured member of the tribe with a double-sided torso print on a dark blue torso and white hands, he has leg printing and a double-sided face, plus the lion head piece.</p>

<p>His shoulder armour is gold instead of silver. I definitely enjoy the look of this lion and he&rsquo;s one of the big reasons for why I picked up this set along with Scutter. I am curious though about what kind of weapons he&rsquo;s using, because this lion is packing, he&rsquo;s got some kind of chi axe blade space gun energy launching thing. Two of them actually, really nice accessories.</p>

<p>Scutter: Possibly the leader of the scorpions as he has the most legs (six of them) and a large stinger, Scutter is interesting and unique plus has a great print. Unfortunately the fact that he doesn&rsquo;t include spare legs if you want him to look like a regular minifigure you&rsquo;re out of luck.</p>

<p>The head piece is a nice new piece which I&rsquo;m really glad LEGO made, it looks perfect for a new bug based Space Theme and is suitably menacing. His torso is double-printed and his face is a single sided print unfortunately. His weapon is a nifty looking sickle, hammer combination that can cause a lot of injury to the enemy and seems to include poison in it.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say this set features some decent minifigures, and is well worth the price alone for it.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>What can I say about the build in this set? There isn&rsquo;t much to it and I don&rsquo;t want to get into too much detail on the completed model here. That being said, the biggest problems in this build are the play gimmick feature and the fact that you&rsquo;re using a lot of stickers for details. I wouldn&rsquo;t call this a satisfying build; however it is different and interesting enough to keep your attention and it does a good job of adding to the lion tribe vehicles.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Twin Blade is a massive oddity, and may also be a huge disappointment compared to the large lion tribe vehicles from 2013. Honestly I was more of a fan of the minifigures in this set, the vehicle model is a great play vehicle. It has a nice spinning propeller gimmick and there&rsquo;s a massive handle hanging out of the back so you can hold it. The design unfortunately is just a bit lackluster.</p>

<p>First of all it&rsquo;s open, by which I mean that there are no closed in cockpit areas, the controls are just open and Lavertus is the only one who can fit, he can&rsquo;t take any passengers. Secondly you have this huge thing sticking up in the back to trigger the play feature, this makes the design less functional aerodynamically and just looks like a glorified toy.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;m saying this, but there are no flick-fire missiles, so the vehicle has no functional weapons to attack Scutter and protect the Chi. Ordinarily flick-fire missiles are not wanted, but here it definitely couldn&rsquo;t hurt. The vehicle still keeps the tradition of looking like a lion inspired creature, I kind of wish there were some claws though, it might beef up the model and make it look more menacing.</p>

<p>Overall from this model I do find the gimmick fun and engaging, it&rsquo;s nice to spin the twin blades and I could lose myself in it for hours, but at the end of the day it&rsquo;s still a lukewarm model.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>So what do I say about this set? Mildly Recommended, the minifigures make up for a limited and less than impressive final model. I&rsquo;m really not a huge fan of the lion tribe vehicles; however I am a fan of this Theme&rsquo;s minifigures and this set is the only way to get Scutter so I picked it up. Some of the other lion tribe sets might be better, like Lavertus&rsquo; Outland Base, unless you&rsquo;d prefer to just Bricklink Scutter you&rsquo;re going to need to pick up this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still if you&rsquo;re a fan of these oddly proportioned Lion Tribe vehicle builds than I say you&rsquo;re tastes will make you love this set. So definitely enjoy.</p>

<p>Pieces: 183</p>

<p>Release Year: 2014</p>

<p>Price: US $19.99</p>

<h3><u><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></u></h3>

<p>The box is a standardish size for a LEGO $20 set. That being said the graphics on the box are great. The front shows a great action shot of Lavertus in the Twin Blade and Scutter. The graphics on all of the Chima sets are outstanding and this just fits the expectations. The back of the box shows some of the features of the set, such as the dual spinning blades.</p>

<p>The instructions are typical LEGO instructions that have great graphics, easy to follow steps, and plenty of cool pictures at the end showing off the sets playability.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 the box and instructions are standard LEGO quality.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Parts</strong></u></h3>

<p>This set has a nice blend of traditional LEGO system blocks and technic parts used in making the spinning blades. The main unique pieces that I could tell were the yellow slopes used to make the vehicle appear from the lion tribe and the grey blades used. The set still has a great selection of pieces.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 good pieces that can be used in alot of MOCs and side projects if needed</p>

<h3><u><strong>Minifigures</strong></u></h3>

<p>This was the main draw to the set for me. The appearance of Lavertus and Scutter in this set is really unique.</p>

<p>Lavertus: Appears in one other, yet this is unique in this set in that he has the pearl gold armor with him. Also the other set is a large $60 set, so getting him in a $20 is alot better. The detail on Lavertus is amazing. First off all Chima minifigs have immense detail. However with Lavertus it is really cool to look at the detail in his printed armor. The artists gave him tattered armor since in the story he was exiled alone in the jungle. His armor shows years of use, which is really cool. They didn&#39;t just give him a copy of the other lion tribes armor, but made his unique. Also another cool part is Lavertus&#39; fur color is a darker brown than all other lions in the tribe thus far. Great minifigure by itself. Also comes with two pretty sweet guns.</p>

<p>Scutter: Only appears in this set. He technically is half a minifigure as he doesn&#39;t have traditional legs, but has &#39;scorpion&#39; legs. The upper half of his body has great detail, as mentioned above with all Chima. I also really enjoy the look of the scorpion helmets. LEGO did a fantastic job of making him look like a scorpion while being able to make it fit on the traditional minifigure head. It would have been alot easier to make a new head mold all-together. The lower half is also really fantastic. Now some of the pieces may not be considered unique to some, but the leg parts definitely are. Scutter has great poseability with his legs and tail.</p>

<p>Overall: 5/5 a great accompaniment of minifigures that are unique enough to warrant a purchase of this set in itself.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Build</strong></u></h3>

<p>Building the &#39;helicpoter&#39; was very interesting. The only duplication is in the two blade sides. Other than that the build is fairly quick and straight-forward. Again, some technic pieces are used to allow the blades to move which add some fun to the build. Also a really cool method was used to keep the gears off of each other as the push-down bar reset as it comes up. I also really appreciate in all of the Chima sets how they make it a point to make the vehicles look like their tribe. It is also good to know that the lion face on the vehicle was made differently than all the other lion faces on the previous Lion tribe vehicles.</p>

<p>Stickers: This set does come with a small sheet of stickers that are placed in numerous areas around the build. The stickers have mostly blue printing with some transparent areas as well. They overall add some chi coloring and mechanical flavor to the build. The hardest part is getting the 6 small stickers onto the blade edges for the rotors.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 some new techniques along with some technic parts make for a fun build</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Completed Model</strong></u></h3>

<p>Definite swooshability, which you would not expect from the Lion tribe as lion&#39;s don&#39;t fly. It also looks odd and matches up with the story in that Lavertus created the first lion flying vehicle while exiled in the jungle. He obviously had random and spare parts so the overall look goes along with the story. The ability to push down the bar and make the blades spin is a really cool feature in the set that will make many a young LEGO fans love this set. The one concern to the set is the limited space for Lavertus to be able to sit in the cockpit, but he fits.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 great looking set that has the ability to play great as well</p>

<h3><u><strong>Price</strong></u></h3>

<p>Price for this set is US $19.99. Piece count is 183 with 2 minifigures.</p>

<p>Price-per-piece: $0.109. This is just above the $0.10 benchmark that I hold for all sets (personal preference). With Chima being a LEGO owned theme, most sets are under that mark, but obviously not all. However this set still fairs very well against alot of licensed themes that have higher price tags for their piece amounts.</p>

<p>Counting in Minifigures: 1 Minifigure (6 pieces)(legs, torso, head, helmet, armor, and chi) and 1 Minifigure(23 pieces)(torse, head, helmet, and 20 pieces for the legs/tail part). I count a minifigure at $3.00. Thus the rest of the set would come out to $13.99 at 154 pieces. Price-per-piece: $0.091 which is great considering the two minifigures you receive.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 great minifigures for the price, but it still fall above the $0.10 mark and why the deduction.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></u></h3>

<p>Overall the set is great for $20. Agreeably it could have been more intricate with a higher piece count, but that can be said of generally any set. I think the set is worth it alone for the two minifigures included in it. I would highly recommend the set to any KFOL for swooshability and the fact that the minifigures are two animals. I would also recommend to any AFOL looking for a great looking set that has more of an odd look to it. It definitely doesn&#39;t look like anything else.</p>

<p>Overall: 4.17/5 Great minifigures and a decent model</p>
",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Shib","2014-06-19T11:26:38.873Z","One For Play, Not Display","<p>Thanks to combining offers I was able to get this set for just under half the RRP, which is definitely a good price, especially for the minifigures.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art is fine, fairly standard to the Chima brand and the photo has certainly got the best possible angle of the finished model. No real complaints about the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of orangey yellow pieces that could certainly be useful, particularly for aircraft builds. A few nice trans blue pieces, most interestingly a couple of axe&nbsp;heads, these could be very useful as ice axes for fantasy themed MOCs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In all honesty the Minifigures were the main reason I wanted this set. I love fantasy MOCs and Scutter, the half brick built figure is a brilliant creature to use for that. Lavertus&nbsp;in my eyes is little different to any of the other Lion tribe characters, except a darker colour - I was however a little disappointed that his weapons are guns, feels a little out of place in the Chima&nbsp;theme, a crossbow would have been better.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing terribly exciting about the build of this, however for children I think it would be great. The propellers move by pushing a brick trigger on the back via the use of technic built gears, for a child wanting thinking if moving on to technic building this is an ideal tester. I did really enjoy putting the Scutter figure together, and that has made me want to get 70133 for the Spinlyn figure who is similarly built.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As other reviewers have pointed out the finished article doesn&#39;t look great, there&#39;s definitely&nbsp;something missing. This unfinished look could have been avoided with some landing feet.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This isn&#39;t a bad set but the focus is definitely on playability, if you have a child who loves swooshing their spaceships they&#39;ll almost certainly love the spinning blades. The minifigures&nbsp;are potentially very useful for display pieces, but if you want something to look nice on the shelf, look elsewhere.</p>
