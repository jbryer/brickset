<p>LEGO: Legends of Chima: 70130 Sparratus&#39; Spider Stalker</p>

<p>Pieces: 292</p>

<p>Release Year: 2014</p>

<p>Price: US $24.99</p>

<h3><u><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></u></h3>

<p>The box is normal for a set in the $20 - $25 price range. The box has great pictures of the action shot on the front and some of the play features on the back.</p>

<p>The instructions are standard LEGO quality. Great rendered images that are clear and simple enough for the younger builders.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 Great quality, as usual.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Parts</strong></u></h3>

<p>The set comes with a decent selection of some dark brown pieces. There are also a few of the yellow-green bricks throughout the model as well. There is one piece that only appears in this set and that is the silver axe head that Sparratus carries, all other ones have been gold up to this point. The other pieces that are found in only one other set are the spider web green discs that are on the missiles to be launched.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5. Nothing that stands out but not a bad selection.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Minifigures</strong></u></h3>

<p>Like most Chima sets the minifigures are the draw for me.</p>

<p>Gorzan: Appears in nine total sets, and shows up as he does here with his heavy armor again only in the Speedor set that he is in. He does have the special silver/gray torso piece with the outlands armor. Thus he is a unique figure in that sense. But Chima figures have great detail and are superb minifigures.</p>

<p>Sparratus: Shows up in four total sets and in all of them he is the same. Thus he is not by any means a unique figure to this set, but since the spider tribe is so limited to the amount of numbers of figures in the tribe, why not have more spiders? The minifigure is a great one and the helmet piece is a great one with the fangs and eye details looking amazing.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 Great minifigures as expected from the Chima line, but not any that really standout as rare.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Build</strong></u></h3>

<p>The build is not overly difficult. It is fairly straight forwards and it melds traditional system LEGO and technic pieces together well. The worst part of the build is building the eight spider legs. It is very repetitive as four of the legs are exact copies of one another. However I will say that I am highly pleased that they went with eight legs. To many times in the past they have gone with six and thus does not feel like a true spider. I&#39;m glad they went with eight legs, but the build is very repetitive due to that fact.</p>

<p>Stickers: The set comes with a few stickers. The biggest disappointment is another sticker control panel that must be applied for the vehicle. I am not a fan of sticker control panels.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 giving the four due to the eight legs and being very appropriate for the build.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Completed Model</strong></u></h3>

<p>The completed vehicle looks great. Again the eight legs makes it feel like it is an actual spider vehicle. The eyes for the vehicle and fangs add to the entire feel of the model as well. The only issue I have with the model as a whole is the back section with the flick-fire missiles. It is designed to be on a pivot so it can come up and down for shooting, yet it doesn&#39;t look right, to me, in its rest state.</p>

<p>The model has great playability as the front legs on either side can go up and down with the gear-box and knob on the back. The addition of the flick-fire missiles makes for some great fun. The model also looks great since alot of care was taken in designing to the model to look like a spider. I think they excelled at this and it looks great.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 Great model that can be put on a shelf or played with.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Price</strong></u></h3>

<p>Price for this set is US $24.99. Piece count is 292 with 2 minifigures.</p>

<p>Price-per-piece: $0.086. This is under my typical $0.10 benchmark I hold for all LEGO sets and is not a bad P/P ratio in the Chima line. The fact that Chima is LEGO owned and not licensed helps keep the P/P down. Thus this set is at shelf price a decent buy.</p>

<p>Counting in Minifigures: One Minifigure at four pieces (head, helmet, torso, and legs) and one minifigure at six pieces (head, helmet, torso, legs, breast-plate, and chi). I count a minifigure at $3.00. Thus the rest of the set would come out to $218.99 at 282 pieces. Price-per-piece: $0.067 which is great in any case.</p>

<p>Overall: 5/5 great P/P from the Chima line.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></u></h3>

<p>This set is a great one to pick up. The minifigures are great, but not ones that are only in this set. However it makes for a great shelf piece or one to play with.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 A decent set for a great price.</p>
