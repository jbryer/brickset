<p>AWESOME! Scorm is the best though. Laval and Cragger&nbsp;are really good too. The Korroders&nbsp;are Amazing! &nbsp;5/5!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very fun, unlike any other set! 5/5!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

"brickman3","2014-12-20T16:08:03.24Z","Out of my way, heroes!","<p>This set is one of my favorites Chima sets. It comes with the all-exclusive Scorm, who of which is the king of the Scorpion tribe. He has special scorpion gold armor, which give him his stinger.&nbsp;Next there is the heroic Laval, prince of the Lion tribe. He comes in heavy silver armor, a jetpack, his new sword from his uncle, Lavertus, Black Valious, and a Chi shield. Finally, there is Cragger, the prince of the Crocodile tribe. He comes with heavy silver armor, and a giant blaster that I use sometimes as a jetpack for him. Now, for the pros and cons of the set.</p>

</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>more scorpions?</li>
	<li>claws don&#39;t move very well.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the two cons, I love this set!</p>
