"LegoCollector46","2009-08-16T20:16:21.64Z","""Give Me The Stone!""","This set isn't the greatest, but it's not the worst. It comes with a regular Harry, but it also comes with Professor Quirrell who is only in this set. The sticker is pretty neat, if you look at it from one angle, it shows Harry. If you look at it from a different angle, it shows Harry holding the Sorcerer's/Phillosopher's stone. If you turn what the sticker is on around it reveals the S/P stone.

Another scene based lego set from the movies featuring the usual players. Impossible to complain about Harry's or Quirrel presence in the set or to expect any other figures. 

The small room is solid and features a nice green roof section, the black bat and owl are a mystery to me but remain connected to the theme of Harry Potter unlike the massive orange spider. 

The often praised mirror/ revolving door is a nice touch and saves this set from a lower rating. A solid three stars, one for the collectors only.

Pros
Rare minifig in Quirrel with two sided head.
Nice sticker/hologram.

Cons
Pointless additions, like the bat and owl and spider......
Its almost too small to play with, this set should have been more along the lines of graveyard duel in terms of size.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-14T12:46:43.11Z","LEGO Harry Potter - The Final Challenge Review","This set is the first and only LEGO set with a professor Quirrell. This model is an easy built and fun to play with. I like the idea how LEGO did the mirror with the sticker where you can see Harry Potter and if you move this picture you'll see Harry with the gem which is just like in the movie. The building is very sturdy and we get a sviwel mirror where you can see the translucent red gem on the back as a real LEGO piece. We also get Harry Potter who comes in lot's of other LEGO Harry Potter sets and professor Quirrell with a printing on the back of his head which shows you Lord Voldemort. I can't complain about this set and it's a good model to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"BobaFett2","2011-01-19T13:34:14.097Z","Juniorized but decent","<p>Most of the Harry Potter sets were very juniorized. This one was no exception.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Harry and Quirrell are ""facing off"" outside of the room.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>You get a lot of arches from this set, although I don't know why. The set includes a bat, a black owl, and a spider-odd, but it's a nice touch. Of course there's the Mirror of Erised-a rotating door with a holographic image applied on one side. It's a very nice piece, fitting perfectly into the story. Other notable parts include the sand green roof and spider web.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The Harry is Harry-nothing special about him. Not great, but not bad. Quirrell, on the other hand, is quite a gem. He has a purple turban and a black cloak, as well as a great purple suit. The best part is his head-it's double sided, with one side being the totally evil face of Voldemort (the best ever in my opinion) and the other being the face of Quirrell.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Ugh. It's extremely juniorized, so it's just stacking.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Very simple, but fun to play with. It looks pretty nice, and the mirror ads for a lot of playability. There's a gem on the other side, so you can flip it to give Harry the Sorcerer's (Philosopher's in England) Stone.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a nice little set, if a bit expensive. It was too juniorized, but a good way to get Voldemort and a few rare parts. This is worth buying to add to your Harry Potter collection, and the mirror is the best part.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-05T15:10:00.887Z","The Mirror of Erised","<p>Set #4702 The Final Challenge: I know I probably misspelled that, but that's basically what this set is. A large archway with the mirror and a roof, but it's a fairly decent little set from the first batch of Harry Potter Themed LEGO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Final Challenge as a whole is a simple model to build, it includes a sticker to use for the mirror details which is one of those types that can switch between one image and the next when angled just right. (I have no idea what they are officially called.) The model is designed to become interlocked with the rest of Year One Harry Potter sets to build up Hogwarts Castle. This feature was relatively ambitious, but also somewhat lacking in certain areas due to the nature of some of the smaller sets, there weren't enough walls and some of them (Troll on the Loose/Sorting Hat) had no roof, but were meant to go on the bottom of a certain set. Very strange that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set features a few must have items and a few typical items from the Harry Potter Theme. First of all, you get Professor Quirrel and this is the only set to have this rare figure. Quirrel has a double-sided head to showcase his possessed-by-Lord-Voldemort nature. He also has a rare purple colored turban. Harry is the standard Yellow Faced Harry available in pretty much every single HP Set from that era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Animal wise you get a black bat, a black owl and a transparent orange spider. (A rather unusual color for an arachnid, don't you think?) Accessory wise, there are two cloth capes in black (with I believe stars printed on the inside), Harry's magic wand, and two Philosopher's Stones. (Ruby Red Jewels, one of them was an extra, the other could be placed behind the mirror which was on a revolving piece for playability.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that The Final Challenge is one of the sets you really can't do without in your HP collection. Especially if you want a Professor Quirrel. I recommend this one to HP Fans, and, in spite of certain odd choices for builds I think these earlier sets have a lot of great MOCing potential.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"HarryPotterLegoCollector","2020-10-05T14:30:04.647Z","Quirrell figure is the best bit!","<p>I find this set lacks the feel for a &#39;dangerous&#39; situation. I think if it was more a hall with steps surrounding, a freestanding mirror of Erised and lots more flames it would make it SO much more appealing.</p>

<p>Pro:</p>

<p>- The double-sided Quirrell/ Voldemort&nbsp;head&nbsp;</p>

<p>- The Mirror of Erised sticker</p>

<p>- The Philosophers/Sorcerers Stone (red Lego gem)</p>

<p>- Professor Quirrell figure is unique to this set!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- It&#39;s a small set</p>

<p>- There are not enough flames</p>

<p>- There&#39;s no instant wow factor (other than the Quirrell figure)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t for Professor Quirrell this set wouldn&#39;t be value for money.&nbsp;</p>
