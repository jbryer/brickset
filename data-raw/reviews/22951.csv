<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a new design for 2014, it is much easier to open than the previous packaging.</p>

<p>The Instructions for Building the model is 23 pages long, with another few pages showing how to play the game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are very good, you get four of the new wing pieces,a New Bat head piece,11 CHI crystals , A purple Speedor and A purple ripcord.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The Minifigure&nbsp;is Blista, and he is a great Minifigure&nbsp;with fantastic printing.</p>

<p>Blista&#39;s&nbsp;Torso has printing on both sides, the front of his Torso has a Bat symbol on it, he also has some Chains printed on his Torso on both sides, his Wings attach to the back of his armour, just like the way the Eagles and the Ravens wings are attached.</p>

<p>His legs are printed with fur on them, Blista&#39;s head is not double sided unlike all of last years Chima&nbsp;Minfigures, the new Bat head piece, is nice and has a smile, he also has quite a big nose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is quite simple, like most Speedor&nbsp;sets,there really isn&#39;t much to say.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Complete model is actually very nice &nbsp;and the obstacle is made to look like a Bat. The Speedor&nbsp;has some really nice detail, and is the same mold as the Wolves Speedorz&nbsp;and you get five CHI pins to knock over.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how to play the game:</p>

<p>You set up your Bat obstacle and put the ramp on the front of it, then set up the CHI pins, then pull your Speedorz rip cord and sit it at the front of the ramp, your Speedor&nbsp;goes up the ramp, over the Bat obstacle and knock over the CHI pins.</p>

<p>Then your opponent Plays, the Person to knock over the most pins is the</p>

<p>One who picks the first score on there card, for each time you beat your opponents score you get Two CHI Crystals, the first Person to get six CHI Crystals is the Winner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set , definitely worth the money for the New Parts and Minifigure.</p>
