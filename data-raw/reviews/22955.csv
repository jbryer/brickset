<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is nice, it has some neat art showing off the swamp speeder, all 4 clones (The 41st elite troopers, and the Kashyyyk troopers) one of which is sort of wandering around without his new blaster. It has an image of Darth Vader in the upper right hand corner, replacing Yoda from last year. Very nice, and appealing box.<br />
The instructions are like any other instruction booklet. The front is a copy image of the box cover, and we have the overly excited WIN! kid on the back. We have right away that warning, telling us not to shoot the new blasters at your eye, and how to put a minifig together. Then we get in to the actual instructions. 26 pages, and about 19 major steps. Everything is pretty simple, no complicated building processes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only new parts, from what I can tell, are the blasters and the 41st elite corp trooper helmet. I&#39;ll get in to the new body parts later. The blasters, from what I can tell, are only going to be sold in battle packs, which isn&#39;t as bad as I first thought. Lego definitely got it right with the 2nd wave of blasters, and these just look bad. It&#39;s kind of cool how they actually fire,and how they sort of resemble the old megaphone blasters, but I still think they&#39;re stupid. Like flick-fire missiles. Kids will think it&#39;s great, but AFOL won&#39;t.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Now to the hole reason anyone buys this set. The minifigures. They are awesome. Brand new skins on them. Different for the 41st and the regular troopers. The 41st helmets are similar, but not exactly the same as the ARF trooper from 2012. The ARF troopers helmet was more pointed, and these are more flat on the top. Also the positioning of the eye&#39;s looks a little high, but that doesn&#39;t matter to me. The troopers are the selling point of this set. The only downside is that all the clones have the exact same face.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not as satisfying as other sets, but that wasn&#39;t the reason for picking this one up. This one, for me, is strictly an army builder. The build is pretty simple. Nothing complicated at all.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a cool smaller version of 8091: Republic Swamp Speeder. The clones sit nicely in it, and you can attach the blasters to the front.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a very good army builder set, and the swamp speeder is alright. A cool thing you can do is, if you have Commander Gree from the AT-AP, and a yoda (from anything) you can take a 41st clone and re-create the order 66 scene from Ep.III, where Yoda cuts off Gree and a 41st&nbsp;clone&#39;s heads.&nbsp;<br />
Great army builder, 9/10. I would give it 10/10, but I can&#39;t stand the blasters.&nbsp;</p>

"rancorbait","2014-03-08T13:50:25.323Z","75035 Kashyyyk Troopers","<p>This year we see the release of three battle packs instead of the usual two, this set, pushing 1st place for me with battle packs this year, is, in my opinion, one of the best Star Wars battle packs ever as it not only has great figures but a great model as well. And of course, being a battle pack, it is quite affordable too. Lets get on to the review...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll start with my favorite two minifigures, the&nbsp;<strong>41st&nbsp;Elite Corps troopers</strong>: I have been waiting for LEGO to re-release these figures for years, and now they&#39;re finally here, and they don&#39;t disappoint! The new olive green helmet has camouflage printed on the front and sides, as well as a green visor and the helmet&#39;s breath filters etc. The heads (on all four figures) is the same as all the other clones as of 2013, with a determined, teeth baring expression. The torso is again, olive green, as are the arms. the torso has very detailed camouflaged armor and storage pouches printed on the front, with similar details on the back. The dark brown legs feature printed knee guards and straps that go extend from the thighs to the bottom of the torso.</p>

<p>Now for the&nbsp;<strong>41st Kashyyyk troopers</strong>: Strangely enough, these troopers never actually appeared in the film, hence the name &#39;Kashyyyk troopers&#39; but its great to get these figures anyway! The helmets are again, olive green, with camouflage and a green visor printed on. The torso is also olive green, with armor printed of the front and back, the arms however, are dark tan, as are the legs, which have knee and thigh armor printed on them. All in all, even thought its a non-canon character its still a great addition any clone army!</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build is quite brief, as is expected with a set of this size, it only takes maybe 10 minutes to complete. While it is fairly basic the model does make use of clips and technic pins etc to hold it together, which is always nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The completed model looks very nice and is quite accurate as far as I can tell. While many battle pack&#39;s models are not particularly interesting or useful, but this one is perfect for army building as it is small yet accurate, and it doesn&#39;t look awkward if you have more than one. The speeder comfortably seats two minifigures, and their blasters can be conveniently stored on the front of the speeder providing it with moveable weapons while in use. Overall its a nice accurate representation if the ISP&#39;s (Infantry Support Platforms) from episode III. Something that seems to be receiving&nbsp;a lot of negativity&nbsp;is the new blasters. While they are very interesting blasters I&#39;m not sure that they belong with Star Wars sets, however, I&#39;m glad that we get some in this set as they work quite well actually. I think they will definitely appeal &nbsp;to younger kids though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This set is definitely one of my favorite sets of the 2014 winter wave, due to the amazingly detailed minifigures, nice accurate Swamp speeder, and affordable price. If you want a good army builder/battle pack that will provide you with great figures as well as a great model this is the ideal set!&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T14:53:47.25Z","Clones of Kashyyyk","<p><strong>Set #75035 Kashyyyk Troopers: </strong>2014 Battle Packs offer up the least amount of builds yet, this set only has 99 pieces and that includes the minifigure pieces. Battle Packs were never that piece heavy or impressive honestly, but still they used to offer up better builds. In this batch the strongest build is actually in this set, and the weakest was in my previous review of Utapau Troopers. Read on and find out why this set get&rsquo;s my vote as best of the bunch for builds.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>What can I say here? It&rsquo;s a nice box design which showcases the set effectively and the instructions for the set are decent, also you get a minifigure and first wave set checklist in the back which helps to keep track of who you have and who you need.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>With only 99 pieces in this set there isn&rsquo;t much to say. However you&rsquo;ll find a unique unprinted R5 Astromech head in this set for custom fans and 6 clear plastic 4278412 parts which some might find useful. I have no idea what the technical term is, I want to say round smooth plates&hellip; Anyway not a lot here, however it&rsquo;s decently serviceable as a parts pack.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Four minifigures is standard these days for battle packs. And in this set you get some really good ones. There are two 41<sup>st</sup> Elite Corps troopers and 2 41<sup>st</sup> Kashyyyk Troopers. These Clones are all in forest camo colours and carry the new stud launcher blasters. Really unfortunate that we don&rsquo;t have ordinary blasters anymore in these sets, the stud launchers are nice, unfortunately they aren&rsquo;t really screen accurate.</p>

<p>41<sup>st</sup> Kashyyyk Troopers: Both have identical prints, leg printing, double-sided torsos and printed new style phase 2 helmets. Fantastic new prints on these clones recently LEGO has really gone all out with these&hellip; not much more to say about them.</p>

<p>41<sup>st</sup> Elite Corps Troopers: Again some lovely prints, leg printing, double-sided torsos reminiscent of the Scout Troopers and I believe some new helmets with loads of printing. At least they look new to me, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;ve seen them before.</p>

<p>Overall some great army builders here&hellip; Although I&rsquo;m not sure if the designation is correct, weren&rsquo;t the 41<sup>st</sup> clones supposed to be on Coruscant at the end? Eh, no biggie I guess.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build in this set is fairly simple, considering it&rsquo;s only one thing you&rsquo;re building and doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of steps or pieces. It&rsquo;s a fast and easy build that will allow you to have a finished model to play with in no time; not much else to say about it at this point.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a two-seater Republic Swamp Speeder kind of vehicle that you build. It looks pretty impressive actually, a compact fun little vehicle that can fit two Mini-Figures, has spaces to hold two of the stud launchers when not in use and you can attach the spare ammo in front. The colour scheme isn&rsquo;t very camo, it would stick out on the jungle planet of Kashyyyk rather easily since it&rsquo;s mostly grey with a few maroon/red pieces.</p>

<p>Much improved over the limited parts count that is the Tri-Droid from Utapau.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a great battle pack, the four mini-figures and the main build are really solid and I strongly recommend picking up two or three of this set alone for a Kashyyyk diorama if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing. Just getting tons of these troopers alone is well worth it.</p>

"123MrBrick","2014-10-09T03:36:22.553Z","Great for Army Building!","<p>While this set is not the best when it comes to price per piece, you will not regret picking this up, especially since you get two exclusive figures!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the new 2014 battle pack size. The front shows the Kashyyyk troopers showing off and shooting at nothing in particular. The back shows the features of the swamp speeder, as well as a few cinematic shots and the &#39;blueprints&#39; that have been on recent Star Wars sets. The instruction manual comes folded in half and is rather small. I had no problems following the steps and there were no errors.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts included are fairly common, but there are some newer pieces including: the R5 style droid dome, the new blasters, and the clips that hold on the blasters when the clones are seated.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes two 41st Elite troopers.&nbsp; These two are an update on the figure included with the original Clone Turbo Tank and have amazingly detailed camoflauge printing. I was really impressed by the white splotches that were put on the helmets.&nbsp; It is this little attention to detail that really makes me love these figures.&nbsp; The other two figures are the &#39;Kashyyyk clones&#39;, which LEGO has made up for the sake of variety. Nevertheless, they still look great alongside their &#39;real&#39; bretheren, and share the same attention to detail. All four clones share the face introduced a while back.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set takes about 10 minutes, because a lot of the part count is eaten up by the figures and extra blaster bolts. There was nothing particularly challenging about the build, even though some Technic is used.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed speeder looks great on its own or with other clone vehicles. The clones are easily seated at the controls, and the blasters always fire. I recommend using this set alongside <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8091-1/Republic-Swamp-Speeder"">8091</a> for the most action.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set has great minifigs and a fun speeder, but it is more for prequel fans. Adding more of the new Kashyyyk sets only increases the fun.</p>
",TRUE,5,3,3,4,5
"PooPotato","2014-04-02T22:33:14.027Z","Kashyyyk Troopers","<p>When I saw the preliminary photographs for this set, I had one thought on my mind: finally, we get a new clone battlepack without any &quot;useless&quot; clones (who wants an army of bomb squad troopers?). &nbsp;The new scout helmets looked great, but I thought to myself &quot;what were those weird new blasters they are holding?&quot;</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box is average, along with the instruction booklet.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>There are many useful parts included with this set, including rare dark red elements and a light grey astromech&nbsp;head for the back of the turbine. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigures are of course the main reason anybody would buy this set, so I&#39;ll talk about them in more detail.</p>

<p>Two new 41st&nbsp;Elite Corps Scout troopers are included,and are a welcome addition considering the last and only appearance of this trooper was in 2005. &nbsp;The new helmet molding looks awesome, and the camouflage printing is extraordinary. &nbsp;It is great that this set comes with 2 of these guys, making it so much easier to build an accurate recreation of the Episode III Battle of Kashyyyk.</p>

<p>Also included are the never before seen 41st Kashyyyk&nbsp;Clone Troopers. &nbsp;Although these guys never made an appearance in the film, they look awesome next to the scouts, and have wonderful camouflage printing on their helmets and torso. &nbsp;The green The new Phase II helmet is also an improvement over the open visor version last seen during the first Episode III line, allowing all troopers to have a face.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>Unlike most battlepacks&nbsp;where I despise the mini-model that comes with it, I happen to think very highly of the swamp-speeder that this set contains. &nbsp;Not only is this vehicle canon, but it is accurately scaled, has a wonderful turbine that can turn, and it easily slides around like it is hovering. &nbsp;The only inaccuracy would be that the two forward guns have 2 barrels, but this could easily be modified to look more accurate. &nbsp;I find that the 41st scouts look better piloting this vehicle than the standard infantry guys.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The overall model looks fantastic next to the original AT-AP (once I finish the final purchase of the Episode II line, I plan to purchase the new AT-AP and I&#39;ll be able to compare it to the old one!), and will hopefully look nice next to the new one and the Droid Gunship in the near future. &nbsp;One thing I must say is that I do not care for the new blasters at all. &nbsp;They look incredibly cartoonish on the minifigs, but don&#39;t look too bad on the speeder. I quickly replaced these new blasters with the old ones, which in my opinion look fantastic and should not be changed anytime soon.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>I have to say this is the best battlepack I have ever purchased, due to the wonderful movie-accurate model and the four new trooper minifigures. &nbsp;The awesome swamp-speeder gives it a better rating than 75036&nbsp;Utapau Troopers which has a clunky and useless model. &nbsp;I am glad that Lego has went back to the standard 4 minifig battlepack, as I never had a use for an army of Droidekas or Commando Droids (set #&#39;s 75000 and 9488).</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>4 new and awesome minifigures</p>

<p>Great looking model, movie accurate too</p>

<p>New helmet designs are far better than their predecessors</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>New blasters look incredibly cartoonish</p>

<p>Price a little high at $13, (I miss the days when they were $10)</p>

"Tar_Domo","2014-09-01T14:26:15.94Z","A Nice Add To Kashyyyk Theme","<p>Kashyyyk was one of the winter 2014 LEGO SW themes. Other sets with Kashyyk theme released in winter 2014 are Droid gunship and&nbsp;AT-AP.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box was the standard battle pack size. Instructions were good so nothing special to say here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This does not come with a lot exlusive parts. There is not very good pieces for MOCs but the pieces aren&acute;t still too bad.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This comes with 2 Kashyyk Troopers and 2 Scout Troopers. In my opinion the new design of the Scout Troopers is great. Kashyyyk Troopers are a good new thing. This may be your best chance to get Kashyyyk/Scout Trooper army for the Battle of Kashyyyk so if your interested about that I wouldn&acute;t think it could be a mistake to buy a few of these sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this was quite easy. It didn&acute;t took a lot of time, about the same time as building a microfighter.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a set for playing or for getting a Clone Army. It&acute;s not the best set for display, but goes with that also.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great battle pack.</p>

<p>Comes in small box. The dimensions of the box are 7.5 x 5.6 x 1.8 inches and weighs 0.26 pounds. Has a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t really have any cool or unique pieces. The maroon pieces are really nice to get. The total piece count is 99.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><b>Kashyyyk Clone Troopers:</b></p>

<p>These are some of my favorite clone troopers. The phase II Kashyyyk troopers are very well done. The detail on the helmets, torso and legs are great. The green in the visor is really nice. The armor on the torso is spot on and the printing on the legs is nice as well. I just hate the stud shooters they gave them. I wished they just would have given them a rifle or blaster liked they use to.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Kashyyyk Scout Troopers:</b></p>

<p>These Scout Troopers are decent. I am not a fan of their helmets. I prefer the older molds used in sets 7913 and 9488. The new molds aren&#39;t bad but I prefer the old ones. The detail on the helmet isn&#39;t bad and green on the visor is nice addition to the helmet. Their armor on the torso is really well done and the printing on the legs is also very good as well. Again I just hate the stud shooters given to them, and that they would have given them a rifle or blaster they used to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy and took less than 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this is great battle pack. The speeder is decent. I do wish they gave some sort of cannons or weapons on it (And I don&#39;t mean equipping the stud shooters on the front of it). The figures are great. My only problem is that I prefer the old scout trooper helmets to the new ones. Other than that these are great figures. I really like these Kashyyyk Clone Troopers and wish they would do more sets with them in it. I highly recommend getting this set. It is a great army builder. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

I&#39;m not going to lie. It&#39;s a pretty good set for army building and a cheap way to get the Kashyyyk Trooper minifigures for collectors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this set is also lacking in some aspects. The build, while it is good, is very limited on pieces. I felt it could have had more pieces, maybe for a second build, like in this year&#39;s Rebel Trooper Battle Pack. It is also sorely lacking in play features for playing out battle scenes, but it does have slider plates underneath so you can transport it around for battle, which is a nice addition, although nothing new.&nbsp;</p>

The Swamp Speeder is very movie accurate and makes good use of its few parts. Front panels can be angled down to give easy access to the two pilots. I like the rear of the speeder as it has a propeller that can be angled back and forth, to show which way the vehicle is propelled. The dark red and light grey colour scheme is attractive. At the front of the Speeder there is a place to put the pilots blasters. Smooth 2x2 domes underneath the vehicle let it glide easily when you push it. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
