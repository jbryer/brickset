"Packer_221","2022-07-19T19:05:04.947Z","A Great Army Builder","<p>I&#39;ve been waiting a long time for this set to come out in the U.S., and it finally came out in February. After purchasing the CAC&nbsp;Ep3&nbsp;Commander Cody, I wanted to be able to build him an army. Thus battle pack worked out perfectly. I received 3 of these for my B-day; my mom got them for BOGO&nbsp;50% off. It was originally retailing for 15 dollars each at Toys R Us.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Both the box and instructions are both what you would expect: small. The box artwork does not have a very effective setup, with ineffective placement of the minifigures. The box also features a spot where one would press their finger to open (and unfortunately destroy) the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Besides the troopers themselves, the parts include many click hinge beams which can occasionally be useful. The pieces also include a 4x4 dark tan dome, which, forgive me if I&#39;m wrong, is unique to the set. It also includes 4 of the new doing blasters, which are great for kids, but I had&nbsp;to order some DC-15 blasters and blaster riffles from CAC&nbsp;and Brickarms.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures, which are the highlight of the set, are probably the most detailed clone troopers Lego has ever produced along with the Kashyyyk troopers. You get in the set 2 regular and 2 airborne troopers of the 212th attack battalion. I&#39;ll start with the regular ones. They feature the same helmet mold&nbsp;as we saw in the Umbara wave in 2013. I have to say Lego did a pretty good job on the helmet mold.&nbsp;They are a little tall ad lack holes in the side for attachments, but the rest is fine. These particular troopers feature the distinctive 212th orange triangle decoration along with scuff marks here and there, which is a very nice inclusion. The head is the same seen on the ep2 clones Lego has released. I would just like to throw&nbsp;out that any clone trooper that has this head is from ep2 or ep3, not the Clone Wars TV show. I noticed Brickset listed the Battle of Saleucami under The Clone Wars, but it&nbsp;should be under Episode III. Anyway, moving on. The torso features nice printing, continuing the orange triangle and scuff pattern. The arms, unfortunately, don&#39;t sport any printing which is one of&nbsp;the major downsides to the set. He has black hands like all the other clones Lego has produced. Onto his legs. The legs continue the 212th pattern. It&#39;s nice to finally see Lego starting to make leg printing a priority for not only clones but for most figures in the Star Wars universe. Unfortunately, the printing ends halfway down the legs, only half completing the knee pads. On to the airborne trooper. The helmet mold is exclusive&nbsp;to this figure and is of the same quality as the other helmet. The printing on the helmet is exceptional and features the airborne troopers&#39; distinct two slanted orange stripes, also featured on the torso and left leg. The torso sports a few slings either holding ammo or attached&nbsp;to armor. Scuff marks are also present on the torso, along with the&nbsp;helmet and legs as well. The troop has one orange arm am one white arm, the orange arm representing a large orange shoulder pad on the right side. Lego was generous enough to include a light bluish grey kama, which shows attention to detail. The legs are similar to the other trooper, but include airborne trooper marks. Sorry this has been such a long section, but the figures are the most&nbsp;important part of the&nbsp;set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not very interesting. The actual Octupara droid itself is pretty repetitive with building three of the same legs. Building 4 (12 in my case) figures are also pretty tedious.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is pretty dull. I do not recommend&nbsp;using it in MOCs, as it is pretty inaccurate. There&#39;s really not much to say about it. If you&#39;re a part collector,&nbsp;the best thing to do would be to scrap it down for parts. I broke two of the Octupara&nbsp;droids and built a more accurate one out of them, and I was pleased with how it turned out.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Obviously, you will want to get this set for the figures, not the&nbsp;model. This specific selection of figures makes it one if the best army builders in a while. The thing that would make this set perfect would be the inclusion of a crab droid instead of an Octupara droid. This motivated me to go&nbsp;onto Bricklink and order a few parts to make my own, which turned out pretty good. Overall, this is a great battle pack for anyone into clone troopers or into collecting minifigures. It also offers an alternative&nbsp;to buying custom 212th attack battalion troopers online. Basically: it&#39;s a cheap way&nbsp;to buy cool clones.</p>

"Jon_Brick","2014-06-07T22:58:06.487Z","A throughly enjoyable set.","<p>Battle-packs have been around for a while now, almost eight years in fact and in those eight years some things have remained largely the same such as the piece count (averaging at about 83 pieces) and the number of figures included (only&nbsp;7654:&nbsp;Droids Battle Pack&nbsp;and&nbsp;8015:&nbsp;Assassin Droids Battle Pack&nbsp;didn&#39;t have exactly four minifigures instead having seven and five minifigures respectively), while on the other hand some&nbsp;things have changed such as improved design of the minifigures and the set overall, as well as a rise in price. Another thing that has changed with the battle-packs over time is the division of figures based which side they&#39;re on, for a while two sets were released each year both based on a certain peroid of time in the Star Wars universe but each focusing on one side of the opposing armies, then in 2012 the battle-packs merged sides (for example having either Clones vs. Droids or Rebels vs. The Empire in each set) and each set was based on a different time peroid and now in 2014 things have changed yet again by having battle-packs based around different points in the Star Wars timeline and by having some only contain clones or imperials while another has clones and a droid.Hopefully though the thing that will always remain the same about battle-packs is the quality since, for the most part, they have all been pretty good buy and even the worst one *cough* 8015: Assassin Droids Battle Pack *cough* being at least worth considering.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As is the case with most battle-packs there really isn&#39;t much to the set besides the minifigures (which are superb but more on that in a bit), usually a little ship or speeder is provided for the figures to use which is fine but&nbsp;75036:&nbsp;Utapau Troopers&nbsp;stands out as being even better than usual. At first I wasn&#39;t sure why this battle pack in particular caught my interest the clones are nice but not any more detailed than most of the other Star Wars figures released recently but then it struck me, by having four minifigures versus a large enemy this battle-pack has done something that no other has and has ended being one of the best battle-packs released so far.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty standard size and shape for a set at this price point CA $15.99 (&pound;11.99 / US$12.99 / &euro;14.99) and shows the clones fighting the Tri-Droid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Parts</span></p>

<p>Like most sets its size there are only a few interesting non-minifigure pieces in&nbsp;75036:&nbsp;Utapau Troopers, the most notable and obvious being the medium sized sand coloured dome, which could be quite useful when building your own thing though the colour isn&#39;t the greatest.&nbsp;The other notable pieces are those used to make the new stud-firing blaster that was introduced in this wave of Star Wars sets. These new blaster are actually pretty neat, even though they don&#39;t look nearly as stylish or accurate as the previous blasters (even the old megaphone blasters almost look better) they make up for in functionality and these blasters are actually rather powerful given their size as they are able to knock a minifigure over and back quite a bit.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The four minifigures included are two Clone Paratroopers and two 212 Clone Troopers. Even for licensed minifigures based on characters from a live-action film&nbsp;these minifigures are detailed with a truly incredible attention to detail&nbsp;with pouches and scuff marks to add to the battle hardened trooper look.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/tTJIfwJ.jpg?1"" style=""width: 350px; height: 457px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/fibFzPz.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The clone paratrooper&#39;s helmet is very nice and much rounder than that of the standard clone trooper, resembling an upside down bucket with a oversized lip. The helmet has a black long, thin visor going across the middle with two slanted orange lines coming out the upper side, a small black mark below to show the nose ridge and scuff marks above and below the visor. The helmet breather is vertical down the middle half with orange marks on each side of it at the bottom and two vents on the left and right sides of the bottom. The front torso is printed with the standard clone trooper armour overlaid with various details and orange highlights on the belt pouches. The upper left side of the troopers chestplate is just printed with two downward-slanted orange lines while the right side of the chestplate has a black, with orange highlight, shoulder/chest-pad of some sort with two light grey straps going down from it to the two main pouches on the belt at the bottom. A medium tan ammo strap also goes down from the top right to the bottom left. The trooper&#39;s left arm is plain white while the right arm is orange. The legs are white but have some very nice printing to show the armour ridges and kneeplate with the left kneeplate being orange with two slanted orange lines above it.</p>

<p><br />
<img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/DTayGJQ.jpg?2"" style=""width: 350px; height: 423px;"" /></p>

<p>The back of the helmet is plain white but is mould with two vertical ridges going down the center and starting from the middle. The back torso also has the standard clone printing but with a continuation of the tan ammo strap and a light grey strap going up to the little bit of shoulder pad on the trooper&#39;s right. The back of the legs have no printing but are covered by a clone armour skirt seen previously in another battle-pack (9488) but this time coloured in medium stone-grey.</p>

<p>The 212 Clone Trooper&nbsp;is essentially just a standard clone trooper with added orange markings and scuff marks. The clone is the same as the version included in the Clone Turbo Tank microfighter but the print is a bit different in some places. The helmet is the same as all post-2013 phase 2,&nbsp;except with an orange&nbsp;chevron at the top and some scuff marks, looking very much like the end of a tube and sitting high on the minifigure&#39;s head. The face of the helmet is printed with the classic clone T-visor and a detailed mouth grille in the center with shading on the sides. The front torso is again&nbsp;printed with the standard clone trooper armour overlaid with an orange chevron a the top center and mid-sides and more highlights on the belt, both the arms are orange. The legs are both white with a chevron across the top of both and like the clone paratrooper&#39;s they have print showimg the ridges in the armour along with kneepads which have a bit of orange on the inner edge.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The build</span></p>

<p>The build is pretty simple and mainly consists of minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a set at the lowest price point available in the Star Wars theme (CA $15.99/&nbsp;&pound;11.99 / US $12.99)&nbsp;75036:&nbsp;Utapau Troopers&nbsp;has a high playability factor especially when compared to sets like&nbsp;75034:&nbsp;Death Star Troopers. Even though the flick-fires are in an awkward position the addition of an enemy Tri-Droid instead of a vehicle or something for the clones means that one could play with this without need for any additional sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Most battle-packs are made to be paired with other sets or battle-packs for opposings sides but as mentioned before this battle-pack is especially good because it includes mutiple minifigures from the same army but also provided an enemy for them to fight. But another thing that&nbsp;75036:&nbsp;Utapau Troopers&nbsp;made me think of is how sorely the Star wars theme is missing sets like this, that is small sets where mutiple figures face off against a larger enemy or, like in the case of a sets such as&nbsp;75037:&nbsp;Battle on Saleucami,&nbsp;versus a vehicle. Of course battle-packs are great but it&#39;s nice to be able to buy one small set and have a non minifigure vs. minifigure fight, instead of a set for each opposing army as was the case for most battle-pack releases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that this set is a great example of the variety that has been missing from the battle-packs but that also seems to recently be absent from the Star Wars theme as a whole. This set reminds me of when I was a child and I only had a small amount of my own money (something I&#39;m sure many others remember), aside from Christmas&#39; and Birthdays the only sets I was able to buy were about five or ten dollars. Since I was just a kid my judgement was much less discerning and besides that I didn&#39;t have access to consumer reviews of sets, so most sets I bought were only ok and some were duds, but every once in a while I&#39;d stumble upon a great set that I&#39;d play with for hours and come to throughly enjoy.&nbsp;75036: Utapau Troopers&nbsp;is one of those standout sets.</p>

"anofficialstripeline","2014-07-22T06:55:07.64Z","This is the real deal!","<p>Here&#39;s my review for 75036.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The total pages of building is 16. Does show some play features, which we can see it from the back and some ads that Lego is promoting.One problem is that it does NOT show a list of sets that we can see after the build is done!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>We get mostly new blasters which kids will enjoy a lot, but when you get older, that&#39;s when you realize its not fun any longer. Mostly the new parts are the clones because we never get to see them in any other sets, but for the rest, we&#39;ve seen them in the 1900&#39;s and the previous years of Lego sets that had the parts not new. Really good stuff.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>?212th Clone Trooper-We did get one last year which was based off the clone wars series, but the figure was stupid because the character looks more like 327th&nbsp;Star Corp Trooper. But for this, looks must accurate and Lego finally got these guys right. Damaged marks on clone trooper helmets and torso really stand the set up itself, really looks right to the movie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>212th Paratrooper-Compared to the Scouts from Kashyyyk, these are so much new and something that I would I pick up from stores. The kama&nbsp;is really good, shows more representation and has really good markings on the whole figure, itself. Gets in the way when theres one orange and white arm, but really doesn&#39;t matter any&nbsp;ways. Like I said about the Clone Trooper, still good, and looks accurate to the movie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Like I said from the instruction manual, it&#39;s 16 pages of building, and I had a fun time of building. Moreover, there&#39;s nothing else I can say for this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>After building, these set doesn&#39;t look too bad, even when its small. Just by watching before the Order 66 part of Star Wars Revenge Of The Sith, there will be a scene where you can briefly see the tri-droid, which is in Utapau. Really good. Has some good play features, no stickers, good, and good&nbsp;rotation of 360 degrees. The play features is actually not bad, flick fire, blasters, and spinning which is also good. The set is flawed by some parts that try to make the set good, and don&#39;t care if its not accurate&nbsp;nor&nbsp;matters when the color scheme, it still doing at its best.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is one&nbsp;my favorite battle packs overall for this years wave. Even though others would say either Death Star or Kashyyyk, this is still much better compared to the any other set. Besides saying 212th is my favorite, or saying camouflage is what I dislike, the reason why I like it is because there is a good representation with clones that were in the movie Revenge Of The Sith. Moreover with that, its&nbsp;like clones vs droids set, which I do love a lot! Mainly because&nbsp;</p>

"jackybrick","2014-05-19T20:47:32.29Z","Shoot that Tri-droid, men!!! (- because now you really can)","<p>I was really excited, when LEGO started producing these new, really-shooting minifig blasters, so far- mainly for the Star Wars sets. I was also a bit indecisive, whether to pick this battle pack (75036) or the Death Star Troopers (75034), because both of them include interesting minifigures. Finally, I decided to get this one first, chiefly because it has more of the new blasters (4) than the other one (2).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The set comes in a small (although larger than the 2013 battle packs tiny ones), rectangular-shaped box. On the front boxart you can see a simple battle scene, where the Utapau&nbsp;Troopers are firing at the Tri-droid. Except the usual set info (age, set number, set name,...) there&#39;s also a notice about the new blasters included. The back side of the box shows some more battle scenes, as well as the set features.</p>

<p>So, in the box are hiding two unnumbered bags of parts and a little instruction booklet. The instructions are accurate and will guide you quickly and easily through the build. At the end of the instructions, the features of the set are shown again and except that, (and the parts inventory of course), there&#39;s only one advert- for the LEGO SW website, so not any 2014 SW wave 1 adverts or a minifig-list, as you would maybe expect.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Parts</span></p>

<p>New weapons, as well as the new, exclusive helmet moulds for the Airborne Clone Troopers are included. You also get two of the rare skirts/lower capes, which are carefully packaged in the little, white, cardboard wrapping, inside one of the bags. The dome mould, used &nbsp;as the top of the Tri-droid, is also new colour. You get some extra pieces as always, e.g. the trans-blue studs, or a trigger used in the blasters,...</p>

<p>No stickers are used for this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One of the main factors of this little set- you get two of each- Airborne and 212th&nbsp;Battalion Troopers. Personally, I like the Airborne guys more. All of the Troopers have a one-side-printed faces with the same, rather angry expression, nice double-sided torso printing and the legs printing as well. And there&#39;s yet one another thing worth the notice, and that is, that the Airborne Troopers torso-pieces have a different colour&nbsp;for each of their arm (left one=white, right one=orange)- that&#39;s pretty cool, I think.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is mostly simple,nothing challenging, maybe except for the part, where you have to put the skirts on your minifig&#39;s legs properly. In the case of the Tri-droid, the more interesting part is building it&#39;s base, &#39;cause&#39; the legs are rather repetitive.</p>

<p>It&#39;ll take you only 10-15 minutes and everything will be complete.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The fact, that you get something new (in the case of battle packs), and not just another speeder or a small cannon, makes you feeling satisfied about this set and the blaster shooting mechanism works really well, and it really is boosting the play experience to a high-level.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I can only recommend this battle pack to anyone, who likes to play with their sets even sometimes, not only has them displayed somewhere. Even if, you are not a huge SW fan, but you like the space themed sets, get it for the new blasters, some nice figs and an interesting droid-battle-machine. And of course, this set works well as an army builder, because you won&#39;t get tired of these cool&nbsp;minifigs so easliy. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"PooPotato","2014-04-03T22:54:34.53Z","Airborne to the Rescue!","<p>*I would like to note that legomuffin413 is absolutely correct about the Tri-Droid appearing in miniature form in the Battle of Utapau. &nbsp;Everything I say about this droid not appearing in the films is incorrect, but I still stand by my opinion that a crab-droid would have worked much better.*</p>

<p>The Battle of Utapau was one of the most exciting scenes in Star Wars Episode III, even if it only lasted for 10 minutes. &nbsp;Star Wars Battlefront II expanded on the battle, creating a wonderful battleground with movie accurate details, and furthered my interest in the troops of the 212th Attack Battalion led by Commander Cody.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box was the same style as the other 2 battlepacks released in this line, as were the instructions.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>The parts included with the main model in this battlepack could be incredibly useful for a MOC, especially the dark tan dome on top of the Octuptarra magna tri-droid. &nbsp;The amount of pieces included is quite disappointing however, standing at a weak 86. &nbsp;This in no way justifies the $13 price tag, especially when 75000 Clone Troopers vs. Droidekas has 124.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigs are the star of the set, so naturally I will discuss more about them.</p>

<p>Included are two standard&nbsp;212th Attack Batallion&nbsp;troopers, who look very accurate when compared to their film counterparts. &nbsp;The new helmet design and the orange highlights make this trooper look way better than the previous design in 75013. &nbsp;A platoon of these guys disembarking a Republic Gunship would look great in any MOC as well. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The two more exciting minifigures&nbsp;to me were the 2nd Airborne Clone Troopers. &nbsp;A little known fact is that these guys are not part of the 212th Attack Battalion, but coexist with them under the 7th&nbsp;Sky Corps. &nbsp;The troopers come with the new cloth &#39;kamas&#39;, and have the same ugly new blasters that come with the other battlepacks. The torso/leg printing is outstanding, and the new helmet design is too good to stay exclusive to this set. &nbsp;Hopefully Lego makes more Episode III sets in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build was extremely repetitive,and didn&#39;t have any particularly exciting moments. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>When compared to the source material, this model looks absolutely terrible. &nbsp;Considering that the tri-droid is a very large vehicle, the choice to include it as a battlepack&nbsp;model was a poor one. &nbsp;It should also be mentioned that a crab-droid would have worked wonderfully here, as you actually see them in the Battle of Utapau. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigures in this set, like in Kashyyyk Troopers look wonderful, and it is very nice that you get 4 of them. &nbsp;However, the main model looks horrendous, and would have a much better future as scrap parts. &nbsp;The minifigures are the only thing that are stopping this set from receiving a much lower mark.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>4 awesome minifigures</p>

<p>New helmet designs</p>

<p>&#39;Kama&#39; leg capes</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Terrible model</p>

<p>The designs of 2014 once again take their cues from Hasbro&rsquo;s packaging design, with Darth Vader in the top left corner and the dark blueish coloring with the strange cracks of red shown. This packaging is very similar to Hasbro&rsquo;s Saga Legends line, it isn&rsquo;t as collector oriented as the Black Series, however the shared design once again must be a Disney mandated thing. Since I doubt Hasbro or LEGO enjoy having their products in identical looking packaging. I wonder if the licensor makes the designs for the product packaging and passes it on to all of the licensees who are working with their franchise.</p>

<p>The instructions are the same as past Star Wars sets, with cross-promotional imagery being very minimal for this 18 page manual. Honestly this set&rsquo;s instructions do what they set out to do, show you how to build the contents. However I think they do suffer having less pages, for this set though I can see why they might be a bit minimalistic compared to larger more piece heavy sets.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Considering the limited number of pieces in this set, nothing really stands out. New blasters are introduced in 2014 and you can get some nice new leg pauldrons for the Airborne Troopers in this set, as far as the main model is concerned. Nothing much to say here.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>You receive four very impressive looking minifigures in this set, which is a big draw for the set if you&rsquo;re a fan of clones. In particular you will get two each of the Airborne Clone Trooper and the 212<sup>th</sup> Battalion Trooper.</p>

<p>212<sup>th</sup> Battalion Trooper: Both of these minifigures have the exact same print, they are based on the Phase 2 clones with the more rounded helmets, which are closer to the Stormtrooper design. Both of them come with the new stud launcher blaster, not the molded blasters that past sets have favored. This is a new play feature which is hit or miss honestly, as an AFOL the weapons are a bit unfortunate for when you want to display these Clones amongst the army of others you have with the sculpted blaster pieces.</p>

<p>As a kid however you might enjoy this accessory more, although you&rsquo;re bound to lose a tone of studs. Each set includes six extra studs for launching, and you&rsquo;ll no doubt have tons of the clear blue studs if you collect LEGO regularly, as they are often given out as spare pieces since they are easily lost or misplaced.</p>

<p>The print details on the 212<sup>th</sup> Troopers are pretty sweet, some of the most detailed clones I&rsquo;ve gotten. LEGO seems to be stepping up their game lately, with all the awesome detail work found in such Themes as Legends of Chima and The LEGO Movie, introducing more fine details and movie accuracy prints is a really big step up from the LEGO I had growing up.</p>

<p>Airborne Clone Troopers: These minifigs have even more great detail, with double-sided torso printing, leg printing, helmet printing and the standard Clone Heads found in most sets. This minifigure is interesting because he has one orange arm and one white arm. Again there are two stud launchers for accessories instead of the sculpted blasters we&rsquo;ve become accustomed to.</p>

<p>I suppose that means you can consider these weapons as heavy blasters or something. Or just bricklink spare regular blasters for your army of clones. Overall though this set is a prime example of why LEGO minifigures are the go-to collectibles in these sets.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>This is a very poor build, since the model is very small and not as fun as past battle packs. Honestly while you got vehicles in the past, here you get to build a Tri-Droid model which is very fast to build, not to tricky and lacks some substance. It&rsquo;s a solid build, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, however I feel that this is borderline a box full of five minifigures because of the fact you&rsquo;re building a character instead of a vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>I love the quirky nature of the Tri-Droid, the LEGO model captures this nicely with the awkward almost 50&rsquo;s era sci-fi looking attack droid element. What I don&rsquo;t like is that this model has three flick-fire missiles situated around the upper dome, this play feature makes the model look goofy and the missiles stick out, what would have helped it more would have been to incorporate the stud launching gimmick of the blasters, that way you wouldn&rsquo;t have three missiles sticking out where the guns would be located on the on-screen model.</p>

<p>Also I&rsquo;m not a fan of the colour scheme, when Hasbro made this particular droid they used a much darker, black colour scheme for their figure. I think black would have made for a better looking droid, it would have been less awkward, especially if they chose a different colour for the upper dome and stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty weak offering from LEGO, considering the number of pieces in other battle packs I think they could have done better here, maybe throw in enough parts for two Tri-Droids at least, making the set more viable for army building since you&rsquo;d get two Tri-Droids with four Utapau clones each time. Mildly recommended as an army builder, however I strongly suggest you try to get it on sale.</p>

<p>Star Wars battle packs have a history of being incredibly popular and useful for building armies. This one is certainly no exception, and is one of the best examples of all time.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>The set comes in a small thumb punch box. The front shows the set in a basic action shot and the back shows off the new (at the time) guns, as well as some other features. Standard fare.</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>Obviously the main draw of this set is the minifig parts, but the new guns are pretty neat. The dark tan parts on the tridroid are useful as well.</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p>Now this is why you bought the set! Here we have the long awaited 212th clones, and the 212th airborne troopers. They all share the same boring new clone face, but they are all perfectly detailed. The prints contain the right mix of scuffs, dirt, and rank markings to make a set of very realistic minifigs. The airborne helmet sculpt in particular is superb, as well as the soft cloth kamas at their waists.</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>Quick and easy build for this one. Similar to building a small clone walker, followed by a cylinder portion. It took me probably around 7 or 8 minutes.</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>The tridroid is nothing to write home about. It is a decent looking thing, not bad by any means, but it could use some eyes or other details. It feels like a parody of a larger model we have yet to see. However, in the official story there are various sizes of this droid unit, so it scales well with the clones and other Separatist vehicles.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>The clones are what you&#39;ll really buy this set for and they are perfect representations of the 212th troopers from Revenge of the Sith. The tridroid is a fun little model too and is a nice bonus. This is a good model for other battle packs: 4 troops from one side and a vehicle/droid/base from the other is a good balance and prevents the necessity of a second battle pack. Recommended for Star Wars and minifig fans.</p>

"SanMams91","2015-02-26T05:01:23.03Z","Excellent Orange Clones","<p>Battle packs are solely made for people to acquire the minifigures&nbsp;featured in these small sets. Are these figures magnificent? Absolutely.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Usual box, nice art.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not many parts to use here.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Clearly the main draw of the set, I bought it mainly to get the Airbourne&nbsp;Troopers, but found that I actually enjoyed the look of the 212th battalion troopers just a bit more! They are excellent designs, a must have for clone collectors or army builders, or for people who simply like see figures, like I did.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build was brief, but nothing special. The droid&#39;s missiles are a little difficult to flick, but you can always on them hard with your finger.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not a bad set of figures. Seriously, get this only if you want the figures. Well done Lego!</p>

<p>Parts &nbsp; Dark tan for Ep. 1 MTT and AAT. Other than that, nothing useful.</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp; &nbsp; The reason most of us will buy this set. The 212th&nbsp;Battalion Marches On!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;212th Battalion Clone Trooper 2x: Exceeded my expectations, These are truly tough troopers and have battle damage on the helmets, although still looking like pristine white knights somehow.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;212th Battalion Paratrooper/ Airborne Trooper 2x: I would have preferred &nbsp;2 more regular troops or even Cody himself, but these are impressive as well. They are supposedly Paratroopers, but I think they look more like Commandos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build &nbsp; The Octpurra Tri-Droid&nbsp;is&nbsp;small in comparison to their on screen counterparts, but to large would be unreasonable I think&nbsp;. I would have preferred stud shooters to the horrible, the horrendous, the old-fashioned flick missile. Other than flick-missiles, I don&#39;t have any problems with it.</p>

<p>The completed model &nbsp;This thing is beast. It has great troopers and a pretty good droid.</p>

<p>Overall opinion &nbsp; I love this thing and I recommend anyone who can find it to buy it or even duplicates.</p>
