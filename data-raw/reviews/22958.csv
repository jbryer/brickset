<p>... Day 1 on Saleucami: &quot;Can&#39;t find my fellow troopers. I am cruising through the desert with my newly constructed BARC-Speeder. Some one made a mistake, I guess, and deployed me on the wrong side of the battlefield.&quot;</p>

<p>... Day 16 on Saleucami: &quot;Today I found tracks of two clankers amidst the wilderness. I am growing quite fond of these greenish plants, I&#39;ve found. The wriggly ones are edible, the brownish leaves are stingy and too hard to chew, but make for a good hideout.&quot;</p>

<p>... Day 19 on Saleucami: &quot;Now it&#39;s clear, that I am not alone: I saw a Clanker on a&nbsp; STAP at the horizon. It had problems holding onto the device and hung from it, like it had no base for it&#39;s feet. Strange.&quot;</p>

<p>... Day 22 on Saleucami: &quot;Still no sign of my fellow troopers. Tried to raise their attention by firing my gun, but it didn&#39;t work: Can&#39;t shoot any bricks with it. Who would issue such an outdated gun?!&quot;</p>

<p>... Day 23 on Saleucami: &quot;I feel so alone.&quot;</p>

<p>... Day 27 on Saleucami: &quot;Today I&#39;ve found the clanker&#39;s hideout. It&#39;s four of them! And two are fearsome battledroids.That&#39;s almost a small army. I&#39;ve got only so much energy left in my BARC-laser, to get four straight shots at them. I&#39;ll try my very best then.&quot;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I somehow do not like the dark blue box with Darth Vader on it, his pose just looks stupid and not Dart Vader like. But I will not&nbsp;integrate that fact into my ratings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I like the Saleucami flora with the green and beige parts, but concerning parts there aren&#39;t &quot;must-haves&quot;.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Of course you only buy those Battle-Pack sets because of the minifigures. Here we get five: Two Droids, two Battle droids and J U S T one Clone-Trooper. WTF! Regularly you get 2 vs 2. LEGO - to my mind - just thinks: &quot;mmh the BARC-Trooper is exclusive to this set. Enough. They&#39;ll buy it anyway.&quot; This is the reason why one really can&#39;t give more than 4 of 5.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>To me its useful that we don&#39;t get &quot;one big thing&quot; but three &quot;smaller things&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- the Saleucami&nbsp;flora: Good build, fu&quot;&quot;ing sticker, rare colors.&nbsp;<br />
- the Speeder bike: another speeder bike. Well, don&#39;t you think we have enough of them?<br />
- the Droid speeder: don&#39;t like the Blue Color because in that case it implies Clone Wars. I do very like the series, but such battle packs should be held not clearly Clone Wars - we want to use them for the Original Series and Clone Wars both. I don&#39;t use the sort of &quot;flick missile&quot;-types, but it increases the playability for younger kids.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not a model, it really is a set. Everything looks accurate and okay. I like the BARC-Trooper, good to have 4 additional droids and the Saleucami&nbsp;flora. But do we really need more Speeder-bikes and Droid-speeders? NO! We don&#39;t! In stead of those two I would have liked an additional Clone-Trooper and an additional droid. But it&#39;s just a blame that we don&#39;t get two clones.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>To be honest I am not &quot;playing&quot; with Lego that much anymore, I am just admiring the details and authencity. This set gives us a speeder-bike and a droid-speeder, which is okay, but just okay; the Saleucami-flora which is nice to have; the problem with this set are the minifigs. I cant say this enough: J U S T one Clone Trooper, okay it&#39;s a BARC-Trooper who is at least by now exclusive to this set, but the strategy behind this is just a NO GO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the reason why I give 4 out of 5!&nbsp;</p>

"brickman3","2015-01-04T15:22:04.577Z","Target in sight. Fire when ready!","<p>Of all sets, this is the coolest mini-set of Star Wars LEGO 2014, especially since it uses a Spring-Loaded shooter. I am going to give a quick overview of the Minifigures, and then we will do the pros and cons of the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Saleucami Clone Trooper:</strong></p>

<p>This is a pretty sweet clone for the set. He seems to have a design that blends with his speeder, plus I think that he could be camouflaged into the woods. Overall, he is pretty sweet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Battle Droids:</strong></p>

<p>The two battle droids are very classic, which I don&#39;t like. They have been using the EXACT SAME droid since 1999! Anyway, this set comes with two, as shown in the picture. However, one doesn&#39;t come with a weapon, meaning that he drives the STAP speeder. &nbsp;Also, the one with a blaster has a small platform&nbsp;which makes him stand right on the hideout to be shot at. I will talk about this more later in the review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Super Battle Droids:</strong></p>

<p>Again, two come with this set. As you should know, their arm has a blaster already set into it. Both of them have a foot platform, which they use to stand on the hidden platform.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before I do the pros and cons, let me explain the droid platform. The reason for the Spring-loaded Shooter is to take them out! What you do is you shoot at the droids with the Shooter, and attempt to make them fall! How cool is that? It&#39;s like a game!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now for the pros and cons:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>awesome design</li>
	<li>game with the droids</li>
	<li>Spring-loaded Shooter</li>
	<li>STAP speeder</li>
	<li>clones and droids</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>small</li>
	<li>droids don&#39;t stay up</li>
	<li>no new droids</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, this set does have some flaws, but it is pretty cool I think.</p>

"Tar_Domo","2014-08-31T18:53:45.163Z","Let the Battle Begin","<p>This is my favourite of the 2014 winter sets. I knew immediately I wanted this. It is great value for money: you get 5 minifigures, 2 speeders and an interesting scenery. (Scenery is not something you got in every LEGO set).</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>It&acute;s in a quite small, standard box. Instructions were easy to follow. Nothing special to say here.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>The scenery contains some interesting and exclusive parts. The speeders does not have anything very interesting parts but there is the spring-loaded shooter in the BARC speeder.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>For droid army builders this is the set you are looking for. Yes, it isn&acute;t as amazing as the 2007 MTT but it&acute;s a nice and quite cheap way to get some droids. It comes with two super battle droids and one standard battle droid. Those three have own standing platforms that is nice (The droids easily fall without than kind of things and it can be very annoying to put them stand once and once again). In the set there is also a battle droid with straight arms for the STAP. The only exclusive minifigure is Commander Neyo. He has a cool helmet and red color on his arms,</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>This was an easy one to build. My favorite part was building the scenery because it was kind of a new thing.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>This is a set for play more than for display. You can play a battle though commander Neyo is all alone against the droids (If you have other Clone Troopers, they would be needed). BARC speeder has a sticker with battle droid head, I think Neyo has counted there droids that he has destroyed. STAP is standard but cool.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>This is the best value-for-money set in years. I recommend it for droid army builders and those, who like to play with LEGOs.</p>

"JW_2187","2018-11-02T18:53:43.47Z","Battle of Saleucami","<p>The battle of Saleucami is a superb addition to the range of Clone Wars sets. It includes a large variety of parts- a BARC speeder, a STAP, a small separatist turret and 5 minifigs. Overall, The set is a success as to what can be achieved in terms of playability, especially in such a small set.</p>

<p>The speeder sacrifices aesthetics in the front section in place of playability, which I feel to be appropriate in a set such as this as it&#39;s aimed as a playset. It comfortably seats a minifigure in a realistic enough looking way and has a pair of light lasers on top of the engine blocks which use a small clever SNOT technique using a small technic beam to hold these assemblies off of the side at 90&#39;. The missile system on the front uses the small spring loaded shooter which has 3 spare missiles. However the boxy design of this piece and non-white colouration leading it to have a far more obvious look in comparison to the Imperial shuttle Tydarium from 2015.</p>

<p>The STAP is a standard design using a SNOT structure, with curves on the front, loudhailers for engines, T-bars with trapezoid flags and small build with a ridged curve with 2 light lasers on top. This design works however does become monotonous over time as it is used in multiple sets. The base however is a lot lower than other versions so that it can be hit by the missiles of the BARC&nbsp; speeder, hence is an improvement for this type of set.</p>

<p>The turret system is divided into 3 parts which are split with plate hinges. They can each hold the 2x2 base which can still be knocked over by the missiles in the BARC speeder. The first has reeds which are a decently rare part wherein there are 3 reeds included in an olive green colour. The middle section has no plant parts. The section has a suggestion of a computer console which has a standard lego city wheelarch piece, which is a clever use of the piece. This also has a sticker on the front, which has a sticker showing the bullet holes on the front curve. The final is a different shape and has a dark tan palm leave with olive detailing. This is more boring and has a thin unfinished look however it does the job and doesn&#39;t look particularly weak overall.</p>

<p>The figures are a mixed bag, and include 2 battle droids (1 adapted for the STAP), 2 Super Battle Droids and the highlight, Captain Neyo. The battle droids and super battle droids have very little in terms of rarity, especially the regular battle droids however they are sufficient as cannon fodder and can be knocked over. Captain Neyo has rare exclusive printing and is one of the best clone figures. The figure itself is the best part of the set, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Overall, the set has a clever play feature and cost only &pound;14.99 in the UK so is a 5/5 from me. They are still quite common so can still be found on the second hand market and not for at an exponential price.</p>

"SlimBrick1","2021-11-09T23:11:59.7Z","Great playable and collectors set.","<p>I think the set is fairly good, the part per price ratio was good. The build experience was rushed, even if this was my first star wars set it felt like it went by really quick and there wasn&#39;t really any volume to it. Aside from that, I like the minifigure selection, the Neyo minifigure has great printing and it is pretty cool that he is exclusive. I like the super battle droids, considering LEGO has kinda forgotten they existed. The B.A.R.C speeder is a nice size compared to the newer ones.&nbsp;Overall, I think it is a great set,&nbsp;Even though there are some cons.</p>
