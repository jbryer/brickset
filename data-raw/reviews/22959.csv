<p>My first review of both the new MicroFighters&nbsp;line and a real set. You may or may not remember the Clone Turbo Tank as one of the many vehicles that appeared in Episode Three for two seconds and then promptly disappeared forever.</p>

<p>In the movie it was displayed as a massive vehicle of war, and in other Lego sets {not sure if it&#39;s canon} as a troop carrier. In the MicroFighters line it&#39;s portrayed as a small single seat vehicle, intriguing&nbsp;change. Time&nbsp;to examine this set and see if it&#39;s worth owning, hopefully entertainingly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The Clone Turbo Tank comes in the second smallest box in the Lego&nbsp;production line. It&#39;s not the sturdiest box that I&#39;ve ever encountered, getting flattened in my tote bag, I will however admit that it went for a couple mile walk in LA, so the box will be fine if you drive or take a short walk.</p>

<p>On the front of the box we have all the regular stats such as age, piece count etc. I do think six is a little young for this set, maybe a more appropriate&nbsp;age would be eight.</p>

<p>On the front of the box in the middle the mini Clone Turbo Tank is displayed prominently,&nbsp;blaster bolts whizzing by&nbsp;in the background.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m really liking&nbsp;the new explosion&nbsp;effects that are on the box, they look very vibrant and realistic. In the background we can see some mountains and mist. I would prefer to see the giant trees that are this planet&#39;s hallmark instead of the mountains.</p>

<p>One thing I forgot to mention is the sand that is getting stirred up by the tires. It looks incredibly good, looking almost like it&#39;s in 3D.</p>

<p>There is a small thing on the top of the box that I think is worth mentioning. On the top theres a picture of the clone trooper minifigure&nbsp;exclaiming new and actual size.</p>

<p>On the back of the box we have another picture of the vehicle showing the flick fire missiles. Theres also a bunch of ads for the other sets in the MicroFighters line and a new app.</p>

<p>In conclusion the box does everything it needs to, making you want to by the set. Theres not much to say about the instructions, I saw no mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In this set we get one minifigure, a basic phase two clone trooper. For being a basic clone trooper it&#39;s surprising that he only appears in this set.</p>

<p>The helmets nor a new mold, but the printing looks much better the its predecessors. We have the instantly recognizable t shaped visor&nbsp;which looks extraordinary.</p>

<p>You may notice small indents in the cheek area, which lend extra depth to the helmet. Theres also a line running across&nbsp;the top of his head that looks cool.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to complain about it that much in this review, I will save that for a older set review, but I hate fleshy heads. They just seem so weird and unlegoish, however I won&#39;t let my personal opinion cloud my judgment since it&#39;s a very nice face.</p>

<p>He&#39;s definitely not the most happy clone trooper, but who can blame him, they said he would drive a Clone Turbo Tank and they gave him a MicroFighter.</p>

<p>He seems to be snarling his face showing anger and physical effort. He has big bushy black eyebrows and stress lines around his face, he has one on his chin that looks like a goatee.</p>

<p>The torso is divine and the best part of the minifigure. He has the standard breast plate armor. Something to note is that on his left breast he has to sideways lines, whether this is a indication of rank or just fluff, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>He has a tool belt which we can assume has all kind of&nbsp;equipment&nbsp;in it, looks really nice. On the back of the torso there is a rectangle on his back, not sure what it&#39;s for, but it looks cool, the belt also continues on the back.</p>

<p>The legs &nbsp;unlike those of other years of printing on them. It&#39;s a simple pattern, but it lends a whole level of new depth to the clone trooper.</p>

"JVM","2014-05-29T06:36:52.05Z","Great Set for Kids and Minifig Fans","<p>The <em>LEGO Star Wars: Microfighters&nbsp;- Clone Turbo Tank</em> is a fun set and one of the new introductory Microfighters line, which throws accuracy to the side to increase playability, with new chibi-style vehicles with flick missiles and a minifig each, many of them army builders. While I enjoyed the Planet series, I feel like this is a much better solution for attracting kids, and one that&#39;ll work better for collectors in the long-run, as there&#39;s a very limited number of planets. It also allows easier army-building so far.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is fairly square and depicts the set - not much else to report. &nbsp;The tiny, folded instructions were a little hard to use at first but I was able to get used to them personally. I don&#39;t have any specific complaints or compliments.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too out of the ordinary here - all largely basic parts, including everyone&#39;s favorite flick-fire missiles and a ton of round pieces for wheels. I&#39;m not a good judge of parts to be honest.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There&#39;s one minifig here, a new episode 3 Clone Trooper in classic white - my expectations were low for this figure, since I thought it would be too detailed and realistic to fit into the LEGO collection but holding it, it&#39;s actually great, and the detail manages to stay LEGO-y. While I look forward to collecting the 212th Legion and Kashyyyk Troopers, I kind of wish the Classic White showed up in more sets. I want a dozen of &#39;em. In fact, perhaps it might&#39;ve been better to do a battle pack of White Troopers and to put a Kashyyyk Trooper in here - but I&#39;m not TLC.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not much to report, honestly. It&#39;s a very simple build and for any experience collector, especially those who create MOC&#39;s, it&#39;s probably going to be mind-numbingly boring. For the kids though, I think the technique of using the round pieces for wheels might be a fun diversion from the usual dedicated wheel pieces - but for any AFOL, they could probably build a dozen of these in their sleep.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a cute little tank - it&#39;s far from accurate, but it has a strange charm to it. It rolls surprisingly good on the wheels. While I&#39;m not a big fan of flick-fires, I won&#39;t dock points for it. The level of detail for a model of this size, without using stickers, was impressive to me - it wasn&#39;t too busy, but it had a little more to it than just a box on wheels, which is what I would&#39;ve expected. It has little collectors&#39; value but if I were a kid crazy on clones, I think I&#39;d love this set. Note that if you want your Clone to sit in the tank he has to have his gun sticking out.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A strong entry into the new&nbsp;Microfighters line that shows a promising concept rendered effectively, and offers a great new minifig for troop-building. There&#39;s a good level of playability but a lot of film accuracy is sacrificed. I&#39;d highly recommend this set to kids and minifig collectors, but for the average AFOL, there&#39;s not really much reason to buy this set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:20:23.6Z","Series 1 Microfighters Hit or Miss, but Always Impress","<p><strong>Set #75028 Clone Turbo Tank:</strong> Star Wars Microfighters are an interesting new idea that has taken off quite nicely. However it&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve been late to the party to, the sets are an interesting one and for these reviews we&rsquo;ll be going over everything we can, but in a different way than is traditional. With that being said, let us begin in numerical order with the first Microfighter in Series 1.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Clone Trooper: According to Brickset this Clone Trooper is unique to this set. He&rsquo;s got your standard Clone Trooper Printing with a double-sided torso, leg printing and single-sided facial printing we&rsquo;ve come to expect for these guys. He&rsquo;s also carrying a standard LEGO blaster piece. I believe however that his helmet features some really nice brand new print detailing, it is a standard piece though representing the phase 2 helmet.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s overall a sweet looking Minifigure and excellent for army building even more clones, if you wanted to.</p>

<p><strong>The Microfighter &amp; Build</strong></p>

<p>This set is far too small to separate the discussion, so I&rsquo;ll just add the two together. As far as the build is concerned, I&rsquo;m actually quite impressed at what LEGO did for the design. It pulls off a chibi look of the PT era vehicle quite well and the clever use of cylinder pieces for wheels is a really nice touch.</p>

<p>The Microfighter itself is something I could see in a LEGO Star Wars video game. Something that a Minifigure could ride and use as a Wacky Racers race car or some kind of bumper vehicle. The Microfighters really remind me of the Wacky Racers, and considering the designs and vehicles chosen for the first two series I&rsquo;m kind of hoping we see a Death Star for Series 3.</p>

<p>Naturally you have flick-fire missiles for a play feature. I don&rsquo;t mind this, it&rsquo;s quite impressively incorporated into the design of the vehicle and works brilliantly. Overall I&rsquo;m a huge fan of these little vehicles and look forward to picking up the rest of them.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t start out as a fan of the Microfighters designs. I wasn&rsquo;t impressed with the squat proportions, but slowly acquiring them I began to realize just how fun they were. They aren&rsquo;t meant to be accurate representations, they&rsquo;re meant to be fun toys that represent iconic vehicles from the Star Wars mythos. And in that way they deliver spectacularly. I would strongly recommend some of the others over this set, however this is still a great set, and I recommend it for army building fans and fans of Clones in general.</p>

"PooPotato","2015-01-09T01:03:50.4Z","My First Microfighter, Hopefully Not the Last","<p>When the Planet sets got discontinued I was relatively disappointed. &nbsp;Although the planet itself was quite useless, we got an accurate representation of a Star Wars vehicle and hopefully an exclusive minifigure along with it, such as Lobot. &nbsp;When I first saw what was to replace these sets, I wasn&#39;t very thrilled. &nbsp;I thought that the Microfighters would be more of a flop than the planet sets, and boy was I wrong.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was smaller than most, but looked quite attractive on the shelf in Meijer. &nbsp;The instructions were folded, but with a nice flat crease so it was easy to flatten out.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The main complaint I have about the Microfighter line&nbsp;is how much they cost. &nbsp;For only one minifigure and a small vehicle they cost $10 each. &nbsp;On the other hand, the $13 dollar battlepacks that recently came out give you a vehicle AND four minifigures, so it is a good thing that the minifigure included with this particular set is exclusive.&nbsp;Some of the parts were unique to me, such as the angular plates and the 2x2 with knob. &nbsp;If you are a parts scavenger, this set is kind of expensive for that goal. &nbsp;You&#39;d be better off getting a set with more pieces for more bang for your buck.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This minifigure is probably the primary reason I purchased this set. &nbsp;For how common this version of the Phase II Clone Trooper was during Star Wars Episode III, it is surprising that they only included him with one set. &nbsp;The new leg printing looks wonderful, and I wish that they had used it for the Phase I Troopers included with the Episode II sets released in 2013. &nbsp;A large army of these guys would look great, but good luck with that, $10 per minifigure is a hard bargain.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was of course simple, but I enjoyed it for its simpleness. &nbsp;Of course as with any vehicle made by Lego it was repetitive, but this has never really bugged me at all.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed Turbo Tank actually looks much more accurate than you&#39;d think. &nbsp;If you plugged up the driver&#39;s seat, took the windshield slopes off of the top and replaced the flick fire missiles, it would look very accurate to the source vehicle. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Although I am disappointed that we aren&#39;t receiving more accurate mini-models like with the planet sets, I am happy with this Microfighter in particular. &nbsp;It is recognizable to it&#39;s source material, it retains play function, and it comes with an exclusive minifigure. &nbsp;I&#39;m not a minifigure hoarder, but exclusive minifigures are going to be the deal breaker for me on these. &nbsp;For $10 each it is much too expensive to receive a minifig that I own 40 of (Battle Droid), or I find pretty unremarkable (Imperial Crew Member). &nbsp;The new wave of Microfighters looks much more promising, with a Clone Pilot that was exclusive to the $120 75021&nbsp;Republic Gunship and the new AT-AT pilot that is otherwise exclusive to the 75054 AT-AT. &nbsp;I hope that Lego continues this pattern of giving us rare minifigures for a much more reasonable price than their full sized counterparts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Relatively accurate model</p>

<p>Exclusive Minifigure</p>

<p>Nicely folded instruction booklet</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Steep price for only 1 minifigure</p>

<p>I hope to be purchasing some of the new 2015 sets, so stay tuned for more reviews!</p>

"Tar_Domo","2014-09-14T12:18:40.253Z","Phase II Clone and the Turbo Tank","<p>At first I say a little bit about the whole MicroFighters series. It&acute;s like the Planets series but you have to pay as much and get less. Some of the MicroFighters are bigger than the vehicles in the planet sets but still in the planet set the planet was a big part of the set. So this is a nice idea but really a little bit overpriced in my opinion. The minifigures in the planet series were also more exclusive than most of the ones in the MicroFighters.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This comes in a small box, similar size as the other MicroFighters. In the box there are printed&nbsp;pictures of other&nbsp;MicroFighters in the theme &quot;collect them all&quot;. Well that may help you or make you buy too many of these.</p>

<p>The instructions are in a booklet that has not much of pages. The instructions are easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This has about a 100 parts, exactly 96. They are good but standard parts. This includes two flick-fire missiles that are built from two parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The only minifigure is a phase II clone trooper. It&acute;s quite basic minifigure but nice for army building. It fits into the tank and has a standard blaster with it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this was easy and fast. You start with the minifigure and then build the tank.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a mini version of the clone turbo tank. The flick-fire missiles don&acute;t work very well but that&acute;s not too bad for me.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a set for play or for a collection. Collect them all if you want to but it&acute;s not a must-have.</p>

"thebrickgeek","2015-09-06T18:58:27.577Z","Clone turbo tank","<p>When the microfighters were released to be a replacement to the (not very good) planet sets it was met with a lot of controversty. Are they good or a total waste of money well lets go find out in this review!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a very small size roughly the same size as a battle pack and shows a nice display of the features and a advertisement to a app you can get in the app store.The instructions is very easy to follow and has no mistakes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing good parts here although more than I expected for such a little vehicle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigure is mostly the reason why I got it.The minifigure is a phase 2 clone trooper: This guy is just awesome It&#39;s a shame that this guy is only in this set and this set alone.The printing is just great on this guy,He has the standard angry clone face. His helmet is amazing but uses the same helmet mold released in 2013.There is a slight problem the leg printing seems to cut off which is only a minor problem. Overall a great minifigure but a shame it&#39;s only in one set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quick and simple really easy to build and nobody will have a problem with it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Despite for being a small build it is very accurate to the source material.There is one seat for the clone trooper to sit in. It has tenwheels to move around which uses ten brick O 16 cross,ten connector peg and ten plate 2x2 plate to make.They move very good across every surface.They have&nbsp; two flick missiles which isn&#39;t the best shooting feature but it will do for this set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set isn&#39;t bad for a little model but at &pound;9.99/$9.99 it should have at least two minifigures.So the microfighter isn&#39;t so bad and are great little models to collect and are going to sell well.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>nicely accurate model</p>

<p>Great minifigure</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>another minifigure would have been good</p>

<p>That is it Thank you for reading this review And I hope you enjoyed. good bye</p>

"HandPositions","2020-05-11T18:48:26.527Z","Clone Turbo Tank Microfighter: Perfect For Playability","<p>LEGO set number 75028, the Clone Turbo Tank Microfighter, is a 96-piece set that originally cost US $9.99. At its small size, its playability is perfect for fans and collectors alike.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since this set is small, this review is not going to be too in-depth. The set includes only one minifigure, a Phase 2 Clone Trooper. He has sleek, white armour with coordinating printings on the torso and legs. He also has a blaster element as an accessory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The microfighter is a very simple build. Released in 2014, it does not have side-mounted stud shooters. Instead, it has two flick missiles with transparent blue cones. The model is one of the few Star Wars vehicles with visible wheels; it includes ten wheels connected to it by tan limited-friction axle/pegs. Above the wheels, there is a small 2x2 cockpit with room for the Clone Trooper minifigure. The cockpit has two brown transparent cheese wedge elements to simulate a window. Finally, there is a light stone gray antenna element at the back of the model, representing a turret.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the wave this set was released in, the counterpart to this model was the AAT Microfighter, although, unlike modern Microfighters, it did not display a transparent version of it on the back of the box. Overall, this is a great set from the first Microfighters wave.</p>
