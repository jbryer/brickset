Honestly, though, this set is pretty good.  Even though the structure is frankly a bit confusing, it is good as a finished product.  The chess board should be bigger, and there should also be a better place for the keys.  But, Lego did a good job with the chess figure, and the wings for the keys.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MasterBuilder","2009-01-06T18:34:14.577Z","Catch the Key!","Great architecture, design, and elements. The new broomsticks were a really great addition, and the wands made the characters come to life. The keys were pretty sweet because they would fit in the wall when you weren't using them, and the spiderweb is a good excuse for not simply adding a wall. This openness allows the set to ""breath"" and makes the design a lot more interesting. The only bad part about this set is that the chess thing is kind of sad as it only includes one piece, the noob queen. I think they should have just greated a Lego Harry Potter chess set that doubles as a set in this series that could attach to the Hogwarts castle. The only other thing really is that the keys all fitted in the door so it was kind of easy to get through. Lastly, I think the movie should have had the troll in it so they could make another room with a different colored one. Also, the logic room which would include a whole bunch of goblets which could expand you collection widely.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BaneShake","2009-05-26T13:19:30.39Z","Room of the Winged Keys Review","   This set was my first Harry Potter set, and I wasn't disappointed. Here are some pros and cons.
   The good: great architectural work with the beams and roofing
                  plenty of keys, just like in the movie and book
                  the rooms seem connected but different to keep it from looking like a hallway
   The bad: there should be a separate and bigger set for the chess scene",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"parchioso","2010-01-29T11:03:58.483Z","Even for people who are not Harry Potter fans","Despite not being a Harry Potter fan, I like this set a lot, the old gray parts and tan color mix very well, and there are interesting elements being put together - spider and web, flames, keys, wings. The architecture is good, nice design integrating the arch, roof, door and having the two plates hinged together nicely.

The minifigs are excellent, with wands and star pattern capes included, the white queen is also interesting, I think the chrome silver crown and white torso with white hands are kind of rare.

Of course we need to mention the main element in the set aside from Harry Potter, the winged keys - with 4 old gray and 2 chrome silver keys, the wings (Feathers with Clip) are very rare, with the white ones seems available only in this set. The winged keys elements are movable, since I don't know much about the story, I can only say that they look interesting.

But overall the whole thing looks nice and magical, you don't need to be a Harry Potter fan to appreciate it.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-05T15:24:34.897Z","Wizard's Chess sure Shrunk","<p>Set #4704 The Room of the Winged Keys: Rather long title that, but nowhere near as bad as the names of the Vikings sets. This medium sized set from the Harry Potter Year One collection is your standard set from that era.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The walls are built with long bricks instead of individual bricks, the roof piece is unique and the build up to it can be fun, but if you choose to leave it off for combining with other set purposes it still looks impressive. And the play feature of this set is interesting if a little on the sparse side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LEGO was doing their best with Harry Potter, but the design of these sets is a little telling in their flaws. Many of them are just a bunch of open spaced sections meant to be combined with Hogwarts Castle. And (If like me.) you couldn't afford Hogwarts Castle than they kind of looked a little sparse, and also lost some points for the thicker base plates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sets however were still fun to build and fun to modify with other castle pieces, they also came with a lot of new accessories and other interesting looking pieces. Mini-Figure wise this set includes Harry Potter (Naturally), Ronald Weasley and White Queen Chess Piece. (The White Queen doesn't use any sort of standard looking mini-figure head, but it still looks interesting for a Mini-Figure and is to my knowledge the only Mini-figure to include the small crown piece that came with it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accessory wise you had four grey keys, two gold chromed keys (complete with magic wings.), two magic brooms, Harry's wand, Ron's wand, the Queen's staff (the first time the standard lightsaber blade was available in solid white if I'm not mistaken.) and two black capes with star patterns worn by Harry and Ron. There was also a transparent green spider. (Why transparent green? To add to the fantasy elements of course.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say it was a good early attempt at Harry Potter. LEGO however should have been a little more focused on locations rather than events from the film. At least in my opinion, it wasn't until Year Three, Prisoner of Azkaban that we got out of the habit of making oddly aesthethic looking sets that were meant to be attached to the main Hogwarts building. Perhaps that's why the Harry Potter theme started to dwindle, because they had little inspiration, which is a real shame because Harry Potter has so much potential.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, if you're interested in Unique pieces these Harry Potter sets are definitely a good source for them and great with the colors too. So I'd have to reccommend them quite strongly for the MOCing crowd. For Harry Potter enthusiasts who have only been exposed to the much more lavish sets of 2010... this may unfortunately not be for them. For someone who wants to make the ultimate Hogwarts Castle however you're going to need all of these little attachment based sets to really make one massive sized Hogwarts.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-20T05:10:23.153Z","LEGO Harry Potter - The Room of the Winged Keys Review","This set is a really cool set which also has an exclusive minifig. There're no stickers in there and this building is very sturdy. This set was part of the first Harry Potter movie when Harry had to get the correct key with his broom. Behind the door is a little chess board with a chess queen. This queen is the exclusive minifig we get. The torso and the skirt are all white. The head is a basic white cylinder brick and she also got a white staff. She also has a small crown. The other minifigs we get are Harry Potter and Ron Weasley.<br><br>The set itself is really fun to build and to play with. I widh the chess board was a little bit bigger which means that there could have been more chess figures in this set. I'm also surprised that Hermione Granger isn't included in this model. The room with the keys is also very cool. We get some bricks where you can attach the keys and behind the room you can also see a silver key with the blue wings which Harry has to capture. I can't complain much about this set. It may doesn't have as many details as the newer LEGO Harry Potter sets do but it's still lot's of fun!<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"HarryPotterLegoCollector","2020-10-05T15:42:05.87Z","Love the Queen figure, shame there is no Hermione figure","<p>I love that this set has a chess queen included, I just wish the chess board had been made to look bigger (this could be one with 1x1 tiles in black and white and not 2x2 tiles)</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- It comes with a Ron figure as well as Harry</p>

<p>- Queen figure unique&nbsp;to this set&nbsp;</p>

<p>- The addition of a broomstick (Common in newer sets now)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- Where is the Hermione&nbsp;figure??</p>

<p>- There&#39;s no key that has a broken wing</p>

<p>- The chess board could be made to look bigger</p>

<p>- There could have been hanging keys from the open archways&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I think this is a good little set.&nbsp;</p>
