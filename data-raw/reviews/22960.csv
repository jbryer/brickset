<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Small box (14*12*4.5 cm)&nbsp;with small instruction manual (10*14cm) which has 15 pages and there are 28 steps.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not very special parts, some rounded to give it the AAT-look.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is one Pilot Droid (blue torso) included which obviously is not exclusive but a good minifigure to get as it is not just another regular droid.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building doesn&#39;t take a lot of time but I found it amusing to put it together.</p>

<p>As it is a symmetric model a lot of the building is just mirrored.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Really cool miniature model.<br />
It has two flick-fire missiles and a fully rotating gun on top.</p>

<p>I like that they used the round pieces on the bottom to give it that hovering feel and it makes it easy to move around on most surfaces.</p>

<p>The Droid fits right in the cockpit and it has a place to store his small blaster.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I thought this was going to be my least favorite microfighter but it turned out very different,<br />
It is an pretty accurate miniature version of the AAT and lots of fun to play with.<br />
The price/piece ratio is about 10 cents so for Star Wars I like it.</p>

"Tar_Domo","2014-08-30T20:52:33.26Z","The Best Microfighter Till Now","<p>This is one of the Microfighter series set. Other Microfighter sets are: Millenium Falcon, Clone Turbo Tank, X wing starfigter, Imperial Star Destroyer and&nbsp;TIE interceptor.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong> I have to say that&nbsp;the pictures in the microfighter boxes are nice. The instructions were easy and good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts </strong>Here is a few exclusive parts that you can use for example to build your own microfighters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures </strong>Here is just one minifigure as in the other microfighter sets. It is a pilot battle droid. I think it&acute;s a good addition to this set and nice for the droid army builders. A standard battle droid wouldn&acute;t be bad but a little basic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The build </strong>Building was fast and took just about&nbsp;10 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model </strong>The AAT looks nice and it&acute;s good that you can put the droid in the tank.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion </strong>This is the best microfighter till now. You can buy even a few of these if you want to build some kind of army. I would recommend this to a Lego Star Wars collector, mostly to the Episode 1 and droid army collectors. If you want to test what you think of microfighters I would recommend you to start with this.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:21:43.81Z","Weakest Series 1 Microfighter","<p><strong>Set #75029 AAT: </strong>Microfighters are an impressive looking set of micro-scaled chibified vehicles from the Star Wars universe. I decided to skip discussing the packaging in these reviews because there really isn&rsquo;t much to say. You basically have a box with a design that shows off the set, the features and a cross-promotion for the game and other sets in the series. And the instructions really are just standard LEGO instructions.</p>

<p>Anyway those are my reasons for losing the discussion on those elements. That being said let&rsquo;s discuss this set in its entirety and whether or not it&rsquo;s worth picking up.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Battle Droid Pilot: What&rsquo;s to say here, it&rsquo;s a battle droid. If you aren&rsquo;t sick of this Minifigure by now than more power to you. He has the small pistol accessory and the blue torso signifying battle droid pilots. Really this design hasn&rsquo;t changed much since 1999 and I&rsquo;m kind of wondering if LEGO could even make a better designed version that could fold up like the character did on the screen. I doubt they&rsquo;d even try since it&rsquo;s cheap to produce these in comparison to designing something new to offer.</p>

<p><strong>The Microfighter &amp; Build</strong></p>

<p>This vehicle is awesome looking. It&rsquo;s a squat, fat awkward looking tank. The build uses fairly standard pieces without any really rare ones in the set. The steps are also fairly straightforward, without any tricky steps.</p>

<p>The huge open space for the pilot is a bit unfortunate for this design though, considering the tank is one vehicle that could get away with hiding the pilots station behind the tank turret, the fact that they left this huge open space just makes for an odd design choice. The two side cannons are black telescopes on flick-fire missiles, so you can shoot cannons at other vehicles.</p>

<p>The turret is nice, it turns and the cannon on top is a nice design choice. It&rsquo;s really a nice microfighter, it is however up to tastes and I can see where some might not like it because it is too squat and less streamlined.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend this only to those who want a complete series collection. It isn&rsquo;t the best offering from this wave and the Minifigure is just far too generic, but I suppose it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d expect from a Separatist vehicle. Definitely something you can skip if you&rsquo;re not a fan.</p>

"DJ_Bricks2","2016-02-15T11:42:06.94Z","Great Set","<p>A good set produced by LEGO, one of the less ridiculous-looking Micro-Fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Great box design and clear, easy to follow instructions.</p>

<p>- No parts missing and useful spares.</p>

<p>- Good pilot droid Minifigure, different to the others due to its angled arm that holds the blaster pistol.</p>

<p>- Good fun to build and doesn&#39;t fall apart.</p>

<p>- A good build, with flick-fire missiles and a rotating main cannon this is a small but effective design by LEGO.</p>

<p>My overall opinion would be that the model is well structured but, like all Micro-Fighters still looks ridiculous but not as much as the others. 4.5/5 Stars</p>

"GeneralGrievous0908","2021-06-07T16:48:47.413Z","Another Average Microfighter","<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>In my opinion, Microfighters&nbsp;are always partly for the minifigs, and at the time, this was not very exciting at all.&nbsp;Although a blue pilot battle droid wasn&#39;t&nbsp;that exciting at the time, it&#39;s quite a commodity nowadays as this droid hasn&#39;t been seen in 7 years now.</p>

<p>Parts:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts of this set, like the rest of the set, are just above&nbsp;average. There are some nice tan pieces used for the shaping of the set which aren&#39;t very common but the rest of the parts are nothing special.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>The build of this set is a nice little build for what it is. Not the best Microfighter build out there but any Star Wars fan can look at it and recognize what it is supposed to represent.</p>

<p>Building Process:&nbsp;<br />
Like most LEGO sets, the building process was smooth and easy.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Solid build, good parts, good minifigure</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>None</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Statement: This is a great little set for what it is, and although there nothing particularly wrong with the set, it just doesn&#39;t blow me away.</p>
