"zipsforbananas","2014-02-01T19:27:39.117Z","Might take a few more parsecs to make the Kessel run...","<p>This is the last of the four Old Trilogy chibi sets that I got from the first wave of microfighters. The ships don't interest me that much, and this figure is technically new, but I've got dozens of various Han Solos already.<br>In my other three reviews (of the TIE Interceptor, X-Wing and Star Destroyer) I had a fair bit of repeated text on the chibi feel of the ships and the value. I'm not a fan, but if you do like the chibi style they pull it off really well and I imagine you'll love them. And value wise, though they are small, the price per part ratio is the right side of 10p per piece, which is rare for a Star Wars set.</p><p><b>The build</b> isn't stunning, and only really has a couple of mildly interesting features, the combination of studs-on-side pieces for the cockpit piece and escape pod on the side (nothing novel, the other way round with a brick between them is more clever, but it might give youngsters ideas), and some 1x1 slopes put on at 45 degrees to follow the curvature of the hull (nothing spectacular, hence ""mildly!"").<br>In fact, I'm quite puzzled at the boat studs on the bottom. The design seems flawed, as they leave the ship front-heavy, so that when you push it to slide it forward it just tips up. Moving the front, cockpit-side one forward, perhaps using one of the spare pieces for where it overhangs, sorts out the issue. It seems careless of the designer to leave you to figure that out though. The studs hardly need to be symmetrical when the ship isn't.</p><p>As with the other microfighters <b>the parts</b> are interesting for what the set is. I hadn't realised the 6x6 round plates were new until I read Huw and CapnRex101's Simpsons house review, and you get two of them in light grey. There are also quite a few dark silver 1x1 round tiles, four 2x2 SNOT pieces with 2 studs on the side (two upwards, two downwards), and two 1x2 plates with a Technic bracket on. I liked the trans light blue 1x1 round bricks and 1x1 plates too.<br>Of course, the new droid head shaped printed cockpit piece is nice, though I can't think it's got many uses beyond a mini Falcon! (But then I'm not much of an MOCer.)</p><p>And <b>the figure</b> is, like the rest of the set, good, but unremarkable. The torso is the same as the recent A-Wing and Ewok Village version. The legs look new to me, but only on very, very close inspection - they're similar enough to the old versions. And the face print is new, for Han at least,and has a few lines adding a little age to him. (Nice, but odd on this earliest incarnation of Han, when the recent RotJ version, 4 years older and post-carbonite, now looks younger!)<br>All in all, good, but like I said, I've got a blue-trousered Han already, and another dozen or so other versions. I don't know where to put him. Still, the version I've got already came with the pricey full sized Falcon, so I suppose this is an affordable version.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Good, chunky chibi version of the ship</li><li>Nice selection of parts at a decent price</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The chibi stylings are polarising - so ignore this con if you like them!</li><li>The odd boat stud placement makes the ship tip up - a slight design oversight</li></ul>
<p>Like the other microfighters this is a well made and chunky ship that young fans will be sure to enjoy swooshing. Strangely for such an exciting and iconic ship I found it quite underwhelming, but it does what it needs to, so I guess this isn't a review that is trying to convince you of anything: if you were thinking of getting it, go ahead; if you weren't fussed, don't bother!</p>",TRUE,3,5,3,3,5
"lkb57","2014-04-23T05:43:26.467Z","The Fastest Chibi in the Galaxy","<p>This isn&#39;t a big set, so this won&#39;t be a big review. Like many of you, I wasn&#39;t expecting much when I first saw the images of the &quot;Microfighter&quot; sets. I got this set as a present, and was surprised at how much I liked it. Granted, Han isn&#39;t exactly a rare minifig, but since he&#39;s my favorite character, it&#39;s always fun to get another variant of him. And the ship itself . . . well, it surpassed my expectations! It&#39;s a relatively simple build, but comes with a surprising collection of interesting parts. My favorite has to be the printed &quot;droid-head&quot; cockpit piece which will be an awesome addition to MOCs like <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/marshal-banana/4694133369/in/photostream/"">this</a>. Hands down, my favorite aspect of this set is that it is a great bridge between my own Lego interests and the interests of my kid . . . we can both enjoy swooshing this little ship around together.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a Star Wars collector, this set is a must-buy. If you&#39;re a serious MOCer, this set will also be a welcome addition. And the great thing is, at ~10 cents per piece, this set definitely won&#39;t break the bank. Buy it!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:23:23.62Z","Strongest Series 1 Microfighter, Highly Impressive","<p><strong>Set #75030 Millennium Falcon: </strong>One of the best Microfighters from the first series. This is the only one that doesn&rsquo;t have a generic character for the Minifigure. The parts in this set are really impressive, I love the Astromech dome with the cockpit window printing, but let&rsquo;s save some of this for that actual review. Let&rsquo;s get on to the fun of this set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Han Solo: A brand new print for Han with this Minifigure, but it isn&rsquo;t unique to this set anymore. When it first came out it was unique to this set, but now you can find him in the Mos Eisley Cantina set. He comes with an awesome double-sided torso print, the leg printing with the holster strap on the front and his great facial print. His weapon is the small blaster, LEGO really seems to love this new sculpt piece for many of these sets.</p>

<p><strong>The Microfighter &amp; Build</strong></p>

<p>Building this little Millennium Falcon is a real treat, the design is just fun, it captures the look of the ship quite nicely. Except of course the cockpit for Han to sit in that is just an open seat, but it works in this scale, seriously these microfighters are an awesome successor to the old Planet series. I really hope LEGO will continue this line into the next year.</p>

<p>The distinctive look of the ship is all there, the radar dish, the cockpit in the front, the shape of the vehicle itself. There are two flick-fire missiles on the top where the upper quad gun would go. These missiles are great, the trouble is that you can&rsquo;t access them too well, so firing them are a bit difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Buy this set, I can&rsquo;t say this enough. The Millennium Falcon microfighter is the one set where I can&rsquo;t recommend it enough, and if you can only buy one microfighter than I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a tossup between this one or the Star Destroyer. So if you can only buy one, get two, this one for sure and the Star Destroyer to fight him.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-08-01T23:03:37.23Z","Best Microfighter Model","<p>Well hi there :), Previously in February 2018 I happily reveiwed the 2018 Millennium Falcon Microfighter, now I&rsquo;m going to review the original. It came out in 2014 has 94 parts and retailed for &pound;8.99 or $9.99 meaning the Price Per Part is 9p or 10c. The set has 1 figure and a build, enough talking let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>In the 2018 version of this set it included a awesome Chewbacca&nbsp;but the original contained a great 2014 Han Solo figure who has his old round short hair in brown a double sided face one showing happiness and the other showing him focused.</p>

<p>His torso has his black jacket with pockets and folds on top of a tan shirt. Finally his legs and hip has a belt.</p>

<p>He is holding a short black blaster as his accessory.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The Millennium Falcon is similar to the remake but has some minor difference some of which i think are better than the newest. This build is based on the original trilogy so has the round radar using a dish piece next to the radar are the old flick missiles with a red tip.</p>

<p>The ships body is extremely like the newer one externals like the engine which is identical and the iconic front is like for like apart from minor colour switches,&nbsp;the 1x1 round tiles in silver rather than black. As the internal build goes it&rsquo;s very odd in terms of colours as there&rsquo;s a black 2x4 brick and 3 1x1 trans red cones. The black brick means the engine is very dark while the 2018&rsquo;s&nbsp;has a white 2x4 brightening up the engine which i though was odd.</p>

<p>My favourite&nbsp;area is the cockpit which is connected via a 2x4 L plate in a dark bluish gray&nbsp;colour, In the cockpit is place for Han Solo to sit comfortably with arm rests which the 2018 lacked, also there&rsquo;s a trans white 1x1 cheese slop for a window. at the tip of the cockpit an exclusive astromech droid head in gray with the print of a windscreen which was also in the 2018 one but was printed in dark gray while this sets was in a black print.</p>

<p>Oh there&rsquo;s also 4 2x2 round plates with a 2x2 inverted round tile for a little less friction and also looks like the landing legs.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The set is a lot like the recent version but there&rsquo;s something about this build that i love that the 2018 one lacks. I love the cockpit as it has a better fit for the figure as they don&rsquo;t flick out while the recent on tends to. There aren&rsquo;t to many features but the build is very swooshable&nbsp;as nothing breaks off so its extremely sturdy and the flick missiles are nice but would preferred the stud shooters as they were just released in Jan 2014 when this came out. Also Han Solo is a great character to have.</p>

<p>So if you want this i&rsquo;d say get the 2018 as it&rsquo;s extremely similar minus a few minor changes such as figure, radar dish, the shooting system and few colours changed. If i&rsquo;m right the new one has only 1 or 2 elements more than this.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great figure to include, Great sturdiness, Better cockpit than the remake, Looks accurate to the iconic ship.</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Could had the stud shooters instead of flick missiles but nothing major to complain about.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed for a Han Solo Movie versions in microfighter form.</p>
