"zipsforbananas","2014-01-14T12:35:18.383Z","The planet series has grown up... and got younger?!","<p>This is a funny review to write, because when I first saw the chibi fighter series I hated them, and I still don't really like them, but these sets have got a lot going for them!<br>(It will also be very similar to the X-Wing and Star Destroyer reviews - especially the <b>chibi look</b>&nbsp;section...)</p><p>The whole <b>chibi look </b>is a love-it-or-hate-it-thing, so obviously you'll either love it or hate it! This set does a very good job of portraying the TIE Interceptor in chibi fashion, so chibi fans will adore it. I found it kinda cute, but these will be the first sets I've ever built and stored straight away. For my sensibilities they just don't cut it for display alongside the other sets. Read into that what you like, I've a feeling the AFOL community will be split on this one, and I'm sure KFOLs will love the sets.</p><p>If you like the look, the set is a real success. If you don't though, what's it got for you?</p><p>Well, <b>the figure </b>is a(nother) brand new design (as if we haven't had enough TIE pilots!), with printed legs (seemingly everywhere in 2014! The Death Star Gunners and the chibi Star Destroyer figure have them), a far more detailed torso than before, and possibly the best helmet yet - with silver outlining, but not as much as the OTT TIE Bomber pilot from the planet set. Curiously he's got a flesh coloured head too, with a great aggressive expression. I prefer this to the banal and pale clone face on recent efforts, but there is a lot of flesh visible around the back of the helmet for an all black figure.</p><p>But the real triumph of these chibi sets is the <b>parts selection</b>. These are the first Star Wars sets I've given full marks to on value for a long time. I suppose a lot of the parts are quite small, but it's still a delight to get parts for less than 10p each! And the parts you get are great, possibly the best concentration of interesting MOC parts that I've come across.<br>There's one of the relatively new 4x4 round plates with a 2x2 round hole in the middle in light grey, and a 4x4 dark transparent dish with cockpit printing on (no stickers! Woo!). That cockpit piece should look at home next to the TIE Advanced in the Death Star set (10188), I think it might even be the same part. There are also four of the new 1x2x2/3 stepped slopes, five of the fairly new 2x2 Studs Not On Bottom pieces in dark grey, and four dark grey 1x2 plates with 2 studs on the side going upwards.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>If you like chibi, it's a great rendition</li><li>It's chunky, swooshable, and has a couple of flick fire missiles</li><li>The parts selection is excellent with a lot of interesting pieces</li><li>The figure is the usual excellent standard, though it's hard to get excited about another TIE pilot</li><li>Much better value than Star Wars sets usually give (it's still high of course though)</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>The chibi style won't be a hit with everyone</li></ul>
<p>There's nothing not to like unless you don't like chibi! (Have I mentioned that enough yet? :P) Of course another TIE pilot is underwhelming too, but he's as well done as he could be (unless you don't like the flesh head), and the set is great for parts, and decent value given that it is both a Star Wars and a pocket money set.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5

<p>Box is nice, I also like the detail on the pilot a lot. Something I hadn&#39;t seen before was the minifig size blaster. Might have been around for a while, just hadn&#39;t seen it. It&#39;s the design of the ship that bothers me a lot. I&#39;m a huge fan of Star Wars universe, not just the original six movies, and hence the idea of a convertible fused to a starcraft makes me feel uneasy.</p>

<p>As a building experience this is regular Lego: small model with a few weird angles. The overall build is a bit flimsy. The joints that attach wings to the body are relatively alright for the weight and size of this model. The laser cannons at the ends of the wings are binoculars which in general are horrible at staying in place. Watch out for not losing them. The body is fairly rigid but the front dish is attached using basically just one knob, so that might be an issue too.</p>

<p>From a playability point of view I&#39;m not sure how I would play with this. I do understand the idea of this style and I know little kids will know how to play with this but for an adult it&#39;s just plain weird. It has got two weapons that seem to double as light turrets and missiles, which is a fresh idea.</p>

<p>However, this set is excellent parts and within some hours of receiving this set I mashed it together with a 8028 TIE Fighter to get a reasonably good TIE Interceptor. I was even left over with some other really funky parts that I liked. Some good catches: round 4x4&nbsp;knobbed piece with a round hole in the middle, the four smooth two-elevation plates on wings and square smooth bottom-plates on wings.</p>

<p>Overall I would say that if you are like me, do not build this. It will only bring sadness. Use it for parts, for something else as it&#39;s got some really funky and nice parts. If you like this style then there&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with this model!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Average box and instructions, nothing much to say about these.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are probably not going to be used for much, considering how small they are, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the main draw of this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I love TIE fighter pilots. There&#39;s not enough that can be said about how cool they looked in the films and how great LEGO&#39;s effort has been in trying to recreate these characters in minifigure form. I absolutely love this minifigure, with printing on its back, legs, and helmet. The clone flesh heads I don&#39;t mind at all.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I have to say, when I was building this set, I was actually having fun doing it. It&#39;s probably odd that such a small set could give me that much pleasure during the construction phase...but I loved it. Not too much that is&nbsp;repetitive&nbsp;other than the wings, which are brilliant. Fairly accurate to the movie portrayals. Evidently, this isn&#39;t supposed to be the actual ship, which I actually give a lot of bonus points for.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As I said, it&#39;s not supposed to be the actual TIE Interceptor, but I love the design. It can fit your little pilot inside, riding it as a sort of chubby speeder. I suppose this is an area solely based on someone&#39;s preference of what a good set should be.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>You can push the little flick fire missiles if you want or just place the little thing on yor desk to display. Honestly, get it. It doesn&#39;t cost too much to buy and&nbsp;it&#39;s pretty worth it, at least for me.&nbsp;</p>
