"zipsforbananas","2014-01-14T12:58:43.47Z","Oh no! I shrunk my X-Wing! Hand me that tyre pump, I'll try and inflate it...","<p>This is another funny review to write, because I hated the chibi fighter series&nbsp;when I first saw&nbsp;them, and I'm still not really a fan, but they've actually got a lot going for them!<br>(It will also be very similar to the TIE Interceptor and Star Destroyer reviews - especially the&nbsp;<b>chibi look</b>&nbsp;section...)</p><p>That inflated&nbsp;<b>chibi look&nbsp;</b>is a love-it-or-hate-it-thing, so obviously you'll either love it or hate it! This set does a very good job of portraying the X-Wing in chibi fashion, so chibi fans will adore it. I do think it's kinda cute, but these sets will be the first ones I've ever built and stored straight away. They just don't cut it for display alongside the other sets to my mind. Read into that what you like, I've a feeling the AFOL community will be split on this one, and I'm sure KFOLs will love the sets.</p><p>If you chibi, the set is great. But what's it got for you if you don't?</p><p>Well,&nbsp;<b>the figure&nbsp;</b>is yet another improvement on the Rebel X-Wing Pilot. The leg printing is even better than on the Snowspeeder Pilot and Luke from last year, and the torso is the same, as well being the first really great printed torso with dark grey hands. I hesitate to say it as they keep improving, but this may be the version you need to get 100 of if you want to upgrade all your old figure's torsos and legs. The face has the same really great visor detailing of last year's figures, no more of the old flat orange. And he's got two expressions: a standard serious look, and a slightly over-the-top terrified face, as if he's about to crash! (Perhaps OTT in keeping with the chibi stylings?) And his helmet is fantastic as we've come to expect, with crisp printing, and a metallic finish to the grey sections. I'm sure we've not had this helmet print attempted before, and I think it's accurate to one of the pilots in the films, which is always a bonus in my book!<br>The astromech head kinda has to go here too. I may be wrong but I believe it's a new print with dark green detailing (there's not been one in an OT set at least, I don't know about the prequels, clone wars, expanded universe etc). It doesn't actually seem to fit too well with the green astromech body I've got (eek! Something not OT in my collection! I'm a hypocrite!) but swapping out an old head with the rubbish printing that only got halfway down from in my old Y-Wing works well enough. I'm sure many people will think it's a great piece to have.</p><p>And that introduces the real triumph of these chibi sets: the&nbsp;<b>parts selection</b>. As I said in the TIE Interceptor review, these are the first Star Wars sets I've given full marks to on value for a long time, a lot of small parts of course, but still a delight to get them for less than 10p each! And though this X-Wing set isn't as great as the other two chibis I got, the parts are still great, with a lot of MOC type parts.<br>There aren't actually any of the SNOT pieces that you would hope a small build like this would be full of. But there are a lot of 2x2 clips and holders, a few nice dark red pieces, and four (five with the spare) of the white round 1x1 plates with a hole in the middle. I think I saw Huw say these have been out a while in game sets, but they're the first I've seen, designers might well now be allowed to use them in other themes. The most exciting parts are the new 1x2 plates with Technic clips on. You get four in dark grey, and eight in white!<br>And it's hardly a huge deal, but the piece used for the nose deserves a mention, given how awful the nose was on the last X-Wing (the UCS one)!&nbsp;</p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>If you like chibi, it's a great rendition</li><li>It's chunky, swooshable, and the four guns can be used as flick fire missiles</li><li>The parts selection is good with quite a few interesting pieces</li><li>The figure is really excellent, yet another improvement on the X-Wing Pilot</li><li>Much better value than Star Wars sets usually give (it's still high of course though)</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>The chibi style won't be a hit with everyone - ignore that con if you like it!</li></ul><p>If you like chibi, there's nothing not to like! We've been waiting for this X-Wing Pilot as last year's Hoth sets raised the bar on the orange jumpsuits, and surprisingly this figure's done it again! It's a great set for parts too, and given that it is both a Star Wars and a pocket money set it's pretty decent value.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5

I decided to keep the astromech head for MOCing too (shame there was no body supplied).</p><p>As the X-Wing was now without pilot (much to my 3 year son's displeasure) I added a spare Luke Skywalker in pilot garb and added Artoo's head too - My son rushed off with it swooshing it about and then landed it in the docking bay of our Death Star. It immediately dawned upon me how brilliant these MicroFighters are in conjunction with a play set like the Death Star!</p><p>Whilst the Death Star is a very impressive set, there's no way you could swoosh a minifigure scale X-Wing along the equator of the fully operational battle station to drop a proton torpedo in the exhaust port - you can with the MicroFighter!&nbsp;</p><p>We'll have to build some more X-Wings for Biggs and Porkins. We also intend getting the MicroFighter Tie Interceptor and Millennium Falcon too - the Falcon looks to fit in the Death Star's hanger bay quite nicely in stark comparison to the minifigure sized Falcon!</p><p>My son has a grin ear to ear.</p>",TRUE,5,2,3,5,4
"Joshjhamilton","2015-03-14T22:56:06.73Z","Overall good, for a Microfighter","<p>Overall, I&#39;m not a big fan of the Microfighters. &nbsp;They pretty much replaced the Planet Series, which were more accurate to scale. &nbsp;But, this is a pretty good one.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is accurate to what you get and the instructions are clear. &nbsp;My 7 year old daughters were able to put this together with very little assistance.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts count is good for the price. &nbsp;The only complaint is that the astromech is just a head. But, to be fair, I don&#39;t think it could have fit a full astromech. &nbsp;If I wanted to make it more accurate ... it&#39;s Lego, so it can always be &quot;fixed&quot;. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think I will, since it&#39;s going to go on a shelf next to similar sized ships, for &quot;playtime&quot; with younger Lego fans. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll complain.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is where the set really shines. &nbsp;The figure, described as &quot;Rebel Pilot&quot; is a hidden gem, using the helmet design for &quot;Red Ten&quot; Theron Nett. &nbsp;If you&#39;re a collector of Red Squadron/ Rogue Squadron, this set is a must have. &nbsp;The details on Star Wars minifigures keep getting better each year, and this is no exception. &nbsp;The pants are the best detailed I&#39;ve seen for any X-Wing pilot, the head is reversable with two expressions, and the helmet is a dead-on replica of Theron Nett&#39;s from the movie.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As stated above, no issues. &nbsp;The instructions were clear, and none of it was terribly difficult.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Completed, this is a sturdy brick that is very playable, especially for younger Lego fans. &nbsp;It is clearly recognizable as an X-Wing. &nbsp;No, it&#39;s not anywhere near being in scale, but that&#39;s not the point. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&#39;d prefer that Lego go back to making their Planet Series, but that&#39;s not likely to happen. &nbsp;For a Microfighter, this one is very good. &nbsp;</p>

"frankandrandy","2014-12-30T22:10:56.07Z","More chibi than chibi.","<p>Among the most chibi of the microfighters line, still a great interpretation of a classic ship.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>These boxes aren&#39;t foldable for storage. Too bad. The instructions are instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As noted by CaptianRex in his review, now that the 2014 Advent Calendar is out&nbsp;astromech head becomes an amazing piece since it matches the Christmas tree droid perfectly. Past that, the pink studs are nice and the four white studs with holes are increasingly useful.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Like other reviewers mentioned, Lego keeps improving on the rebel pilots. Five stars.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As small as the set is building the wings four times is repetitive. You get an x-wing out of it though, so can&#39;t complain.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The pilot bumps his head against&nbsp;the droid a bit. Otherwise, a clean, fun set with moving parts and loads of playability (even without flick fires, which would ruin the look I feel).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Second best set for Series 1, barely behind the Millennium&nbsp;Falcon. Get one.</p>

"Brickaddict221","2014-05-09T22:20:12.04Z","X-wing Starfighter ","<p>Today I will be reviewing the X-wing Starfighter set 75032. Well let&#39;s get on to the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and instructions are tiny since this is a tiny set. The box has the micro fighter logo on it. Other than that not much else to say.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a lot of cool parts. It has 4 hinge pieces, 4 triangle wing pieces , a astromech droid head and 4 white pieces I&#39;ve never seen before in a set.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Minifigures</span></p>

<p>This set comes with 1 minifig&nbsp;like all other Microfighter sets. He is the X-wing pilot he has the orange torso and legs. The legs have printing of tubes which go up to the torso printing the torso printing are also of tubes and has a ton of detail. The torso also has a vest and a control panel full of buttons and levers. He has an all new double-sided head. His head has a serious expression and a angry/scared expression too. His head also has goggles printed on with an orange tint. His helmet has all new print too. All together he is one of the coolest figures 2014 has brought to the Star Wars theme so far this year.</p>

<p>This set also has an astromech head too. It is a green theme but not much to say on that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is both fun and quick like Microfighters are.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model has 4 flick missiles,a place where the pilot can sit, and 4 turbo engines in the back. It has a place where the droid head can snap on. It has 4 log like gray pieces too. The four wings can also go up and down.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All together this set is 1 word... AWESOME!!! With one great figure and one great build you can&#39;t get any better. Definitely one of the best Microfighters.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:25:15.437Z","Red Ten Standing By.","<p><strong>Set #75032 X-Wing Starfighter: </strong>This is one of the best Microfighters from Series 1, seriously if you don&rsquo;t care for the designs or the sets at all this one and the Star Destroyer are really high on my recommended list, and I&rsquo;ll explain why in the following reviews.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Rebel Pilot: Unnamed, this brilliant looking Minifigure has the standard double-sided torso and leg printing found on most Rebel Pilots, it also features a small hand blaster and a double-sided face. The helmet is a real treat with some awesome printing. This is a perfect Minifigure for troop building.</p>

<p><strong>The Microfighter &amp; Build</strong></p>

<p>This microfighter looks great, it suitably captures the likeness of the x-wing and the build is really quite fun. True it is a bit repetitive, however the design is so cute and fun to play with it&rsquo;s one of the real reasons I really started getting into these Microfighters. The flick-fire missiles are the four cannons on the wings this time, which some fans might be against, but honestly it&rsquo;s really not that bad.</p>

<p>What I really like about this microfighter is the inclusion of an Astromech dome for the rear section of the fighter, it gives you half an extra Minifigure in the set. The best aspect of this set is the fact that you can purchase multiples of it to make a small army of them, and this set is really one of the stronger offerings from the series.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>I strongly recommend this set to any fans of the Star Wars theme and rebel army building. This snubfighter is really snub, heh, heh. Honestly the only downside to this set is that they didn&rsquo;t include a torso and legs for the Astromech, if they had this would have been the best offering yet because it would have meant cheaply army building Astromechs. As it stands it&rsquo;s a great set still, and I can&rsquo;t praise it enough, if you haven&rsquo;t gotten one yet do yourself a favour and pick it up.</p>

"ra226","2015-05-25T21:38:23.95Z","Pleasantly surprised: cute, clever, and playable","<p>I have to admit, when the Microfighters line was first unveiled, I was relieved--relieved because it was one less thing I&#39;d need to worry about spending my money on. &nbsp;But as a sort-of X-Wing collector (for whatever reason, I seem to have most of them, clear back to #7140), I was compelled to pick this one up.</p>

<p>The Planets line (which this line has supplanted)&nbsp;were clearly designed to be display pieces. &nbsp;These, on the other hand, are meant to be swooshed&nbsp;around and played with, evidenced by the fact&nbsp;that the minifigs can actually sit in these. &nbsp;Being a children&#39;s toy, I completely understand why Lego went this route, though I&nbsp;enjoyed the Planets series myself.</p>

<p>The first thing anyone will notice is the distinct styling on these. &nbsp;It&#39;s Japanese&nbsp;in origin, and you&#39;ll see it called both&nbsp;Chibi or Super-deformed. &nbsp;They have exagerated features and are&nbsp;generally very cute looking. &nbsp;But now having built it, I can say there&#39;s a lot more to this&nbsp;than the styling. &nbsp;The colorings are perfect, with touches of dark red. &nbsp;There are a lot of clever uses of parts and SNOT techniques like the engine mountings and reversed parts for the lower wings. &nbsp;I&#39;m very impressed at how, both open and closed, the wings line up at the correct angles perfectly.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The minifig pilot has some excellent detailing, with a two-sided head (&quot;determined&quot; and &quot;they came.. from... behind!&quot;), decorated front-and-back torso, and decorated legs and hips. &nbsp;His helmet is a new design, and he&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">comes with a cute chibi-styled&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">blaster, too (</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">compare to the one in #9493)</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">.</span></p>

<p>Playability is very good for set this size. &nbsp;The laser canons are also flick-fire missiles (I don&#39;t actually know if kids use these, but sure, why not...), folding wings, and even a clip in the aft section to hold the blaster. &nbsp;I&#39;ve never seen an X-Wing pilot wielding a blaster in the movies,&nbsp;and yet Lego always includes one with their pilots.</p>

<p>I was actually pleasantly surprised by this little set. &nbsp;Not enough to pick up the others, but enough to appreciate the clever design and unique styling Lego was going for. &nbsp;Maybe pick a couple up for a young Star Wars fan--I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll love them. &nbsp;And if you&#39;ve ever used the phrase &quot;pew, pew, pew!&quot; then pick one up for yourself, too. &nbsp;And be thankful I didn&#39;t follow my original intent and write this entire review in Lol-speak.</p>

<p>Parts: The R2 Unit dome is useful for ships like Jedi Fighters and V-Wing if you use a convincing lower body. The studs used on the wingtips are unusual and very useful, at least to me.</p>

<p>Minifigures: Red Ten, Theron Nett. He was shot down by TIEs&nbsp;over Yavin and the Death Star. HIs Astromech,&nbsp;R2-X2 is black and white, while this one is green and white, which does dissapoint me. Red Ten, on the other hand, looks magnificent.</p>

<p>The build: I bought the set for the minifigure and I was pleasantly surprised&nbsp;at this micro T-65 X-Wing, It is sturdy, accurate, and I thoroughly enjoyed building it. The wings surprisingly&nbsp;look very nice in attack or cruising position. The only flaw is flick-missiles, the worse invention TLG ever made! I am not as mad about flick missiles on this because it would be impractical to put spring-loaded shooters on this but stud-shooters might have made more useful.</p>

<p>Overall opinion: This set is my first Microfighter, but&nbsp;definitely not the last! I have seen how tough these little fighters are too. They are as sturdy as the original and then some, and they look spectacular on display as well.</p>
