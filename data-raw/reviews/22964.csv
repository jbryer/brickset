"zipsforbananas","2014-01-14T13:23:19.477Z","For essentially a flat wedge it's actually quite a good Star Destroyer!","<p>This is my third funny review to write, and last for now (I haven't got the Falcon yet), because I hated these chibi fighters when I first saw&nbsp;them, and I still don't like them, but there's a lot else too like in these sets!<br>(It will also be very similar to the TIE Interceptor and X-Wing reviews - especially the&nbsp;<b>chibi look</b>&nbsp;section...)</p><p>That babyish, chunky, out-of-scale&nbsp;<b>chibi look&nbsp;</b>is a love-it-or-hate-it-thing, so obviously you'll either love it or hate it! And chibi or not, this is actually quite a nice way to represent a Star Destroyer. It is kinda cute, but these sets will be the first ones I've ever built and stored straight away. I just don't think they look right alongside my other sets. Read into that what you like, I've a feeling the AFOL community will be split on this one, and I'm sure KFOLs will love the sets.</p><p>So it's a great chibi set. But if you're not a chibi lover, what's it got?</p><p>I imagine a lot people will be unimpressed by&nbsp;<b>the figure</b>, but I love him!<br>He's got the same printed legs as all the OT black trousered figures this year, but they're nice. He's got the same torso as the Death Star Gunners too, and I should have checked, but I think the head is the same as one of theirs too (serious look, microphone coming down from the hat). And the hat is fairly unremarkable, I think there were some in the build-a-minifigure bit in the Lego shop the other week. All together he's pretty much a black version of the Imperial officer we've seen quite a few of down the years. But that's a real plus in my book! His printing is better than any of those dark grey figures had, marginal maybe, but it's a plus. And the microphone on his cheek is distinctive too. And of course, if you're going to man your Imperial troops you need some of these guys, maybe just to drag away the latest Vader-choke victim, but need them you do!</p><p>And as with the other chibi sets, the real success is the&nbsp;<b>parts selection</b>. These are the first Star Wars sets I've given full marks to on value for a long time, and this is the best value of the three I've got at 100 pieces. It might just be me imagining it, but they seem bigger too. (Curiously the main of the two bags was bigger than in the other two sets, and full of air so it filled the box.)<br>There are a lot of MOC type parts too.<br>There are I think six of the 1x2 plates with 4 2x2 studs going down from the side, as well as the old 1x2 with 4 1x4 that used to be the front end of cars all the time. The collection of 1x2x2 light grey slopes seem appealing, there are two 1x2 trans red plates, and all the 1x1 grey round plates are in a dark metallic silver too, which I imagine are relatively rare. Plus you get a 3x3 tile in dark grey - still a novelty to me, having wanted to use one so often when I was young!<br>The four 1x2 with one stud jumper plates in light grey are the newer design with the new underside with just a few bumps in from the side to hold studs in place. All they improve on the old ones that I can think of is being able to have any stud at all in the middle, not just a hollow one (like on a Technic brick), and maybe gripping a tile put in sideways, though I'm sure that's an illegal technique. Not a huge plus, and curious that the dark grey 1x2 jumpers in the same set are the old style.</p><p>This is the one of the three I got where <b>the build </b>is worth a special mention too. The main body is built sideways, and the way the seat for the figure is attached, which gives the vehicle added strength, and the way the bridge and engines are attached and pieces fit around each other are really great (only a few gaps) and I'm sure would inspire budding MOCers with ideas for SNOT.</p><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>If you like chibi, it's a decent rendition</li><li>It's chunky and swooshable with two flick fire missiles (should a Star Destroyer be swooshed&nbsp;though?)</li><li>The parts selection is great with some interesting pieces and lots of SNOT</li><li>The figure is great, a valuable addition to my Imperial troops</li><li>Much better value than Star Wars sets usually give, and the best of this range so far</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>The chibi style won't be a hit with everyone - if you like it, ignore that con!</li></ul><p>If you're a chibi fan there's nothing not to like! It's a great set for parts as the others are in this range, and given that it is both a Star Wars and a pocket money set it's pretty decent value. And though I imagine the figure won't be liked by all, especially maybe KFOLs, he gives the set a bit more AFOL appeal than it would otherwise have had.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,3,5
"XerxesDGreat","2014-03-04T06:26:20.7Z","Lots of bang for the (ten) bucks!","<p>For a chibi-styled&nbsp;Star Destroyer, one couldn&#39;t ask for much more! Sure, it slaps together quickly (my wife said &quot;you&#39;re done already?&quot;), and sure it doesn&#39;t look realistic, but that&#39;s not really the point of it. This is intended to be a little toy version, essentially giving the impression of a Star Destroyer. This hits quite well on that point; it boils all the.... the &quot;Star Destroyer-iness&quot; of the larger models and boils it down to this caricature. To that end, it&#39;s a great deal of fun. Plus, I&#39;m able to play with it with my 2-year-old daughter, so that raises the marks for it considerably. As for pieces, it&#39;s got some pretty useful pieces, especially the right-angle ones with a 2x2 plate and a 3x3 plate I&#39;ve never seen before. &nbsp;All in all, satisfied with my purchase. Wish the build lasted longer, but what can one expect from 100 pieces?</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:27:16.513Z","Build a Tiny Fleet of Imperial Captial Ships","<p><strong>Set #75033 Star Destroyer:</strong> This was my first Microfighter and it sold me on these little designs that are awesome and really fun, especially this version of the Star Destroyer. Why exactly? Well I&rsquo;ll try to explain in this review, with that being said let&rsquo;s get started.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Imperial Crew: This Minifigure is unique to this set and a really impressive looking one. He&rsquo;s got an awesome double-printed torso and leg printing with the Imperial uniform in black. There are no rank markings on him though. His facial print includes a pilot communication device, and his head gear is the awesome looking hat. He includes a small blaster pistol, this is a great looking Minifigure and a huge draw for this set as he&rsquo;s rare and unique to the set.</p>

<p><strong>The Microfighter &amp; Build</strong></p>

<p>Building this set makes for a fairly interesting design. It&rsquo;s also slightly repetitive, however the technique used to make this micro-scaled Star Destroyer is really enjoyable. I love how they&rsquo;ve made the standard wedge shape, and the control tower is just a brilliantly designed build.</p>

<p>The Microfighter is loads of fun to just play with, it has a decent grip which allows you to swish it through the air. And the flick-fire missiles are integrated quite nicely, without getting too in the way of the overall design of the vehicle. Ultimately this is one of the best microfighters from the series so far.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Strongly recommended. If you haven&rsquo;t picked one up yet you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. The Minifigure is unique to this set, and if you buy more than just one, you can army build. The number of pieces in this set are also pretty decent and will definitely be useful for many MOC enthusiasts.</p>

"lkb57","2014-07-01T21:36:17.83Z","(Tiny) Hammer of the Empire","<p>To be honest, I wasn&#39;t planning on buying this set. Besides the Millennium Falcon (which I already owned)&nbsp;&nbsp;X-wing, TIE Interceptor were the only other Microfighters I wanted to shell money out for. But I received it as a gift, and was definitely pleasantly surprised. The build is surprisingly fun and the highly-detailed minifig makes for a great addition to any Imperial Army. This is a small set, so I&#39;ll limit myself to the following details:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The build was actually pretty enjoyable, since it utilized a lot of SNOT techniques to create the basic triangular shape of the Star Destroyer and the distinctive bridge area. Additionally, the set includes enough details to keep you interested during the entire build. The finished set is instantly recognizable.</li>
	<li>The minifigure is great . . . a highly detailed Imperial Navy Officer. We&#39;ve already seen some captains and even admirals in other sets, so it&#39;s nice to get a more junior officer who wouldn&#39;t look out of place in a MOC of a Star Destroyer bridge.</li>
	<li>My only complaints: 1) the bottom of the ship is VERY plain, and 2) the rest of the microfighters&nbsp;are based off of small-ish vehicles that are near &quot;fighter&quot; size in the movies . . . but the Star Destroyer definitely isn&#39;t. It&#39;s a huge ship, and it just looks weird placing it next to a similarly sized Millenium Falcon. Oh well . . .</li>
</ul>

<p>Do I recommend this set? Well, if you&#39;re collecting the Microfighters then you&#39;ll want it, just for completeness&#39; sake. Otherwise, I&#39;d save you&#39;re pennies and grab the Millenium&nbsp;Falcon instead.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box was small: this standard microfighter size. Instructions were easy to follow as in the other microfighter sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This has not exclusive parts but a few really nice one still.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This as the other microfighters has one minifigure and this time it&acute;s the Imperial Officer. It has some printings and kind of cap on it&acute;s head.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this was easy so nothing very special to say here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is cool though quite small to be an Imperial Star Destroyer.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this Microfighter thing and this is a nice-to-have set for a LEGO SW collector.</p>
