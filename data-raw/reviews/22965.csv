What an honour that is...<div><br></div><div>In a word, its brilliant. I've never owned an Episode III style pseudo - TIE Fighter designed fighter craft and missed out on the 2008 iteration. This one reminds me of the opening scene from the Battle of Coruscant in the prequel as well a brings to mind Anakin's fateful last flight to the volcanic world that would finally give rise to the iconic version of Darth Vader...</div><div><br></div><div>I guess other Bricklinkers will review this in more detail but I'll stick to the main brief factoids I feel are important to know:</div><div><br></div><div>The spring fire mechanisms are powerful. I wonder if they'll cease them as quickly as they've brought them out as they could be unsuitable for smaller children.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The plates used to build the movable wings is intricate, well, I thought it was and takes time to do if you want to correctly position and overlap plates as instructed.</div><div><br></div><div>Theres some nice spare parts, usual 1x1 studs and the black 'lightsaber handle' style 'lazer barrels that could make for nice Sith Lightsaber handles if you have a spare translucent red rod or two.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I also was pleased that the Old Republic insignia 1 x 1 stud had a spare, so added that to the other wing to create some nice symmetry that the instructions and images on all Star Wars material pertaining to the craft don't do design wise.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>R2 - D2 is a 'new' figure. I guess that means new tampo printed parts and he can sit inside the wing as the Fighters Astro Mech without needing to remove his head from his body. The cockpit can hold Anakins Lightsaber with two clips. &nbsp;Anakin himself is a 'new' figure and I like him. His 'tough' face is better imo than his 'worried' look.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There are the stickers as usual, I don't gripe much about these as there aren't that many. All in all its a brilliant set around the size of last years A-WING FIGHTER.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I recommend buying it. Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"Theswedishlegoboy","2014-04-06T13:27:15.057Z","This where the fun begins...design.desse","<p>I bought this set in March 2014, and it had a low price, too, 38$, so i&#39;m pleased with the price.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box has the same size as all other 53$ sets this year, and inside are: 2 numbered bags, a sticker sheet and an instruction manual. The sticker sheet does not have many stickers and i&#39;m pleased with that. The stickers are:</p>

<p>S-foils (4)</p>

<p>Ship controls (1)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Republic sign (2)</p>

<p>In total, there&#39;s 7 stickers.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set includes some really nice parts, like the new spring- loaded shooters, the S-foils and the Cockpit window. I also like the 1x1&nbsp;Jedi sign.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>both minifigures are new and exclusive, but has appeared in other sets, but with other design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>=ANAKIN SKYWALKER=</p>

<p>This minifigure is my favorite in this set, because it has nice Episode III design. It is as often 2- faced, a satisfied expression and an angry expression. it has the normal anakin hair from 2008, but it&#39;s dark brown instead of light brown. Both faces have a headset.</p>

<p>=R2-D2=</p>

<p>This minifigure&nbsp;is made of the same pecies as normal, but they have other design. The legs are the same as normal, but the body and the head have a diffirent design.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are no parts in the build worth mentioning, except &nbsp;the S- foils and the guns.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like this set very much, but there is one thing i&#39;m not satisfied with and it&#39;s the back. i really don&#39;t like how the back looks, but if lego would design it so that the back looks better the cockpit wouldn&#39;t open.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5</p>

<p>Building experience: 5/5</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are the high point of this set. The new Anakin Skywalker is a sharp-looking figure, and the new R2-D2 is vastly superior to its predecessors.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>My biggest complaint is the cockpit. While you can&#39;t see the interior very well from the pictures,&nbsp;it&#39;s ugly beyond description. The control panel sticker seems like an afterthought, and there is very little room for Anakin to sit, especially with his lightsaber stowed behind him. While I keep almost all my sets as-is, I highly recommend designing your own cockpit on this one.</p>

<p>The wings are what you see; a bit blocky and complicated, but not bad overall. Not enough dark gray for my taste, but that&#39;s just me, and the wings are easy to customize.</p>

<p>The main cannons, though simple, look quite nice. Additionally, the new spring launchers work well and blend nicely into the build.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The previous version of this fighter (the one that came with a vulture droid) has a much better cockpit design than the new one; indeed, the new cockpit is simply horrible. If&nbsp;you have the parts to make your own cockpit and customize the wings to your liking, though,&nbsp;this set may be worth the money.</p>

"eSkywalker","2014-12-27T23:46:39.31Z","Nice little set, good for the price, impressed with minifigures","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Small, classic, $30 sized box, but is slightly wider than most others.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good variety of parts and the new spring-loaded missiles work really well. They shoot surprisingly far.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>My favourite part of the set by far are the minifigures. R2 has a darker silver head than we&#39;ve seen which is nice to have to prevent duplicates with other sets. Anakin is really neat. He has the small gold headset on which is very movie-accurate and a dual printed face. Good printing on the torso but only little black parts on the upper part of his legs. His left hand is flesh coloured and his right is black because it is mechanical hand.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Average build; first we build the base of the cockpit, then the right wing, then the left, and lastly place&nbsp;clear cockpit piece. There a quite a few stickers, some large and some small which is unfortunate because placing stickers has never been my strong suit and is difficult for younger builders that this set would appeal to.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model is brightly&nbsp;coloured&nbsp;and would be perfectly suited to &quot;swooshing&quot; around the room.&nbsp;I imagine the playability being very good with this set and I am happy with the minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is not my all-time favourite set in my collection but I still really like it and I enjoyed the time spent building it. As with other sets, R2 is forced to sit sideways but that&#39;s alright. I would recommend this set because of it&#39;s price point and minifigures.</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-10-09T22:41:03.263Z","Best Jedi starfighter","<p>It&#39;s not the first Jedi starfighter I buy, but it&#39;s surely the best one. I enjoyed it more than I expected, and I think it&#39;s &quot;bigger inside&quot;, just to quote Doctor Who: it seems very small, but you can have a lot of fun with it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has small-medium dimensions, and the instructions are clear.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has several particular parts: cockpit, flaps, shooters, etc.. There aren&#39;t many pieces, but they are all researched and not so standard.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It contains only two minifigures: a late Clone Wars Anakin&nbsp;from &quot;Episode III&quot;, with his lightsaber, and R2-D2.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I built it in very few time. It wasn&#39;t ever boring, and it was pretty easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is high detailed and very well done although&nbsp;it dimensions. The shooters are hidden, while the real guns are represented very well, like every part of it. R2 has its slot, Anakin his cockpit. Nothing to say: it&#39;s very fine to see.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It was one of my best acquires, and it&#39;s surely the best Jedi starfighter. And comparing it to other &quot;Star Wars&quot; fighters, I&#39;ve to say that he can loose just against a pair of them, because it can be so awful although the dimensions. I&#39;d&nbsp;suggest it to everyone.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Very similar to original version</p>

<p>&ndash; Awful cockpit part</p>

<p>&ndash; Well built cannons</p>

<p>&ndash; It&rsquo;s surely worth the little price</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Cockpit opening mechanism is a bit disappointing</p>

"VaderFan2187","2016-10-27T08:56:02.43Z","My favorite Star Wars set at this price!","<p>After waiting for more than a year (yep, delayed gratification lol) I finally got this set! And boy was it worth the wait!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Normal sized box, one very-slightly-thicker-than-usual instruction manual.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>A fun build, nothing too amazing thanks to the mirror imaging of the wings, but some variations are used to cover up the astromech droid &quot;hole&quot; on the right wing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The most obvious one is the cockpit (thank God it&#39;s printed), but there are also 4 yellow flaps and two (one is a spare) 1x1 round tiles printed with the republic insignia. Black lightsaber hilts used for backup cannons are useful too, as you get TWO spares (one in bag 2, the other in bag 3). Yes, there are about ten stickers &gt;.&lt; but they are relatively easy to apply and add detail.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This set is very fun to play with. You can put Anakin and his lightsaber into the cockpit. The lightsaber hilt and blade are held by clips behind Anakin. Close the cockpit and swoosh this awesome ship around!! (I am a TFOL) Also, there are two spring loaded shooters with green missiles underneath which were new to 2014.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>At this price range I would have liked 1 more, maybe a buzz droid, but the two included are superb nonetheless. Anakin has a dual sided head, one stern and the other smiling. I prefer the stern look. His torso and legs are both well detailed despite the dark colors. R2-D2 is awesome and is the same as the Sandcrawler one, so no need to pay hundreds of dollars for his new figure!</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>At the price range, the final model is quite large. It is a good size for swooshing, not too small, yet not too heavy.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Get it. At this price, it&#39;s a set that performs solidly.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:32:55.203Z","The Jedi Interceptor Returns","<p><strong>Set #75038 Jedi Interceptor: </strong>How many times has LEGO given us this ship since 2005? I believe it&rsquo;s at least four or five times by now, though some of them may have been re-packs in collection packs and stuff. I haven&rsquo;t managed to get one until now and I&rsquo;m very impressed with this re-interpreted build based on the ship Anakin used at the beginning of Revenge of the Sith. It&rsquo;s a really solid 30$ set and here&rsquo;s why I enjoyed picking it up.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>First of all I really love the impression the box design causes inadvertently, with the image of Darth Vader in the top right hand corner of the box reaching out; it almost looks like Vader is reaching out to grasp the Interceptor. Perhaps the Sith Lord enjoys playing with LEGO as much as the rest of us do. It&rsquo;s a nice quirky aspect of the box design. The back also showcases the features quite nicely.</p>

<p>The instructions are great, they&rsquo;re broken up by the three numbered bags in this set and feature easy to follow step-by-step instructions for the build. Unfortunately there is only a set checklist on the back cover and no minifigure checklist, which some might find upsetting.</p>

<p>Sticker sheet alert; this set includes stickers for details and it could be damaged in the box due to the lack of proper protection. (No cardboard.)</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A lot of ordinary yellow and grey pieces in the set. You could find a use for the unique cockpit piece with printed details and the printed dish with the cockpit window on it. Also there are two missile launchers with the new pressure launching design. If you&rsquo;re a fan of these new weapon designs.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In 2013 30$ LEGO Star Wars sets featured three great minifigures. In 2014 LEGO kept the price point and ditched one of the minifigures. All of these are apparently new, however the fact that you&rsquo;re only getting two minifigures in each set is rather unfortunate. Especially this set, because you get&hellip; Surprise, surprise Anakin Skywalker and R2-D2.</p>

<p>Now the box says they are both New, however I&rsquo;m not 100% confident on that claim for R2 as I think we&rsquo;ve seen this print in another set. It&rsquo;s a very nice print with high details and the silver dome is a nice solid dark colour, I&rsquo;m beginning to wish we&rsquo;d get back printing on Astromechs though, after all their backs are just as detailed as their fronts, so why they don&rsquo;t print this detailing all the way around is a mystery.</p>

<p>Anakin Skywalker is definitely new, he has a nice double-sided torso, awesome leg detailing, a great new hair piece and a double-sided facial print with a determined expression and a smiling expression. The face printing includes the communication equipment for talking to other pilots, this is slightly unfortunate when he&rsquo;s not in the cockpit of his ship though because it stands out as a very odd thing to see on a Jedi&rsquo;s face when battle against the Sith. His Lightsaber isn&rsquo;t new, and I kind of wish he included a cloak, but still it&rsquo;s not too terrible.</p>

<p>The minifigure selection is slightly disappointing, it might have been nice to at least include a Buzz Droid to menace R2 with and have a bit more play potential in the set.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>As I said before this build works through three numbered bags; bag #1 is the central cockpit area of the ship, #2 is the right wing and #3 is the left wing and the top of the cockpit. Each section of the build is fairly quick, I&rsquo;d estimate between 25 and 30 minutes on each section tops before you&rsquo;re done.</p>

<p>The build is fairly satisfying&hellip; I can&rsquo;t say how much it differs from past iterations of this design, however I will caution you to pay close attention to how the stickers are placed on the wings. I was a bit too quick on the draw and accidentally misplaced the stickers due to making an assumption. So take it slow and do not put the stickers on both sides of the wings, that isn&rsquo;t how their meant to go and taking them back off again leaves disgusting sticky residue behind. Just a cautionary tale.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The completed model of this set is extremely impressive, I love Starfighter designs for the most part and this ship is a very fun little model. You can play with it quite easily because there is a good area for gripping in the rear, the missiles don&rsquo;t get in the way like flick-fire missiles sometimes do and the wings just look gorgeous and their functionality for attack and flight poses are really solid.</p>

<p>The cockpit is slightly disappointing though, because you have stickers instead of printed details for the controls, in fact the flight controls being a sticker is a bit unfortunate as part of the design. There are two clips in there for Anakin&rsquo;s saber hilt and blade for storage. It&rsquo;s a great little ship and I&rsquo;d buy it again if the re-released the red Obi-Wan version in the very near future.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend picking this set up if you haven&rsquo;t gotten one before. If you already own it in one of the earlier versions you may not find it to interesting as it does only come with some common minifigures. (R2 and Anakin are everywhere.) Printed details would have been a better choice honestly, but I won&rsquo;t hold it too against it because I love the design of this ship.</p>
