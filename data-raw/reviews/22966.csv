"lego_collector_123","2020-06-27T05:03:29.72Z","Slightly Flawed ","<p>The V-Wing starfighter is one of the lesser known Star Wars spaceships; seen mainly in &ldquo;Revenge of the Sith&rdquo;. While it&rsquo;s not one of my favourite models I still like the design &ldquo;in universe&rdquo;. The figures aren&rsquo;t particularly interesting but they are well detailed and appropriate to the set. This set plays well but I have a few concerns with the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>V-wing pilot: I don&rsquo;t think V-Wing pilots ever appear on screen in &ldquo;Revenge of the Sith&rdquo; but based on source material this figure looks very accurate. Both his helmet mould and print look fantastic. The front of the helmet is open and the helmet design continues onto the face. While this doesn&rsquo;t allow for a facial expression, the end result looks fantastic, so I don&rsquo;t mind. The torso is equally well detailed with breathing tubes and a flight suit. Unfortunately the legs are unprinted making him less detailed than other figures. He carries a blaster pistol.</p>

<p>Astromech droid: This is a Q series astromech droid although it&rsquo;s mislabeled as an R4 unit. The colour scheme of red and white is very striking. The silver print on the head is nice, and while lego astromech droids are notorious for having off-center head prints, in my case the print is fine. The torso looks great with printed red and silver grills, compartments, ports, etc. As is the case with all astromech droids, the back is sadly unprinted. He has standard legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This V-Wing starfighter model looks best in flight mode but, as a stand isn&#39;t included, it must be in a landing position for display. I think this is a major oversight. Both a flight stand could have easily been included, and the landing mode should have been redesigned to look more movie accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The starfighter looks great in flight mode. The front of the ship is tapered and has several large sticker details. Two spring-loaded shooters are nicely integrated into the body&nbsp;and they can be fired from the back of the set. The cockpit is spacious and fits the pilot easily. Another sticker details the control panel. My least favourite part of the ship is the raised section at the back. This is where the droid should sit but instead, only the head is mounted on a turntable. This was done because there isn&rsquo;t enough space for the whole droid. I think the whole set needed to be redesigned to fit the droid as it massively detracts from the set. The greenish yellow rear engines look very good. The wings look great in flight mode. They angle in perfectly and the laser cannons look nice. Sadly the cannons are easily broken off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In landing mode, the wings rotate upwards and the landing gear descends. This isn&rsquo;t particularly movie accurate, the wings should fold down so they touch the ground and the cannons should fold out of sight. While this would definitely be difficult to achieve in Lego, I think it is an essential feature as you can&rsquo;t display the set in flying mode. The set plays very well due to the spring-loaded shooters and is very swishable.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
There are two major problems with this set, the landing mode, and the droid. While it would be difficult to include these changes at minifig scale I wish the end result was nicer. $40 aud is about the average price for a set this size and I think it is reasonable. I would only recommend this set if you find it less than the rrp.&nbsp;<br />
