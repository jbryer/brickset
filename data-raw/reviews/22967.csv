Already from the images, I liked what I saw. A sturdier, far more detailed Wheel Bike than its predecessor in 7255, with both Grievous and Obi-Wan getting a fantastic update.</p><p>The set itself is priced at Â£19.99, which represents excellent value for money. Obi-Wan has been kept mostly the same since he last appeared in 9494, but now his dark tan legs have robe printing which go about half way down.&nbsp;For those of you who own 8095 and/or 9515, Grievous is made of the same component parts but has had a colour change from the tan in Clone Wars to a more movie-accurate White, with dark shadows underneath his eyes and a more sinister stare. This figure alone makes obtaining the set worthwhile, but the Wheel Bike has also undergone a drastic improvement since 2005. The old&nbsp;centre part in 7255&nbsp;with the two printed radar dishes with spikes has been upgraded to a trans-clear 'motorbike wheel' (seen in Homing Spider Droid in dark bluish grey), with a series of 12 2x4 mudguards with wings connected together with 1x2 clip plates, with alternating metallic grills on top, all wrapped around the outside rim of the wheel.</p><p>The driver's seat has also seen a considerable update, now also with&nbsp;a trans-dark pink 1x1 round tile specially printed with the computer pattern seen in the movie on the driver's right. On the far side of the wheel bike, the weapons section has been made considerably bulkier and more accurate, as well as Lego's inevitable 'flick-fire missile' included as one of the three laser cannons.</p><p>The legs, also, have undergone a drastic improvement. In 7255, they were 4 Bionicle arms with jackhammers attached to the ends to look like feet. These have now changed with two liftarms connected together, with a single pin holding the 2 pearl dark grey claws on the inside of the leg.&nbsp;There is also a&nbsp;series of pins holding the black tapered legs in place on the outside, which are decorated with brand new Sand Blue 'cheese wedges'.</p><p>&nbsp;So, to summarise:</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Grievous is a clear winner over the old one used in 2005, using the more modern design from the Clone Wars and recreating it into an excellent movie-accurate figure.</li><li>All parts of the Wheel Bike have received a considerable upgrade, the set itself is a reminder of how times have changed for the better&nbsp;in the 8 years since 7255.</li><li>New parts are included, the trans-clear motorbike wheel and the sand blue cheese wedges help to play a part in making this set look brilliant.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Absolutely none.</li></ul>
<p>Overall, this set is a true representation of fantastic value for money. Not only do we see some excellent building techniques and parts in comparison to its predecessor, but the figures have received a fantastic update to draw them away from Clone Wars and back in line with the movies. If you are considering buying this set, I highly urge you to do so. I can certainly see this set, like the old 7255, appreciating in value considerably over time.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Lucem","2014-05-18T00:24:46.393Z","Better Off with the 2005 Version","<p>Ah, Grievous&#39; wheelbike. The whole battle against Grievous and Obi-Wan was definitely one of the best scenes in Episode III, or rather, the whole prequel trilogy. This set represents the part in the fight where General Grievous hops into his wheelbike and he and Obi-Wan have a chase scene through the streets of Utapau. So, how well does this set represent that?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the hunk of cardboard that your set comes in so the pieces don&#39;t get damaged.</p>

<p>The instructions are what you use to put together the set.</p>

<p>Moving on.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are quite nice. You get a bunch of sand blue cheese slopes, a large clear techinic wheel, some metallic grills, and a lot of 1 x 2 clip pieces, just to name a few.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigs here are really nice. You get an Obi-Wan Kenobi, which is a nice update to the one previously seen in the 2010 Jedi Interceptor set. He has new leg printing and updated torso printing. You also get General Grievous, who uses the same mold as the Clone Wars version, but in a white color. Honestly, an off-white would&#39;ve been better than plain white, but hey, at least the color they used is more movie-accurate than tan.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Honestly, the build isn&#39;t that great. It&#39;s very repetitive.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I have mixed feelings about this. On the one hand, it&#39;s a nice set. It has good playability, and I&#39;m sure kids will love it. However, on the other hand, it&#39;s a bad set. Looking at it from an accuracy point of view, the 2005 wheelbike set is better.</p>

<p>Here are all of the inaccuracies in a list:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wheel should be two separate disks instead of one large wheel</li>
	<li>Wheelbike is too big and not in minifig scale</li>
	<li>Grievous&#39; Electrostaff is too long</li>
	<li>The whole back side of the model just isn&#39;t right</li>
	<li>No Boga!!!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you were to buy this set for a kid and they didn&#39;t care about accuracy, I&#39;m sure they would love this. However, if you are a collector and is all about accuracy, I would say that you should pass on this set and try to get your hands on the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7255-1/General-Grievous-Chase"">2005 version</a>.</p>

"wii1232","2014-08-17T22:09:01.483Z","Boring","<p>Set 75040 General Grievous&#39; Wheel Bike has its pros, but there are quite a few cons about this set. &nbsp;Most of the pros &amp; cons compare &amp; contrast to 2005&#39;s 7255 General Grievous Chase.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small, yet it shows everything a LEGO box is supposed to show. &nbsp;The instructions are 56 pages long. &nbsp;That&#39;s pretty decent considering&nbsp;its amount of pieces.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>261 pieces. &nbsp;That&#39;s 150 more pieces than General Grievous Chase, which had only 111 pieces. &nbsp;That&#39;s a good deal, considering LEGO.com&#39;s 10 cent per piece policy(estimate). &nbsp;Normally, that would make it cost $26.10, but they cut it back to $24.99. &nbsp;That&#39;s a GOOD deal.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I give LEGO a thumbs up for coming out with a new General Grievous. &nbsp;The all white General from 2005 had droid parts. &nbsp;That was a stump. &nbsp;But now, the pieces are molded to match the CW Grievous from 9515 Malevolence from 2012&nbsp;and 8095 General Grievous&#39; Starfighter from 2010, except NOW the tan areas have been replaced with white, and the eye design is smaller than the bulgy eyes he got in the Clone Wars sets. &nbsp;Obi-Wan, now, I have concerns about. &nbsp;He looks good with his dual-sided head and all, but the fact that&nbsp;he didn&#39;t come with a lightsaber&nbsp;sucks! &nbsp;Sure, he lost it during the dual with Grievous, and it fell down and Commander Cody caught it &amp; gave it back to him later. &nbsp;But they could&#39;ve given him his lightsaber just because he had it BEFORE he dropped it. &nbsp;After that, THEN he fought with Grievous over the electrostaff, and eventually killed Grievous by shooting him in the &nbsp;chest, setting his organs on fire. &nbsp;But he still could&#39;ve come with a lightsaber.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took up the length of 1 Chopped show(a show on Food Network), an hour. &nbsp;But, hey, it depends on how fast you can read the instructions, find the pieces, then put them together. &nbsp;All in all, it was fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is missing all but 1 thing: a BOGA! &nbsp;Obi-Wan needs his varactyl lizard to chase Grievous&#39; Wheel Bike, just like he did in General Grievous Chase! &nbsp;That was totally a fail. &nbsp;And the size is no different than the 7255 wheel bike.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion is that this is a good set. &nbsp;Not great, not excellent, but not poor. &nbsp;It&#39;s just okay. &nbsp;Unless LEGOs intent was to replicate the one scene in the movie where Grievous is rolling down that alleyway on his wheel bike, and Obi-Wan has just hopped off of Boga and is fighting him for the electrostaff, then the wheel bike falls off the cliff and the General gets out 2 lightsabers&nbsp;to finish Kenobi, which is when he gets shot, this was a flunk in my opinion. &nbsp;It gets 3 out of 5 stars, 2 for the new Grievous, and 1 for the price. &nbsp;Unless you buy Boga from eBay, and use a blue lightsaber from another set, this set is nothing but a wheel bike, Grievous and his opponent.</p>

"darth2701","2015-01-22T08:04:12.577Z","Redesigned Wheel-bike, better then the last one","<p>When I saw the Star Wars catalogue for 2014 and I saw this set, I wanted it immediately. I got it for my 13th birthday. This is my review about it (Sorry about my bad English)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a medium sized box, the instruction is 55 pages. There are 3 bags, #1 is for Obi-Wan and the wheel, #2 is for Grievous and the seat and guns, and #3 is for the legs.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There seems to be no new moulded-parts. But Grievous&#39;s and the 1x1 round tile representing the control&#39;s has new prints.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<h3>Obi-Wan Kenobi (EP 3)</h3>

<p>Obi-Wan hasn&#39;t changed most of his parts. His torso and legs seems to be a new printing. ( I don&#39;t know about this, so sorry if I&#39;m wrong). He is equipped with a standard blaster.</p>

<h3>General Grievous</h3>

<p>His printings is mostly the same as the Clone Wars version, except that they are white. His eyes are new, they look more evil. He has 2 green and 2 blue lightsabers, and a new electrostaff (it&#39;s too long in my opinion, compared to the Clone Wars version, but it&#39;s better than the last one).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<h3>The wheel</h3>

<p>The wheel is made from wheel-guards, clips-and-bars, and grilles. They connect to a Technic transparent motorcycle wheel-rim.</p>

<h3>The seat and guns</h3>

<p>Grievous can sit by placing his feet on a 1x2 clips plate. There is a control button connected with a vertical 1x1 clip to a plate-and-handles. The gun is made from bars with transparent orange 1x1 cones on their tips. There is a flick fire missile (At first I think it was a spring-loaded shooter). The seat and guns are connected with Technic pieces and some curved slopes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks AWESOME. Its a bit too high, the legs are too long. It has many playability, especially with the legs. The legs are very poseable The wheel can spin freely. The flick fire missile can fire quite far, although it needs a certain finger position.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The designers had redesigned this set far more better. Its really detailed and playable.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Small, well-sized, box that is on the thinner side for sets of this size. Instructions were easy to understand but I did have trouble putting the &quot;legs&quot; in the correct places so that they worked right. Not a flaw, just my own issue :)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I liked the pieces used on the wheelbike. They made this set look unique on a shelf filled with other sets that used more solid stud-style pieces. This almost gave me a Technic vibe.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Grievous was the main reason I bought this set and he did not disappoint. If I could change one thing, I would make his arms move in more directions &nbsp;because the lower arms only move up and down and the upper arms only go side to side. The printing on Obi-Wan is very crisp and clear. His hair piece looks just like the movie and I love it. The minifigures are very good.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very good set. I find it quite hard to steady and get it to stand even and not all tipped over to one side, but once you get it set then it looks great on your shelf. I, like others, would love to get Boga for Obi-Wan to ride, but oh well, I guess we don&#39;t get&nbsp;one this time.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:36:17.117Z","Highly Impressive Update to a 2005 set.","<p><strong>Set # 75040 General Grievous&rsquo; Wheel Bike: </strong>This past year has been rather interesting when it comes to the LEGO 25$-30$ price range, this set updates the Wheel Bike first seen in 2005&rsquo;s RotS line of LEGO sets. You don&rsquo;t get a Boga in this set unfortunately, however the main model is a great looking build and I feel makes an improvement to the previous set. (Which I never managed to get unfortunately.)</p>

<p>Read on and find out about the good, the bad and just pure awesome!</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: Again the similarities to Hasbro&rsquo;s box design can be both unfortunate and fun. It&rsquo;s fun because if you collect more than LEGO Star Wars and enjoy the action figure lines you can have an easy time knowing which year a set or figure was released from a given company. Unfortunate because the design is, after a while of seeing them on the shelf, bland and oh hey was that set new for the Summer? I can&rsquo;t remember, they all look the same.</p>

<p>I do find the designs good for the Theme, it&rsquo;s very Sith inspired with the dark colours. Also of note this set&rsquo;s box is a bit smaller than I expected for a set of this size. It&rsquo;s actually quite condensed with all the bags and the manual having very little space. This means that your manual could be crumpled, folded, or damaged in some way. Could be, not guaranteed to be as mine was actually perfectly packaged.</p>

<p>Manual: Speaking of which, surprisingly enough this manual design is pretty awesome. Yes it is just the same as the box, but for the manual you get a bit more of a dynamic image on the cover because it isn&rsquo;t cut off by any big writing or the minifigure box in one corner. New to this year, from what I can recall, we not only have a minifigure checklist in the back of the manual, but now LEGO has taken to including checklists of all the sets from a given wave. (Or most of them, exclusives are not visible here.)</p>

<p>The steps for the model are broken up surprisingly enough in 3 numbered bags. There&rsquo;s nothing really tricky in this build, just repetitive. The instructions make it pretty clear how everything goes and what you should build next. So they&rsquo;re pretty serviceable.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Not much to say about the parts here, the biggest element is the large clear wheel. I don&rsquo;t think there are really any rare parts in this set, which for the most part you&rsquo;ll find in a lot of Star Wars sets. Nothing too unique or rare, perfect parts packs for generic brick collecting though not cheap.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Two minifigures included in this set only, a magnaguard would have been nice, since that particular character hasn&rsquo;t been seen outside of Clone Wars sets, but considering the scene this is meant to emulate I can understand why they&rsquo;d only include the two they did.</p>

<p>Obi-Wan Kenobi: From Episode 3 and brand new according to the box, this minifigure has a nice double-sided torso print, leg printing showing off the Jedi robes and a double-sided facial print with serious and determined expressions. Plus his hair piece which I believe may be new, or at least the colour is new.</p>

<p>For accessories he only has a blaster and the electrostaff he stole from the absent Magnaguard. Since he lost his Lightsaber prior to the events of the set I understand why he doesn&rsquo;t have it, this makes him unique when he&rsquo;s on display with the rest of your jedi minifigures.</p>

<p>General Grievous: They say he&rsquo;s new, personally I think just the print on him is considered new since I think the pieces used to make him is the same as his Clone Wars animated looking counterpart from sets like the Malevolence. I love the update LEGO has done for Grievous, the newly sculpted parts here work so much better than the old Battle Droid style Grievous from when they first made him as a Minifigure.</p>

<p>They give him four lightsabers for accessories here, not accurate to the scene, as by this point Obi-Wan has &lsquo;disarmed&rsquo; him, however it wouldn&rsquo;t be very playable if you didn&rsquo;t include proper accessories. I do wish he had some kind of rotatable wrists though, it would help with many more action poses and would also fix the stability problems he has when he&rsquo;s holding all four weapons.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>This set is broken up into 3 numbered bags, an odd choice for such a small set, I mean the piece count isn&rsquo;t that high and the price point is one where you typically won&rsquo;t find numbered bags. That being said it does mean that the build is very fast, as each step is one section of the wheel bike.</p>

<p>Bag 1: The wheel itself, not much to say here, it&rsquo;s a very repetitive build for the sections surrounding the large wheel and it won&rsquo;t take more than five or six minutes to complete. Obi-Wan is also in this bag.</p>

<p>Bag 2: This one features the pilot&rsquo;s chair section and the cannon located on the other side. This is slightly more of a challenge from the first bag though not by much. And again I doubt it&rsquo;ll take very long, General Grievous is in this bag and the electrostaff accessory.</p>

<p>Bag 3: Again quite a bit of repetition here, which can&rsquo;t be helped since you&rsquo;re working on the four legs and the rear handle for holding the vehicle when it&rsquo;s in bike mode. Again nothing tricky here.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say the build is extremely satisfying, however I did enjoy it and like how they seem to have improved the design compared to the original.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>I love the nature of this finished model. It doesn&rsquo;t take up too much space on a shelf, has perfect stability when the legs are deployed and is super fun to turn into wheel mode and just run it around on any flat surface you can find. The uniform look of the model is also impressive, the colours work well together and even the technic pin push-fire missile play feature isn&rsquo;t too obtrusive.</p>

<p>For the price though I kind of wish they would have included the Boga creature again with more detailed printing, as it would have enhanced this set. Plus I know Jedi can do amazing things, but running after a vehicle traveling probably over 50 miles per hour isn&rsquo;t very feasible. Still this vehicle always intrigued me, and I like it here.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend this set. It&rsquo;s a great upgrade of the original Wheel Bike with some awesome new minifigures and fast build techniques. I bought this set at Costco which was cheaper than regular retail, I&rsquo;d suggest trying to get this set on sale as without the Boga I feel the set is slightly incomplete for the price point. And I do wish strongly that they would have continued giving us sets with three minifigures as they did in 2013 for this price point. Great fun set.</p>

"PjtorXmos","2023-01-18T17:24:09.757Z","Extremely good Value but somewhat tedious build","<p>TL;DR This is your set to get, if you really want the &quot;new&quot; General Grievous, even on the used market.</p>

<p><strong>The Figures</strong></p>

<p>The Minifig selection in this one is pretty good, because you can perfectly recreate the movie scene, this set is meant to recreate. I really like the addition of the electro staff, so you can really do anything, that happens in that scene.</p>

<p>Obi Wan&nbsp;looks very crisp, and the addition of printed legs is a very welcome one. General Grievous is a really cool and unique figure that a lot of people really want in their collection, however, it bugs me a little, that the whites of the legs and the printed parts don&#39;t match. It&#39;s a small thing, but lego could&#39;ve probably printed the white on in multiple&nbsp;layers to counteract this. General Grievous himself is quite fragile, so you really have to be careful to not break his arms (replacements don&#39;t come cheaply).&nbsp;This set&nbsp;is in my opinion the best way to pick up General Grievous for your collection by far to date.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Although the bike is a lot larger, than it actually should be (kinda not really achievable without using some seriously illegal techniques, and making more&nbsp;fragile), it&nbsp;is a huge improvement over the 2005 version. It has all the angular and aggressive lines of the original and is instantly recognisable as such. I really like the way, they built the actual wheel around the transparent Lego motorcycle wheel piece. That being said, the build is just plainly repetitive and therefore not really that enjoyable, although rolling the wheel segments onto the transparent wheel is pretty satisfying. The whole build sadly&nbsp;is also&nbsp;a bit fragile in some places. It is very easy to knock off one of the side panels of the legs or break the wheel, because one of the segments didn&#39;t stay in place. Not really&nbsp;a problem for me, but a kid wanting to actually play with this, might find that rather annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The value on the used market</strong></p>

<p>(! Disclaimer: I&#39;ve rated the set based on its retail price in Germany, but this section is about specifically about the used market at the day of writing this!)</p>

<p>So this definitely still is the best way to pick up a General Grievous figure, if you need one. You can get the whole set with all Minifigs on your preferred&nbsp;&quot;used items sales site&quot; at about the price, you would pay for a used General Grievous figure on Bricklink. This set still is a great value option and is an absolute no-brainer in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

The bike does not have place for the lightsabers but I&#39;ll give that a pass because the bike has so much going on for it anyway. And it has a blaster holder.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t like that the Grievous figure is white. Would have preferred it to be a bit more regular droid-color. Also would&#39;ve been great if Obi-Wan had his lightsaber. But that&#39;s fine because at least Obi-Wan gets a blaster and a staff-weapon.</p>

<p>All in all - would definitely recommend. Cool figures and even cooler vehicle. I usually value the minifigures more than the build but in this case I gotta give the Wheel Bike some serious praise. Value set. Get it.</p>
