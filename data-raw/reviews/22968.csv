<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>box art is quite good, (although you wonder where that other laser came from!) planet behind seems to be Mustafar which would fit the Nemodian guard well, however it does not fit the vulture droid, as a better planet for that would be Corousant in order to fit into the movie</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>nothing particularly useful, except the new spring loaded missile, which is a nice feature</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Nemodian guard; good quality and great detail on the body, i like the use of a cavilers hat for his helmet, as it suits the character well. the face is quite good for making other basic aliens from other themes other than star wars</li>
	<li>battle droid pilot; basic battle droid with new printing, nothing particularly intresting, however it&#39;s always a useful addition</li>
	<li>buzz droid; built in a similar fashion to the last buzz droid, but with a new connecting piece which resembles a gun and zip wire piece instead of a saw</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>very quick and easy, except stickers</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>not very movie accurate, what with there being a cockpit and the lack of ability to move the head around, however despite the loss of head movement it appears stronger than the last vulture droid, (seen in the Asoka Tano Jedi star fighter set?) and is a good addition for creating any clone wars styled battles</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>good mini-figs and nice looking model, however not very movie accurate and quick to build</p>

"Tar_Domo","2014-08-31T10:45:25.1Z","Vulture Droid With The New Buzz Droid","<p>I have already a vulture droid from Ahsokas Starfighter set and the main reason I bought this was the new Buzz droid. Other minifigures were interesting ones, too.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions </strong>The box is about same size than other sets with the same price. Instructions were easy to follow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts </strong>The main reason I gave this set 5 stars from parts is the great Buzz Droid with nice parts though some of it&acute;s pieces are standard but combined in a new way. The Vulture Droid also has some exclusive parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures </strong>This set has great minifigures. It could come with an extra Rocket Battle Droid but it&acute;s not a must. It comes with three minifigures: a Battle Droid Pilot, a Buzz Droid and a Neimoidian warrior.</p>

<p>The battle droid pilot is the same as in the Microfighter AAT. It is nice but after being in a few sets it&acute;s not exclusive anymore.</p>

<p>Neimoidian warrior is a new character and I think it won&acute;t appear in a lot of sets so if you want it you maybe should buy this set. It&acute;s a great add to my minifigure collection and has nice printings.</p>

<p>The Buzz droid is the star of the set. It comes also with the Droid Tri-Fighter but that is a little pricey set compared to this so I recommend you to buy this set if you want the Buzz droid. This new version of the&nbsp;it is cool and better than the earlier versions in my opinion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The build </strong>This was an easy one to build. It has many stickers, though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model </strong>The Vulture Droid is nice new version and bigger than the one in Ahsokas Starfighter set. You can put it to flying or standing mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion </strong>This is a 4-star set in my opinion. I recommend it for the minifigures. Also if you don&acute;t have a Vulture Droid before this is a good set for you.</p>

"AlkkuV","2022-02-02T17:39:02.97Z","Looking for a remake.","<p>Hello guys, it&#39;s AlkkuV, back with another review. Sorry for not making reviews for a couple of days, but i&#39;ve been busy with building my old City sets. But without further ado, let&#39;s get into the review. Today&#39;s review is set number: 75041 Vulture Droid. This set was released in January 2014 and retired December 2014.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: The box art was nothing special, just a basic space background, with some explosions and blaster bolts. The instructions were clear and had 53 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures. This set comes with three minifigures, and one of them is unique to this set. The minifigures are: Battle Droid Pilot with Blue Torso with Tan Insignia and One Straight Arm, which appears in six sets, Buzz Droid with Zipline Handle, which appears in two sets, and Neimodian Warrior, who is unique to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: This set comes with 205 pieces. All the Earth Blue and Sand Blue pieces are very useful, and there is a couple of New Dark Red pieces. All of these pieces are very useful for MOCs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The set comes with two numbered bags, the first one had the droids, and the base of the fighter, the second one has the Neimodian, and the wings of the ship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall this set is a very good set for a 7-year-old. It&#39;s nice and easy to build and the minifigures are okay. The playability is not that good because there are no good guys. The value for money is okay, I don&#39;t really&nbsp;know, the price range was $20 to $25 when it got released, but nowadays, the price for sealed versions has risen to almost $70. Overall I would give this set a 4.7/5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and stay toon for more reviews.</p>
