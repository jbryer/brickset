If you were thinking of buying it, I would hold off until it is on sale. The pictures are taken in such a way that the ship looks bigger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A: I do not own this set.</p>

<p>B: I will still get this set, because I like the parts and the minfigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of cool parts and it looks great.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two minifigures look great, and there are 2 standard droids.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is one of those sets that will disappoint like Attack on Weathertop&nbsp;9472, because despite it being cool, the size of it and the piece count are lacking. I like the design and will get it, but I will wait until it is on sale.</p>

<p>This set is technically not mine,&nbsp;although I contributed to&nbsp;its purchase (a gift to a younger brother). It didn&#39;t&nbsp;look like much for&nbsp;$50 at first, but the finished result exceeded my expectations.</p>

<p>On to the review:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>At first sight, the box is somewhat disappointing. $50 may be pretty standard for a Lego set, but the box&#39;s proportions lead me to believe the set was probably not worth what was paid for it. It was probably closer to the&nbsp;standard box size for a $40 set and showed an unfortunate lack of depth (very thin). The art on the front of the it depicts a battle scene over the home world of the Wookies.&nbsp;The set&#39;s four minifigures are&nbsp;displayed in the bottom right corner, and an ad for the new spring-loaded shooters in&nbsp;the same place on the left. The rear art showcases the gunship&#39;s functions, most&nbsp;notably the bomb-dropping feature. The far right side of the box is dedicated to two&nbsp;images of the set&nbsp;at different angles. Above&nbsp;those is a picture of a small battle involving the gunship&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&#39;s allies (a Battle Droid and a Super Battle Droid) and their&nbsp;opponents (Chewbacca and a Clone Trooper).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instructions struck me as small for a set in this price range.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As far as I could tell, the parts were pretty standard (albeit useful), with the exception of a few more unique pieces,&nbsp;which included a&nbsp;flat tile with studs on the bottom.&nbsp;Tiles were very common.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;a useful, wide variety of parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I suppose for $50 they <em>could </em>have included more...</p>

<p>Aside from that, the minifigures included are&nbsp;decent, although I was not particularly impressed by the selection.</p>

<p><strong>Chewbacca</strong>: A more detailed version of the original type of Chewbacca, he comes with printed legs and his ever-present crossbow in an interesting gunmetal gray.</p>

<p><strong>41st Elite Corps Trooper</strong>: Wielding a standard&nbsp;Star Wars firearm, this minifigure comes with a detailed torso&nbsp;printed with great looking camouflage. His helmet, though&nbsp;including the same excellent&nbsp;camo,&nbsp;seemed too tall and awkward looking for my approval.&nbsp;The legs also look a bit&nbsp;out of tune with the camo on the&nbsp;torso and helmet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Battle Droid and Super Battle Droid</strong>:&nbsp;As far as I can tell,&nbsp;both of these minifigures are useful, but have retained the same&nbsp;designs they have had since they were first&nbsp;inserted into a set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I actually didn&#39;t build this model, but&nbsp;I studied the instructions&nbsp;to be able to&nbsp;write about this section. The build is interesting, focusing primarily around the bomb-dropping function. The head of the gunship is built very cleverly; it allows the battle droid to&nbsp;fit inside while remaining remarkably realistic and detailed.&nbsp;And of course, as can be seen in the next section, the end result is very rewarding.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When I first saw the completed (or possibly close to completed) model, I was surprised at its size. I had expected the gunship to be on the mediocre side, but I was taken aback at its proportions.&nbsp;While not huge, the&nbsp;set is certainly not undersized, and&nbsp;had a very nice weight for 439 pieces.&nbsp;The bomb-dropping feature works well; the loading and releasing process is&nbsp;very polished (it includes&nbsp;a locking&nbsp;function that&nbsp;prevents accidental bombing runs). The range of the&nbsp;spring loaded shooters was far superior to the&nbsp;massive old&nbsp;spring loaded cannons (such as in the Imperial Landing Craft and the 2007 Naboo Starfighter).</p>

<p>Overall, the completed model was excellent and very well designed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Though slightly overpriced, I would recommend this superb model to anyone in need of any additions to their CIS army. It&#39;s a very well-rounded set, and certainly exceeded my expectations.</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-10-10T06:27:58.82Z","Funny Separatist ship","<p>The Droid Gunship is a whole missile launcher platform, and I love it for this trait. The Lego version is identical to the original one, from &quot;Episode III&quot; and &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, and all the weapons are reproduced correctly, so I found it a good set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is maybe too big for the final result; however, it displays the many features of it. The instructions were clear, and I didn&#39;t have problems at all.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Gunship has strange parts, like the ones used at the sides of the frontal turret and at the sides of the &quot;head&quot;. It also got new model turrets, like the ones in AT-DP, who can rotate completely. It has many gray rounded pieces, that appear&nbsp;in the hull.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures include two battle droids: a normal one (B1) and a super one (B2), not different from the other Separatist sets. We find a member of 91st&nbsp;Elite Corps, the unit of Commander Gree, with swamp armor and helmet, that also features a green visor. Chewbacca&nbsp;is a new minifigure, if I&#39;m not wrong, but he isn&#39;t very different from older sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building experience wasn&#39;t bad, but however the hull was a bit boring. On the other hand I enjoyed building the cockpit, that is very well done.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Gunship appear as it is in the film and in the TV series: lethal and powerful. The only think I&#39;m disappointed at is the fact that Lego preferred to use bombs instead of missiles below the platform: in &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; we see it shooting a lot of rockets, so at least they could use missiles to be more loyal to the original one. But the cockpit is very faschinating, it&#39;s so well done, high detailed and all playable.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a good set, that doesn&#39;t cost too much and that can give you a really nice playing experience. I don&#39;t usually like Separatist sets because in &quot;Star Wars&quot; media they are destroyed very fast&nbsp;and deployed in great number, so they don&#39;t excite me. But this set is a true gunship, and in my opinion is one of the best in CIS Army.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Lovely &ldquo;head&rdquo;, identical to original version</p>

<p>&ndash; Worth the price</p>

<p>&ndash; Good minifigures, especially the Swamp Trooper</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Too few missiles</p>

<p>&ndash; No need for droid escape speeder</p>
