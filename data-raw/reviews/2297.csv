"legolander","2007-04-30T04:35:07.28Z","My very first  LEGO Harry Potter set...","This is actually my very first Harry Potter set. I received it as a birthday present. Ever since then, I always receive Harry Potter sets whenever it's my birthday. That's how I got most of these sets. Anyway, moving on with my review, this is one of the sets in which you can find a good amount of accessories. It has a cauldron, a yellow cup, a yellow mug, a spell book, a toad, a spider, a white scroll of parchment with magical words, a magnifying glass, 2 keys, and some potions. I think those things make the over-all appearance of the set look so good; not to mention the minifigs included. I give this set 4 stars!

"mngoult","2010-01-06T07:08:23.327Z","More Cobwebs but Its still good","This Harry Potter set offers good potential for expansion as it can sit two extra sets on top of it, this feature often limits the early Harry Potter sets but does make for impressive castles when you combine half a dozen or more sets.

Good minifigs in this one, nice to get some one else apart from Harry and Peeves is a nice addition. The class is well built and is hinged but the main thing which makes this a four star set is the volume of cool extra features.

Such as, the cauldron (with hidden section underneath), the magnifying class, hinged fireplace, door which opens, little frog (random but good), laddle, book with its own stand and lots of jars of potions. 

Pros
All the small additions listed above.
Three minifigs (good for a small set).
Required set for building expansions.

Cons
Another silly spider and cobweb (please no more).
Little too mish mashed with the colours.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The classroom is neat, but I think the parts that it come with really make this set cool. it has a cauldron and ladle. There's some random tablet, potions and a potion cabinet.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-27T10:53:08.633Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Snape's Class Review","This set is the cheapest way to get the LEGO Harry Potter ghost minifigure Peeves. You can hide him behind the rack which has some cool markings. There're no stickers included in this set which makes this piece more valuable. The other minifigs we get are Ron Weasley and Severus Snape. For some reason LEGO gave Snape a head which glows in the dark but he looks still cool.<br><br>The building itself is very sturdy and there's also a fireplace which has a big black boiler with a big yellow spoon. On the back of the building you can see a lever which you can use to make an explosion feature for the boiler. We also get a door which can be opened and a desk where you can hide a frog. This is a really great set and I don't have anything to complain about it.<br><br>All

This is a set with some exclusive and rare parts, such as the blue-clear magnifying glass and Snape's red potion book. I also liked how the classroom was set up, with the cauldron on the far left side and the door and ingredients on the right side. The cauldron was also another good part of the classroom, as it slid out and could be taken out. Overall, this set gets a 5/5.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-07T12:32:20.5Z","Peeves for a Great Price","<p>Set #4705 Snape's Class: This set is one of the better offings from Year One HP mainly because it doesn't have Harry Potter as one of the Mini-Figures and because of the items that ARE included with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snape's Class is built the same standard way as most of the other boxed sets from the first year LEGO introduced us to Harry Potter. With thicker base plates and no true walls. The 'walls' are mostly open colomns set up either side of the passageways between one room and the next. This set and The Room with the Winged Keys included hinged pieces to have one section swung out from the main classroom piece of the model. This set was actually intended to merge with TRwtWK, this was the bottom and TRwtWK was the top. Then you'd put Hogwart's Castle on top of both of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is a good source for some truly wonderful pieces. There's a Frog, the large LEGO cauldron, a yellow ladle for stirring up your potions, a rat, a scroll plate from the Castle Theme introduced during the Dragon Knights era, a red Magic Potions book, a transparent green spider with spider web, yellow goblet and yellow mug plus two grey keys for locking the door. It also featured that nifty looking roof piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mini-Figures included Ron Weasley, Professor Snape complete with Glow in the Dark head and Peeves the Poltergeist. (The cheaper alternative to paying for Hogwarts Castle to pick up this particular Mini-Figure.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set's big draw I think is the mini-figures, some might not appreciate the Harry Potter sets early builds due to the open aired look of the sets, but they do have their uses. Overall I'd have to say this is one of the must have sets from that era, the Mini-Figures are a great plus to an already interesting set and you gotta love the LEGO Frog piece. It also included a few accessories and let's not forget this set featured a Magnifying Glass.&nbsp; I'd have to say about the only bad thing about Harry Potter when it first came out was that it replaced the long standing Castle Theme as the Fantasy Theme LEGO produced and sold. At least I'm pretty sure it replaced it for a little while there, because it was a year or two before I saw Castle sets on the shelf again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reccommend Snape's Class to all collectors of Harry Potter. The pieces are perfect for MOCing and they will enhance your Hogwarts Castle when combined with those sets.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4

"xboxtravis7992","2016-10-28T03:21:36.7Z","A Throwback to my Childhood","<p>Although it has been over 15 years since this set has been released, I still remember when I first got it back in 2001; on Christmas Eve at a party at my grandparents house. It remained built for several years, ultimately falling into disrepair in the parts bin. A few years ago I rebuilt it again, and now have it on display in my Lego Collection underneath the original Hogwarts Castle. How has this set aged over the years? Lets find out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>This set comes with three minifigures. The design style of the figures has aged dramatically over the years; and sadly the three minifigures pale in comparison to the lastest versions released in conjunction with the last wave of Harry Potter sets. However, for their time these figures were adequate representations of the source material.</p>

<p><em>Ron Weasley</em></p>

<p>Of the three figures in this set, this one has aged the best. Sure his face is rather goofy, and his hair a bit off; but for a representation of a young Rupert Grint as he appeared in the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone (or Philospher&#39;s Stone as it is more properly known); it is pretty decent. While the later Ron figures captured the teenage look of the character better, this figure has enough of a goofy childish look to be a first year Hogwarts student.</p>

<p><em>Peeves&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>For a character that was never shown in the films, Peeves did make it into a few of these early sets. I am not a fan of this figure. The gray body is rather drap; and the printing is very minimal. If anything I feel this figure deserved to have had glow in the dark parts; which is weird to say because another figure in this set does indeed have glow in the dark parts...</p>

<p><em>Snape</em></p>

<p>The glow in the dark head on Snape these first few waves of Harry Potter sets has become almost memetic in the Lego fan community for the bizarre designs at the beginning of the 21st century. &nbsp;If anything though, it probably suggests that the Lego designers saw Snape as &quot;the villain&quot; of the set; something Alan Rickman&#39;s sour portrayal of the character in the films lead many people to believe. Of course by the series end we would know that Snape was anything&nbsp;<em>but&nbsp;</em>a villain (<em>&quot;always&quot;</em>); but this strange &quot;evil head&quot; Snape is an artifact of an earlier time.</p>

<p>Other than the bizzare&nbsp;head though, this figure was pretty well done. The face print does look like a scowling Alan Rickman a bit; and the torso print is rather well done to.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Lego in the early 2000&#39;s was suffering an era of &quot;Juniorization&quot; with simply built sets. And this set is evidence for that. Most of the walls are made up of six brick high &quot;beams&quot; with a pre molded door frame, a large pre molded roof, and large slope pieces. There are very few normal height bricks and plates. There are also gaps in the walls, suggesting more of a &#39;frame&#39; for a building, instead of a finished build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, this frame helps create an optical illusion that this set is much bigger than it actually is... Compare this set to a modern $20 set, and this one feels a lot more spacious. Not saying that is an excuse for the lackluster build, but it is a redeemable quality.</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Set</strong></p>

<p>When finished, this set is basically two boxes, connected by a hinge that recreate a scene. It doesn&#39;t look like a &quot;class&quot; but it has the look of a potions lab atleast. The cabinet on the wall can be hinged open to act either as a secret passage, or to hide Peeves so he can surprise unsuspecting students. The desk in the middle of the room can also be hinged open, to hide books underneath it. Many of the parts are from the castle sets of the late 1990&#39;s; such as the goblets, the cauldron, and many of the printed pieces. The cauldron rests on a platform which slides, but it doesn&#39;t have a lot of clutch so the cauldron falls off easily at the slightest movement.</p>

<p>As a stand alone set, this is rather disappointingly basic. However the genius of the Harry Potter sets made to match the first three films, was their modular connections. This set is designed to slot underneath the first Hogwarts Castle set as a &quot;dungeon&quot; addition. In this regard, it is very effective. As I mentioned earlier, my copy of this set is currently on display in this manner. The shadows of the building above help to fill in the negative space in the potions class set, and help it to feel more complete. The gappy build also leaves enough height, that even an adult can easily get their hands into the model, even when the other building is sitting on top of it.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this isn&#39;t a spectacular set; and it&#39;s juniorized build represents the problems plaguing Lego in this era. However, the set has a unique charm (helped by its source material) and the awesome ability to easily be combined with other Harry Potter sets from the era. I don&#39;t recommend it for those looking to capture Snape&#39;s&nbsp;Potion Class in Lego (they would be better making a MOC); but the charm of the set helps to compensate for many of its flaws.</p>

"HarryPotterLegoCollector","2020-10-06T09:52:20.043Z","Some good figures and lots of little extras that make the set","<p>There isn&#39;t much I don&#39;t like about this set, my main issue is I don&#39;t understand how the figure of Ron fits in when he&#39;s on his own, if he was with harry it would make a bit more sense. That being said there are some parts of this set which I think are well-thought-out.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-The cauldron can be tipped over</p>

<p>-Theres a peeves the poltergeist figure (never seen in films which I was gutted about) and the figure can hide behind a cupboard&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The glow in the dark snape figure</p>

<p>-There&#39;s lots of details like frog, cup and ladle in the cauldron&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>This was a bit harder to find faults as I say above the set could have benefited Harry being in it and the play could have been them getting into trouble together with peeves and snape coming to investigate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only other con would be I would have liked the cupboard to be enclosed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this set is well worth the money and nicely thought out&nbsp;</p>
