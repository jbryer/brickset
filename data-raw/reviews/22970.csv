"Chilly","2014-01-08T10:20:38.807Z","Finally,","<p>I was looking through the Argos website and I noticed the LEGO walker set, but sadly it was not available for delivery or pick up (at least where I was), so when I saw the ""leaked"" set images I was really excited. Let's not wait any longer and review the set itself.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>Box: The new LEGO star wars box looks great with the Darth Vader on it. I noticed a emphasis on the ""NEW SPRING-LOADED SHOOTER"" which I think is LEGO is probably overrating.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Instructions: There's not much to say about the instructions apart from it does show you some of the winter sets and minifigures.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The sets come with a few olive green pieces which with some of the Chima crocodile sets you could something in the colour, but it might be a weird shape because of how weird some of the pieces are. It come with a good amount of technic pieces. Apart from that there's a lot of round pieces which could prove useful.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Commander Gree: Starting of with the best figure in the set in my opinion, Commander Gree is wearing camouflage which looks very nice, his helmet is the new 2014 clone trooper mold, he has a blaster and a set of binoculars.</div><div><br></div><div>Chief Tarfful: Tarfful has the new wookie redesign for 2014 which is darker but has a lighter brown added in aswell, he has wookie armour printed on and even going over the shoulders, the minifigure also has some sort of gun.</div><div><br></div><div>Battle droid commander: This is like your ordinary battle droid, you've probably seen one, but be has a dot on his torso and a yellow marking on it's head, that's it.</div><div><br></div><div>Battle droid: Not much to say except it's like the commander only without the yellow markings.</div><div><br></div><div>Super battle droid: This figure, Still not as common as the battle droid, is quite common so I'm not going to say much about it, actually I'm going to say nothing about it.</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>It's quite a good Chang from most star wars sets, instead of the normal LEGO bricks with a few technic thrown in it's more technicy (if that's a word, wait, technic isn't even a word) than other star wars sets.</div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>To start of, I love the shape of the finished model. The new shooter fires quite well, but the shooter would have been better if you didn't have to push the ammo down to shoot. The top open up to reveal a cockpit for piloting the vehicle which has two seats. The third leg which makes the vehicle unable to walk for using the cannon, but so when you are walking you don't move the cannon there's a clip at the back which stops the cannon moving.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I think this brilliant for any star wars fan (Apart from the prequel haters) the only thing I don't like about is that when you open the cockpit it usually falls over.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4

"wii1232","2014-06-11T21:31:29.9Z","Minor Issues","<p>The All Terrain-Attack Pod had only a few issues, but I&#39;ll clear that all up later in the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was a good size, and the instructions were 2 booklets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It looks exactly how it does in Episode III during its brief showing in the Battle of Kashyyyk, fighting alongside the ground troops and HAVw A6&nbsp;Juggernauts(Clone Turbo Tanks).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There should be 2 more minifigures in this set. &nbsp;2 green Clone Troopers would have made this set the best it can be, because Clone Commander Gree cannot drive the thing, AND gun down the droids that are surrounding him. &nbsp;Chief Tarfful can&#39;t defend him, only his homeworld. &nbsp;Droids are too dumb to drive or gun from any Republic walker, and Chief Tarfful can&#39;t do it when he&#39;s fighting on the ground with his tribe of Wookiees. &nbsp;So unless you purchase set 75035 Kashyyyk Troopers, there will either be a driver with no co-driver(since there are 2 seats in the cockpit) nor gunner, or a gunner with no driver nor co-driver.</p>

<p>Aside from that, Chief Tarfful&nbsp;is very detailed, and Clone Commander Gree is VERY detailed with his blaster and electrobinoculars and all. &nbsp;Plus, it&#39;s easy to get the torsos mixed up between the battle droid and battle droid commander, so you have to look REALLY close at the front of both torsos(center body sections), and the Commander&#39;s torso has a tiny yellow dot in the middle. &nbsp;The regular Battle Droid doesn&#39;t.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took about 2 hours at most. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great, and can be used great for pose-play, but the legs are not easily adjustable. &nbsp;If you&#39;re not careful enough, a piece of one of the legs might come off. &nbsp;Plus the third retractable leg at the front doesn&#39;t&nbsp;stay retracted or up for long. &nbsp;If you move it or simply pick it up with the leg retracted, it will just slowly droop back down.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion of this set is that this is a great set. &nbsp;Not excellent, but great. (Scale is from worst to best: poor, fair, good, great, excellent(1 star, 2 stars, 3 stars, 4 stars, 5 stars.)) Still, $59.99 rounds up to $60.00, which is a good deal, considering LEGO.com has a 10 cent per piece policy. &nbsp;717 pcs x 10c = 7170 which would mean $71.70. &nbsp;It&#39;s an excellent deal!</p>

"LogJam","2014-06-21T16:40:01.013Z","A nice piece of Republic Military tech.","<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>The box is colourful&nbsp;and&nbsp;nice and glossy.&nbsp;The instructions are easy to read and enable you to build the walker to its completion. 9/10.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Quite a lot of parts, 700+, with a good parts to cost ratio. There is quite a lot of technic parts included. Overall some great and varied pieces which work well to represent the vehicle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Included is Commander Gree, Tarfful, a super battle droid, a battle droid, and a battle droid commander. The best minifigure is Gree, and Tarfful has nice detailing. However I would have preferred Gree and two other clones instead of Tarfful and the droids, as it would make more sense in this set. As it stands you only have one or two minifigs you can use inside the vehicle. I actually just put the droids back in the box so I didn&#39;t lose them. I also purchased a Kashyyyk troop pack and used the figures from that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not too difficult or confusing. It is a bit tedious to build the legs but they are worth it in the end. I also wish it didn&#39;t have the launching missile on top as I&#39;m not a big fan of those, but I just leave the projectile out and it looks fine.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once you are finished the walker looks very impressive. It stands proud with a height about 5cm more than a DVD case. It looks cool with the third leg either up or down. The leg folds up nicely and can be secured with a latch when not in use. One thing to note is that the two rear legs can&#39;t be moved except for at the very tops where they connect to the walker, and even then you can only move them backwards which means it can&#39;t stand up. So in effect the walker has only one &#39;pose&#39; in terms of the legs. Another thing is that there is quite a bit of space behind the crew cabin (at the rear of the vehicle) and a gap so you can see inside. I used some parts from the Kashyyyk&nbsp;troop set speeder vehicle to add some volume and cover the back of it and it turned out quite well. I also used some parts to add more detail to the top cannon and some sensor equipment in the front. The final modification I did was to use the seats from the Kashyyyk swamp speeder inside the crew cabin of this walker so that it could serve as a bit of a troop transport (I have 4 clones inside the cabin of the walker now). I may update this review with some pictures in time.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This model is great as a display set, and also has some nice play features if you are that way inclined. The cannons can move around and the top can be opened up to reveal the command cabin. There are also doors on the sides that swing open for access. This walker is very meaty and deceptively bigger than one might think, and is overall a good build experience and value for money. The only problems would be a bit of a sparse rear end to the main body of the vehicle, and some fairly impractical minifigs. However don&#39;t let these deter you from buying this killer set.</p>
