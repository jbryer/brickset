"Tar_Domo","2014-09-09T13:24:00.497Z","Finally A Cannon For Clones","<p>LEGO released a few years ago the cannon for separatist armies (set name Battle For Geonosis) and now in 2014 was the time to introduce the version for clones.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This came in a medium size box. The instructions were in a 70-paged manual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This has a few interesting parts. The red rope thingies are cool and you get one extra that you can use in your MOCs or if you success to break one of those in the cannon you are able to use the extra one. Very interesting exclusive pieces, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Other parts that deserve to be mentioned are the round, quite large grey things used in the cannon.</p>

<p>This has also a few Technic parts and the spring-loaded shooter.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This comes with three normal size minifigures and a droideka.</p>

<p>Plo Koon - The box says &quot;NEW&quot; and it&acute;s true. This Plo Koon has a lot harder headpiece than the soft one in Plo Koon&acute;s Jedi Starfighter. I prefer the earlier one but this is still a nice one specially if you don&acute;t have Plo from an earlier set.</p>

<p>Wolf Pack Clone Troopers - You get two wolf pack troopers. They are kind of exclusive and it&acute;s nice to get two instead of one. I don&acute;t get the sets that have one exclusive clone trooper that is hard to add in your army. Anyway, these are a new version of the one in Republic Frigate but these ones don&acute;t have a jetpack. They do have a new helmet design, though.</p>

<p>Droideka - The same droideka was in the Clone Troopers vs. Droidekas battle pack and is not a new thing. It&acute;s still a nice add specially for army builders. And of course it&acute;s an enemy that is needed in this kind of set. How could you play with the cannon without enemies? Well, of course you can choose that Plo Koon falls to the dark side but still...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building was nice and quite fast. I think it took me about 1h 30 minutes but I&acute;m not sure &acute;cause I built it in two days.</p>

<p>This comes with three bags and in number one you have to do the legs so you must build same thing twice. I built them at the same time &acute;cause I feel it&acute;s faster and doesn&acute;t feel so repetitive.</p>

<p>I had some little problem with the cannon but anyway it was quite easy and nice building experience.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is quite big. The best thing is that you can put the legs of the cannon that way that you can roll the whole thingie into a battle and the troopers and Plo Koon can stand on it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This a nice set to have.&nbsp;I bought it in sale and it was just about 45 euros. I recommend to get it specially if you found it in sale.</p>

"BrickofFate","2020-01-14T07:02:52.39Z","A long delayed one","<p>The av-7 appeared a long time ago,in the Clone wars movie from 2008.The Lego took their time and after about 6 years they released a lego representing this vehicle.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The box:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The box is middle-sized,with rectangular shape and it is very thick.It has the 2014 Darth Vader art which looks great with the background that is from Christophsis.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The instructions:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;They are middle-sized.As i can remember the av-7 set was not shown at the last page of any star star set instructions from 2014.That is because this set was relativively hard to find.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The build:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Building this set was very satisfying and was similar to the experience from building the droid cannon from the battle for Geonosis set. It is a great replica of the cannon from the clone wars altough it is more colourful.The build uses a combination of dark and light red,dark and light grey and yellow pieces which look great.The set looks better than&nbsp; in the pictures and on the box</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The minifigures:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are three of them and a droideka.Plo Koon is a new version with accurate printing on his torso and head.He is a fine addition to my collection(of jedi) :)The two wolf pack clonetroopers have the phase II armour and are the same although i found a misprint of some sort.The visor print is different as&nbsp; one of the clones&#39;s print does not connect with the chin as the other helmet.I found that this is the same for all of those clonetroopers.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Conclusion:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Even after 5 years it is an amazing set.I bought it from retail 5 years after its release for a great price.I definitely recommend this set fo the great minifigures and vehicle.</p>
