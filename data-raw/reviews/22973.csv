"Toby833","2014-08-06T08:50:44.98Z","Great Set, but Missed Opportunity for Ventress & Barriss Figures","<p>Being a big fan of the Clone Wars (and sad to see it go!), I knew from the announcement of this set that it was one I had to own. I got it from the LEGO Store, avoiding the Toys R&#39; Us markup, and I&#39;m&nbsp;pretty happy with it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Action-packed front and back, typical of Star Wars sets, that shows the functions of the Gunship and small top-down/front views. It&#39;s the same size box as many of the 2013-2014 sets that share the ~$50 price tag. The instruction booklet&nbsp;came folded inside, though not creased,&nbsp;and I easily flattened it by gradual gentle&nbsp;folding against my table.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This model nearly fits the golden price/part ratio, coming in at 481 pieces. A lot of nice dark blue and unique translucent red pieces are included. The model&nbsp;comes with the new spring shooter bricks with translucent blue ammo, which adds variety to the existing green &amp; red ones. Also, this set provides a aircraft lower fuselage piece that, though I&#39;m not 100% about this, isn&#39;t available outside of the Lego City theme.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Technically, only one new minifigure comes with the Gunship in the form of two identical Shock Troopers. They are an updated reiteration of the ones that came in the first version of the AT-AP in 2008, but with new helmets, typical Clone Wars clone heads, new torso printing, and leg printing. Ahsoka is the same one found in the Umbaran MHC set, while the &quot;new&quot; Anakin is a combination of parts from previous Anakin minifigures. In my opinion, it would have been nice to include a new bounty hunter Asajj Ventress with helmet or Barriss Offee with hair piece, but sadly my wish didn&#39;t come to fruition.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set was fun to build. Multiple plate layers hold the bottom of the ship together, while a vertical technic beam adds support to the gunship.&nbsp;Though it is symmetrical, there was no feeling of tediousness from having to repeat-build sections of the gunship.</p>

<p>What I really liked about the design was that the interior was completely open&nbsp;from the cockpit to the rear hatches, so theoretically a minifigure could&nbsp;&quot;walk&quot; between the two places. Yes, I know that it shouldn&#39;t matter because minifigures can&#39;t walk themselves,&nbsp;but it&#39;s always been a pet-peeve of mine since childhood. As a kid, I would wonder how the minifigs would get from one place to another if a solid wall was in the way, especially&nbsp;between different areas on&nbsp;a spaceship.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;model holds together well and accurately portrays the gunship from the television series, even down to the wing detail. I will say though that the landing&nbsp;fins seem unnecessary, since they&#39;re a bit too flimsy and the gunship stands upright just fine without them. Plus, the fins are attached to the wings of the ship, making for awkward angles when trying to position them.</p>

<p>The cockpit seating can be removed from the gunship by flipping up the translucent red windshield and sliding it out for the placement of two minifig pilots. It can be a bit tough to slide out though, thanks to the friction of the technic axle 3L with stud used to hold it in place, but it&#39;s not too bad.</p>

<p>Be careful of unintentionally firing the spring shooters on top of the model! I almost lost one of the ammo pieces, but thankfully the set comes with a spare for that reason.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Job well done in replicating the gunship seen in the series. I am pleased with the design and believe this is a great model that fits in well with my Clone Wars set collection. I just wish there could have been a few more figures with this set, perhaps to replace the Anakin that we&#39;ve seen countless times before now.</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-11-04T21:58:24.5Z","Versatile and particular gunship","<p>When I saw it the first time in&nbsp;<em>The Clone Wars</em>, I was very impressed by this strange starship. After finding it in&nbsp;<em>Rebels&nbsp;</em>too, I decided to buy the Lego version, that appeared to me very detailed and full of functionalities. And so it was.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was pretty big, while the completed model is a bit smaller than the box could make you expect. Parts are divided in four bags. Instructions are contained only in one book.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I found very rare parts in this set. Starting from the two pieces used to realize the cockpit, and going on with all the transparent-colored parts that complete the cockpit. You can also get propeller blades you can only find in City or similar-themed sets. Cannons are of the new kind, but they are almost spread at the moment. It&#39;s also used a typical airplane part, the one for the tail.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures aren&#39;t as rare as some of the parts: Anakin is the same of many sets, so nothing to say about him; Ahsoka is a bit rarer (it&#39;s my first copy of het), and she got two lightsabers as in&nbsp;<em>The Clone Wars</em>&nbsp;last seasons; shocktroopers&nbsp;don&#39;t appear in many sets, so they can be considered rare.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was faster than I expected when I started to work on it. It took me just some separated moments between an afternoon and an evening. It was nice to add the &quot;strange&quot; parts that protrude from the hull, as I enjoyed building the cockpit. The experience wasn&#39;t boring, but however I didn&#39;t find it exciting. I was only disappointed by the difficult of lifting him and keeping it in my hands: due to doors and movable parts and other things, I was always pushing the wrong part, risking to cause some damage.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like the completed model very much. It&#39;s very detailed, yes, but the fact I love more is that it&#39;s full of functionalities: and I&#39;m not talking about the shooters (they are so common!), but about the movable parts that are everywhere (doors, cannons, wings, &quot;antennas&quot;). It looks awful, it&#39;s not so small and it&#39;s enough full of &quot;strange&quot; parts to make you not concentrate on the whole model; I do like this last thing. It can host some troopers inside, and so it&#39;s perfect to take the place of LAATs&nbsp;while reaching Imperial era.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I have to say that it&#39;s quite similar to original model, that however is very high detailed. I think it would have been difficult to reply all those details in a 60&euro; Lego set! And about the price, I think that it&#39;s appropriate: not too much, not too few. They maybe could have have added Ventress, or Barriss, or a different character, because Anakin is so widespread that I got like 5 identical copies of him.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<p>&ndash; Full of details</p>

<p>&ndash; A lot of playable parts</p>

<p>&ndash; It can storage some minifigures</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; A bit inaccurate (however you won&#39;t notice the differences with original model)</p>

<p>&ndash; Minifigures&nbsp;could be a bit rarer</p>

<p>&ndash; When building it, and also when completed, it&#39;s not so easy to be lifted</p>
