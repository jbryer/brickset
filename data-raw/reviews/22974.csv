<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Petty good, though it was pretty annoying to put on the stickers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Definitely worth it, I really liked that you got the robotic cops, but I think that it would have been even better if they had added bad cop.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very fun, though it took me longer than I expected. Once I had the treads put together and the stickers on it was great, and I love that it didn&#39;t feel too hard to build but still a little challenging.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><strong>VERY&nbsp;</strong>fun to play with, it&#39;s my first motorcycle and I love the functions on the cop truck/car thing. I like using the spike strip a lot. I think that I will play with it a LOT.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>SUUUPER GOOD!!! I would definitely&nbsp;recommend it to anyone. It&#39;s just hard enough to be past beginner level, but not by much. Everyone that I know who has it loves it.</p>

"Ephseb","2014-03-04T21:07:37.39Z","Worth the money, get this while you can!","<p>This is my first review, I apologize for eventual beginner&#39;s mistakes. Because I live in Europe, I have not seen the movie yet.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box size is ok, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part value of this set is just stunning. No part feels out of place, and all of them can be put to good use in MOCs.</p>

<p>My favorites are:</p>

<p>The night vision goggles: Simple, yet very effective - nice details, while keeping the Lego feel -&nbsp; the only bad thing is that there isn&#39;t a second one of these in case you lose it.</p>

<p>Wyldstyle&#39;s hood: I hope to see this mold in future Star Wars sets. Just paint the inside black and add it to your favorite villain (Darth Maul, Sidious..)</p>

<p>The bulletproof vests: Though the &quot;Super Secret Police&quot; writing may disturb some, it is just awesome to finally see a realistic vest in Lego form.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Emmet: nice, but nothing special as he appears in all of the movie sets.</p>

<p>Wyldstyle: good figure overall, with a cool head and an even better hood piece. I included her into my city as a graffiti artist.</p>

<p>Police robots: Cool, though one of the heads feels strange compared to the other 2. Even if you don&#39;t like robots, these can easily be changed into regular police forces.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Though there&#39;s nothing really difficult about it, the model took me about half an hour to complete.</p>

<p>I recommend refitting the interior of the police car to seat 4 figures. Simply put 10 of &quot;Plate 1x2 w/ 1 Knob&quot; in the car, place the steering wheel on the first one and you&#39;re ready to go.</p>

<p>Note: I did not apply any of the stickers to be able to use the parts for other builds in the future.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Wyldstyle&#39;s Super Cycle looks nice, but also over-the-top crazy with its giant exhausts, flames and back wheel.</p>

<p>The police hummvee looks impressive and menacing, though its difficult to launch the flick-missiles.</p>

<p>The flick-able spike board / nail board / road block fits flawlessly into regular police sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is definitely a must-own set and has a great value even at the regular pricepoint. If you can find it at a lower price, get it immediately.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-10-25T19:09:29.077Z","It's Cycle Chase Time!","<p><strong>Set #70808 Super Cycle Chase: </strong>Welcome to the LEGO Movie&rsquo;s most iconic looking vehicle aside from Bad Cop&rsquo;s car and MetalBeard&rsquo;s Sea Cow. This set is one of the must have sets from the Movie Theme next to a few others I&rsquo;ve previously reviewed. And you want to know why? Read on and find out.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: Like with all the LEGO Movie Theme sets I am really impressed by the design of these boxes. They just look great on the shelf, all together and even just by themselves.&nbsp; Nothing much else to say here, except that there is no cardboard protection for the instructions and stickers.</p>

<p>Instructions: There are two numbered instructions for this set. One for the super cycle and the other for the SSP SWAT truck. The steps are easy to follow and as I&rsquo;ve said in past reviews it is a bit disappointing that none of the LEGO Movie sets include Minifigure Checklists in their instructions.</p>

<p>The second manual has the parts list, while the first one just ends with a promo image from The LEGO Movie Theme. Not much more to say about the design compared to what&rsquo;s been said in previous reviews.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>In this set I don&rsquo;t think we have too many rare pieces, there are a large number of parts though that you might find useful for a MOC or just for the sheer fun of it. There are a lot of the 6047885 which I&rsquo;m not sure on the name, but like how useful they are for some fun things.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Five minifigures are included in this set, none of them are unique, but all of them are fun.</p>

<p>Robo-SWAT: You get three Robo-SWATs in this set, each one has the exact same torso and leg printing and the same swat vest with SSP printing. The only differences are the accessories and head gear their wearing, also while two of them share the same exact heads, the third has a different head print.</p>

<p>Robo-SWAT one has the new gun piece with a red light attached to it and a Naboo pilots helmet with special goggles attached. I&rsquo;m guessing they&rsquo;re night-vision goggles which is a sweet new piece I hope we see a lot more of now that it exists.</p>

<p>Robo-SWAT two has a helmet with clear visor and a pair of handcuffs, nothing really special here.</p>

<p>Robo-SWAT three includes the new gun piece with a Lightsaber hilt attached to it in light stone grey, perhaps a flashlight. He&rsquo;s also wearing the tuque piece, which is a nice piece to find here as it is in black. Perhaps not rare, but definitely a bonus.</p>

<p>Emmet the Special: Is exactly the same as we&rsquo;ve seen in past sets. No accessories except the piece of resistance. What more to say?</p>

<p>Wildstyle: Nothing different with her either, she&rsquo;s got the same look as seen in other sets. And no accessories either unfortunately. Still not bad, love her look and design and she&rsquo;s a great minifigure to have, no matter how many of them you wind up with.</p>

<p>Overall&hellip; The Minifigures in this set aren&rsquo;t much to write home about, they aren&rsquo;t truly unique, but they&rsquo;re a bunch of great characters and it&rsquo;s fun to army build the Robo-SWAT character.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This set features 3 numbered bags, and two manuals as discussed above. The first bag builds three of the minifigures, the wheel trap and the super cycle. Bag number 2 and 3 build the Super Secret Police SWAT vehicle, which is a fun two-step process from bag to bag and makes a very solid looking beefy vehicle design.</p>

<p>The build for the super cycle is really fun, it&rsquo;s great to get the chance to build this model as seen on screen. Many of the steps are fairly simple to follow and you don&rsquo;t have too many issues, the only tricky spot would probably be snapping the parts together to form the giant wheel. The use of stickers for the detail is a minor downside.</p>

<p>The build for the large SWAT vehicle is even more satisfying than the super cycle, it&rsquo;s big and chunky looking and each step makes everything come together. You&rsquo;re going to love how uniform it looks with Bad Cop&rsquo;s car and the Dropship. Again it is unfortunate that they chose all of the logos and such to be stickers, it would have been nice if they&rsquo;d given us printed details for this vehicle so you could customize it more.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>For the Super Cycle I think this model is very impressive, it isn&rsquo;t entirely accurate to the one found on screen, however it&rsquo;s close enough for toy form. It can seat two minifigures, which is a plus and the only play feature for it is the fact that it rolls and moves quite smoothly. It&rsquo;s just an oddly impressive looking bike and very fun to play with or display.</p>

<p>The really big draw for this set is the SWAT vehicle. It&rsquo;s massive, it has four large tires has enough room inside to fit all three Robo-SWAT minifigures, features two flip open panels with flick-fire missiles for a play feature and an opening trunk with a stick of dynamite stored there to toss at the Special and his ride.</p>

<p>The only downside for this model is the lack of functioning doors. It would have been nice to include functional doors on the vehicle, honestly I find myself liking this vehicle model a slightly bit more than the super cycle. It just looks fun and beefy and is a great armoured vehicle for City or other Theme displays where SWAT vehicles are expected.</p>

<p>The unfurling trap to try and make the tires pop or deflate or something is a nice mini-build too, not the best though, it works as a play feature. I just think it could have been designed and executed slightly better than what we got. Mostly because it doesn&rsquo;t fold up nicely and the gimmick used to unfurl it takes a bit of effort to actually get it to work.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend this set. It&rsquo;s a great package with only a few minor flaws, the price is good and the inclusion of five minifigures is great. Plus the super cycle is just an iconic LEGO Movie design that should be enjoyed by everybody. I kind of hope we continue to get the Super Secret Police vehicles because honestly their uniformity and overall great look on display makes me want to have a couple more of these SWAT vehicles and other cars besides Bad Cop&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can only afford a handful of sets from this Theme definitely go for this one.</p>

"brickman3","2015-10-05T15:48:20.453Z","Great set. Not many cons!","<p>I&#39;ve reviewed a lot of sets in my time here on Brickset.Most of them were positive, although I would seldom right a negative one. Here, I have a positive review. This is one of the LEGO Movie set, Super Cycle Chase. It is priced at $49.99, where I live. I say this is a teeny bit overpriced for a set like this, even though it has about 500 pieces. If it were up to me, I would price at maybe $44.99, and yes, I am aware this isn&#39;t much of a difference. Enough about this. Let&#39;s move on to the characters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Emmet:</strong></p>

<p>Classic Emmet. Always getting into trouble. Finding the Piece of Resistance, getting captured, and getting captured again. At least here he gets a straightforward escape route. This is the same Emmet featured in many other LEGO Movie sets, like the Melting Room. His face is double-sided, one side confident and the other side terrified. He has the Piece of Resistance, and his standard construction suit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wyldstyle (Lucy):</strong></p>

<p>One of the more rarer minifigures, Wyldstyle&nbsp;is Emmet&#39;s hero. She looks like a DJ, if you ask me. She also comes with a&nbsp;double-sided face, her hood in the back, and her special jacket. If I can make a comment, the needed to add her to some other sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Robot Cops</strong></p>

<p>Of all of the things Lord Business could use to attack Emmet, he uses robots. Doesn&#39;t he know they aren&#39;t very smart? And on another note, why let them drive a 4x4??? &nbsp;No wonder he has a hard time catching Emmet. At least they can&#39;t be drunk. Well, I don&#39;t know if oil could do that, but still. Anyway, this set comes with three robots. All are one-faced, one with a knit cap, and the other two with pilot helmets and goggles. Two of them have blasters, and the other one has handcuffs. And all three have bullet-proof vests.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only are the minifigures great, so are the models! This set comes with three: the wicked Master Builder Motorcylcle, and Police 4x4, and the Robot Tire Popper, all of which are unique and cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Master Builder Motorcycle:</strong></p>

<p>A special motorcycle that Wyldstyle built for Emmet, this is a very grand model. It looks like it was made from junk, but it is quick and efficient! &nbsp;The sticker details are incredible, and the flames look so real. The wheels move well too. The front ones get stuck sometimes, but I found the issue. The seats fit both Emmet&nbsp;and Wyldstyle perfectly, although I expected more leg room. Anyway, this is incredible!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Robo Police 4x4:</strong></p>

<p>Again, great model. The massive tires match the rugged look greatly, and the lights and sirens look exquisite on top. The cockpit can hold up to two robots, and there is a place to hang handcuffs. In the back, there is a little hatch which holds a stick of dynamite, and on the sides there are flick missiles. It&#39;s incredible how technology is advancing these days, know what I mean?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Robot Tire Popper:</strong></p>

<p>I know it&#39;s a bit strange for me to review this tiny thing, but I thought it could be an interesting addition. It isn&#39;t much, I&#39;ll tell you that. It has the small robo-police&nbsp;logo on each side, with a small blue lightbulb on top. A small three-hole round piece is used to activate the popper, which flies out to stop the motorcycle. I know this isn&#39;t much, but I really like it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, there&#39;s my review. I hope you enjoyed it! 9/10</p>
