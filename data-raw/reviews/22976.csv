But I AM into Creator. And I must admit it&#39;s definitely eye-catching, whether you speak about the box in a shop, or some other pics on the Net. And especially models themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The number of things you can do with the monkey, posing its hands, legs, tail, mimics etc. is considerable. Not every pose or gesture is children-friendly, and unfortunately the toucan is usually overpowered.&nbsp;So the main value of this set is displaying - depending on your kind of humour - and playability. Also, quite a lot of nice parts, including many hinges, axles and some parts in rare colors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, again - pictures tell the truth this time, this is what you get! Very nice.&nbsp;</p>

Having stumbled across the Fantastic Flyers, and then the Red Creatures, I&#39;ve become a bit hooked on this wonderful creator theme. No branding, no pretense, just solid design and 3 great models in one box. How does the Woodland Creatures live up to the legacy?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions are very clear and have few parts to add per step. You get one book per animal.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The colors are perhaps a bit confused in this box, with just a few bits in some because of the toucans beak. Most of the other sets in this theme tend to have a dominant colour theme. There&#39;s a good range of articulated joints and hinges for creating your own creatures. In my opinion these sets come into their own bolstering a collection with some particular colours and parts, and this is no exception.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite fun and the monkeys head in particular is very cleverly put together. It&#39;s easy to build in stages too and other than a pair of arms and legs there is little repetition. There are a variety of handy techniques on display which you can build into your own models later so they&#39;re very informative builds.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main model is really impressive. The Monkeys face is highly posable with articulated eyebrows and rotating eyes and an opening mouth. His arms are less flexible (he has no elbows!) but he can stand happily and give big hugs. He gets a Banana to play with and a Toucan Friend. The bear is a little less &#39;interesting&#39; to build and leaves a fair few parts, but he is very cute!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Another strong showing in this theme. Monkey (and bear) lovers will be overjoyed, and the parts supplied are a fine addition to a growing collection. If you can find this set for &pound;10 or less it represents a great buy. Sadly, it now looks to have been discontinued.</p>
