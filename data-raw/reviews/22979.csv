Compared to the original LEGO Star Wars Brickmaster this book is a bit more intriguing, however I&rsquo;m still not a huge fan of the prices for these. You&rsquo;re paying a premium for the book style format when you only get a certain number of pieces and only two Minifigures. However let&rsquo;s get on with the key points for this title.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Presentation</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As usual the look of the book is extremely impressive. There is the standard instructions for multiple model builds broken up by the separate titles for each &lsquo;chapter&rsquo;. Fun comics break up the instructions here giving us some fun bit of reading. There&rsquo;s little more to say about a Brickmaster book, we haven&rsquo;t seen them for a few years now actually and it seems that these types of books are fading out in favor of actual content and the Build Your Own Adventure style books which are slightly cheaper.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Commander Gree and the Commando Droid are included in this book. I&rsquo;ll go into more details on the prints of them in the Polybag contents review, however it is interesting to note that we have a named character included with this title, the previous LEGO Star Wars Brickmaster just featured a generic Clone Trooper.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Contents</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">What can I say about the contents? The pages show-off build-instructions for models to explore a simple story with the two included characters. Commander Gree is trying to protect some Kyber Crystals from the Commando Droid, and this is pretty great for the age range involved. It&rsquo;s not as in-depth as other LEGO DK books, however it isn&rsquo;t meant to be. It&rsquo;s a simple build event for younger fans and with that in mind it captures the essence of this Brickmaster design quite well. The artwork is large and colorful, the comic pages are fun to read and tell a simple story and you can&rsquo;t go wrong with Star Wars.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Taking into consideration how times have changed it&rsquo;s hard to rate a book of this sort. That being said I do find that the Brickmaster design overall was fun for what it attempted to do and this book is one of the better offerings, LEGO Star Wars is always popular. It&rsquo;s been four years since this was released and you can often find it at local book stores to this day, I&rsquo;m not crazy about that price though, 33$ in Canada compared to half that price when Costco had them for sale makes it hard to recommend.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Still if you&rsquo;re looking for something to do that&rsquo;s quick and fun it&rsquo;s a great play time option with you and your children. So mildly recommended on that front.</span></span></span></span></p>
