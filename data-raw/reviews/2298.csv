However, FLuffy had been made with a design imperfection: it is impossible to open all three mouths simultaneously. The plant-, grass-, or weed-type elements are also a great addition to any Lego collection. Includes 3 main characters, of course Fluffy, and like a spider. Good set.

"LegoAdventures","2009-12-16T23:19:31.343Z","The Forbidden Corridor","I have to say, that this is a really great Harry Potter set. Many people say that you cannot judge any Harry Potter set without getting all of them, i strongly agree. The fun of Harry Potter Lego is eventually saving up and getting a range of them so you can experience the real Harry Potter feeling. To really have fun with this set you should get the other range of Harry Potter sets that are known with this scene like 4704 Chamber of Winged keys and 4702 The Final Challenge then you can really make the ending scene for Lego Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone, anyway lets get to this magnificent set.

1.) Minifigs: The Minifigs that are included in this set is Harry Potter with his Violet Cape, Grey school uniform, Griffindor emblem and tie, Yellow face with his glasses, scar and simple smile with Black mopped hair. Ron with his black cape which has little silver stars and swirls on one side and black on the other, Grey school uniform, Griffindor emblem and tie, yellow face with his freckles and happy expression with Orange mopped hair .
Hermione with her black cape which has little silver stars and swirls on one side and black on the other, Griffindor emblem and tie, yellow face with her bright eyes with eyelashes and smile and here brown curled hair with fringe. 
Each minifig has a different colour wand:
Ron: Light grey.
Harry Potter: Medium Brown.
Hermione: Light cream.

2.) Build/Devil Snare/Fluffy/Overall: The Build is quiet simple and not very difficult. It's quiet a medium sized set not small, not big but a decent sized model. You start of building the Bottom area the Devil snare section is very clever and unique and is a great addition to the set. There is a red peice which when pushed down opens up the huge leaf resembling the main Devil 
Snare root, both leafs can be moved up and down and when a Minifig is dropped from the trap door, you can open the Devil Snare and shut the leafs so the Minifig is trapped. You then build the Spiral Staircase and finish with some spiderwebs with little black spiders and a few arches and pillions. You then build the top floor section which contains the trap door a few tan pieces and 2 Fire pieces, it also features Fluffy the Huge Three headed dog. ((It is possible to open all the heads to the Dog, but you cannot open them all to there full jaw, the Head in the middle can be opened to it's full jaw and then the two heads on the sides can be opened a slight bit, but it still looks great and adds a lot of value to the set)). Fluffy is quiet rare so don't lose him :). Last but not least the door and Treasure chest section which leads into Fluffy's room. After building the Top floor section the Spiral staircase leads to the Front door and Treasure chest area. This area includes a large door with fire pieces and a Silver key to open the door and the key can fit in the door hole. A treasure chest with a Flute to calm Fluffy down and send him to sleep and an arch top area with a roof.

Overall this set is a superb addition to any Harry Potter set, it includes a lot of Interesting and Rare pieces and will be enjoyed by any Lego collector. 
Thankyou for reading :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-06T05:42:27.657Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Forbidden Corridor Review","This set is the only set with Fluffy - a dog which has 3 heads. It's a really good set to have and to build. This model is very sturdy and there're no stickers which you have to put on. We also get three minifigs: This set comes with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. This model comes with lot's of great stuff as well. For example we get a treasure chest, a spider, a translucent blue flame and a flute. I think it's the only set where you can get a flute so far. I also like the green ceiling. It's an exclusive piece to the LEGO Harry Potter theme. We also get a sviwel spiral stairs and we also get a plant which can hold a minifig in it. The plant opens and closes very nicely. We also get a floor which you can open to get to that plant. Overall I can't really complain about this set and I think it's worth the money.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"jab0309","2010-07-06T08:53:03.057Z","One of the best Harry Potter sets!","<p>&nbsp; This is a really cool Lego set! It has the regular minifigure trio, which is always nice. But the real highlight of this set is the Fluffy the 3-headed dog figure. The figure is sculpted very well and looks amazing. The whole trapdoor function gives this set a lot of playability. The Devil's Snare portion of the set has a lever that lets you open and close its jaws, which also adds to the set's playability. One of my favorite things to do was to drop a minifigure through the trapdoor into the jaws of the Devil's Snare, which closes on the minifigure. It also includes great pieces such as a full spiral staircase and the flute. You also get a blue-colored fire piece, which is always nice. Another cool feature of this set is that it connects with the sets 4704 The Room of the Winged Keys and 4702 The Final Challenge.</p><p>&nbsp;Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Get the whole minifigure trio (Harry, Ron, Hermione)</li>
    <li>Excellent Fluffy piece</li>
    <li>Great parts (flute, full-length staircase, doorway piece, lots of baseplates)</li>
    <li>Great playability&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>None that I can think of</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;So in my opinion, this is one of the best Lego sets that I own. You can play with this set very well and the instructions even include a couple of alternative models you can build with this set. This is a must-have if you are a fan of Lego Harry Potter.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"gigdoat2","2011-04-02T20:15:45.403Z","A must have for your LEGO HP  collection!","<p>If you have a Lego Harry Potter collection, you should really get this set. It's nice to have, it has nice playability. It is mostly for playing with though, because it does not much like The Forbidden Corridor in the movie. But it is still a good set for play or display. I'll first review the minifigures, then the corridor.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>Harry Potter wears his Original Gryffindor uniform and yellow skin, before they made new&nbsp;minifigures in 2004. He has&nbsp;a rare purple cape, and black, messy hair. His face has round glasses, eyes, mouth, and his lightning scar on his forehead. He comes with a brown wand.</p>
<p>Ron Weasley has the original Gryffindor uniform, yellow skin,&nbsp;orange hair, and a face with&nbsp;eyes, a&nbsp;happy smirk and freckles. He also has a black cape and a grey wand.</p>
<p>Hermione Granger has the original Gryffindor uniform and yellow skin. She has a black cape, a serious looking female face, and brown hair to her shoulders. She has a tan wand.</p>
<h4>The Corridor</h4>
<p>Now onto the set. It has a staircase that each stair can turn, so the stairs can be turned onto each other so nobody can walk up it, or to a staircase(as depicted). The stair case leads up to a room, with a door and a treasure chest. It has the three headed dog Fluffy, the only time she was released in a set. Of course fluffy isn't scale with the minifigures, because if you saw the movie a person was the size of her toe. It has the trap door, which can be opened to so they can jump in.......right into Devil's Snare! There is also a flute to put Fluffy to sleep though in the movie it was a harrp. The set is a bit fragile.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a nice set, a necessity for your Harry Potter collection! 5/5&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"orybloodmyre","2011-09-02T15:37:34.497Z","stock up on lego dog food if you get this set!","<p>I got this set back in 2001. It was my second set after the strange coloured&nbsp;hogwarts classroom set. I loved this set though I was confused by the staircase, I mean Ron, Harry and Hermione put fluffy to sleep, fall through the trapdoor, defeat the devils snare, and go up the staircase to find... Fluffy again! It was good if you had another set to attach to this, but otherwise the set was fairly basic and the staircase greatly annoyed me!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I loved that it came with fluffy, I remember creating a MOC using my green lego dragon from a decade before and having two dungeons, one with fluffy, one with a dragon. Not exactly harry potter cannon, but neither were the other suggestions on the backs of the HP boxes. Some of those suggestions were simply ludicrous, most involved throwing a&nbsp;chest out of some sort of tower (see the potions class box and the forbidden corridor box!)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was a good beginner set to get hermione, ron and harry. I wasnt impressed with Harry 'invisibility cloak' as it simply didnt look like an invisibility cloak, it looked like harry was trying to start a blue cape trend in hogwarts, which was evidently unsuccessful as ron and hermione werent good friends enough to humour him and wear one themselves!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To date this is the only set with fluffy and an iconic scene from the books, not the movie, as harry doesnt use his flute in the movie, and hermione doesnt use blue fire!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well worth getting, and you can get it for around twenty pound which isnt too bad as it was 16.99 a decade ago!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
