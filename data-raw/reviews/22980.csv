Part one is the book itself, part two will focus on the models found inside the polybag found in the newer BRICKMASTER products. Now that Brickset separates them between book and polybag I&rsquo;ll be reviewing them separately.</span></span></span></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><font color=""#000000""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"">Battle in the Canyons:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""> The first chapter of this book gives us enough pieces to build two macro scaled vehicles. Slightly larger than most polybag sets these are more or less micro scaled Clone Wars vehicles. The V-19 is the better model of the two, capturing the look of the vehicle quite nicely and featuring excellent detail work. The wings can be positioned into landing pose and in flight and the model is fun to play with zooming around the skies of your play area wherever that may be.</span></span></span></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""><font color=""#000000"">The Separatist Cannon is an impressive build as well, but slightly weaker. It uses hinge joints for the legs which means there isn&rsquo;t as much mobility for displaying it, the model does a great job of capturing the likeness of the much larger arsenal used by the Separatist faction. If the legs were designed and built a different way so as to be more poseable it would be an awesome display piece and play piece.</font></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""><font color=""#000000"">This chapter uses all of the pieces in the set for both builds, right out of the gate you know what to expect. The other models will have left over pieces not used in the construction.</font></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><font color=""#000000""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"">Ambush in the Forest:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""> The second chapter of the book details construction instructions for building a WT-RT Walker (Wet Terrain Recon Transport) and a Vespula Fighter for the Commando Droid. The WT-RT looks a tad odd, however it is no different from similar small walkers in the Star Wars universe. The large wing pieces have been used for its feet making it slightly larger than expected. Almost goofy, it also limits the number of poses you can put it in since the legs are all built into a few giant segments with no real knee articulation to speak of. The gray barrel on the front for a cannon is an odd design choice also, though I suppose including the piece in this set it was necessary to find alternate uses for it when not built into the previous chapter&rsquo;s separatist model.</span></span></span></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""><font color=""#000000"">Speaking of which, this time the Separatist model is pretty simple. It uses a lot less pieces to become a small one-man fighter craft. This model is fun and fun to play with, it may be a bit on the unusual side and as I said it is very simple in build and design, but it stands out to me more as the better executed build for this chapter.</font></span></span></span></p>

It doesn&rsquo;t feature too many difficult steps and has your standard three fin engine look for a desert speeder, with an open air cockpit. The vehicle stands out to me more because it is a far more solid build than the previous WT-RT. It actually looks like a passable vehicle and doesn&rsquo;t suffer from the use of or lack of parts to make a proper vehicle.</span></span></span></font></p>

It&rsquo;s pretty much a STAP on steroids, bulking it out slightly and making a very tiny assault craft for the Commando Droid. Of the chapters in this book I feel that this set of models is the second best on offer next to the micro-scaled vehicles of chapter one. The PH-STAP is a fun to play with model that&rsquo;s fast to build and doesn&rsquo;t suffer from being too cluttered or improper piece use.</font></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><font color=""#000000""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;"">Ice Mountain Chase:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""> In this final chapter we are given instructions to build the KD81 Cargo Skiff and the Ice Speeder. I find the Separatist vehicle in this set to be the best of the bunch for all of the later chapters, where chapter 1 could use better executed leg designs the rest are simple, fast, and fun builds that work out quite nicely. This Cargo Skiff is a perfect example of this as it uses the most parts to make a Separatist vehicle while still keeping the design consistent with the other vehicles in the previous chapters. About the only problem with this model is the control area, it is a bit awkward and make it hard for the Mini-Figure to stand straight up because you have to angle it just right to get him to stand on it.</span></span></span></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""><font color=""#000000"">Meanwhile, the Ice Speeder, like the Desert Speeder before it is a fun little build that is great fun to play with. Commander Gree swoops after the Commando Droid in a one-man craft designed to skim across great ice flows. The engine designs are smaller than you&rsquo;d think a craft of this size would need, however repulsors underneath the craft probably help it to glide rapidly across the ice and snow. The wing design even looks like a smaller version of what the rebel fleet will incorporate into their Snowspeeders on Hoth. An all around fun design and really great fun to play with.</font></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""><font color=""#000000"">Overall I find the numerous models in this set to be a big improvement over some of what we saw in the first LEGO Star Wars BRICKMASTER book. With a few exceptions all of them are fast and fun to build and play with, re-enacting the adventures found in the book. Only the WT-RT and the Separatist Cannon have any glaring flaws in their design, and it&rsquo;s all due to the legs for both walker types. Or mobile artillery if you prefer.</font></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;""><font color=""#000000"">I&rsquo;d recommend hunting down your own copy if you want to have some fun building and playing in that galaxy far, far away. Bricklink some of the parts in this set and you can have all four chapters to play with, without having to buy multiples of the book, which can add up expense wise. And the Mini-Figure choice was a good one too, Commander Gree is always fun and you can never have too many Commando Droids. Recommended.</font></span></span></span></p>
