Cars that go fast around Pikes Peak in Colorado. <br></p><p>Lovely green red and white Octan color scheme as always. New wheels look like the wheels on most creator sets as one side is racing style pattern and the other is steel rim look. Tires are also nicely detailed. Rolls well too. Has 6 stickers to put on. There is a tiny sticker that goes on a 1x2 cheese slope for the instrument panel. Had to use tweeters to get it on straight.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing that is disappointing is the trophy. Its light grey! On the box and online it looks like it was pearl light silver. I would have a facial expression like McKayla Maroney if I received a grey trophy.</p><h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Octan team!<br></li><li>New black rims and tires<br></li><li>New style race car.&nbsp;</li><li>Looks awesome<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers<br></li><li>Ugly grey trophy<br></li></ul>
<p>Overall this is a fantastic set for $10. Will fit in nicely with the Octan F1 truck. About that trophy....</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

"CortezTheKiller","2014-01-17T12:02:14.267Z","Best small race car for a while","<p>Nice small set for a quick build. &nbsp;The style of the car is ambiguous - you can either see it as a Pikes Peak racer or a Le Mans type sports car. &nbsp;Works either way and is a good design: decent size, takes a minifig with ease, and is very sturdy. &nbsp;I really like the way the spoiler is mounted - reminds me of many an AFOL custom model on the internet.</p><p>Personally I would have preferred a different colour scheme. &nbsp;I know that it is meant to match the Octan range, but for this model I would have liked to see something a bit different and original.</p><p>One more thing: some LEGO plastic feels much less solid and substantial than other LEGO plastic, and it seems to be model by model rather than part by part. &nbsp;I don't know if they have different quality standards in different factories, but the parts on this model definitely fall into the 'feels cheap than other' category.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice original design</li><li>Good playability</li><li>New rims</li><li>Much better than recent small car designs e.g. found in the Creator range</li><li>Lots of potential for customising</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Unoriginal colour scheme</li><li>Stickers - <i>ugh...</i></li><li>Lower than normal quality plastic</li></ul>

"ra226","2014-05-24T08:53:58.59Z","Race Cars have come a long way...","<p>We picked this set up for my son for his birthday--and I mean literally, the day of his birth, so it&#39;ll be a while before he can actually play with it. &nbsp;Meanwhile, I can enjoy it for him! &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This Race Car has a clean, fast look, thanks to multiple layers of curved tiles blending into one another, and an almost completely&nbsp;studless design. &nbsp;It looks good from just about any angle--personally, I love the lights, and particularly, the tail lights (a pair of red, round tiles on each side, </span>which very much resemble those on a Ferrari). &nbsp;While I like the styling of the spoiler, it feels a bit too tall to me. &nbsp;I&#39;m very glad the wheels are black and not grey--really gives them a stock car feel.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">I don&#39;t personally care much about accessories, but those who do may find this set lacking. &nbsp;The only addition besides the car and driver is a trophy, which really should have been chrome silver. &nbsp;I could also see including some kind of minimal finish line, or maybe a girl with a checkered flag or something, but at $10, I&#39;m happy with what I got.</span></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">Pros</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Traditional Octan color scheme of Red, White, and Green</li>
	<li>Almost completely studless design</li>
	<li>Layered curves give a detailed yet streamlined look</li>
	<li>Not just a steering wheel, but an instrument panel, too</li>
	<li>Nicely detailed minifig, torso is printed front and back</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lacking in accessories, and the trophy would have been far better in chrome silver</li>
	<li>Stickers, if that bothers you (I had no problem with these, and they look nice)</li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">I found myself comparing it to my own first &quot;Lego Race Car,&quot; set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6634-1/Stock-Car"">#6634</a>, the Shell stock car. &nbsp;This set, from 1986, looks absolutely archaic now, but they do share the same yellow and transparent headlights. &nbsp;I also miss the hinged roof of the old days--having to partially dismantle Lego to get the guy in somehow feels like cheating.</span></p>

<p>This is a perfect stand-alone $10 set, and I&#39;m looking forward, in a few years, to giving it to my son. &nbsp;Meanwhile, his sister and I will &quot;take good care of it&quot; for him...</p>

"Faire","2014-06-22T19:32:14.793Z","My son's first LEGO.","<p>Well, my son turned 2 this spring. And he got this as his first real LEGO ever (I am not counting Duplo, of course) for his delayed birthday. Sigh... Anyway.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of studless&nbsp;parts, very different from LEGO cars in my days.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Yep, present.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I really like it. I was a bit surprised with the final size, it&#39;s quite big. I like the parts, they aren&#39;t too unique but fit in the place really well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very aerodynamic&nbsp;look, almost no studs to be seen. Both front and rear lights are great. It drives very well. Feels quite solid, looks far better than I expected.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Bargain for its price!</p>

"germancho","2017-07-14T19:20:32.91Z","Not great for racing","<p>It&#39;s a sleek and colorful race car set, but ironically, it&#39;s not very good for racing. It has very bad balance, and it tends to skid on its rear after you give it a good push. Parts-wise, I appreciate the black rims and trophy.</p>
