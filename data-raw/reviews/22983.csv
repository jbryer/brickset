","<p>I had 10 U.S. dollars burning a hole in my pocket, I have a child who loves Lego, I am a grown&nbsp;child with responsibilities who loves Lego too. The Light Repair Truck came along at just the right time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as the instructions - I wish all instruction manuals were as easy to understand a Lego manuals. &nbsp; The mini figure included, we called Walter, &nbsp;is a go-teed, safety glasses wearing, upstanding member of the Lego community he works in. He takes a great deal of pride in his work. His tools include two safety cones, a hard hat, a hammer and wrench. Dressed in working man's blues has only one face expression (happy to be here!) and no prints or tampos (as the Hot Wheels collectors call it) on his back.</p>

<p>Between making lunch, unloading groceries and changing diapers I was able to put this kit together, with the help of my son, in about 25 minutes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The complete model was just as fun to play with as putting it together. The cherry picker rotates on the back of the truck and has some articulation build into it, making it easy for the Lego people to reach those city light or peek into windows of unsuspecting citizens. I had also picked up the Ginger bread man mini-fig at the same time. Gingerbread man and Walt got to drive around town and looked for lights that needed repair. There was never a dull moment when you get those two together.</p>

<p>Overall &nbsp;the kit, the price and the challenge was all at the right level. I was very happy with that.</p>

The shape is excellent, the colour scheme really stands out (the stickers are a necessary evil here, and they&#39;re very&nbsp;nicely designed), and most important of all, the cherry picker is excellent : compact, efficient, with just enough friction to keep the exact position you put it into. The attaching mechanism for when it is not in use is simple&nbsp;yet very clever, and the two extra studs on the rotating base are put to good use for transporting the traffic cones.<br />
The traffic light seems a little bit awkward to me, but maybe it is because where I live they are usually not merged with the city lamps.</p>

<p>Overall the best value you could get for the money, and a very nice addition to any city scene.</p>
