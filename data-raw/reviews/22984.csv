#60055: Monster truck is an introductory to what looks to be a great lineup for 2014 and&nbsp;not just for&nbsp;CITY but across the entire range.&nbsp;It's nice to see LEGO putting out stand-alone city sets that have good ""price-per-piece,""&nbsp;high playability, and a varied parts list. Since this is such a tiny set there isn't cause for a lengthy review so here are the basics:</p><p>Build: A fairly standard vehicle build with the exception that the normal car chassis sits upon a constructed chassis to help give the truck some added height.&nbsp;Outside of that the step-by-step process is quite mild. The biggest fault is that this truck does not have the same suspension as does the truck from the monster truck transporter.&nbsp;Also, it does not&nbsp;have the big tires from that other set. A big oversight if you ask me.</p><p>Minifig: A single fig(as you can plainly see in the pic) comes with this set. I'm not 100% sure what the&nbsp;LEGO artists were going for on his shirt but it looks as if grass is emanating out of his belt and an odd symbol reminiscent of Final Fantasy games is displayed on his back.</p><p>Playability: For young kids, more specifically young boys, this is an exceptional set. I'm not sure of any boy who wouldn't enjoy crushing other LEGO cars with this truck or sending it off a ramp or devastating a CITY scene by running over innocent pedestrians.</p><p>Parts: Nothing unique. All the same parts every other CITY vehicle has.</p>
<ul><li>High playability</li><li>Good color scheme</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Needs more pronounced shocks</li><li>Lack of true monster truck tires</li><li>Stickers(I personally hate stickers)</li></ul>
<p>Conclusion: Overall a very nice and&nbsp;simple set which has great playability and makes a good template for creating more trucks of a similar style.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,3
