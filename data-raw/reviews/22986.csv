"Legobuilderguy","2014-03-19T13:02:09.473Z","Camping trip","<p>Picked this set up a couple of weeks ago and have to say, it looks pretty good. The build is pretty straight forward and rather easy so it will be a quick build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The camper has a nice little inside space for the two included minifigs to sit in with a little table and sleeping platform. Also has a little TV (which is a sticker) for them to watch. The nicest part of the camper though is the canoe which sits on top of the RV.</p>

<p>Under the canoe is a trap door which can hold the paddles and life jackets. It looks very nice sitting on top but I have to wonder how the campers get the canoe up and down as there are no ladders, which is an easy fix.</p>

<p>If you have sets 7639 and 4435 this one looks good with it or even with the cabin set 5766.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty easy build, fairly quick.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks really good when completed. Nice color scheme with the white/grey and green trim line.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very nice little set that looks really good overall. 19.99 US so PPP maybe a bit high but to me the set is worth it.</p>

"ra226","2014-05-12T06:26:52.5Z","Ready for a quiet get away at the lake","<p>The Camper Van is really an an excellent little set. &nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">For its size, there&#39;s tons of playability, and the design details are outstanding, both inside and out. &nbsp;</span>The white with beige/green/gray color scheme looks good, even if a bit modern compared to what you might see on the road today.</p>

<p>The exterior is very well done--the way the roof extends over the windshield, the orange round lights at the corners, the designs on the stickers, the running boards and side mirrors--it&#39;s as if every piece were considered individually. &nbsp;The only flaw I can see (and it took a few days for me to notice it) is that the front wheels have more clearance in the wheel wells than the back.</p>

<p>The interior is easy to access thanks to a removable roof and swing-out wall, and there are lots of great accessories: a bed, a breakfast table, and each minifig has a mug of coffee--perfect for those cold mornings waking up with the sunrise. &nbsp;Then it&#39;s off for a peaceful day on the lake in the canoe. &nbsp;There&#39;s even a plasma TV to cozy up in front of at the end of the day. &nbsp;When it&#39;s time to pack up (much too soon!), t<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">he oars and vests stow in a compartment on the roof, and the canoe rides on top.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Finally, I&#39;ll mention that this set really spoke to me in a different way than most. &nbsp;It suggests quiet time, apart from the world, just the two of us; I think it reminded me of my honeymoon, actually. Perhaps it&#39;s why I wanted this set the moment I saw it, and wasn&#39;t even sure why. &nbsp;</span>I even find myself&nbsp;noticing RVs now when I&#39;m on the road--in particular, Lego really nailed that abstract mountain-and-stream logo on the panels!</p>

<p>Anyway, this is a fantastic little set and if you&#39;re looking for a camper, you won&#39;t be disappointed.</p>

"Michel_Ange","2019-08-12T03:00:35.897Z","Big, but somewhat empty","<p>It is difficult not to compare this set to the 7639 from 2009, to which it appears to be a bigger and modernized version.&nbsp;Visually, the front has seen a net improvement, somewhat reminiscing of some VW designs, and the medium green is much more striking than the older lime.</p>

<p>However if we compare with previous models, the visual improvement doesn&#39;t seem to translate well in play value terms :<br />
6351 from 1992, 17*4 (68 sq/studs), two chairs, table, built-in kitchen, TV brick, trailer with brickbuilt boat ;<br />
7639 from 2009, 16*6 (96 sq/studs), two chairs, table, built-in kitchen, TV&nbsp;sticker, overcab, surfboard, bicycle, campfire and camping chairs&nbsp;;<br />
60057 from 2014, 20*6 (120 sq/studs), one chair, table, bed, TV sticker, overcab, roof compartment, canoe.<br />
Overall, as the size increases&nbsp;the shape gets more realistic and we get some more accessories,&nbsp;but the feeling of practicality, that specific &quot;we can&nbsp;cram a full house inside a small vehicle&quot; feeling that&#39;s so fun to recreate in Lego seems to fade out, and that makes me somewhat sad.</p>

<p>As a conclusion, a nice vehicle to have in your collection, but still not quite as good as it could have been with a few more details.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:53:00.523Z","Impressive Upgrade of 7639.","<p><strong>Set # 60057 Camper Van: </strong>LEGO has released many versions of a camper van over the years, this set is another iteration in the LEGO City Theme and so I will be making a few comparisons between this one and the 7639 Camper set which I&rsquo;ve reviewed previously.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: The box for this set makes it stand out quite nicely, showing off the camper van and the features of the set in general. It&rsquo;s a nice LEGO City box from 2014, the back shows all of the features and the fact that this is modular, using numbered bags in the build. The bottom row of cross promotional images shows all of the sets in the Transportation sub-theme from this year.</p>

<p>Instructions: The set is broken up between two numbered bags, each build is separated into two numbered manuals. Bag 1 is built using Manual 1 and Bag 2 for Manual 2, this comes off as a bit weak honestly. It means there are more booklets to keep track of when storing this set later on. The instructions themselves are still very good, showing off all of the steps for each section of build in easy to follow large pictures.</p>

<p>Sticker Sheet: This set uses stickers for details and there will be a fair number of them, be mindful, the sheet is not protected when put in the box and so may wind up being damaged depending on the packing machine at the time.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The largest draw of this set from a parts perspective may be the inclusion of the new Canoe piece first introduced in Lone Ranger. You&rsquo;ll also find a clear grey Astromech Dome for an R4 unit in grey being used on the roof as part of the Canoe holding system.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Male Camper: Dressed in an orange sweater, this Minifigure has a double-sided torso print, the back is limited with the hood of the sweater pulled down, however it&rsquo;s nice to see an orange torso. Officially he has no accessories, unofficially there is a red coffee mug that is sitting on the dash in the front next to his driver&rsquo;s seat.</p>

<p>Female Camper: The female in this set is using the bowl cut hairpiece first introduced in The LEGO Movie Theme. It&rsquo;s a great headpiece, and here it&rsquo;s in black. For the torso we have a light blue double-sided print which is fairly common in LEGO City sets.</p>

<p>Overall both Minifigures are standard fare, but look fairly decent.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Bag 1: The build found here includes the lower portion of the vehicle and the two Minifigures, it&rsquo;s hard to define it, however it&rsquo;s a very well thought out build. I appreciate that the lower section of the vehicle doesn&rsquo;t rely on a singular base piece, which I believe 7639 used for the main body of its build. The front windshield also gets built here and I enjoy the SNOT technique used to create side mirrors on this model, with some hinged plates and sloped white 1x2 wedges you&rsquo;ve got instant side view mirrors which look great.</p>

<p>Bag 2: Here you get to build the sides of the van and the roof, this build is less repetitive than 7639, which is always appreciated, the roof is a nice solid build with some great aspects, especially the hidden compartment for the rafting/canoeing equipment. The lack of a ladder to get up to the roof compared with 7639 is a bit disappointing, however with that missing the overall look of this build does have a better aesthetic. My one complaint is the placement of stickers, the sticker sheet doesn&rsquo;t have protection so may wind up creased or mangled straight out of the box, meaning that some stickers could peel up quite easily instead of remaining smooth and flush with the bricks.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>When comparing this version to 7639 there is an obvious improvement over the design for this type of Camper. The roof itself is different, including a small compartment to store the life vests and paddles for use with the canoe. The front of the van also differs, making a more streamlined appearance. The side opens so you can access the interior which features a bed, a table and chairs and not much else. The model is a great looking one, it&rsquo;s nice to have such a variety when it comes to campers of this sort, neither set is ultimately better than the other, both have their pros and cons.</p>

<p>The use of stickers for detail is certainly disappointing, however the previous City model also had stickers for details. I find this model to be slightly more fun than the previous model if only because it has more windows and larger windows to see inside of the vehicle. Also there are no clips to secure the back, which in my opinion broke up the original Camper model just a little too much, however since it was designed to fully open up with both sides I can see where a clip would be needed there.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a wonderful update to the original Camper design first seen in 7639, both versions have their charm, this one is just a bit more complete in overall look and build technique. I recommend picking it up for your LEGO City collection if you haven&rsquo;t done so already, the model stands out wonderfully, in spite of the use of stickers, and there&rsquo;s a lot of potential. I look forward to picking up the new Car &amp; Caravan from 2016 and the Creator Camper vehicle 3-1 is going to be interesting as well just to see how that one improves on the overall design and technique of building a large all-purpose camping vehicle/RV.</p>

"Hashem1983","2017-01-09T14:28:02.837Z","Better Than What You Expect","<p>I&#39;ve been wanting this set for so many times and I didn&#39;t have the chance until I found it on one of the online shopping with a good decent price.</p>

<p>The box of this set is on the medium size with the City Label on it and as usual the back displays the features of this set and it comes with 2 Instruction&nbsp;booklets.</p>

<p><strong>The Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Some or most of the parts are familiar like the normal bricks,&nbsp;slope pieces, plates, etc... but for me the most new parts I got in this set or to my parts collection, the front hood, &nbsp;the 6 studs wide windscreen, the trapdoor frame and the door, the canoe, the big front with the bow that is placed on top of the van, and finally the 1X8 plate with rail.</p>

<p>There are a total of 7 1X4 plates with the 2 knobs on the sides, 2 life jackets, 2 mugs and 2 oars and you get a spare oar. Regarding to the spare parts you only get 1 spare of each of the 1X1 round plate or cheese slope.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>There are 2 minifigures in this set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Male: brown hair with a smile on his face, wearing an orange sweater, there is also a print on his back that represents the hood, and he&#39;s also wearing a blue pants with no prints on it.</li>
	<li>Female: she has a nice interesting black hair piece, wearing a light blue blouse double printed on both sides, grey pants and also no printing on the pants.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these figures do not have double sided face, still they are decent looking figures.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was easy and straight forward, it took me around half an hour to complete it. You start with the bottom of the car, which I liked, it didn&#39;t need to use any specialized piece for its base, you build it from scratch, maybe that was the most interesting part on building this set as you go on top things gets a bit easier and quicker.<br />
My favorite part of the building was on the bottom and the inside of the camper, also adding the side mirrors near the windscreen was a very nice touch. The top of the van where you store the oars and the life jackets&nbsp;was the easiest part of the building.&nbsp;My only issue&nbsp;was with the stickers, there are so many stickers and the hardest ones are the small ones, I couldn&#39;t get them straight.</p>

<p><strong>The Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>I was surprised by the size of the van, it was bigger than what I was expecting, perhaps the build was on the easy or modest side but in the same time the whole van itself is quite sturdy, there are multiple features in this set, starting from the driving seat going back to the chair and coffee table to the bed on the back with a TV Screen on the side, two storage compartments on the top and just the back storage is spacious enough to store the oars, the life&nbsp;jackets and the spare pieces inside the compartment alone and you can keep it locked just with the canoe on top of the van, and let&#39;s not forget that the canoe is a playable feature and also the side of the van opens for easy access and the top part as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>This is a very beautiful set and a wonderful addition to your collection, I&#39;m not that much of a fan of vehicles but I loved this one, its simple, modern, unique, has a beautiful color scheme and above all its timeless.</p>

<p>I just had wish they added a small ladder in the back so it gives a feeling of climbing to the top of the van.</p>

<p>Its a great and a&nbsp;beautiful set, shame not to get it.</p>

"1x5Plate","2022-08-29T05:26:30.643Z","The Ideal Van For Any Camping Trip","<p>Back in 2014 when I purchased this set, I was fairly new to the LEGO community. Little did I know when I picked this set out at my local Walmart&nbsp;that it would become one of my favourite LEGO sets of all time. Why? Let me explain. Of all the camper van/trailer sets&nbsp;I own, (and I own quite a lot) I feel this set&nbsp;does it best. There is room for two minifigures in the front cab, something we don&#39;t get from every LEGO vehicle. There is also a bed and large TV in the back of the van, which looks extra cosy for minifigures. We can&#39;t forget the clever table build using window frame pieces as well. In the roof of the van there are storage compartments for life jackets and oars. These of course pair with the iconic red canoe, which is another major draw to this set. All of this&nbsp;is included for just $20 as well. I understand that prices are different now, but even in 2014 this set was a good value. I feel this set is much better than the more recent 60283 Holiday Camper Van (produced just last year). The only thing that set does better is include a trailer hitch. However, that&#39;s just a minor nitpick in the grand scheme of things. All in all, this set is just plain fun, both for the builder and the minifigures. I highly recommend it.</p>
