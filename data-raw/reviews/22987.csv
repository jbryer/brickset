"Harmonious_Building","2014-02-13T02:53:45.68Z","Ride the waves. ","<p>Can you improve on perfection? It&#39;s a philosophical question that is likely to remain unanswered until the end of time, but it seems as though LEGO is attempting to put forward evidence that the answer might just be a resounding &quot;YES&quot;. For our much more prosaic purposes, we may perhaps restate the question as follows: can LEGO keep making its vehicles better and better with each passing year? I would like to venture that the answer is the same, and the first piece of evidence that I submit would be this little gem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as innovation goes, LEGO City gets zero points. None at all. As much as Star Wars fanboys might like to claim otherwise, City is the true backbone of TLC, and the truth is that it has endured more or less intact throughout the company&#39;s various ups and downs. The company embraced a &quot;back to basics&quot; policy in the mid-2000s as it attempted to crawl out of dire financial crisis, and one of its core foci was the creation of a more modern and more realistic version for City for kids to sink their teeth into, and since then, we&#39;ve been treated time-and-time again to LEGO vehicles that just seem to get better and better.</p>

<p>One of my childhood favourites&nbsp;when growing up was Wave Rebel (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6663-1/Wave-Rebel"">6663</a>), and SUV and Watercraft immediately evoked memories of that gem (which is itself a testament to the longevity of even the most humble set). Even then, I remember being slightly annoyed that there was no proper place for the Octan driver to store his stuff. SUV and Watercraft takes everything that 6663 and supercharges it. Double the minifigs, double the watercraft, and I guess double the price as well - this is a serious upgrade over Team Octan&#39;s offering from over two decades ago, and it&#39;s completely worth it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>City sets rarely win points for minifigs either, though the two outdoorsmen in this set are cool enough that one really can&#39;t complain too much about them. The fact that the life vest design <em>still </em>does not allow for the minifigs to press their heads all the way down is a serious annoyance to me, especially considering that the design from, well, 1993 made this accomodation perfectly. I mean, why?&nbsp;</p>

<p>City vehicles tend to have an unsurprising penchant for being cheerful and brightly-coloured, but our titular SUV takes the controversial edgy road and comes in a sleek black instead, and it definitely does a great job at conveying a sense of &quot;toughness&quot; that its fellow banana-yellow cars don&#39;t quite have. There&#39;s plenty of room for two minifigs to sit without being overly bulky, and one particular detail that I love is a small ridge between the wheels that serve as a &quot;step&quot; for the minifigs to get inside. It&#39;s a thoughtful addition and one that should not go unappreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The adjoining trailer doesn&#39;t leave too much room for details, but the addition of a few (Octan-sponsored?) doodads goes a long way it making it that much more functional and playable. The two watercraft are identical in build and differ only in colour and stickers, and are both sufficiently sleek that they will easily fit into any coastal display. The boats pair very well with Surfer Rescue (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60011-1/Surfer-Rescue"">60111</a>), for instance (note that the boats in this set do bear differences compared to the one in the latter).</p>

<p>As far as small sets go, it&#39;s difficult to do much better than this. The display looks great aesthetically and there&#39;s a lot to play with, and there&#39;s not much more that one could ask for for US$20. Get this set and get impressed with City all over again.</p>

"Duq","2014-11-10T00:10:35.937Z","A pretty good City play set","<p>When I saw the first images of City 2014 this set stood out as an original and good-looking set. It is pretty much #4433 on water; a Land Rover based car, a trailer and two vehicles, one lime and one orange. In set 4433 they were dirt bikes, here they&#39;re jetski&#39;s.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a typical City-box; nice beach-scene on the front with all the elements from the set, one of the characters from the set shouting Hey! on the back along with some action-shots. The instructions come in two booklets. I&#39;m always amazed by how long instructions are nowadays. 80 pages for 219 pieces!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Bag one and book one build the car while bag and book two are for the trailer and the jetski&#39;s. Building is not difficult as you&#39;d expect from a City set. There&#39;s the usual bit of SNOT on the front and back of the car but it&#39;s all straight-forward. The jetski&#39;s are identical except for the colour and the stickers which lets down the building experience a bit.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>There are two minifigs in this sets. The first one is in jeans with a tank-top with a surfer print and a blue cap. His buddy is wearing a black wet-suit. Both have torso&#39;s printed on both sides and of course there&#39;s a life vest for each.</p>

<p>While the torso prints are new, the heads, cap and hair piece have all been used in dozens of sets before.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a few surprises in this sets parts selection. Curved slope element <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=47755"" target=""_blank"">47755</a> appears for the first time in white while 2x4 curved slope <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=93606"" target=""_blank"">93606</a> is new in lime and almost new in orange; the only other set with this piece in orange is a Chima polybag. It also has 4 of the still relatively new <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=11208"" target=""_blank"">small wheels with 6 spokes</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from those you get what you&#39;d expect from a City car; some grey plates for the car base, some brackets and grilles for the front and back of the car and trailer, some wheel arches and a windscreen or two. A big <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=30036"" target=""_blank"">wedge plate with grille</a> is used to good effect for the front of the trailer.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The jetski&#39;s look great. The curved pieces at the front work really well and the robot arm that holds the handle bars the perfect part for the job.</p>

<p>The trailer is a bit simple. There&#39;s no ramps or a winch to help the guys load up the jetski&#39;s and there&#39;s nowhere to store the life vests. What we do get is a petrol drum and a green 45 slope with a tap on top. No idea what it&#39;s meant to be. Compared to the trailer in #4433 this one is clearly lacking. That could be the result of the jetski&#39;s taking a bigger chunk out of the available part count than the dirt bikes. Interesting detail is the fact that the license plate on the trailer is not the same as on the car, suggesting that designers &#39;JM&#39; and &#39;DM&#39; worked together on this set.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also very wide. The trailer is 6 wide + the wheels. The jetski&#39;s on top make the total width 9 studs. That&#39;s a lot to fit into a City layout.</p>

<p>The car looks like a tough 4x4 which is what you need to tow a trailer onto a beach. It is clearly Range Rover inspired but with some Jeep dna mixed in. Strangely it doesn&#39;t have seats but instead uses part <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2432"" target=""_blank"">2432</a>, normally found in cockpits, to suggest seats. Maybe that&#39;s meant to make it easier to get the passenger in the back but that&#39;s still very tricky without taking the whole roof off.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For young builders this is a great set with a lot of play elements. For older builders it&#39;s got some issues like the lack of proper seats and the overly simple trailer.</p>

<p>Parts selection and value for money are solid but not spectacular, making it just a good City set, no more, no less.</p>
