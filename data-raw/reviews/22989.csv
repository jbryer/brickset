"legomaniac","2013-12-16T16:50:22.98Z","A carrier that is ready to deliver.","<p>Minifigures like their cars. Only way to get it to them fast enough is by car carrier. That is where this set comes in. Big yellow flatbed style truck with a trailer. Can hold up to four cars total. Two cars come with the set. One is blue and the other is red and black. Comes with a truck driver and a business man with a sleek hair do :) Im sure the business man is a car dealer and suitcase would be full of money :P.</p><p>The car from the 60017 set fits on the car carrier and is very similar to the 2 cars included in the car carrier set. <br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>New variety of city vehicle<br></li><li>Comes with two cars!<br></li><li>sleek business man if you dont have one like him already.</li><li>4x firetruck ladders!</li><li>Adds to a city play area or collection.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Empty space behind cab of truck. Could of included a tool box or something<br></li><li>The single axle setup on the truck and trailer look odd for the weight they would carry.<br></li></ul>
<p>In conclusion this is a fantastic set. it may seem expensive for $30, but I would price the two cars at $5 each, and the truck with trailer at $20. This would be perfect for a car lot MOC, or add more traffic to your city.<br></p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,4

<p>This set hits the mark on so many levels. First,&nbsp;let&#39;s look at the yellow cab. This cab is quite similar to those of current LEGO sets. This could be a plus for those hoping to MOC this out of the&nbsp;parts in their own collection as this means the build should be familiar to you. It also means that this model doesn&#39;t look out of place near a 2013 truck set.</p>

<p>Next, let&#39;s look at the carrier section of the model. This sub model is terrific and it functions to let you load and unload the cars! This feature is made out of mostly&nbsp;Technic parts so the building techniques used here might be new for System fans. The ladders used for the upper level ramps are fantastic and in light blay. The carrier is actually 2 sections that can be split to make a shorter trailer that only holds 2 cars. This also gives you the option to use left over parts to create another 2 car transporter.</p>

<p>The third section I&#39;d like to review are the cars being transported. These cars are&nbsp;fantastic little models. They are quite basic but do include side mirrors, a space behind the driver to store the included suitcase, the newer hood building method and of course there are two of them! One car has a red stripe/black color scheme while the other is solid blue. Seeing that the car transporter holds 4 cars this meant that I had to build 2 more cars using the instructions from this set to guide me. I made a red car and a dark red version of this car to be transported to a LEGO City near you.</p>

<p>The mini figures included are nice additions to any LEGO city. The truck driver has a nice torso, the new red ball cap and a clipboard (2x2 stickered tile). The other fig has a nice slicked back hair element, dark blue business suit and dark blue pants.</p>

<p>The completed model is worthy of any City layout, be it a large LUG layout or one in your house. I have purchased 1 and plan to purchase at least one more as the set is priced correctly when you consider you get a large truck, 2 small cars and 2 minifigs.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this set to any LEGO City fan and to anyone wanting to quickly build a newer styled City car or to someone wanting to learn how to build a car transporter.</p>

"Gerbil","2015-08-01T17:40:43.35Z","Fills your city streets out quickly and with style!","<p>I&#39;ve lamented the lack of more normal traffic sets for a long time. My city is full of emergency service vehicles, public services and more, but very few actual cars. This set brings two, along with a surprisingly accurate articulated trailer to transport them.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Decent play value. The seperate vehicles naturally are great, and the ramps that go up and down to allow the cars on and off work extremely well.</li>
	<li>Nice colour schemes on the cars.</li>
	<li>Who doesn&#39;t like seeing ladders used in a unique way?</li>
	<li>A clever little trick with the hooks to keep the cars up top safe and sound.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Call me greedy, but I&#39;d have killed for it to contain 4 cars!</li>
	<li>The sides of the cab are a bit strange with the SNOTs clearly visible.</li>
	<li>I feel like there&#39;s space to make the cab tiltable to access the engine. I feel a MOD coming on :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>Play value is great, there&#39;s always plenty of variety possible in these multi-model sets.<br />
If like me you wanted them to decorate your city with more traditional traffic, then it is a god-send, but also left me wishing it came with the full complement of cars. It looks awesome when fully loaded! But therein lies another problem - the original idea was to buy it just for the cars to put in the streets, but it looks so good I&#39;ve actually ended up with less - they are all loaded up and ready for transport now! I would definitely recommend buying 2 or more of these just to load up on cars, and if you have plans to build a car showroom, this is essential!</p>
