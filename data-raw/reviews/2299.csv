Very easy to snap the band, at the time I got it, it was the only Hagrids Hut to choose from. It has Hagrid, Dumbledore and the dragon Norbert. Cleaver design in the way the hut opens all the way up to play with it. Like the fireplace and its features. A great Harry Potter set with the exception of the roof, but the redid it later and fixed that problem.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2007-08-08T00:08:06.13Z","Strange roof","Santa gave me this when I was starting to collect Lego. The hut itself is awsome and I love the way it opens up to let You play inside. The fireplace can be spinned around to reveal Norbert (Hagrids dragon) Which I think is a custom piece.It also has a small table  which cups and jars. Plus a place to hid a book on dragons for Hagrid. It also includs a little cart and a trap to catch a rat. The only majoir problem is the roof is paper ad I could never get it to close properly. Still this pretty good set even for pieces astheres lots of grey green ,and brown pieces not too mention the usefull minifigs. 4/5 very good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Set includes the unique Norberta dragon, and a butter-pecan colored owl (I just ate ice cream =]). Also includes rare Dumbledore and Hagrid minifigs, and scabbers the [GRAY] rat. Also, the roof is expertly designed and the green shingles are a great bonus feature. The cage is ok too, I guess, and there is a key and lantern, which are hard-to-find elements as well. Awesome! The inside opens up so you can play with it, really good features in there, and closes for display. Spectacular addition to any Hogwarts collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-25T04:31:38.87Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Hagrid's Hut Review","I got this set for Christmas a long time ago. I really can't complain about the playabilities and the minifigs. We get Albus Dumbledore and Hagrid in this set. We also get Hagrid's dragon Norbert. You don't have to worry about stickers as well. The built of this set is fun and the hut is very sturdy. We also get a cage for a rat and a wagon.<br><br>The hut of Hagrid is very cool. The door does open very easily and the ceiling can be opened very well. The whole ceiling is a big piece which is made of some kind of cardboard material and it's attached to a rubber band after you built that model. The inside has some cool stuff like a keg with some tools in it, a table with bottles and an owl, a secret place where Hagrid can put a book about dragons and a chimney which sviwels. On the one side you can see the dragon and on the other side you can see a flame piece. It's a fun set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"ledaKat","2009-10-19T01:28:53.013Z","Magical Hut","I absolutely love this set!!

It is so magical how it opens as a great playset then completely closes up into Hagrid's cosy little hut he calls home. It has wonderful enchanting elements like the hidden book of dragons on the wall and the keys on the mantlepiece, just imagine what strange and facinating things they open. Also I love how you turn the chimney to hide Norbert the dragon from the view of untrustworthy visitors who come knocking on Hagrid's door.

I was unsure before I bought it if I would like the vinyl roof, wasn't too keen on it to be honest. Didn't know how it attached or even how it would stand up to gravity. But in building it I found it to be just fine. Looks really good with the overall design and stands very sturdy.

I would have liked to see Hagrid's pink umbrella and to be honest I think Dumbledore is a little unessesary... he is in other sets and I think if this set had to have a second minifig then they should have made Fang.

Pros:
Huge playability
Norbert
""Magical"" features
Authentic movie colour scheme and design
Great size
Lots of accessories

Cons:
Where is Fang?!
Front door needs a step... Hagrid might trip

Basicly, if you are a Harry Potter fan, more importantly if you are a LEGO Harry Potter fan then this set is a MUST HAVE.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-07T12:54:08.877Z","Hagrid's First Home is Roofless","<p>Set #4704 Hagrid's Hut: This set is one that features an interesting and unique albeit repetitive build for the main model. Hagrid's Hut is built up in sections that are all pretty much uniform/identical to one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exceptions being the section with the rotating fireplace and the front door section. There is also one sore point about this model that mars an otherwise perfect set. Years previously I had a set called Majisto's Magical Workshop, this set used some slanted specialty pieces to build up the roof, which really impressed me even back then, but when I finally finished Hagrid's Hut and had to put the roof on I was sorely dissapointed. This set has got to have the single worst element ever, a cardboard paper roof that links the set and keeps it closed using an elastic rubber band.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That in itself wouldn't be so bad if not for one important fact, cardboard tends to bend out of shape when shoved into a large ziplock freezer bag for storage. Also due to this Hagrid's Hut without the roof is not solid or fully locked together when you want to display it closed instead of open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a poor design choice, especially when LEGO had some years earlier introduced those slanted roof pieces to build plate roofs for Majisto's Magical Workshop. But I'm sure this set's roof situation could be improved upon with a bit of clever thinking and many spare pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set featured Hagrid, Professor Dumbledore, the baby dragon piece introduced with this Theme, an owl, a rat and a few accessories that were unique to this set. The gold chromed keys with Hagrid's Hut had a different tint to them making them look older and more weather worn, if that makes sense. Secondary Models included a tiny Rat Trapper and a small wheelbarrow/cart with a lantern. Hagrid also used the axe, which was a new piece either introduced with the Gammorrean Guard from LEGO Star Wars or this set, I'm pretty sure it was this set that introduced this unique accessory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, in spite of the flawed roof decision on LEGO's part, this set is still worth owning, for the many unique pieces, the two hard to come by Mini-Figures (for those of us who couldn't afford Hogwarts Castle.) and the great potential for improvements that the absence of a true roof meant for this set. I'd still reccommend it to HP LEGO enthusiasts even if they are a little bit turned off by that cardboard roof.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
