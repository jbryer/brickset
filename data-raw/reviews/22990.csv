"alexfig8","2013-12-30T14:06:54.687Z","A BEAST of a truck!","<p>Wow. &nbsp;This set is HUGE. &nbsp;30 studs long and 8 studs wide. &nbsp;It also has a great Price-Per-Piece ratio at under 10 cents/piece. &nbsp;What&#39;s not to like? &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>The box is about the same size as the Car Transporter box and shows the set very well on the front. &nbsp;The instructions are easy to follow. &nbsp;</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>Pretty good parts selection. &nbsp;Parts of interest include the large flame re-colored as water, the jet engine, the hose, trans-blue 1x1 bricks, a yellow crate, and other miscellaneous parts.</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p>2 minifigs, a woman and man. &nbsp;Both have the dark red fire helmets and torsos/pants from last year. &nbsp;They still look as good as they did last year!</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>Took me about 30 minutes. &nbsp;Nothing too amazing about it.</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>I really like this truck. &nbsp;It has some very unique but realistic details. &nbsp;My ONLY complaint, is the color. &nbsp;I think is should be a lime green instead, as most American &nbsp;airport fire trucks are lime. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know about European airport fire trucks, but even if they are red, they could release different color versions(This was done in 2005, when 7245 was released in some countries with black police stickers and in others with green police stickers) &nbsp;The cab seats 2, and has a control panel in the middle, most likely as an alternate way to control the water cannon. &nbsp;Behind the cab are 2 flip up panels, which store a yellow crate containing the usual fire gear. &nbsp;Up on the food behind that is a steering wheel for the water cannon and a hose on the side. &nbsp;At the back are 2 flip up panes on each side, which when opened, reveal an engine! The engine doesn&#39;t look fast, but it looks like something that would drive a huge truck like this! &nbsp;On the very back is an axe and saw clipped into the truck, and one of the many light bars around the truck</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>A REALLY great set. &nbsp;Again, my only flaw is the color, but it isn&#39;t THAT big of a deal. You should buy this set!</p>

"helo_one","2014-01-11T05:48:16.86Z","Formidable ARFF vehicle","<p>When I saw this set for the first time, when the first &nbsp;pictures came up, I immediatly concluded that I would buy this set. I am a enthousiast of Fire Fighting vehicles and this set looked great. I own more ARFF vehicles made out of Lego (Sets 7891,6440,6614) but this one resembles the real&nbsp; thing the most.</p><p>The box is large and contains three numbert bags and two booklets and yes, a sticker sheet. I didn't find any new parts (but I could be mistaken). The reserve parts consist of a some extra blue lights a red dot but also an extra hose, to my suprise. The build itself is straight forward and not to difficult. and bag 1 and 2 are described in booklet 1 and bag 3 in booklet 2.</p><p>The minifigs consist of two firefighters (man and female) There well printed at the front and the back but to my knowlidge not unike. It is a shame they still wear old style helmets (the same as in 1970 but in a different color) and it would have been nice when the TLC would make some new molds for new helmets as the are used in Europe. </p><p>The truck itself is HUGE....when placed besides set 7893 the plane doesn't dwarf the truck (as it would with set 7891) If placed besides set 6368 the truck is bigger and dwarfs the plane.</p><p>TLC looked really good to the real world and this truck has the most features the real trucks have. A groundhose, rescue equipment, breathing apparatus&nbsp; a cabin with controls to work with the roofmonitor. opening engine bay and what I like most , there is an engine in the back, it could have been bigger but it is a nice detail.</p><p>This set is a great buy if you like rescue vehicles ...the price is good for this set...but</p><p>there are some minor errors. The hose leaves a gap and behind the driver seat there is a huge open space. also the roofmonitor is not to my liking (to much colour) and I don't like the stickers (I didn't put them on&nbsp; and still the set looks great) And there's to much yellow bricks at the sides of the truck) also missing is the bumper nozzle</p><p>You can change that if you like (I did, I changed the rear yellow grille plates for black or dark grey ones, the front&nbsp;yellow grill plates are changed to a&nbsp;normal&nbsp; 1x4 red brick.&nbsp;The roof monitor is all black now) </p><p><br></p><p>As I said.... A GREAT set, HUGE , resembles the real world , so if you have an airport but no fire fighting vehicles.... this set has to be yours</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>",TRUE,5,4,3,4,5

<p>I enjoyed building this model a lot, but it was rather easy too, seeing as this set is intended for ages 5-12. Nevertheless, I enjoyed building it all the same. There is a little repetition, however, due to the quantities of the curved red bricks seen below.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I enjoyed the jet engine component included in the model (which the airport fire truck is supposed to put out).</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>The whole topic of this review is the secret compartment. This model has a little compartment using the red slope bricks seen above to conceal it. This compartment is used to hold the 3x4 box that contains equipment. This is my overall favorite part of the set, and even better, the compartment can conceal the water hose at the top of the model. I love sets that enable you to pack all the features up for modular purposes.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The firefighter minifigures in this model were the same as most, with one of them having the option to put a mask on (contained in the 3x4 equipment box). The female minifigure is only included in this set.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I enjoy this set, and it is very fun to play with, build with, and use as a display model.</p>

"jonnytheagent","2019-08-09T12:58:14.097Z","This set was an important step to airport fire brigade","<p>Here is my review of the set:</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The parts are very cool, like the flame parts in trans-light blue</li>
	<li>I think it is the first airport fire truck</li>
	<li>It is good that both minifigs&nbsp;fit in the truck</li>
	<li>There are enough tools like the axe or the chainsaw&nbsp;</li>
	<li>With&nbsp;the other tools, the truck fits also in a normal city fire brigade</li>
	<li>A female firefighter</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>There is only equipment for one firefighter, not for two, tough there are two included.</li>
	<li>The four flaps at the back of the truck are quite unnecessary</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, this is a pretty good set and belongs to every major airport.</p>

<p>I would like more airport fire brigade.</p>
