As this review's title indicates, this is a great set to add on to (or even start) a City collection. It's very similar to the High Speed Chase, just a little smaller.</p><p>Pros</p>
<ul><li>Motorcycles: This comes with 2 and both are well done. They each have a kickstand and balance well on flat surfaces. The minifigures also attached solidly.</li><li>Police Car: A small car with very little spare room for storage, but it has a nicely designed front and rear end that look fairly realistic.</li><li>Minifigures: The policeman is a nice addition to any existing group of policemen/women. The two robbers are the best, especially because one is female which seems rare. Also, the bag that fits onto the male robber can carry two ""money"" tiles securely.</li><li>Price: I got this for $20 which I thought was perfectly fair.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Stickers: The police car comes with several stickers and I sometimes think those are annoying. I'd like to see more printed pieces.</li><li>Police Car: It would be nice to have more storage space in the car for additional police gear.</li><li>Street Scene: This comes with a little ""scene"" with a random stack of bricks, fire hydrant, and garbage can. I can understand why this was added, but I think it could have been better executed or more detail work could be done with the car instead.</li></ul><div>All in all, I really like this set. It was everything I expected it to be - small, basic, but fun - and made a great addition to my City.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There's just over a hundred parts in this set. Some of the usual suspects for building a City car but there are also some interesting parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's a 2x2 curved slope (the bonnet) that's new this year. The rest of the bonnet is formed by last years cut-out wedge part, here for the first time in white.</p>

<p>The motorbike frame appears for the first time another colour than black; flat-silver. The motocross body appears for the first time in black and for only the second time in red. The spoked&nbsp;wheels come in pearl gold for the first time.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three minifigures in this set; two bad guys and a policeman. The robbers have the same legs and torso but different faces. Interestingly one of them is a girl. They don't wear helmets on their motorbikes (very irresponsible! Setting a bad example Lego ;-) which gives the set an American feel.</p>

<p>That American vibe is supported by the very American looking hat that the policeman wears. Other than the confused look on his face there's not much to say about him.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It's a very easy build. The bit of scenery is made of about 20 pieces and takes seconds to put together. The structure of the car follows the familiar City template with the front and back built sideways.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The bikes look nice in their new colours. The little ramp is great for play value as the bikes can jump over it. The 5 parts that make up the fire hydrant are a nice touch.</p>

<p>The star of the show though is the Police cruiser. It's a nice design, using some new pieces to shape the front. My only issue is that there's no room in the back for an arrested robber.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a pretty good small City set. For only â‚¬16 you get 3 characters and 3 vehicles and a bit of street-dressing. The biggest of the vehicles is a well-designed police cruiser. Once the officer has captured the bikers he'll need his colleagues from set 60043 Prisoner transport to get them to jail.</p>

"Turtlemoht","2015-10-21T06:20:59.263Z","A fun set with some questions to answer","<p>Like many AFOLs, I&#39;m a sucker for small sets that look like fun. That&#39;s how this set ended up in my collection.</p>

<p>Bikes, cops and those little cash 1 by 2 plates all draw me in.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This box is a little oversized, given that it only contains 110 pieces. Nevertheless, its&nbsp;short, wide shape lends its self to the action scene the set depicts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s where I think this set needs to answer a few questions.</p>

<p>There is value here as the bikes that&nbsp;are included are substantial, and you also get a&nbsp;nice mix of white with trans blue, orange and red for the police car. However, the bikes themselves are almost un-LEGOlike because they don&#39;t have any studs. They look great but there&#39;s almost no possibility of adding accessories or building out either bike and this is a real shame. In coming to this conclusion, I&#39;m reminded of the bikes I&#39;ve encountered recently, specifically those that are included in the&nbsp;<a href=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/76032-1.jpg?201502271018"">Quinjet City Chase</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/6858-1.jpg?201111200207"">Catwoman Catcycle City Chase</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/76017-1.jpg?201312140257"">Avengers: Captain America vs. Hydra</a>. Each of these bikes&nbsp;look cool,&nbsp;as do the&nbsp;dirt bikes that are included with this set&nbsp;(Catwoman&#39;s&nbsp;is a little large), but they all have at least one stud so that you can clip on the Captain&#39;s shield, an extra figure, a bag or whatever you can think of. This flexibility isn&#39;t present in the (cool looking) bikes included with this set and that&#39;s a bit of a shame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prove how inconsistent my opinions can be, somehow I&#39;m not a fan of the inclusion of two highly specific pieces in the construction of the police car (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6092654"">6092654</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6019163"">6019163</a>). I need to think more about other creative ways to use them, but on the surface they strike me as highly specialized 4 stud wide &#39;car&#39; pieces. The finished design they contribute to is cool (more on that below) but I&#39;m left feeling like a similar car could have been built using less specialized parts and more interesting techniques.</p>

<p>Lastly, it irritates me when you get rubbish bins in sets without a matching lid. Who are these LEGO city people? Philistines?&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the extent of my ranting. In reality, bikes are always fun and you get two in one set, which is nice. The come with pearl gold rims which is cool if you&#39;re into that and the little ramp that you build includes some masonry bricks which look very nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Being an 80&#39;s kid, I&#39;ve always loved LEGO&#39;s more naughty characters. Remember 1989 when all the pirates appeared with crazy mustaches and eye-patches? They were so much cooler than the clean-shaven standard LEGO face soldiers, right?</p>

<p>I still take this approach today. LEGO criminals always have a charm about them and that includes the two that are included&nbsp;in this set. The biker lady is the weaker of the two with a fairly standard expression (one side only) and the nice brown hair piece I think of as &#39;standard big-wavey-lady-hair. The biker bloke has great bristly sideburns, a skull cap and a concentration mono-brow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both the bikers have identical bodies: standard grey legs (un-printed) and a leather jacket&nbsp;over classic goon-striped tops.</p>

<p>As much as I like the crooks of the LEGO world, I&#39;ve always found the good guys to be a little on the bland side. That&#39;s thankfully not the case with the one policeman that is included here. On the other hand, they&#39;ve replaced bland with straight creepy, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The cop has the classic &#39;international&#39; cop look about him but the addition of mirrored shades and a blankly unhappy expression give me the impression that this is not a good cop. More on this in my conclusion.</p>

<p>All up, these figures are fun, though unremarkable.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for this set is very straight-forward. The street scene/ramp is simply a series of blocks and wedges on a plate and the police car uses a range of common &#39;car&#39; pieces. There&#39;s some interesting building going on in the front and back but at 110 pieces there&#39;s not much to crow about.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The key thing I look for in smaller sets like this is playability. How does the set go in terms of providing something you can play with by its self?</p>

<p>This set fulfills this extremely well. The two bikes, ramp, and police car give you a great little action scene. It may not be an interesting build, but this is a great set to have on your desk or in your bag for emergencies.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In writing this review I&#39;ve pointed out some tricky flaws, but hopefully also highlighted the areas that this set gets right. This is a good set and, given it&#39;s low price point, great value.</p>

<p>There is one real missed opportunity here, though. This set could easily be used to re-enact some of the cooler chase sequences from <a href=""http://www.fanpop.com/images/polls/19254_3_full.jpg"">Terminator 2</a>... If only there was an extra stud on the back of the bikes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m calling it now;&nbsp;switch the cop from this set&#39;s hat for <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6055554"">Bad Cop</a>&#39;s and you have a T1000.</p>
