<p>I bought this set while on sale in Canada. The Canadian&nbsp;retail price is $29.99. I was pretty excited about it when I first saw the initial images. Unfortunately I was disappointed after building&nbsp;it as I thought it needed some improvements.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set does offer some unique pieces.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The chain with ball</li>
	<li>the front windshield&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Light grey fences</li>
	<li>the new style hook</li>
	<li>dark grey window panels</li>
	<li>new upper/lower hinge elements&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>I thought the selection of parts were useful and interesting should one wish to use them to create another police vehicle. The white windshield piece would be very useful for train enthusiasts who want a different coloured locomotive, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I love the mini-figures in this set. The bodies are new for 2014. Both criminals are unique and the ball and chain is a nice touch from an old cliche.&nbsp;The cop comes with the new style hat. One definitely sees how this is a &#39;cops and robbers&#39; themed set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build did not take too long about 20 minutes. In fact the build is what I took issue with. The build is more about looks than having a solid playable design.&nbsp;There is a difficult balance between price point and the amount of parts used when making a business case for a Lego&nbsp;set. I felt that this set suffers from such a balancing issue.</p>

<p>The placement of the 1x4 wall elements creates a unnecessary gap between it and the window panels inside. It really defeats the purpose of having the panels and to keep a prisoner secure. They used a 1x3 brick to position the grey bars in the centre of the back half of the van. This however should have been moved in front of the 1x4 wall element to close the gap. It doesn&#39;t create any issues with the functionality of the break away bars. The other build issue that drove me nuts is the interior of the prisoner compartment. The designer did not cover the gaps between the chassis and the wheels. These horrible gaps really detract when placing the mini figure in the back.</p>

<p>The roof opening however is structured nicely in order to place the mini figures in the back. This includes the way the designer used the double plates for the ceiling over the driver. It&#39;s easily removed to place the driver inside. I&#39;m not sure why the designer chose to use a sloped dome piece to secure the key next to the driver. I thought that took away needed space for a second seat. The other little detail I noticed was that they did not use a mug on a dashboard like in most other &#39;Great vehicles&#39;.</p>

<p>Technically one could have employed 1x3&nbsp;doors instead of the 1x2 wall element but I felt that is more of a preference rather than a necessary feature. The side ladders are a nice touch to make realistic steps to the cabin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accompanying getaway vehicle I believe was designed as a two sweater however a clip for the crowbar would have been better. Note there is no place to place the crowbar.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once completed the set is realistic. There are stickers of course but in this set are necessary as printed pieces would have possibly pushed the price up.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall despite its shortcomings I like the set. However the main drawback with this set pertains to my comments above. Personally for the sake of an extra $1.60 (I calculated this based on an extra 13 parts using Pick a Brick prices) the gaps could have been closed off and a more secure looking prisoner transporter would emerge. Clearly this set was suffering from the price point versus part ratio in its business case.&nbsp;I would recommend this set but advise buying a few extra parts to modify it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The armoured truck looks really meaty; not something to be taken lightly.</li>
	<li>Not the most secure criminal transporter ever, with 3 means of escape (ignoring the door!).</li>
	<li>Plenty of play possibilities.</li>
	<li>Chains!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>I don&#39;t need any more of these silly 4x4 buggies.</li>
	<li>The key / door idea is nice, but fiddly in practice.</li>
	<li>The interior of the back of the truck is just plain ugly - uneven and with holes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>The build itself was nothing worth writing about (so I won&#39;t. Oh, I just did, oops!). The buggy is just your standard &#39;add another vehicle with the minimum piece count&#39; effort, although at least in this set it has a reason to exist, helping the prisoner to escape. I liked my first few but rapidly grew to detest them as they are far too prevelant, instead of properly fleshed out vehicles. At least the wheels will help with MOC cars... The truck looks great from the outside. A very solid and strong build, it is definitely an impressive addition to my city. The cab is also nice, with a key holder there for security. The back is horrible though. Uneven and with gaps, it just looks like the designer gave up at this point. Given how the prisoner has the ball and chain on his leg piece, despite the size of the cell there&#39;s only 1 place you can place him, sat down and pressed up against the door. However, this is to a certain degree nit-picking as the set offers some great playability, and the truck alone is a relatively unique and great-looking design.</p>

"koen_theys","2016-04-07T21:07:43.56Z","Gotta catch em all","<p>I got this set for my daughter. In my opinion a very good looking small set with a lot of playability. It is an addition to her sets <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60048-1/Police-Dog-Unit"">60047 - Police Dog Unit</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60042-1/High-Speed-Police-Chase"">60042-1 - High Speed Police Chase</a>.</p>

<p>We ... euhm&nbsp;... of course I mean she :), has with this set enough crooks and police so the next set will be an other theme of City.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Normal LEGO City Box. On the backside there are several images of playability.</p>

<p>There is 1 booklet.&nbsp;The instructions are very simple and the building progress is very basic, about 2 or 3 pieces per built. Ideal for young builders.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No special bricks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>- 2 Crooks</p>

<p>- 1 Police officer</p>

<p>- a few minifig tools such as a key, crowbar and an old style handcuffchain with a ball attached (super&nbsp;nice)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I said before, very simple building progress with about 2 to 3 pieces per built. For elder children the built is very simple but for new builders an ideal start.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><u>The Quad</u></p>

<p>Small and fun vehicle with one drawback, and that is that the chain with the hook is really long and therefore a bit troubleling when you are riding the Quad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chain is super&nbsp;fun to attach to the police truck. But you do need to get the hang of it otherwise the chain always drops before you can rip the prisoners rails out.</p>

<p><u>The police vehicle</u></p>

<p>It is huge! The styling (the front part of it) is very American and I like it. There can sit two crooks inside the jail part, however, when you stuff them tight, they can hold 4.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police officer has in his cabin, a small door he can open (and close) to get to the prisoner. The back of the truck has a prisoners door and the roof has also a hatch, however this is for access (playability) rather then a real function. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The color scheme is coherent with the other police vehicles of the series so all good points on that part. A small detail that I really like, is the steps for the police officer to get into the truck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Superb set with a lot of playability. Definitely combined with those two other sets we have (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60048-1/Police-Dog-Unit"">Police dog Unit</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60042-1/High-Speed-Police-Chase"">High Speed Police Chase</a>), laughter and action is guaranteed. This later, the High Speed Police Chase,&nbsp;has a hideout for the bandits so the cops can get a warrant and search the house. The dogs can help in the pursuit of the badass bandits.</p>

<p>1 set is good, 2 sets are better, 3 sets are KING!&nbsp;</p>

<p>1 point of critic, when you put the police vehicles of the 3 sets next to each other, I find that the scale of the vehicles are a bit off. The Prisoners Truck is supposed to be huge (and it really is), but compared with the police dog truck, it does not stand out. Perhaps the police dog truck is just a little to big, however I love that truck (old styling) and wouldn&#39;t want to change it a bit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We love it.</p>
