"mini_mads1980","2014-06-08T18:22:41.003Z","A very good remake","<p>This set has&nbsp;certainly improved on&nbsp;previous versions (7288 and 7743).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box has a great image of the set, featuring an escaping robber with the two police officers in the set&nbsp;giving chase.&nbsp; Both sides of the box have the same image, the bottom has the manufacturing information and the top shows all the three Minifigures, with the highest ranked police officer as the 1:1 scale image.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back of the box shows you how many sections the build is broken down into, with a list of four other police sets released at the same time of this set (60043, 60045, 60046 and 60047).&nbsp; There are also eight images of the set in action, showing some of the functionality.&nbsp; The same Minifigure as the 1:1 scale image is featured as the Hey! character at the top right hand side of the back of the box.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three instruction booklets.&nbsp; Book one constructs the lorry cab and has all three Minifigures.&nbsp; Book two and book three build the trailer element.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are not going to be too sought after, however there were a couple of pieces that were interesting.&nbsp; Part 6055313 was new to me, despite being in 32 sets!&nbsp; It is a smooth 2x2 round plate with a hole in the middle.&nbsp; It is a new part and features in only recent sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;The other new part was the police hat, which so far is only in the sets released in this wave of police sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get two police officers and a standard robber.&nbsp; Other than the new hat these won&#39;t be making people rush out to purchase.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite basic, exactly what you would expect for a 5-12 age range.&nbsp; i did like the front grill construction, but felt the transparent 2x1 plates made it too wide.&nbsp; Additionally the slide out walls, not too evident on the box pictures, are a nice touch.&nbsp; It did make we wonder why the space was not being used up to step 34 of the build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As I have said above, this is the best of the three versions of the Mobile Police Unit.&nbsp; The opening of the side of the trailer and the roof has been improved and the computer console is great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lorry cab is nothing special, but even this has been improved.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set.&nbsp; I only bought it as it was &pound;21 in a shop, so could not resist.&nbsp; It has plenty of playability and seems sturdy.</p>

"Sobel","2015-05-16T15:57:59.663Z","So many functions and... A COFFEE MACHINE!!!","<p>This was one of the few sets I bought brand new from EBay! It is always a great pleasure for me to hold an all new box of LEGOs in my hands and build with those shiny new bricks, which are all clean and sparkling and... oh, I got carried away! ;-)</p>

<p>Well, in more than 20 years of collecting, this was my first LEGO truck, I got! And I have to say, it is really great! Compared with what I saw from earlier Police observation vehicles, it has really improved a lot.<br />
The build takes a little time, but is not that difficult. There&#39;s a lot of functions in this set, and, what I find to be especially remarkable, so many details!! The interior of the trailer is nicely designed, with many monitors, maps, slide-in-charts and... A COFFEE MACHINE!!! I mean, how cool is that! Even this small thing is so nicely designed, that you can point out the part where the coffee beans/powder are/is filled in! I have never seen such a small but detailed little gimmick in a LEGO set!<br />
The set features a lot of gear for the three minifigures, that go with it. You get two flashlights, two pairs of handcuffs, a walkie-talkie, some shackles, a crowbar and loot for the crook and a pair of road blocks. All this stuff gives you a great playability!<br />
I also like the design of the truck better than the design of the older Police-Truck sets. It looks very massive and powerful!</p>

<p>There&#39;s one little thing, that could have been better: in the 2012 set 7288 there was a small car and a motorbike added. It would&#39;ve been great, if there was at least one extra vehicle with this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>What makes this set really great, in my opinion are the details! Many many monitors, charts, computers, the stylish coffee machine, the bully design of the truck, the abundance of extra gear... An easy build for a lot fun!!</p>

"Megalodon86","2014-11-08T21:38:27.417Z","Great set, cool lorry.","<p>So, my son is turning 4 in a couple of months, and i decided to get my old lego&#39;s&nbsp;out. I also bought of couple of new boxes, including this one.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice box art and clear instructions. Not much else to say about it i guess.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The smaller ones are a bit hard for my 3yo son, but with a little help he manages just fine. I don&#39;t think there are a lot of special or unique parts in this one, but i could be wrong; i&#39;ve&nbsp;not really read into the modern day lego (yet).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building it&nbsp;was a little slow because it was pretty much the first thing my 3yo built, but nonetheless great fun, he really understood the instructions and saw the lorry and command centre&nbsp;come to life. Playability is great too. He can be a bit harsh on the toys and this thing withstands quite a lot without breaking; very sturdy build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Lots of playability, the first thing he did was race to the mine and excavator transport, and switch lorries, switch minifigures etc. Also role playing and imaginative stuff. He was busy all day. As a bit of an AFOL, i liked the completed model a lot myself. What a difference with 6335, the Indy Transport! My biggest truck from &#39;back in the day&#39;.&nbsp;This model makes that thing look so old.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set, and at &euro;21 (incl. shipping), great value!</p>

"andyh1984","2016-08-18T19:16:18.953Z","More than just a police truck","<p>A&nbsp;good set on its own merit,&nbsp;and a nice way to get a command center if the police station is out of your range (either through price or lack of room)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A nice larger box which shows the details and play features of the set</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of blue pieces&nbsp;and white panels and a variety of stickers</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 policemen one with a stern face and the new style peaked police cap and one with a grin and a baseball cap both have same torso and legs their&nbsp;accessories are a torch/flashlight, walkie-talkie and handcuffs. 1 crook with stubble, knitted cap and striped shirt torso with dark grey legs his accessories are&nbsp;a crowbar, money and a ball and chain.</p>

<h3>The build&nbsp;</h3>

<p>you build the cab then the trailer which is not as repetitive as I expected.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks great, the cab is a modern flat front with high driving position and modern narrow lights,&nbsp;and the trailer opens to reveal a computer station and a cell and two sliding panels&nbsp;reveal a coffee machine and a gps map screen with real co-ordinates on it that bring up Legoland&nbsp;Denmark on Google Earth.&nbsp;<br />
There are stickers for some monitor screens, a map and wanted poster on the inner doors of the trailer ( a female criminal is on the wanted poster so maybe a female stripey topped crook in a future set would be a change) and the gps screen and police logos are stickers. 2 barriers are in a section at the front of the trailer with its own doors.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp;I love it, the cab with its modern &nbsp;&quot;beefy&quot; appearance with the innovative use of a railing piece for the bumper and the trailer with its sliding panels and ceiling mounted screens. Excellent.</p>

"LegoMoose","2017-11-27T16:47:11.89Z","LegoMoose's Mobile Police Unit","<p>This set is great. I actually went to two different stores to find this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a laid back set to build and is very playable. It looks very good with the doors closed and the interior is very nice. You get a couple of computer screens and a jail cell for those pesky criminals. On top, there are two things to slide, one will bring out a map on the inside, and the other will reveal a coffee machine on the inside. On the trailer there is another &#39;closet&#39; that opens up and in there you can store your police barricades. You can detach the truck from the trailer and under the trailer you can swing a little doo hickey out (I don&#39;t know how else to explain it.) and that allows the trailer to stand by itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure wise, you get two cops, one to drive the truck and the other to be inside the truck. There ARE two sets in the trailer so that both of your cops can sit inside. You also get a robber, however all he has is money and a crowbar.</p>

<p>This version of the mobile command center is probably the best version LEGO has ever made. It is pretty large, and unless you have a minifigure scale&nbsp;city, this will most likely look out of place in your city. The price is good for the pieces and the build experience is pretty nice. I am giving this set a <strong>4.8</strong> out of 5.0.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have a great day/evening and happy building!</p>
