It all comes together in a bright colourful package that showcases just how closely DK has become linked with quality LEGO Books.</p>
<p>The pages and design layout are all quite fun looking and exciting, younger readers will see a thrill every time they turn to a new subject, there's a lot of impressive work on the part of the MOCers as well. They show how to build great looking display elements, be they Micro Scaled builds, Minifigure compatible ones or even life-size items that can be used as interactive elements for those who like building and playing with their LEGO.</p>
<p>There are even small call-outs to certain pieces that are universally useful during build sessions, a few instances of challenges to see if you and your friends can build and play a short simple game using your LEGO bricks and other things pointing out particularly useful steps in learning how to build certain sections of a model.</p>
<p>This book is a great addition to anybody's LEGO DK Book collection, it's just as fun looking as 2011 LEGO Ideas book was and I believe done by pretty much the exact same creative team. Each chapter focuses on one builder and includes a little storyline to enjoy, because this could have been quite bland and technical if it wanted to be with full on breakdowns of each model showing exactly how to build the same thing, instead it offers up a great number of tips and tricks to try and make your own creations.</p>
<p>I'd recommend this book to any big fans of LEGO, it may not include any bonus Mini-Figures or anything of that sort, but it doesn't have to because this is a fun read. If I had any complaints it would be the dustjacket, the cut of the slipcover/dustjacket on this book doesn't match up very well with the actual curvature of the spine of the book. The top on my copy as soon as I unwrapped the thing from it's shrink wrapped protective cellophane started to warp and crease a bit as I proceeded to read through it. And this is a sharp type of paper that could easily cause papercuts if not careful.</p>
<p>Ironically this is the only DK book where the dustjacket doesn't mold to the book... Then again this is the only DK Book I own that actually has a dustjacket, perhaps it's something that can be worked on and corrected for the next book in the series, whichever/whatever that may turn out to be.</p>
<p>Strongly recommended.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,1,5
