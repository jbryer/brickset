"Stoltz_75","2014-01-25T11:55:10.003Z","Great value and allows creativity","<p>Lots of Lego for &pound;7.99 and I really like the A model. Nice&nbsp;possibilities to get creative afterwards too, making this a winning set that just keeps giving.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is small as you&#39;d expect, but it has a nice weight to it and you immediately feel like you are getting a good deal. There are two separate instruction manuals for two models. There&#39;s also a sheet of stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>There is a good selection of pieces in this set that includes four small wheels, six propeller blades, two blue panels, and a nice mix of beams, rods, cogs, and pins. The bright blue pieces are very attractive and blend really well with the grey and white colour scheme.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build is usual Lego, in so far as you wonder how they manage to put these models together in such an intricate manner. Both builds are fun, if not overly taxing. I&#39;d agree with recommended age of 7+</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The A model steals the show in terms of appearance and playability. The twin rotors work really well and they have a satisfying spin that will keep you busy for longer than perhaps they aught to. The helicopter also moves around on a surface as the front wheels can turn in any direction. I didn&#39;t apply the stickers, but I expect them to further enhance the A model. I will certainly be applying them once I&#39;ve finished playing around with this set.</p>

<p>The B model also looks good and it&#39;s a nice size too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&#39;ve bought four or five small to medium technic sets over the past year and this is probably my favourite. This is a great set to get creative with once you&#39;ve finished with the two builds. I would also recommend this as a good introductory set for potential Lego technic fans young or old. Once I&#39;ve finished being creative, I&#39;m going to rebuild the A model with my five year old son and I&#39;ve no doubt that he will get a decent amount of play out of it.</p>

"BungJon","2014-06-15T03:25:10.09Z","Fun set with great parts","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in the typical small box for a set this size. It includes printed instructions for both the A and B models.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set really shines in the parts area. It includes 6 of the new and rare propeller blades which were first introduced in the large 9396 helicopter in 2014, and the 9396 set only had 4 of them! Additionally, this set includes two blue 11 length lift arms, has two of the small blue panels, and two 11 length white lift arms, among a couple other great parts. Finally, it has a high parts count in addition to all of these great pieces. Simply put, this set is an excellent value!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for both the A and B models were easy and straightforward, but also very enjoyable. It was fun seeing the set come together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I must confess that I bought this set for it&#39;s parts. But I was unexpectedly surprised by how great both the A and B models look and how much fun they are to play. They don&#39;t have a lot of functions, which is to be expected for a set of this size. However, the lack of functions in no way hinders the wonderful playability of both the A and B models. The propeller blades spin smoothly, especially on the A model, and greatly enhance the joy of playing with this little helicopter. Also, it definitely has the &quot;swoosh&quot; factor and it will turn any adult into a kid :-).</p>

<p>My only complaint, and it&#39;s a minor one, is that the rear wheels on the A model look a little bit funny sticking out of the sides.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set.&nbsp;I think this is one of the best sets, if not the best, in it&#39;s size. It&#39;s fun to build and play. It&#39;s best feature is the price and parts. You get a lot of value for your money. I highly recommend this set.</p>

"aldredd","2014-06-21T14:10:12.647Z","Nice quick build","<p>I bought this set to hit a order value which meant I triggered a good promotion, otherwise I likely wouldn&#39;t have bothered. But, it&#39;s Lego technics, so I was always going to enjoy building it!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Pretty standard part set, as you can imagine. But, you get some electric blue beams &amp; panels, which you don&#39;t see often on a technics set, and the 6 rotor blades.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a simple build, which should take you no more than 30 minutes or so. Nothing fancy or complex, as you&#39;d expect.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a cute little model, but lacks in functionality. The rotors spin together via a knob at the back. The front wheels swivel &amp; the &#39;cargo bay door&#39; opens. But what do you want for &pound;8?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This would make a good set for anyone new to technic to understand what&#39;s involved before moving to something bigger. But, personally, I&#39;d recommend the Mini Backhoe 42004 if you can - &nbsp;it&#39;s a bit more (around &pound;15) but offers far more in return.</p>

"princeofgonville","2015-02-14T10:21:08.557Z","Great build, parts and play value","<p>I bought this set for the parts, but was very pleasantly surprised at the fun I had building it and playing with it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has a satisfying shape to it - small enough for a small gift, chunky enough to promise good play value. There are two instruction books - one for each model - and a sheet of stickers. The parts are shipped in two bags - one for small parts and one for larger parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set contains a nice collection of technic pins, beams, gears and axles. I enjoyed finding parts in this set that I haven&#39;t seen before (they are available in other sets: they are new to me). A few extra pins, bushes,&nbsp;a spare crown gear and a spare tyre are also provided, along with the additional parts required for the B model.&nbsp;&nbsp;?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I grew up on &quot;traditional technic&quot;, with studded beams. I am relatively new to the &quot;new technic&quot;, and built this model to discover techniques for construction with the new style of technic parts. There are no studs anywhere in this set: everything is held together (very solidly) by pins and axles. The build was relatively complex, and it would be very difficult to build this set without the instructions. However, the instructions were clear, and by following them properly, a satisfying build is achieved.&nbsp;De-construction was also quite a challenge because of the way the parts inter-connect.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set has far greater play value than I was expecting. The jockey-wheel at the front makes for great fun movement on the table/carpet. The rotors turn by means of a pin at the back, and the set begs for a &quot;thb-a-thb-a-thb-a-thb-a&quot; sound effect. For helicopter geeks, the two rotors turn correctly in opposite directions. With a bit of effort and re-assembly, the correct synchronization of the rotors can also be achieved.</p>

<p>The B model is less exciting (as one might expect), but still offers a fun build and good play value. However the main model is the star of the show here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is an excellent small model as an introduction to Technic&nbsp;build techniques <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">for the younger builder. It&nbsp;</span>rewards the builder with great play value, and the parts offer great flexibility for other things one might want to build. I might get another one for the parts.</p>

"AyCarrumba","2015-06-24T17:36:53.717Z","A lovely little twin rotor helicopter","<p>I bought this as another little trinket alongside bigger sets, really just because it looked fun and the rotor/propellor parts are neat.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard small tear open box but includes both sets of printed instructions. The B model looks just as good, a single rotor helicopter.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I love the less is more ethos of these mini lego sets. Two rotors and 4 wheels and some beams and axles. A decent parts haul for &pound;7. You can use them to make a single or twin engined larger propeller plane, or a hovercraft MOC for example which is rare in itself.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None. Again.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a quick build with a couple of tricky parts but nothing unusual.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What a fantastic little model for the money!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m really happy with this pocket money set. My 3 year old son loves it too. The rotors work well and spin with nice hefty momentum, and the bogey front wheel makes it surprisingly fun to manouver on smooth ground. The opening cargo door is a nice detail touch, as are the clear &#39;lights&#39; or &#39;windows&#39; underneath the cockpit.</p>
