<p><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">This set has been on my wish list since I first heard of it&#39;s release. I was finally able to acquire it just a few days ago, and I&#39;m very satisfied with my purchase.</span></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">This set excels in the area of parts! This set includes several new suspension pieces, a beam that&#39;s shaped like a dog bone, and a new three length pin that has an axle on one end (it&#39;s like the blue pin with axle except the pin side is twice as long). It&#39;s quite rare to have so many new parts in such a small set! The set also includes three right and three left side new style small panels in black.</span> The set is lacking in the area of gears as there are only four gears which are used as wheels for the tread.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The set is easy and enjoyable to build. There are some creative build techniques employed in this model, especially to form the unique profile of the snowmobile.</span></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The completed model looks very good. </span><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The shape of the snowmobile is very well done by using beams placed at a variety of angles, rather than just the typical 90 or 180 degree angles. Also, the model has a very nice color scheme and includes a variety of rare lime green beams (e.g. two 13 length lime green beams).</span></p>

<p><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">The model has limited playability overall, but decent considering it&#39;s small size and limited number of parts.</span><span class=""BVRRReviewText""> It would be very difficult to add more functions without increasing the size or price. Nonetheless, there are just a few functions, but those few functions were implemented very well.</span></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><span class=""BVRRReviewText"">I do recommend this model. It&#39;s fun to build, has a great selection of parts, and is a good value for your money.</span></p>

"boneskull","2014-08-31T06:39:49.57Z","What The Hell Is A Snow Motorcycle","<p>I got this because I wanted a cheap Technic set. &nbsp;These are always good for a lot of pieces and multiple builds. &nbsp;It was either this or another &quot;pull-back&quot; car, and one is enough of those.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions were fair. &nbsp;A lot of flipping and twisting around though, which is something I&#39;ve seen since coming out of my dark age. &nbsp;Not a big fan of that.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Several parts I&#39;ve never seen before in this one, including the dark stone T-shaped ball-joint things and the special beams that connect to them. &nbsp;Nice to have some of these beams in lime.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The free-spinning gears (which connect to pins, not axles)&nbsp;which the tracks ride are new to me. &nbsp;I&#39;m wondering what else they could be used for since they can&#39;t really drive anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tracked sets are always cool, but ...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set came with several invisible&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;that told me to yell obscenities.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Link treads, of course, are tedious</span>. &nbsp;There are 41 of them in the main model. &nbsp;This isn&#39;t too bad, but they are little, so tough to even grab let alone snap together. &nbsp;And this is coming from someone who had&nbsp;about 440 old-style black chainlinks, which are mostly just vacuum fodder. &nbsp;I have been spoiled by the larger treads on the new&nbsp;Excavator and Bulldozer.</p>

<p>I like the use of the shock absorbers and how the skis connect to the steering column. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t usually complain about stickers, but yeah, stickers. &nbsp;I don&#39;t see the point here.</p>

<p>This was an &quot;above average&quot; build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When I think &quot;snowmobile&quot;, I think something more akin to&nbsp;8272-1, where the treads are closer to the body. &nbsp;It looks to me like the rear of&nbsp;this could be more compact and stout. &nbsp;That being said, it looks decent, and is a pretty good size for a $20 set. &nbsp;It&#39;s pretty much average.</p>

<p>Plastic treads will have a tough time moving on smooth surfaces. &nbsp;I wish they&#39;d find a compromise between the single-piece rubber treads and these link ones. &nbsp;I&#39;m thinking plastic links which clip, then the tread part is rubber and fits snugly on them somehow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The alternate model, though. &nbsp;I put this together and am wondering what this even is. &nbsp;It&#39;s supposed to be a &quot;snow motorcycle&quot;, which doesn&#39;t exist despite what Google says. &nbsp;I Googled it because I had no idea. &nbsp;The doctored photos look similar to what LEGO claims a &quot;snow motorcycle&quot; is, so I&#39;ll give them points for effort. &nbsp;But aren&#39;t motorcycles dangerous enough without you riding them in the snow? &nbsp;Get a brain. &nbsp;Think about the children!</p>

<p>The &quot;snow motorcycle&quot; is tall, very tippy, and awkward. &nbsp;It looks like someone had a bad&nbsp;idea, but didn&#39;t have the parts, so made a rough approximation of that idea, and since they never fully realized the idea, they were not able to fully realize the idea was bad in the first place. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of the results of alternate builds for Creator and Technic sets are fair-to-good. &nbsp;This is probably the poorest I&#39;ve seen, which reduces the value of the set for me.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The assembled&nbsp;Snowmobile is, again, average, though the build was above average. &nbsp;The alternate is laughably poor. &nbsp;There are stickers. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t too expensive.</p>

<p>I am usually very happy with Technic sets, which offer a lot of value.&nbsp; If I could be born again and live 34 years up to the point where I read this review I wrote (from the future), I would not buy this set. &nbsp;If I didn&#39;t read this review (from the future) I would probably buy the damn thing and&nbsp;write this review again.</p>

"coloagnt1","2015-03-13T04:30:05.113Z","So-So","<p>The box and instructions are typical Lego fare for sets at the $19.99 price level and lower. &nbsp;Glued closed at both ends as opposed to clear tape. &nbsp;There is no minifigure with this model which is usually the case with the Technic product line. &nbsp;The build was pretty entertaining for a set that&#39;s about 150 pieces (41 being the &quot;belt&quot; piece #6047885).</p>

<p>My biggest complaint about this model is the picture on the front is a bit deceptive. &nbsp;If you are looking for the lime-green technics pieces you are going to be disappointed as there are only eight&nbsp;actual pieces in this color. &nbsp;The sticker sheet size, in relation to the piece count&nbsp;is absurd. &nbsp;You actually receive 2 more (10) stickers with the lime-green hue than you do actual pieces(8). &nbsp;</p>

<p>As previous reviewers stated, there do appear to be some new, cool technics pieces which continue to advance and make the mechanics of the Technics line much more smooth and realistic!!</p>

<p>The overall model once completed, is meh, not that impressive. &nbsp;I happened to pick up a box at Target at $13.98. &nbsp;For that price, I&#39;d do it again... not at full price of $19.99 however.</p>
