After going through all the pains of adolescence, I reawakened from my 'dark age' after discovering this most-American looking of train sets. It was fun to build, the directions were easy to follow, and the finished model looks great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-14T08:02:55Z","Best train to date","Got this set just a few days ago (Too bad I missed out on the numbered 'collectors edition') The locomotive goes together like a charm. It's a little top-heavy, and don't it too fast around those curves!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-16T10:28:25Z","Lego's Best Train Engine","In careful review of this set to remain unbiased toward Lego trains (some of my favorite sets), I would rate this set an overall 9.9. First, I would rate the model a 10 in replication to a real Super Chief engine. The set is built using advanced building techniques adding to the overall realism. It takes a while to build and having to build some of the sections (under carriage and front end) separately indicates that designing this set must have taken much time and creativity. For playability, another 10! The set is in scale to regular minifigs (although larger than other train engines) and has a seat for the driver and a rear area for the engineer (plus includes a gauge on the engine and tools adding to overall playability level). A lift able top makes the set easy to access for placing the figures.

"A_Brickset_user","2003-12-14T06:43:42Z","A nice train!","As a longtime train fan, this set looks great and is a fine replica with good details. It's a fun build and once finished, highly enjoyable. However, the downsides are all the custom bricks, the use of stickers, and there's a compatibility problem; it's larger than normal Lego train sets. 

Overall an enjoyable set. As a numbered limited edition set it rates a 10, but as a regular train set, the Santa Fe Super Chief rates an 8.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T00:28:58Z","Nice details","This is a nice looking train and if you include the other cars, it is just awesome. Good details and nice use of stickers. The only drawback is that this is much larger than other trains and barely fits into my train shed. A compatibility issue. 

Overall a good set. 8/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-03T17:19:14Z","Got it...","I couldn't wait to get this set... BOX: 10/10 - The box picture clearly shows the set and all of the content. It would have been better if they showed a better picture of the interior... PIECES: 9/10 - Has old piece in new colors. The coupler is now in grey! And so is the wheel! I don't know why, but the sticker always fall off. And that the roof doesn't have any piece to hold it in place.. PLAYABILITY: 9/10 - Loses 1 point for oversized train. But maybe that was the only way to make it look accurate. OVERALL: 10/10 - Great set and great pieces. Must-have. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-11T02:25:16Z","Brings back memories","I would never have bought this train if it weren't for my memories of seeing trains similar to this during my trip in the US, otherwise I would have rated this set a 6 as it looks very odd compared to trains in the UK.  

On the plus side, this set has lots of pieces, it's nicely coloured, and I think it's a great collector's item. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-09T15:46:58Z","Great Locomotive","I just bought this set at my visit to Legoland G&#252;nzburg.
It's the greatest Engine I've seen in years. The removable roof gives a look to that big diesel engine in it. There are a hammer and a kind of crusher in the back of the train. 
The model is really nice detailed and has over 400pcs which is much in the rather small box. Another nice fact are some SNOT and the extra pieces for motorizing it. The only thing missing is a kind of those older light pieces from the 80s and a motor. But that doesn't matter if you have one from the big train sets with trafo and so on.
Now to the minifigs. They've got classic grins, which were common in the town sets from 1993 to 1997. Well there's one minor mistake. It's very big compared to the other train sets, but it's a very realistic model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-24T08:28:14Z","Super","I have admired this set for a couple of years now, but convinced myself I could live without it. Fearing that it would soon be unobtainable, and I would then wish I had bought it, I decided to get it and the five cars before it was too late. It has pretty much all been said. It is a superb replica both in appearance and colours - love the diesel engine and generator inside which can be seen through the round window in the body side. It looks great just displayed sitting on a length of track, but I have motorised mine and that is where my only criticism comes. Using the motor means the rear (motorised) truck is longer than the one that you make up for the un-motorised version. This means to obtain clearance you have to modify and reduce the length of the fuel tank by 2 studs which leaves an unsightly gap. Although alternative parts are included for you to do this, the inclusion of a few more parts (I have modified mine from spares) would have allowed for a reduction in length of only one stud, which gives the necessary clearance, but looks far better. Even with the constructive criticism the set still rates a maximum score.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-09T18:06:57Z","You can still get grey side frames with this set","In response to Bill, I have recently bought 4 of these - 2 from SAH and 1 each from 2 separate Lego Stores (UK) - they all came with grey side frames for the motor. If you don't mind the newer blue tint grey side frames you also get these with the new BNSF Geep 10133.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-04T03:09:16Z","Go get it.","after years of not having anything to do with Lego I have stumbled upon a picture of it on a website .
after saying to my self 'your not a child anymore' get over it ,your 30 yrs old.
then I thought , yes , I'm 30 yrs old that means I got the money to get it right now ,hell ,I got the money to get the all Santa fe train right now so after couple of double clicks and some $$$ I got it.

this is Lego at its best , buy it , you wont regret it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-23T02:55:02Z","Best Train Ever","This train is THE best train ever made!

I can't remember a train who's better than this!

I bought it all at once (2 locomotives, 5 train cars), and it was a pleasure to build.
So many pieces, and the best of it: You're not ready fast!
It cost me about 5 hours to build the whole train.

The only negative point about the train is the price...
I think the train hasn't to be expensive like that.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2006-09-21T07:45:14Z","The best locomotive","I consider this the best Lego locomotive! Only the BNSF is probably as great as this one! It has many special pieces, but no new, big pieces Lego tends to use now like the front part of the locomotive in set 4511. Some people, however, say that the roof is a problem. There are no bricks that make it stay in its place. Anyway, I want to say that my Super Chiefs have never lost their roofs, not even at high velocities. 

I have got four of these locomotives. Two of them are limited edition versions. The other two sets will probably be turned into B-units. They are simply great and I am sure you will not regret buying one! The Super Chief is so close to a real locomotive like no other locomotive before!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zac","2016-12-11T08:46:43.93Z","A Superb Representation","<p>I&rsquo;m amazed that no one has written a thorough review of this set, because 10020 Santa Fe Super Chief, although not without its flaws, easily represents one of the peaks of LEGO train production. It seems to have sold well, because three years later LEGO followed it up with the similarly excellent Burlington Northern Santa Fe Locomotive (10133).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As a Replica</strong></p>

<p>The Super Chief is unusual for its time in explicitly representing a real, historical engine, and the iconicity of the Super Chief&rsquo;s 1930s art deco design demands faithful recreation. The nose and paint job distinguish the Super Chief, but the smooth curves of both are challenging to translate into LEGO. The nose is a terrific build, composed of three graduated SNOT tiers at the bottom and smaller curved pieces at the top. It isn&rsquo;t as smooth as the real engine but with the limitations of the bricks a better design is difficult to imagine. I even like the fact that it&rsquo;s clearly made of bricks: this is LEGO, after all, and a perfectly smooth, molded piece would be far less interesting. The nose has been designed so that an electric light can be inserted behind the upper clear round 1x1, and the wiring run back into the cab. The red and yellow paint job is somewhat less successful, particularly on the sides: the curve beside and above the &ldquo;Sante Fe&rdquo; text should be more gradual and balanced. If one looks at it as a backwards &lsquo;S,&rsquo; the bottom curve is too flat; this could have been fixed with greater use of plates.</p>

<p>The only true flaw in the Super Chief&rsquo;s faithfulness to the real engine lies in its proportions. The nose is undersized compared to the window, which should be slightly lower. More importantly, the train is too skinny: it really should be seven or maybe even eight studs wide. I can&rsquo;t really criticize LEGO on this count because the train system is all six studs wide and if they made it wider all the accompanying train cars would also have to be wider. But the point should be made.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As a Toy</strong></p>

<p>The level of detail is outstanding, helped especially by the windows, doors, bars, and textured bricks along the side. The windows are printed, and the limited edition sets also come with a unique printed number tile as well as a small &ldquo;LEGO&rdquo; tile, both of which are exciting inclusions. The remaining details are stickers, albeit high quality ones. Not visible in photographs are the four black circular pieces with stickers on them on top of the engine. I&rsquo;ve no idea of their function but they add welcome detail to the top. The roof, however, has an unfortunate tendency to bow upwards, so it&rsquo;s never quite perfectly flat on top. The small module underneath the train uses a 4x2x2 brick with hollow studs on three sides to attach to two 1x2 holes in the bottom of the chassis. The connection is quite secure and the presence of the module vital: it would look terrible with a gap underneath.</p>

<p>Inside the engine we find an actual engine, quite detailed, as well as some tools (and places to attach them) and space for the driver to sit and the engineer to stand. There is a back door to connect to passenger cars but it doesn&#39;t open: this bothered me as a child. The minifigures are a missed opportunity: they&rsquo;re standard train fare from the early &lsquo;00s and should have been both exclusive and with details specific to the Super Chief or at least to the 1930s.</p>

<p>A 9V motor may be easily attached underneath the chassis, and if one wishes to have a working light wiring may be run up through the interior to the front. This possibility dramatically improves the playability of the model. Although I&rsquo;m largely unfamiliar with current motors, the locomotive has plenty of room inside and if the model engine were removed I imagine any sort of motor at most&nbsp;four studs wide could be installed.</p>

<p>Finally, the availability of extra train cars&mdash;five different cars in two multi-build sets (10022 and 10025)&mdash;really enhances the Super Chief. They&rsquo;re extremely expensive now and perhaps not worth the money given their relative dullness, but the Super Chief impresses on its own and deserves a spot in every train collection. Five stars.</p>
