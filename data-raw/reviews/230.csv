The parts collection is fascinating, with plenty of valuable pieces included. The helicopter is also of a rather decent design. It is of great value, because of the smallish size, but is plenty of fun to fiddle around with.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Matn","2008-01-04T13:56:44.7Z","The parts are cool?","I don't like this set that much. But there are some great parts in this one for 2 EUR. The minifig is awesome, the head and hat and the shirt is useable for in a Western village. The camera is just fantastic and the white stud comes two time in it. The gun and shovel is also a great adition. The flying thing (how can it fly!?) is weird...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T14:17:09.78Z","Little flyer","This is another small limited release set, this from the subtheme dino island of the adventurers theme. Is little and includes few pieces, but these still useful. The minifigure is the doctor kilroy, a character of the adventurer's story. The set is only a microcopter with the minifigure and some additions. The propeller of the vehicle is on it's backs and it have a different piece to like be the control. The colors are great, the don't very used green, in a great scheme with gray and some red pieces is a great thing for creations. Itens also are included like the hat of the minifigure, the movie camera that this hangs, a shotgun and a spade, that can be putted in this very easy. The builting is easy, have too plates to keep the propeller rotating above the minifigure. To play with it is easy, don't dismonting the microcopter, putting itens, weapons and the minifigure too. This is a small set, altough it, is useful for any themes. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Now, I appear to have two of these sets. I think one was mine and the other was my brothers...er...um, I mean, I have two sets. No Derek, I have no idea where your old LEGO went. Better ask mom, she probably gave it to the neighbors.</p>

<p>Unlike the other sets like Johnny Thunder and Jungle Surprise, I&#39;m not a huge fan of this one. The figure is, ok I guess. Old crazy man with pith helmet getting into hijinks, really breaking the adventure mold LEGO you silly goose. Wait a minute, hijinks isn&#39;t a word. How could you do this to me autocorrect? I trusted you and you betrayed me.</p>

<p>Where was I? Oh right, minifigure is meh, not much going on for parts or accessories, a gun a shovel and a camera, which judging by the picture is the reason Dr. Kilroy must have crashed that deathtrap. Eyes on the road you madman, you&#39;re going to get yourself killed!</p>

<p>Speaking of which, this is a god&nbsp;awful&nbsp;vehicle. How on earth does this thing fly? It&#39;s got this dinky little propeller and a couple of blocks. It is ridiculous! Don&#39;t even get me started on Dr. Kilroy&#39;s weight, way to much junk in the truck for that puny rig. Needs to get one of that 2014 police chinook to carry his fat ass around. Yeah I said it, I saw you eating all those pizzas, who are you fooling Doctor?</p>

<p>Overall, give this set a pass. Which is fortunate because they aren&#39;t in stores anymore. You have me to thank for that, having&nbsp;all two of them.</p>
