Pros:
You get nice acessories.
There are hidden compartments
Good figures

Cons:
Too expensive
No tender
Only one CAR?!
No real tracks for it to move on

So that's it but a good set if you want to fill the collection!!

when i built it i was actually pleased, because it was a lot of fun and provided many opportunities for extension or modification. so i could not resist to build a second wagon and a tender and to employ a 9v-motor to put it on the tracks (on brickshelf you will find many excellent modifications).
also did the quite basic station facade inspire me to build a full size train station (very basic, because i didn't have many bricks back then) - perhaps this was even the set that made me build my first own creations.
so although the set is far from being perfect, i give it a 5 for the sentimental value mainly.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Luke_Skytalker","2008-03-14T22:24:38.373Z","Hogwarts Express","I got this set one Christmas, when I was your ultimate Harry Potter fan. Now, however, I’m your ultimate star wars fan. Anyway, this would probably be the first Harry Potter lego merchandise I had acquired. I was young when I put it together, and I didn’t think that it was a challenging build nor did it take long. It is really nice constructing lego on Christmas; I enjoy constructing also on holiday or on a rainy day. So, When I finished I worked out how everything worked, though because I built it I already knew what was going to move or sway in and out, it’s not much of a surprise to me. 

I got quite confused at the instructions on the last page, as it had a picture of the train on some rails, with an electric console. Lego are just so lazy sometimes as they didn’t stick in rails. I have an electric train and I tried swapping the electric wheels and it didn’t work. The train is basically a model. Because of this, I got instructed not to destroy it. It6 had a lot of good pieces, and I just started taking the window pieces, making the roof unstable and collapse. I can balance it up, though. 

It is a good design but I didn’t bother with the stickers on the station, but carefully applied it to the train. I usually keep the sticker sheets hat come with my sets, otherwise they end up all hairy and dusty. The minifigs aren’t that special, but the minifig accessories are unique to my collection. There is a luggage cart or two, a few wands, a toad, and a very interesting card piece. This is a sticker too, I think, and it is a shiny picture of Dumbledore, it’s a bit weird, anyway. I wouldn’t buy it for the minifigs, anyway. The strange thing is that there is no train driver and so you can be fairly certain that the train will crash. Also not many people will care because there are only three on the train plus a frog which belongs to a very forgetful boy to the extreme as he missed the train. 

The train goes well with the flying car, and if you are crazy about Harry Potter like I used to be then this would be a crucial set for your collection. Unless of course there is the possibility that lego will make another train like this. Anyway, mine still remains looking like the train after the windows have been taken out because there are many uses for windows. So you could buy this set for the pieces, because right now that is a good reason for buying it. 

So this is the train that Harry takes to high school. I just take a bus everyday and start attending when I am thirteen, rather than eleven. Maybe he is a little young to tackle lord Voldemort, but the minifig of him here at eleven is the same as the minifig of him when he is five years older. No height difference either, as I notice in minifigs such as Dobby and children that there are legs that make them seem shorter and also their legs can’t bend. I find this really annoying but it really has nothing to do with this set, as the minifig legs are alright, just as normal. 

The front train, (IE where the engine is), is a nice place, but there is a few things wrong in it. Firstly, there is no one to drive the train. Oh well, all it needs to do is follow the tracks provided and then – wait, there are no tracks provided. Naughty Lego. Anyway, to reinforce the idea of the train inevitably crashing, there are a few more things that add to the lack of efficiency. Firstly, there is no space for the driver to see over, but that is alright because there is no driver. It’s probably a magical ghost train of some sort that lego intended to just stop at the station and even though they included a clock the train still wouldn’t go. Also, in the space where there should be engines is frogs and treasure chests. Honestly lego, let it go. I know that they take pride in their treasure chests and I like them too but the unnecessary placement of them is really strange. Who would go treasure hunting in a train engine? Next they’ll stick treasure chests inside Aragog’s belly or something. 

Anyway, the rest of the train is highly detailed. The front train especially. There are no train compartments as seen in the movies, just pathetic picnic tables it seems. The wheels are not that special, but can’t fit on 9 volt tracks. If you want something that will move of its own accord then you will have to look at the reviews for the motorised Express. The very front piece of the train is a circular dome piece with the text ‘Hogwarts Express’ on it. This would be a useful piece too if it didn’t have the writing on it. You could’ve made an imperial probe droid out of it but you really don’t want a droid that says ‘Hogwarts Express’ on it. In front of that piece is a lever piece which is also used at the controls. Below that are two lights so that the non-existent driver can see in the dark. A nice little detail is the side rails. They are used in the Sail Barge and can bend, but it only needs to be straight. 

Anyway, to Kings Cross Station. According to the latest Harry Potter books this is where you go to if you die. Not really that pleasant, going there in the afterlife I would imagine, but at least its actually there. It has no roof on top, and the entrance of 9 &#190; is just a large window piece with a revolving platform in it, as seen in the castle on the Fat Lady portrait. Nothing really special, but it would be the best piece for the job. 

There are a lot of minifig accessories on and off the train. In the train, is Hedwig, a toad, (presumably Neville’s), a treasure chest and the Dumbledore shiny piece. In the station, is a broom, (but not a flying broom, just one for cleaning), another treasure chest, a book and two carts. There is also a clock above the station. These come in useful now and again but I would think that it is a rare occasion when you find two treasure chests in a train station.

Overall, the minifigs aren’t great, the accessories are okay but if you were going to buy this set you’d buy it for the train itself, not the station. After all those years, lego still have no clue as to how to make a train station. It’s not good. Go buy this set if you want the Hogwarts Express, otherwise do not bother. It would have been nice for lego to have done a good job on the station but sadly Harry’s luck has expired. He is just barely in production by lego nowadays. People are more interested in star wars. People like me. Well, you now know exactly what you get in this set, so I suggest that you go and buy it if it meets your expectations. If not, buy the motorised one or get to like star wars. When the star wars contract ends, maybe we will be seeing more of these sets, but for now it is likely for Harry to become extinct. There are not too much Harry sets to go after, so this would go nice with other HP sets. So, nice pieces, get it while you can.

The overall set was good. Unfortunately there are no tracks or motor. I had to wait until the next train came out. What suprised me is that Lego normally will put the set number on the vehicles like Police Cars and stuff, but the train's number is not the set number.

<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The set contains three (yellow) minifigs- Harry in casual clothes, Ron in casual clothes, and Hermione in Hogwarts uniform.</p>
<p>I have lost Ron a while now though, but Harry and Hermione are good figures, even if Hermiones face is a bit off. Harry's torso is very versitile, good for City fans.</p>
<h4>The Train!</h4>
<p>The&nbsp;Express is wonderful, in my opinion, but Train fans may disagree. I personally love how it is mostly made of basic bricks and isn't overly detailed, but you can decide if you're a fan or not.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting features and nice parts. The only downside is that there&nbsp;is no glass on the windows.</p>
<h4>The Station!</h4>
<p>The station is a nice addition. Not great though. The door is really nice though, it swings around so you can transport your minifigs from Kings Cross to Platform 9 and 3 Quarters! :)</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>PROS:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Decent figures</li>
    <li>Brill train</li>
    <li>Station is ok</li>
    <li>Plenty of accessories</li>

<p>&nbsp;CONS:</p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2014-12-15T19:05:30.053Z","An alright set, but it needed a tender!","<p>I got this set back in 2001, as a Christmas present. Indeed, many of the presents my brothers and I received that year were from the brand spanking new LEGO Harry Potter range. I&#39;ve always been a train nut, so I was of course thrilled to have a set of the Hogwarts Express (though being a train buff I was of course perturbed by the absence of a tender). It was an utter joy to put together, and while I think mine is doomed to remain in pieces because of all the other things I&#39;ve built and want to build, I wouldn&#39;t mind tracking down another some day at the right price.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is lovely, with a sandstone arch framing a picture of the set, in which the train is steaming out of the station. The instructions are mostly good, but there is one part where some extra angles would have been helpful in assembling a&nbsp; gimmick in the locomotive.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is just absolutely chock full of useful parts that can be used for many things. The train itself offers some nice basic bricks as well as windows, curved bricks, train baseplates, and some of those hinged airplane roof pieces. Platform 9 and 3/4 offers baseplates, an arch, some fencing, lamp posts, large wall elements, and two pieces that make a secret door. However, the revolving secret door piece is flawed; the spurs which hold it in are even smaller than those of the classic casement windows, and can easily get worn down. Pity, really; the idea is nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set includes 3 minifigures: Harry Potter himself along with Ron Weasley, both in Muggle clothing, and Hermione Granger in Hogwarts robes - rare ones with no house trim, badge, and tie (which was a small but dumb decision by the costuming department because the books establish that the robes are just plain black and students can&#39;t tell just by looking what house someone&#39;s in), instead having just black Hogwarts trim and such. And here&#39;s where the LEGO Harry Potter line goofed up: The Hogwarts robes are supposed to be black, but the first two years of sets used light gray! Prisoner of Azkaban-onward didn&#39;t entirely fix the problem, the dark blay was at least closer to being black. They each have a wand and some luggage.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is, for the most part, easy to do but rather enjoyable. The station platform and the carriage are a smooth build from start to finish. The engine is the same way for the most part, but there is one part that due to the angles used can be tricky to get built properly: A secret lever that ejects the included steamer trunk (well, a treasure chest being used to represent one) from the concealed storage spot in the boiler.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once the set is built in its entirety, it looks very nice indeed, even without the tender. Platform 9 and 3/4 has some nice sticker details (I am not a sticker-whiner; hell, I like them! Speaking of the stickers, apparently some versions include an additional small sticker to turn a blank yellow 1x1 tile included with the set into the Chocolate Frog Card with Dumbledore on it. This does not seem to have been in the U.S. releases) to make it feel like it really is a secret part of a larger station, and it also has some nice amenities like a luggage cart and a hand-truck. The Belleville lamp-posts and sign give the right look for it too. The engine does a good job looking like the repainted-in-red Olton Hall that portrayed it in the movie (which was a questionable choice; an actual LMS loco would have suited the St. Pancras-misremembered-as-King&#39;s-Cross station better and besides that would not have scraped the station platforms on the line as it puffed along), even matching the wheel arrangement and having some pieces on to represent the splashers. There&#39;s even a clever use of rounded 4-stud-high bricks to make the Belpaire firebox. It&#39;s a nuisance to build the launcher right, but if you do it does a good job catapulting the steamer trunk out from the secret compartment. The coach looks a treat too, with nice windows for passengers to look out from and be seen as occupying it through (Note: The windows have no panes. Odd, but whatever). The one visual flaw is that it doesn&#39;t have corridor ends - the Hogwarts Express uses corridor coaches for certain, since characters are able to walk down the length of the train. The roof and windows are a separate section from the base wall of the coach, lifting off wholesale for access. There&#39;s only seating room for four, a bit light, but it&#39;s roomy seating. The engine and the coach both sit on non-turning dummy bogies (well, on the engine one of them is supposed to be the drive wheels which wouldn&#39;t be on a pivoting block anyhow), which can be easily removed and replaced with real ones (including the 9-volt motor bogie) - a bit cheeky, but the set was already $50. Didn&#39;t bother me at all since, having received 4561 Railway Express the Christmas prior, I already had everything necessary. Interestingly, the wheels on the dummy bogies will actually sit atop LEGO train rails, so you could save a few bucks by just rebuilding three of them to pivot.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a very nice set, both as a Harry Potter set and as a LEGO train. It&#39;s not without its flaws, though. It comes off feeling slightly light and lacking next to fellow $50 set 7150 TIE Fighter and Y-Wing, something that perhaps could have been rectified by including the parts for a tender (the omission of the tender is the biggest flaw by far). And maaayybe a figure of poor Neville Longbottom, who was neglected by the line. Still, it&#39;s a good set to have.</p>

"InvisibleTimmy","2017-07-15T22:31:59.843Z","A great older set!","<h3>*I acquired the set off eBay, and it did not come with box/instructions, so I found the instructions online.</h3>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>The build starts with the Platform 9 3/4 model, the minifigs, and the trolley.</p>

<p>Next, you build the locomotive, and finally, the passenger car.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Hermione wears an Old Light Gray Gryffindor uniform and the classic starry cape element.She has a slightly creepy face print with HUGE mouth and plain black eyes, and old brown molded hair. She carries a Tan wand.</p>

<p>Harry Potter wears a Blue jacket over an Old Light Gray shirt, as well as Tan pants.He has his older styled face with glasses and a calm expression, plus a more stylized scar than recent figures.He is accessorized with an Old Brown wand, a Chocolate Frog card, and a starry cloak.</p>

<p>Ron Weasley is the final minifigure in the set. He wears a blue sweater and Old Gray pants, and carries an Old Gray wand, as well as Scabbers the rat, and also comes with a starry cape element.</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Completed</b> <b>Model</b></p>

<p>The trolley is a simple model, utilizing 1x2 and 1x1 w/ corner wall elements, and carries a black and a brown suitcase. There is a handle for figures to grasp as they push the trolley. There&#39;s not really much else to say about it.</p>

<p>The locomotive is prominently red and black, with yellow accents. It features a small cab, and most of that is taken up by the large brake lever.Pulling this lever ideally ejects a trunk from the front, but it doesn&#39;t work that well. However, the details, while simple, make this instantly recognizable.</p>

<p>The trunk&nbsp;is an Old Brown treasure chest which has 2 chrome gold keys inside.</p>

<p>The passenger car is a long train car with 4 windows on each side. The top half lifts off, and the interior can then be accessed. The inside of the car features 2 tables with benches &nbsp;and there is adequate space to put 4 minifigures inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The station is simple, but provides some extra play value. I am very fond of the spinning wall that allows you to get in to Platform 9 3/4. The model itself looks the part, and the stickered sign is a nice touch. There is also a nice detail with the clock.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>This is a great set. It&rsquo;s a fun toy, a must for HP collectors, and is a nice little build. I would definitely recommend it for a good price.</p>

"Mr__Thrawn","2022-02-02T19:43:11.567Z","Good For the Time, But Ultimately Inessential","<p><strong>#4708 Hogwarts Express</strong></p>

<p><strong>Harry Potter</strong></p>

<p><strong>2001</strong></p>

<p><strong>410 parts</strong></p>

<p><strong>$50 (2001) / $78.76 (2021)</strong></p>

<p>The initial model of the iconic Hogwarts Express is still an interesting collector&#39;s item and historical artefact, but it has been exceeded in quality by subsequent releases.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t own many train sets, so lots of the common parts in this set are very interesting to me. The train carriage base is fairly limited in use, but it works really well for what it is. The magnetic couplings are interesting, as are the train windows. The stickers&nbsp;on my set have mostly begun to crack, although they&#39;re well-designed and the holographic foil sticker has held up well. The printed parts are limited but interesting, especially the useful 1x1 number tiles, and the red lampposts, shock absorber, chromed keys,&nbsp;and red Fabuland sign are nice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not much of a fan of the original Harry Potter minifigures; I think that their faces are very poorly designed, excessively detailed. The hair on Hermione is good, though, and the torso prints are fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Rebuilding this set a few days ago helped me appreciate the deliberate pace and flow of modern LEGO builds. It&#39;s not a difficult or unpleasant build, but it&#39;s rather oddly paced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Completed Model</b></p>

<p>I do really like the completed train, it looks great on display and has a sort of blocky, angular charm. The colour blocking is really good, the interior space is used pretty well, and I also like the station build. The spinning wall is clever, and there&#39;s lots of space and objects for figures to interact with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Play Value</strong></p>

<p>The train, being, you know, a train, is automatically an effective play model. It&#39;s solid enough to withstand play, and the addition of the station allows for additional play scenarios. The bizarre play feature with the shock absorber doesn&#39;t work at all, though. Conceptually, it doesn&#39;t make sense for the context of the set, and in practice it often shatters the whole front of the locomotive. It is nice how the activator is disguised as the train&#39;s brake lever, that&#39;s a clever integration of the play feature and, if nothing else, allows a child to role-play the train stopping.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Price</b></p>

<p>The price (adjusted for inflation) of $79 is altogether too much for this set, in my opinion. The train is decently sized, but there are only three minifigures and the model is somewhat sparse, so the price doesn&#39;t feel justified. Its current aftermarket price is around $60 used or $150 new, which I think is reasonable for a set of its vintage, especially considering that it&#39;s the first iteration of a perennial best-seller.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is fine. It&#39;s better than many others from its time, and of course it&#39;ll be of interest to collectors, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a must-have by any means. The 2018 version can be obtained for a similar price to this one, and it&#39;s far better in my opinion. This is a case of a perfectly good set being rendered quaint by hindsight and subsequent developments.</p>
