"canbayram","2017-12-13T13:37:42.383Z","Convertible Hot Rod & Desert Buggy","<p>Being an AFOL I had pulled myself away from LEGO for a looong time due to the fact that LEGO was expensive and I had moved away and had to look after myself in the first place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2014 I visited a toy store and I saw this set on the shelf and I realized it was not that expensive as I remember LEGO was. So I bought it instantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Model:</p>

<p>This is a Hot Rod which has also a convertible top. It has two types of tyres&nbsp;to give that Hot Rod Soul. I just don&#39;t like the colour scheme so much. It might be red or yellow instead of blue just to my opinion. The car has a turbocharged V6 engine. 6 bucket elements make the exhausts of the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The top is operated by the small gear on the right side just behind the door. To me its mechanism is very ingenious. Turning the gear first raises the two panels at the back, at the same time raising the black top and folding it to the back and hiding under the panels finally lowering those two panels back in place. Long to read, but this happens in a single movement. Just a half turn of the small wheel which controls the top. That&#39;s it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another ingenious&nbsp;design for me is the steering. It is provided by turning the black cross axle at the back with the combination of technical beams, axles and two technic angular wheel and a Lt Steering Gear. I really like this design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t like is that the power from the engine is given only to one of the rear wheels. Although this was also true to the cars from that era, being a Hot Rod with a hugely modified engine, this had to have a differential or at least power both rear wheels but it is not a big problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I liked the model a lot and it still sits on a shelf at home. It was sold at around 100 TL in Turkey at that time which is normal to the price count. My kindled fire for LEGO would stay kindled until late 2016 when I:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/52431"">Review: Volvo EW160E</a></p>
