<p>This set would be a great gift to a young LEGO civil engineer.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box shows the three machines working together on a LEGO building site.</p>

<p>The yellow wheel loader is pushing <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4125220"" target=""_blank"">boulders</a>&nbsp;for the red excavator&nbsp;to collect which are then placed in the back of the blue and grey dump truck.</p>

<p>The parts are separated into three numbered bags which align with the three instruction books.</p>

<p>Book number 1 builds the red excavator.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7411/16381854536_2fdc62616f_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Book number 2 builds the blue and grey dump truck.</p>

<p>Book number 3 builds the yellow wheel loader.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a good range of Technic parts. It includes two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4612100"">small linear actuators</a>, &nbsp;one <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4525904"">universal joint</a>, a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4652236"">small turntable</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6047885"">small tracks</a>, a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4562379"">small trench bucket</a> and a small <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6023352"">bulldozer&nbsp;blade</a>.</p>

<p>There is a good selection of gears including some bevel gears.</p>

<p>LEGO Technic introduced a new <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6055519"">I-Beam Frame</a> and a new&nbsp;<a href=""http://rebrickable.com/parts/15457"">Technic Worm Gear</a>&nbsp;in 2014. This set has three I-Beams and one worm gear. This&nbsp;worm gear is not listed in the inventory and the inventory and instruction book lists the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6037533"">old worm</a> by mistake.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are several Technic building techniques incorporated in this set.</p>

<p>Each model is a simple but extremely effective&nbsp;build. Enormous amounts of fun can be had driving the machines around, moving the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4125220"" style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">boulders</a><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;to and fro.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LEGO suggest&nbsp;that this set is suitable for young builders aged between 8 to 14 years old. I believe this set will be a great gift for a younger builder to introduce them into the Technic world.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As this set makes up three construction crew machines, it allows for a mini building site to be created.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7432/16406908952_3d4fa4dcdb_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>LEGO has a fourth <a href=""http://service.lego.com/en-us/buildinginstructions/42023"">scraper model PDF instructions</a>. There is a slight adjustment required to accommodate the new worm gear which raises&nbsp;and lowers the scraper blade.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7442/15792457744_afb54410b9_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set will not be a challenge for adults but would be a fantastic introduction to Technic gearing for younger builders. There is such a great range of Technic building techniques to show emerging engineers how machinery works.</p>

<p>Use this set as a stepping stone from traditional LEGO up to Technic for your younger builders.</p>

"Matthias_K","2016-06-09T00:32:33.35Z","Sometimes 3x less is more","<p>I had been eyeing this set for a while, because it&#39;s a very good looking set. Yet, I worried that it might be a better set to play with than to build and I do not really play with my sets anymore. When I received some money for my birthday, I finally bit the proverbial bullet and I&#39;m glad I did!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going into too much detail about the models, because there&#39;s already an excellent&nbsp;review that also shows&nbsp;the models in pictures. I just want to say that all of the models are very good designs that manage to do a lot with only a few parts. Despite the&nbsp;small scale, the functions work great and the models look great as well. Very well done. My favorite (both in functions and in looks)&nbsp;is the excavator and I&#39;m glad they went with a red color&nbsp;scheme here. The truck is my least favorite in terms of functions, but it looks great and is very sturdy.</p>

<p>I have not tried to build the alternative scraper, because to me it doesn&#39;t look that great. However, this&nbsp;set has inspired me to come up with new vehicles on the same scale to extent this excellent crew and isn&#39;t that what Lego&#39;s all about?</p>

<p>the truck has hand of god steering and the back tips</p>

<p>the excavator has a adjustable main rig with a bucket extender. it also spins in the tracks</p>

<p>lastly the front loader swivels in the middle and goes up and down to go to the ground</p>
