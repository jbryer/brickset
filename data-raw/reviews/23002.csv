There are 3 in this set, with 2 controlling the arms that raise and lower the container (called a skip in the UK) and a smaller one operating the legs.</p>

<p>So, this is one model that I&#39;ve been waiting to see realised in Lego Technic, and I&#39;m not disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Features include front steering, support legs at the back and a removeable skip container that can be lowered or tipped, depending on whether the legs are lowered or not. A feature that isn&#39;t mentioned on the box, is that the cab doors open.</p>

<p>The process of lowering the legs/container is controlled by a simple gear exchange - operated by the yellow lever on the left hand side of the vehicle. The operation itself is done by turning a black wheel on the right hand side, though it takes a good many turns (especially if offloading the container). The whole mechanism can be motorised by using 8293 Power Functions. The battery box fits snuggly behind the cab, while the motor is well hidden underneath.</p>

<p>The appearance is certainly complimented by the use of primary colours, with the greys and blacks reserved for the chassis. The only downside is the number of stickers: 20 in total, though all are applied to individual bricks.</p>

<p>The pieces (nearly 1000) are not sorted into numbered bags like some sets, so having a number of trays or containers to sort the pieces in, is essential.</p>

<p>The instructions are spread across 2 books, with the first showing you how to build the chassis, while the second book focuses on the cab and skip. It also has the checklist and Power Functions instructions.</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>Build: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tricky in places, but enjoyable.</p>

<p>Appearance &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 4.5</p>

<p>Colour scheme is the greatest asset. Too many stickers. Why the bar across the middle of the skip?</p>

<p>Playability &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;5</p>

<p>It works so well, even if the mechanism feels slightly heavy.</p>

<p>Value for money &nbsp; 4</p>

<p>Even though its a great set, &pound;59.99 is a little steep.</p>

<p>Overall &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4.5</p>

<p>What can I say? It does what a skip truck does. A bit pricey, but an interesting model.</p>

"Freekysch","2014-04-14T12:25:38.23Z","Great mid-range set, love it !","<p>When i first saw this set in the stores i was not very fond of it. I thought it was looking unfinished and i really did not like the cab design, but recently i got the opportunity to get this set at a very good price so i went for it. I was not dissapointed at all !</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is standard, maybe a little too big for a set this size. I was glad the instructions and the sticker sheet were undamaged. One thing i have noticed was that there were no loose parts in the box (tires were in the bags). The set comes with 2 instruction manuals.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part list is decent, nothing too great, i think the only things that you are going to like are the new tires and the blue 5x11 pannels. The set also includes 2 LA and 1 mLA, which is nice. If you are a gear fan, this is a set that you will like - it has a gearbox. Nothing to fancy, but it has one.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun, relaxing and simple. It took me about 4 hours to build it and there were no mistakes in the instruction manuals. For me, it was a very enjoyable build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>After you finish the model, you have in your face a lovely skip truck, with some very nice functions. In fact, there are 3 functions on the truck:</p>

<p>- you can lower and raise the rear outriggers.<br />
<br />
- empty the container</p>

<p>- load and unload the container</p>

<p>All these functions are controlled by a gearbox as i mentioned earlier. The steering is done by HOG on the top of the cab.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all, this is a great little truck (well, not so little, it has about the same dimensions as the 8109 Flatbed Truck), with 3 nice functions that work without any flaws. The design is not so great, the cab still looks a little unfinished, but it is ok. The new wheels really bring this model to life, so i am very glad i bought it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end, you should get this set and i think you will not be let down by it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cheers !</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Parts</span></p>

<p>Nothing terribly notable about the parts. A couple of linear actuators which are always fun to work with since they were introduced, and a miniture LA as well, and this was the first time I&#39;d use this. They seem a tad flimsy to me, but worked ok</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty standard affair, and anyone who&#39;s built a set with linear actuators will certainly get than sense of de-ja vu as they build. That&#39;s not to say it&#39;s dull or anything - but it&#39;s not going to tax you - this is one you can complete in an evening whilst watching doing something more sociable like talking to family - perfect, brownie points earnt there.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The completed model</span></p>

<p>The final model is a fun skip truck. I fitted the power functions, as the lowering &amp; raising action took quite some time - &nbsp;even with the PF&#39;s it takes some time, but at least saves your fingers. For me, something wasn&#39;t quite right at the back as it didn&#39;t lower as I think it should have 0 it was catching in a way I don&#39;t think it was meant to - but didn&#39;t bother changing it - too much gassing whilst building, you see.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A solid build, and a good addition to your technics collection. Probably a tad over priced at &pound;60, but I paid just under &pound;50, which I think is a good price to pay for this set.</p>

"darkshadow79","2017-01-07T22:39:59.58Z","A great mid-sized container truck","<p>One of my favorites, the 42024 Container Truck. &nbsp;I think this model is an excellent follow-up, likely from the same Technic designer, from the 8052 Container Truck from 2010. &nbsp;That set&#39;s functions we&#39;re a bit easier for unloading the container than the 42024&#39;s is, but this set has some great attributes as outlined below.</p>

<p>The container is much deeper and larger than the 8052&#39;s container was. &nbsp;When I first saw this set I thought it looked more like a trash truck than a container loader/unloader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is a great medium-length build depending on your experience with Technic&#39;s axles, gears, and making sure everything meshes correctly, as is the case with almost all medium to large size Technic sets. &nbsp;I really enjoyed the build of the chassis and gearbox, then assembling the container itself. &nbsp;It is fixed to a top bar via 2 sets of new style chain links. &nbsp;The chain links&nbsp;can be a bit tricky to assemble correctly as you have to watch the alignment when linking them together to make sure they are going the same direction, otherwise you end up with one chain or the other not working properly and when tipping and/or unloading the container it will unload unevenly.</p>

<p>The functions include working steering via HOG steering located on the top of the cab, and then depending on which function you select via the gear selector on the side of the truck you can either raise the container and tip it to unload the contents or slide the container on/off the truck. &nbsp;One hitch and something I&#39;m not too clear on is if you decide to release the container off the bed of the truck, the chains have to manually be popped off the top of the container itself. I always look at functions realistically and wonder how the driver could climb the container to release the chains. &nbsp;The set loses one point for authenticity there. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, there are 3 different colours&nbsp;on the model. &nbsp;I think the colouring should have been consistent with the entire truck itself, then another colour for the container. &nbsp;Just a little criticism there. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately though you get a great model that is really fun to build and play with. It really works great if you also have the 8052 Container Truck as a partner for all container needs. &nbsp;</p>

"SPAZiNZ","2021-01-10T04:05:08.04Z","DREADFUL TO BUILD!!!!","<p>I will first say I love technic .. so don&#39;t think this review is coming from a non technic builder..&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the first few steps went well. some different techniques that I actually didn&#39;t predict during the build.. then... then I got mid build and sticker time. pins pins pins pins axles pins pins axles pins and stickers. LEGO, please do not tell me to apply stickers after I have built a section. I now have to dismantle the section to properly apply the sticker, thanks. LEGO, please don&#39;t have me apply a 13 pin hole beam to 7 pins that are all connected to different areas and strength pieces, specifically book #2 step #74 and #75. this took me 35 minutes to complete alone. trying to align 7 pins and apply equal pressure here was almost my quitting point to this set. I had a easier time building the LIEBHERR. rant is over review is over&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>closing notes: I never finished this dreadful mess. this set is now just parts in my bins.&nbsp;</p>
