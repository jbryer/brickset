"Lego_fan_","2019-01-19T23:19:10.967Z","Beautiful Ornament","<p>This is a really nice Lego ornament which makes a beautiful addition to the Christmas tree. It is a nice little build and it comes with the ball so you can put your own ornament in it. The ribbon is my only real complaint because the Lego brick prints can come off. I would highly suggest this set to any Lego fan.</p>
