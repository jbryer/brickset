"Luke_Skytalker","2008-05-18T00:17:48.56Z","Hogwarts Castle","I got this set for one Christmas quite a few years ago. The story was that it was half price, and since I was into Harry Potter at that age, I got it from my parents who purchased it at $100 NZ, $200 being the recommended retail price. I was so young then, that there was a few confusing and frustrating colour mismatches in the castle, but it was alright in the end. It took me two days to build, and I was really happy with the final result. 

The whole castle is built up in sections, which many lego fans seem to like. Firstly, I’ll start with the boat, as it is the first thing built. There is only one boat, which comes with a chain and fire torch. Malfoy and Hagrid are supposed to sit in the boat. A very useful boat, goes well with the Dumstrang ship. It also floats, as long as there isn’t a strong current. It has a torch piece with fire in it and chains to keep it stuck to whatever boats are stuck to nowadays. Next you build the first tower. It’s kind of pointless because no one can stand safely anywhere in it. Next you build a second tower much like the first except with an archway underneath for the boat to go under. So really it is quite small and insignificant and the thing that I do not like about it is that there is no place for the boat to dock. But at the back of the instructions there are a few alternative instructions, and one includes making a wharf.

Next is the library. There isn’t much to it, but there are a few moving parts which are always nice to have. Firstly, the base moves, so you can separate the fireplace to everything else. The fireplace also moves. It is attached to a rotating pillar via a rubber band. Twist the pillar around, and then the fireplace rotates and you can see the treasure chest behind it. Nice design idea, I had thought when I built it. Another thing that moves is the bookshelf. It falls downwards pushing all the books onto the ground. It isn’t very practical and I don’t really know the purpose. There is a small desk and a spiral staircase that can move into a complete wall. There are a couple of archways for people to go through and nice accessories too. This is where you put the first tower you made on top of. The instruction manual seems to imply that Hermione is supposed to come here often.

Next is the Griffindor Common Room. The Fat Lady portrait can rotate allowing people to go through. The mechanism used isn’t much like the movies though. You start off building a completely grey minifig dressed in a suit of armour. I think that he is supposed to be Voldemort. There is a light blue diamond behind the place where he stands. A small balcony does the place good as the common room is above several floors. A small lever is used at the bottom of the common room connected to a chain that connects to a small secret compartment above. When the lever is pulled towards you, the compartment opens on the next floor. The floor above the secret compartment floor is the astronomy room, where there is a small telescope and tower piece. The tower piece lifts off so that the stars can be seen. 

Next is the assembly hall. Really it is kind of a joke because it is just the front part of the hall, which is stupid because it can only seat the professors. That means that the hall is for staff only, except for Voldemort, as there is a secret compartment for him, and then he reappears inside a suit of armour in the Gryffindor common room. Although it doesn’t occupy many, the hall is unnecessarily tall. At the bottom, it is made out of large rock pieces, and then goes into pillars to make it look like it is on a mountain. The pillars are very good for temples, but there are only two. Next is the roof. I think that owls are supposed to rest up there or something. The actual roof part of the roof isn’t even lego. It is just a piece of paper designed to clip on to a lego piece, and it is on a 45 degree slant, with a tiled pattern. Just under the feeble roof, there are torches with fire in them, and they actually float in midair! Well, that’s what lego tries to make it look like. Unfortunately, they used colourless transparent pieces that would have been more versatile if they had colour. So really, the hall was a letdown.


That was really the whole castle, but I think that the minifigs helped sell it. Though, it was on clearance, so I don’t think that it did a very good job being sold. The minifigs, I admit, are alright. Dumbledore and Hagrid were the best, and the Hagrid minifig was completely customised, and although he could only move his arms, I think he is alright. He has an almost expressionless face, but then has a beard piece overtop. I like how Lego captured his eyes really well, because JK Rowling was going on about how big his eyes were, so lego managed to include that. Dumbledore also had a beard piece overtop of a small mouthed face with spectacles, covered by a large, long, separate hair piece over the beard. He had a purple cape. Hermione placement was quite characteristic, as she is always in the Library. The uniform was quite good, but it said Gryffindor on it, so it couldn’t be used for much. She had a black cape, with stars on the underside of it. Ron was the same, except he had a bowlcut hairpiece on top of a freckled and worried looking face. Harry had glasses, and was wearing a different Uniform. My guess is that the uniform is for students that have not been placed in their houses yet, but that doesn’t explain why he is on a broom. The two Voldemorts were slightly different, the one in the armour had a completely grey suit on and the one in the hall had a completely grey suit on with a grey vest, much the same. They were kind of lame, but the suit was nice. Snape is so cool. I like his hair and his clothes. But most of all, I like his head. His head is cool because it is glow in the dark, which is cool. I don’t have a glow in the dark head, but I think it would give you difficulties when you try to go to sleep. Malfoy has the same uniform as Hermione and Ron’s, but he wears the Slytherin emblem. He has a kind of disgruntled look on his face, and blond hair. One of the worst things about these minifigs is that they all have yellow skin, which doesn’t go well with flesh toned figs. 

The minifig accessories vary, as there are a lot of them. Firstly, I shall describe the wands. They are way too long! The problem with lego a few years ago is that they couldn’t get anything to minifigure scale, including the minifigs. For one example, buzz droids. Anyway, the wands should have at least been replaced with three stud long cylindrical pieces, and that may bring it to appropriate scale. One of the black wands can be used as the Emperor’s walking stick, and if you were making an Emperor minifig from your collection I recommend using Snape’s head. Next, the diamonds. They are quite nice, and with a treasure chest for storage. Then there are the goblets, which are really quite pointless. And then there are the animals. They don’t have any moving parts at all. The animals are bats, owls and rats. Really only decoration, as you can’t really play with them.

One of the things that annoyed me most was the different shades of colours. In the hall, for example, there is a nice little shade of purple for Dumbledore. In the knight bus set, you’ll notice that the shade of purple is completely different. Also, if you’ll look at the reviews for the knight bus, it’ll say that there are even multiple shades of purple on the bus or not. I’m not sure whether I agree or disagree. Another example, is that the dark grey pieces in this set are older, and slightly different to the dark grey pieces made now. They aren’t much different apart, but when connected together it is quite noticeable. I just hate how lego keep changing everything when they shouldn’t be. One of the worst recent things that lego has done, is changing the stormtrooper helmets ever so slightly. I hope that in future lego will just keep everything as it is. 

Overall, this set is worth your buy, but only if it is on sale. What surprises me is that lego still hasn’t made a Lego Harry Potter video game. I would buy it, if they would make it. I think that this set is good for pieces, and that is why I have taken it apart. Though, some pieces cannot have any other use than in the castle, and that is why sometimes stickers are better than printed bricks; stickers are optional. You can’t make much star wars things with stone brick walls. So, overall, some letdowns are the kind of bricks that lego had decided to use, but it is still an alright set. I think perhaps the later versions of this castle would be a better buy. Good for building up your collection though.

"Quirrelthesquirrel","2009-01-12T17:06:43.903Z","Awesome castle!","I got this set of eBay for $220 AUD brand new in box. It has a good selection of minifigs. The great hall is a bit small but has a chair for Dumbledore amd a bench that can only fit three people. There is a secret box in the hall that contains a pink gem. On the long table there is two cups amd a letter. There should also be a chocolate frog card but when I got the set the sticker for it was not in the box! At the top there is a crystal ball and a rat. The owlery and fireplace area are good but they could have added something else to that area. You get four owls in the set and  there is a clear treasure chest with a yellow and blue gem. Gryffindor tower is a bit small but you get a knight and behind him is an aqua gem! If you go to the classroom above there is a box with potions on it. If you pull the lever in the Gryffindor dorm the box opens and there is a gold key inside! Next is the astronomy tower where there is a telescope and a book. In the library downstairs, there is desk with a little box inside that has a spell and on the shelf you get the screaming book, a potion book and a plants book. If the push the shelf it falls over.

"mngoult","2009-11-03T12:45:04.623Z","Good effort from Lego all round","I picked up this set with box and instructions for £25 on ebay and the first thing that struck me was the number of interesting pieces inlcuded with this set.

Its a fairly simple build that creates two main sections and a weird little tunnel piece. The main hall is nicely detailed and constructed, it could do with being wider as it gets very unsteady, especially when sitting on 4730.

This is the appeal of the set for me its goes well with the chamber of secrets to create a massive multi-layered castle. 8 minifgs seems fair but i would've preferred mcgonical (not sure of spelling ) rather than another snape. 

It features lots of moving pieces, hidden treasure chests and interesting nooks and crannies. The loft on top of the main hall is a little squashed in and the paper roof on top really lets the overall look down. 

In fact the only real let down with this set is the roof sections, there either pre-fabricated green sections or made of paper/card. A similare roof as seen on the black falcons fortress would have given this set an extra star.

As it stands its a solid four, a good effort for the first large HP set released but definete room for improvement. The benchmarks for all my reviews is how long my two year can play with the set before getting bored, i take off all the small bits and supervise carefully but even at two he appreciates the hidden sections and different levels. 

Pros
-Lots of moving sections allowing good playability
-8 minifigs including dumbledore and Hagrid
-Seperate sections allow for expansion and making different combinations
-Lovely looking set with realistic castle colours


Cons
-Considering how tall it is, its very narrow
-Poor effort made for the roof sections
-Stair case moves to much (yes i know its supposed to according to the films but still it is not solid enough for me)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"LegoAdventures","2011-03-25T07:38:26.48Z","Hogwarts Castle","This set is a very memorable and instant classical set that is truly a Masterpiece. It is a set that I love dearly and is very close to me as all of the Harry Potter sets are, It was also the very first Hogwarts Castle, And one of the best renditions of Hogwarts Castle ever created. The thing that I love about the classical LEGO Harry Potter sets is that the designers were thinking about the Magical feeling, the Enchantment and the true Harry Potter feeling. Many people disagreed and disliked the fact that many of the original LEGO Harry Potter sets had strange colour combinations, gaps and no walls however that's what made them so unique and magical. Some sets Indeed had large gaps however they resembled Windows, or ease of access to the set. Personally having large clustered walls wouldn't look very nice or interesting in my opinion, and everyone would be expecting to same old build through every set. In a way I think the designers had the Number 1 priority of making the sets Magical, Enchanting, Mysterious and Fun. That's what I love about this set is that it has all the Magic, Enchantment, Mysteries, Warmth and Fun within.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Released in 2001 to coincide the Blockbuster release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Philosophers</span> Stone (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sorcerers Stone for the U.S</span>), it contains 682 Pieces, 8 Mini-figures and 3 Sections of Hogwarts Castle. I managed to get this set of Ebay.com.au for $250 AUD In a New Sealed Box in Excellent Condition and I can strongly say it was definitely well worth the money for this Incredible set. <br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions: <br></h4><br>The Box is 57cm Long, 38cm Tall and 6.8cm Thick. It contains the usual offerings you find on a LEGO Box like the Red LEGO Insignia. All around the Box, it is covered in the Hogwarts Stone walls. On the back of the Box there is 3 Alternative Sets which you can build from the back of the Instructions. There is also many images of the features in the Castle and an Image of all the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Philosophers Stone</span> sets together. On the side of the Box there is the usual Trademarks, Licensed Agreements, Future References and where the Components are made, For this particular set it says Made in Denmark however in small writing it says (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Textiles made in China</span>) which isn't on any of the other Philosophers Stone sets or Chamber of Secret sets they all are Made in Denmark only or Denmark and Switzerland. So I presume they made the Textiles in China for a bit of a cheaper option considering the size of the model and the popularity it had at the time. That's one thing I love about LEGO is that it's Quality European Manufactured. At the front of the Box there is a flap which enables you to flip the flap up and see numerous images of Hogwarts. On the top part of the flap there is an image of Harry, Ron and Hermione in the Year 1 Hogwarts Boats looking at Hogwarts in the distance. There is also numerous images of Accessories in the set and other techniques and Illustrations of the Castle. The Bottom flap shows the entire set and what it contains inside. It shows the Mini-figures, Accessories and the 3 sections of the Castle. The bottom flap is actually stuck on with 4 long pieces of sticky-tape which is the way you open the set. By cutting the sticky-tape with a knife (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">In-case you want to keep the Box in good condition for future reference</span>) then lifting the flap stuck on you will find everything inside waiting to be built hehe :). There is 6 Bags which are numbered so the Building Experience will be neat and more simple. There is also a very small sticker, which is a picture of Albus Dumbledore on a sort of Metallic Chrome Background, and when you tilt it to the side and back and fourth there's a sort of Rainbow effect and he reappears much clearer. This sticker I found in the Instruction Booklet when I picked the Instruction Booklet up it slid out so be cautious.

It is also has 2 Hinges on it so the Owlery Section and the small fireplace section underneath can swing back and fourth whilst still being connected to the Library/Gryffindor Common Room and Astronomy Tower section. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">First Floor:</span><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Small Fireplace section on the bottom floor and Owlery:<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></span></span>You start of with a Dark Grey 8 x 8 Base plate followed by 2 small turntable LEGO pieces. You build a Pylon (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pillar</span>) which underneath it has a Yellow Rubber Band which is attached to 2 Turn Tables. The Pylon is on 1 of the Turn Tables so now when you turn the Pylon (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pillar</span>) the Yellow Rubber Band that is attached to both Turn Tables turns the Second Turn Table. Now you build a small Fireplace formation ontop of the spare Turn Table. Behind the Fireplace formation is a Trans-Clear Treasure Chest with 1 Yellowish Green Trans Neon Diamond and 1 Trans-Blue Diamond. So the Idea is when students come along they see an Innocent Fireplace however when you turn the Pillar the 2 Turn Tables spin and the Second Turn Table has the Fireplace on top, so the Fireplace then turns around revealing the Chest full of the secret Rare Diamonds. You then build around this mechanism and above numerous arch formations consisting of Light Grey and Cream and Tan pieces which soon come to a small perch for 1 Dark grey Owl and 1 White Owl (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hedwig</span>) to sit on, this is the Owlery. You then build a small Tower structure which goes over the 2 Owls perched on the Perch so they become concealed and hidden in the Owlery, which is quite cute and cosy haha. <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br>Library:</span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>Next to the Fireplace section which is connected to the Library via 2 Hinges. You place one large Dark Grey 8 x 16 Baseplate which you then start building a wall with arched windows and a small arched doorway. You Build a small Bookshelf which has a Green Potions Book, A Red Herbology Book and A Black Dark Sorcery Book. The Bookshelf is actually a tilting mechanism which from the outside allows you to tilt the Bookshelf forwards creating all the Books to fall of the shelf and fall on to the ground. You make a small Brown Table with a Rare Quantum Purple Magnifying Glass suspended in a Light Grey Cylindrical Piece. You also slide a small secret compartment underneath the table which has a very small white Flat Tile with a Small Blue Book on it with small Gold Stars coming out of it. Next to that you build a Spiral Staircase and numerous arched pieces supporting the second floor.&nbsp;<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Second Floor:</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gryffindor Common Room:</span> </span>The Second Floor consists of the Gryffindor Common Room and Balcony. You have a Dark Grey 8 x 16 Base plate which at the Left Hand side you place a Light Grey Turning Door which has a Printed Picture of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Fat Lady</span> asking for the Password hehe. You then build a Gryffindor Knight who actually is a proper Mini-figure. You create a small curved wall section and place the Gryffindor Knight on a stand which behind him is a secret Rare Trans-Cyan Blue Diamond. You then build a small Balcony section which I really like. It has a small Trans Fire Flame peice and it has enough room for some Mini-figures to stand and look out of the view or the Enchanting Stars at night. <br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Third Floor:</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Small Mechanism:</span></span> The third floor isn't much except for a small mechanism that links to the second floor. On the second floor you place a sort of lever or switch. On the Third Floor you build a small secret compartment with 2 Jars on top 1 Red Cylindrical Piece with a Trans-Clear Stud on top and 1 Yellowish-Green Trans Cylindrical peice with a Blue Stud on top both resembling Potions, Jars or Lollie Jars. You then connect a Brown Chain to the top of the Compartment to the Switch on the Second Level. Now when you tilt the Switch on the second level back the compartment lid opens up to reveal a Gold Key which you place in earlier. <br></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fourth Floor:</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Astronomy Tower:</span></span> And last of all the Astronomy Tower. It's basically a Telescope Structure with a Plain Cyan Blue Book which inside it contains a Trans-Blue Flat Tile (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Which shows some Gold Stars all over it</span>) in a small formation next to the Telescope. And a large Green Roof structure over the Telescope and a Dark Grey Flag to finish it off.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Gryffindor Tower is very Tall and impressive when finished. If you didn't understand a section of the set, simply Download the Instructions from Bricklink.com or Peeron.com. Or go to Peeron.com for a complete comprehensive Inventory of the set and all it's pieces. <br></p><p><br></p><h4>Great Hall:</h4><br>This is by far one of my Favourite Parts of the Castle. You start of with 1, 1 x18 and 1, 8 x 8 Dark Grey Base Plate which you connect together to create one large Baseplate. You then build a sort of Rock formation leading to the starting windows of the Great Hall. On the far Right of the Great Hall you Build Dumbledore's Throne which is Purple and Yellow. Underneath his Throne there is a mechanism which allows you to tilt the Throne Forwards and reveals a Plain Grey Key and a Flat Tile with a Brown Sack that has a Black Spider and a Bone with Gold Stars coming out of it. You also build a Brown Table and small Brown Bench which can sit 3 people Maximum. On the Brown Table there is 2 Yellow Goblet Drinking Cups and a Printed Envelop on a Flat Tile piece. You now place the Albus Dumbledore Sticker on a Black Flat Tile and place it on the bench provided. In the middle of the Great Hall you start building a large Fireplace which looks very warm and welcoming. You place 2 Black Flat Tiles which you slid a small compartment on which inside has a Magenta Diamond and a Brown LEGO Tile on top with 4 Orange studs resembling Fire. You place a fully custom Fireplace peice which is attached to a Hinge. Enabling you to open and shut the Fireplace so that Peeves can hide in there. You then place 2 Large Tan Pillars and more numerous arches and window formations. You eventually place 2 Trans-Clear LEGO pieces which at the end of you place 2 Orange Flame pieces resembling the floating Candles. You place more half curved arched pieces which resemble the classic antique roof. Above this you start building the Roof. On the bottom of the Roof you place a Trans-Green Cylinder piece and a Clear Dome over it making it look all strange and abstract, I'm not sure what the Green Piece is sadly. You then place 4 Sloped Light Grey pieces and 2 Black Plates 2 x 2 with Towball which enable you to connect the Roof. The Roof Tiles aren't actually LEGO, they are a Cardboard material which when you receive them (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">If you buy the set in a New Sealed Box or they owner hasn't Built the set</span>) you will notice 1 hole in both of the 2 Roof Tile Cardboard piece you receive. You push the Carboard out of the Hole so now you have a small hole. You then push the hole over the 2 x 2 Black piece which has a Round Ball type LEGO piece that goes through the Hole, keeping the Roof Tiles secure and Neat. You then finish with some decorative Triangle type Tan pieces, A Cute Black Bat and a small Tower structure on the top of the Great Hall. <br><br><h4>A word of Warning:</h4><br>One thing I noticed in this set is, If you buy this set in New Condition do be a bit Cautious. The Tile Roof pieces are not LEGO so they can get Bent or stained, be very careful. Also the Giant Fireplace piece is extremely vulnerable to scratches considering the front if it is completely glossy and shiny. Also Capes, You can Iron them slightly if they are bent however don't Iron them for to long because if you Iron them for to long the small fabric on the Cape starts to flick out and so you don't have that nice clean cut edge that you have when you get a fresh new cape. So just be cautious and careful when buying this set in Used Condition. <br><br><h4>Overall:</h4><br>Fantastic, Just a Fantastic set. I strongly recommend this set to anyone with full confidence that you will enjoy it. It truly is a Marvelous set and is worth every bit of money paid for, A true Master Piece and Complete Triumph! 5/5<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review. <br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></span></span>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-18T09:56:10.09Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Hogwarts Castle Review","This castle is very exciting and I love the way how LEGO did the playabilities. This castle is not that detailed as the 2010 version but it's still awsome. You also can't complain about the number of minifigs which we get in this model. This set includes 9 minifigs in total. It comes with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Draco Malfoy, Hagrid, Albus Dumbledore, Severus Snape, a knight statue and a ghost who is supposed to be Peeves. The bags of this set are numbered for an easy build.<br><br>The build is awsome and the whole castle is very sturdy. We get a boat, a little gate a building with the big room where the students and teachers are eating which got a chimney, a place where you can hide the ghost behind the rock on the top of the chimney, a box where you can hide some stuff in the inside and a sviwel card which shows you a picture of Dumbledore. We also get a flag which has a sticker for the house gryffindor and the house slytherin on each side. You also can hide some stuff under Dumbledore's chair.<br><br>The other building has a library and the room for the gryffindor with the picute which is supposed to be the entrance. This picture is a sticker which you have to put on a sviwel wall piece. There's also a spiral stair which is nice about this set. I really can't complain about the stuff which we get in this set.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
