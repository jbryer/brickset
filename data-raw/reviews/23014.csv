My children have been having a lot of fun with the motorcycle and enjoy playing pretend hide and seek with the crook and his wall.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing fancy a little booklet explains the very simple build for the figures, the background element and the motorcycle.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>38 parts all of them fairly common it seems. Though I had not touched a Lego in years until I got this little set I was amazed by the actual &quot;brick&quot; texture pieces and the crowbar. Those were new for me.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 very nice figures are included. I particularly like the patrol officer with this silver shades. The crook looks grizzled and his facial expression makes him seem like he might even be the leader of a tough bunch of Lego crooks. Very nice prints on both of them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple to build with less than 40 parts. But it took my little ones a bit to plow through it. But they figured it out. It was fun to watch them put it together.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The bike looks sleek! I am tempted to get another if only so that the play value increases because the crook being on foot makes for very short chases.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It is a nice set for kids who might be getting into the bigger police sets and such. This will increase your population and give you a nice piece of police hardware to boot. Not bad for the price.&nbsp;</p>
