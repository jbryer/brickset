"Robatron86","2014-12-01T13:23:40.6Z","Great kit with the Swoosh factor","<p>This kit is very impressive, with over 500 pieces, and a lot of playability. I picked this kit up for &pound;40 in a sale.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is long and thin, and would not be big enough to hold the completed model. 4 numbered booklets, book 1 covers the pickup and 2 of the minfigs,&nbsp;&nbsp;book 2 the hideout and the other 3&nbsp;minifigs. Books 3 and 4 cover the helicopter build.</p>

<p>The instructions are printed in the usual&nbsp;style, with the stickers not protected or tucked into any of the booklets in my set.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Lots of &quot;classic&quot; parts (1x2x4&nbsp;blocks, the window bays, the wheels), stuff I remember from my childhood. There are&nbsp;a few custom parts, the blades for example. A lot of parts very useful to MOCers (large and long plates)</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The minifigs are nicely printed, and I believe unique to this set. The pilot is wearing some nice Aviator glasses! The criminals are in the classic striped prison garb, and look typically cartoonish&nbsp;with scars and beards/stubble.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The pickup is a very straight foward build, but makes a nice little vehicle, very helpful for fleshing out a City scene.</p>

<p>The hideout building is good little structure, very solid once built, and has some nice play features such as an opening door and a sliding door. There is also a safe inside the building, which contains the gold&nbsp;bars and the $100 bills (the only printed item in the set). The safe can be opened and closed (I believe it is a repainted post box from decades ago as it has slots that you can post the money and gold bars through).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actual building is a little thought intensive, as the bricks have to go a certain way round (to portray house bricks) and in a certain order. This may bore young builders.</p>

<p>The final part is the helicopter, the real gem in the set. A lot of stickers involved, and some can be very awkward (the 06 on the nose or the &quot;Police&quot; across the tail). Maybe a job for an adult, but that has always been the way, especially when I was younger. My dad always did mine! The kit has a surprising weight to it and is cleverly designed to use as many standard components as possible. The build is nicely broken up to be challenging but engaging.</p>

<p>Again some nice playability. There is a sliding door on the left side and a folding ramp at the back. They also provide a &quot;knotted&quot; rope so you can re-enact the classic hero pose of hanging on from the helicopter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do have a couple of minor complaints with the finished item.</p>

<p>The wheels are so small. They look like they will collapse under the weight.</p>

<p>Above the cockpit screen are 2 gaps, designed to lift the roof off to add and remove the pilot, but it looks ugly and I&#39;m sure a simple solution exists to improve it.</p>

<p>Above the tail ramp is the construction to attach the tail rotor. In one place it is only one plate thick, it isn&#39;t a problem&nbsp;from a structural&nbsp;point of view, but when compared to the chunkiness of the rest of the model, it comes across as looking a bit odd.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The completed models look great together, and they are sturdy enough to withstand a great deal of playtime abuse.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a good kit. 5 minifigs, a pretty sizeable helicopter, the pickup and hideout represent good value for money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A fair amount of playability for kids, and for the AFOL, plenty of scope with display ideas. I found I could modify mine with a Power Functions motor to spin the blades, although space inside is quite cramped.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend this kit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A nice set, with the&nbsp;massive helicopter being the main attraction. And let&#39;s be honest, the only reason to consider buying this set is the helicopter The helicopter itself is big, perhaps even a little too big in size for smaller children to easily handle; on the other hand, it is surprisingly light for its size. The surveilling police officer in the barrel&nbsp;is a nice addition. The hide-out and car are rather generic. I am conflicted about it being proper value for money - 60&nbsp;euro&#39;s is a bit steep, but if you can get it on a discount (I found&nbsp;it for 20% off at Bricklink) it is definitely worth it.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Warning for sticker haters: there is a decent number of stickers, quite a few being of the dreaded transparent background variety. As usual&nbsp;for me, Windex&nbsp;went a long way to get that sorted out.</p>

<p>The build is fairly easy. The truck and the criminal hide-out can be built in 5-10 minutes each. The helicopter takes a bit longer (and four bags) but could be built within 30-40 minutes as well. Most interesting is the construction of the nose of the helicopter, centered around a black&nbsp;4x2x2&nbsp;studs-on-top-and-two-sides block. The massive front window is also a nice piece. Although initially - during construction - it looks like the helicopter will be rather clunky, in the end the result&nbsp;does not look that way. The designer made good use of older existing pieces, and some new ones (mostly centered around the air intakes, exhausts and the noze).</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>To me the minifigures are nothing special. Five&nbsp;are included: three&nbsp;police officers (surveillance officer, regular street cop, and a pilot), and two criminals (one in striped shirt, another one in a less obvious striped shirt covered by a black leather jacket). I would have liked to see a few more, as&nbsp;one actually needs more police officers/crew to properly man the helicopter - an additional pilot, and preferably two extra crew members at least.</p>

<h2>The builds</h2>

<p>The car is nice, green and in looks a dime a dozen. Similarly looking (but different coloured) cars have been included in other sets.&nbsp;It is serves well for replaying a chase, and would also serve nicely to fill out a Lego City display.</p>

<p>The criminal&#39;s hide out is in itself a nice little build, but in many ways just too small. The car cannot fit inside the garage, for instance. The inclusion of a small strong box (made from an old mail box) is very nice, as is the inclusion of money and gold brick pieces. It is clear that it is included in the set to provide a target for the police surveillance (especially the guy in the barrel).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helicopter is the absolute star&nbsp;of the set. To me&nbsp;its appeal is in its size&nbsp;as well as the fact that it is unique for any Lego police helicopter (or even any police helicopter in the real world) or any Lego helicopter in general in the Lego City line. It has the looks of a major army or navy transport helicopter (a mixture of the venerable S-61R Sea King Search and Rescue helicopter and the CH-53 Sea Stallion heavy transport helicopter) that has been repainted in police colours. As mentioned, for its size it is surprisingly light in weight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note, BTW, how in real life it is unlikely that these helicopters would be used in surveillance anyway - much too big, and above all, much too loud.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Display vs play</h2>

<p>This set is above all a play set. The helicopter begs to be swooshed around, hunting down a fleeing car, with cops rappelling down from it in the end (the appropriate rope is included). As a stand alone, the helicopter is a nice display piece, though the size of its rotors causes it to take up quite a bit of space&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>This is a nice set, with a whole lot of potential, and that IMHO could have been much better. As it is, it feels as if it is somewhat incomplete - the hide-out is too small and there are not enough minifigures included to properly&nbsp;crew the helicopter. On the other hand, I can see why it has come to this, as these upgrades would have significantly increased the price of the set. As such, I think Lego made the right choice: it makes for a unique helicopters still being (somewhat) affordable for many people, and the missing crew and pieces for the crook&#39;s hide-out expansion might be grabbed from other sets or the spares box. Overall, I think this is a nice set that - although at the expensive end - is probably&nbsp;still worth its price; if it can be found at a discount, it is even better.&nbsp;</p>
