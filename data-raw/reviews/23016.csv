<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Recommended age range 6-12 (Well that really depends on the individual. My 4 year old&nbsp;built this will only a little guidance.)</p>

<p>Big Box with fun scenes on the back that&nbsp;really captured my sons imagination, he carried it home on public transport, thoroughly inspecting&nbsp;the&nbsp;images the whole way.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">I bought this set for my 4.5 year old son in </span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">June 2014</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">when it&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">was on sale in Australia for AU$95.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;"">He&nbsp;was able to build the entire set with only minimal hands-off guidance by me, and he only found&nbsp;the tall pillars at the rear on the main office, a little unstable when building the second story over them, and some help with the many stickers.</span></p>

<p>My son built this over 2 days spending about an hour at a time, probably 3 hours in total, not bad for a 4.5 year old boy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure it would have ony been a 1 hour max &nbsp;build for an adult.</p>

<p>This seemed like a fun build, not much repetition, with fun little details popping up to surprise my son.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Up to 3 stories in height, with 4 vertical levels of play (including roof tops) it is a big set for the money, and really worth it.<br />
3 x sections join together to make the station: so moving / storing the entire set is made easier as it is modular.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The exterior is great with all those windows this could be great with a light kit.<br />
The interiors of the office are well laid out, though they are a little cramped for big fingers without removing floor levels, but&nbsp;children&#39;s&nbsp;fingers have little problem setting figures to work in the given space. the doors on the ground floor are a bit awkward as the open inwards and create some dead space within the office, but this could be&nbsp;modified.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Some nice details in the office with prisoner processing systems (camera and computers with desks) and the water cooler and coffee machine were a treat adding some interesting opportunities for the figures to take a break from police work. We made some small modifications to the chairs we put a 4x4 stud swivel plate under the office chairs just for better access and poses.<br />
There is a&nbsp;heli-pad&nbsp;on the roof giving 3 levels of play.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><img alt=""Lego 60047 Police coffee break"" src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ID7c5THRIOA/U6fNHH_Q-ZI/AAAAAAAA1yA/gXu3M2vZic8/w2093-h1178-no/20140623_164439.jpg"" style=""width: 523px; height: 294px;"" /></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">&quot;COFFEE BREAK!&quot;</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The cell block: 4 levels including the rooftop, 2 cell block levels and ground floor security entrance. So much fun to be had here, with all mod-cons; toilets &amp; beds and basin with taps.<br />
There are hidden trap doors from roof top through the cell block, where the toilets fall though, and the crooks make their escape right into the driveway with the boom gate.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">There is a Walkway from the helipad on the office that gives acces to the cells and links the 3 building modules for minifigure access. (although there are no stairs linking any levels)<br />
The bars of 4 windows on the 2 levels can be pulled out by the tow truck so the escape can be made that way too.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The Air Traffic Control tower sits high above the Satellite&nbsp;coms&nbsp;dish, perched on top&nbsp;of the Roll-a-door Garage which can house either the Pursuit Car or the Highway Patrol Motorcycle without removing driver or rider, making for quick entry and exit from the garage.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This Police station is a great addition for any Lego fan, young or old. Cool layout, with some really great playable&nbsp;features.&nbsp;</p>

"Monkeyman3838","2015-04-02T16:16:39.377Z","Great set, although it could've used some things...","

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>HUGE BOX. It is quite heavy, and had 10, I&nbsp;REPEAT 10 bags. The first bag built the motorcycle and some of the minifigures, second bag built the two cars, and the third built the helicopter. 6 instruction manuals, which is a lot, and I would&#39;ve preferred the one, thickly bound book. On to the parts!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Okay parts. It had the ball and chains, which are pretty cool, has a camera, but it has A TON of stickers. There are tons of great window pieces for MOCing. There is a new grappling hook piece, which is great, because it is molded like this:#6055312 On to the minifigures!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is probably the strongest part of the set. The minifigures are astounding. the one who drives the red truck is my favorite, as his torso and head are awesome! However, he&#39;s supposed to have a bag of money on his back, but he can&#39;t fit in the truck when it&#39;s on! The two jailbirds are also very well made, with the same striped shirt as always. Some new torsos fo the policemen, also. On to the build!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really great, took me about an hour. The instructions were straightforward and easy to follow, which makes it great for younger builders. The helicopter landing pad is awesome, as is the mug shot place! The garage is also great! The red truck, however, NEEDS TO BE WIDER. You can&#39;t even fit the other robbers in the back of it, so it&#39;s kinda pointless.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s great! It&nbsp;goes great in a city, and fits together with just about everything.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Amazing, Lego. You once again blew me away with a set that has been produced for many years now, but this one may be the best. The crown jewel. The cream of the crop. The head honcho. I&#39;m done now.</p>

"Scott1","2016-10-25T17:39:26.453Z","One of the Best Police Stations so Far","<p>I bought two of these in order to make a modular modern&nbsp;police station. This set is one of the best sets for making one, as there are plenty of blue and white&nbsp;wall pieces, and plenty of windows. Today I&#39;ll be reviewing one set, and seeing how it stands up in comparison to other police stations.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is pretty big, and there are ten bags inside. There&nbsp;are six&nbsp;instruction manuals; I would have preferred one or two big ones, but six is okay too, as it makes it easier for younger kids.&nbsp;Not all Lego fans&nbsp;are AFOL&#39;s anyway!</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts included are perfect for building a modular police station, unlike the Prison Island set, which has mostly rock pieces. Also included are the ball-and-chain parts and a fire engine ladder in LBG, both of which are pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigs are great. I would have liked a few&nbsp;more police officers, however.&nbsp;While the other two officers are&nbsp;in their vehicles,&nbsp;those two&nbsp;officers&nbsp;are supposed&nbsp;to watch the&nbsp;inmates, work in the office, take care of the&nbsp;dog, take care of the cars, and prevent&nbsp;other criminals from breaking out their buddies! No&nbsp;wonder why the&nbsp;crooks are always escaping!</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build was pretty long; it took me&nbsp;two hours&nbsp;and thirty minutes. Most of the time was spent building and not looking for parts, thanks to the separate bags and instructions.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>When finished, it looks great! It doesn&#39;t look that&nbsp;good from the back, but it is a City police station after all, and most people won&#39;t be viewing it from the back.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>This police station is really, really, good. It&#39;s much better than the Prison Island set, in my opinion. It is a perfect set for building police station modulars, especially corner ones. It has a fair assortment of minifigs, but they should have included&nbsp;more for the price point.&nbsp;For some reason,&nbsp;the price seems off. I don&#39;t really know why,&nbsp;but&nbsp;the set&nbsp;seems a little bit&nbsp;pricey. Maybe it&#39;s the&nbsp;small amount of minifigs for $100, maybe it&#39;s the lack of a proper baseplate, I don&#39;t know. It just seems off. Luckily I got mine for $70 each, and I feel that&#39;s a fair price. If you find this set for under $90 or so, I would definitely recommend it.</p>

"markliso","2017-11-13T21:32:09.74Z","Police Station Fun","<p>This set is great fun.&nbsp; You get multiple mini figs, multiple vehicles and fun and unique build experience.&nbsp; Got this for 100 bucks (Canadian)&nbsp;at Costco and well worth the money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some unique features are already pictured, with the little&nbsp;tow truck that can blow open the jail.&nbsp; The jail cells have some unique designs as well (counting down the days on the walls and toilets).&nbsp; Love the little parking garage arm and the booth for an attendant.&nbsp; Overall, it&#39;s a decent design and lots of fun.&nbsp; Reminds me of when I played with the stations as a kid.</p>

"simpleatom","2020-12-04T19:36:16Z","An amazing set for play and display.","<p>The Lego Group is amazing. They make absolute amazing sets with incredible detail,&nbsp;but like any good thing, we will always have some issues with it. A common one with the tiny sub-community&nbsp;in the Lego community who are not Star Wars freaks (99.99% of the community) and actually like City is that they make too many police sets. This seems to date back to 2011 (as far as I could find). But as always, there is a good reason. These sets sell incredible. This one was No. 3 on the best-selling sets of 2015! However, we were spoiled with amazing police sets back in the day and didn&#39;t even know it. The 2020 police wave is... well... yeah... what the heck happened to the police station?</p>

<p>But all issues aside, this is a cool set. This is a city set, so it will always be made for kids. But they did seem to care about TFOLS and AFOLS&nbsp;on this one compared to the 2020 police station. It has a very modern design and you get a lot for the piece count.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s first look at the figures. 3 criminals and two 4 police officers The heads are nothing special. None of the heads were new at the time, but they were recent. All the hats are very old&nbsp;except for the new police cap piece. It&#39;s a recolour from the CMF police officer in dark blue. The leg parts are all unprinted and of very little interest. There are some accessories for both teams but the best part of the figures are the torsos. Apart from one, ALL of the torsos were new at the time. There is also a dog.</p>

<p>This is a city police station, so they definitely will include some vehicles. The first one we will talk about is the police car. This is based on the 4-stud City chassis and fits very well with other City cars. The design is very simple but works really well. It&#39;s a bit weird how it doesn&#39;t fit 2 passengers like 4436, but it has some space to store some tools. It&#39;s a very nice and simple build.</p>

<p>The second one is a motorcycle. This one is based on the standard motorcycle fairing for the time and has some clips to store some tools. There is not much to talk about here.</p>

<p>The third one is a helicopter. This is a small helicopter is a nice build and uses some rather unorthodox&nbsp;techniques for City to construct the tail. It has some little cabinets to put some tools.</p>

<p>The fourth has been a standard for police stations, but this is the set was the first modern one to include a huge improvement: a getaway vehicle. These can also be used as regular civilian vehicles. This made playability for this set much better. This one is a red tow truck with&nbsp;a hook which relates to a play feature I will talk about later. Around the same size as the police car and also uses the 4-stud wide chassis.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s talk about the main build of this set, which is obviously the police station. This one is split into 3 main parts: Headquarters, Jail and Garage. The headquarters is a square building with a very nice design. The building is one giant cube, but one of the corners is missing. This makes for a nice corner-building style design. The windows have a really beautiful line pattern and the street is decorated with a fire hydrant, a street lamp and a patch of grass. The first floor interior is a waiting room which has a desk with a computer and a computer, as well as some seating. The second floor has a mug shot wall, another desk with a computer, a tool rack&nbsp;and a water dispenser. You can access the jail using the bridge from the headquarters, which we will talk about now.</p>

<p>The jail is a 2-storey building with lots of play features. The jail cells have lots of detail in the interior and stickers emulate drawings on the walls. The jail cells do not have doors but have windows which apart from the middle one, have no stud connection on the top. This is to use the tow truck I talked about earlier&nbsp;to break off the bars so the prisoners can escape. There are two other ways to escape. You could use the toilet to get to the second garage or you could find a crowbar under the bed to open a hatch on top of the building. Speaking of the garage, there is a small garage under the jail. It also has a lifting barrier for security.</p>

<p>The smallest part of the station is a garage with security tower. The garage uses the standard roll-up door piece and there is a large radar dish on top of it. There is also a little trash can next to the garage. The tower is simple but does the job effectively. This small tower has a tool rack (identical to the one in the headquarters) and the top floor has a rotating seat, radar and coffee mug. It also has a siren on top of it. That&#39;s it for the overview.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience: Fairly large parts occasionally but this set is a very enjoyable build.</p>

<p>Parts: Again, occasional large parts but lots of useful parts including the new prints, the ball and chain piece and very blocky and generic pieces that are easy and useful to build with</p>

<p>Playability: Absolutely incredible! Lots of storytelling possibilities and very nice play features!</p>

<p>Value for money: Even though parts sometimes can be large, the PPP is fantastic, but it earned a spot on the 60132 Wall of Shame</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is a very good-looking&nbsp;set that is good for play, but it&#39;s design is so good that it is definetly a set you should get if you want to display it in a city. I 100% recommend this set.</p>
