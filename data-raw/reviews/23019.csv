And with this Lone Ranger's Tonto it does add something only LEGO and Disney can achieve, a little magic. It's nice to have. I like it because I love Western theme's and the mysterious Tonto played by Johnny Depp. If you want one, just buy it. If you think it's too expensive, just don't.",FALSE,3,1,1,1,3
