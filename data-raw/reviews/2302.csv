This was actually my second Harry Potter set and it's a good thing they were able to come up with the remembrall chase scene. I bought this in order to acquire the two major characters in the novel. Really nice indeed! A perfect five for this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"wolfercdat","2007-11-28T22:54:54.84Z","What's With the Remembrall","I thought this set was only O.K. and would have been impressed if it had come with Professor Hooch.  What I can't understand is how the characters are supposed to hold the remembrall.  Any ideas out there?  I don't see anything in the instructions or in the photos but it's obvious they're supposed to be able to hold it and yet the opening is too small for their hands to fit inside.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Set is inexpensive to buy and with Malfoy in it, its a cheap way to obtain him without getting another $20+ set. Collection building purchase - well worth it for me.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-10-18T00:32:30.56Z","Potter vs. Malfoy","This is a classic example of a rivalry type of set. There is Harry, Draco, 2 brooms, and some Quidditch supplies. The Golden Snitch is in a glass case which is a little odd but it's still good. 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-25T15:53:49.077Z","Flying Lesson","this set is from the Harry Potter theme and was released in the year of 2002. This is a small set and have no much features. The two minifigures included are Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. The both are good designed and sometimes, looks like the characters of the movie in a lego style. The both also have covers and the original lego brooms. They cannot ride very well on it but it still cool when they are with it. The little cart is good builted but notfeatures much action and not stay well without some minifigure carrying it. The crystal ball is jus a crystal ball but it is like other from old sets, so, still cool but with no much new features. Altough the set is not much playable and have few pieces, this is a good small set and can increase something in other Harry Potter sets. So, i rate the &quot;Flying Lesson&quot; 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

That is Neville's Rememberall. You have to have seen the movie to understand. Overall this is a stupid set and it is not worth buying.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jhh7487","2008-09-15T16:11:01.75Z","Flying Lessons","My favorite part about this set is the teeny instruction booklet. Awesome to have 2 more broomsticks though, and I like to keep all the minifigures with the set they came in so I don't really mind if I will eventually have 30 Harry's. My remembrall has been on Draco's hand since i got this set in 02, never been a problem. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Basically, what you get are two minifigs (capes), broomsticks, cool ball thing (Snitch? I can't remember), and a little barrel. I would not buy it. Although It's got some helpful pieces, I'm glad I got it for free. The only reason you would buy it, is to get the minifigs.

"woodall_aidan","2010-08-05T21:10:55.41Z","The Only Rememberall!","This was a very cool set. The Rememberall was the main point of the set, I must say. I liked the fact that it came with that little cart ( just so the set does not seem too small ). I kind of liked the design of Draco Malfoy, with the stern look, instead of a smirk, like the Draco in Hogwarts Castle, 3rd edition. The value was about right, it did not cost much, as well as it did not have that many pieces. It also had the Harry we all know and love, the original yellow-faced smiley guy. Overall, this set deserves a stunning 5/5&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,4,2,3,4
"J0rgen","2010-12-01T11:39:30.417Z","""Give it here Malfoy!""","<p>This is&nbsp;probably the worst Harry Potter set ever made. Even though it has the remembral, the only reason to get this set actually, it does not have too much else... I had nearly all the Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone sets, thus I already had both the Harry Potter and the Draco Malfoy-minifigures. Had this set been released in 2001, with the rest of the Philosopher's Stone sets, it would have been a great way to get Malfoy, as the only set to get him at that point was in the rather expensive 4709 Hogwarts Castle. However, this set was released in 2002, when there were Malfoy's all over the place, in Chamber of Secrets, Malfoy plays a larger role and therefore was in&nbsp;more sets. Since neither of the minifigures were exclusive, there wasn't any real reason to get the set. Except for the remembral.</p>
<p>As readers of the book will know, the remembral belonged to Neville Longbottom(I'm writing that in the past-tense because I believe it's mentioned that he lost it at some later point) and as LEGO-enthusiasts will know, Neville Longbottom was not released until the Prisoner of Azkaban set 4752-Professor Lupin's Classroom. Had Neville Longbottom been in this set, it would have been a lot better. As it was, there wasn't any real reason to get it, unless it was your first Harry Potter set and you had neither of the figures, nor any broomsticks.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,4

"AETerry","2010-10-25T16:43:48.667Z","Flying Lesson - Rememberall!","<p>2002 - That was a bad year for me and LEGO, mainly as there just weren't very many sets out that I wanted. At the time, I wasn't too interested in having many or any Harry Potter sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this set comes as a Stocking Stuffer gift, so that wasn't too bad and soothed my bruised ego that somehow I was ""loosing interest in legos"" as I hadn't bought many that year and provided some fun for the few moments it took to put it together.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed, looking in other reviews and back at older HP sets, that this is indeed the only HP set to feature Neville's Rememberall. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's small, two minifigures, brooms and a cart that they attach too and the Rememberall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn't bad and I'm rather glad I do have it now as this year 2010, I am seeing some HP sets I do want to get.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,5
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-10T16:11:33.51Z","Remembrall and Harry","<p>Set #4711 Flying Lesson: This little impulse set from the Harry Potter Theme is an interesting choice for a small set, it gives you yet another Harry Potter Mini-Figure, a Draco Malfoy, a small broom holding cart, two brooms and the Remembrall accessory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all there's little else to say about this set, it has very few pieces, you don't build much, and there are no wands for the two Mini-Figures. But it is definitely a fun little set to play with and it is the only way to get a Remembrall for your custom Neville Longbottom Mini-Figure. (If you have a custom Neville that is.) It is a good deal for your money too, in spite of what you might think, because it is a great source for cheap Gryffindor and Slytherin costumes for Customizing different students of Hogwarts. I'd have to say it's a worthy addition to any Harry Potter collection.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,3,5
