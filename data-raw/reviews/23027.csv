The minifigures&nbsp;fit in with the Winter village theme, and are both overly plain. The only interest point in them are their hats. The man has a new mold for the hat piece in red, and the woman has a new color beanie. Also included is a red scarf around the woman&#39;s neck, but other than that they are for the most part uninteresting. The building is basic, and some nice features are the dark red tiles and hinge bricks. I would also like to note the LEGO&nbsp;dollar, because we can never have enough LEGO money! Some nice pieces included were three small&nbsp;trees which can be used as, well, trees. (Unless you get REALLY creative, their is not much more to do with them) It is a nice little set, although once it is built, all you really can do is make the woman by a whole bunch of trees...because we all know one person needs three trees...</p>

<p>Over-all it is a nice little set with great pieces and not much play value. The fact that there are two minifigures&nbsp;in a free set makes it an even better, but even with one it would still be a great piece to have in any city!</p>
