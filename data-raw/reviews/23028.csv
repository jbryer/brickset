<p>Apparently, this was a freebie offer with qualifying purchase during the 2013 Christmas season. &nbsp;My wife bought the set from eBay and I&#39;m glad she did! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing special here. &nbsp;Lives up to LEGO&#39;s standards.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard fare. &nbsp;No new parts that I can tell. &nbsp;However, the color scheme is very nice and the truck looks great. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifig is a grey&nbsp;haired fella (like me!) with nice blue/gray&nbsp;coveralls. &nbsp;He wheels the handtruck around nicely&nbsp;and the two fit together very well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The truck uses a technique for vehicles that I haven&#39;t seen before or since. &nbsp;It truly is built up. &nbsp;There are no formed chassis parts except for the axles. &nbsp;I like that the truck is a true brick build and not just a chassis assembly. &nbsp;The grill is very attractive and fun to build using the SNOT (Studs Not On Top)&nbsp;technique. &nbsp;The truck rolls effortlessly. &nbsp;I very much enjoy this build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Nice lines, proportions and colors. &nbsp;Looks great when completed!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great addition to any Christmas collection. Highly recommended.</p>
