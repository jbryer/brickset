[That statement only holds true if you do not consider the Castle Theme trolls to be like the old one's.] Yet this set also includes a sink, door, pumpkin head, another Harry Potter, (my twentieth Harry)and a cool little arch over all of it.

Troll-pieces only in this set

Taps-looks real

Cons-
Door hinge-is weak
Trap-pieces fall straight down, nor forward
Bathroom-Doesn't look like it does in the movie

"J0rgen","2010-08-15T10:17:55.87Z","TROLL! TROLL IN THE DUNGEONS!","<p>This set is a classic, I got it for my birthday back in '01 or '02, I remember having a lot of fun with this one as the scene is one of the most memorable from ""Philosopher's Stone"". There are some smashing functions, the sink bends and there's a function that makes some pieces of ""wood"" fall from the ceiling, to recreate the troll's rampage. This set goes well with 4735 ""Slytherin"", since the polyjuice potion was made in a bathroom. It did'nt fit with the rest of the castle, like most the Harry Potter sets did back then, but it did go on top of ""Slytherin"" and they could be placed alongside the rest of the castle, so it was allright. Since this is a small set, and the troll is a very big minifigure(oh the irony!), so they just included one other figure, and that was Harry. This set could have contained both Hermione and Ron as well, but to expect that would be ridiculous. They all play important rolls in the scene; Hermione is the reason they came there, but she does'nt do too much, besides screaming. Ron is the one who defeats the troll in the end, by the clever use of wingardium leviosa. Harry does his share in the fight, sticking his wand in the troll's nose, so they went for him as the minifig for this set. And I think it was ok, we had so many of them all, anyway. If you did'nt have a lot of Harry Potter sets, I would guess Harry'd be&nbsp;the figure you'd want.</p>

"mngoult","2010-01-06T07:18:29.577Z","Oh dear, at least the troll is nice.","Straight from the book/film another action Harry Potter set. The set builds a small bathroom with sink, washing bowl and a door.

A couple of thing woory me about this set, firstly: why is it built on a normal plate and why is that plate brown? Secondly: what on earth is that weird arch brick at the top and why the pumpkin head on top? (if memory serves it was around Hallowen when this scene features but why is it in the bathroom).

There is also an odd but functional hinge section which allows you to drop bricks on the trolls head should you feel that way inclined. Not a good effort from lego, another one just for the collectors or if you want to pick up a troll. Three stars for this set (the troll contributes two of those btw).

Pros
Troll figure (thats it)

Cons
Brown floor.
Only Harry (again) where are Hermy and Ron?
Ugly arch at the top.
Hinge section that has no place in this set and doesn't fit in with book or film.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The jack-o-lantern head kind of cool, as it is unique to this set. Collapsing sink is also a nice touch (you don't find many of those!). Doorway is kind of useless, since it does not really lead anywhere else. The troll wearing its vest and loincloth is great (very realistic, is it not?), only set to get them both in.

What I think was interesting about this troll is that you can dress this creature with a vest and some shorts.

The door does open and there's also a washbowl which can sviwel. On the top you can also see a platform with two brown rocks which you can drop on the troll.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-10T16:20:51.07Z","TROLL! TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!","<p>Set #4712 Troll on the Loose: A small set without much to comment on, but a definite must own for any Harry Potter collectors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troll on the Loose includes a fairly smallish model with pieces to build a girl's bathroom... Or at least part of one. There are of course no toilets, just a few arches, a sink with a couple of unique pieces to make it, a gimmicked section of the cieling designed to drop bricks onto the Troll's head, a door with two gray keys and of course the only Troll Mini-Figure ever made (so far). This doesn't count the Fantasy Era Troll's because we're talking Harry Potter not Castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model was meant to attach to others to build up Hogwarts, I believe it was meant to be on the top, but I could be wrong about that. Either way it isn't a very practical set for combining with Hogwarts due to the limited number of pieces in the build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, overall this set is a must have item, even with another Harry Mini-Figure, because without it you won't have the titular Troll for your Harry Potter Mini-Figure collection, and all Harry Potter fans need the Troll. The club is rather interesting looking too once built, it's just such a shame that you can only move one arm and turn the head on this figure, I feel that LEGO might be well advised to re-introduce this particular Mini-Figure with a bit of updated articulation. And oh yes, though you can't see it in the picture, this set also included a Mini-Figure head in orange with black to represent a Jackolantern placed on the top of the bridge section. A must have item for any LEGO enthusiast who enjoys unique looking Mini-Figure heads.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
