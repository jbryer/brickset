So after looking around for a while a found some on Amazon.com and picked up a few, and am quite pleased with what I got.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>The hairpiece on this figure is the same as in the Collectible Minifigure Sleepyhead, including the color of his hair, that being reddish-brown, which looks quite nice on him IMO.</div><div><br></div><div>The printing on his head is actually new, which is one, among other reasons, to pick up this polybag. With his rather wide smile which curves up in one corner and a slightly raised eyebrow, he has a rather mischievous expression really. New faces are always welcome!</div><div><br></div><div>Now for the torso, my favorite piece, mainly because of the printing on his arms, which is something I have a bit of a soft spot for. The torso is black with two grey stripes running along the bottom and another two across each shoulder. There is also a name-tag printed on the upper-right corner of his shirt.</div><div><br></div><div>The legs are nothing special, just plain black legs, moving on...</div><div><br></div><div>There is also a standard red 2x4 btrick included to go with the Minifigure, as seen at Lego Shop@Home. again, nothing special, but no complaints either.</div><h4>Summary</h4><div>This is an excellent Minifigure, definitely worth picking it up if you find it for a reasonable price. A must have for any 'exclusives' collector.</div><p>Overall - 9/10 (I would have given it 10/10 if it had back printing)</p><p><br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5
