The figs are good, Harry is to common, but his shirt is nice and can be used for other figs also.
The car-thing to go to the money of Harry is nice but I would slip this instead of a greater hall ( with more goblins ). All the money pieces are very nice.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"mrmitch","2007-06-09T17:17:09.59Z","Medium sized set with alot cool things to offer","You get Hagrid(another Harry)the Goblins and coins. The bank vault is clever with its own key. The bank is decent sized, and fairly well detailed. Track thing to go to Harry vault is neat-could be longer. This is a very good set, I love the Goblins &amp; Hagrid. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Pros:
Hagrid!
Goblins are neat
Is it just me, or are keys rare now?
I like the vault

Cons:
track could be longer
ANOTHER Harry?!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"JeremyWood","2009-08-01T14:00:25.107Z","Rare and Awesome","This set includes a lot of rare pieces that I am very glad to have, ie. Hagrid's beard, Goblin heads, lots of coins. Although it's not very much like the movie, or even very detailed for that matter, it includes a lot of great pieces and minifigs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ledaKat","2009-10-27T12:43:05.547Z","Worth it for the Goblins","You just gotta get this set for the goblins. They are fantastic figs. A little bit creepy how their faces, ears and hair are all the one colour. Hagrids great too and I love Harry's Muggle clothes.

This set has many excellent aspects and one dumb thing.

This would have worked much better as a smaller, minifig set. Including Harry, Hagrid, two goblins and the mine cart, track and the money vault. Add the owls and the bat and the rat and you've got a nice, compact little set that looks great.
Instead they made it a bigger set by adding a bit of the bank itself. I say a bit, cos its just a tiny bit of it and really doesnt make any sense.  Is it the entrance? Is it inside? Is that the bank manager's desk? Where is the grandeur of Gringotts in that weird little addon of bricks?

To make this set a complete success and worthy of a 5/5 it needs to either A: loose the bank, or B: expand the bank.

I have done both, I had it on display a while without the bank, then I added to the bank with other like colour bricks and made a building more worthy of the goblins that roam its vast corridors. And also made two more money vaults.  But unfortunately, when you have increased the size of the bank then the mine cart and track look too small.

Basicly, I think this set was a great idea that did not quite come out of the production line as good as it could be.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"kaboomlegoman","2010-01-03T17:27:44.043Z","Awesome!","This set is one of the greatest sets I have. Sure, the little cart that the goblin pushes is a little insignificant, but it's great. I just love how the cart thing works. It's a little basic and something that would easily come up in mocs, but all the same it's cool how you push the bar and off they go! My main complaint of this set is that the track should be much longer. But it's fine. The goblin cart is okay, but really, it's kinda insignificant like I said earlier. It has two things in it, some kinda magic thingie and a money bag. The vault isn't really that good, because of the absence if the 1x2 piece that should have gone there. Four coins go inside of it. The bank is the best part. The main desk and can easily separate, Thanks to the use of plates There are two coin storage boxes in there that can open, but don't ask me why. The roof is good, but TLC shouldn't have put another Gringott's sign on the back too. The main point on the roof can open up to reveal four coins inside, but again, don't ask me while there would be coins in storage on the roof. The minifigures are pretty rare. The goblins are only found in this set, and Harry with muggle clothes isn't too common either. I know, Hagrid does appear in some other sets, but he's good. Overall, this is a great set, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it. ( I know this review is long)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-13T02:21:41.423Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Gringott's bank review","This is the first time LEGO made a gringott's bank. It's a good set - even if this doesn't look as detailed as the newer version from the 2011 Diagon Alley set. It comes with a small wagon, a bigger wagon which can hold 3 minifigs, a safe, a track and the bank itself. The door on the safe does open and you can hide the gold in there. The track can be tipped up and down. The big wagon fits on the track and can be launched with a lever we got on the back. The bank isn't also that bad. In fact: it's a good bank. You can take the desk out and there're some small containers where you can put in the money. The two containers on the back of the desk sviwel full 360Â°. We also get two owls in this set.<br><br>This set also has a good value for minifigs. We get Hagrid who comes with a big torso, we get another Harry Potter (this time he got tan pants and a blue sweater), a goblin in a black suit and a goblin with a red suit with brown pants. The goblins don't look as detailed in the movie but they still look very good. The built of this bank is lot's of fun and the set is very sturdy. We also don't need to worry about stickers. This makes the brick 'GRINGOTTS' sign on the top more valuable. This set is a good set to add to your LEGO city for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"woodall_aidan","2011-05-14T18:27:19.54Z","Need your key to get to the vault!","I just got this set, and it truly is awesome! The owls and rat give it a good Diagon Alley feeling. The goblins are brilliant, though they should have added more. The cart and track are just terrific. Being able to take off the front desk is a nice touch. Harry in his muggle clothes is cool and so is Hagrid. This set gets a well-deserved 5/5. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
