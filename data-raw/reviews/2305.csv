Pros: Lots of cool HP-Exclusive pieces

Cons: Could have more minifigs
      Better if it had an interior


Overall its ok. A clear 3.4.

Anyway, as you will have noticed by now, the playablility is greatly hampered by the absence of a seller. On it's own, this set doesn't do it. But if you use other modells's minifigs, this set becomes enjoyable.

Luckily, NO HARRY POTTER! I don't know how many I have, I can do ""HP: attack of the clones"" by now. Instead you get an angry looking malefoy with a nice sweater.

The design of the boutique is simple and effective, it looks pretty good. The lanterns look great and you have an interior with a (printed!) cash machine and a golden piece under a glass. Quiditch balls are held in place with a simple flag. Work fine. Not many play features tough.

The pieces are AMAZING. Rare colors, beautiful printed window, printed flah, pinted EVERYTHING! You get a book, capes, brow!

For it's price it's a really good modell considering all the extras. Piece/price count is just ok, but the great piece choice makes it more than worthy.

Minifigs: 3/5 no seller! Malefoy has a nice sweater, though. And he's yellow. I know you afols love that.

design: 4/5 simple but effective, look great! Playability on its own is not taht good, though.

pieces: 6/5 the pieces are THAT amazing.

Price: 5/5. Worth it.

Final price is about 4/5. Get it if you love sweet pieces ore want to reenact the ""oh! a nimbus 2000"" scene in the movie. Can be good for play if you ad a seller.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-05-02T20:26:37.617Z","Quality Quidditch Supplies","<p>Another E-Bay purchase of mine... I should have gotten this the first time it came out at the $10 mark. That price&nbsp;was well worth it, even comparing it to other sets such as the Mandalorian Battle Pack or the Police Minifigure Pack. Still, a buy it now at $40 vs. high prices of $200+ was worth it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had quite a bit of fun putting this little set together, fast, quick and easy. I wondered for a moment if the age of the set would detract from the details... it doesn't.&nbsp;The Quidditch Balls and Golden Snitch are comparable in appearance to the 2011 Quidditch Match set pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are lots of little details and accessories exclusive to a Harry Potter theme. The Quidditch Balls, Cash Register, brooms, sign, flags, Golden Snitch, Capes, Book. What I would have done differently is to have included a shop keeper with the set. Draco, when I saw him, I thought for a moment I'd been given a Luke Skywalker Minifigure, only with an angry look.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really do like this set, I'm hoping by the end of the year I'll have saved up and gotten around to getting the larger Diagon Alley place set to fit this in with.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
