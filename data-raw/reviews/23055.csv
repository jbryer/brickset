<p>The set comes in a box - which I think is better and greener than the canisters. Instructions for all three models are in one booklet, and are clear.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I never know what to answer to this question - I don&#39;t MOC. I guess the windscreen is pretty cool, and I like the rotating 2x4 that allows the cabin to move around. I usually see this kind of piece in mini helicopter sets.</p>

<p>I like the wheels on these smaller sets better than the ones of bigger creator sets, they spin easier.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Usually with the 3-in-1 creator models, there&#39;s one build that is kind of boring, but for this one they&#39;re all fun! Quick, of course, but I like to build these at work so it&#39;s perfect.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All three models are cute and adorable, which is why I ended up buying a second set with my eyes on a 3rd one so I can display all three models on my desk at once! The digger is cool because the shovel arm has 3 &quot;elbows,&quot; for lack of better term, which means that it can be positioned in many different ways. In addition, the cabin spins and that adds to the fun. The dump truck is also nice, with a bed that can move up and down to dump its content. I put candy in it and dump it on my coworkers desk. The 3rd model, which I might refer to as a bobcat?, is my least favorite but still pretty slick as you can move the big shovel up and down.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna get a 3rd one eventually... :) I love this set.</p>

"Wom","2016-01-16T16:05:14.203Z","I'm digging this one!","<p>Recently I have been buying a lot of these cheap 3-in-1 Creator sets. They are great fun to build and they offer some nice building techniques as well. This little set is no different in this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes in the well known small box which you open via a punch hole. All three models you can build are displayed. On the back side you see a construction site scene using all three possible models.</p>

<p>The hardest part with the construction manual is the fold in the paper. It&#39;s not that easy to lay down the booklet, but this will not prevent you from following instructions. The steps itself are clearly displayed, with only a small amount of bricks per step you need to add. As a result the needed parts are not displayed as you would see with the bigger sets. Not a problem at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The yellow bricks really stand out when you all the bricks before you. Its a nice color which fits the theme perfectly. There are a couple of bricks I&#39;ve never seen before. These are used for the rotation of the cabin, which works like a charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All three models are nice looking and offer great playability thanks to the various moving parts. The digger is the best model for displaying purposes I guess, thanks to the solid shovel arm you can position any way you like.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dumpster and the bobcat are also fun models to play with, but my preference lies with the main model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is another great set in this small Creator series. If you know people working in construction it would make a nice small gift for their desk. You could consider buying multiple sets if you like to display them, all three are worth the build at least.&nbsp;</p>
