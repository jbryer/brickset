My daughter and I (she is 5) have begun building Lego sets together and she absolutely loved doing this one. As it is a 3-in-1 set, all 3 models are different parts of a single train and so we had to buy 3 boxes of this particular set to complete the whole train! I don&#39;t mind as at only &pound;5 per box it wasn&#39;t a dreadful amount to spend and my daughter and I enjoyed creating this model together.</p>

<p abp=""616"">Definitely not the hardest Lego set about, as you can imagine, but it looks good and is a nice little project for a child to complete.</p>

With the Emerald Express this is the case as well, but maybe this is the first time you would consider buying three sets to be able to build&nbsp;them all.</p>

<p>The main model is a locomotive in a nice color scheme. Dark green combined with the red and black gives the train&nbsp;a nice authentic look. The other two models you can make a different model for a locomotive and a small carriage which would be used for transporting passengers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you would own three sets you can combine these three models to form one &quot;large&quot;&nbsp;train. They connect which each other and they look quite ok. Thanks to the color scheme you could use this Emerald Express also in a Christmas setting, it fits perfectly if you ask me!</p>

<p>The build is not that hard but the way the chimney is put in place at the main model&nbsp;is quite smart. If you would consider in buying this set I would recommend to buy three sets at once. It will add to the display value and it fits the Emerald Express better. And with the small price Lego asks for these kind of&nbsp;sets it will not hurt your budget too much.</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-07-18T16:08:21.497Z","Decent set","<p>This set is very fun to build&nbsp;but it does not have very good parts. You can build&nbsp;it into the engine, the passenger car, or the&nbsp;caboose. It is a set that you probably want three of so that you can have a whole train. It&#39;s a cool looking train but the other two builds don&#39;t make sense unless you have more than one of this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fairly priced set but unless you want to buy multiple of this thing, I would recommend other sets first.</p>
