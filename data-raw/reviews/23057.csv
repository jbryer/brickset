<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice box with 3 booklets, one for each model that can be built.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Combination of regular and technic part. Nice color. Great tyres. Beautiful headlights.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigures&nbsp;and no in scale with them.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Combination of regular bricks and technic bricks gives you great model with lot of fun building it. I did not have any Technic set before this one, and I was so amazed, that next day bought one (mini) Technic set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For now I built only main model, chopper, and it is great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you are fan of motorcycles, this is definitely&nbsp;a set worth of money.</p>

<p>It is not in minifigure&nbsp;scale, so it is not very playable, but it is really great and nice looking model.</p>

<p>For a set this small it is an exceptional building experience.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Comes in a small box depicting all three models on front and back. Three instruction booklets&nbsp;are inside, one for each model.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A varied assortment of parts. It is of&nbsp;course a small set, so the parts count is not impressive. There is a mix of system and technic parts.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very enjoyable and satisfying. There are some SNOT techniques used. The front part is mostly made of technic pieces. I think there is something to learn from this build for the less experienced builders.</p>

<p>As the box says, the set is intended for ages 7 and up, and that is due to the extensive use of&nbsp;technic pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What a surprise, the completed model actually looks better than in the box image. The shape of the chopper looks very natural.</p>

<p>The model stays upright by itself thanks to the wide tires. It is also nice to play with it over the table or ony other hard surface. It is very easy to steer and very stable while doing so. If pushed gently it can even roll by itself without support, but&nbsp;It will come to a stop soon after due to some&nbsp;friction in the wheel hubs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Worth every penny. I took it on a discount but I didn&#39;t expected such an enjoyable experience. It was a very pleasant surprise and that made me come here and write this review.</p>
