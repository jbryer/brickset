<p>The overall build process is simple and nothing spectacular for me. So this is a therapeutic build session... something about fixing two LEGO together just seems right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Took me around 30&nbsp;mins to finish... Of course, it looks awesome... the model is similar in size to the Red Rotor 31003. In fact the look for the front nose of the models are the same! Except since this is a plane, it has to be longer and wider.</p>

<p>They have started to use micro wheels for this sized models and this can be seen in both 31003 and 31012. Nothing really critical about this... just that models are not minifig&nbsp;scaled..&nbsp;</p>

<p>The B-Models, &nbsp;it sticks to the aviation theme nicely. In fact, i was tempted to get another one just for the helicopter. &nbsp;The Bi-Plane is design is not that exciting so i skipped the build.</p>

<p>The deciding factor for this purchase is to give the Red Rotor a company... and its really a nice match. Even for the B-Models of both sets.</p>

<p>If you want to get this one, grab 31003 if its still available. If you already have 31003.. This set is a MUST!</p>

<p>In the shop&nbsp;I wanted to choose a set with a relatively low price but with enough pieces&nbsp;to build something completely different and complex from.</p>

<p>I really liked the color&nbsp;palette&nbsp;and was really happy with the just-right amount of unique&nbsp;elements as well. &nbsp;(I wanted reusable common&nbsp;pieces for creative building.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately this set doesn&#39;t come with any mini figures, but it is not surprising since the figures would be too big to be placed inside.&nbsp;(Except for the biplane build, but in that case Homer&#39;s eyesight was blocked by the upper layer of wings, which is a bit annoying).</p>

<p>I enjoyed&nbsp;the building phase really much, but not for it&#39;s complexity, rather because of the built-up&nbsp;nostalgia&nbsp;demand I have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fairly easy build, but the end result looks really cool. It is fun to carry it around the room, spin the propeller from time-to-time, while making childish rotor-sounds. (The helicopter has the largest propeller, hence it keeps the spinning momentum for the longest time.)</p>

<p>To sum up, me and my girlfriend had fun building the 3 variations and I am very happy I added this set to my collection.</p>
