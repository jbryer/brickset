"legogal","2013-12-11T21:57:30.043Z","Me thinks me sees a thiddy cat! Yeow!","LEGO has hit another home run with its 31021 Furry Creatures Creator set. An amazing 280 or so pieces fit together in startling ways to produce an adorable thiddy cat and an even cuter mouse. This set suffers from a serious case of the cutesies!<div><br></div><div>From the printed round tile eyes to the cat's rounded torso and the mouse's cute little tail, the design is outstanding. Our cat has a few stability problems chasing the mouse around the kitchen table, and the mouse seems to run a bit faster and keep the chunk of cheese safe from thiddy cat.&nbsp;</div><div>Thiddy's head is so heavy it wants to droop, and mousie's tail won't stay up, duh? But they still are so darn cute. And that huge hunk of cheese has certain family members salivating!</div><div><br></div><div>Our only concern is that 20USD seems a bit high for such a small set. Maybe 15-16US would be more appropriate. But the Creator sets do come with multiple instruction books (two in this case,) and that does raise the price.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It is beyond entertaining…try amazing… to see how they use the weirdest parts to create fuzzy little critters. Let's hope that these critters keep multiplying because they make wonderful holiday gifts for those of us who prefer non-violent builds in these turbulent times.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4

<p>The building experience was fantastic, especially on the head parts, it was very challenging, the bodies were a bit quick and smaller than the head, but it gives a cartoonish feel and the parts stays well together, I only had difficulty with the bunny to make it stand. the dog is a bit similar to the cat but I liked mixing the colors, not all sides same color.</p>

<p>The pieces are wonderful, lots of curved parts, angular plates, bricks with knobs and with balls, nice color harmony, although mostly black &amp; white.</p>

<p>There is a lot of playability in this set, I could see children playing with it for hours.</p>

<p>I do recommend these kinds of sets</p>

It&nbsp;goes perfectly with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31019-1/Forest-Animals"">31019</a>, but somehow I liked the monkey more. Maybe it&#39;s because of color scheme (mostly black and white - but what else could I expect?!) or... because the monkey is bigger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most valuable about those sets is how many different&nbsp;animals you can make out of those parts! I didn&#39;t try to MOC it myself, but below you can see just one&nbsp;example of MOCs found on Rebrickable (apart from official B and C models which are&nbsp;rabbit and dog). Enjoy.&nbsp;</p>
