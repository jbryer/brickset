"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-08T02:00:29Z","Awesome set!","This set is fantastic!!! I bought it recently and: wow! This is based from the book and even a deleted scene from &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;. I love the dark gray and the dark dark blue blocks (never seen that shade of blue in Legos before!). Great colors! The bay window is soooo cool (plus tinted windows!). The chimney's construction is amazing and well thought-out. It has a door at the rear to let Harry slide out of the fireplace.

The Harry minifig is just average, but the Lucius Malfoy fig rocks!!! He is sooo awesome with that suit! To top this set off, it contains awesome accessories. It comes with a old-fashioned cash register, the Hand of Glory, a brain inside a jar, and a couple of brightly colored Lego &quot;Potterish&quot; items like a goblet, spider, and jewels.

Complaints are very few: this set doesn't need the flames (they are way too common in Lego sets) and I would've preferred more slant bricks for the roof instead of that gray 4x8 plate. This set is a must have for any HP Lego fan!!!  Did I mention that awesome bay window?!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legolander","2007-06-03T23:19:09.967Z","Another nice set for accessories...","The thing that I like about this set is that it has a lot of accessories and these are rare. It comes with 2 rubies; a purple and a red one, a brain (I think this is quite useful if only the had made a set for the Order of the Phoenix scene wherein there is an aquarium full of brains), and some potions. The only downside is that one of the corners of Knockturn Alley lacks windows or whatever parts you can place. Although it's a bit small, I think it deserves 4/5 stars!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It comes with a medium-sized gloomy looking shop and a chimney that Harry falls down. It also includes Harry in normal clothes and Lucius Malfoy with an awesome pinstriped suit in addition to a disembodied hand, a brain, some spiders, and other creepy things. Although playability isn't the greatest, the buildings are still cool and go well with other scary-looking buildings. The parts are definitely the best part of this set and the Minifig torsos also allow for greater possibilities when making non-HP minifigs</SPAN>.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>Cool buildings 
<li>Harry has civilian clothes 
<li>Pinstriped suit can make good gangsters 
<li>
<p>Lots of rare pieces</p>
<li>
<p>Reasonable price</p></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Doesn't really go with other HP sets 
<li>Not great playability</li></ul>

<p><SPAN style=""FONT-FAMILY: 'Verdana','sans-serif'; FONT-SIZE: 9.5pt"">I think this set is great for the parts and the buildings themselves. However, I think it would fit better in a crime-infested portion of LEGO City than next to Hogwarts Castle. That being said, it is still a great set and has more versatility than most other sets of the theme. I would definitely suggest this as yet another good LEGO Product.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></p>

"AETerry","2011-06-04T11:21:17.62Z","Knockturn Alley Review","<p>Having recently gotten this from e-bay at about $30 for a lucky deal, I'd say it was well worth getting to try and add older sets for Harry Potter that I'd missed or didn't get the first time around they were out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get two minifigures - Harry Potter and Lucius Malfoy. Harry looks pretty good, either his shirt/sweater is ruffled up or it's to look sooty from his having used the Flu Network system. Lucius looks very good too with his suit dress attire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first build in the set is for the Flu Network chimeny. It's a very solid build complete with having the roof section being able to lift up so you can set a minifigure in and then pull the ""tab"" out to make a mini appear from using the Flu Network. Though I've had some problems&nbsp;with the top part breaking before I figured out how to set the minifigure in and to just not try closing the roof section down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next build is for the shop that Lucius is stepping into or out of. Similiar to the Quality Quidditch Supplies set, this shop is sectional and folds out or in. I'd rather have the full store front folded out for display purposes. The detail work is very good for a set this size. There's flame torches on the entrance along with a pair of grey owl statues.&nbsp;The shop interior has a cash register, hand of glory tile piece and several other fun element pieces from brain in a jar, vials, gemstones and other pieces, even a neon yellow or green spider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, this is a rather fun set, recreating a scene from the books and movie. I feel it makes for a worthy addition to a Harry Potter collection. One that I'll be having up for display for a while.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
