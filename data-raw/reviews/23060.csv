"TeaWeevil","2014-01-01T16:22:21.737Z","A fantastic scene","<p>I've only built the main model so far, but I really like it. I may even like it better than my 5766 Log Cabin. It feels cozier (there are actual interior details--a small dresser with a lamp, a painting, an animal skull above the fireplace, a small table, and some firewood), and looks much more interesting--less like a simple rectangle. Although the build is fairly basic, there are a few cool techniques (for example, there are some clip pieces subtly built in to keep the building in place, either open or closed). The roof looks great; I love the combination of dark red and bright red, and the brown with green on top is nice (green 1x1 round plates!) I'm less fond of the rock/mountain bit; the scale is just so weird. It might be a good starting point for a larger rock formation, but as it is, it just looks a bit off. I will say, however, that it does a very good job of incorporating the BURPs into a natural-looking mountain--especially in comparison to something like 6584 Extreme Team Challenge. I think that a slight bit of modification could get it to look right at the current scale as a small rock formation (or, alternately, a huge amount of modification could get it to look right at a much more massive scale as an actual mountain). The quad is ok (nice to get those hubcaps, though), as is the minifigure. I would have preferred a more mountain-specific torso, but the face is a newer and less common one, so that's nice.</p><p>&nbsp;The alternate models do a pretty decent job of disguising the BURPs, as well. The small lodge has a nice interior, but doesn't look as appealing as the main model. The mountaintop lookout manages to have interior details, as well. It also has a strange-looking tree with an ingenious woodpecker that attaches to the tree by its hinge plate feet. Fantastic! While I'll certainly build the alt models, I like the main hut well enough that I'll settle on that one. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"MesaVerde","2014-03-15T17:12:29.327Z","Solid Creator Addition for 2014","<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I like the water pieces and the light blue door and windows. The hanging red mineral is also great and reminds me of Classic Space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Not much to talk about here. The draw of the set is the build and not the minifig. I do like brick built birds so I am happy to add an eagle to the collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty straightforward build. I enjoyed the scenic mountain piece of the set. The set definitely has the feel of a rugged woodsy mountain/forest feel. I thought the smoke from the chimney was a good idea on the cabin. The interior of the cabin was nice with the dresser and fireplace.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really think the finished model does a good job of capturing a mountain hut in the wilderness. I&nbsp;size of the&nbsp;hut and overall&nbsp;look of the building&nbsp;in good. I do wish they would have used grey and brown hinges on the hut instead of black. The mountain is open enough to create hiking or other scenes and I like this part of the set more than I thought.&nbsp;I also like the waterfall idea but wish that the stream/river would not be above the ground.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great addition to the Creator house line. The price is good especially compared to City. Better for AFOLs than children as my son wasn&#39;t too interested compared to the City sets.</p>

"27Explosions","2014-03-28T13:35:31.667Z","Value in abundance","<p>I recently moved half way across the world from the UK to South Korea and this is the first set I purchased over here to restart up a small collection. As a display piece, I couldn&#39;t be more pleased.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box is what you&#39;d expect from the creator series, pictures of all the possible builds complete with 3 fairly hefty instruction books inside, it gives the package a solid feel, even if it could be classed as deceptively weighty.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>This set has an incredible price per piece ratio. Having moved from the UK the price I ended up paying for this set worked out at about 5p per piece, it&#39;s not even that they&#39;re all small pieces - you get a lot of substantial bricks for the house build and two large pre-set rock pieces for the mountain. It also comes with some more interesting pieces as well such as the red crystal, the brick designed pieces for the chimney and the printed painting piece for inside (no stickers to be seen thankfully so another huge positive there.)</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The build that takes you to the completed model is fairly standard but it does produce a lovely display piece. The set is well balanced with the building on one side and substantial environment on the other to create an interesting scene. These photos show some of the angles of the set that are maybe not as readily available online -&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.gyazo.com/f17741152340a8b7216e5c02f4dc032c.png"" style=""height: 250px; width: 335px;"" /></p>

<p>Above we see the detailing on the chimney which in my opinion is one of the best parts of the set, the smoke is very well worked. You can also see the tree attached to the set rather than a random separate&nbsp;part which I&#39;m not a fan of.</p>

<p>Here we see a close up looking into the cave on the mountainside. As I&#39;ve seen mentioned the water seemingly above ground is a little bit off putting but on a model this size it can be forgiven. In the background you can see a great use of a gun piece for the lantern on the front of the house.</p>

<p>Finally, we have my favourite part of the set - the interior. Personally I feel the inside of this set has an almost Modular series level of detail. Compared to some other creator sets such as the seaside house which are barren inside this set is just fantastic. The painting piece looks great, a firewood holder and the fireplace topped with a brilliantly made little bulls head make this an enchanting little set. I find myself displaying the set open to show all this off a lot of the time.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>Overall, this is a great set. Playability is really only going to come from the little quad bike that comes with it, there&#39;s no play features and not really much space for adventures. As such, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this set to children, but for adults looking for a display set this set will be hard to beat. A brilliant price per piece ratio, lovely details and overall a feeling that it just exudes all that is Lego.</p>

"armaangoel78","2014-06-29T20:26:56.777Z","Lego Mountain Hut: Great for displaying your lego skills","<p style=""font-size: medium;"">This detailed $40 creator set has 3 different builds and 550 pieces. &nbsp;The price per piece is less than 7 cents, which is very good.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Parts</span></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">There are not that many types of parts in this set, but the hinge pieces the pieces in the&nbsp;ATV&nbsp;stand out from the other pieces in this set. &nbsp;In terms of quantity your getting&nbsp;alot&nbsp;for $40: 550 pieces so a 7 cent per piece ratio, very, very good.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">It is obvious the main focus of this set, is the builds. The minifig has dark blue pants, red torso, yellow hands&nbsp;and a bearded face he also comes with a pickaxe. &nbsp;I think some rope would be cool to include, since he&#39;s a mountain climber, but it still looks good without</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The mountain&nbsp;and ATV were fun to build as well as the pine tree, but the hut was not that exiting. &nbsp;Theres nothing boring in the this set but that doesn&#39;t mean some parts weren&#39;t that fun to build. It took me about 2-3 hours to build this set, but I really didn&#39;t time myself.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The completed model</span></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Like most creator sets, this has 3 different models, each with a different difficulty level. &nbsp;The main model has a nice mountain with foliage and a waterfall that leads to a river. &nbsp;there is a bridge over the river, and a fire with a pot on top, next to the bridge. There is a pine tree on the side. &nbsp;In front of the hut there is a small porch with a place to hold the pickaxe and a lantern. On the front of the hut there is a light blue door and window, that both open. &nbsp;On the left side there is a chimney with a mix of normal and mason brick, giving a worn effect. Inside there is a fireplace with a animal skull on top, a table, stacks of wood logs, a painting of a ship, and a dresser with a lantern on top. &nbsp;The ATV is blue, white, and orange, and I really like the nice exhaust effect on the bottom. &nbsp;There is a nice bald eagle micro build on top of the mountain.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">I overall like this set, and think that it is great for teens and adults everywhere, especially people with a love of the outdoors, like me. &nbsp;The included pieces make it an easy set to make your own outdoorsy mocks out of. &nbsp;I recommend this set alot, and is a great display piece for a lego fan.</p>
