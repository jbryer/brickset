"MrD","2014-02-05T10:08:26.803Z","A Strange Beast from Below","<p>To preface this review let me say I have very little knowledge about Hero Factory or any other constraction sets but I wanted the purple teeth which are new&nbsp;to this set to make a &quot;Friends&quot; coloured monster.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Packed in a plastic bag like other Hero Factory sets with the slogan &quot;Invasion from Below&quot; . The instructions were pretty mangled inside the packaging. Inside the instruction booklet is a four page comic which allowed me to deduce that the Jawbeast was the baddy and that Stormer, the goody with his single spear to defend himself. At the end of the comic Jawbeast is transformed into a fierce three headed beast. The last 6 pages off the instructions are ads for Hero factory and show you how you can combine sets to make these bigger creations.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Even though there are only 49 pieces in this set there are a few worth mentioning. I purchased it for the purple teeth pieces, 6 were listed in the inventory but an extra is included. Stormer the minifigure is also interesting. He consists of a plain blue minifigure head with a white gridiron type helmet. His body is a black skeleton covered by an armour piece new to this line with a stud on the front and a rod on the back. The arms and legs are also new to this line. The legs are especially interesting as they have a clip at the top but also a section at the back of the leg for a clip to attach to and I can see them being used to make some interesting&nbsp;sci-fi type mocs.</p>

<p>The feet pieces of Jawbeast are also new to this line and the 4 ball and socket pieces in trans blue are unique to this set. I also like the three fin type pieces that are used for the hands and tail and will be getting 8 more of them when I get the Chima set 70130 Sparatus&#39; Spider Stalker where they are used as the spider vehicles&nbsp; legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Clip, clip, clip and it&#39;ll be done in under 5 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very poseable, as to be expected for these types of sets. The Jawbeast is pretty fierce looking although I would have liked the print of the eyes on the purple head piece to have been a little more pronounced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As I said earlier&nbsp;I purchased this set for the purple teeth but I was surprised by the other new pieces especially the new Stormer minifigure. I can see myself probably buying more Hero Factory as I now have a desire to moc my own beasts using the predominantly ball and socket connections used in these type of sets.</p>

The set&#39;s overall look and feel is really good. Getting a Stormer minifigure is awesome! The color scheme of Teel Blue, Purple, and Black is amazing.

"Golem25","2014-06-27T10:14:58.49Z","Great Introduction To Invasion From Below","<p>I was heartbroken when Bionicle&nbsp;ended and was replaced with HF. As a fan of constraction since the Slizers/Throwbots, I felt the early HF sets lacked the charm and relative depth of Bionicle sets, and vowed to leave the theme to the wayside.</p>

<p>Fast forward four years, and the theme has had a bit of a revamp with Kaiju and mechs being introduced alongside a new type of minifig. With me being a fan of all three, I succumbed and bought into the theme.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Resealable bags.... they have their pros and cons. They are decidely friendlier to the environment, and more easily stored when empty, but the canisters of old allowed for much easier storage of the set and gave you slightly bent instructions as opposed to the crumpled leaflet I got with this set.</p>

<p>The instructions were very clear, with no conflicting colours, and a cutsey depiction of a jumper in the corner of every page. With 4 pages of comics, plus images of the combo models and ads for the other sets in the line (and the ubiquitious&nbsp;WIN/GAGNE/GEWINNE&nbsp;on the back), you&#39;ve got something to oggle after building.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Jaw Beast itself clocks in at 37 pieces, with a slew of new, recoloured, and useful parts. The two jaw pieces immediately draw your attention, but, while one has lovely printing, their use is limited outside of the Invasion From Below context. Underneath them is the printed four long armor piece exclusive to this set. Teal and orange make for a daring combination, even if the latter is limited to this piece and the upper jaw.</p>

<p>The set includes 7 curved barb pieces (6 used in the build plus one spare) in ever-so-rare purple. and are sure to please. They complement the black armor and teal sockets incredibly well, surprisingly, and make for a standout colour scheme.</p>

<p>To round out the Beast&#39;s extremities are new foot pieces (which provide more stability than you would suspect given their small size), and three new pincer-like pieces on the arms and tail. These are common throughout this year&#39;s HF sets, so the real draw for parts collectors here are the transparent blue bones (the smallest size). This set includes four, and with the only other set that features the piece (a solitary one in 70147 Sir Fangar&#39;s Ice Fortress) being much more expensive, Jaw Beast will prove to be very popular with that particular demographic.</p>

<p>The other twelve pieces listed in the instructions are used to build and equip the Stomer fig. While the limbs are nicely detailed, they are limited in their use outside of HF; this is made up for by the other elements, such as the beautifully sculpted helmet, the simply delightful blue minifigure head, an universal armor piece, and a&nbsp;1x2 tile in transparent&nbsp;blue and hero core, both printed.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The introduction of new minfig-esque characters is always exciting (the drones in Exo-Force had me jumping with joy) and these new Hero-figs do not disappoint. Their detailing allows them to stay true to their previous constraction iterations, while their scale (slightly taller than minifigures) permits the use of accessories from System sets, evidenced by the inclusion of a spear piece and clip+tile in this set. The figure is marred by limited articulation and not being very poseable as a result. The armor allowing the helmet to rotate only so far can be overlooked, but the lack of adjustable hands is simply disappointing (if somewhat understandable). All in all, however, I find these new figs satisfactory, and I sincerely hope that Lego will have Hero Factory continue down this road.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>With only 37 pieces going into the beast and the figure using a few more pieces than your average fig, the build clocks in at around 5 minutes, with veteran builders being able to dip well under it. The process is a bit backwards, with the hero chest piece being used to bulk up the back of the torso rather than the front. Other than that, you simply snap together the bone pieces, plug in the barbs, and you&#39;re done. A little modification I would suggest is to attach the printed armor piece upside down; this allows for more coverage of the lower abdomen, while affording the head a bit more room for articulation.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Jaw Beast certainly is a looker; as said before, his colour scheme is daring and I feel it provides a breath of fresh air. I don&#39;t remember teal and purple having been seen in the same box since an early Bionicle&nbsp;wildlife set and those old Technic sets with large sized figures (a quick wade through the archives reveals these to be &#39;99&#39;s Competition sets), let alone having both colours on the same model!</p>

<p>The beast has 14 points of articulation, and that is no mean feat for a set this size. You can get it to assume a wide range of increasingly cool, menacing, or ludicrous poses; the tail is extremely useful in this regard by adding balance, or, if need be, extra stability when posed to touch the ground.</p>

<p>The head can be a bit of a pain in this regard, due to it hanging far from the body&#39;s center&nbsp;of balance when aiming for a forward-looking pose, but this doesn&#39;t mar the model as Jaw Beast&#39;s &quot;arms&quot; provide some ambiguity; you can easily picture them as a second set of legs, essentially making him a quadruped and opening up another range of poses.</p>

<p>While playability would be very limited with just a ratcheting jaw on this model, the inclusion of Stormer will provide children with all they need for extensive playtime; a good guy and a big monster! The spear can be set up in the jaws to prop them open, giving the Hero fig a fighting chance, and I&#39;m sure the target audience can find many more ways to incapacitate the beast. With all of these possibilities in mind, I can see not only this set but the entire wave being a huge hit. No immediate need to buy two sets when each one has both sides of the conflict included. But with the Heroes being highly collectable, and the general brilliance of the Kaiju, it&#39;s hard to resist getting more than one Hero Factory set this year.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>To summarize, I am incredibly pleased with this set by itself; it offers a decent trove of new and interesting parts, a new form of minifigure, features ample opportunities for all kinds of great poses, looks great on display, and is very playable indeed.</p>

<p>While I will remain miffed for as long as the US gets sets for X Dollars while Europeans have to pay X Euros, I feel that the price of this set doesn&#39;t detract from the overall package too much. I was initially waiting for a 20% off promotion to get this set, but in the end I couldn&#39;t keep myself from buying it at full retail value, and, in a way, Jaw Beast is worth the price of admission.</p>

<p>If anything, he is a great introduction to the line, and I am even more excited about the prospect of getting the large beasts from this wave (44020 and 44021). Let&#39;s see if I can keep my wallet clenched shut until that promotional price cut.....</p>
