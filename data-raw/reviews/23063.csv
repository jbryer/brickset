<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>This set comes not in a box but in plastic bag which is resealable. It shows Stormer in his mech under attack of two spider creatures. Some say that these new bags are stupid idea, but in my opinion its better than old bionicle boxes.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Set contains some nice parts for example little trans orange dish, trans blue container parts, visor, and minifig Stormer parts. In my opinion these are parts exactly the parts that you would expect from hero factory set mixed with some unique and uncommon parts.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Only one minifig is Stormer which is built from black skeleton torso (quite strange), new mold hands and legs, new armor piece, blue head, new Stormer helmet and flat round stud brick with H printed on it (you get two of them) also comes with minifig blaster and printed datapad connected to its hand.&nbsp;</div>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing special here, just be careful not to confuse stickers.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>Very nice model came out, great playability - spinning freeze weapon, opening container, flick-fire missiles (as one would expect) and little jumpers that can be flicked into air. I was actually pleased with this set.</div>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As one of little that like hero factory i must say that this set is worth it. You get nice amount of parts, one minifig and in this combination it makes this set worth of money.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,4
