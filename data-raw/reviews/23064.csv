"Paragon132","2014-08-08T01:57:20.897Z","Probably the best of the first wave","<p>Since I usually buy legos on a whim, I saw this at wal-mart on clearance (which is kind of odd, but i didn&#39;t question it) and I&#39;m overall very pleased with it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Normal weird plastic bag, which is kind of started to grow on me, and regular instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Normal HF ball and socket limbs, and a decent amount of red peices.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two, if you count the jumper. Furno is slightly rare, I believe you can get him in the splitter beast set, and will be available again in the second wave.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A rather interesting build. The designers made good use of the joints on the back to make the jetpack-light-arms thing, and I really like how they did that. So, a great build overall.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>An average sized mech, that looks really great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would say, in my opinion, if you&#39;re going to get one set from the line, this is the set. This is probably the best set with a lot of playability and a great build and use of pieces.</p>
