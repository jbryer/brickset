"Berrus_Brickus","2014-08-22T03:12:42.407Z","Is the Stealth Machine better left hidden?","<p>I haven&#39;t ever really been immersed in LEGO constraction. I did end up with a few of those strange Knights&#39; Kingdom figures, and I loved BIONICLE, though my interest in it sort of flickered until the last few years, and by then it was too late.</p>

<p>Hero Factory never particularly inspired me until the Breakout wave, but even then I didn&#39;t get any of the sets for myself until this one. So, my perspective may not be <em>the </em>most useful to dedicated fans of Hero Factory, but I would encourage fans like me who have largely ignored this corner of the LEGO world for the last few years or more.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Though I liked the symbolism of the BIONICLE cannisters as pills for Mata Nui, thought was more retrospectively after it was explained, and most of the cans drifted from that design in later years, so I can&#39;t say I cared for them too much. There was really no reason HF had to carry that tradition for me, and though the glossy bags they use make them stand out on a store shelf, I&#39;m also not so sure it is in a good way. For me at least, I often find them crinkled and knocked over. They don&#39;t fit in, and it might take someone adventurous to try them.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just my thoughts at least, once you actually purchase the set, the bag is something that can be appreciated because it uses less material than the cannisters and is easier to either save or dispose of.</p>

<p>There is some neat art on the top and bottom of the bag. Though the art style isn&#39;t quite my cup of tea, I do like it when packaging includes something like this which may inspire other art types than MOCing.</p>

<p>There is one instruction book included with a comic in the beginning. They are easy enough to follow and moved at a good pace to warm me back up to constraction building.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Having only one constraction set, that being this one of course, I&#39;m not in the position to do too much MOCing or know what bones in what colors and shells in which size are rarer. One of the things that did catch my eye though is that a lot of the pieces are in colors like black, dark gray, and titanium metallic which are either neutral or something I do (or would) use plenty of if I did MOC.</p>

<p>There are a few parts that System builders might find of interest, like the transparent bright green lightsaber blades, the claws, the windshield, and the containment cell. I can&#39;t say I would recommend buying it for those alone. They are great, but it would probably be better to have a use in mind for the bones and shells so that they don&#39;t go to waste. Some recent Chima and Ninjago sets have integrated them, so those may be places to look for inspiration.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The mini-heroes are what piqued my interest enough to give this set a try, and well, I tried it. Rocka&#39;s design is a little odd. His helmet is designed well and the eyes and mouth line up with most minifigures, and I&#39;m also happy that his head is consistent with past incarnations (no continuity with eye color is something that bothers me). His armor is amazing, and I think that it looks great on regular minifigures (though it might be too large for some folks). His arms are a little bony, but they are okay. It&#39;s the legs that bother me. I can tell that the designer had trouble designing them, and I wish that they didn&#39;t have the bend in the knee, or that they they had a wider stance (though that would mean a new torso; the mini-heroes use a skeleton&#39;s ribcage) because I think that they look awkward when he is standing, though they are okay for when he is behind the cockpit.</p>

<p>Rocka stands noticeably taller than a minifigure.</p>

<p>The jumper is a forgetable part of the set for me, but it does its job well and I did enjoy making it hop in the air and hoping that it would land on its feet, which happens about 50% of the time. The orange and black combination was a good choice for this set, because it contrasts nicely with the stealth machine.</p>

<p>If you are interested in the jumpers though, there are other sets at this price point (and lower ones) which include more than one.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build really wasn&#39;t too different from a standard BIONICLE set from its last few years, and if you lack a vantage point for that, that is to say that it is pretty simple and predictable if you realize the different connections that the CCBS encompasses (and if you didn&#39;t, it would be pretty easy to notice). That isn&#39;t a bad thing for me, since it has been a few years, but there was nothing surprising. I didn&#39;t have to do too much pin-pushing, so that was nice at least.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I am quite pleased with the final model and I really like the colorscheme. That was probably the deciding factor for me. The &quot;loincloth&quot; and hockey player shoulder pads help to set it apart a bit from some of the other mechs (and past heroes). However, Furno Jet Machine is probably visually superior in areas besides the colors.</p>

<p>The design does have a few issues though. First off, the pieces that hold those green lasers on the side of the cockpit in place are wobbly. Then, the printed shell is a lighter silver than the hue which is used on the rest of the machine. The way that LEGO positions it on the box to hide it bothers me because it means that they noticed how glaring it is. Otherwise, images also show Rocka with his feet tucked in behind the overhanging shell loincloth thingy, which I vaguely remember accomplishing when I first built the set, but I&#39;m not sure I recall correctly because now it seems impossible. Even if it weren&#39;t shown that way on the bag, exposed legs are still a problem.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><span class=""rangySelectionBoundary"" id=""selectionBoundary_1408673223711_8143437098812956"" style=""line-height: 0; display: none;"">?</span><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A refreshing and attention grabbing appliance of Constraction systems</li>
	<li>The color scheme</li>
	<li>Solid design</li>
	<li>Fairly useful parts array for someone new to the CCBS</li>
	<li>Hero minifigures are fun to have pilot the mechs, if nothing else</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>That light silver shell is distracting</li>
	<li>Hero minifigures are positioned oddly</li>
	<li>Slightly misleading packaging</li>
	<li>Only one sphere is included for the gun arm; it&#39;s easy to lose</li>
	<li>Dedicated fans might not be charmed by the standard Hero build, even with the mech gimmick</li>
</ul>

<p>Rocka Stealth Machine hasn&#39;t quite blown me away as an introduction to the CCBS nor a reintroduction to constraction, but it has provided me with some good parts for BIONICLE&#39;s return (which has been confirmed about five times now) and an appreciation for the CCBS. I never cared for Exo-Fore nor its magna influence, but looking back, I regret not giving it a chance, and I hope that anyone who is considering trying one of these CCBS mechs HF is providing for the year bites the bullet and gives it a try. Though there might be better options than Rocka Stealth Machine, it is a safe bet. What you see in images, is pretty much exactly what this is. There are no surprises, which might not mean that it is a great set, but it is a solid one.</p>
