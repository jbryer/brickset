<p>Very good,and has some great pieces.</p>

<h3>Bag/Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bag:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s just like any Hero Factory set nowadays, it is packaged in a resealable</p>

<p>Bag, which is always handy to keep LEGO pieces in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Instructions:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are just like any other set really.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are very good if your into building Hero Factory Mocs.</p>

<p>Some of the Great parts you get in this set includes</p>

<p>New Feet, New Claws, Light Blue Bone Pieces(you get six), Flyer Beast&#39;s head pieces and a Printed amour plate.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The minifigure you get is Breez, she only come in this set so a lot of People will probably get this for the minifigure.</p>

<p>Breez is a very nice Minifigure, she has sliver amour and she has a transparent Orange Chain and she has her Rocket boots.</p>

<p>Overall Breez&nbsp;is a very good Minifigure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The Build is quite easy and can be done within ten minutes, but is still a very fun set to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model is very nice and is very colourful, with Blue and Yellow</p>

<p>Pieces which will be great for Mocs, though his claw is a bit short,but it can be easily fixed.</p>

<p>There is also a piece on Flyer Beasts back which allows you to attach Breez onto Flyer Beasts back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set, definitely worth picking up.</p>
