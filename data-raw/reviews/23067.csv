<p>Bag with cool artwork at the bottom</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good mixture of teal, orange, red and yellow and parts count goes above 100, but narrowly</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures of Evo and Furno, but I don&#39;t like how Evo&#39;s comm device/pad on his left arm is designed because the gray piece that attaches onto it can&#39;t handle a 2 piece sized brickin length</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fun, mostly simple and very durable</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Well built, splitting function takes awhile due to it taking awhile to detach the splitter beasts, mini figures are most stable and durable</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set in nearly every way, but the splitting function&#39;s mostly difficult to do consistently</p>
