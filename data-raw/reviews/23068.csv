"Psithur","2015-03-01T02:35:24.687Z","""Take 'Em Out, Evo!""","<p>Hi all! I am toasentann13, a.k.a ts, and this is my first review on Brickset! : D I got this set this weekend for the heck of it and I was actually very surprised with its results. Anyways, let us get on to the review!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging of the set comes in a large bag. The cover art is of Evo&#39;s Mech running in kind of a &quot;stealth mode&quot;. The very top of the front of the bag shows a &quot;cartoon&quot; of Evo rushing to his mech&nbsp;to avoid those pesky jumpers.&nbsp;The back of the bag just shows the set&#39;s functionality. TLG did something very special with even the bottom of the bag. I was a little bit disappointed, however, that it was the same art as on the front of the bag. The bag is also quite heavy and appears that it is loaded to the top.</p>

<p>The instructions arrive unsecured and folded in half, which really isn&#39;t that big of a deal for me. The instructions are <strong>37</strong> pages and <strong>27</strong> steps of building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is a fairly decent set for parts. You get two of those feet from Stormer XL, seven #4 armor in gunmetal grey, seven #5 armor in yellow, one small turntable that is also in the VOLVO L350F, three XS torsos, and four armor add on pieces ( I don&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;re called), first introduced in Breakout, in gunmetal grey. You also get a &quot;H&quot; liftarm, which was new for 2014. I was relatively disappointed with the bones, as there are no new or interesting parts in this category.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Evo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Evo has the same design as all of the other heroes of 2014, but he does contain a red head piece and a nice helmet. He also has a datapad, unlike some of the other heroes. I think he is a fairly good minifigure overall.</p>

<p><strong>Jumper (x2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>In the set, you get two jumpers, one in red and one in orange. They are just like any other jumper, and like the rest, aren&#39;t very good at &quot;jumping&quot; (LOL)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was rather interesting and split up into four sections.</p>

<p><strong>#1: The Waist</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The waist was rather long of a build, although it was the most interesting. This part of the build was mainly Technic with a few gears here and there.</p>

<p><strong>#2: The Legs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The legs were the strangest part of the build, with Technic and some ball-and-socket pieces in the upper leg areas.</p>

<p><strong>#3: The Torso&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The torso is mainly Ball-and-Socket, with some shells to cover it up.</p>

<p><strong>#4: The Arms&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>The arms were the easiest part of the build, where 99% of it is Ball-and-Socket. I really like the design of the right arm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I love it! Honestly, it&#39;s a lot bigger than I thought and a lot bulkier, too. It&#39;s very filled in. There are a couple of things I can complain about, though. First of all, I wish that there was a ratcheting abdomen instead of a &quot;swivel design&quot;. Second, I don&#39;t like how you can&#39;t move the wrists or ankles. Third, I don&#39;t like the laser-things by the cockpit. And finally, I don&#39;t like how far back the jumper&#39;s container is. However I made&nbsp;a slight modification for this. First, take off the container with the blue pegs and yellow liftarm. Next, you take off the yellow liftarm and slide the container with the blue pegs in all the way. There should be the ends of the pegs sticking out. Here, put the yellow litarm back on, so now it should look like &quot;container, black litarm, yellow liftarm&quot;. And for once, I actually like the flick-fires and the zamor sphere launcher. I also think the way the spare flick-fires are stored are quite clever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like it a lot! It&#39;s by far my favorite Invasion From Below set. There may be a few design flaws, but I think TLG did this on purpose so kids can use their imagination and creativity to fix these. In fact, this might just be my favorite HF set TO DATE!!!</p>

<p>The set is 193 pieces, for $25 USD, which is a fantastic deal.</p>

<p>BUY IT WHILE YOU CAN!!!</p>

<p>Anyways, so long for now!!!</p>
