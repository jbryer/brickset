I never saw <em>that </em>in the cartoons when I was a kid but hey, I haven&#39;t watched a Spiderman cartoon in about 20 years so maybe it has changed (like so many others) in the meantime?&nbsp;O tempora o mores -&nbsp;I&#39;ll just shut up now and do this review through the eyes of a five-year-old...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Someone else bought this for my son as a Christmas gift&nbsp;and I did not even&nbsp;have&nbsp;the chance to take a look at the box (it was torn to pieces in an instant). The instructions are simple enough as he could build the set all by himself, in fact he&nbsp;has done so several times now. Again I should mention that these small booklets are really too fragile to be used by children, after a few uses there are tears and creases on every page, so much so that I&#39;m actually tempted to print out a copy on sturdier paper and let them play with that since I think I lost a lot of instructions this way too when I was a kid.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One big, ugly, red vehicle base but the children like it (for now at least) as it makes it easier to build a vehicle that can take some rough handling. Some printed parts too, though the possibility to use them with something that has nothing to do with Spider-man is nearly nonexistent (and even then, only if you&#39;re really going for an over-the-top cartoony look).&nbsp;Still, no stickers is definitely a plus since it is supposed to be for very young children anyway. Some more red and blue parts (unsurprisingly), a couple of grey parts, some flames&nbsp;and last but not least some&nbsp;cobwebs round out the part selection.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Of course, the main draw of the set. Having two young boys who are in &#39;Spider-man equals just about the coolest thing on earth&#39; phase definitely helps to make this set a star in their lego collection, and since it comes with both Spider-man and Venom there&#39;s a spider-man for each, great! I&#39;ve not checked if these junior Spider-man and Venom are different from those in other sets but they&#39;re recognizable and do the job, Spider-man could have benefited from some printing on his legs (how quickly I&#39;ve grown used to that)&nbsp;but overall they are fine, especially since my childhood lego never went beyond front torso printing in one or two colours anyway. ;)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There&#39;s not much to it, but my son likes&nbsp;to build this car&nbsp;so much he&#39;s done it several times now, the only real competition in this regard is from #70126 Crocodile Legend Beast which is the other set he has that has been rebuilt several times.&nbsp;Only recently has he started creating his own designs with it (which mostly means some variant of a spider-car or spider-jet, there&#39;s not much else to be done with these parts) so this can be called a success. No help needed at all so thumbs up from a kid&#39;s perspective!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Really, the car is just filler and that&#39;s not even going into the 2 x 4 bricks forming the wall Venom is standing next to. All the kids&nbsp;really want is Spider-man and Venom (and cobwebs, you can never have enough cobwebs). That said, building the car has been fun and it&#39;s nice for them that you can drive it as well as fly it, although the plate with those&nbsp;wings will come off from time to time.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all, a lot better then I would give it credit for. Now, if only they could change that price, &euro;13 for 50 pieces and 2 minifigs? OK, those minifigs <em>are</em> Spider-man and Venom but still, over 20 cents per piece is not what I call good value.&nbsp;Though in the end,&nbsp;they&#39;re not complaining and since I didn&#39;t have to&nbsp;pay for it neither am I!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDIT: so, half a year later and Venom is still looking good but Spider-man&#39;s head print is already fading and his leg joints are really loose. That didn&#39;t last long (or is he really being played with <em>that</em> much)?</p>
