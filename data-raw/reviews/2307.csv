Some of the colors are girlish but then, you can always ignore them and appreciate the brilliance of this set. I give it 4 stars!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

On one hand they are hard to get but lot like the raided the Belleville parts bin. I do like this set because of all the extra uninque parts, the mirror, the chalk borard, potion bottles etc. If the colors had matched most of the other series sets it would be a big 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

As an 11 year old, I was ecstatic, as in the UK Harry Potter fever has shaken the country leading up to christmas, and Harry Potter Lego was devoid in nearly all shops. My Auntie, who had a network of friends on the lookout for ANYTHING HP lego, managed to snag this, whose friend had pretty much have to fight with a woman (who already had&nbsp;2 of these in her hand)&nbsp;in a Tescos store to get it. I was overjoyed when I unwrapped it, to discover I owned HP lego! True, the colours were odd, and it only came with Harry, but still I owned HP lego!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This will never compete with the other sets available at the time, like forbidden corridor, but it is a fun set. It features an array of neat little items, like opening books with secret ingredients hidden inside, colourful potion bottles, hedwig the owl, a frog, an irradiated spider, and gold keys. It is deffinately going to look odd if you put it with the rest of the HP sets, but if you want a bright campy hogwarts, this is a set for you! And as an 11 year old, I was overjoyed to recieve it. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It does seem overpriced these days on ebay, so I would suggest looking elsewhere for it, but if you do get it, try not to be too critical of it. It may be small and limited, but it was cheap back in the day, and made me one happy&nbsp; 11 year old!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,3,4

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hogwarts Classrooms defies genuine description... I'm not sure if this was supposed to be some sort of Impulse Set, a Mini-Figure with alternative models or an addition to Hogwarts Castle, all I do know is that it is one of the stranger sets available from the line.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two primary models with this set, what may be part of Snape's Potions Class and the room where Harry discovered the Mirror of Erised before it was placed in the bowels below the Forbidden Corridor. These models are simple to build, they also are a tad on the smallish side, it was difficult to fit more than the one Mini-Figure on either set without it looking out of proportion. Included with this set also was a large foldable cardboard piece that was intended to represent a wall of each room. A rather unusual choice on LEGO's part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more I think about it though the more I'm sure these sets were really a means to get some interesting and unique colored pieces. Everything was in odd shades of orange and pink or white, accessory wise you were given a wand for Harry, Hedwig the owl, a transparent green spider, a large black cauldron, a small green frog, two gold keys, two different books, some nice printed plates with magical ingredients on them, the chalkboard (I can't recall if it was a sticker or printed detail.) and of course the mirror. Apparently there was a spare wand as well in a transparent color, some potions containers and Harry's invisibility cloak. (represented by a blue cape.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'm just not sure what to say about this set. On the one hand it's a great source for some really good oddly colored fantasy like pieces, on the other, as I recall, it was a little on the expensive side for what you got. Because the boxes had to be large enough to accomodate the folding pieces of cardboard. I guess I'd have to say if you're looking for some unique pieces then you definitely should get this set, but if you want something to represent classrooms in Hogwarts castle you'd be better off MOCing something else.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
