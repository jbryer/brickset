"camaroman","2014-04-22T05:14:43.687Z","Bought on a whim","<p>I had recently bought this set for my 4 year old grandson. Today, at lunch I was able to pick up another with no out of pocket expense. I decided to go ahead and open the box to see what Luke would receive for his birthday in a few weeks.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a sturdy reusable tub that will come in handy for parts storage. I think that smaller hands will find it easy to open and close at playtime!</p>

<p>I must confess, I have not even looked at the&nbsp; two instruction booklets yet!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The parts come in the tub separated into three of the standard Lego numbered bags. The exception to this is the eight sided baseplate and one other large part (that I don&#39;t recall right now).</p>

<p>Of special interest was that aforementioned tan octagon baseplate and the bond patterned bricks in two different colors. Also included was a kid friendly car base and wheelbarrow(in red). The set also has several pieces in Dark Azure that are of interest for building structures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has one lone construction minifig.</p>

<p>He will have his work cutout for him doing all the work this set should be able to provide. If there is a complaint, it is the lack of another figure to help this guy! Of course that would have increased the price to about 19.00 rather than less than 15.00!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>So far, no comment, as I have not built anything.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Ditto!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was impressed enough with the value of this non-purchase that I went back to the store&nbsp; after work and bought another for the parts content alone! Highly recommend at least one!</p>

<p>Set comes in a large brick shaped bucket. The set takes up about one third of the bucket, making this an excellent storage bin for other sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two instruction booklets. One for the complete set as shown on the bin, and one &quot;rebuild&quot; manual for some other build variants.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One construction worker with hat. He also has a shovel, pick axe, and a wheel barrow.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I built this with my Lego-savvy 3-year-old and aside from a few small bricks, he was able to build the models.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Lots of fun! The crane rotates smoothly on its base, there&#39;s a truck and tons of spare bricks.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><strong>Everyone should own this set. It&#39;s that simple.</strong></p>

<p>You get a storage bin, 160 pieces, a wheeled base, minifig accessories, and fun models. And here is the best part: <strong>it comes with a brick removal tool which makes short work of all the cases where you might otherwise break your fingernails trying to pry pieces apart.</strong></p>

<p>This set is easily worth $45 - at $15 it is a steal.</p>
