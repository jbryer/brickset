"MrD","2014-01-24T04:34:30.207Z","Perfect for your young (or old) princess","<p>Upfront I will say I'm a 40 year old male who likes ""Friends"". Admittedly I have two young daughters to hide my penchant for pink behind.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Comes in a nice plastic 4x2 style brick container which from the look of the bottom of it can be stacked on others of the ""Juniors"" range.</p><p>Two instruction books, clearly set out with pictures of a female minifig with a magnifying glass looking at the parts you need for each step of the build. Book 1 deals with the main build and book 2 offering 2 alternate builds,a playground and a bedroom scene.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Three numbered bags, the first 2 for the main build the third bag being the ""extra bricks"". I guess its a for ""Juniors"" set as it has close to 50 2x bricks. If you like the ""Friends"" colour scheme you'll be happy with the pink, lime and lavender colours. 20 gold pieces befitting of any princess are included. Parts to note are the lavender slide, the 2 wall pieces in pink with printed decorations around the windows. Two modified corner tiles (Part 4610290) in white which&nbsp;I think&nbsp;are new plus two wierd new baseplates (Part 6055164) which I can't really see the point of. Okay they click together easily but you could do that with just standard plates. A few gems, a wand, flowers and a brush are included as is the obligatory brick seperator (why not make them in different colours to spice things up a bit?).</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>A princess in a dress with a nice print in blue, gold and pink and a grey pussycat.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>An easy build with the final model looking very nice from the front. In terms of playability its a bit questionable as the ladder on the side obscures one of the windows and the top part of the tower blocks the entrance to the slide. This is easily modified with the extra bricks to make an archway for the princess to access the slide and putting the turrets on top.The slide works well with the princess sliding down across the tiles at the bottom over her bridge and into the water which I suppose is a fun way to get out of your castle.</p><p>The alternate builds are very simple with the first just being a slide and a seesaw using less than a third of the total pieces in the set. The last build is even simpler with a bed, throne, vase and table for the pussys bowl.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>See above</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As it says it's ""easy to build"" and its strength lies in the ""build and rebuild"" potential. Although I would have preferred normal plates over the new ones which are a little limiting in my opinion. The set will complement the ""Friends"" sets and there is an add in the back of the instruction book for the Disney Princess sets with the line ""Create your own Fairytale"". With this in mind I'm not sure why Lego&nbsp;included a minifig instead of a mindoll.</p><p>â€¦</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4

<p>The box is a sturdy plastic container, which make a useful storage box for her own Lego (though we soon out grew it!)</p>

<h3>Parts &amp; Build</h3>

<p>A few interesting parts which I hadn&#39;t seen for a while (first time in a while I&#39;ve bought a set like this) - the slide, the base panels and the brick separator&nbsp;in particular was useful.</p>

<p>What was a little disappointing was that I picked up this set notably because it stated it was suitable for 4+. Now, I had to intention of just leaving this set with my daughter and letting her get on with it, but in my head, this set contained &#39;regular&#39; Lego, but made up of larger pieces which would be easier for her to put together herself, with direction from me. However, many of the pieces were just too small for her to handle / place accurately, and had to reply on my building most of it (whilst she was the &#39;part finder&#39;.</p>

<h3>Play</h3>

<p>Once complete, it kept my daughter busy for a good couple of hours playing with it. That would have been true had I got her 10667 - the construction set in the Juniors range, but certainly, having a princess to play in her castle - and having a slide in that castle - all fuelled the imagination, which is what it&#39;s all about.</p>
