He loves all kinds of kits, from the most basic entry-level ones like this &quot;LEGO Juniors&quot; one on up to the 700 piece kits intended for older kids.</p>

<p>Today at the store, he was having trouble choosing from among a handful of kits, and I urged him toward this one. He has shown zero interest in superheroes so far, which is fine because superheroes these days are too scary in their stories and demeanors for my kid. But with this kit, he&#39;s getting a very fun and gentle introduction to Batman and Robin. These guys are old-school Batman and Robin and they&#39;re very cute.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend this kit. It&#39;s good for kids like mine, who are beyond the skill level for this basic kit, but who still enjoy the whimsy and gentler themes provided by the Juniors line of LEGO kits. This kit would also be terrific if you have a little one just ready to start building kits that have instruction booklets they have to follow. The booklet is laid out differently in this kit than in other LEGO kits, with more concrete visual step-by-step instructions that are perfect for your beginner.</p>

<p>Two thumbs way up.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was a nice red design and looks bigger than most sets of a similar value are. (making one son feel he was getting the shaft with his &quot;smaller box&quot; set)</p>

<p>The instructions were well done.&nbsp; Great visuals showcasing each step and a how to build each bag at a time.&nbsp; There is even a clever way showing how to get a 3x3 piece out of&nbsp; the Batmobile&#39;s chassis in the event the set is taken apart.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set uses a wonderful colour scheme to contrast the usual Batman &quot;black, and very very dark grey&quot; colours with most of his regular sets.&nbsp; It&#39;s a nice change and pops out.<br />
Granted there are a quite a few &quot;juniorized&quot; pieces but there&#39;s suppose to be for a set of this caliber.&nbsp; One of the biggest bonuses is there are no stickers and all the pieces are PRINTED.&nbsp; It was a wonderful change for modern day Lego giving it an almost 80s feel.&nbsp; It&#39;s a wonder why LEGO would spend so much time printing on junior sets where they aren&#39;t exactly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This where the set really shines.</p>

<p>Batman - Unique to this set.&nbsp;&nbsp; He has the same dual grim face/smirk smile as any other Batman figure, but with an excellent Blue, Grey and yellow suit.&nbsp;&nbsp; The suit is perfect for anyone who grew up with a 60s to 80s Batman.</p>

<p>Robin - Again another unique piece.&nbsp; His colour scheme appears to be a Tim Drake era Robin with a classic Burt Ward hair style.&nbsp; I liked it how he had &quot;adult sized&quot; legs too.&nbsp; I would say he&#39;s the best figure of the set.&nbsp; He is &quot;borrowed&quot; from time to time by both his older brother and father alike.</p>

<p>Joker - Nothing new here a classic Joker in a purple suit with matching green hair.&nbsp; Still an excellent piece and a solid villain to have.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For a 3.5 year old the set was daunting.&nbsp; The car was right up his alley but by the time bag 2 arrived it was time for his older brother to finish up the set.&nbsp; Now that the 3.5 year old is getting closer to 4 he&#39;s fixing up any problems on his own or is just adding to the set with more ideas, exactly what a set like this should be for.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once finished the model is a site to behold.&nbsp; Batman&#39;s car can easily fit onto the main platform and aside for the BUR piece with another batarang. The whole set connects together and the jail and command center and easily be popped off to further expand the set down the road.&nbsp; The Joker&#39;s catapult can also really fling bombs and it&#39;s nice it comes with two bombs one for each hero.&nbsp; It may seem a bit silly but it&#39;s the Joker it should be silly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set. My son has played with it for hours and enjoys the jail cell most of all. Even with his older brothers bigger Batman cars and planes to play with he still insists that Batman drive the little Batmobile all the time.&nbsp; Which for me shows this is a beloved set.<br />
You also get value for the money you spend on it as a parent. It comes with a car, a base, two heroes and a great villian.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty much all you need in one box.<br />
The set is probably best for either a 4 year old with some background as a builder or a 5-6 year old who has never had a Lego set before, it&#39;s a perfect starter set. &nbsp; For my 3.5 year old it was a bit too much even with his Duplo background but with his older brother (and sometimes dad) to help out it was just right.<br />

"AyCarrumba","2015-11-15T12:38:32.32Z","Brilliant Batman and Robin and Joker Set!","<p>It was my sons 4th Birthday recently so of course Lego was order of the day. We picked this set up cheap on Amazon a while ago and kept it for the Birthday. We&#39;ve been playing the Lego Batman Computer game, so this is a nice Tie-In.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are great and with some encouragement my Son was able to build the Batmobile himself which he found very rewarding.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Lego Juniors sets obviously have a wealth of large single parts which quickly build into the sets shown. But they&#39;re actually very configurable and you can build quite a bit of other scenes or buildings with them, particularly along side other kits. There are lovely pieces in here like the flames for the back of the Batmobile, the Jail door and the brilliant printed computer screens and archway.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not a minifig hoarder, but this set could convert me. The detail in the 3 Minifigs (Batman, Robin and Joker) is wonderful. Each have 2 printed faces &#39;happy&#39; and &#39;angry&#39; (Does Twoface have 4?) and Robin and Batman have capes. They&#39;re also pretty much identical to the Computer Game Characters so my son has immediately identified with them and is playing out his own storylines. They also come with a good variety of props - Batarangs, a grappling hook, some dynamite for the Joker and the catapult and hammer! He&#39;s well equppied for mischief.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very rapid for any adult with Lego experience. I&#39;d say the level is set well for kids 4 and up and the nice thing is, they can get it &#39;wrong&#39; and still end up with a viable playset of their own creation. Parts aren&#39;t critical in placement and easily moved about. The Batmobile is very straightforwards and rewarding for a kid, and the Minifigs too. The scene will require adult help for young kids (4-5) if it&#39;s to look like it does on the box.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Just huge playability here. A vehicle, a working catapult (be prepared to chase the red bombs all around the floor) three great characters and the entrance to the &#39;Bat cave&#39;.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m really really impressed with this set. The use of the license is pitched just right, and of course this will last for years being built into bigger grander sets. I can see the figures being firm favorites. Recommended.</p>
