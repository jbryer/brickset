"samuraiturtle","2014-04-08T11:53:14.25Z","Tiger Claw","<p>This set is a tiger playing in a water fall. &nbsp;(A little know fact tigers do not mind getting wet.) &nbsp;The set comes with two new plant stalks. &nbsp;(And new to me, three &quot;muffins&quot; pieces.) &nbsp;Plus the tiger cub is new of course. &nbsp;It also comes with two arches in a purple, and a drum stick to feed the tiger. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The one thing I don&#39;t like about the set is the bow that goes on the tiger, I feel is should of been a crown. &nbsp;The bow makes tiger look to much like a female, with the crown you could at least imagine it was a king tiger. &nbsp;</p>

Why? Because of the pieces included, the nature of the model and the animal piece introduced here, let&rsquo;s move on to the pros and cons.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>This set has an awesome selection of parts, some gold topped ice cream pieces or something, gold studs, purple half-arch pieces, a clear blue brick as a waterfall or something and two of the nifty green plant pieces that resemble blades of grass.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The tiger animal is an awesome new animal piece that we will see again and again in LEGO Friends and even LEGO Elves.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The model is a uniform looking little palace with some nice nods to east Indian designs. It looks a lot more impressive than the Turtle&rsquo;s Little Paradise set.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Nothing to speak of here, it&rsquo;s really a great set with some great pieces.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I strongly recommend picking this set up if you haven&rsquo;t done so already this is one animal series set that is definitely worth owning. The model, the animal piece, even the small plate with the chicken leg attached for the tiger to eat all comes together for a great package. Don&rsquo;t miss out on this one while you can.</p>
