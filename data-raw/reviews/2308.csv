It'd be great to have a whole set in realistic castle colors that portrayed the Gryffindor tower, with sleeping  nooks and a study room and everything, but this set doesn't really do it.  What it did was make me wish I could create one, so maybe that's not a bad thing.

But I'm being a bit grouchy, because I'm really glad to have a whole bunch of accessories and pieces in odd colors, so just ignore my griping and pick this set up if you run across it.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This time it is a pair of small models that include a portion of the Gryffindor Common room complete with fat lady portrait and one of the beds in the boy's dormitory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all I'd have to say... well first of all I'd scratch my head briefly as I look at this set. Although I enjoyed all three of these odd sets because they came with interesting Mini-Figures, accessories and different colored bricks, I'd still have to scratch my head and try to figure out exactly what the purpose of this set was.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fat lady I believe was a sticker rather than a printed detail. The accessories for Ron were a wizard's hat in purple, a blue lightsaber blade for a magic wand, two magic books with spell ingredients, his pet rat Scabbers (AKA Peter Pettigrew) and a red suitcase. Ron also had a black cape and instead of Hogwarts uniform he was dressed in casual clothes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more I think about these sets the more I have to wonder if someone didn't just dream them up in the design phase as part of a preliminary model and then somewhere down the line someone just decided that would be that. Considering all of the lightsaber blade wands that were used in these sets as opposed to the more solid colors found in the traditional Harry Potter based sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model was a simple build, I especially liked the fact that it included cloth curtains and a yellow blanket for the Mini-Figure to use when sleeping, a rarity indeed for LEGO. Overall I'd have to say that this set is great for some pieces and accessories for MOCing, but it can easily be skipped over in your Harry Potter collection.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,3
"Wipipi","2017-09-03T17:00:45.313Z","Great Little Set!","<p>I personally really enjoy this set. I bought this new in its box around a year ago, and I am not disappointed. For some reason I&#39;ve always been attracted to this set. Now, onto the pros and cons.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>It was a very cheap set back in the day. For its&nbsp;price there is a lot of play that comes with the set.</li>
	<li>Many cool pieces come in this set. There&#39;re many colours, an exclusive cloth piece, some books, and even the printed fat lady piece! Lego would never include as many printed pieces in such a small set now of days. (Well, maybe in Junior sets)</li>
	<li>Cheap way to get Ron!</li>
	<li>There is a nice paper background.</li>
	<li>Brings tons of play value! Get bored with looking at the fat lady? Switch it over to a fireplace! Is Ron sleepy? You can tuck him to bed!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Unlike most of the Harry Potter sets from 2001-2002, this set cannot connect to other castle pieces, unless you bring customization into the picture.</li>
	<li>If you like accuracy, this set is not for you. There are&nbsp;a ton of bright colours that come with this set.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I believe this is a very nice set. If you have spare money and find this set for cheap and you like Harry Potter, I say go for it.</p>
