"Opticus86","2014-05-02T22:13:14.047Z","Macaws Fountain","<p>This&nbsp;beautiful Macaw sits on a tree stump between two green branches with cherrys&nbsp;and if he`s thirsty or wants to take a bath he can use the little fountain nearby.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It comes in the usual Polybag with instruction booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too special, beside two&nbsp;1x1x3 bright yellow pieces. Some nice&nbsp;colors, two&nbsp;transparent&nbsp;green pieces and a &quot;flame&quot; piece in transparent&nbsp;blue.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Macaw is definitely the highlight of this set, as his printing is unique and much nicer and more detailed than the former Friends birds which came in yellow and green! He actually looks very beautiful! :-)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Short and easy. The only interesting thing is the little fountain, which is build completely upside down.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks ok I guess.&nbsp;But in my opinion the series 4 sets were much more impressive, especially the &quot;Turtles little paradise&quot;.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you collect all the friends animals sets, of course you have to get this. But If you are looking for a small but nice gift, I`d recommend&nbsp;you to buy one of the other two sets of series 5 because they&nbsp;have definitely&nbsp;more playability than the macaws fountain.</p>

So what better animal piece to repaint and bring back for Animal Series 5. That&rsquo;s why this is a great little set, one of the reasons anyway. We&rsquo;ll cover the others in the pro/con list.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The bird sculpt is in a nice light blue colour with this set and has a beautiful looking print. It&rsquo;s a great looking re-use of this sculpt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The model in this set is a great take on a perch for the &lsquo;Macaw&rsquo;. It uses a lot of great pieces, light purple, lime green and more importantly the light cream or yellow bricks that look great and are another welcome new colour of brick from the Friends Theme.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Secondary model of water fountain for drinking is a nice mini build and uses radar dishes to great effect.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>There are no real cons to this set, with a few minor exceptions. The model may not be to everyone&rsquo;s taste, and as usual the bow for the animal just does not look good scale wise for the sculpted piece.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Strongly recommended. This is one of the great re-uses of animal parts as it adds another exotic bird for your menagerie. The model is fun, the mini-model fountain is a real treat and the inclusion of some rare brick pieces in great colours.</p>
