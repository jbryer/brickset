The Macaw was the only animal repeat, and what was introduced? It&rsquo;s very impressive, we&rsquo;re going to discuss the pros and cons of this set which hopefully will be a bit more than previous reviews.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The Orangutan is an awesome new animal sculpt, and it is new. While the design is very similar to the CMF Chimp we&rsquo;ve gotten in the past, this primate piece has a hole on the back for a bow and the arm is longer. Overall a great new sculpt.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model is a small tree with vines, flowers and a perch for the Orangutan to sit on. The build is pretty clever, the vine is an awesome use of the LEGO whip piece (which is green here) and the tree just looks pretty sweet.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Build is fun and relatively ok, with a few minor issues we&rsquo;ll bring up in the cons section.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price for the set is ok.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>No rare colours, the frond/tree leave pieces are fairly common these days in the lime green colour and this set does not feature many of the colours we&rsquo;ve come to expect in Friends sets.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Baseplate used for the tree is two half circle green pieces that are kept together by a lime green 2x2 rectangle plate. This might not seem like a con, but it is a weak element of the build due to the fact that the pieces separate easier than they should. Especially during construction when you push down on the trunk pieces causing the plate to let go of the half-circle plates. A more solid connection would be more appreciated.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Banana accessory included with set does not fit in Orangutan&rsquo;s hand.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>While there are a good number of cons with this set I would still recommend it. It&rsquo;s a cheap alternative to some of the larger Jungle Rescue sets and allows you to get the new Orangutan animal piece. While many fans of LEGO Friends will want to expand their animal collection, there are some who aren&rsquo;t such big fans because the animals do not blend well with other LEGO system sets. However I&rsquo;d say the animals still work nice, and as a bonus they will fit in well with both LEGO Friends, LEGO Disney Princess and LEGO Elves. I do kind of wish there more exotic colours though, there are many different colours in the jungles of the world and this set is a bit&hellip; plain&hellip; in comparison.</p>
