So many interesting new sculpts and interesting little habitat builds. It&rsquo;s almost like making your own LEGO Friends zoo. Let&rsquo;s move on to the pros and cons of this set.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Cute little bear cub sculpt for your LEGO Animal pieces collection.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model is a nice little build with a small tree, small cave opening for the bear cub to stand in. Nice light blue 4x5 plate for the river effect, great tiny waterfall build with fish jumping out to be caught.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Great value for your dollar here. Build is not difficult and instructions are serviceable.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Fish leaping out of water effect is made with a droid arm, doesn&rsquo;t fit the aesthetic very well and a flimsy attachment method for the fish.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Habitat build is fairly small and a bit busy, could have used wider base plates to space things out a bit more evenly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Bow looks ridiculous on bear cub&rsquo;s head, no bears would ever let you put a bow on them.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I dig this set as I feel the pros outweigh the cons and this is a nice cheap method of owning the bear cub animal piece. I would recommend this set to anyone interested in making a larger zoo display, as the small habitat would look great when incorporated into a MOC bear enclosure for a zoo in Heartlake City. It&rsquo;s also a nice parts pack for light blue plates for water effects and cheap to boot. Definitely recommended.</p>
