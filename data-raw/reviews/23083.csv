It&#39;s a theme that is a hard one to explain as the go-to response is &#39;It&#39;s Lego for Girls&quot;. I really hate that. Lego is for boys and girls and everyone else who wants to build! Needless to say, I find this set to be the most in-the-middle gender wise, and I&#39;ll explain why in my review of the Sunshine Harvest.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Apart from the stackability, I like the rounded edges of the Friends boxes. It draws attention to &#39;just another lego set&#39; in a sea of different sized boxes. I can only assume it slightly bumps up the price though :(</p>

<p>&nbsp;This particular one shows Olivia driving a tractor with a puppy in tow, bringing in a harvest of fruit and veggies to sell at her roadside stand. It does a good job of showing each section of the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The book is standard, instructions easy enough that it should only take a half hour if you&#39;re relaxing without a schedule.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I feel like in a&nbsp;<em>fresh new marketing campaign, years along in this theme&#39;s life,&nbsp;</em>they should post in big bold lettering, LOOKING FOR NEAT ARCHES OR CURVES FOR YOUR MOCs? LOOK TO LEGO FRIENDS SETS!</p>

<p>Seriously. In every set I&#39;ve bought from this line, there are always a great collection of arche and neat round elements for building. Lots of bright colours, with this collection in particular housing some bright aqua curves used in the tractor.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a sucker for anything food related in my lego, so I&#39;m glad to report to my other foodie-fans that this set is PACKED! I&#39;m talking printed round 1x1s&nbsp;with strawberries, a collection of apples and cherries, and even a carrot (with lots of extra toppers used as growing plants).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>?We get Olivia this time around, who has been in her fair share of Lego Friends sets. Pretty standard, but we do get a puppy to tag along at her heels in her chores. It&#39;s the same one as you may have gotten in Mias&#39; Puppy House (3934) and the Heartlake Dog Show (3942), but is a different paint job as the one you would have from Puppy&#39;s Playhouse (41025) in the Animal Series subtheme.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building itself is broken up into smaller jobs that don&#39;t connect as is mostly the norm for Friends. It&#39;s a little depressing as a fan of all kinds of themes when you compare what you make between them all, but par for the course.</p>

<p>The little flower basket though small is cute as a starter, and you make your way up through constructing a doghouse, garden patch, apple tree, and the Fruit Stand itself. The three end builds each have neat unique touches I&#39;ve not seen before, the veggies garden as a whole is just adorable and comes together nicely, the stand has those amazing strawberry printed tiles and when built is very 3 dimensional and immersive (not flat). The Tree is probably more basic once you&#39;ve built one or two along the way, but it uses a nice X plate that I&#39;ve not seen used (or can remember off the top of my head) in official builds to hold the branches together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Honestly I love this set (and if you were fortunate like myself in getting it as part of a promotion) for the pieces alone, they are bright and colourful and really pretty unique. A good number of them are present as well.</p>

<p>As for the positives, I gotta give it to the display on the Fruits Stand (the arch could use some work) and the garden. both are very well done and draw you in.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This theme as a whole irks me a little tiny bit more each wave, because I wish they would give us builds that had a bit more glue in them. I wish the parts in Sunshine Harvest had some way of connecting, if that&#39;s a&nbsp;</span>baseplate<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;that they share or some little scene with a pond that had some extra studs somewhere we could attach them to, I would gladly pay extra for it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">I really dislike how the theme dumbs down building for their demographic. Each step along this build only added one or two pieces most of the time, and I fully expect that anyone, boys or girls (men or women in my case), would be capable of a bit more meat to their builds.</span></p>

<p>Mostly that&#39;s a whole other discussion.... EXCEPT; I want to give Sunshine Harvest some props.</p>

<p>Out of all of the Friends sets that I&#39;ve built and bought, this one is a little unique, and thankfully will have some company as the newer jungle sets come out. Not only is Olivia seemingly working her own stand instead of working at a bakery or cafe, but she&#39;s doing all kinds of jobs. She&#39;s harvesting crops and tending apple trees and hauling it in and working a cash. That&#39;s a lot of work, and it bends a bit of the stereotypical gender roles which I like.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ENOUGH OF A RANT, this is a nice set and a decent price and a not bad price-per-brick. I reccommend!</p>
