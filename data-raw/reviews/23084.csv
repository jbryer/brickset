That being said let&#39;s discuss this set from the 2014 Friends Theme, the new format for writing reviews also doesn&#39;t have a template for Pro and Con lists, but that shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to write up without one.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The Lemonade Stand is an impressively fun simple build with some great buildable accessories to decorate it. The colours are also a nice feature and the details in the stand look like something a mini-doll might build out of materials found around the house.</li>
	<li>The juice squeezer is a great looking microbuild.</li>
	<li>Printed studs for cookies, buildable pastries and a crate filled with Lemons and Limes.</li>
	<li>New Scooter vehicle is great fun and works for delivering the lemonade or just riding to the store to pick up more supplies. The colours work well too and the helmet is a great safety feature accessory.</li>
	<li>Mia is an excellent looking Mini-Doll with some great printing, a bow accessory for her hair and is all around fun.</li>
	<li>Printed tile with Lemonade on it, great for MOCs.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Helmet does not feature molded ponytail in back, making Mia look like Charlie Brown when she&#39;s wearing it.</li>
</ul>

<p>I can honestly say that this set has very few cons, and in my view makes for an excellent parts pack and set to sit outside the Tree House or Olivia&#39;s House sets for passerby Mini-Dolls to partake in some fresh lemonade on a hot summer day.<br />
The only con I listed is also more of a nitpick honestly, but one that I find to be justifiable, if the riding hats the Friends Mini-Dolls wear can have molded ponytails&nbsp;so they don&#39;t look weird when wearing them than why can&#39;t the bike helmets offer a similar feature?</p>

<p>For the price of this set and what you do have here though I strongly reccomend it.</p>
