<p>This is a good set. It includes 1 minifigure. Some special parts include the dolphin, orange flippers (if that&#39;s what you call them), seastar, suitcase, binoculars, and bucket. The shorts on Emma are very unique and rare. This set is a nice build, but in my opinion the instructions are too simple, showing you how to build the set brick by brick. Overall, this is a unique set.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-12-15T21:38:41.863Z","Join Emma on the Beach","<p><strong>Set #41028 Emma&rsquo;s Lifeguard Post: </strong>It&rsquo;s that time again, another 12.99$ LEGO Friends set review, and what a set this is. Not only does it include Emma as a lifeguard, but you get some nice pieces in great colours and an awesome animal piece quite cheaply. It&rsquo;s a great 2014 Friends set, read on to find out why.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Like most Friends boxes this one is a great purple colour showcasing the set with some impressive photo work. The front has a really nice shot of Heartlake Beach with Emma&rsquo;s post sitting on the water&rsquo;s edge. While the back shows off all of the fun elements used as play features in the set.</p>

<p>The manual is your typical manual for a set this size, with simple and easy to follow steps as well the standard cross-promotional images of other Friends sets in the wave. Plus a nifty checklist in the back for the sets, the mini-dolls and the animals you get with this wave of 2014 sets.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>You get a lot of lovey lavender parts in this set, plates, sloped roof bricks and a sweet pink backpack. There&rsquo;s also a large transparent clear pink umbrella piece, some orange flippers and some nice blue pieces for water effects. Great parts in here.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Emma: The mini-doll in this set features the shorts sculpt for the legs in a pink colour and includes a top with a printed swim-suit top and a whistle on a chain for the lifeguard. She also gets a pair of gold binoculars, the red whatchamacallit piece from the CMF Theme for lifeguards and a dark pink bow for her hair.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s an effective combination of Mini-Doll parts and includes some great accessories. She also includes a pair of orange flippers and a green briefcase, which I&rsquo;m assuming is being used here for a first aid kit.</p>

<p>The set also includes a dolphin in it, this is the cheapest means of getting this animal piece, since it&rsquo;s only found in the Dolphin Cruiser. It&rsquo;s great to see it here at this price point for fans of dolphins who can&rsquo;t afford the cruiser.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build is used to make three models, each one is quick and easily built without any tricks to it. The lifeguard post build is the most involved and includes some nice steps for making it appear to be on the water&rsquo;s edge at the beach.</p>

<p>Not much more to say in regards to the build, it works great and offers a quick set of models to play with.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The lifeguard post itself is a nifty looking build, with some impressive tricks for appearing to be on the water&rsquo;s edge. The small ladder for getting up to the post is a red version of a common piece found in most Star Wars sets. The use of the window piece for the open back window without glass panes or shutters is fairly obvious, but looks great, especially with the white bricks beside it and the bridge used to make a nice side arch to look through and spot trouble from the distance.</p>

<p>The smaller model of a sand castle with an umbrella for shade is pretty simple, compared to the sand castle build in Olivia&rsquo;s Speadboat, however the two models complement each other nicely. And if you owned both sets they&rsquo;d look perfect as a little beach display, maybe with the small Water Scooter Fun set added in for good measure.</p>

<p>The third build is just a buoy, not much to say about it. Except it has a very nice dark green flag on the top.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I strongly recommend this set for LEGO Friends fan, it&rsquo;s a great build and features some nice use of parts to make the lifeguard post. The inclusion of the dolphin is also great for fans of that animal who want one, but can&rsquo;t get the Dolphin Cruiser at the moment. Emma looks gorgeous in this set as well, I do wish LEGO would make a proper bikini bottom leg piece for mini-dolls, if only for decent play features as swimming in shorts, while done just doesn&rsquo;t look like it would be practical for a lifeguard, or comfortable in my opinion. I also need to wonder why LEGO City harbour sets get LEGO life saver pieces, but LEGO Friends sets have printed circular tiles for the life preservers.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a cardboard rectangle, and has some papers with pictures on it inside. :-)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some rare pieces&nbsp;are the rescue floaty, mini suitcase, and pink swim shorts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Emma&nbsp;is wearing&nbsp;a blue bikini top (yucky!!!) and pink shorts and a hot pink bow in her hair.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It at least took 10 minutes and was very easy and very cute.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think it looks like a real&nbsp;lifeguard&nbsp;post. The dolphin was a good addition, and adds play value. She could rescue the dolphin, or you could combine it with 3061 and they can have dolphin burgers! :-P</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s incredible. You must buy it&nbsp;(or I&#39;ll sneak into your house at night and make you!!!) :-)</p>
