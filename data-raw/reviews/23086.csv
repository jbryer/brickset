What we're looking at is Stephanie who's taking care of a new born lamb. The lamb is making it's first appearance in the Friends arena of animals. Among the hedgehogs, ponies, cats, dog puppies and squirrels (I'm probably forgetting a few) this lamb surely is the cutest. Without any doubt young girls will love it!</p>
<h3>Box/Instructions</h3><div>The box is fairly big given the small amount of parts but it's design is nice, like all other Friends sets I've seen. The instructions are in a small folded booklet and easy to follow.</div><p></p>
<h3>Parts</h3><div>The dominating colors in this set are magenta, white and yellow. I think it is the first time we see the 1x6 brick and 1x2x5 brick in magenta.&nbsp;</div><p></p>
<h3>Minifigures</h3><div>We're getting another Stephanie. Not much to say here.</div><p></p>
<h3>The build</h3><div>With only 1-3 items added per step, we build a small stable with a straw bed for the lamb. The lamb is apparently abandoned by her (his?) mother and this is why we find two feeding bottles in the set. One is transparent, the other white: representing an empty and full bottle of milk. There's a pink tub and a stand with a water tap for Stephanie to scrub the little lamb clean. Three brushes, a comb and a spray bottle are among the utensils at its disposal.</div><p></p>
<h3>The completed model</h3><div>Again a lovely looking set for the Friends lovers!</div><p></p>
<h3>Overall opinion</h3><div>Cute, well designed, attractive color-scheme and a lamb looking at you with an expression which makes your heart melt. Definitely a great gift for any young girl and a good one for AFOL's as well. It's also a much better set than <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=41003-1""><b>41003</b></a> <i>Olivia's Newborn Foal</i> that appeared earlier in 2013.</div><p></p>",TRUE,1,5,3,5,4
