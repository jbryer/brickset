Just brought this beauty home and put it together while cooking dinner. Here are a few comments to help you decide if it is the set for you.<div><br></div><div>The colors rock right off the table; lime green with two shades of orange and pink, bright light yellow, and more. A blast of pastels are perfect for our sunless, dreary, winter storm day.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The accessories are first class. My favorites are the new printed pineapple, drink blenders, citrus press, and Naya the newest Friend.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The design is also a winner with lots of glass walls to make the interior bright and visible.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>This is a happy set; build it and have fun is what it screams. Maximum playability? Have a big party for all the Friends and their Friends and invite a few regular figs they have not yet met. Meet you there for one of my famous mango smoothies!</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

I&nbsp;think it&#39;s a great idea to build it with a friend which I did, and we had lots of fun.&nbsp;This is great for six to twelve year-olds as it is fun and exciting to build. I hope I gathered enough info for you to decide if you want to get it or not.</p>
