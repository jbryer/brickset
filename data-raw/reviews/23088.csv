"CherryRose","2015-10-12T17:03:34.673Z","It's a typical set, but it's still a great one. ","<p>Maybe we&#39;ve seen a ton of similar houses in the line. There&#39;s probably better ones than this objectively. That doesn&#39;t detract from this set, it&#39;s still very good in just about every category, and I can&#39;t say there&#39;s anything I dislike about it.</p>

<h3>The Minidolls</h3>

<p>In this set you get 2 figures, Stephanie and Kate. Stephanie is one of the core Friends, and has appeared in many sets before, but this time is sporting a green tanktop and sandals, along with a brand-new ponytail with a sun visor, because you know, the eyes. Kate was brought over here from 41000 and is pretty much identical, but gives the set someone to hang out with. Both, however, are still pretty generic and are desgined to be customizable, so if you want you could swap around their clothes and hairstyles as you please. (Come to think of it, that&#39;s a terrible idea, that would just mish-mash their skin colors. At least you got a crate of bows for them)</p>

<h3>As a Playset</h3>

<p>Despite being significantly smaller than both Olivia&#39;s and Emma&#39;s houses, it still offers just as much and both of those while still adding it&#39;s extra flare of being on the seaside. There&#39;s plenty of space on the shore for swimming, or you could use the included wind board to go out even further until you capsize because of how hard it is to use those darn things. And then when you&#39;re done with that, you can go shower up in the bathroom, and enjoy fruit and cocktails out on the patio. And at night, after watching your favorite tv show on the convertible couch, there&#39;s plenty of space on the balcony to gaze at the stars.</p>

<h3>As a Display Model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice looking building overall, and while maybe you won&#39;t find it realistic in the slightest, it makes it clear what it is and offers completely reasonable proportions, but with the help of it&#39;s subdued yet cheery colors and lots of windows to give it it&#39;s brightness, it feels like it&#39;s substantial enough. Even from the inside, it looks quite presentable, completely furnished with a bar-style kitchen and a nice and cozy living area. Throw in some greenery to liven up the place, and an actual way to get between stories (note to Lego: you need to do this more), it&#39;s simple beauty.</p>

<h3>As a Building Experience</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve built any other Friends set before, I think you should have a good idea on how the build works. It&#39;s separated into 4 numbered stages. First an elevated base on the dock is built using large 8x16 and 16x16 plates, which is pretty obvious, but helps this house legitimately feel like it&#39;s above the coastline and give some depth to the floor. The seconds bag continues with the structure of the first floor, which comes from the panels, windows and other longs bricks, with the 2nd floor being all of the same, and like other sets is modular and can be rearranged to get an even more outdoor area. Long story short, it&#39;s just like every other set, but is fun regardless.</p>

<h3>As a Parts Pack</h3>

<p>While no new molds are included as far as I know, much of the set is made up of white and cool yellow bricks and panels, which make a welcome return from the Heartlake High and feels just as welcoming and happy as it&#39;s always been, and for such a rare color, getting huge panels worth of it is great. What&#39;s also gret to get in huge panels? The barred windows, which are really great to quickly build up structures while avoiding the bulk. There&#39;s also a good amount of little things: fruit, flowers, that silly little toilet bowl, the stickered TV screen, and the specialized wind board are just a few.</p>

<h3>Overall Value</h3>

<p>It isn&#39;t groundbreakingly original, but it is quite consistent in both style and quality with the rest of the line, being great as both a standalone thing for girls to have a good time with relatable experiences, or as part off a full-sized town layout. I would easily reccommend this set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a box. Enough said.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has a cool surfboard, a purple roof with a smooth surface, and a cool toilet piece (cause everybody loves toilets!) (:</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Kate is wearing&nbsp;a purple bikini top (inapropro!!!)&nbsp;and Stephanie has a pink hat and a green shirt and a towel around her waist.............. O: What is under the towel?!?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It took 35 minutes to build, and I thought it was kinda&nbsp;hard but i is worth the time.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks like a real beach house, and I play with it almost every day (not every day, I have a life, peoples!!!)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>You must buy this set. Even if you&#39;re a 40 year old trucker. You will not regret it!!!</p>
