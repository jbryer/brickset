Look at the photo on the box carefully and I'm sure you can find 2 or 3 parts or more that you do not own in any set. The cardboard backdrop is pretty useless, I keep it in the box so it wouldn't get damaged in future building and rebuilding. Buy this for the pieces!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2011-05-05T22:36:45.7Z","Diagon Alley Shops Review","<p>Looking at the coloring schemes for this set, I'm reminded of why I didn't jump for this one or a couple of other Harry Potter sets with the pastels and garish clashing colors. Lets add in next that flimsy cardboard backing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set's greatest value and assets though are the ammount of accessories and what you can do with them for MOCs and using them in other designs. Broom, capes, books, hats, wands, bottles, cat, rat, frog, scorpion, owl. Money chest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in the excitment that there's the huge Diagon Alley set out for 2010, the excitment of wanting this smaller set for consideration with filling out the larger is somewhat high.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-11T13:07:45.133Z","Welcome to Diagon Alley","<p>Set #4723 Diagon Alley Shops: The last of the three curiosities, this set is definitely one you should own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Diagon Alley Shops gave you the pieces to build two models. One was a supply store filled with wands, magic potions, crystal balls, books, capes and even a broom. The other was a familiar store, where you could buy owls, rats, cats or frogs. (Or if you'd prefer something truly wild a transparent orange scorpion.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set gave you a lot of fun and interesting pieces, it toned down the pink and orange of the previous two sets in favor of a more muted white uniform color scheme with some green bricks and plates to throw in a dash of color. It also is to my knowledge the only set to ever include a transparent pink treasure chest. (I rather wish now I hadn't parted with it when I sold the other sets... But then again I rather wish I hadn't parted with any of them now that I see bare shelves everywhere without a single HP set to be had for the new 2010 stuff.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this set is a very good set to own for MOCers, LEGO collectors who enjoy interesting and unique pieces, and even Harry Potter fans who want to enhance the rest of their Diagon Alley shops. (Which LEGO made available later on.) It truly is a set among sets. (And you can never have too many transparent colored arachnids.) Also this is the only set I believe to offer Hermione in street clothes. (At least the only cheap one.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
