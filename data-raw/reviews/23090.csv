<p>Gracie managed to complete the set within about 35 mins and enjoyed building it. As Gracie is under the advised age of the set there were a couple of tricky parts that she took longer with but she loves to complete these by herself and followed it through well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall Gracie gave it a 5 out of 5 so she is happy!</p>

<p>?Parents say &quot;We managed to get this from a local Smyths store in the UK for &pound;13.49 so a bit of a bargain, great value at that price.&quot;</p>

"mr_piggle","2016-05-30T22:05:21.323Z","Breaking News: Another Great Set from Lego","<p>With all of the happenings around Heartlake, a citizen of the town might find it difficult to stay in the know and keep current. Good thing there&#39;s the Heartlake News van to motor around town capturing all of the breaking news events for citizens! In this set, Emma and Andrew take Heartlake&nbsp;News van to a cake decorating competition to deliver the sweet news that a giant cake has taken the top prize. What breaking story will they cover next? Perhaps some goings on at an Amusement Park...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a medium-sized set, packaged in all of the usual Friends finery. Same graphic design as usual, shades of purples and portraits of the five core Friends shroud the main product shot of Emma on the scene at the Cake Competition, with Andrew hard at work working the camera for the live shot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back of the box shows the usual &quot;what&#39;s inside&quot; as well as a quick diagram of the various parts of the minidoll, a portrait of Emma, and four &quot;action shots&quot; of the News Van&#39;s play features. There&#39;s a make up station for Emma to get camera ready, a workstation for either of the figures to edit and produce their news, and studio equipment such as a desk, light, and weather map.</p>

<p>Inside the box are two numbered bags and two instruction booklets, a sticker sheet, and the loose plate that forms the&nbsp;bottom of the van.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set contains 278 pieces and retails for $24.99, though many individuals have found it on clearance, bringing the fair 9 cents/per piece even lower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as hard to find pieces go, there are some bright purple inverted roof slopes that aren&#39;t located in too many places. The medium azure&nbsp;fenders are something I wish I had more than four of, but aside from those two highlighted pieces, everything else is pretty standard&nbsp;fare and generally common, though certaintly&nbsp;useful for other builds.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Included with the Heartlake News Van are Emma and Andrew. Emma is meant to be the on-screen personality, and Andrew is the camera operator. I have heard rumblings from other Lego fans that a female minidoll should be the one sitting at the computer console working on editing the news story, and to them I say, why says Emma can&#39;t do that?</p>

<p>While Andrew the minidoll does show up in the Dolphin Cruiser (in the same shirt, he must have a spare or a good handle on laundry), male minidolls are still relatively rare in the Friends world and I think it&#39;s nice he&#39;s included here. Not because a female isn&#39;t brainy enough to figure out how to drive a news van, edit a news piece, or hold a camera, but because a little diversity is nice. It&#39;d be nice if Andrew came with some hair to swap out for the ballcap, but bald Andrew is fine.</p>

<p>Emma looks on-screen fancy in her tied off jacket and skirt, and her make up table suggests that all a girl needs is a good hair brush and a swipe of lipstick to be at her best. Why not. And for the record, she totally drives the van.</p>

<p>Snark aside, these are two great looking minidolls that suit this set very nicely and carry the theme of news production well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is in a couple of stages. First the accessories are built, the weather map, the news desk and chair, the studio lamp, the giant cake, and finally the van itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The van is built over the remainder of the first instruction book and the entirety of the second. It is not a complex build, as usual the only tricky part is sticker placement since precision is fairly important in the van decals.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks sharp and accurate. Initially I was concerned with the amount of bright purple (I perceive it as pink) that was going into the build forming the lower portion of the van. The medium azure is a brilliant color choice, and anyone who is also concerned about the &quot;pinkness&quot; could easily swap those bricks with something else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model feels very cohesive and thought through. The satellite dish on the top is a sharp addition, and for storage&#39;s sake I added the studio light to the top, keeping in mind the live shoot trucks I see around town shooting in dim lighting. There are also spots to store the small chair (in front of the computer) and the news desk (in front of the makeup table) if need be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact that the roof opens and the side swings open is a very intelligent design choice on the part of the designer, making the model more accessible and play-oriented, allowing those who choose to play with this model to make creative choices beyond just what is included with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>On the whole, I am in favor of this set and give it high marks. It is a creative set that highlights different career choices for youngsters aside from those that are highly represented in the Friends universe. There are also many opportunities for creative play and for social scripting as youngsters play with this set, as they can create newscasts not just about the cake, but&nbsp;over happenings at the stables, veterinary clinic, fashion studio, pop star&#39;s house, and so forth. The opportunities are endless. And the design quality is high, it&#39;s accessible and attractive, and quite a good value.</p>
