At so little, so much is included!<div>* Figs: The Nindroid is so awesome! He has a black head with metal detailing on it. great eyes, too. Cole TR ( Techno Robes) Is cool. He has a new part as a mask, a great hairpiece and super detaling! 9/10 on Figs.</div><div>* Playabilty: The saw blade is my favourite part of the set. As you roll the hunter along the ground, the saw will spin fast or slow. The rubber tire moves the saw. You also get flick missiles. 10/10 on Abilty!</div><div>* Value for $: 12.99 is a bit overpriced. I think it should be at least 7.99. 7/10 on price.</div><div>* Overall: Overall, i give the set 10/10, cause i love the figs, the detail and play features! This is a definet reccomend for all you Ninjago fans!</div>",FALSE,5,4,5,4,5
"Wall_e2624","2014-01-24T22:10:29.747Z","Nindroids seem to have a thing for saws...","<p>The Hover Hunter is the smallest set in the Ninjago Rebooted wave. Last year we had Kai&#39;s Fire Mech, which&nbsp;was at the same price point as this and was one of the standouts of the wave. So can this set step&nbsp;into the shadow of Kai&#39;s Fire Mech?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box depicts Cole attacking the Hover Hunter with his green Techno Blade. Not overly exciting but enough to convince the passing child to buy it. The back doesn&#39;t show any play features, just another fight scene between Cole and the Nindroid. Also in the bottom left corner is the Techno Blade &#39;checklist&#39;. The one included in this set is number 1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The front cover of the instructions uses the blueprint design that I loved in the NinjaCopter. The book has 22 pages of building.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For a small set there are some nice pieces. Particularly the angled plate in Medium Lilac. It is also nice to see the ninja half-mask in black, which is probably the most useful colour for the piece, in the smallest set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has two minifigures. None of them are exclusive to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cole: In this set, Cole dons his Techno Robes and they look very nice. He has the same hair that was first seen on the Collectible Minifigures S1 Skater. The printing on the robes is amazing. The little details like the cracks and earth on his robes are just excellent. I am a little disappointed at the lack of printing on his legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nindroid: The Nindroid drone is the same as the one included in the NinjaCopter set. He has excellent printing on his head and torso but his legs have no printing. He is still a nice looking figure that will look nice in a Nindroid army.</p>

<p>Accessory wise, the only real one is Cole&#39;s Techno Blade. However the two blades on the back of the Hover Hunter can be detached and used as weapons for the Nindroid.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was not too exciting. The only interesting part was when you build the spinning blade play feature. I am pleased to report there are no stickers in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is not too exciting. It is essentially a flat plate a saw at the bottom. The way the saw feature works is pretty cool. A wheel is placed under the saw, so when the wheel moves, it rotates the saw. I reckon it is alright but not a standout.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set sadly does not live up to Kai&#39;s Fire Mech. The figures are great but none are exclusive to this set. It is a good army builder for Nindroids and a vehicle for them. Like the NinjaCopter, this set might only appeal to fans of Ninjago. Not the best set in the wave, but still not terrible.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-04T21:15:33.247Z","Ninja's vs. Nindroids. Rebooted is Fun.","<p><strong>Set #70720 Hover Hunter:</strong> Ninjago Rebooted, the new adventures of our favorite ninja. And what should be their first enemy than cyborg entities controlled by an evil Overlord bent on wiping out all of Ninjago City. Yep created based on Zane&rsquo;s blueprints, that means that the new season focuses more on Zane I think, or it should at any rate.</p>

<p>Are the new sets of 2014 a match for the old sets? Are they worth picking up? Will Ninjago City be destroyed? Well you&rsquo;ll have to watch the cartoon to find out that last part, but read on to discover the opinions of this LEGO reviewer concerning the first part.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box design is heavily focused on Zane, which I mentioned in my previous review. Considering that for the past two years it&rsquo;s been all about Lloyd and the year prior to that was I believe more focused on Kai (as he was the one chosen to be on all the boxes) it&rsquo;s nice to see the focus go to some other character here. The box for such a small set does it&rsquo;s job nicely, it showcases the set and features an eye catching design that is sure to make the targeted age range want them all.</p>

<p>Again the instructions look interesting, they feature a blueprint booklet cover design and the interior shows the build steps straightforwardly and without too much difficult. For a set of this size and this piece count that isn&rsquo;t too difficult. On the back few pages you see pictures of all the sets from this wave except the Target/LEGO store exclusive Destructoid set, a minifigure checklist for the wave and the back inside cover shows the link to the newly revamped Ninjago site where you can find all your LEGO information and play fun flash games.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Aside from a few purple plates and the large saw blade this set has very few parts that stand out, considering this set only has 79 pieces that&rsquo;s not too surprising, sets of this size rarely have rare parts.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>You get two minifigures in this set and both are interesting, though I find the enemy minifigure a bit more impressive than the ninja mostly because of the unique printing going on with him.</p>

<p>Nindroid Drone: With a name like that expect to want to army build this little dude. He has a double-sided torso print that really enhances the cyborg nature of the Nindroids. With wires and tubes and everything you&rsquo;d expect to be. There are no leg printing unfortunately; the facial print makes up for this looking menacing and with metal plating on the front and back of the head. He has no headgear and his accessories are a part of the model so we&rsquo;ll discuss them later.</p>

<p>Cole ReBooted: The Ninja of Earth is upgraded once more, his torso print reflects this new look with a double-sided torso that combines some past elements and showcases a few new elements. It&rsquo;s a very busy looking torso print that I&rsquo;m not really a fan of, on top of that the Ninja from this wave have lost their leg printing, which has been something they&rsquo;ve had for a while now and I&rsquo;m not a fan of losing details like that. This new ReBooted look could benefit from some leg printing honestly.</p>

<p>Another thing the ninja have abandoned is their full facial covering masks, instead they&rsquo;re using the CMF bandana to cover their mouths and get brand new hair pieces. This is semi-good, it&rsquo;s good because now the ninja have their unique hair styles as seen on the show. It&rsquo;s unfortunate because the full masks make them look more like ninja and these face covering bandanas are more bandits than ninja. (Incidentally, like Lloyd you get two of the bandana in case you lose one, or want to MOC more minifigs with them.)</p>

<p>Cole&rsquo;s accessory is the collect&rsquo;em all fetch quests of this sub-theme, the techno blades. This one is more like a chain whip with a dangerous blade on the end, it kind of reminds me of the whip from Castlevania, if the Belmonts decided to attach a deadly blade on the end. I&rsquo;m not sure what to make of this weapon, it&rsquo;s cool looking granted, unfortunately it does tend to make Cole top heavy unless he&rsquo;s attached to studs.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build of this set is a fast funky looking vehicle that has a massive saw blade on the front. There isn&rsquo;t much to it and it isn&rsquo;t difficult or tricky at all, also I didn&rsquo;t notice much in the way of clever or impressive build techniques. I have to admit though, the vehicle build lends itself well to army building, five or six of them together would make a decent looking display. It&rsquo;s also great for building in the car ride home&hellip; As long as you&rsquo;re careful and don&rsquo;t lose any pieces on the floor.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Hover Hunter vehicle is a pretty minimalistic model; the thing is like a giant open-aired land speeder, if you know the landspeeder from Star Wars was designed to slice everything in its path in half or something.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s got some nice looking design choices, the control seat is protected by two bladed weapons attached above the chair and two larger blades attached next to the engine intakes/outtakes near the control pad. The two small blades are used as the accessories for the drone, and it&rsquo;s interesting that you can angle these things like a seatbelt if you wanted. I like the simplicity and deadly look of this vehicle, it&rsquo;s a fun vehicle to play with and the gimmick of the rolling wheel that rotates the large saw blade works much better than the smaller blades on the OverBorg vehicle.</p>

<p>The vehicle also has two flick-fire missiles, which I think are a slightly bit awkwardly placed for proper functionality. They still work, but not as well as other sets, mostly because the vehicle is way too small and their placement is in a place that prevents you from accessing them while rolling after Cole. The last thing to note is that this set has printed elements for details instead of stickers, a welcome change from the larger set I reviewed previously.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d have to say that this set is worth picking up in duplicate form for army building the vehicle and the Nindroid Drone for an army of the dudes. I like Cole for what he is, however I wish LEGO had kept the leg printing for the ninja; since it was what they had from the very beginning and I kind of miss it in the newer ninja minifigures. Strongly recommended little set.</p>

"brickman3","2014-08-01T00:42:05.93Z","Awesome mini set!","<p>Replace this text with your introduction. You can insert images into your reviews: click on the Image icon. Please make sure they are less than about 500px wide.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a little small, which I normally don&#39;t like about Lego sets. However, it is a theme I like, so I will let it slide.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There weren&#39;t that many parts, only about 80. But small is the new mighty, as I say.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Only 2 Minifigures normally doesn&#39;t make me happy. But with the TYPE of characters: Cole Rebooted, and the Nindroid Drone, it makes the set seem like the show!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build only took me about 10 minutes to build, which isn&#39;t very long. However, it is an extraordinary yet small set! I just wish it were bigger...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is really cool when done. Here are some spoilers:&nbsp;&nbsp; Comes with 2 flick missiles, and the big blade moves on a flat surface, due to what is underneath. Also, the seatbelt blades are the Nindroid&#39;s weapon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a really interesting set. It may be small, yet there is so much you&nbsp;can do with it!</p>
