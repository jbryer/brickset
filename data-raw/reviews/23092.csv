The cockpit assemble is very sleek, and the bottom is pretty slick and well finished for an official set also. For a 200 pc build, I am very impressed - you can really see the Lego designers are using a lot more master-builder techniques these days.<div><br></div><div>The minifigs are solid: the Ninja hero has great anime-style big hair over a facemask, instead of the headwrap all the ninjas used to wear. The cyborg villian is fantastic; I would rate him as possibly the most sinister &amp; ""bad"" looking minifigs of all time.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall great set, fun to build, look at, and very swooshable.</div>",TRUE,5,3,4,4,4

<p>As always the box looks great and does a good job of selling the set.<br />
Instructions are spot on and the blue cover choice is very nice surprise when you first empty box contents.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Apart from the 2 2 x 1 black slopes no other new parts but this set does contain a slew of very useful ones including 2 x red &quot;Jedi starfighter&quot; winglets, red 4 x 2 tiles etc so worth buying for parts alone.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Excellent minifigs, I usually on-sell Ninjago and Chima minifigs but I am keeping the 2 from this set for sure. As mentioned in previous review the Cyborg is excellent and very menacing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nice build, lots of SNOT techniques. The swing wing mechanism is a real treat&nbsp; as it is a very clever yet simple design.<br />
The only issue I had is lack of cockpit controls. This is made worse by the inclusion of a perfect 2 stud spot in front of the pilot which is ideal to place 2 gear levers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great, loads of swooshability, any young boys out there will spend hours playing with this one. I would actually consider buying 2 so there is always a wing man!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very nice set, some of the 2014 Chimas have been very disappointing so this set is a welcome hit.<br />
Highly recommended to AFOLS due to the strong collection of parts for the bin and highly recommended for kids as heaps of playability.<br />
<br />
Also of note is the quality of plastic in the box I purchased.<br />
In some sets the plastic feels slightly off and even cheap (might be a southern hemisphere thing?) but this box had very high quality plastic that felt just right and has the certain sparkle of quality!<br />
<br />
Cheers!!</p>

<p>The minifigs are solid. Techno blade Kai and General Kryptor. But it is the plane that is far better in the hand than the pictures give hint of. There are some fascinating builds, such as how the oddly angled engine intakes are achieved.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just a fun worthwhile set without any real flaws.</p>
