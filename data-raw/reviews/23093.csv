"Dragon_Master_48","2013-12-26T03:53:30.857Z","This Set, Unfortunately, Is Not Greater Than the Sum of Its Parts","<p><b>70722 OverBorg Attack</b>&nbsp;is one of the new sets in the ""Ninjago Rebooted"" storyline, and it's quite a fascinating one.&nbsp;At first, I was worried that Lloyd's motorcycle would just be a miniaturized form of Kai's Blade Cycle from 2012, but it actually turned out to be an interesting little vehicle. Unfortunately, the same does not apply to OverBorg's vehicle, or the sparse scenery present in the set. While the green trash can was fun to have, the ramp was not so fun, and felt like it was just intended to take up pieces (as if there was a certain necessary ""minimum piece count""), because it is barely functional beyond display, and serves as more of a speed bump for Lloyd rather than a ramp.</p><p>OverBorg's spider-crawler has a very cool design, but I personally would have preferred if its arms were longer- in this set, there were plenty of spare parts (a few katanas), but not any pieces to extend those arms. I'm not sure if you would consider it part of his minifigure (as an accessory of sorts), but in my opinion, it's probably the best designed part of this set.</p><p>One thing I found somewhat fun about this set was the build. I enjoyed every part except putting the treads and stickers on, but I noticed that there seem to be two pieces on OverBorg's vehicle (on the inside, that become nearly inaccessible once you place the tread on) that seem to have no use...?</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Exclusive Cyrus Borg/OverBorg minifigure, and rare Lloyd.</li><li>A few purple pieces and others parts good for rebuilding.</li><li>Interesting build, though not necessarily challenging.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Scenery included is quite unnecessary, and the extra pieces could have been used to improve the set.</li><li>OverBorg's vehicle looks weird, especially when he's on it.</li><li>Arms on OverBorg's vehicle do nothing but get in the way of moving and holding the vehicle. It makes the vehicle look more like a street sweeper than a destructive weapon.</li><li>Lazily tacked on ""spikes and blades"" on OverBorg's vehicle.</li><li>STICKERS!!</li></ul><div>I think this set would've been better at a larger size (and perhaps a $25 or $30 price tag to fit the part increase) in order to fully flesh out both vehicles and the scenery (and certainly make a better ramp!). I wouldn't go as far to necessarily describe this set as the black sheep of the Ninjago 2014 wave, as I personally enjoyed it, but it's not exactly the best either.</div>
<p>Overall, I would only recommend this set to Ninjago collectors who want an interesting set (but don't like the other ones, or can't afford the more expensive ones), rebuilders who most likely will only bother building the main set once or twice, or younger kids who probably won't be as critical of this set as I am.</p><p>For a $20 price tag, I suppose (and assume, at least from my perspective) many people might enjoy 70721 more, but this set is still an interesting little thing, and for collectors, it's certainly always one to be considered, and not overlooked.</p>",TRUE,3,4,4,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2016-07-04T21:18:07.9Z","OverBorg is OverBuilt and OverComplicated.","<p><strong>Set # 70722 OverBorg Attack: </strong>It&rsquo;s now 2014 and we&rsquo;re about to see the Ninjago world ReBooted, meaning that things will change and new characters appear. This means new enemies. Yep the Nindroids are the enemies of this year and the Ninja have their work cut out for them having to put a stop to the Overlord&hellip; Or something like that, what does this mean for the sets? The more mystical and fantastical builds are giving way to technological nightmares of despair, and that is all we&rsquo;ll say on the subject.</p>

<p>Is this a good set to pick up? Read on and discover the facts.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>This season is all about Zane and the box design reflects this. It&rsquo;s become white with a diagram in the background of Zane who is the template for the Nindroid enemies. Showing off this set is the action shot of Lloyd going after OverBorg on his giant mechanical tread-bike of doom, all while showing an image of the great Ninjago city in the background. The back shows off the two play features of the set, and that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>The instructions of Ninjago from this year look like a blueprint on the cover with the simple blue background and the image of the set from the front of the box. Breaking up the build by the two numbered bags included in the set they are easy to follow and don&rsquo;t involve too many tricky steps. While 2013 had very minimal presentation, 2014 brought in cross-promotional images for the entire wave and for the first time introduced a minifgure checklist. Awesome!</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>There are some nice pieces in purple and green in this set, and the rest are mostly black and grey. Nothing really stands out as unique, except of course the green garbage can, it&rsquo;s rare to find this item in this colour and to have one in this set is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Back to basics here as there are only 2 minifigures in this set, which is a shame as it would be nice to get more Nindroids to fight.</p>

<p>Lloyd ReBooted: The Green Ninja is back, Lloyd Garmadon is dressed in an interesting outfit this time, with shades of his past abilities. LEGO has done away with leg printing in this wave, which I think is a real shame because it makes the ninja less detailed. They&rsquo;ve also done away with the full mask coverings and introduced hair pieces with mouth covering bandanas. (A part introduced in the CMF line.) Here it&rsquo;s a green in colour and you get a spare with each ninja in case you lose it, or to MOC yourself some new ninja to join the team.</p>

<p>He includes a gold armour similar to his last appearance as the Gold Ninja and now you get three katanas, two you can fit in his back and a spare to put in his hand.</p>

<p>Cyrus Borg AKA the OverBorg: I don&rsquo;t know the backstory on this character because I haven&rsquo;t seen the new season yet, however I do know this minifigure is cool. The box totes him as a three-in-one minifigure, which is technically true. But we&rsquo;ll discuss that more later in the review, the main minifigure has a double-sided torso print, no leg printing and a brand new hairpiece sculpt that turns an ordinary minifigure into a half cyborg, half human character.</p>

<p>He has no accessories in this regular form, but when you attach him to the six legged mechanical chair of doom you get two extra arms with a silver katana and a strange red axe/saw weapon of some sort. He has a double-sided face as well, one side is cybernetic the other is normal. They didn&rsquo;t include an alternate hair piece for him though so he still has the cyber eye scanner thing on the side of his head.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Each vehicle is a simple build, the larger tread-bike of doom involves a lot more building of course. There&rsquo;s no control section in the main build because OverBorg attaches with his command chair and that&rsquo;s how you drive the bike.</p>

<p>The build includes placing stickers instead of printed details, which is a bit disappointing and may lead to younger builds requiring some help during the build to get them to fit properly. The first bag is Lloyd&rsquo;s bike, a small ramp the garbage can and Cyrus Borg. The second bag is where you build the tread-bike. There are some technic elements of these builds, which some may not enjoy, however LEGO Ninjago has included this style of vehicle build since the beginning.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Lloyd&rsquo;s bike and the small ramp build are pretty minimal, I think they were just added to the set to bulk up the piece count because the bike isn&rsquo;t that big. The ramp is meant for Lloyd to fly up on his bike, it also has a little fire hydrant on the corner&hellip; a rather imagination fuelled play feature that isn&rsquo;t worth it honestly because the ramp isn&rsquo;t attached to anything so trying to roll the bike up it causes the ramp to move out from under the tires.</p>

<p>The tread-bike that OverBorg uses is kind of interesting, the build sits mostly up on this giant tread and has sharp blades coming out of every corner, even the saw blades are a deadly weapon. The play feature unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t want to work very well, the two saws are on rotating wheels and are meant to rotate as you roll the bike along on it&rsquo;s tread&hellip; This doesn&rsquo;t go too well, the arms they&rsquo;re attached to tend to flop about and the wheels don&rsquo;t catch on hard surfaces very well.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a nice solid looking vehicle though, despite being meant as part of CyrusBorg&rsquo;s full minifigure form, since his command chair thing is the control section for the bike.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say you couldn&rsquo;t pass this up if you wanted the characters in it. The builds are not the most impressive from this wave and the play features are rather bland since they don&rsquo;t work as advertised. Still it is a cheap way to get Lloyd this year, and that green garbage can is a great little addition. Lloyd&rsquo;s bike is nice too, I&rsquo;d say a bit better thought out than the main build because it&rsquo;s a fully functional little bike. So recommended, though if I could get only one set from this wave I think the Nindroid Dragon would be the one to nab for sure.</p>

"Stubborn_Virus","2014-01-13T00:16:24.51Z","Clever Design with some fatal flaws","As a MOC builder with a penchant for Mechs, I was a bit surprised how much I wanted to buy this set when I first saw it. I had recently drawn up a design for a mech based around a center tread, similar to the OverBorg tank's design, and decided to get the set for both the parts, as well as the novelty of having a cyberpunk ninja.&nbsp;<div><br><div>The build of the ninja's bike is nothing much, but it does come with some nice detailing in the form of gold bits. Unfortunately, stickers are used where personally I think 1x2 slanted grates would fit better, but that's the choice of the designers. The Tank is the main point of the build, anyways.&nbsp;</div><div>The tank is built around the central tread, which, instead of useing technic wheels as usual, uses gears to hold the tread in place. The tread goes through part of the body, which means that it occasionally can get caught on studs inside the main body if you're too rough with it, causing it to stutter and jump unpredictably while rolling it around. Two saw blades are attached to the sides, and are attached to two small wheels, causing them to rotate while riding, however they have a penchant for twisting while rolling the tank, causing them to dislodge and not rotate properly. Cyrus Borg sits in a small spider chair, which attaches to the main tank by a very weak connection, resulting in him easily fallling off. (Perhaps that's intentional? Am I supposed to drive the ninja up the included slope and ram him off?) The tank is covered in blades, giving it an aura of mencace, but the front set can rotate, and sometimes will sink to the bottom and essentially bring the tank to an unexpected halt if on carpet. Also, stickers. While the stickers on the side aren't too bad, the ones on the front and back will clash with almost anything else if you use the parts they're on, due to being purple.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The design is quite nice, however, the tank has many flaws that make playability unpredictable. 4/5</div></div>",TRUE,4,4,4,3,4
