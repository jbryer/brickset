"Wall_e2624","2014-01-10T08:55:30.6Z","A worthy addition to Ninjago's comeback wave.","<p>Ninjago was set to end last year but, being one of LEGO&#39;s most popular themes, the fans wouldn&#39;t let that happen. So now we have the new line called &#39;Rebooted&#39; and, when pictures first emerged, this was the set that caught my eye. Enough chit-chat, on to the review. (By the way, this is one of my first reviews ever so apologies for low quality)</p>

<p><span style=""font-family:arvo-fs,rockwell,courier,sans-serif; font-size:20px; letter-spacing:-0.75px"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The front of the box shows an action sequence with the NinjaCopter&nbsp;aimlessly firing missiles at the flying Nindroids. It highlights Zane and Pixal in the bottom right corner. The top shows the minifigures&nbsp;included in this set, of which there are four. Interestingly, the Nindroid warrior is labeled as General Cryptor. A minor issue I jus thought to point out. The back shows the play features and the checklist of each Techno Blade&nbsp;(or &#39;parent&#39;s nightmare&#39; as I like to call it), this one being the second one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions consist of one 79 page booklet. The front cover is excellent, instead of directly mimicking&nbsp;the front of the box like sets have been for many years, it shows the model on a blueprint background. It is a wonderful design and I hope other themes do something like this.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Unless you like white, there isn&#39;t a lot to right home about. There are some nice purple pieces, most notably the purple grill piece which only appears in four other sets. Another interesting piece is the new A-frame pieces we have been drooling over for a while. This set comes with two of them. I am not saying there aren&#39;t any interesting parts that are white. There are some very rare and useful white elements.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with four minifigures, two of which are exclusive to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Zane: This variation of the robotic ninja of ice is a battle scarred variation, with his torso ripped open and half his face exposed. It is weird that this variation is included in the main wave when a normal version is included in a limited edition set. Anyway, the printing is excellent. There is immaculate detailing in the robotic parts. I did find it strange that his insides are different in comparison to the T.V show. I am a fan of the half mask that covers his mouth and his parts will be very useful in custom cyborg figures. I am a little disappointed at his legs not being printed, but the top half of him is amazingly detailed so I am not complaining.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pixal: I was very confused as to who this character is, but now that I know who she is, she is a welcome addition to my collection. I love the printing of the purple wiring (or whatever it is) on her body. It is unfortunate that her legs aren&#39;t printed either. Her face is double sided with one head showing a calm face with green eyes and the other showing an angry face with red eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nindroid Drone: This minifigure&nbsp;is the maskless variation of the Nindroid&nbsp;warriors. He also does not have leg printing but he does have excellent face and torso printing. He has a purple and black sash that is printed on both sides of the torso. He also has a neck bracket which has a technic pin on the back, the purpose for that will become evident later on. Not the best figure in the set but a nice looking figure all the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nindroid Warrior: This one looks a bit more exciting than the Drone. His mask is the same as the ZX suits from a couple of years back but with a cybernetic&nbsp;eye-thingy on the side. His face print is the same as the Drone. His torso represents a gi that has opened up and is exposing his insides and one of his arms. He is the only figure in this set to have leg printing. It is very nice and blends well with the bottom of the torso print. Overall he is a very nice looking figure that looks like a formidable opponent for the ninja to fight.</p>

<p>In terms of accessories, Zane has his techno blade and a perch for his falcon. Even though his falcon is the same mold&nbsp;as Tonto&#39;s bird, it is lovely to have the falcon in physical form. Pixal&nbsp;has a silver blade and the Nindroid Warrior has an double edged axe.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build had a few interesting moments like how the transform feature was built. But otherwise not too many interesting techniques were used.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is marvelous. It really does look like something the Galaxy&nbsp;Squad would use, maybe it was a scrapped concept? The Nindroids also get a little plane to go up against Zane. The plane&#39;s design is not bad. Obviously, being a filler model, it isn&#39;t the standout of the set but it isn&#39;t a bad little model that is very swooshable. It can carry both of the Nindroids&nbsp;in the seat. The back of the plane snaps off to become a glider for the Drone, hence the neck bracket. The glider is pretty bulky but it does the job. It also makes good use of the new A-frame pieces. But now onto the reason I bought this set. The NinjaCopter&nbsp;is a wonderful albeit very crazy looking model. The colour scheme mainly consists of white and blue, appropriate colours for the ninja of ice. The set is also rich in play features. The biggest of them is the transform feature. Turn the gold piece holding the rotor and it will convert from landing mode to speed mode or it turns the thrusters around automatically. A very well done feature but sometimes doesn&#39;t work too well. The cockpit is very spacious and can fit both minifigures&nbsp;while they are holding their accessories and can even fit one more minifigure&nbsp;in the back.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I do not regret picking this set up. The minifigures are excellent and the model is very well designed. It is definitely one of my&nbsp;favourite Ninjago&nbsp;sets of all time. It may not interest those who are not fans of Ninjago, but fans will love this set and I highly recommend it.&nbsp;</p>
