"aranobilis96","2014-01-23T17:05:29.587Z","ROAR!","<p>I picked this set up recently and decided to review it today. This is the largest Ninjago set of the first half of 2014 and the 7th (and best) Ninjago dragon.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The box is pretty big. It has Zane`s face next to the Ninjago logo. On the back, it shows the play features displayed in a blueprint format. Throughout the sides of the box, there are many sketches of various Ninjago objects such as a techno blade, Pixal`s torso and General Cryptor`s armor piece - which I found interesting. There are 2 instruction books- 1 for the car and the other for the dragon which are presented on the cover in a blueprint style.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There were a big variety of parts- mainly in black and purple. I guess this set&nbsp;would make a good purple parts pack. This set also has a good amount of new parts- most notable the new ""A"" plates (8 of them) and 4 Hero Factory feet that hold the dragon`s toes.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There are 5 minifigures in this set. Lloyd&nbsp;who also&nbsp;appears in the 70722&nbsp;Overborg Attack, General Cryptor and a Nindroid. However the main stars of this set are the exclusive Sensei Garmadon and Evil&nbsp;Wu. Sensei Garmadon has nice leg and torso printing along with a new recolored Anakin`s&nbsp;hairpiece in grey. Evil Wu is also an excellent fig and featured a recolored beard and hat. I don't know how Wu turns evil and will most likely be revealed in the show.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was surprisingly interesting. The minifigures were divided by bags.&nbsp;There were many features I never knew about until I was building them- such as the hidden flick missiles on the car and spinning sawblades on the dragon.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>The completed model</strong></p><p>Both models&nbsp;are fantastic, sturdy and swooshable. The stickers really do enhance the set- especially on the dragon`s head and I would recommend putting them on. </p><p>Nya`s Car (It says it in the set description and you can also tell its Nya`s because of the phoenix symbol on the flag)&nbsp;has&nbsp;a&nbsp;very nice&nbsp;design with&nbsp;white accents. It has a seats for both Lloyd and Garmadon. I don't like how there is no place to store Garmadon`s staff once he is in the cockpit. The main feature of the car is the hidden flick missiles.&nbsp;They can be launched by pressing the afterburners on the back. It takes some practice to master and sometimes shoots backwards or straight up. NPU for using the katanas as the front bumper.</p><p>The main&nbsp;attraction and namesake of this set&nbsp;is the Mechdragon. It looks absolutely stunning and is roughly the same size as the Four-headed Ultra Dragon from the 9450 Epic Dragon Battle. It has a very robotic look and has a consistent color scheme of&nbsp;black, purple, trans-red and grey. It is also jam-packed with play features. It has a prison to put Lloyd in, a Technic shooter, swinging tail and 2 gliders that can be detached from the body and be put on the nindroid. The dragon can also stand on it`s hind legs and featured 2 spinning saw blades- which are my favorite part of the design. The sawblades spin by moving a smaller gear against the larger one with is then pulled back by the rubber band -a genius function!&nbsp;The only problem with&nbsp; the dragon is that it should have movable wings.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall this set is amazing and not only does it have excellent minifigs, but also 2 sturdy and well designed models. However,&nbsp;I wish the price was at least 10 USD cheaper or had an extra minifig (maybe another nindroid because the dragon has 2 gliders) because many&nbsp;similar (cheaper)&nbsp;priced Ninjago sets from previous years had 6 minifigs such as the 9449 Ultra Sonic Raider, 9446 Destiny`s Bounty and 2505 Garmadon`s Dark Fortress. This the best 2014&nbsp;Ninjago set of the first half and I would recommend it to anyone.(Although you should get it on sale)</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,3
"sulkera","2014-06-06T19:25:56.41Z","beware the mechdragon!","<p>Box/Instructions- This set comes with 2 instruction&nbsp;manuels. The first one for&nbsp;garmadon&#39;s/nya&#39;s&nbsp;car and the&nbsp;2nd&nbsp;for the&nbsp;mechdragon&nbsp;itself.</p>

<p>Parts- the set comes with many purple and gray parts, a good combo on the&nbsp;mechdragon. It also comes with 2 cool blades.</p>

<p>Minifigures- The set comes with 5 figs- general&nbsp;cryptor, a&nbsp;nindroid, evil&nbsp;wu,&nbsp;garmadon&nbsp;and lloyd.Both&nbsp;wu&nbsp;and&nbsp;garmadon&nbsp;are exclusive to this set. My favorite figs are&nbsp;wu&nbsp;and sensei&nbsp;garmadon. They are both very cool, well detailed figs.</p>

<p>The build- the build took me a very short time actually, shorter than I thought. Each bag had not many pieces. Each bag built a certain body part of the dragon one by one, for ex. one bag built the wings, and another built the limbs. I like how the figs were distributed throughout the bags rather than putting them all in one bag.</p>

<p>The completed model- the set completed was excellent! Features- hidden jail;spinning saw blades;detachable gliders(2 gliders); giant missile cannon; whipping tail. The car was a small but cool build. It include two side missiles and a flick missile.</p>

<p>Overall opinion - Overall this set is a great addition to the 2014 theme and a must have for a&nbsp;ninjago&nbsp;collector/fan. My rating- 8 out of 10. It is a&nbsp;litte&nbsp;pricey which is why the rating is not a 9 or 8.5</p>

"Darth_Brickious","2015-01-10T08:20:36.887Z","Review 70725-1: Nindroid MechDragon","<p><strong>Intro</strong><br />
I have had my eye on 70725 for a while as I own most of the other Ninjago dragons but I was never sure about the brick built head. When I saw it was I discounted by 30% at Farmers in Lower Hutt NZ today the time had come to just grab it.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
Box is deceptive as whilst the artwork lives up to Legos usual high standard the main model is not posed in the most attractive view.<br />
Instructions are spot on, no errors and follow a logical building flow &amp; I only managed to miss one brick placement through the whole build.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
There is a good selection of parts with some useful purple bricks. The only part I had not come across before was the technic connector attaching the tail to the main body. Not sure if this was a new part as I don&#39;t usually buy technics sets but it definitely caused a &quot;oh cool&quot; moment.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
A great selection of minifigs, I really like the Nindroids so I was pleased to be adding two more to my rapidly expanding army. All the figs have excellent printing and seem to be a well chosen mix of characters. For once no outrageous brick build weapons, just good ol&#39; fashioned samurai swords.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong><br />
The build was fun but straight forward. There was some nice techniques used especially how the wings connect to the main body using various technics parts and pins, just a shame the wings do not move.The use of headlight bricks and cheese wedges to create the toes was especially clever. I also liked how the spine sloped down to the rear using Technics lift arms however this does make the rear of the body fragile and prone to shedding parts if not handled carefully. This could probably be addressed with some more connections and a little bit of MOCing.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong><br />
The completed set looks good and presents plenty of play scenarios. Nya&rsquo;s car looks reasonable enough although I think the choice of white highlights was not the best, blue would have sold it better. At least this vehicle is not just fluff as is so often the case with supporting vehicles e.g. Stealthor&rsquo;s detachable trike in 70143.<br />
I do wish Lego had chosen to include a molded dragons head like previous Ninjago dragons. Whilst the design of the brick built head is good enough it just doesn&#39;t have the same impact as the molded version especially when displayed next to other Ninjago dragons like <span>2521: </span> Lightning Dragon Battle.<br />
I was also really disappointed Lego chose to omit movable wings in favour of the large cutting blades. Whilst the blades do add a great play feature the static wings ruin the posability of the dragon. The dragon is shown in the instructions standing upright on its hind legs and to pull this pose of the wings really need to be moved. Sooo I couldn&#39;t help myself and on completing the build I immediately rebuilt the dragon to allow the wings to be moved and posed and also do away with the silly looking cutting blades. I also changed the top of the spine by adding curved slopes, jumper plates and spikes which IMO really improved the look of the dragon. It now sits rather nicely in amongst my display of Ninjago dragons.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
<a href=""http://brickset.com/profile/aranobilis96"">aranobilis96</a> commented in his review that this is the best Ninjago dragon so far, I don&#39;t agree, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/2521-1/Lightning-Dragon-Battle""><span>2521: </span> Lightning Dragon Battle</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9450-1/Epic-Dragon-Battle""><span>9450: </span> Epic Dragon Battle</a> are stunning looking and are the main reason I keep Ninjago dragons built and on display. However with the modifications I made to the wings 70725-1: Nindroid MechDragon is now not to far behind 2521 &amp; 9450 in terms of purely awesome looks!</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong><br />
If you can get this set on sale I do recommend it. Kids may need some help making some of the Technics connections but their efforts will be rewarded with a set that has lots of play possibilities as well as a good looking dragon. AFOLS might be disappointed with the relative lack of unique parts but every brick in this set will be welcome edition&#39;s to the parts collection. However if you do get this set I highly recommend looking at ways of MOCing the dragon wings so they can be posed as it really does complete the model!</p>

"coyboy1","2015-12-25T11:02:27.683Z","My daughter loves this one!","<p>Hi. This is my first review, and of all the current Lego products I own, I found this one to be easier to review. I purchased this set online at a slightly cheaper price than MSRP. As a parent, the price looks a bit scary, but this set has a lot of playability and comes with a lot of bells and whistles.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions were fairly easy to understand. The car is obviously the easier build, and once you get deeper into the instructions of the dragon, you feel pretty surprised how so many steps lead to such a detailed toy. You almost forget what pieces you&#39;ve put in place to build such a massive frame. The box design is very nice and does a really decent job in selling you on why you would want this in your collection.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of awesome parts here. The spinning blades were definitely the show stealer, once assembled. As a person who grew up with the older sets, it&#39;s very intriguing to work with rubber-bands on a Lego set. Also, the Ninjago line has made a staple of having a missile cannon on most sets including this one.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>5 Minifigs in total. After having a few Ninjago sets under my belt, I&#39;ve found I&#39;m up to my third Lloyd with this one. The Wu is a nice addition to this one as well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Okay, so between the build and completed model I do have some pros and cons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car is solid. It holds up well after being built. The dragon, not so much. The dragon was time consuming but not too horribly. I did like the hidden jail cell in the center of the dragon&#39;s torso. Some Ninjago collectors did not like the dragon head. I personally like the design of the head. Since this dragon is more of a mech design, it adds to the mech feel. Sort of reminds me of some of the mech themed toys from the 80&#39;s. I also really liked the pivoted tail that can sway side to side as an additional attack, one of many attack items on this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model, as stated above, is nice but the dragon is a bit tricky to handle and play with. For one, the gliders mounted to the inner sides of the dragon tend to pop off way too easily. Also, other random parts will come off the dragon if you&#39;re not too careful handling it. I found the wings to be a bit bulky so the whole wing assembly on either side may just randomly pop off during play. Once this happens, you have to remember the alignment of some angled pieces that have to be locked into place then fight a little bit with the rubber-band system in order to get things back together again. The individual wing blades pop off fairly easy as well. As an AFOL, it tends to blow the wind out of your sails having to reassemble something so many times, but it&#39;s also understanding that this is made with easy to construct interlocking pieces, so it comes with the territory. From my young daughters&#39; standpoint, she would get easily frustrated with the random parts falling off and lost interest if it was too much of a fight to get back together, so parents buying this for a kid, make a note of that.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall. This is a really nice set. This set does fit the detail of the dragon depicted from the Ninjago animated series very well. It&#39;s big and dwarves the previous dragons from the series. It definitely is intimidating, and KFOL&#39;s/AFOL&#39;s will both have fun with this set. My daughter loves the dragon way more than the vehicle. She spent over an hour using the missile canon to shoot random minifigs while her and I made a game out of how far the cannon can hit a target from fay away. Get this set when you can find it at a good price!</p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-08-26T06:34:05.31Z","Looks great, limited articulation","<p>This is one of the larger sets in the 3rd season of Ninjago, &lsquo;Rebooted&rsquo;. &lsquo;Rebooted&rsquo; introduces one of my favourite Ninjago villains, the Nindroids. This set features a robotic dragon which looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sensei Garmadon: This season brings about a big change, Garmadon has turned good! This figure looks fantastic with messy grey hair and a single stern expression. He has light grey robes with gold symbols and green trim. The print continues to the legs with a green belt and he carries a brown staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lloyd: The other main character in this set is Lloyd, which is fitting as he is Garmadon&#39;s son. Each of the Ninja in this wave have a bandanna and hair piece rather than a full hood, which is a cool change from previous waves. Lloyd has the same messy hair as his dad but this time in tan, and he has a serious expression. His robes and bandanna are appropriately green. The torso has a great print with gold texture and symbols on it. Unfortunately, his legs are unprinted. He wields a gold katana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Evil Wu: To complement Garmadon, Wu has been implanted with cybernetics and turned evil. Rather than his normal white and tan colour scheme, he now wears black, white, silver, and purple. He features his traditional hat but in silver and the cybernetics have been implanted into his head. His eyes are red and he&#39;s got a black beard. I like the white shirt with black trim as it has a nice contrast to his black legs which are sadly unprinted. The torso also has cybernetic implants in it to good effect. He carries a black staff.</p>

<p>General Cryptor: I absolutely love the design of the Nindroids which is why this wave of Ninjago &lsquo;Rebooted&rsquo; is one of my favourites. The Nindroid&rsquo;s hoods are fantastic. They resemble the Ninja&rsquo;s hoods from the &ldquo;Rise of the Snakes&rdquo; season but with a cybernetic eye mould and print. Under the hood, Cryptor has black skin with red eyes and the same cybernetic eye implant that is seen on his hood. He is grimacing and has exposed metal over the lower half of his face. His shoulder armour piece is another great element which can store two katanas. The torso has black robes with purple trim over a robotic chest. The legs continue the purple trim and have a tear, exposing metal. He carries two silver katanas and a &ldquo;built up&rdquo; axe with a transparent red blade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nindroid: The last figure in the set is an unnamed Nindroid. He has the same fantastic hood piece as General Cryptor but doesn&rsquo;t have any shoulder armour. He has a different expression with a lopsided grimace and metal cybernetics over half his face. Instead of armour he has a clip on the back of his torso. The chest piece is similar to Cryptors but has more exposed metal and he has the same legs. He also wields an axe.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The Sidebuild&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The set includes a vehicle for the main characters which looks cool. This vehicle has a striking colour scheme of white and gold, in contrast to the black, silver and purple dragon. It has four gold wheels with black rubber tires that spin freely. I like the bumper on the front of the car which uses gold katanas for detail and has white headlights. The canopy opens and can fit a single reclining figure. The car has a fantastic action feature. The engines can be pressed lightly to raise missile launchers on either side of the cockpit, when pressed all the way they shoot flick-fire missiles. A turret on the back of the model can fit a second figure. The turret rotates 360 degrees on a ratcheted turntable which holds its position when angled. It has two large, &ldquo;built up&rdquo; guns that can&rsquo;t be fired but look nice, as well as another flick-fire missile with a harpoon on it. The turret can also be angled back and a gold stickered flag adorns the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This dragon has a huge wingspan and great colour scheme that makes for a very imposing model. Due to its size, it&#39;s not very swooshable but it has some great action features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dragon is larger and heavier than average so the articulation is more limited. The head is an exception. It&#39;s attached with two ball joints which allows it to touch the ground, look in the air, and cock its head inquisitively. The front legs are quite stubby so even though they have two points of articulation, it doesn&rsquo;t allow for that many postures. The back legs only have a single joint but it can rear up on its hind legs which looks fantastic. The wings are completely static which is unfortunate as wing articulation often looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head looks ok. It&rsquo;s blocky and under-detailed although it does have red eyes, a mouth that opens and a few sticker details. The body is very angular with a lot of cool features. Two panels at the front can open and have clips to store the Nindroid&rsquo;s axes. A section near the seat is removable and works as a prison for a single figure. A technic cannon is mounted on the top of the dragon and can be fired off easily: although I like the weapon, I wish it was better integrated. There is space for a few figures inside the dragon which can be accessed by removing two panels. These panels are great as they double as gliders which can attach to the Nindroid with the clip. I don&rsquo;t like the tail. It is made up of sections that can articulate independently and a gear can be turned to move the tail. While this makes for a cool action feature it means you can&rsquo;t pose the tail because it reverts to a neutral position after use. The wings are huge and look very imposing and feature spinning saw blades that move when they are pushed in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of the larger Lego dragons and suffers from limited articulation. The head design also leaves much to be desired. On the other hand it&#39;s huge and imposing with a great colour scheme and good action features. The side build is good. The figures are amazing although two of them lack a leg print. $120 aud is good for a set this size and I recommend this set.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Evil sensei wu. Great except for no leg printing. same thing for Lloyd here. i love sensei garmadon however.</p>

<p>For parts we have some wings, wheels and a technic cannon. some solid stuff here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>putting this set together was good. some technic stuff however which i do not like.</p>

<p>For models we have the robot dragon itself and nya&#39;s little car.</p>

<p>The car looks pretty good with a turret at the back which is pretty cool. Flick missiles on the side. the idea is excellent, but does not work great and leaves the sides looking exposed. flag is very easy to knock off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dragon itself looks awesome with the wings and sawblades, and a cannon. lacks articulation with only being able to pose the head and some of the front legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not very sturdy. Multiple times when swooshing it around the tail and wings fall off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It does have some good functions however. detachable gliders, spinning blades, shooting cannon and a prison.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So overall the set has great figures. a great looking main build. but lacks sturdiness. and that&#39;s a big issue i think.</p>

<p>For PPP, WOW This set is kinda expensive in the us. in Europe it&#39;s decent but in the us? NO.</p>
