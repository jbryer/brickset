Pas de probl&egrave;me pour la construction, sauf pour les murs incurv&eacute;s o&ugrave; j&#39;ai du l&#39;aider. L&#39;&acirc;ge minimum pr&eacute;conis&eacute; par la bo&icirc;te est donc correct.</p>

<p>La construction est d&#39;ailleurs tr&egrave;s rapide car ce set est plut&ocirc;t ax&eacute; sur la jouabilit&eacute;. Un pan de mur avec une porte dont la cl&eacute; est cach&eacute;e, une cible, un arbre pour accroch&eacute; l&#39;arc, une mini cascade avec un feu de camp et la catapulte des petits fr&egrave;res. Tous ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments permettent de recr&eacute;er des sc&egrave;nes du film mais n&#39;offrent donc pas une grande exp&eacute;rience de construction.</p>

<p>Comme toujours dans cette gamme, peu de personnage... Ici, nous n&#39;avons que Merida et trois petits ours (ses fr&egrave;res, transform&eacute;s). N&eacute;anmoins, le prix reste plut&ocirc;t abordable compte tenu de l&#39;exp&eacute;rience de jeu.</p>

<p>She&#39;ll be happy with the Merida&nbsp;minidoll and three bear brothers&nbsp;but the rest of the parts are a generic batch with no evocation of the film.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Does nothing to evoke the film, it could have had a couple of standing stones, a big mummy bear type mixel, the castle feasting hall features prominently but we get just a door and small wall. &nbsp;The food&nbsp;is poorly done with just a roasting fish, could have been much more.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Merida may not have scaled the heights of Frozen or Tangled but that was no excuse for what is an uninspiring set. &nbsp;Could have been much much more.&nbsp;</p>

And it&rsquo;s nice to see them go with some of the more recent princesses instead of just the classics. I&rsquo;m still waiting for Snow White and Belle, but I&rsquo;m sure the 2016 offerings from this Theme will include them. Now to discuss the awesome that is this set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: Again there is something really eye-catching about the Disney Princess box designs. And it isn&rsquo;t just the colours chosen. These things really stand out, and each box has a unique bit of artwork of the princess in question in the lower right corner. The drawing of Merida here almost looks like a CGI shot straight out of Brave, on closer inspection though you&rsquo;ll find it isn&rsquo;t.</span></span></span></span></p>

It will appeal to the younger audience for the sets as well.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: LEGO broke up the model into two numbered bags, and for some strange reason chose to break the builds up into two numbered instruction manuals. This is just a waste of paper, seriously the first manual is so thin with only 27 pages there was very little point to it. On top of that the second manual is folded in half because it&rsquo;s so large. Personally I would have preferred to see a single manual without the folding in half.</span></span></span></span></p>

You also get a nice pearl gold bow. Overall I do think it&rsquo;s decent enough as a parts pack if you want certain types of pieces, but there are probably better ones out there in the Friends and Princess Themes.</span></span></span></span></p>

I am annoyed that instead of making a new hair piece like they did with many of the princesses they just gave us Andrea&rsquo;s hair in red. It isn&rsquo;t a good enough match for the characters messy hair from the film.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Accessories include a pair of keys, a gold bow, a chicken leg and a fish for frying. The set also includes three brand new sculpted bear cub animal pieces, to represent her three brothers after they&rsquo;ve been transformed. Yep, that&rsquo;s pretty much what I&rsquo;d expect in a set like this.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: This build includes a small tree, campfire with fish and miniature waterfall, catapult with confectionary missiles and Merida plus an archery competition target. Overall not much to say about this build, there are no difficult steps for the models in this bag and aside from the tree nothing requires a large number of pieces, with possible exception to the camp site mini-model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: This build is much more detailed and involved with you building a small castle, there are a few large pieces used instead of brick building, and instead of printed details it&rsquo;s all stickers. Not much else to say about the build here, except you also have two little buildable wisps.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

Honestly I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed in how they chose to set up this set, considering all of the impressive set pieces in the film and how the castle ruins were handled I might have preferred to see something a bit more involved for this build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The small castle build is just terrible, it&rsquo;s meant to be an open area with eating hall, and you also have a small sticker representing the tapestry Merida&rsquo;s mother made. And I do mean small. It would have been better to include the tapestry as an actual cloth piece, and perhaps include something to attach it to, at least then you could see the image better than the sticker shows it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I will admit though that while the models of this set are somewhat disappointing from a standpoint of accuracy to events in the film, or rather looking like something actually in the film, it does have a load of playability. You can launch cookies, have Merida practice archery lessons with her bow, and enjoy a good meal of leg of chicken with her brothers. Who are bears&hellip; They&rsquo;ll probably prefer the fish roasting on the spit near the mini-waterfall.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""line-height: 107%;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Overall, I&rsquo;d have to say LEGO could have done a lot better for a Brave themed set. Why not include the mother? I get why we wouldn&rsquo;t have the father or her brothers in human form, but the mother, before she was turned into a bear, is a very integral part to the plot and it would have been nice to get her in mini-doll form. I can only mildly recommend this set, it&rsquo;s got a decent presentation and some nice parts, and Merida is almost perfect. Unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t the ideal set for this film, here&rsquo;s hoping they make a slightly larger set and include a better hairpiece for Merida and her mother.</span></span></span></span></p>
