"Sebastian","2014-05-12T19:55:59.61Z","Peaceful and charming scene","<p>This is the first 2014 set that I bought and also one of the few girly themed sets I have ever added to my collection.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed about the new Disney Princess sets when I discovered them in the department store were the boxes whose upper top left and right edges were lowered. I do not &nbsp;know for what reason this has come about; maybe the design department found the boxes to be more appealing this way and more likely to be &quot;grabbed&quot; off the shelf. My major gripe with this is clearly the pricing.&nbsp;All in all, you get a rather small set for 30,00 euros.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set comes&nbsp;with many unusual parts that are somewhat uncommon to be found all in one single set. The most noteworthy here are probably the croissant, the three oars (one is a spare), a frog, two goblets, a light blue blossom piece, three of&nbsp;the new fir pieces, transparent minifig heads, the big gazebo elements&nbsp;and a dark violet basket/bag. There are also many small parts used for detailing.&nbsp;Colourwise, obviously the bright&nbsp;hues prevail but there are some embedded particles of darker colours for contrasting which I liked a lot.</p>

<p>The layout components are&nbsp;nicely rearrangeable but I find there&nbsp;is at least one mini build too many as a couple more parts should have gone into the main &quot;castle&quot; which&nbsp;looks more like a&nbsp;<em>maison&nbsp;de plaisance</em>. However, the rather small but surprisingly heavy main portion includes some nice features like the telescope on the rooftop terrace, two vases and golden wine goblets. The upper part of the inside could have been a bit more substantial as one just looks at the hollow cylindric tower piece.</p>

<p>The jetty is nicely done and was one of the incentives why I bought this set. Sometimes it&#39;s just the small details that make me like a model. It also makes use of the old ladder piece in a darker (?)&nbsp;shade of yellow. The other micro build is a good attempt at a weeping willow given the small scale.</p>

<p>Honestly, I do not really know to whom I should recommend this set apart from girls.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;there is not&nbsp;much display value in it in terms of positioning of the minifigures as they are&nbsp;Friends dolls. I&nbsp;&nbsp;think there are people out there who enjoy&nbsp;certain sets due to their charm and coziness so this should be for you.</p>

"Cheshire_axolotl","2014-07-21T16:06:35.927Z","Mixed Bag...","<p>This certainly wasn&rsquo;t on my &lsquo;life-or-death&rsquo; NEED Lego list. I decided my collection didn&#39;t require it to be &#39;awesome&#39;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d rushed out for 41050: Ariel&#39;s Amazing Treasures and 41051: Merida&#39;s Highland Games on release as I&rsquo;m a real sucker for adorable Lego Animals (And what, I ask, would any self-respecting MOC zoo be without Flounder and those heart-achingly cute bear triplets?). However, I had mixed feelings about the sets overall, especially having paid full retail, and thus my interest in the theme disappeared off to a dusty cobwebbed recess to cry&hellip; And yes, specifically I&rsquo;m looking at you, Merida&rsquo;s half-hearted excuse for a &lsquo;castle&rsquo;.</p>

<p>This said, I did keep having a sneaky look at 41052: Ariel&rsquo;s Magical Kiss. She&rsquo;s dressed incorrectly for the &lsquo;kiss&rsquo; scene which irks my inner Disney-geek, in that hair and outfit someone needs to give that girl a fork to brush her hair with; there are no charming animals to burst into song, not even a basic red crab as a Sebastian stand-in; someone has come along and beaten the set with a pink sledgehammer&hellip; Apparently quite a few times&hellip; &nbsp;So, no, I was definitely NOT going to get it&hellip;</p>

<p>So, one extraordinarily bad day and a 28% discount later, I&rsquo;d bought this home with me and settled down for a build&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>Feels like a good deal</strong></p>

<p>Firstly, I must confess, I was surprised with the volume of Lego in the box. My eyes had made a judgement call from the product photos and pretty box-art, but my hands felt it seemed more substantial than I&rsquo;d previously gauged. It isn&rsquo;t often I feel that way, and nothing quite compares to that warm glow of &lsquo;yes, this actually WAS a bargain!&rsquo; to improve the build experience. There really are a lot of different and rather appealing segments to the set: the mini-dolls, the rowboat, the floral frog podium, the willow, the jetty and the &lsquo;palace dining room&rsquo; (which, if I&rsquo;m being fair, Ariel IS correctly dressed for!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Mini-Dolls</strong></p>

<p>I have mixed feelings about mini-dolls (doesn&rsquo;t everyone?), having been won over once and then stood utterly corrected (41008: Heartlake City Pool. I&rsquo;d embraced them, then realised those tiny peg waists won&rsquo;t allow for a &lsquo;submerged&rsquo; swimmer. Fail.)</p>

<p>Eric is rather charmingly rendered, attired spot-on for his animated counterpart. Unfortunately my Ariel&rsquo;s torso and skirt are fractionally different shades of pink, which isn&rsquo;t noticeable at a distance but very distinctive at close quarters. The pair look great together, but I do want to source her a fork for the sake of authenticity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Rowboat</strong></p>

<p>Hit with the Sledgehammer of Pink, this was one of the reasons I&rsquo;d turned this set down from my initial Disney rush. &nbsp;I can change the colour of the builds themselves by supplementing parts but this&hellip; I imagine the target fans, young girls, will probably LOVE the pink boat. I&rsquo;m sure as a kid I would have loved loading it up with figures and &lsquo;splashing&rsquo; it about in the air across an imaginary ocean. Combined with one of the &lsquo;Friends&rsquo; dogs, the mermaid Ariel &ndash; admittedly I&rsquo;d imagine with swapped hair &ndash; and potential villains like Chima&rsquo;s Scutter, this would have been my entire summer holiday sorted. Frankly, feeling a big nostalgic, I&rsquo;m genuinely heartbroken this wasn&rsquo;t around 13 years ago!!! &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The floral frog podium</strong></p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s small and basic, almost feels a bit like a throw-away addition, it&rsquo;s the only reference to the singing animals of the &lsquo;magical (non)kiss&rsquo; scene of the film. I still can&rsquo;t quite get over that there isn&rsquo;t a seagull or basic red crab to stand in for Scuttle and Sebastian, but raiding another two frog pieces from elsewhere provides a nice frog chorus. The floral waterlilies make the little piece pop and looks nice when teamed with&nbsp;a blue baseplate as a shallow area to build up with more flower pieces. Again, for the target audience, this little segment is a nice springboard for building up a more diverse pond. Especially as more, and no doubt relevant, animals are released in the Friends line in the future.</p>

<p><strong>The Willow</strong></p>

<p>Teamed up with the frog podium, these two look great together. It&rsquo;s a nice uncomplicated take on a weeping willow using just a handful of pieces, and adds some extra vegetation/wild to the scene. Again, this is a great springboard for the target audience. No complaints here!</p>

<p><strong>The Jetty </strong></p>

<p>The little pier/jetty proved to be my undoing and tipped the &lsquo;buy-it-now&rsquo; scale. It&rsquo;s incredibly sweet, complete with the little ladder down to the water, that bench with overhanging foliage and the &lsquo;overgrown&rsquo; vegetation to the side. To the target audience, and probably a couple of AFOLs like me, this is perfect for playability/potential/constructing entertaining scenes. Promo photos already show it&rsquo;s great for a secret tryst, but there&rsquo;s a lot you can add to and fiddle with. Already in mine the 41023 Fawn has been added to an extended patch of plants; the CMF Swimming Champion, depending on my mood, is either sprinting heroically down the pier to dive in or borrowing the skydiver&rsquo;s face as she uses that ladder to pull herself free of the water &ndash; which is clearly freezing!</p>

<p>Without this, I would never have bothered/thought to build a little fishing jetty, yet I&rsquo;ve fallen head-over-heels (the wood must be slippery?). There&rsquo;s an awful lot you can springboard from with this and I know I&rsquo;m hankering for that CMF Fishing Gnome right now&hellip; And where else would be more perfect for a sailor and mermaid to hold conversation than over that little orange-y ladder?</p>

<p><strong>&lsquo;Palace dining room&rsquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hate it! As much as I loved the Jetty precisely how it was, as soon as I built this I was twitching. This is great for the target audience; it&rsquo;s very pink and has a balcony with a telescope, stickers to add decoration to seat &lsquo;cushions&rsquo; and some ivy up the pristine white curved walls&hellip; Oh, and stickers for a &lsquo;fake&rsquo; window in a useless tower. &nbsp;It isn&rsquo;t just my frustration over things that were wrong (No fork&hellip; Which I *might* have ranted about already&hellip; Secondly, no crabs&hellip; Which I *might* have ranted about in regards to a Sebastian stand-in), but I can&rsquo;t see how the younger me would have engaged with this. It is quite robust though, the balcony shouldn&rsquo;t collapse during play, so the children who do fall in love won&rsquo;t have trouble in that regard.</p>

<p>Some aspects of this are beautiful. Until this week I&rsquo;d never come across the Pavilion piece and now it&rsquo;s turned up twice at once (currently building 8078: Portal of Atlantis). These serve as large open windows, really displaying the transparent minifigure heads - the vases - with flowers&hellip; That I can get behind.</p>

<p>And I have.</p>

<p>With a lot of poking and fiddling, I&rsquo;ve transformed the dining room into two pieces. One has the &lsquo;palace&rsquo; of all the curved stickered walls and faux tower, which is now tucked away in a box so it can only metaphorically gather dust with Merida&rsquo;s castle. The other half has been tampered with, on display, after a full refurbishment... I&rsquo;ve rippled out dining set, made minifig-scale tables/benches and added a strip of neon round 1x1 lights from my loose bricks so Tara the CMF Diner Waitress can serve ice-cream on the table and not her customer&rsquo;s laps. (Originally, there was a beautiful, but very large pale blue&nbsp;&lsquo;flower&rsquo; lampshade &ndash; in real life, as a tall person, I&rsquo;m forever hitting my head on the equivalent of these in pubs/restaurants/department stores/everywhere and they really are rubbish for anything beyond a patchy consistency of light &ndash; so that was never going to stay. I&rsquo;ve got to say though, attached to a green whip, my Poison Ivy fig has never looked happier!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Over-all</strong></p>

<p>This is a set, in essence, of segments. Some sections you can take to the bank, others make you want a refund. The disjointed feel might put some people off, however with a few other bits and pieces (specifically some of the Lego animal packs), this really is something. The target audience, if they&rsquo;re more about the playability/roleplay of a set with only minimal building involved, should be sold on this. It&#39;s going back nigh a decade and a half, but I can see how the child me would have gone ga-ga over the boat, the mini-dolls... Not so much the palace bit, although the balcony is &#39;cool&#39;...</p>

<p>As an AFOL, this is a mixed bag. I&rsquo;ve fallen in love with my bright re-vamped diner, and the jetty is pure perfection. The big&nbsp;flower-piece has a forever home in my Arkham Asylum, Poison Ivy is over the moon. Thus,&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t regret the purchase. &pound;17.99 felt like a good bargain, yet I wouldn&rsquo;t realistically be willing to pay much more having almost passed on it in the first place. It also took me a fair few days, as I was so frightfully unhappy with the palace dining room, to create something I was 100% happy with. In some ways this was a bonus, I don&rsquo;t fiddle with perfection when I see it and that tends to be the end of the build; modifications left me rejigging this 12 minute build on-and-off all week. I <em>really</em> wanted to incorporate that flower/window arrangement into my grand &lsquo;bar/pub/restaurant&rsquo; designs to hodgepodge with 79004 Barrel Escape and, in the future, 75052 Mos Eisley Cantina, so it had to be Lord-Business-esque &lsquo;perfect&rsquo;... &nbsp;Now I&rsquo;ve&nbsp;achieved that, frustratingly, I rather want to pick up a second copy to duplicate a&nbsp;mirrored bright &lsquo;wing&rsquo; to the scene.</p>

<p>And that pink boat, which I once so dreaded, has actually gone on to inspire the beginnings of a large&nbsp;boating pond MOC. Previously I only had black boats in my collection, which was far too stern to team up with the fairground mixer&hellip; Yes, this set is definitely trouble for my display configurations!</p>

<p>It&#39;s the potential, to me, that really makes this set. I&#39;ve contented myself in view of the issues that this is an early set in a theme that, hopefully, will be huge. There are so many (forgive me, but often same-y) Star Wars and City variants, I&#39;ve got my fingers crossed that this takes off and becomes a staple with future sets getting new specific components and greater attention to (authentic) details that Lego is usually so awesome at.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh&hellip; And, when no one is looking? I might just bob the boat about in the air, missing the magic of simpler times.</p>

There&rsquo;s a lot of foliage on the side of the dock as well, which adds a lot of nice detailing. The method for building the dock itself is pretty unique too, compared to similar docks from LEGO Pirates or Ninjago sets with similar docks. You can stand a mini-doll on two of the planks while the others are smooth 1x4 tiles.</span></span></span></span></p>

The use of clear heads for flower vases in each window is very nice too, the gold pastry topping pieces work well for small details on the parapets of the little castle.</span></span></span></span></p>

On a jumper plate you can place a frog so that Ariel has one animal friend trying to encourage her in kissing Eric. A nameless frog is better than nothing I suppose.</span></span></span></span></p>

It also has a lot of great detail work, which is quite common in most LEGO Friends/Disney Princess and Elves sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall would I recommend this set? Yes, I would recommend this quite strongly, a lot of these sets from these Themes are loaded with impressive details and work great as display pieces for fans of Disney and playsets for the younger builders. This set unfortunately has since been retired, so you will need to find it on the secondary market by now. And now on to the next review from LEGO Disney Princess, someone learning about a Whole New World.</span></span></span></span></p>
