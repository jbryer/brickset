Luckily I bought several of these at half price, otherwise I would have bought none at all.  The suits in the set are great, and I liked the special decorated bricks.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-07T13:24:34Z","Hooch","Hooch is a nice fig. The watchtower is great with the little shields. And the costums of Harry and Draco are great. One mistake' they have never made the whole Quidditch teams of Griffindor and slytherin (And Hufflepuff+Ravenclaw). That would be great. And then you've got Fred and George and Cho and that guy that is killed at the end of Book 4.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Irene","2008-03-25T13:36:15.403Z","Nice set. Buy at least two","  I have two complete copies of this set. I then purchased a green base plate and a package of grey bricks and started putting together a Quidditch Field. I used both stands and both sets of hoops and then purchased single players until I had enough players for two teams. I purchased a set of a dozen different hair pieces, and some extra brooms, and set out my two teams. {I use the Quality Quidditch shop as the locker room]. 
  I put a lot of extra pieces (and $) into the field, but now it fits into my whole Hogwarts display. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-09T20:51:21.75Z","Got it half price - otherwise would have passed on it","Set was a little expensive, do really enjoy having Madame Hooch in the mini figure lineup. Colorful bricks,golden snitch(Yea), two brooms, wierd circles but what else could they do. Good set if you don't have to pay full price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legolander","2007-05-10T04:27:10.15Z","Nice, but too expensive...","What I like about this set is that it has the necessary equipments for quidditch; like the quaffle, the bludgers and the golden snitch. I also like the quidditch uniforms as well as the broomsticks. But I think this is a set that is too expensive. There aren't too many pieces and the box is just like that of the Hogwarts Classroom set. Oh well, I can't do anything about that now. I already have this set a long time ago.(about 4 years?)I give it four stars!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BaneShake","2010-02-04T19:55:18.013Z","Quidditch Practice","This set is definitely worth grabbing if you get the chance. I am a brickfilmer, and this set works for great background stuff. However, if you are a collector, here are the pros and cons:
Pros: First Quidditch uniforms made in LEGO
        Exclusive Madam Hooch minifig
        Fun hoop/catapult activity

Cons: Overpriced
          Hoops a little awkward looking ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-03T04:43:24.037Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Quidditch Practice Review","This set is part of the second Harry Potter movie. It's a cool set to have and it has some nice stuff in there. I like the way how LEGO did the 3 goals. They look much better than the ones from the 2010 quidditch set. I also like the design of the grandstand - even if there's only room for one minifig. You get a secret place where you can hide a book if you open the wall with the gryffindor and slytherin logo. The chair seat can also move if you want to hide something.<br><br>This cool set also comes with a treasure chest which has a red ball and two black balls in it and we also get a catapult to shoot them into the air. This set also comes with a shiny golden stud as well which looks like a rare piece. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy have their quidditch uniforms which makes those two characters exclusive to this set because of the yellow skin. This set also includes the only version of Madam Hooch with the yellow skin.<br><br>I which LEGO could have put in three more goals in this set so that we're able to have a complete quidditch field. It's a great set to get for sure and we also don't get any stickers which you need to put on.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"orybloodmyre","2011-09-12T16:15:45.537Z","Despite Madame Hooch's choice of macho hairstyle, a great set!","<p>I got this purely as an impulse by on ebay, a few weeks back. I was bidding on the flying lesson set, and got outbid, with not enough time to rebid. I looked at the sellers other items, and found this set, which had only 1 bid. I sniped and got this for about eight pounds. It was missing a few pieces, but i've since completed it, and I like it far more than I would have&nbsp;the flying lesson set!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The highlight of this set in the stand. I love it, and love the secret entrance for the quidditch rule book, and the little bag of magic powder under the seat. It could be a little bigger,&nbsp; but I suppose its more of a refferee stand than a crowd stand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The hoops are nice looking, and its fun to try and shoot the red quaffle through the hoop using the catapault, though quickly gets boring.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Harry and Draco are nice additions, both exclusive to this set in these robes, as is madame hooch.&nbsp; I should warn people, that the broomsticks are quite fragile. My set came with some brooms which looked like they had been chewed on (or met the whomping willow!), so I bought some replacements, and after just putting them in the characters hands a few times, they are really marked and minorly scratched, which is a shame.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There isn't much more to say about this set, it has some nice mini figures, is very simplistic, has a few neat features. Deffinately worth the 8 pound I paid for it, if you can get one equally as cheap you should go for it!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,5
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-11T13:21:32.797Z","Quidditch Pitch","<p>Set #4726 Quidditch Practice: Catch the Snitch, Avoid the Beaters and Score with the Quaffle, it's Quidditch in LEGO form. But it's rather on the small side.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quidditch Practice includes all the pieces necessary to build the three scoring rings and a judge's box with Slytherin Green and Gryffindor Red for Madame Hooch to sit in. Also it is one of only two sets to include the Mini-Figure of Madame Hooch, Harry in Quidditch Uniform and Draco in Quidditch Uniform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The building is slightly repetitive, but simple and fast. There is a small hidden storage alcove under the judge's box/spectator's seat where a book on Quidditch is kept. (A unique book piece from the Harry Potter Theme, I believe this set is the only one to offer it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set also included three brooms, two brown and Draco's black broom. Overall I'd have to strongly recommend this set as a part of your Harry Potter LEGO Collection. In fact if you were to get the 2010 set and this one you would have the makings of a fine pitch for the numerous Mini-Figures. (And yellow faced Draco and Harry could be modified into different players for the two teams.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
