<p>That said, I enjoy this set for the most part, but there are some issues to consider.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box features the tower in the background of an animated picture from the movie of Rapunzel&nbsp;with a lot of pink swooshes and sparkles around the perimeter as is the norm for the Disney Princess theme/subtheme. It&#39;s defintely&nbsp;eye-catching, and if you have small children into lego you&#39;ve probably been drawn into the displays that include Rapunzel and the other Princesses. It does the job! I do like the rounded folds that some of the Friends&#39; boxes have, which is included in this set as well.</p>

<p>The instructions are basic and just what you&#39;d expect, though separated into two booklets. Given the number of pieces this isn&#39;t entirely necessary as I&#39;m quite sure a 6-12 year old could manage a few hundred pieces, especially ones as large as this.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>To the nitty gritty!</p>

<p>I really like the assortment of parts included in this set. When you buy a castle set your going for the pieces themselves. Lots of light grey structural elements, and 6 large curves that make up the walls of the tower. I liked the touch of using a couple microfigures&nbsp;as carved stone touches as well!</p>

<p>Lots of flowers and a few branch type elements, but the coolest parts for me are Rapunzels art supplies, being a Creativity Tower afterall! Included is a painter&#39;s palette&nbsp;and two paintbrushes, which are only included in one other set (though I seem to recall once in the Minifigure Theme as well), and are really quite nice to look at. There are also a few round tube elements that are used as pots of paint, and are in a nice collection of bright colours that are a little rare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A final few things to note is that this set includes a treasure chest in a light purple which I believe is a first, and I&#39;ll gladly take it. She uses it to store some of her paints. The last thing is that there is a set of circular stairs, popularized originally in the Harry Potter line of lego. These are becoming a bit more common, also appearing in the Monster Fighters, though still considered (by me) rare.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Minifigures</span></p>

<p>Rapunzel&#39;s mini doll is nicely done, and I&#39;m glad that instead of splitting her legs to accommodate for sitting they only split the back, leaving her dress from the&nbsp;front as it should be. Her hair is nicely done, a bit longer than the usual mini dolls (as it should be!), and it has three holes to allow a tiara and bows to be used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flynn looks... a little off as a mini doll. I guess it&#39;s because they only have the one mould&nbsp;for heads, but with the cheekbones he looks a little misshapen. Not the best looking male mini doll. I do like his eyebrows though, caught in an apprehensive expression.</p>

<p>I usually include any animal friends in the minifigure&nbsp;section, and I saved my favourite for the last. I really like how they did Pascal, Rapunzel&#39;s chameleon buddy. A bright green colour was used, and his curly tail is probably my fav part. He is compact yet small enough to not look out of place perched on the windowsill. He has a little hole in his head to allow a bow or other element with small pint o be used (crow from the Minifigures&#39; Scarecrow anyone!)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build didn&#39;t take much time, it is a small number of pieces and most of which are larger castle elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly the hardest part that I found was the stickers. This could potentially throw someone off the desire to grab this set (ok, who am I kidding, I got this on sale and jumped for it... stickers and all). There are two rather extensive pages, and not only are the applied to the outside of the tower on the curved elements, but they are also present on the inside of the tower on the opposing side of said curves. It is tight to get them squared off properly and esthetically pleasingly. Parents, be prepared for some upsets, AFOLs.... likewise :)</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model stands tall, probably twice as much as the Lego Friends cafes (I&#39;m sitting with them lined up across the room). The outside looks really nice with vies and flowers growing up on all sides, and the tower roof looks reeeeeally beautiful, it&#39;s a nice colour to top it off. It looks very similar to the movie images (I&#39;ve googled... le sigh).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set primarily for amount of hardtocomeby pieces, something that the entire Friends/Disney Princess line does exceedingly well. Lots of bright colours, a good selection of elements, and it wasn&#39;t a tedious model to build at all.</p>

<p>That said, the price is quite a lot for the number of pieces, though most are quite a bit bigger than your normal 2x2 bricks. And there are a lot of stickers, which by the second sheet are grumble inducing.</p>

<p>I picked it up on sale (in another city at that), rather early in the line&#39;s life which was a nice surprise. I think it&#39;s one that is better left on a wishlist, though realize that if a Frozen set is ever released (which is inevitable, I haven&#39;t seen either, though would be amazingsauce), Rapunzel&#39;s&nbsp;Creativity Tower will be in high demand.</p>

<p>C&ocirc;t&eacute; construction, j&#39;ai accompagn&eacute; ma fille de cinq ans pour le montage. Lorsque je dis &quot;accompagner&quot;, c&#39;est juste lui donner les pi&egrave;ces n&eacute;cessaires au bon moment ! La construction est plut&ocirc;t facile malgr&eacute; l&#39;&acirc;ge de six ans recommand&eacute;. Je ne l&#39;ai aid&eacute;e que lors de la pose des murs et des sols car la manipulation est plus difficile.</p>

<p>Il lui aura fallu une bonne matin&eacute;e pour monter l&#39;ensemble de la tour ; on prendre donc plaisir &agrave; passer du temps dessus. De plus, les nombreuses petites pi&egrave;ces permettent &agrave; l&#39;enfant, une fois le set d&eacute;mont&eacute;, de les r&eacute;utiliser &agrave; de nombreuses reprises, dans la limite de leur imagination.</p>

<p>C&ocirc;t&eacute; jouabilit&eacute;, on a pas mal d&#39;accessoires et quelques petits meubles sympathiques &agrave; monter. Notez la pr&eacute;sence de la po&ecirc;le afin de rejouer la fameuse sc&egrave;ne de la rencontre entre Flynn et Raiponce !</p>

<p>Au passage, h&eacute;las, seulement ces deux figurines. C&#39;est malheureusement toujours le cas dans cette gamme Disney Princesses dont la moiti&eacute; des sets n&#39;ont qu&#39;une seule figurine. Un peu trop centr&eacute;e sur les princesses et pas trop sur les autres personnages ! Pour nous consoler, il y a aussi Pascal...</p>

<p>N&eacute;anmoins, reste un d&eacute;faut, de mon point de vue d&#39;adulte (peut-&ecirc;tre moins sous l&rsquo;&oelig;il de l&#39;enfant). La tour est coup&eacute;e en deux, logique si on veut jouer dedans. Mais la profondeur est beaucoup trop faible ! Une fois que les meubles sont ins&eacute;r&eacute;s, il n&#39;y a plus de place pour faire jouer les personnages !</p>

It&rsquo;s a fairly impressive set piece and looks great on the shelf next to all the other sets, and it is loaded with fun things to do and experience as we&rsquo;ll soon discuss. A really great set and here&rsquo;s why.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her hair piece is the same as what came in the polybag set, however this time she has two bows on the back and a gold tiara on top, she comes with her little friend Pasqual the chameleon.</span></span></span></span></p>

He also has facial hair printed on his chin to match the on-screen appearance. Flynn&rsquo;s hair piece appears to be a re-use of Prince Dastan&rsquo;s hair from the Prince of Persia Theme, though I could be slightly mistaken here as that hair piece has seen wide use since being introduced.</span></span></span></span></p>

There isn&rsquo;t any terrible tricky parts here aside from placing stickers on pieces, especially the sticker meant for a LEGO book piece. I would recommend building this on a solid surface though, you don&rsquo;t want to suffer any problems with stability as you push the bricks together to build the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a quick and easy build and the roof section is even faster to build, I would estimate that each bag should take no more than twenty-eight minutes or around that long for experienced builders. Those who require more help may want to take longer and be more careful, especially with all the stickers being used.</span></span></span></span></p>

There isn&rsquo;t much to do here except open and close the spiral staircase. The second floor features more details with a fireplace and a lot of stickers for details as seen in the film Tangled, specifically this floor has the hidden picture of the floating lights and the curtains pulled back to see them.</span></span></span></span></p>

The stairs do not go to the third floor, so you&rsquo;ll have to just use your imagination, on the third floor you&rsquo;ll find a chair for Rapunzel to sit in, a small vanity with mirrored sticker for her to look in and brush her hair using the teal comb included with the set, the book (which is a cookbook) and an open balcony allowing you to have Rapunzel step out and call down for help from Flynn.</span></span></span></span></p>

Everything about this tower is just great, featuring a ton of options for play scenarios and great visual design cues taken straight out of the movie.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall an impressive model.</span></span></span></span></p>

The one flaw in an otherwise perfect design is the overreliance on stickers for all of the impressive details. Please don&rsquo;t let that deter you from an excellent set though, there&rsquo;s a lot to see and do for the younger fans and as a display set this one works quite well compared to all the others. Highly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
