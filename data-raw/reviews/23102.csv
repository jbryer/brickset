<p><strong>Contents:</strong></p>

<p>This is only the second LEGO Disney Princess set in our household and it holds up with the pattern the line established. Bright warm colors with some cooler colors and hues rounding out the packaging. Both the front and back of the box give you a good idea of what is included with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside you will find 2 instruction booklets and 2 sticker sheets. Some of the stickers are cleared back while others have a silvered color back to them. Some of these are silver enough to be mirrors and they function as such in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will be two 16 by 16 plates of a light tan color and one 8 by 16 plate in hot pink. 5 numbered bags accompany the set making the rather large box about 75% full.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There are a fair amount of good parts in this set. The printed clock piece for the Castle entrance is very good. You will get crystal hearts and other shiny objects plus keys and crowns and everything a princess needs to feel like a princess in this structure. Even ice cream!</p>

<p>Your left over parts will consist of flower stems and a few figure accessories plus an orange element separator.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is time consuming to say the least. There are quite a few assemblies that come together to make this rather large doll house plus the stickers and the care with which those cleared backed stickers need to be applied will&nbsp;consume your soul...I mean time. But it is fun and there is not too much repetition between assemblies. It is actually fun and your little Disney fan will love helping you along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>We get 2&nbsp;minidolls and 2 pests in this set. The printing is pretty good for them both and they look pretty close to their animated inspiration. As per the usual for these figurse they lack a wrist turn and both legs bent together at the waist for a seated pose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love the printing on the cat the most to be honest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Is very very big! With lots to do and see. A bath area, a make up area, a secret treasure room, a hidden letter compartment, two pet houses and a dance ring!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not to mention the castle itself is quite striking from the front. There are additional assemblies you can use outside for tea time and even a swing.&nbsp;Certainly there is a lot for a princess to do before the set becomes stale.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>This set is certainly full of features and things to do. The castle has a lot of usable space for the figures to move in and use and lots to do. The inclusion of the pets and the outdoor builds also further enhances the play value of the set and prevents everything from being locked down to the castle interior only.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only cons are the fact that the stickers are cleared back. Only one needed this treatment and it is the piece for the glass slipper. Sadly, mine did not turn out well and I really wouldve loved to have gotten at least that as a printed piece since the sticker for that is very small.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other con is its size. This thing will end up being about 32 studs wide and about 20 or 25 studs deep. There is no way to fold it or do anything to it to decrese its profile. So if you buy this make sure you have the space to put it somewhere and that your small builder will be keen to keep it where it wont cause trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given its age you should be able to pick it up for less than initial retail at this point. In my region it is still very popular but I managed to find it on sale which is a miracle in itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My little gal loves it and so does her even smaller sister. They haven&#39;t been able to tear themselves away from it for hours. If you can swing the space this is definitely a good pick up. &nbsp;Let them figure out what romance is later.</p>
