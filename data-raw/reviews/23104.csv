"Odeinoichus","2016-06-14T18:21:24Z","A DK Book Worth Owning.","<p><strong>LEGO Minifigure Year By Year A Visual History:</strong> Minifigure fans rejoice, DK publishing has given us an interesting title that features an almost complete visual guide by year of every single Minifigure ever produced. The book doesn&rsquo;t seem to be 100% complete, as there have literally been thousands of Minifigures and variant printings created since the early days of LEGO. Also sites such as Brickset do feature online visual checklists for Minifigures broken up by Themes. Still this is a nice book to have on your shelf when you have a hankering for taking a look at some of the best Minifigures by year that have been produced.</p>

<p>Presentation</p>

<p>The front cover is slightly thicker than similar books of this nature because of the need to accommodate the three Minifigures included with the book. It&rsquo;s an overall pleasant looking title with the standard plain white background drawing your eye to all the colorful Minifigures shown on the front and back covers.</p>

<p>The page layout is quite nice, they are fairly large and you won&rsquo;t have any trouble finding what you want on repeated viewings of this book. The presentation is fairly decent for a title like this and I do enjoy the way DK&rsquo;s LEGO books all have a uniform look when lined up on the shelf. It should be pointed out that this book is titled LEGO Minifigure Year by Year a Visual History, and while Duplo and other one-off styled Figures are shown in small asides, the majority of what you&rsquo;ll find here is Minifigures. In fact I don&rsquo;t recall seeing a single Big Fig in the book, however I could have simply forgotten about them as it has been a while since I read the book.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>City Prisoner: Why? Here we have the typical LEGO City crook from the 2012 era of LEGO Minifigures. There is nothing wholly wrong with him, but I find that this is a wasted slot as far as celebrating the Minifigure. A Castle Knight of old, a Pirate, or even the classic Spaceman would have been much better received. If you collect LEGO and buy up a lot of City sets than you have more than enough criminals for your collection. And with the old school Townsperson also included with this book I just have to express my utter disdain for LEGO and DK&rsquo;s choice. Bad enough they give us a stupid Stormtrooper to represent the Licensed Themes, but to lump this idiotic City Minifigure in as well. It really doesn&rsquo;t please anybody.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m certain that if they&rsquo;d gone with a knight, spaceman or pirate there would be collectors who would feel left out, so perhaps this was some weird compromise, or LEGO produced too many of this one and just shoved it in as a bonus. Either way I have taken this Minifigure with a bit of a bitter pill, since if we&rsquo;re celebrating the Minifigure year-by-year than the fact that they didn&rsquo;t choose to actually make unique Minifigures for this book is a bit of a let-down.</p>

<p>Townsperson: Traditionalists rejoice, this Minifigure captures the essence of what was found in Town sets of the distant past. A plain red torso and legs, no printing at all, with smooth brown hair piece and single-sided facial print of the traditional solid black eyes and friendly smile. I&rsquo;m glad to see this Minifigure being included to showcase the history of the Minifigure.</p>

<p>Stormtrooper: This is an ordinary looking Stormtrooper. It has a double-sided torso print, the helmet features printing and his head is the black one with face printing as though he is wearing an all-black open face ski mask. Wholly unoriginal, though he is unique to three sets. (Well two sets and the book.)</p>

<p>Contents</p>

<p>This book covers up to 2013 as far as Minifigures are concerned. It is broken up by these years with some years featuring more pages than others. You&rsquo;ll find a plethora of informative pages and interesting notations, some of which may or may not be incorrect factually&hellip; I&rsquo;m afraid I don&rsquo;t know everything so can&rsquo;t tell if an error has been made.</p>

<p>With so many years to cover it is natural to find absences, you won&rsquo;t be seeing a complete page of every single Minifigure variant released by year. It covers mostly one or two figures from each Theme, Licensed Themes begin to take over the book near the end with most of the pages showcasing a very large number of characters from the Licensed Themes. To the point where you may find quite a number of them. Even though Star Wars and other Themes have received their own books by now they are still showcased here simply because they are a part of the Minifigure history.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This book is a fun conversation piece and the fact that it features page upon page of information on Minifigures is a real pleasure. My only complaint is the choices for what to include in this book, while the Classic Townperson is an excellent choice, the fact that they wasted two slots with a City Robber and a Stormtrooper is really quite frustrating, especially when Classic Space and Castle would have been much better received. Thus the three icons of the original era of LEGO would have been quite impressive and fun.</p>

<p>Despite this particular problem I do enjoy the book and wholly recommend it. While it only goes up to 2013 it&rsquo;s possible that DK might reprint this in another decade&rsquo;s time to add further pages. Either way right now this is one of the better books based on Minifigures, it and Standing Small together are a one-two punch that you can&rsquo;t do without. Strongly Recommended.</p>
