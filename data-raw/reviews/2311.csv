The sweaters of Ron and harry are nice. Aragog is cool, I have him creeping over my computerscreen. only no dog of hagrid.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legolander","2007-05-04T04:14:05.14Z","Scary set...","I hate real spiders, but I like LEGO spider figures (with the exception of Spiderman). This set is great. Aragog really looks like the Aragog in the movie. But they only put 2 black spiders; they shoud have placed at least 3 or 4. I was wondering why there are coins in the forest, but then it's a good addition for accessories again. they should have also added 2 more square spider tiles since the scene in the movie has a lot of spiders. Anyway, this is definitely one of the best Harry Potter sets. I give it 4 stars!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MasterBuilder","2009-01-07T08:10:36.53Z","Ron, push the spiderwebs aside! Harry, I can't I'm too weak...","Good set. Harry needs to battle the acromantula, Aragog, while Ron is stuck in its web and needs to escape. Ok, good plot, and has two owls and little spider. However, although the tree is built well and the pit is good, the acromantula is a little bit badly designed. Also, the pit where Ron is has a little flat tile element with pictures of tiny spiders on it. Pathetic. I think that if there was maybe 1 more spider included, and Fang, Hagrid;s dog, it would be a 9/10. But, its still not an extremely great set, and is not at all attachable or needed to complete the Lego Hogwarts castle. Also, how does the trap catch Harry and Ron? Do they just happen to walk into a hole with spiderwebs on every side? I do not get it. Don't buy this set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-30T13:43:37.68Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Aragog in the Dark Forest Review","This spider which comes with this set is really scary but it's cool as well. It's a huge spider just like in the movie. The spider (Aragog) has a movable tail and some nice eyes and a small mouth. He also comes with 8 legs. We also get a tree where you can hide some stuff in there, an owl and a trap where you can see a place for the treasure. If you try to get the gold your minifigs (Harry Potter &amp; Ron Weasley) will be captured by 3 spiderwebs. It's a fun set and an easy build. Everything is very sturdy and you also don't have to worry about stickers. It's a great set to have if you want to play this scene from the 2nd Harry Potter movie.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"ledaKat","2009-10-19T02:04:50.59Z","This is SO SCARY!","I am terrified of spiders and all their silly legs! Why did I buy this set then you might ask? Because how often do you come across a toy that can help you face up to your fears!
Aragog is so realistic its uncanny.  The photo doesn't do him justice. He is HUGE! I have him raised up like the way a tarantula lifts his body and hisses at a preditor and Harry and Ron trapped inside the webbed forest floor leaning back in terror as he towers over them.  It sits on my shelf and sends a shiver down my spine everytime my eyes glance it.

Aragog's design is legendary. His legs are fully poseable and his body moves up and down. His big black eyes and the glowing red behind them are unnerving and the huge fangs make me feel sick. The designers should be proud of this monster. Aragog aside, I love all the sets where Harry and his friends are in Muggle clothes. I especially like Ron's jumper with the zipper. I think Ron's expression could have been more scared though, as he is probably even more scared of spiders than I think even I am.

Its a small set but quite a satisfying build because of the little tree and of course the huge spider. The colours are nice. As with Hagrid's Hut, I think this set could have done with Fang as he was right there in the thick of the spiders too. Also, I don't think it would have hurt to add a couple of extra spiders but if you have some from other sets then you can easily add to it and make the little scene crawling with the 8-legged things.  Also, if you have Escape from Privet Drive, you can use the car and fly to safety!

Pros:
Aragog
Muggle clothes
Great spiderweb trap
Works well with other H.P sets

Cons:
Not enough little spiders.

Don't be afraid of the spider its just a toy, isn't it?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
