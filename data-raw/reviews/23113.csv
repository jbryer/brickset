And then I found out it was an exclusive being sold only on site at the actual Marina Bay Sands Hotel and was very disappointed. Shortly after its release, you could only find this set in a handful of places online and the markup was substantial. While originally retailing for roughly $75, I found this on a bricklink page for over $175 with the shipping added. With such a limited release, this set was an immediate collector&#39;s item. All that aside, it&#39;s still an amazing addition to the Architecture lineup.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Excellent as always. Moving on...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The theme of the day is White and Blue. The original building appears almost as if the architect wanted to put his own cloud in the sky, and this design stays true to that theme. You get lots of Light Trans. Blue 1x2 plates, lots of Lt Trans Blue 1x4 tiles, and also lots of white 1x2 grill tiles. But the piece I enjoyed the most, aesthetically, were the lime green 1x1 round tiles, which were still brand new pieces when this set was released.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building at micro-scale can be cumbersome and repetitive at times. And no Architecture set is innocent of this. But this set relieves us of complete monotony. Each of the 3 pillars is slightly different, and the actual techniques used to create their depth and structure are very interesting. The creation of the top of the hotel, including the infinity pool, is also a fun step. There are definitely some techniques used that I plan to utilize in my own designs now.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a beauty, for sure. The&nbsp;light colors on a dark base really give it that &quot;oasis in a desert&quot; feel that pays homage to the original structure. It&#39;s an extremely attractive model with a clean and sleek design. This model has been proudly on display in my home for over a year now.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a tragedy that this model did not see wider release. The unique design would have looked amazing on the shelves of Lego Lovers of all ages. Is it worth the mark-up? I don&#39;t know. For the die hard collector, it&#39;s a no brainer: Yes, seek out this set. But it&#39;s getting to the point that it would be cheaper to buy individual pieces on bricklink.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very happy that I bought it, though my wallet may disagree. It&#39;s a pleasure to build, break apart, look at, and show off. Of all of the Architecture sets, this is one of the most beautiful.</p>

"Neits","2015-05-30T16:19:23.25Z","Awesome to build from spare parts","<p>I have&nbsp;to start this review by precising&nbsp;that I don&#39;t technically own this set. I have never bought it, so I have no box or instruction or &quot;Marina Bay Sands&quot; printed plate, but I have collected all the 600 parts needed to build it.<br />
And it was worth it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The hardest parts to find were, of course, all the Trans-Light Blue ones (approx. 150 of them). Some White parts were tricky to find too, but after several&nbsp;hours of searching on BrickLink, I was about to acquire all missing parts for roughly $50. Considering this is an Architecture set consisting of&nbsp;600 parts, I am pretty satisfied about the price-per-piece ratio&nbsp;:-)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Putting so much time and effort into collecting the parts had to be rewarding in the end. And it was ! The build is 90% SNOT, from the structure of each building to the intricate combinations that hold the windows to the buildings. The roof is a nice finish, making you SNOT all the way around it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very pleasing to look at. I think the overall curved effect was impossible to perfectly render in Lego at this scale,&nbsp;but it is very subtly suggested, as you realize when you step away from the model and observe both front and back of the 3 buildings.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;d recommend the building of&nbsp;this set to any fan of the Architecture theme with both time and patience on his/her hands. The result is&nbsp;beautiful and deserves a place in any Lego collection, for its look as much as the techniques it features.</p>
