"spokeydokeyjenner_jones","2014-01-14T16:02:11.383Z","Up, up and (a)Way Out West!","<p>Hello, and good to see you all here again. Now, before I start, may I say this; this is my first review of 2013- no, wait...sorry, 2014. You wonder why there haven&#39;t been any reviews from me in 2013? Well, there are many reasons (hibernation, zombie apocalypse, Black Plague, civil war, prolonged illness, etc), but probably not. To make up for it, I am about to review one of the new LEGO movie sets. Being an AFOL (Adult Fan of LEGO, not a man named Adolf spelt in an anagram), I shall review the Getaway Glider.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Now, the box if I&#39;m not mistaken has the same feel of the LEGO Lone Ranger and LEGO Super Heroes sets; this being a step-up from the thin-cardboard boxes which make them a bit chunky almost like a pair of fancy boots made of buffalo leather. The instructions are very well detailed in every inch and should illustrate where the pieces must go. So finally, when you finish the model, you turn the next page of the booklet to find - get a load of this - details of The LEGO Movie, but only few sets of the range advertised.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The hats look new and very fitting (the sheriff&#39;s hat which is a completely new sculpt in which LEGO is giving BrickWarriors a run for their money and maybe a possibility of bringing back their long-since discountinued Western theme - maybe one day, perhaps, but then again, they already made LEGO Lone Ranger sets, so well done chaps; the deputy&#39;s hat is a Lone Ranger Stetson they made in brown for the first time - we&#39;ve seen mostly white ones and one or two ones in black). As well as decals you have to put on yourself, what I found was they still made the original LEGO revolvers unlike the Lone Ranger ones which are much better and detailed. The chains, for some reason, are shorter than the usual ones (unless you wanted to make some sort of ghost minifigure or out-of-season Halloween MOC).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>My favourites out of this set are a tie between Sheriff Not-a-robot and Deputron.</p>

<p>Sheriff Not-a-robot - that name reminds me of Yul Brynner&#39;s character from Westworld (1973 film) and Kurt Russell as Wyatt Earp from Tombstone (1993), only futuristic with Terminator edges to him. He&#39;s clearly one of the best minifigures because of the torso and leg printing, but humorously, they added a comedy mustache (a seperate piece on the figure, no doubt) to him implying his name when in fact he is a robot. A lot of cartoon characters have used mustaches to imply they&#39;re somebody else through the power of disguises, so that&#39;s what this robot is trying to do in the movie, I guess.</p>

<p>Next is Deputron, which has great printing on the torso and legs, but on the head, it&#39;s got like this sort of Robocop and Judge Dredd style to it. Maybe he&#39;s like a prototype of Robocop sent back in time to the Old West (not the Wild West, so it&#39;s rude to confuse the two), that&#39;s what I was thinking. I like him as well because I like the Wild West best.</p>

<p>Now, our last minifigure is Emmet. He appears in almost every set (unless you want to build a collection of him). He has this brick on his back which was later revealed to the Piece of Resistance (or so it&#39;s claimed). In the movie, the red brick is glued to his back, but in merchandising, the extra piece the minifigure requires does not appear in the film. Still, I have seen pictures of the set, so I think he looks great (despite having two faces printed on him, he looks like something tragic and horrific has happened). Still, great figure, though I like his confident face best.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Well, the building was no trouble, really. Being an AFOL, I am an veteran at this and have never once lost my charm. The model is something kids would make up themselves and maybe having used their minds to it. This set didn&#39;t take long for me to build so I&#39;m sure it won&#39;t for anybody else.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve built it and it looks like one of the strangest gliders out of the movie. I haven&#39;t seen it yet, but only in the very first trailer as the film has yet to be released and then I can see how Emmet builds this man-powered flying machine that would&#39;ve pre-dated the Wright Brothers, but Emmet wasn&#39;t wrong. The glider still moves and Emmet is supposed to fit via the red brick on his back, but he&#39;s supposed to hold onto the chains like in the box, I guess. The cactus is no problem and it also makes part of the background.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set, in every way is a good one and (if you&#39;re desperate) easy to obtain an Emmet minifigure of your very own or to build a mini-collection if you&#39;re a billionaire. Thank you all very much and I promise to make more reviews soon. This is me, Spokeydokey, signing off!</p>

"suprajames","2014-03-15T23:13:30.9Z","Not a bad set, but could have been better.","<p>This is my first ever review so please be gentle, though I would start off with a small set from the new Lego Movie before I start with the bulk of my collection which is OT Star Wars sets. &nbsp;I picked up Getaway Glider today from my local Supermarket while doing some shopping, they as a rule do not stock Lego or any toys, but can imagine with the massive success&nbsp;of The Lego Movie they have jumped on the band wagon to try and cash in. &nbsp;Anyway let&#39;s get on with this review...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is only a small set of just over 100 pieces and so only requires a small box, usual Lego Movie branding and depicting a scene set in the Old West of Emmet looking terrified as the glider swoops over Sheriff&nbsp;Not-a-robot on his horse and Deputron. Rear of box shows that Emmet is removable from the glider and that the weathervan spins round. &nbsp;Not a bad box picture and lets you know exactly what the set is if you have not seen the movie. &nbsp;Instructions are a small easy to follow 28 page booklet, last three pages are adverts for other Lego Movie products and then final page is parts inventory as per usual.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Mainly brown shades parts wise as the glider is suppose to be made of wood, nothing really special, few flat tiles, radiator grilles, and some small plates. &nbsp;Weathervane&nbsp;is simulated with silver grey parts and a nifty chicken piece, other&nbsp;colours&nbsp;include some dark tan wings and some buffalo horns. You also get a small sticker sheet to show the two signs that are used in the building of the glider in the movie.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three mini figures are included in the set, which is not bad for a small and lower priced set, they are standard Emmet with the Piece Of Resistance on his back, and a head with two expressions. &nbsp;Sheriff Not-a-robot who comes with two revolvers, a great moustache&nbsp; and of course his trusty steed, with posable&nbsp;head and hind legs, so can be made to rear up if required. Last on the list is Deputron the Sheriff&#39;s sidekick, both the Sheriff and Deputron&nbsp;have detailed printing on their torso&#39;s but Deputron also has much more detailed legs with a low slung bullet belt and cowboy boots showing. Deputron&nbsp;also has the Lego Movie standard robot larger blaster.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>At 104 pieces this is never going to be a long build and took me under ten minutes to complete but was enjoyable all the same. &nbsp;Started off assembling the mini figures, adding hats, weapons etc etc, then you build a small Lego cactus and onto the glider, main body the. a wing at a time before clipping the wings to the glider body. &nbsp;Not a very difficult or complex build but at &pound;11.99 what more can you ask for.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>In it&#39;s completed state the model is nice to look at, has some nice touches but still feel it is lacking something (see below), also it is quite fragile and hard to display.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Again as I said this is smaller and lower priced set so I was not expecting it to be that amazing, mini figures are good, glider is pretty cool but what would have made this set better is a clear stand for the glider to be held up by, like the Ewok Glider in the various sets they came in, would be great if it looked like the glider was actually in the air. &nbsp;Also this would make this set much easier to display, as currently the glider is just laying on its back and can not be stood up in any way, I would have gladly swapped the cactus out for a stand. Also the weathervane/barrel piece is quite fragile and with the slightest knock detaches from the main glider body. Overall not a bad set for the price but feel with the addition of a flight stand this set would have been better.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-09-21T17:13:31.287Z","They're slowly getting away.","<p><strong>Set #70800 Getaway Glider: </strong>The LEGO Movie Theme has proven quite popular, so I&#39;m returning to more reviews of sets I own during the weekend since college has started up again and classes are even more intense than before. So I&#39;m going to start with set #2 of the smaller boxed sets, is it good or worth picking up? Let&#39;s find out shall we.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The boxes for the Theme are all really fun, the design stands out as one of the more eye catching from LEGO compared to past Themes. It kind of reminds me of the old Studios Theme design, though it isn&#39;t exactly the same.</p>

<p>For a set this small there isn&#39;t much to be said about the set&#39;s box design. It stands out with a good looking action scene and that&#39;s about it. It shows a few tiny features, as the set really doesn&#39;t have many and that&#39;s that.</p>

<p>The instructions are what they are, easy to follow without any problems and pretty typical for a set at this price point. There isn&#39;t much else to be said.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has relatively few pieces. Some of them are unique, the rest are pretty fun and some are even brand new. There are two cow horns, a silver chicken, the piece of resistance, two new mini-figure mustache accessories and that&#39;s about it. The theme of the set is Wild West and it works well with the tan and dark brown pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You have three mini-figures in this set, Emmet, Deputron and Sheriff Not-A-Robot. These are by far some of the best Mini-Figures in a set of this size. Mostly for the comedic value they represent.</p>

<p>Emmet is the same we&#39;ve seen in many other Movie sets... Or we will see as I finish off reviewing these sets of course. There isn&#39;t much else to say about him that I didn&#39;t cover in the Melting Room set as they are both the same figure.</p>

<p>Deputron is a Wild West member of the Super Secret Police... Unless Lord Business has different group names for each area of the universe. He&#39;s a pretty nifty looking robo-westerner. He has a double-sided torso which may be new, although it could be a re-used print from Lone Ranger... No probably not, the deputy badge is gold rather than silver and while the print design might be familiar I suspect it&#39;s unique. He has leg printing as well with a lot of detail for the pants, belt with ammo and brown cowboy boots he&#39;s wearing.</p>

<p>His head print is similar to other robo figures, though I feel it&#39;s unique, the eye design is similar to one of the Robo-SWATs, but I think his mouth is different. He has a brown cowboy hat and the new gun design for accessories and that&#39;s all there is to say about him.</p>

<p>Sheriff Not-A-Robot: This is the best Mini-Figure in this set, his print is similar to the Lone Ranger, by which I mean this character is homaging the other character. The double-sided torso print with the jacket and sheriff star, the minimal leg print showing only the bottom of his long coat, the belt with the tucked in pistol and the under jacket and tie.</p>

<p>His hat is a black version of the Lone Ranger&#39;s hat and he&#39;s wielding two guns. The robot face is really menacing looking with bared teeth and scruffy looking black hair and stubble. The best accessory of all time has been introduced as well. The mustache, it&#39;s a great new piece that resembles the fake mustaches found in TT LEGO games as a bonus unlock. Definitely worth getting the set for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is the kind of set that features only a single build, the glider really looks similar to the one shown in the movie and the build is pretty faithful though I do think it&#39;s slightly smaller than the on-screen version. Just a little. I like the build in this set, even if it is an awkward looking vehicle that can&#39;t sit anywhere on a shelf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Glider is pretty sweet, however I do think LEGO should have gone for printed elements instead of stickers. We&#39;ve seen printed tiles before it wouldn&#39;t have been that hard to print the words on the tiles from the parts taken during the escape rather than making them stickers. Especially since in a set this size you run the risk of having the sheet bent badly in the box. I think the weather vane is the best part of this model, it is a clever little build and features some nice pieces, the old aquazone spear in silver grey plastic and the new chicken in a matching colour. Love the look of it.</p>

<p>The horse and small brick built cactus only add to the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is the second small set and one of the cheapest methods of getting the Special AKA Emmet. It&#39;s a much better cohesive set compared to the Melting Room, while I did find the Melting Room ok and it&#39;s the only set with hood up Wildstyle so far, this one has a much better model and Mini-Figure selection. On top of this the build just works better and stands out as more unique than the pitiful excuse for a set piece from 70801 and the mini-figures are all winners in my book. Kind of wish we could see more wild west themed sets with robots in 2015.</p>

<p>Recommended, especially for that mustache.</p>

"lego613master","2014-05-28T22:14:06.93Z","To infinity.... or the ground!","<p>I bought this set at my local Target with money I received from my grandmother for a holiday. Normally, I would have saved my money for a larger (&gt;$75) set, but this set had a horse (which I enjoy collecting) and Emmet (whom I did not yet own). So, it interested me enough, and I got it. I don&#39;t regret it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is fine; I ripped it apart in the car anyways since I honestly don&#39;t care much about boxes. For those of you who do, however, the box is the normal $12-set-sixed box, with a thumb tab, pics front and back, and the normal text &amp; information. As all TLG sets, the front of the box is more appealing than other, such as City, boxfronts, but as I said before this isn&#39;t much of an issue in my opinion. Instructions are OK as well; mine were slightly bent but nothing an hour under a book can&#39;t fix.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are superb in this set; notable ones include Sheriff Not-A-Robot and Deputron&#39;s cowboy hats, Deputron&#39;s gun, Sheriff&#39;s mustache, the new 1x2x2 dk. brown slopes, the silver rooster, the Piece of Resistance, and two silver spears/harpoons.. Most of the other parts I already have (given the scope of my collection, that should tell you that they are faily common), but some are interesting &amp; most are very useful nonetheless. The clip-stick-hole parts are also nice; I didn&#39;t have those beforehand. The horse is nice, and useful for anyone who has a lot of models or MOCs centred on the timeframe from about 1000-1800 AD.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three minifigures are included: the two robocops, and Emmet. The robocops are superb, and as their bodies contain no other technological additions other than their heads, can be easily converted to a normal set of lawmen. Sheriff&#39;s mustache piece (which comes with an extra) is quite a novelty. I had loads of fun trying the extra on various minifigs, and showing them off! :-D Printing is prevalent on their torsos and legs, and easily portrays their Wild West-era garb.</p>

<p>Emmet is fairly normal (naturally). As most other Emmets, he has printed orange legs (with construction worker-themed danger stripes), a printed orange shirt with much the same, blue longsleeves, and a double-sided scared/happy(determined) face. His hair, with the mini colic at the back, is sufficient for use in other custom minifigures. His hair, unfortunately, lets the bottom of his screaming face through, a complaint I&#39;m sure that many of the AFOL perfectionists will strongly dislike.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Upon receiving the set, I attempted to do what I had read at least one other Bricksetter does; build the set without the instructions, and only from the box. Being new at this, I finished the wings and then was stuck. Rebuilding the model, at least two or three interesting techniques were used, although none of them are groundbreaking.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Wondering what the title of my review was about? I&#39;m getting to that. Emmet&#39;s glider is the absolute most unairworthy model probably ever produced by LEGO, not to mention the most unlikely to ever work. Including a large protrusion in the back to accommodate the weathervane contraption, as well as the rear steering fins, the model is around 4 studs wide, and only about four times that wide. Not to mention, the wings have very large amounts of what may be called &#39;greebling&#39; on them, and are themselves horribly thick (a brick&#39;s worth in some places). Were Emmet to attempt to fly in this thing, Vitruvius would have to find himself a new Special very quickly.</p>

<p>As a model, there is almost no swooshability, not to mention that the flapping motion produced by the contraption in front of Emmet is gimmicky. It really doesn&#39;t work too well; due partially to being somewhat short and awkward, and also because the mechanism itself isn&#39;t the greatest.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For the parts, the set is quite good. For playability, not so much. The two robocoppers are very nice as well. If you collect pre-1900s sets, this is a set for you. If not, then you&#39;de be better off with The Melting Chamber.</p>

"Hashem1983","2015-03-01T14:50:36.553Z","A Shortcut Set To Get Cool Items","<p>This is the starter set of the Lego Movie sets yet it has a&nbsp;lot to offer. This is the set when Wyldstyle&nbsp;created this for Emmet&nbsp;while they were Running &nbsp;away with Vitruvius from&nbsp;the police and the Sheriff in the Wild-West &quot;Realm&quot;. Sadly it does not come with Wyldstyle and Vitruvius.</p>

<p>It comes in a decent size box showing the main artwork on the front and the features of the set in the back, and one Instruction booklet, it is easy to build but not symmetrical.</p>

<p>The parts are not that rare, but in my opinion the studs in silver are and you do get a spare stud, you can store it in your Lego Treasure box as a silver piece.</p>

<p>I bought the set for two main things, Emmet&nbsp;&amp; the new Horse style.</p>

<p>Emmet comes with double face, a smart looking face and a panicking&nbsp;look for him. Two great looking Robo-Cowboys, with great cowboy hats and the one in the black suit&nbsp;has a moustache,&nbsp;all of&nbsp;the minifigs has double sided printing on the Torsos and printing on their legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Cowboy in the black suit has 2 guns, and he is the one riding the horse that has a grey saddle, the brown cowboy has a laser gun, and the Glider for Emmet.</p>

<p>?The set itself can be easily&nbsp;folded and store once you tack off the sticks with the chains and the barrel with the weather vane.</p>

<p>- Great selection of minifigs, including Emmet</p>

<p>- Good price, considering the horse</p>

<p>Dislikes:</p>

<p>- The glider. For display, it&#39;s far from great.&nbsp;All of the interesting details, including all stickers, are on the under side of the wing. The negative of the bricks are the upside, which gets far more exposure than anything. It almost look like the glider is upside down.</p>

<p>- For play, again, the glider doesn&#39;t work. The wings are fairly secure, but the tail and roster/nose thing, are all 1 stud connections and fall off very easily</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s an ok model if you could buy it at the old retail price. I would not suggest it for much more than that value, unless, of course, you are a completionist.</p>

<h3>The Sheriff, His Deputy, and His Horse</h3>

<p>I personally think the LEGO team made a great job on the Sheriff and Deputron. The faces are both unique to them. The moustache part for the Sheriff is great, and the set has two. The set also brings three revolvers and one laser gun. The horse is good, and has a brick to fill the saddle area when not being ridden. The hats are great as well, with the Sheriff&#39;s bring printed.</p>

<h3>Emmet and His Glider</h3>

<p>The glider is visibly&nbsp;built great as well. Lots of great parts. Silver chicken, two arrows, cow horns, staffs, old brown barrel. Some gold parts as well. The sticker parts can be used to create a bank&nbsp;sign and a keep out sign. I really like&nbsp;this build. However, the chain and support for Emmet are hard to use. I also don&#39;t like the neck bracket used to hold the piece of resistance &ndash;&nbsp;they could have used one with a TECHNIC pin rather than just a stud to hold it.&nbsp;It&#39;s rather weak... Otherwise, I love it!</p>

<h3>The Cactus</h3>

<p>It&#39;s... a cactus. Comes with a brick yellow&nbsp;2x4 plate as a &quot;stand&quot;. It&#39;s an alright build, but suffers from the lack of a flower bud.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a great set. Lots of great parts, it&#39;s a must-have. Especially if you&#39;re in need for Old West-themed parts. Thanks for reading my review!</p>
