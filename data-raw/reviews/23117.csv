"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2014-03-12T01:47:43.613Z","Rest in Pieces...","<p>To start: I am a big fan of the LEGO Movie, and it was viewing the film more times than anything I&#39;ve seen in theaters that caused me to get this set. Obviously, this 311 piece set is not the biggest set of them all, but it&#39;s a good one, and provides a solid experience while offering solid play value, even while being slightly misrepresentative of its original scene. But, fortunately for me, discussing spoilers is not what I&#39;m here to do. To start with the figures, the set exclusively contains the dual faced Bad Cop/Good Cop, as well as Emmet. Bad Cop&#39;s signature blaster, one of the new stud-launching models that is present in the movie. Everything you&#39;d expect minus a chair for him to kick around. Emmet is the same as in the other sets, with the Piece of Resistance on his back as well as calm and scared expressions. Additionally, two police crocs are included, in a darker green color than older models.</p>

<p>The first section of the set is the end of the ruined train track with a collapsing edge, meant to simulate Bad Cop shooting the rails. The stick under the rails to simulate this is simple but yet very effective, reminiscent of the stunts in the old Studios sets. Although it doesn&#39;t happen in the movie, there&#39;s a small handle for Emmet to hang off of to add more play value. While the smaller of the two sections, it still stands tall. The main section happens to be Bad Cop&#39;s police ship, and while it doesn&#39;t&nbsp;rebuild into a regular car like the other &quot;transforming&quot; models, this&nbsp;one in particular doesn&#39;t really need the feature, as it is a solid vehicle for Bad Cop. The only features to this ship are pop out laser cannons, which work out perfectly and can retract to give the ship that sleek look. (And nowhere in the instructions was there a way to rebuild it like Batman does in the film).</p>

<p>Overall, I was very satisfied with the set. It represents its source material well, fits in with whatever theme you&#39;d really want it to, and offers a great play value. High marks from me.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-09-21T18:46:36.65Z","End of the Line","<p><strong>Set #70802 Bad Cop&#39;s Pursuit: </strong>This set is one of the funner offerings from the Theme, unfortunately it is a little bit weak too on the Mini-Figures front since you only get two of them in this set compared to other sets priced similarly. Other than that though it&#39;s a pretty good set and here&#39;s why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I really am running out of things to say about these boxes. It depicts the set and it&#39;s features brilliantly, looks great on the shelf and attracts the eye. Summation, good job LEGO.</p>

<p>The instructions show you each step of the build broken up by the numbered bags. They don&#39;t have any checklists in them so you can&#39;t keep track of all the Mini-Figures in the Theme like other Themes have. They do a serviceable job though for what they are, LEGO instructions don&#39;t need much else to work well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m honestly at a loss here folks. This set doesn&#39;t jump out at me when it comes to parts, the full build is the real grab of the set not the individual pieces. Although I suppose the new stud launcher is a nice new part, but you&#39;re going to lose a lot of studs firing it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two in this set, a bit of a let-down honestly. I suppose the crocodiles could be counted as characters, but honestly most of the 2-1 sets from the Theme are the same price as this set and feature at least three Mini-Figures per set. It would have been nice to have another Robo-SWAT or maybe another Master Builder such as Michelangelo. (The artist not the ninja turtle.)</p>

<p>Anyway, the Mini-Figures are Emmet, with the same print details and the facial expressions as all the others we&#39;ve seen so not much to add to him really.</p>

<p>Bad Gop/Good Cop is the other Mini-Figure in the set and he&#39;s really fun, with a great looking print that resembles the ones we&#39;ve seen on Robo-SWATS design wise. His belt buckle has a C on it, I&#39;m assuming for the Cop part of his name. His helmet is a great new piece as well and he&#39;s got the good cop, bad cop facial expressions printed on the head.</p>

<p>I just love the look of this Mini-Figure and I&#39;m pretty impressed with the character, since it takes the double-sided facial prints to a whole new level. He&#39;s a great looking figure and I&#39;m impressed they made him.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set has three numbered bags, each bag builds one element of the set. The better build of the set is the police cruiser which is built with bag&#39;s two and three. I love this vehicle build, the steps are really impressive making a vehicle that almost looks like a hover cruiser from Back to the Future. (Or Blade Runner), the first bag builds a section of the railway tracks that were featured prominently in this scene and it does look good, though it could use a bit more, maybe include half a train car or something.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The section of train tracks doesn&#39;t offer much to it honestly, it&#39;s a solid build with a good working gimmick of having a section of the track drop off to send Emmet plummeting to his death. With the Robo-Crocs at the bottom, it&#39;s a dangerous threat that Emmet needs to escape with help.</p>

<p>The Police Cruiser is an awesome build, it reminds me a little of the speeders from Attack of the Clone&#39;s Bounty Hunter Pursuit set, it&#39;s a solid vehicle and fun to play with being awesomely swooshable. The built in laser guns are a clever build with some neat storage features, I do however dock a few points off it for including stickers for the details instead of prints. A set this size I can see why they&#39;d use stickers, however I think I could argue that printed details for police cruisers could be used in more than one set. Considering how many Police sets exist in LEGO City.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&#39;d have to say this is an almost perfect set. The build is awesome good fun and the Bad Cop/Good Cop Mini-Figure is a great character, quite frankly the only thing this set has against it is the price and the number of Mini-Figures included for that price, most 30$ sets at least have three Mini-Figures in them these days, four if you have something cheap like Battle Droids in them. I suppose the inclusion of the crocodiles might have been the reason for why you only got two characters in, but I think I would have preferred losing one of the crocs for another unique Mini-Figure.</p>

<p>Still I&#39;m saying this is highly recommended for the build alone, the vehicle is just awesome. And is&nbsp;a huge draw for this set.</p>
