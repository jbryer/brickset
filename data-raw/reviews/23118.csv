"Odeinoichus","2014-09-21T20:40:49.343Z","Where no rules and no bad feelings allowed","<p><strong>Set # 70803 Cloud Cuckoo Land: </strong>Though the set was not actually what we saw in the film&#39;s animated portions (the set may have featured in a box off to the side during the live action scene) this set still has it&#39;s uses. For one thing you get Unikitty in it and she&#39;s super cute, plus a buildable snail element.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s discuss this set&#39;s many fun features.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Again the box is great, it does what LEGO wants it to do, namely showcasing a fun looking set.&nbsp;A shame there aren&#39;t more features for it to showcase here.</p>

<p>The instructions include a poster for the DC Super Heroes Mini-Figures. I do kind of wish LEGO would have made it a poster for the LEGO Movie Mini-Figures. The manual is well put together aside from this cross-promotional image. The steps are easy to follow and they do showcase most of the sets from the Theme like the other manuals, I&#39;m just sad not to see a mini-figure checklist for this Theme since it would let you keep track of everything seeing as the Theme does have a lot of Mini-Figures and if you dispose of the boxes the names aren&#39;t featured anywhere else.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is loaded with great parts, mostly in Friends colours, pastel pinks, bright teal,&nbsp;various&nbsp;shades of&nbsp;yellow and orange,&nbsp;and lime green. It&#39;s a great parts pack for differently coloured pieces. The old style castle walls from the 80&#39;s are also in a new unique green colour which I&#39;m sure will be very useful for MOCers.&nbsp;There&#39;s also the R5 droid head piece without any printing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The mini-figures in this set consists of three mini-figures and two buildable characters.</p>

<p>Emmet is using the same torso and legs as before, but this time he&#39;s got a different set of facial expressions. One side showing a toothy smile while the other has a worried teeth gritting expression. This version also has the tracking device stud on his leg so that the villains can track him down.</p>

<p>Wildstyle is the same as the one in the Melting Room except of course this one features a new hood piece that sits around the neck, showing when she&#39;s wearing it down so you can see her hair. The hair piece is great looking, with the one sided ponytail and the printed pink and blue stripes.</p>

<p>Executron is one of the many robots employed by Lord Business, this one is a businessman type or executive, and he&#39;s wearing a simple business suit with only the front torso print. The hair looks nice, I think we&#39;ve seen it before. And the facial print is awesome, wearing large sunglasses and with rivets to make cheek lines.</p>

<p>Unikitty is plainer than her Biznis Kitty counterpart, the only printing is on the 1X3 brick used for her face. With a big happy open mouthed smile of greeting. She&#39;s a cute looking brick built character and honestly there isn&#39;t much else to say here.</p>

<p>Snail is another brick built character, we saw him (her?) briefly in the film during the big entrance to cloud cuckoo land, so it isn&#39;t as if the inclusion here is random, and I do like the build for this character. Unfortunately it&#39;s just a shame we don&#39;t know much about the character.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest the build here isn&#39;t much to write home about, it&#39;s not much of a palace, however as a cloud cuckoo set piece it does work. There are no numbered bags in this set, which is normal for 25$ sets, so you&#39;ll have to separate the pieces before building if you prefer that method of building. I do like the fake sun build though, it&#39;s kind of fun and uses a nice combination of orange and yellow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model as I mentioned above does tend to look different from the movie&#39;s representation of this particular location. It doesn&#39;t have much going for it, it&#39;s got small geared spiny things using umbrella pieces and a crystal clear flower launcher catapult. I was originally going to just skip this set, but after seeing the movie I kind of fell in love with it even though it is kind of plain. And random. The best aspect of the model is the clashing match-up of multiple bright colours and plain white pieces, and it does look good on the shelf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I&#39;d recommend it for the pieces and fans of fun unique builds. Also the character choice here is fairly impressive, I like that Emmet has a different face print and the new hood accessory for Wildstyle is a great looking piece. Plus it&#39;s Unikitty, no matter what she&#39;s going to look cute and fun. If you&#39;ve been late to collecting this Theme and are looking for a Unikitty this is the cheapest option for her character.</p>

<p>Great fun set worth picking up.</p>

<p>The box says this if for ages 7-14, but &quot;<span style=""font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">That&#39;s a suggestion. They have to put that on there.&quot; The instructions were &nbsp;easy to follow, I wish they made instructions for installing a new kitchen faucet this easy.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Everything is awesome if you already don&#39;t have &nbsp;Emmett and the piece of resistance. This is the same Lucy that was used in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30281-1/Micro-Manager-Battle"">Micro Manager</a> set (30281). I really like the &quot;suited up/ man in black&quot; Robo cop (Executron), he means business. Lets not forget the uni-kitty and Snail that round off this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>After sorting though the tiny pieces the build was not to challenging, &nbsp;I actually did it on the &quot;first try.&quot;&nbsp;I was able to build it and at the same time cook a delicious&nbsp;taco dinner for my family (It was a&nbsp;Tuesday.)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>If you want this model to stay together you&#39;ll have to kragle it. The clutch power is weak in some areas, and after a few visits to Cloud Cukoo Palace it was beginning to fall apart, not from a attack from Lord Business&#39; minions, but from a over-joyed 3 year old..&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you have 20 US dollars burning a hole in your pocket it&#39;s not a bad set, if money is limited I would look elsewhere.The highlight of the set for me&nbsp;was the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/tlm028/Executron"" style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); text-decoration: none;"">Executron</a>&nbsp;mini-fig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes in a box with the standard design of The Lego Movie sets. Honestly i can care less about the box and instructions unless they look like they were put in a paper shredder.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces that come in this set are very colorful. You do get some nice pieces like the flower pieces, star pieces, and technic ball pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Emmet: This figure, while not that special, is great. This Emmet&nbsp;has the better face that to me seems more like Emmet</p>

<p>?Wyldstyle: This figure is fantastic. While it is in the super-cycle chase, it still is a great figure with the hair and that amazing hood piece</p>

<p>Executron: Basic figure. However, the face printing is very good. Just there for the sake of playability.</p>

<p>Unikitty: While some may not count this as a minifigure, i&#39;m going with the box. This figure is great. The printing is very good an the tail piece is great. Also if you saw the movie, you automatically want this figure in your collection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the build is fun especially due to all the colorful parts. WARNING: build may cause seizures due to bright colors! (joking)</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set is very appealing to the eye. The flower catapult adds some playability, the snail is very fun, and overall, is a very fun set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set. It isnt my favorite set from this line, but isnt&nbsp;far off. This set will be popular with fans of the movie like me and girls. Well Worth $20</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty much what you would expect from the Lego Movie sets; bright and colourful and is able to include some action scene, as also seen in the movie. It lures the children in with its bright candy colours, waving sun, and blue and pink flowers. Emmet&#39;s bonded with the Piece of Resistance and it even includes Wyldstyle and the perky Unikitty. To a young child this set looks like a ton of fun to put together; and they&#39;re not wrong. The instructions remain very clear and concise as all Lego sets&#39; instructions are.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is aimed to children between the ages of 7-14 but it is really more designed for a child of the age of 5;&nbsp;(the only reason it isn&#39;t is due to the incredible amount of small pieces in the set). I say this because the set itself is overly simple and is aimed as more a decorative set than a playset. The colorful pieces are awesome to hold and see and are also collectibles which makes adult Lego collectors happy to have. The snail piece is cute and fun to build, but other than the bright pieces and more figures to add to your Lego Movie collection, this set doesn&#39;t have very much left to offer. The shooting accessory is kind of weak in design and not nearly as good as the shooters on the Micromanager in Batman and Super Angry Kitty Attack or Metalbeard&#39;s&nbsp;Duel.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Comes with all double-sided faces excluding Unikitty (which comes with one) and while Emmet&#39;s expressions are adorable, Wyldstyle&#39;s are boring. They both look exactly the same.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Short to build but easy to get distracted with all the cool pieces. It took me about 20-30 mins to complete. Some of the structures are a little weak and you hae to be careful to follow instructions completely otherwise you&#39;ll end up breaking half the set just to switch out a piece.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Cute and colourful, but not very much play can be had with this set. The most I can see children doing is maybe flinging the flower ammo at the figures while playing a chase scene, but een then there isn&#39;t much set to chase in. The only thing I can see making this set better is if kids get inspired to upgrade their Cuckoo Palace and add their own pieces to it to make it bigger and better, like it is in the movie. Like I also said before, it can still make a cute desk toy for us adult Lego collectors.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very pretty to look at, but for what the Lego Movie gave us with the Palace&#39;s design, I would hae expected something a little better and more intricate.&nbsp;</p>
