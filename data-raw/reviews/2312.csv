"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-11T05:18:48Z","One of the best Harry Potter sets","I have to admit to still liking this set a bit, the house isn't too bad and the car is nice.  On the downside, it has those yucky coloured roof bricks, and the selection of bricks in the set aren't very versatile for building alternative models.  No brilliant figures in this set either.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-10T12:18:01Z","A very nice set.","Lego has done such an amzing job with most of the Harry potter sets. I bought this one when it went on sale and have not had one bit of regret in doing so. The best thing about this set is the car. Great design there.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-01T00:12:14Z","best harry potter set","The reason I think so is because of the car and the items which relate to harry potter such as books spiders etc. The car is really good and there is actually enough luggage room to put stuff in the back.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-01-07T15:57:45.39Z","cute!","i usually don't buy hp-sets, came across this one coincidentally, but this set is a real pleasure. 
at first i grumbled at the 6-wide car, but as a matter of fact it foreshadows the city models of today, which are all in 6-wide ore even larger... also it is very well built, and 2 figures can sit in it.
the house may miss some walls, but it is so neatly and carefully made up, with lots of lovely details, i am sure a woman designed it (no offence)! i still plan to extend it and give it a full roof, because the colour scheme is very appealing.
chrome and light blue parts just complete the overall impression.

applause for this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"bsmarthen","2007-05-13T12:09:01.26Z","Another harry!","Nice set which of coarse has harry in it. Still has a very cool car and other new minifigs. The house is ok for while mine didnt stay that way for long. Used it to build other things. The car really makes this set worth it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-10-28T21:25:11.5Z","Really Good HP Set","This is a very unique set because you get a house, a really detailed car, and 3 minifigs. The car has some rare colored pieces like the light blue pieces. The house is also pretty good too. This is a fine set to have if you are a HP fan.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-07-22T14:16:47.623Z","Harry's old house","I love the fact that LEGO did a great job on Ron Weasley's car. It has many great details including a trunk and passenger seats. The car by far is my favorite part of this set. The minifigures are nice too, with Ronald Weasley, Harry Potter, and Uncle Vernon. It is definetley worth $30 and if you buy 2 more of these and take out the minifigures and replace them with new ones, you've got Harry Potter's neighborhood!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-09T18:04:04.297Z","Boring, small, lacking, unrealistic","This set doesn't have enough detail. The hinged back is pointless. The car is bulky and bad. Where's the living room and bathroom? Why is the house so small? How come Harry doesn't have a bed? This set put me to sleep for hours. What's the big deal about it?! I should've avoided getting this set. I took the 8x8 grey plates out before I abandoned this set, and used it to build an apartment, which is a much better use indeed. ",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-28T15:58:09.077Z","awesome car","The car in this set is the best car that lego has done, even out of the town sets. And if lego sold it on its own it would get a 5.
The house is okay and I like how it has Harry bedroom and the cuboard under the stairs. Unfortunately the house isn't exactly finished so the set gets a 4.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-23T04:16:43.157Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Escape from Privet Drive Review","This set is a really cool addition to your LEGO city. I like the way how LEGO did the blue car which Ron Weasley is flying. It comes with a rope in the trunk which you can use to take out the window of Harry's room and you can also put in two minifigs in this vehicle. This scene where Ron rescues Harry comes from the beginning of the second Harry Potter movie. This set is also the first and only set with Harry's uncle Vernon Dursley. The set is really fun to built and will take you some minutes. You don't get any stickers which you have to worry about and the set is very sturdy as well.<br><br>I really like the details on the front of the house but I think the inside could have got more details too. For example Harry's room doesn't really look like the room which we've seen in the movies. The coolest thing is that you can take out the window of that room. We also get a stairway with a place where you can hide some stuff in there. I really can't complain much about this set but I think this set should include more details in the inside, Harry's aunt Petunia Dursley and Harry's cousin Dudley Dursley as well. But this set is still a great addition in any LEGO city you're building.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"LegoAdventures","2011-01-21T04:21:45.1Z","Escape from Privet Drive","What a Wonderful set!. Honestly this is a Superb little remake of the Dursley's House at Number 4 Privet Drive, and I have to say although many people have said they find this set small and not up to their expectations I actually find it quite Cute and Cosy in it's on way. Released in 2002 to Coincide with the Blockbuster release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</span>, it contains 278 Pieces, 3 Mini-figures and the Dursleys Number 4 Privet Drive Homestead. This set is enthralled with little touches and features that show within each aspect of the set in which I will be revealing in my review. <br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions:</h4><h4><br></h4>The Box is 28.5cm Long, 28.5cm Tall and 5.5cm Thick. It consists of the Usual offerings you find on a Lego Box like the Red Lego Insignia. Around all the sides, back and a small border around the front of the Box is decorated in the Stone Walls around Hogwarts. There is the front Illustration of Number 4 Privet Drive and the Ford Anglia with Ron at the steering wheel trying to save Harry with Vernon running out of the Door. On the back of the Box there is 2 Alternative models of the set which you can build from LEGO.com however i don't think the Link is there anymore. There is also an image of inside the House and numerous images of other Angles of the House and the Ford Anglia. And last but not least on the side of the Box is Future References, Trademarks, Licensed Agreements and Copyrights and where the product is made, for this particular set everything from the Box, Packaging and Components are all made in Denmark. That's one thing I love about Lego is that it's top Quality European Manufactured.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the Box there is 6 Plastic Bags that are not numbered from 1-6 which makes the Build a bit more challenging, considering you have to find the various pieces you need throughout all the bags included. There is a 2 sided Pamphlet which has most of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Philosophers Stone</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Chamber of Secrets</span> sets on it and an example of how to arrange them. Then there is the 35 page Instruction Booklet, 44 Including the Illustrations at the Back.<br><br><h4>Mini-figs:</h4><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Harry James Potter:</span> Harry features his usual Messy Black Hair and Red Scar. Usual Sparkling Brave eyes and Black Circular Glasses with Raised Black eyebrows and Simple Smile. His Torso features Scarlet Red Pajamas with Quantum Purple lines going up and down the Pajamas. He also has a Violet T-Shirt under his Pajama Top and there's Black buttons down the Top. He also features his Light Grey pants. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Ronald Bilius Weasley: </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Ron features his Mopped Orange Hair, Sparkling eyes and Orange eyebrows, Freckles under his eyes and Quirky smile. His torso features a Dark Blue Sweater with various untidy or messy lines around his waist resembling his very active and Mischievous. He has a White T-Shirt underneath the Dark Blue Sweater, and last but not least Light Grey pants.<br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Vernon Dursley</span> also known as <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Uncle Vernon:</span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>Vernon features neatly combed Brownish-Orange Hair, Angry and Frustrated looking eyes with large Orange Eyebrows. He has a Very large Orange Mustache and a Grumpy looking smile. His Torso features a Dark Brown Dressing Robe with White Decorations around the neck and Chest. Underneath his Robe he has Light Sky Blue Pajamas with various White Lines. And last but not least Dark Brown Pants.<br><br><h4>Ford Anglia:</h4><br>What an exquisite Car! Full of wonderful features and Incredible detail and the Mild Cyan-Sand Blue colour is refreshing and very accurate to the Movie. You start of by Building the floor of the Car and the White rippled seats. You place a Lego piece that has a J shaped piece coming of it and that becomes the Clutch. You then start building the back lights and the Boot, which has a Rope Lego piece tucked in it with 2 Studs at the end of the rope so it can be attached to Harry's Window. You then build the Steering Wheel and next to the Steering Wheel is a Trans Red Square Stud piece, and next to that is a Trans-Neon Yellow Stud. You then place Movable doors and an Opening Boot at the back of the Car. You Build the front of the Car which is full of detail from the Chrome Silver to the Large Lights. You then Build the Glass windows, Windscreen and White roof. And last but not least the Black wheels with the Inner White pieces. <br><br><h4>No.4 Privet Drive:</h4><br>The House although it is a tad small has a Cosy and Warm feeling about it. You start of by building The 2 Floors which are attached by Hinges so you can turn the other part of the House in and out to make different Angles. You then begin by building numerous wall and window elements and attaching the Shutters to the Windows. You also add a Emerald Green Lego piece with 3 Leaves on it at the front of the House below a window. You even place a small Black Lego Tile with the Number 4 on it Next to the Door, and a small light above the number 4 sign and then you Build the Brownish-Orange Front Door. You then Build the Bedroom underneath the Staircase, which you place 1 Black Cape resembling the Hogwarts Robes and 1 Light Grey Wand in a Secret compartment that you cover with a Black plate. When you open the Door to you Left there is a Small Dark Grey table suspended above the ground by 2 Beige-Cream Lego Triangular pieces that features a Black Saucepan. Then on the Right of the Door you place a Small Brownish-Orange Brick that has 1 Geranium Red Cup/Mug and a Sand Green Cylindrical piece. In the other part of the House (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The 2 Story section</span>) on the bottom floor you build a small Brown Cylindrical Table with a Trans Red Stud, 1 Black Stud and a Grey Package with lace wrapped up on a Cream Tile piece and last but not least a Black Spider on the floor. You then place a White Pillow on the Black Plate in Harry's Bedroom underneath the Staircase which you place a Brownish-Orange Staircase over the top of his bed that leads to the 2nd story section. You build a formation of Dark Grey Roof tiles on the front of the House and then you build the second floor section. You start with a Dark Grey Desk which has a Trans-Clear Wine Glass/Goblet and an Envelope. Behind that is a Wall piece with a Window and Shutters. Next to that is 2 L shaped Black Lego Pieces with 1 Red Book and 1 Cyan Blue Book. You then finish with a Sand Green Cylindrical piece with 1 Black Stud on top. You then place Harry's White Owl <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hedwig </span>and you finish with the Roof formation on the Second story section, Which has a little compartment for you to put 2 Envelopes near the Chimney. <br><br><h4>Overall: </h4><br>Overall this set is Wonderful. Although it is small it is full of lovely features and details that are Magical, Unique and Rare. I strongly recommend this set with full confidence that you will enjoy it, It really is an Outstanding set 5/5. <br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review :)",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
