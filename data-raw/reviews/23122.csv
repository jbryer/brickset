<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are good, it starts with the MicroManager and ends with the awesome MetalBeard figure.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I bought this set because it contains a lot of pieces wich I can use for other MOC builds. The shark and the cannons are great. The huge sword is cool! The set has many joints and clips. Also the color of the pieces are a nice addition for my Lego collection.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set contains a standard Builder called &quot;Frank the Foreman&quot;, a skelleton figure, a Robot SWAT figure and ofcourse the very large MetalBeard &quot;figure&quot;.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set was nice. However I didn&#39;t enjoy the MicroManager build. Maybe that&#39;s because I bought this set for MetalBeard alone. Building MetalBeard was fun. You start with the middle section and then add the limbs and other parts of his mech.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The MicroManager does look a little off. The arms are too short and they are not detailed enough. It can be posed nicely, but I wasn&#39;t that enhousiastic when it was finished. However, MetalBeard is awesome! It is detailed, looks great and can pose very nicely, even with his peg leg.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I payed 39.99E for this set. Worth the money because I wanted to add MetalBeard to my collection.</p>

<p>For kids this set is awesome. Two mechs will be a great addition to a kids Lego collection. I can imagine they will battle with these mechs just like the movie. Parts will come off, but hey, it is a battle right?</p>

<p>For adult collectors it would be a lot more interesting to be able to buy MetalBeard as a soloset. And maybe they could provide a soloset with two different MicroManagers with some more details and more interesting parts.</p>

<p>In the end MetalBeard just looks awesome! He is posed battle ready on my desktop. This set could be 5/5. But overall I gave it a 4/5 because of the MicroManager mech.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-10-19T15:34:21.14Z","Ultimate Steampunk Robot Pirate (in disguise)","<p><strong>Set #70807 MetalBeard&#39;s Duel: </strong>Of all the LEGO Movie sets from the first wave this was a must have in my books because it features one of the most impressive looking &#39;characters&#39; from the film that just stood out as an obvious must own set/character. The set might seem like not much when taken as a whole, especially considering that the models are just oversized buildable characters. Still it&#39;s a great set and here&#39;s why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a dynamic action scene on the front of this box, MetalBeard is fighting against a Micromanager while Frank is being chased by some of Lord Business&#39; robot forces. It really grabs your attention on the shelf and gives you a strong desire to pick up this beauty. The back shows off the small number of features the builds in this set offers, which isn&#39;t much.</p>

<p>One manual for this set, which is great. It breaks the build up by the three numbered bags found in the set and shows off all the same advert pages as found in other sets. Again there is a distinct lack of figure checklists in this Theme, I haven&#39;t gotten any of the second wave yet so I don&#39;t know if they included that as a feature in the summer wave. However I have to admit for such a huge push as this Theme got in advertising and marketing and such I would have expected them to at least include a figure checklist.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You&#39;ll find a load of parts in this set, and many of them are fairly standard. However there are a load of fun and useful parts in this set, there&#39;s MetalBeard&#39;s metal beard, steering wheel, clockwork key, anchor, cutlass blade, cannons and so much more found here that can be useful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set features nothing but buildable figures and mini-figures, technically. Since I consider the Micromanagers to be buildable characters instead of actual vehicles or other types of models, however as this set only has this we shall still save the models to be discussed later.</p>

<p>Robo-SWAT: not much to say new about this figure, his print details are all the same as before as well as his accessory. The only thing unique to him seems to be his facial print, a great little army builder character to add to your growing army of Robo-SWATs.</p>

<p>Skeletron: This figure is just your basic skeleton, with droid arms instead of the older floppy arm design, the only thing different here is the head&#39;s facial print and the choice in colours. He&#39;s all grey meaning he is a robot skeleton and part of Lord Business&#39; army of robot beings. I suspect he&#39;s from Middle Zealand or at least meant to originate from that area of the LEGO Movie world&#39;s many realms. I love his sinister looking facial print, he&#39;d fit in quite nicely with the Fantasy Era&#39;s skeleton warriors.</p>

<p>Frank the Foreman: Emmet&#39;s boss on the construction site and the only normal character in this set, he has a great construction themed print matching Emmet&#39;s&nbsp;although his chest detailing is much different and includes some manly chest hair. He&#39;s got a full print of facial hair as well and some great pant details with a pair of pockets some silver stripes on his knees and a curious looking belt design. Great looking minifig.</p>

<p>MetalBeard: We&#39;ll discuss him in detail during the model section of the review, however I have to mention his facial print here as he does have an ordinary minifigure head. All that&#39;s left of him, he&#39;s got a great looking metal eyepatch&nbsp; and a gold tooth visible in his grim, teeth bearing expression. We&#39;ve seen a few new sets now coming out in 2015, and I think rumours exist of a second series of minifigures, if I&#39;m not mistaken. Hopefully if they do happen one of them will be MetalBeard before his accident, because that would be awesome to see him before his rebuilding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>With three numbered bags the builds for this set are broken up between them. The Micromanager is all in bag #1 and shares superficial similarities to an AT-ST walker in the way the legs are designed. The rest is purely unique and involves a lot of black and grey pieces with transparent red studs for the numerous eyes. Honestly there isn&#39;t much to this build although I do think it has some fun elements as you&#39;re basically turning a cube shape into a robot walker.</p>

<p>Bag #2 builds MetalBeard&#39;s body and legs, which is a very fun build. Everything is asymmetrical and designed to look as steampunk as you can get. The fun part is that both legs are not identical, even when he could build anything he wanted for a new body he still chose to give himself a peg leg. And that build is just pure fun. The torso has some clever steps too especially how you give him a waist swivel.</p>

<p>Bag #3 is just the arms, the sword and a few minor upper body accessories. Not much to it honestly, though the arms are fun to build, especially the cannon firing arm and the final touches truly evoke a steampunk era pirate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This Micromanager has a spot inside to store the Robo-SWAT, almost like a pilot&#39;s area, it features two fold out flick-fire missile launchers and some grasping arms to hold minifigures. Overall a fun design and unique to this set, for the upper cube section, the legs are built identically to the ones in Rescue Reinforcements.</p>

<p>MetalBeard is the true gem of the set as far as builds go, he&#39;s a perfect blend of Pirate, Steampunk Designed Mecha and Quirky LEGO Movie character. The fact that he has a live shark on&nbsp;one hand just seems to work, no matter how zany it comes off as. The joints all work nicely and you can strike some impressive poses with this guy, as long as you balance him properly on the peg leg. He has a firing cannon arm and a sword, and he looks almost 100% accurate to his on-screen counterpart. (I believe there are some differences.)</p>

<p>MetalBeard alone is just worth the price for this set, though I do think 45$ CND is a bit on the high side. Considering the number of pieces included.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Buy this set, even if you aren&#39;t a fan of the movie, just buy it. The Minifigures aren&#39;t much in all honesty, and the Micromanager is just there as a foil for MetalBeard to duel however MetalBeard alone is a must own LEGO item. This is the first Steampunk Mecha design ever incorporated into LEGO and fans of that industrialized style will just love the model for MetalBeard in this set. The off the wall nature of this crazy build just adds to the appeal and that unique metal beard piece is great. I highly recommend this set to all builders, be they Master or Novice, there&#39;s a world of fun to be had in this set, and loads of great display options for a MetalBeard in LEGO World kind of thing. I can just imagine him crossing over into Ninjago, Chima, Star Wars or even Monster Fighters, he can fit in anywhere and look awesome and is just fun to play with to boot.</p>

"brickman3","2014-11-01T19:59:09.547Z","Pretty cool, me harties!","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box showed the Micro Manager in battle with MetalBeard, which is pretty much what the set is about. The instructions were simple and easy to read. A</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There were about 400 pieces in this set, each being unique. The shark and falcon pieces are cool, and I like seeing the Skeletron&#39;s parts. A+</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigures are super cool. So are the figures. The set (as you should know by looking at the box), comes with 3 Minifigures and 2 figures: Skeletron, Frank the Foreman, Robo SWAT, Micro Manager (one of the many versions!), and MetalBeard.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Skeletron is pretty cool. He comes as an actual skeleton-like figure, and he has screws in his mouth. He may look weird, but he is only following Lord Business&#39; orders. He has 6 pieces to make him, so he takes a bit longer to build than Frank or Robo SWAT.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next up is Frank the Foreman. He is just an average Lego construction worker, except that he is trying to live. Poor guy! He takes 4 pieces, so yeah, pretty average.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The final Minifigure is the Robo SWAT. He is a basic minion of Lord Business, and this guy MEANS business! He comes with a helmet and blaster, so I guess that he is a combat man. He comes as 6 pieces, so he is like the Skeletron, only stronger!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now for the Micro Manager. This guy is one of my favorites. He comes with grabbing claws (to put Frank in), tall legs, a hatch in his head (for the Skeletron to go, just in case manual mode is needed), and flick missiles! Not basic at all! I&#39;m not sure how many pieces he has, but based on the amount of pieces in the set, I will guess 150 or so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least (by a long shot!), MetalBeard! This salty pup is boss! He has features such as the arm cannon, shark arm, falcon perch, treasure chest heart, giant sword, and of course, the metal beard! Also, he only comes in one other set (MetalBeard&#39;s Sea Cow, set 70810-1), so he is pretty rare.The only thing about him to be carful with is his waist. I will talk about that later.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So basically, A++ on this part!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about 45 minutes to build this.&nbsp;That isn&#39;t bad for me, but it wasn&#39;t that challenging. So for all of you beginners out there, this is a good set for you! A+</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is cool, except for one thing- MetalBeard kept falling apart! That&#39;s right, breaking! Whenever I would use him, his top part would break from the waist (not me, honest!), and it would take me forever to make him right again! C+</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion is good about this set. Try it for yourself!</p>
