"stevbrix","2014-04-19T02:00:45.923Z","See you later, alligator.","<p>It took me about a month to finally get this set, and I completely understand why. Let me just say that I consider this the best liscensed set under $100 since late 2012&#39;s 79003 An Unexpected Gathering. That should be enough.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>For a set based on a movie promoting the use of creativity and not using instructions, I was slightly surprised that there were 2 books. They had typical instruction booklet material, although there was an error in the piece inventory section, saying that there were two string pieces when there was only one.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is a great set when it comes to pieces. There are many new ones, and that&#39;s always a good thing. Although some are pretty much useless except for their intended purpose, such as Lord Business&#39;s headdress, armor, and legs. But that&#39;s about it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Emmet is pretty much the same as he is in every other set he&#39;s in, with the Piece of Resistance, the double-sided head and what not.</p>

<p>Vitruvius has unique hair and beard pieces, neutral and sad faces, a sparkly light blue cape, and a tie-dye t-shirt, jeans, and crocs printed on his robes.</p>

<p>Lord Business comes with a headdress and cape meant to look like a necktie, as well as his &quot;big boy boots,&quot; about 11 bricks high. The top three bricks are attatched to the legs, and there is a separate pair, as well as his hair, for him to become President Business.</p>

<p>Biznis Kitty is the same as in the Cloud Cuckoo Palace, but with glasses, a tie, and mathematical symbols printed on her.</p>

<p>El Macho Wrestler is the only minifigure with only one face. He is a stereotypical Mexican wrestler, like the Series 1 minifigure, but with no blue.</p>

<p>Ma Cop and Pa Cop have simple printing on their torsos, and come with clear versions of the plates from the Toy Story army men, representing super glue.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For me, the build took about an hour, but it differs for everyone. Bag 1 contains Emmet, Lord/President Business, the table, and the conference room. Bag 2 has El Macho Wrestler, Biznis Kitty, and the think tanks. Bag 3 has Ma Cop, Pa Cop and the TAKOS (with a silent s). Bag 4 has Vitruvius and the window. Bag 5 has the Kragle, studio, couch, camera, and battery.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model isn&#39;t the most accurate to the movie, but you can&#39;t really make something from this movie that&#39;s 100% accurate. Play features include popping the TAKOS out of a wall and knocking something out of the window.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is probably the 3rd best set of 2014 so far, behind the Parisian Restaurant and the Simpsons house. The set&#39;s pros include great minifigures, lots of playability, and a great price-to-piece ratio. Cons, however, are, well, non-existent in this case. So I hope this was helpful in any way.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art is great and was the main reason why I bought it in the first place. I wanted it basically because of the President Business character. I had just seen the movie and said to myself, &quot;I have to have that!&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of the instructions I had a hard time with figuring out what to do when constructing the &quot;Cragle&quot; portion. I got the doors to open and shut but they were uneven. Tried to rebuild it but got frustrated and decided to try it again another day. Many parts of the set just don&#39;t seem to fit together naturally. The instructions are clear, but for someone new to Lego its rather difficult to figure out. This was my first &quot;big&quot; set and it was a big jump from smaller sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are all very small and hard to see without my glasses. My biggest issue was the transparent red 2 notch bricks. I kept getting them confused with the red grates. Also it was disappointing that the &quot;Cragle&quot; required a decal. So many super small parts are vital to the build so it gets a little tiring sorting through them. This set requires a certain level of experience with Legos to understand how it all fits together.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigures&nbsp;are wonderful! I love the fact that I actually have a President Business. Vitruvius&nbsp;is pretty cool looking. Emmet, Unikitty, and the two ma &amp; pa cops are a great addition. I don&#39;t quite remember the wrestler from the movie though.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building President Business and 3/4 of the set was great. The upper portion that houses the &quot;Cragle&quot; is where I got totally lost.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I still haven&#39;t completed it, used the pieces to build something kind of similar. I suppose someday I&#39;ll complete the model when I get used to how builds work. I find that downloading instructions on my iPad help a lot because I can zoom in.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a set for people who know how to deal with the medium to giant Lego sets. If you&#39;re new and have just dabbled with some small sets, expect to be scratching you head a lot.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-07-30T19:54:30.5Z","Business, Buisness, Business","<p><strong>Set #70809 Lord Business&#39; Evil Lair: </strong>It&#39;s that time again, another milestone review for Brickset, technically speaking, this will be my 575th review on Brickset and it was very difficult to choose which set to represent such a milestone. So here&#39;s my first review for the LEGO Movie Theme, which I haven&#39;t tackled yet.</p>

<p>When LEGO first announced this film I was shocked, and I knew it was going to be fun. Once they started showing off the sets I knew that there would be some great builds to offer and this is awesome, though a bit different from typical LEGO sets or bases of LEGO villains.</p>

<p>Let us discuss in-depth the merit of this set and whether or not it&#39;s a set you&#39;ll want to own.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The LEGO Movie boxes are impressively designed, and they really do their best to attract your attention on the shelf. I was quite in love with these designs because of how colourful, how attractive and how functional they are. They show off the contents of the set brilliantly and capture scenes from the film making you want to play out the fun you saw on screen with your LEGO kits. They also invoke the quirky nature of the film to a T and I just like how fun they are.</p>

<p>The instructions are also very well designed and works great, I&#39;m very pleased at what LEGO did here, they&#39;ve taken their customary easy to follow build instructions and wrapped them in a great package that shares the wonderful design of the boxes. There are two manuals in this set, and five numbered bags.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are so many parts in this set that are unique, fun, useful for MOCs or just plain unusual that listing them all isn&#39;t something I&#39;m going to even try. However I will say this, if you&#39;re a fan of MOCs you&#39;re going to find a lot of useful pieces here and clever builders will master new techniques of incorporating these pieces into their MOCs, especially the Big Boy Pants and the Kragle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set features a load of characters from the film, it is the only way to collect some of them also. We&#39;ll start with the main protagonist and move on from there to discuss each one.</p>

<p>Emmet: The Chosen One himself, or the Prophesied One, or whatever you want to call him. (Yes of course he&#39;s The Special.)&nbsp;He&#39;s found in a very large number of this Theme&#39;s sets and many of them share the exact same torso print. The level of detail in the prints of all the Mini-Figures in this Theme is on par with the CMF Themes. This Theme has the most Mini-Figures with double-sided torsos, head prints and leg printing as every set seems to almost feature the entire Mini-Figure line up with this printing. Emmet&#39;s hair is also a nice new piece with a bit of a cowlick that is so fun and could be a great new piece.</p>

<p>He also has the Piece of Resistance strapped to his back, a great new piece introduced by LEGO that sits on a back bracket and can attach to a LEGO Brick in three different spots. It&#39;s just a great new piece that works wonderfully for what it is, considering it does have to represent the macguffin of the movie it isn&#39;t exactly what the piece looked like in the movie, but it works.</p>

<p>Vitruvius: This Mini-Figure can be found in this set and the Sea Cow, the only two ways to get it and of the two this is the cheapest. This version has a staff built out of pieces that is meant to represent the mostly chewed sucker that he uses after the prologue of the movie. He&#39;s got a great hairpiece, the first blind facial print and a nice new style of cape in a shimmery looking material. He&#39;s a great figure on his own and just well worth tracking down if you can&#39;t afford the expensive sets, plus he&#39;s Morgan Freeman in LEGO form, how can you not want a little Morgan Freeman in your LEGO collection?</p>

<p>Pa Cop: Ah, what&#39;s a LEGO set without police officers? Even in the LEGO Movie line you find classic looking police in the sets, although to be fair they are named characters and not just generic&nbsp;figures. Pa Cop is Bad Cop&#39;s father, he&#39;s a nice looking figure with your typical police uniform. He&#39;s got a simpler print compared to the other figures in the set, with only a single-sided torso print and a double-sided head. He comes with a pair of handcuffs, and Harry Potter&#39;s hairpiece in light grey.</p>

<p>The best accessory for this Mini-Figure is the clear stand, first found with LEGO Toy Story&#39;s army men, this piece is done here in transparent plastics used to represent the Kragle effect on him.</p>

<p>Ma Cop: Bad Cop&#39;s mother is equally impressive and equally welcome as an additional character in this set. Her torso is also a single-sided print and she&#39;s using a hairpiece first introduced in the CMF line. She also has a double-sided head print, which brings the count up to four so far, every figure in this set has double-sided heads except one. She&#39;s carrying an ordinary megaphone and has the clear stand accessory also.</p>

<p>El Macho Wrestler: One of the many Master Builders, El Macho Wrestler is a great looking figure with a lot of detail in his print. He&#39;s got a double-sided torso showing off his costume and bare muscled chest/back, he&#39;s got leg printing and his red masked head is awesome. He has no accessories, but does come with a white&nbsp;cape.</p>

<p>President/Lord Business: Two in one Mini-Figures aren&#39;t common, here we have President Business with his ordinary plain looking business suit, a single-sided torso print and plain grey legs. He doesn&#39;t have any accessories because he includes the pieces of Lord Business to make him into a really tall, really sinister looking figure. He&#39;s got a nice looking shoulder piece that slides over his torso giving him some black armour with a red tie print, he&#39;s got that funky looking almost Galactus-like helmet with the two coffee cup horns and he&#39;s got his big boy pants. These are a separate set of legs with permanently attached sloped pieces so you can add on the bricks used in making the huge stomping boots he wears.</p>

<p>Biznis Kitty: Not a Mini-Figure, but an awesome brick-built character who&#39;s cute, cuddly and all around fun. Biznis Kitty is just Unikitty with a poorly and hastily drawn on buisness disguise. What sells it for me is the cute open mouthed expression and the goofy looking drawn on glasses. This is the only way to get this version of Unikitty, so if you want her you&#39;ll have to bricklink her or buy the set.</p>

<p>Overall this set includes a great set of characters, the only dullard in the set is Emmet and that&#39;s only because, as the Special, he&#39;s in so many sets with that exact same print there isn&#39;t much going for him when you collect the entire Theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Each numbered bag builds one section of the model, and every aspect of the build is interesting if a bit unfortunately brisk, some steps are faster than others from what I can recall and even though there are 738 pieces in the set there&#39;s nothing too tricky about the build for the recommended age groups. Certain younger builders may want to ask for help in placing the stickers or working on the large Kragle dispenser section with the opening gate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model for this set captures Lord Business&#39; Evil Lair quite nicely, it has the meeting area (much smaller than what was shown on screen of course), the think tank (only good for capturing two Master Builders), the Kragle area which might be both the trophy room and the window where Emmet almost met with an unfortunate end, and the filming studio. (Though that last one is just a camera, couch and bit of lighting so there isn&#39;t much there.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s got a lot of play value, unfortunately as a display piece I find it a bit difficult to fit nicely on the shelf, mostly because of the methods used in the build with clips to push it into an angled looking building. I do find it to be pretty decent though I kind of wish that LEGO would have made a different decision when designing it to incorporate one section of the lair and stick with it. The studio should have been a separate set honestly, because it&#39;s just such a slapshod addition almost as an afterthought. I think a few extra Think Tank sections would have benefited more the model compared to the couch and the bit of scaffolding/lighting for the television studio.</p>

<p>I do love the entire section with the Kragle though, this is the biggest reason for buying the set. It has a great look to it with the columns from Atlantis and a fully functioning opening gate with spray/robotic arm that is hooked up to the Kragle, and a balcony section with red curtains and the special battery build off to one side controlling the horrible machine. I would have preferred just this as the main build with possibly a separate, larger think tank that could hold six mini-figures honestly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I find this set to be pretty impressive, I also think it&#39;s worth picking up because of the Mini-Figures and all of the aspects that LEGO tried to capture of the evil lair. It&#39;s really a great looking set, that is only bogged down by trying to feature much to many areas of the massive set pieces from the film in one decently priced set.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend the set and can&#39;t wait to discuss some of the better offerings from this Theme when time permits.</p>

"Cheshire_axolotl","2014-07-24T11:16:23.36Z","Doesn't Stand Alone Well","<p>Somehow I&rsquo;d contrived to accidentally/intentionally go out and watch the Lego Movie three times during the cinema run, on blu-ray release that figure bumped up by another round of three&hellip; And yet, I&rsquo;ve collected very few of the associated sets.</p>

<p>Prior to this, my only Lego Movie set was 70803 Cloud Cuckoo Palace and a dozen or so CMFs. One, I was in the process of moving and space was an issue at the other end. Two, moving is an expensive business and this just didn&rsquo;t look worth the RRP&hellip; Offer it to me at 40% off though and I&rsquo;m powerless to stop myself!</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s All There (Scene-wise)</strong></p>

<p>Lord Business&rsquo; Tower is, as we all know, ridiculously big. The designers have done a great job to capture its summary nicely condensed into a set size-comparable with 9473 The Mines of Moria. It pops apart into three sections when built, moving left to right: &lsquo;Where are My Pants?&rsquo; Film Set; Ground floor &lsquo;Business Meeting&rsquo; with Think Tank upstairs; The Kragle, battery and &lsquo;window leap&rsquo;. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Flimsy and frustrating!</strong></p>

<p>I built this several months ago, but I still (bitterly) remember how frustrating some aspects of the build were. Putting together the lower half of the<strong> Kragle Section</strong>, it kept popping apart in my hands. I imagine if you have a table and no interruptions (animals, door, phone, argh!), this might be less of an issue.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;fun&rsquo; black doors in the lower half that hide the glue-spraying nozzle proved to be a major headache. They kept sticking and didn&rsquo;t pull back right when I went to tuck it away again. I tried to rebuild it, work out what went wrong, but then had an issue with one of the doors not aligning&hellip; How, how?! &hellip; My doors are now perfectly flush, they open smoothly, but they still won&rsquo;t close properly with the play mechanism and need to be poked shut. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The filming suite for &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s My Pants?&rsquo;</strong> are two girders joined to the main set by clipping downwards onto a connector peg (note, it cannot freestand unless you get another girder and add a baseplate for stability). On the one hand, this is great to pop free if you need to move it and allows you to attach it at whatever angle (inwards to mirror the kragle half, or flush with the think tank, etc) and the attached stage lights are wonderful. On the other hand though, whilst gently dusting, it somehow managed to &lsquo;explode&rsquo; off the set and took out the hefty gate portion of the neighbouring 9468 Vampyre Castle&hellip; I can only think it&rsquo;s possessed with some crazed fighting spirit or thought Lego-set-dominoes would be a lark. You want to make sure it&rsquo;s very VERY firmly clipped in place, because for such a light segment it really does cause an alarming amount of damage if it goes flying!</p>

<p>In addition to this, my poor set had an unfortunate run in with a dog tail. The film set part got catapulted across the room, the kragle bit fell to pieces&hellip; But the middle think tank/business meeting portion did prove itself to be awesomely sturdy, completely unharmed by the misadventure due to a&nbsp;supporting pair of technic beams (*4495935*) hidden in the rear.</p>

<p><strong>Business Suite and Think Tank</strong></p>

<p>This is, by far, my favourite bit of the set. It&rsquo;s the <em>absolute business</em> with two think tank pods (with the announcement of a Green Lantern set due Jan 2015, we can finally have superman and his annoying neighbour! Does anyone have some Kryptonite?). With a bit of ingenuity, it would certainly be possible to tack on another two pods if you wished to modify it a little larger, the solid build is super sturdy with those technic beams (and proven quite resistant to wagging dogs!)</p>

<p>Possibly because I&rsquo;m an adult (even if my inner child likes to crawl out occasionally), the business conference is actually the bit I love most. The loose business table goes together using build methods I&rsquo;d never considered, and the four attached chairs <strong>SWIVEL ABOUT</strong>. With a minifigure sat in them, this spinning is limited by the rim of the table, but you can still specifically angle them to get the look you want and the table stops them spinning out of place. Sometimes it&rsquo;s nice to clear the office and pose a drone spinning bored in his chair.</p>

<p>Biznis Kitty is one of the characters included in the set (She&rsquo;s quite dashing with her&nbsp;marker-pen glasses and tie, plus the dollar, euro and percentage, etc. marks), who looks very happy on the table top. If you combine this with the Movie CMF collection, you can really fill this out: Velma Staplebot is taking minutes; Lord Business is clutching his octan-mug of coffee; Taco Tuesday guy just fits with his hat on the plates either side of the business projections board (but only just, mind!) and I&rsquo;ve nicked Executron from Cuckoo Palace&hellip; I&rsquo;m gutted I haven&rsquo;t got a Bruce Wayne to complete the scene, but Unikitty can just keep yelling &lsquo;business business numbers&rsquo; to her audience.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Aside from the above described shenanigans, there is good playability elsewhere in this set (that would appeal to the kids). Pop those pesky black doors and you can freeze the enclosed Ma and Pa Cop (they even have clear &lsquo;glued&rsquo; plastic bases, as seen previously in green for the Toy Story soldiers). But again, you&rsquo;re going to want to supplement here with a Bad Cop.</p>

<p>The filming scene itself only has the set, couch and a camera, but you can complete the look with the CMF Where&rsquo;s my Pants Guy. If you desperately want to replicate the scene then Sharon Shoehorn, his &lsquo;honey&rsquo;, can be found in 70806 Castle Cavalry, but frankly you can pop anything in there. I currently have Mandarin (Marvel Superheroes) sat in the hot seat sharing a banana with a monkey &ndash; because why not?</p>

<p>In addition to this, there&rsquo;s the &lsquo;broken window&rsquo; and battery. The battery section drives me crazy, it keeps spontaneously falling apart (the top is connected with just one stud, which it needs so it will separate during a window fall, but Grrr), and I imagine this will be a problem in play. It does mean if you&rsquo;re in countdown to self-destruct, Emmet can spare himself a leap as the power might just die with him half-heartedly wiggling. I&rsquo;m not too sure why they put in the red curtains here either, except perhaps to highlight it&rsquo;s definitely supposed to be a window. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lovely section enclosed with this set, totalling six (Biznis Kitty I&rsquo;m classing as a character build as she isn&rsquo;t a tradition minifig, but her detailing is excellent). Ma and Pa cop (as mentioned); Lord Business; ANOTHER EMMET!; Vitruvius; El Macho Wrestler and Lord Business with his &lsquo;big boy shoes&rsquo;, headgear and long cape. The face prints are wonderful, really giving a vibe to each character.</p>

<p><strong>Ma Cop</strong> has a pair of pink half-moon glasses, perched at the end of her nose as they&rsquo;re printed just below her eyes. Apparently at her age she still goes a bit heavy on the very-very-red lipstick, but each to their own. Her grey hair in a bun gives her a no-nonsense feel, and you get a vibe she was a great cop in her day. Full marks for character!</p>

<p><strong>Pa Cop</strong> reminds me of Commissioner Gordon (Batman), who I sadly don&rsquo;t have in Lego, so that&rsquo;s rather bumped him up in the minifigure ranks. He has very thick glasses, which makes me think he probably loses them from time to time, making Ma Cop have to push her own further up her nose and point out they&rsquo;re already in his hand/on his face/next to him on the table, etc.</p>

<p><strong>Emmet</strong>&hellip; He&rsquo;s the hero of the movie, it&rsquo;s the Lone Ranger all over again, where you end up with a half dozen duplicates. With still only a handful of movie sets, I already have an identical one in 70800 Getaway Glider. I do wish large sets would pass on repeating such readily available characters (he&rsquo;s included identical in five different sets), but then who would you attach to the battery? I can also imagine a lot of children would only get access to this for Christmas and birthdays, and you get almost the whole team in one set to play with&hellip; But not Wyldstyle, which trashes that argument somewhat. It makes sense to team this up with 70801 Melting Room (the same Emmet, and also a Wyldstyle &ndash; though with her hood up), then we *could* have had something a little more unique instead to help justify that RRP.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Vitruvius</strong>, before the 70810 Sea Cow came along, was an exclusive to this set. He fits his movie counterpart well and the pieces used for his staff are a good interpretation (even if newer and shinier). I do wish we&rsquo;d had the parts to give him a zimmer frame in the set, but that&rsquo;s easily remedied yourself.</p>

<p><strong>El Macho Wrestler</strong> is brilliant. I&rsquo;ve missed out on his blue CMF Series 1 buddy, so I can&rsquo;t personally compare, but they should look cracking together in the ring. Even with his cape, he fits nicely in a think tank pod, and there&rsquo;s something about that cocky expression that makes me smile.</p>

<p>And, last but not least, <strong>Lord Business</strong>&hellip; We&rsquo;ve been able to get him much cheaper through the CMF series, but there&rsquo;s something to be said about his giant cape, that hat/helmet and of course the big boy shoes. His head is also two sided, so you can have the visor of his headgear down. I won&rsquo;t lie, the first thing I did was swap mine out of the set for the CMF, simply because this &lsquo;epic&rsquo; version of Lord Business teams beautifully with the young Vitruvius minifig enclosed with (my back&nbsp;then pre-ordered) &lsquo;Everything is Awesome&rsquo; Edition of the movie release (which I had to import, because the UK is apparently unloved when it comes such shiny shinies!). For re-creating the prologue of the film, or just displaying them on a bookshelf together as I currently am, you can&rsquo;t go wrong there.</p>

<p><strong>Overall: I Cannot Stand Alone</strong></p>

<p>I have to say, despite some real bugbears with construction and flimsiness of some areas, the set is quite playful. It cleverly evokes the rather vast array of locations within the tower into one set, so children can recreate the movie for themselves in one concentrated play zone and not swallow up an entire floor-space. If you&rsquo;re only going for one Lego Movie item though, this does feel incomplete if you&rsquo;re not going to supplement in at least the Movie CMF Where&rsquo;s My Pants guy. There&rsquo;s another duplicate Emmet as I *might* have mentioned and no Wyldstyle in sight. I&rsquo;m consoling myself that all these Emmets could be playfully used in&hellip; Maybe an MOC convention?</p>

<p>The price though, to me, is a problem. It&rsquo;s a bit costly for what really does need other things added to it. At 40% off, I felt comfortable. If I paid full RRP, I would have resented the set somewhat. I already collect the various CMF characters, but if I didn&rsquo;t, that would be an extra cost factor to make the most of the set. You can&rsquo;t really roleplay the Movie Theme without Wyldstyle, and the western CMF version wouldn&rsquo;t fit, so you&rsquo;ll need to pick up one of the cheap sets for her&hellip; From a display point of view though, this does look tasty if you have all the right characters within your collection, and a great focal point to herd the micromanagers about.</p>

<p>This said, despite all that, I&rsquo;m super attached to the Ma and Pa Cop minifigures. I&rsquo;ve got a lot of enjoyment, still am, out of that business suite section. I also know this will escalate once I get a green lantern into my collection (sorry superman!)&hellip; But it doesn&rsquo;t rank in my top hundred, and would probably struggle to place in the top two hundred too.</p>
