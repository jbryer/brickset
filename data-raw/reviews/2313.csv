You get Dumbledore and alot of unique pieces and suprises as you build this set. This is a fun set to build and play around with after its complete. I highly recommend this set even at a retail cost of around $49.99 in USA.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I wish it had another Fawkes and a desk instead of just a table. Still a little crowded, and why doesn't McGonagall have any legs?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"lukehankenobi","2010-06-17T15:36:09Z","A great Harry Potter set!","Dumbledore's Office is one of my favorite Harry Potter sets. Great set, cool pieces and mini-figures, lovely to build which I have done 3 times, and it is increasing in value all the time. I love the way it opens up at the back to reveal the inside. It has a secret entrance at the front with some nice shiny's",FALSE,5,5,5,3,4
"chaucey","2010-08-17T17:19:30.53Z","Best Harry Potter Set.","<p>What a great set.&nbsp; I'm collecting my Lego retrospectively, and I'm so pleased that this is the set I've bought first from all the Harry Potter releases.&nbsp; If you're only getting one HP set, then this is the one to get. (P)</p>
<p>It is a nice big satisfying build and looks great all set up. It has playability with lots of moving parts (swivelling door, swinging door, secret hiding place under table, spinning sections...) and with three great minifigures. (P)</p>
<p>I like how the set opens up wider and then closes shut tidily again.&nbsp; The instructions have a few other suggestions of builds that can be done with the pieces which is a nice touch.&nbsp; Loved the sorting hat but perhaps they could have also included Fawkes. (P)</p>
<p>One small complaint I have is that the book piece doesn't attach anywhere and falls off if put in the spot the instructions recommend.&nbsp; The instructions didn't include a parts list and in some steps I realised I'd missed something earlier and had to backtrack a little, but I am a lego beginner. (P)</p>
<p>Great set, I'm sure everyone would enjoy it!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"ibamomx5","2011-03-26T13:41:11.65Z","A have to have set!","<p>This is one of the best of the old HP sets. &nbsp;As of yet, it has not been reproduced, so it is truly a one of a kind, and one every HP Lego fan has to have!</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 Large completed size, that closes in to a more compact size</li><li>Pro 2 Great playability with a rotating wall, escape hatch, a spiral staircase you can spin, a moving ""pensive"", and several moving hidden compartments.</li><li>Pro 3 A very good depiction of the magical, mystical feel of Dumbledore's office</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 Instructions are difficult to follow in places; especially when pieces were to be placed behind other bricks unseen. &nbsp;I had to backtrack a few times to pick up on building things that I missed.</li><li>Con 2 &nbsp;Prof. McGonagal has no glasses</li><li>Con 3 space is very tight making it difficult get through the escape hatch</li><li>con 4 would have liked to have seen Fawkes. &nbsp;(I may paint an extra Hedwig red?)</li></ul>
<p>Although there are a few ""flaws"" with this set, overall I still think it is amazing, and one of my favorites!</p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-05T04:49:38.453Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Dumbledore's Office Review","This is a set which I got for Christmas a long time ago. It was a lot of fun to build that model and I didn't have to complain about stickers. This set comes with a basic LEGO Harry Potter minifig with yellow skin, the headteacher Albus Dumbledore who comes with a purple suit, a gray beard and gray hair. The other figure we get is Minerva McGonagall. It was the only Harry Potter set which comes with a McGonagall minifig before LEGO rereleased the hogwarts castle in 2010.<br><br>The whole set has lot's of play features. You can open the wall and you can see a box which sviwels and a shelf where you can put some stuff in there. On the back you can see a secret entrance and there's a room where you can see a sviwel stairway. On the first floor you can see the office of Albus Dumbledore. We get a desk and a sviwel chair. We also get a swivel shelf. On the top of the shelf you can see a translucent purple plate which you can turn with some gears on the back of the building. There're also two walls on each side which you can sviwel. There's also a balcony on the top but there's no ladder so I don't know how the minifigs get on the balcony. It's a very fun set to have. This set could have had better details from the movies and I also wish that this set would have come with the phenix as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great model and I would highly recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"woodall_aidan","2011-05-17T18:35:47.87Z","One of the awesome rare sets I own","This set is one of the best sets ever. It is definitely worth more than $50 dollars, based on the...everything of the set. It has Harry, Dumbledore (yellow) and the only yellow Mcgonagall. It also includes multiple rare pieces, such as the clear, purple thing that spins. It also comes with a red potions book, a potions shelf, dragon parts, and much, much more. It easily gets a stunning, stunning 5/5<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"HarleyMeenen","2016-08-23T16:12:26.747Z","Decent Set for Display over Play","<p>This set is very cool-looking, with fold-up sections, a spiral staircase, and special features such as a hidden door for sneaking out. I was happy with the minifigures, which include Dumbledore, McGonagall, and of course Harry, with the yellow faces rather than the new pale ones.</p>

<p>Overall, though, this set is far better for putting on display than any actual use. The office is cramped, even with the sections folded open, so there is not much room for movement, and the back door is in fact nearly inaccessible.</p>

<p>The build also has some issues. The instructions do not have the typical section listing which parts are used in each step. Instead, each step merely shows the new picture with no indication of what has been added, leaving it entirely to the builder to notice what is different. This can be difficult in some steps when many parts have been added in different sections. Because of that, I might be hesitant to suggest this set for younger kids or inexperienced builders.</p>

<p>I would absolutely recommend this set for collectors and fans of the older sets. For casual builders or those looking for playability, I would probably suggest looking to more recent sets, which in many ways improved upon the Hogwarts builds.</p>
