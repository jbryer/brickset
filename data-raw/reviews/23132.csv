The three of these sets were released during Bricktober of 2013 and they were a bit of a disappointment to many fans because they didn&rsquo;t capture the same aesthetic as those that had come before. What does that mean? Basically these are minifigure packs that take random pieces, slap them together and call it a day. They aren&rsquo;t the same as the true vintage collections that LEGO gave us prior to this and it shows.</p>

<p>But don&rsquo;t just take my word for it, here are my detailed thoughts and opinions on Bricktober 2013&rsquo;s exclusive offerings for the first three months.</p>

<p>Box</p>

<p>The packaging is actually quite nice for these sets; showing off the figures in a protective plastic slip case while the yellow box and black insert tray are semi-standard for minifigure collections of this type. It&rsquo;s a nice design, the yellow brick looking box is pretty interesting and the exclusive tag on the corner is a nice font and has purple colouring to draw your eyes to it.</p>

<p>Honestly though it&rsquo;s difficult to say much about the box, I love the way it shows off the minifigures and the way the black tray is designed to custom fit the figures. If you wanted you could keep these sealed in the package and the value would be much higher, unfortunately the contents can&rsquo;t be enjoyed that way. Though they would look impressive.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Each set included 5 minifigures and we&rsquo;ll discuss each one in a moment, unfortunately there are a few things to say overall first off. These minifigures do not have official names listed underneath them, like the vintage minifigure collections made with true vintage designs and prints in mind. These are just generic (mostly City) minifigures.</p>

<p>For volume 1 you get the following minifigures:</p>

<p>City Robber: This guy is made up of the top half of a typical robber from the City Theme, for some reason his legs seem to break up the print of the torso, assuming that this torso originally came with leg printing. He&rsquo;s fairly generic and works alright, however personally I would have preferred an old fashioned Town Crook that was actually a vintage character. This guy is just bland, and has no accessories, the legs are more like Batman&rsquo;s legs, with a plain black belt and dark grey legs.</p>

<p>City Cop: Now this minifigure is a much better character, he has no name of course, but his legs and torso actually match without any obvious print issues. He has a double-sided torso city police torso with a tie and badge, plain black legs and a brown hair piece. His facial print is standard of the cops, he&rsquo;s wearing shades and smiling. He&rsquo;d make a great addition to any City Police Station or set.</p>

<p>City Female: A generic looking minifigure with some nice piece use, she has a double-sided orange top with a flower pinned to it which is often re-used on LEGO children minifigures. (Because while the back print clearly indicates this is a female top which is mostly backless, there are no telltale curves.) She has plain orange legs, matching the top as if it were a dress or something, and she&rsquo;s using the hairpiece first used on CMF Cheerleaders in brown.</p>

<p>Her facial print is decent and looks good, the one issue is that for some reason the hair is very loose on her head. It tends to move around more easily on the stud and isn&rsquo;t as secure as it should, perhaps due to the type of ABS used in its construction. It is so loose that it enjoys popping off with very little provocation.</p>

<p>Female Doctor: I love this minifigure from the top, but her legs&hellip; Ugh. Ok this doctor is a woman, her top is probably from male minifigures since there are no curves on the print, which doesn&rsquo;t really matter too much because the print is good enough for a man or woman. What&rsquo;s wrong about it is the use of a pair of white legs&hellip; with a tan belt. The tan belt just really breaks up the look of the character and doesn&rsquo;t suit this minifigure at all. She&rsquo;d be better off with all white pants or even a pair of white pants with a black belt. Even the re-use of the hairpiece from Prince of Persia&rsquo;s princess isn&rsquo;t bad because I do enjoy that hairpiece. (A shame they were re-using parts and didn&rsquo;t make a new colour for it.)</p>

<p>Court Jester: What&rsquo;s to say about this one? He&rsquo;s exactly the same minifigure as the one found in LEGO Kingdoms. Nothing is different about his print, he even has the same double-sided face with one side laughing and the other crying. Not a bad minifigure, although I would have liked to see this figure in a different colour scheme. Perhaps wearing the black and red colours of Harley Quinn as opposed to the exact same colours as the Kingdoms figure. But then again many have observed that these sets were slapped together from leftovers of the production for pick-a-brick minifigures.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Compared to the truly vintage style collections of the past, these 2013 collections from Bricktober are nice free offerings. Unfortunately some of the parts use is terrible&hellip; if you&rsquo;re looking to add more minifigures to your collection they were a decent offering when they cost nothing, tracking them down on the secondary market is entirely up to your personal tastes. I choose not to recommend these, not because they are horrible or anything, but because honestly most of these minifigures are not unique. The pieces are re-used from sets and other places and the overall presentation reeks of laziness on LEGO&rsquo;s part, since we all know they can do so much better.</p>

<p>The biggest draw for me for this set was the female characters and the City Cop is nice. The others are just meh. Mind you this set isn&rsquo;t the easiest to track down anymore. Still when we get to the other two we&rsquo;ll start to see some better options. And more lazy choices. Final thoughts; good for what it was at the time, but could be much better.</p>
