<p>Box</p>

<p>The box design is the same as discussed in the previous review&hellip; there isn&rsquo;t much to add to the description of the design of my thoughts on it, except this. I do like that each set has different colours for the logo and on the side, it&rsquo;s a nice eyecatching choice that helps differentiate each set. The first one was a dark blue, this one is dark green and the last is a dark red. It&rsquo;s a very nice design choice that at least breaks up the blandness of the yellow colour and lack of images on the box.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The five minifigures in this set are actually pretty decent compared to the first volume, while most of them are still generic they are also pretty fun.</p>

<p>City Male: He&rsquo;s the second weakest of the set, but quite useful for City minifigure building. He&rsquo;s got plain blue pants, a familiar single sided suit vest, or is it vest suit, either way the sleeves are white and the rest is black. He&rsquo;s got a tie too. His hairpiece is a nice light I want to say brown, but it might be an odd blonde or grey colour&hellip; Hard to tell. Overall a fairly decent figure that is&hellip; common in LEGO City sets.</p>

<p>Bridesmaid/Bride: I&rsquo;m not sure what she is meant to be, however she&rsquo;s pretty decent, if not for one problematic issue. She has a double-sided torso which I believe is identical to the bride from the CMF line, we see her re-using the same hairpiece from Prince of Persia and she has a double-sided face (Happy and upset). Her sloped brick lower body however is using a print from one of the Castle Princess figures. This is the one flaw of this combination of pieces, her torso does not match exactly the lower body, because of the golden belt worn by the princess that this originally came with, the upper body is missing the top of the belt that kind of forms a cohesive print.</p>

<p>Pirate Captain: This re-use of parts is pretty impressive. The double-sided torso print and the pirate hat with the skull and crossbones looks impressive combined with a traditional pirate looking facial print and plain black legs. His golden hook is a nice colour too, if you&rsquo;re a fan of pirates this Minifigure is a great addition to the ranks of hook-hand captains.</p>

<p>Castle King: This minifigure is the weakest, mostly because without a proper cape or accessories he&rsquo;s a bit disappointing. Also for some odd reason his head has some kind of flaw because his headgear is really loose. In fact every headgear you try with his head will be loose. He&rsquo;s using all of his pieces from the Kingdoms era lion knights, the legs have no printing, but the torso makes up for this as it has a double-sided one.</p>

<p>Astronaut: This is just a brilliant re-use of parts. I enjoy getting decent minifigures for City Spaceports so receiving this one in this set works as one of the crowning minifigures in this set. Why? Because when you take off the bulky Atlantis style diving gear being used as a space helmet you find that this minifigure is a female astronaut. The torso print is unisex, it has no obvious curves, and there is no spare hair for her, but she is a good addition to anybody&rsquo;s City Spaceport.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Personally I think this is the best offering of the trio of sets from Bricktober. It offers up a rare number of good minifigures with very few flaws. I find that the strongest members (the bride/bridesmaid, pirate captain and astronaut) help balance out the two weaker minifigures. Mind you some may prefer the king for their Castle theme, however since the face is a regular common knight face the use of the king&rsquo;s crown is a bit off-putting here. A shame none of these figures came with accessories, however if you collect LEGO Pirates you&rsquo;re bound to have some spare cutlasses lying around for him.</p>
