To the point where one of the minifigures with the best potential, suffers from a really poor part use. But we&rsquo;ll get to that when we discuss him&hellip; Onwards to the review!</p>

<p>Box</p>

<p>While I have commented twice already on these boxes and I may not have much to add here I still think there&rsquo;s something to say. These boxes make an easily stackable set, it&rsquo;s interesting to note because LEGO packaging isn&rsquo;t easy to use like the bricks from the sets. These boxes were designed more with that in mind, and while they don&rsquo;t attach to each other like the storage cases that LEGO creates (or the minifigure display cases) they could easily be turned into storage cases if LEGO had so wanted. Just an observation.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>As always these include 5 minifigures and the re-use of parts is&hellip; Well let&rsquo;s just discuss the figures and we&rsquo;ll get to that.</p>

<p>Race Car Driver: With a red racing helmet and clear visor, a minifigure face with sweat printed on it and the single-sided blue torso racing jacket this minifigure is pretty neat. The use of a pair of red legs with a black belt doesn&rsquo;t even stand out too much here. The only problem is we don&rsquo;t have a car for him to drive&hellip; Which makes his usefulness questionable if you haven&rsquo;t decided to MOC a car for him.</p>

<p>Chef: Yeah&hellip; Not much to say here. This is a pretty weak minifigure, but he can go anywhere in your LEGO City, or even add him to the Parisian Restaurant, he&rsquo;s got the standard single-sided torso chef top with regular white pants and chef&rsquo;s hat. The facial expression is a bit odd for a chef though, he&rsquo;s very upset about something.</p>

<p>City Female Denizen: This is the best minifigure, she&rsquo;s got a nice pair of purple pants with a double-sided purple dress print with flower necklace and gold sash. Her blonde hair is even good. She&rsquo;s the best figure of the set in my opinion because the parts used fit together so well.</p>

<p>Firefighter: He&rsquo;s the same figure from many City sets. In fact it almost looks like he&rsquo;s been taken directly from another set. He&rsquo;s good if you want more firefighters, but chances are you&rsquo;ve got tons by now. This is the only set with one female character, it might have been nicer to turn the firefighter into a woman&hellip; Or perhaps the next figure could have benefited from being a female.</p>

<p>Wizard: This minifigure is almost perfect, you&rsquo;ve got the printed wizard&rsquo;s hat, the printed legs, the beard, the impressive facial print that I think is a re-use from a Castle king and then&hellip; oh and then&hellip; you get a plain blue torso without any printing whatsoever. No wizard robes, no interesting or unique print, just a terrible plain blue top. Honestly I prefer my wizards to at least have some kind of torso print to show the robes they customarily wear, it would go so well with the belt and pouches and things he&rsquo;s got on his legs. What happened? Lazy part re-use that&rsquo;s what. If it weren&rsquo;t for that plain blue torso he&rsquo;d be perfect and a welcome addition to anyone&rsquo;s LEGO Castle. Oh well, if you got all three sets at least you could mix and match and give the king a better head I suppose.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>The only thing I recommend about this set is the female minifigure, she&rsquo;s got some great parts and the rest of these guys are a bit too generic even for a free set. Honestly I think Bricktober 2013 was a bit of a waste compared to what we got the following year, the microbuild modulars were a much better designed giveaway compared to these sets. Even the original vintage collection sets are much better, so paying secondary prices for these is&hellip; not the best. Unless it is for collection vol. 2. You aren&rsquo;t missing much if you missed these in 2013.</p>
