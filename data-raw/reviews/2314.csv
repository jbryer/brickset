"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-24T23:45:16Z","best of the HP sets","This is a really great set as far as HP goes. While the Hogwarts set was basically a 'dollhouse', it was the most complete building. However, with the second series, we got much more quality. Most of these buildings have at LEAST one wall, with an interior. However, the 'challenge' sets of the first series were horrible, just a bunch of thingies on a baseplate, so Chamber should be the same, right? Well, I'm happy to say... wrong ^_^. Two sets in particular, Dumbledore's Office, and Chamber of Secrets, can actually be stand-alone buildings with little or no modification. 

Of course, I'm reviewing Chamber, so I'll have to stick to that one &lt;_&lt;. The Chamber of Secrets is the closest Harry Potter has to a four-sided 'castle'.(Dumbledore is more of a tower)By adding barriers, flipping the bathroom, and converting it to a throne room, you have a four-sided castle, with a trapdoor in the throne room that dumps people back out, and four secret entrances(two of which can end up being 'broken' by intruders in a frenzied battle), you have a castle, and a pretty decent one, too. 

Not that there's a whole lot wrong with the chamber. Other than that it is nothing like the CoS in the movie, this set is pretty solid in  most ways. And either way, it isn't *HARD* to convert it to a more movie-style CoS, or a 'evil' castle. And with it's modular design, you can do a lot with this set with minimal deconstruction(provided you have the spare parts). I've personally done the above modifications, halved the 'large' tower(if you have the set, or have seen the instructions, you know what I mean) and added some things to the flat bit with the stained-glass window so the sword can be held inside.

Oh, and i've moved the head thingy, so it's the door. Nice door for an evil castle, in my opinion.

finally, I added dragon wings to the Basilisk to make a 'Quetzacoatl' type monster. Fun! :D

Now, if i could just make a simular 'good' castle to do war with it. Hmm, maybe I should deconstruct my Hogwarts for that...


Anyways, This set really is great. Nice minifigs(good to have another Slytherin for my army of evil mages), nice monster(so customisable), great structure, and that annoying fact that no pictures seem to do justice to it. They make it look like a wall or a set with too much white space. Oh, and  uncommon/exclusive pieces are nice. Love the 'snake' shields and wall plates",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-15T19:36:12Z","very good","I got this set for $49.99 at a local store.It is better than it looks.I like the sink,but it should be higher and have a bigger bowl.I like how the trapdoor works,but there should have been a tunnel that you fill with rocks,like the movie.I like the Ginny,her hair is perfect for a Faramir.Riddle is nice but hair should be brown(that's how it looks in the movie)and shaped different from Harry's.The basilisk is very well done,using the form used for the dinosaur sets.I like the turn feature on the left wall,where the sword is hidden.On the other wall pushing on a long plate causes the snake walls fall to reveal the Sorting Hat.Fakwes is very oddly placed,but can be moved.
In all,a very good set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-16T00:09:52Z","Better than expected,","I got this set for 60% off or so, and ended up getting two. Much better set than I expected. It had it's fair share of pre-made pieces, but it has some very worthwhile pieces. The shields especially impressed me, although there are only 2 per set, so you can't make a large force. It has some large amounts of pieces such as inverse 1x2x3 grey slopes, and 1x2 curve pieces. I would not buy it at full price, but it was definately worth it on sale.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-08T06:31:10Z","Possibly the best harry potter set.","The Good

-As a recent but out of production set, you can probably find one on clearance. I got mine for $35.
-Faithful to the story
-Playable. Doesnt HAVE to be a harry potter scene, but rather any ol' monster lair
-Great selection of parts, has loads of old-gray bricks!
-Glow in the dark knives!
-A sink!
-Possibly the first time i've seen two distinct colors of plastic used for a single piece ABS element, a red and orange phoenix

The Bad

-I still can't think of an alternate use for the huge brick-baseplates.
-The phoenix is asymmetrical, reducing its reuse. If it was symmetrical, you can use it as the bow ornament for a ship or an art-deco gargoyle or something
-Transparent neon-green spider?

The ugly

Set is big, snake is a little overkill it is quite large, but the fangs do glow in the dark!! Really like all the mini figures in the set, like the grey bricks used to make the skull.

"MasterBuilder","2009-01-07T08:23:49.653Z","Lockhart: I can easily climb back up that slide...","Very accurate to movie. The snake walls make sense, and add a good feature because they fall out. Also the waterfall thing is designed ok, and whatever the thing on the other side is. Comes with lots of turrets and towers so you can add to your Castle collection nicely should you take it apart and mix it in. The minifigs are good, and the wall son I think the left side turn around to reveal Harry's sword. I think the sword should have been different, however (maybe a ninja katana?), so that it could fit into the Sorting Hat. The only other thing I don't like is the slide in the bathroom, because Lockhart could just climb back up when no one was looking. Also Salazar Slytherin's head, because you cannot reenact Harry climbing onto his nose or eyebrow or whatever. Lastly the bathroom is right inside the Chamber. They should have either added a small part onto this, or made a whole different set as the entryway (I prefer the former). Sides close for a scene of Harry running down the center or else fighting the basilisk, or open for play. Whew I just wrote a lot...I think longest review so far...

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION - 

Ok sorry everyone I think the towers are there to show that Hogwarts is above there or something I don't know. But you can take them off and put the 2001 Great Hall on there. Ok this set has pros and cons.

Pros:
Fawkes is cool
The basilisk is cool
Ginny is cool
Tom Riddle is cool
Lockhart I hate, but he still looks cool

"mngoult","2010-01-06T07:56:51.887Z","Now this is more like it, Awesome set.","This is what lego can do with alittle thought and a few bricks, create a lovely set with endless features and lovely touches throughout.

The two corridor sections are well built and both feature the possibility of causing the walls sections to be knocked over. Hidden behind them are cool additions like snakes or the sword of Godric. 

The toilet section is done as well as possible and features trapdoor style section to gain access to the chamber. The statue (where the Basalisk comes in) is ofen criticised but is a nice attempt considering the peice count and at least they didin't resort to a huge pre fabricated statue. 

The Basalisk is nice and all the minifgs are welcome, especially Lockheart in pink, Ginny and Tom Riddle. Also inlcuded are the diary and Fawkes. There is also a lovley window effect in one of the towers made from trans red and green bricks. 

An easy five stars for me, this set features so many unique pieces and minifigs and sits nicely under 4709 (no wobbling the table though).

Pros
Rare minifgs and pieces.
Set opens out for playability.
Lots of features to explore and walls to knock down.
Loads of tower sections.
Designed to sit under 4709 and make a super castle.

Cons
Hinge system is a little fragile and the corridor piece is only held on to the toilet section with a 2x3 grey brick. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-11T08:33:34.81Z","LEGO Harry Potter - The Chamber of Secrets Review","I remember I got this set for my birthday a long time ago. It has lot's of play features and comes with 3 exclusive minifigs which you can only get in this set. The first exclusive minifig is Gilderoy Lockhard who comes with his dark pink suit. The other rare 2 characters which are included in this set are Tom Riddle with the yellow skin and Ginny Weasley with the yellow skin. You also get a basic Harry Potter and a basic Ron Weasley minifig in this model. This set is also the only set which comes with a phenix and the huge snake which is called a basilisk.<br><br>The built was long and it was also a lot of fun. This scene includes the bathroom where Harry, Ron and Lockhard come into the chamber. What I like about this scene is are the wall pieces which have the big snake head on it. Also the shields on the top with the snake head look very interesting. One feature on one side of the walls is that you can push the walls down to see the wizard hat for example. On the other side the walls do open and you can see a sword and a snake. The last part which we get is the gate which you can open to free the basilisk. This set also included Tom Riddles diary. I love the play features which we get here and I really can't complain about this set.<br><br>All

"LegoAdventures","2011-01-22T21:32:23.597Z","The Chamber of Secrets ","This is a truly remarkable set!. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Chamber of Secrets</span> was inevitably created under the Dungeons of Hogwarts Castle during Medieval Times by Salazar Slytherin, who disagreed with the other Founders of Hogwarts on the Merits of Blood Purity. And I have to say that Lego really did this set Justice, The Dark Blacks and Grays give it a really Shuddersome, Chilling and Ghastly vibe to the entire set, and it looks Outstanding. Released in 2002 to Coincide with the Blockbuster release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</span>, it contains 591 Pieces, 5 Mini-figures 2 Large sections of the Chamber itself, The Salazar Slytherin Statue Head and the Colossal Basilisk. I managed to get this set from Ebay in a New Sealed Box in Excellent Condition for $124 AUD, and I can strongly say, do not surpass the opportunity to get this set because it is Marvelous. <br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions: </h4><br>The Box is 37.8cm Long, 38cm Tall and 7.1cm Thick. The Box consists of its usual features and offerings from Lego like the Red Lego Insignia and Illustration of the Chamber of Secrets on the Front.

On the back of the Box there is 3 Alternative Models which can be Built from the back of the Instructions or from LEGO.com, however I don't think the Link is there anymore. Other features include different angles of the Mini-figures and parts of the set, a complete look of the inside of the set and various details of the accessories included. On the bottom of the Box there is the usual Trademarks, Licensed Agreements, Future References, Copyrights and where the Components are made. For this set everything from the Box, Packaging and pieces are all made in Denmark. That's one thing i love about Lego is that it's Quality European Manufactured. Inside the Box there is 4 Plastic Bags numbered from 1-4 which makes the Building Experience a bit easier. There is also a Pamphlet which shows most of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Philosophers Stone</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Chamber of Secrets</span> sets and how to arrange them for a large scale Castle.

The Vest features Beautiful Pink flower patterns with Metallic Gold outlines around the Flowers and Metallic stalks. He also features lovely Sand Pink Pants and a Sand Pink Cape resembling his Robes. Gilderoy features one of the most lovely coloured wands, it's like a Mild Creamy Tan Brown that looks fantastic. <br><br><h4>Basilisk: </h4><br>The Basilisk is an Outstanding feature in the set. It features 2 Sand Green Printed Serpent Body pieces that have Printed Scale Patterns on the sides of the Body. You connect these 2 via a Black Tube piece that goes into 2 holes in both the 2 Body pieces. You then place a 2x4 Sand Green plate on top of these 2 Serpent Body pieces so it becomes completely secure and strong. You then place a large Sand Green Neck piece and a part of the Serpents Large Tail, Followed by the Basilisk's Head which is an Incredible full Custom peice. It features 2 Trans-Neon Yellow Studs for it's eyes and 2 Glow in the Dark Mini-figure Dagger/Knife pieces for it's sharp Fangs/Teeth. You then place another Sand Green Tail piece followed by a much smaller Sand Green Tail piece that finishes the Basilisk off. <br><br><h4>Salazar Slytherin Head Statue: </h4><br>You start of with a Black Base plate and you place 8 Dark Grey Flat Tile Lego pieces in the middle of the Base plate that are spaced out evenly so there is 4 Dark Grey Tiles on one side and 4 Dark Grey Tiles on the other side. You then start with 1 Dark Grey Hinge that has a formation of Black and Light Grey Lego Tiles that become the supporting structure of numerous Dark Grey Sloped Pieces that are the Beginning of Salazar Slytherin's Beard. You then place this behind 1 of the 4 Dark Grey Tile formations, so now you can swing this Beard type Formation back and forth smoothly. You then repeat this process however on the other side and in a different angle so now you have 2 Beard Type formations that can move back and forth smoothly. You then Build a very small formation of Dark Grey Sloped pieces that go behind the Beard Type formations you built earlier. Now when you swing the Beard Type Formations so there closed you have a 3D type Salazar Slytherin Beard effect, and the Black pieces that you used earlier in the process look like an opened mouth so it looks like Salazar Slytherin's Mouth is opened with his Dark Grey Beard all around his Mouth and Chin. You then Build some Hinges at the front of this Black Base plate that will soon be used later in the Building Experience. You then place some Green sloped pieces with 2 Green Cone pieces that allow you to put 2 Trans-Neon Fire pieces at the top of them. You then finish by building Salazar Slytherins Head which is a formation of Light Grey sloped pieces for his Bald Head and a Large Light Grey sloped peice for his nose. You also place 2 White Triangular bricks and 2 Black small tiles in front to resemble his eyes. Now you have a complete Salazar Slytherin Head. Last but not least you place Tom Riddles Diary on the Base Plate that has Ink coming out of the Top. <br><br><h4>Tower 1 Bathroom Section: </h4><br>You start of with a Dark Grey Base plate that has a small Black attachment for a Black Serpent. You then build some sloped structures that support the above level that you soon build. You then place a 6x6 Black plate which has various small Light Grey Tiles on it to allow a Mini-figure to slide down it. Now you place some pieces underneath the 6x6 Black plate and attach it to a small formation of bricks. Now you can lift this piece up and down freely. You then place 2 large Black arch pieces and then a small Dark Grey Trap door piece, You also place 2 Black pieces underneath 1 of the arches to attach 2 Trans Orange Flame pieces. You then place numerous Black and White Tile pieces on the top of the Trap Door floor piece to resemble Bathroom tiles. You then place a Custom Bathroom Tap peice which completes the Bathroom area. Underneath the Trapdoor is large Black Cylindrical piece. You then push the Black 6x6 Black plate that you made earlier and push it up against the Large Black Cylindrical peice. Now the only support that the Bathroom floor Trap door piece has is the 6x6 piece, so when you push that forwards it drops the Bathroom floor and makes the 6x6 piece drop as well, so you basically have a large slid. After placing a Mini-fig on the top and doing this process, the Mini-fig will quickly drop down and slid down to the Ground. You then Build a wall structure behind the Custom Tap peice that has an arched window piece and various Beige Stone wall structures around the Bathroom which supports a large Emerald Green Tower Roof that completes this section.<br><br><h4>Tower 2:</h4><br>This section is one of the small Tower structures that is placed on top of the 2 Chamber sections after they are Built. It basically consists of a 6x6 Black plate peice that has some Dark Grey pieces, Emerald Green Cone pieces and Beige pieces that make a type of Barrier or small wall. You then place 1 Beige Tower piece which has an arched window in the middle, and you finish it off with 3 Emerald Green Cone Roof structures. <br><br><h4>Tower 3:</h4><br>This section is another one of the small Tower structures that are placed on top of the 2 Chamber sections after they are Built. It basically consists of a 6x6 Black plate piece that has a small wall of Dark Grey pieces and in the middle of those Structures is a formation of 3 Trans-Neon Green Squares and 3 Trans-Neon Red Squares which resemble an ancient Glass structure. You then place 2 Dark Grey Pylon structures and place a Black Flat piece on top that has 4 studs on 1 side. You then place a Beige Tower structure similar to Tower 2 that has an arch window in the middle and 3 Emerald Green Cone structures on the top. You also place a Light Grey Owl on a formation of 1 Dark Grey Triangular piece and 1 Beige Triangular piece. <br><br><h4>Chamber Section 1:</h4><br>This section features a large 8x16 Black base plate. You then place a Dark Grey Tower piece with an arch in the middle on the far back corner of the base plate. You also place 2 Black Flat tiles next to the Tower. At the front of the base plate you place numerous Dark Grey plates that you then place 2 large 2x12 Light Grey plates and a Curved Light Grey Plate on the side at the end of the 2x12 Light Grey plates which resemble the middle path when Harry is running up to check if Ginny is alive. You then place a Dark Grey piece in the middle of the 2 Black Flat tiles that you originally placed earlier and on top of that Dark Grey piece is a Trans-Neon Yellow Spider. Next to that is a formation of Dark Grey pieces and on top of that there is a Black plate that has 3 Trans Cobalt Blue Grooved tiles, resembling Water. There is also a Black attachment for a Black Serpent. Underneath this there is a Light Grey piece that is attached to 2 pieces that have holes in the middle of them which enable you to tilt the Black plate that has 3 Trans Cobalt Blue pieces and the Serpent back and forth. On the other side of that you build the same formation with the 2 Black Flat tiles and Dark Grey peice, except on top of this Dark Grey peice you have the Black Sorting Hat (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Which is Brown in the Movie hehe</span>) and is resting on a Green Cylindrical piece. You also place a Dark Grey Tower peice at the end next to the Sorting Hat so it's almost symmetrical when looking at this section from the front. You then Build a small formation of a Dark Grey arch peice and 2 long Dark Grey Triangular pieces on top of the 3 Trans Cobalt Blue and Serpent Mechanism you built before to make it look like the Serpent and water pieces are coming out from the Arch. You then place 2 large walls with Printed Serpent Heads on them to Hide the Sorting Hat and Trans-Neon Yellows Spider. Basically what you do then is you Tilt the formation that has the 3 Cobalt Blue pieces and Black Serpent on it, and that has a large piece behind it that pushes the walls with the Printed Serpent Patterns on it down, to reveal the Sorting Hat and Trans-Neon Spider Behind it. You then build a small Perch for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Fawkes</span> the Phoenix to sit on, Fawkes is a lovely Custom piece which features Vermont Orange and Geranium Red all mixed together. You then build a large formation of arches and a Shield with a Serpent on it that is displayed in the middle of the arch formations. To finish it of you place some Black plates and Green sloped pieces on the very top of the Arch formations so the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">4709 Hogwarts Castle</span> can be placed on top. And last but not least 2 Trans Orange Flame pieces that are on top of 2 Green Cone pieces that you place in front of the arch formation were the Trans Blue water pieces are. <br><br><h4>Chamber Section 2:</h4><br>This section is Identical to the Chamber Section 1, It features the huge 8x16 base plate and 2 Dark Towers with Arch windows on both ends, and the suspended Light Grey path that Harry runs along to see if Ginny is Alive. A different feature for this section is instead of the Walls being placed on the ground with a variety of tiles and stud pieces that allow it to be knocked over, the printed Serpent Walls in this section are connected on a small turn table piece which will soon allow a mechanism to push the walls forward so you can see what's behind. On one of the walls you place a Black Serpent. On the other wall you place the Chrome Silver Godric Gryffindor Sword Behind. In the middle of these walls you build a mechanism which allows you to pull a plate which has 2 Black Serpents attached to it and after you pull that forward the 2 walls spin in and Reveal what's attached behind them. Above this mechanism you build 2 Sloped pieces and inside that there is 1 Trans Clear Wine Glass and on both sides in front of the sloped pieces there is 2 Trans Orange Flame pieces above 2 Emerald Green Cone pieces. You then build the Arch formations and Black plates with Emerald Green slopes that allow you to place the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">4709 Hogwarts Castle</span> on top. And last but not least you place a Shield that has a Serpent head on it. Now you can connect the Hinges that you placed on the Salazar Slytherin head to both Chamber section, then you can open Salazar Slytherin's Mouth and have the Basilisk come through.<br><br><h4>Overall:</h4><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm so sorry if this review was hard to understand however there were some parts that were so hard to explain, however i tried my best</span>. Overall this is an Outstanding set, and one of the Best Harry Potter sets ever, I can't say what the best Harry Potter set is because their all so Incredible in there own way. So i strongly recommend this set with full confidence that you will enjoy it, A complete Triumph 5/5!<br><br>Thank you so much for reading my review :)&nbsp;",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"BobaFett2","2010-09-03T10:49:20.96Z","A nice set, though a tad juniorized","Out of the licensed themes, Harry Potter and Star Wars tend to stand out as the first and in many aspects, the best. Made in 2002, this set was not as juniorized as many of the new sets.<h4>Parts</h4><div>This set is nice for parts, though not exceptional. It has a lot of castle tower parts (but unfortunately, they are very juniorized). The walls are a bit annoying and difficult to use but they are nicely patterned. The set has a lot of nice sand green and tan, along with some other good parts. Very good parts include the Pheonix, Silver Sword, the Basilisk, the Fire, and some other parts.</div><h4>Building and Playability</h4><div>It's been a long time since I built it but overall it's a pretty nice build. Nothing much of interest, and it could easily be improved if you have the parts. As for playability, there are some cool functions.

The build wasn't too challenging and the moving parts were enjoyable. I loved the way you could push Lock heart down the trapdoor and how the statue opened up. The snake was so cool. &lt;p&gt; It was a great addition to my Hogwarts sets and I would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;&nbsp;it.",FALSE,5,5,4,5,4
