"BluntDiplomat","2014-01-10T18:54:19.353Z","It's a bird! It's a plane! No, it's a saloon?! And a kebab stand!","<p><strong>Set 70812: Creative Ambush</strong>: One of the offerings for this season's wave of The Lego Movie-themed sets, Creative Ambush has got to be the quirkiest Lego set I've run into in recent memory. Featuring two vehicles - a kebab stand-turned-winged hovercraft and a saloon-turned-biplane, as well as the evil micromanager robot, this set earns my top endorsement as a Lego fan and parent for its incredible value, its great selection of parts, its playability, and how fun the overall models are and how much fun my nephew had building them.</p>

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>

<p>Like its fellow TLM sets, the box for Creative Ambush is glossy and very inviting. From the looks of it with the fighting/ambush occurring on city streets (presumably Bricksburg, where the movie is set), it seems that this set maybe depicting one of the later scenes of the movie, when minifigures and sets from various Lego themes must band together to stop President/Lord Business. However, having not seen the movie, this is purely conjecture. The back of the box depicts all three models together and separately, and highlights some play features like the flick-fire kebab missiles on the kebab stand and the canons mounted on the wings of the biplane. Inside the box, there are 4 bags (Bag 1 for the micromanager, Bag 2 for the kebab stand, Bag 3 for the saloon biplane's fuselage, and Bag 4 for the saloon biplane's magnificent wings), a sticker sheet (more on that later), and two instruction books (Book 1 is for the micromanager and the kebab stand, Book 2 is for the saloon biplane).&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Parts</h4>

<p>My nephew and I both are both crazy about the pieces that came with this set. There was a great selection of colors, and I was impressed by the artful use of common pieces to add detail and richness to the completed models - from buckets being used as exhaust pipes and treasure chests being used as storage compartments on the biplane, to the use of 1x2 transparent red grill pieces as a heating lamp to the spinning cone of meat on the kebab stand. My favorite details? It's a tossup between the spinning cone of meat on the kebab stand and the gold 1x2 faucet/tap piece being used as a control panel for the biplane. There's also axles included to enable to meat cone to spin, as well as two firing cannons, a wonderful selection of sloped and grilled pieces, and a diverse offering of accessories, such as bottles, sticks of dynamite, frying pans, pistols, whips, mugs, knives, and condiment dispensers. And at less than 0.09 USD per piece, this set is a great value compared to other sets from this wave. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Minifigures</h4>

<p>The set comes with 4 minifigs: Executive Ellen, Kebab Bob, Sudds Buckwash, and Rootbeer Belle. Having not seen the movie, I'm really unsure how prominent a role any of the four will play, but it is safe to say that all four are exclusive to this set for the moment. Of the four, only Executive Ellen features a double-sided head (one terrified expression, and another of corporate disdain), while Rootbeer Belle has a wedge piece for legs. All four minifigs have back printing. My favorite of the four is Kebab Bob, as I find him to be the most richly detailed of them all: his shirt is stained with grease, as is his apron (which is printed on his legs); the back printing on him is his apron tied around his back, and even his hat features a sizzling cone of spinning meat. My nephew's favorite is Sudds Buckwash because he wears a bowler hat and sports a handlebar mustache.</p>

<h4>The build</h4>

<p>My nephew and I found the build to be incredibly fun and entertaining. What makes this set a true winner and must-have are all the little details and cool techniques involved in its construction. While the micromanager is fairly straightforward (think AT-ST's evil twin), the kebab stand features hidden axles to make the meat cone spin, and the biplane is rich in non-superfluous details. The wings of the plane were my nephew's favorite part to build, and it has inspired him to adapt the technique to future creations in lieu of purchasing actual wing-shaped pieces. All in all, it took us about 70 minutes to finish the set - he did the sorting and building, and I did the job of champions: stickering. Yes, this set has stickers: a punishing 14 stickers - 5 on the kebab stand and 9 on the saloon biplane. Of these 14, the most cumbersome to affix were the Octan stickers that go on the tail fins of the kebab stand.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The completed model</h4>

<p>The finished models are beautiful. My nephew loves the biplane, while I'm quite enamored with the kebab stand. As its name suggests, this is definitely a very creative ambush - one that President/Lord Business himself would not have anticipated. You don't have to squint your eyes or be rendered quizzical to see that you do have a kebab stand and a saloon before you - although in forms that you may not have imagined them in before. The set as a whole is so eccentrically charming, and it really communicates the theme of unbounded creativity and imagination that I think the Lego Movie is all about and the limitless play potential of Lego itself.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>

<p>My nephew was immediately drawn to this set because he found the it to be so unbelievably peculiar, but not so overly weird that the completed models cannot stand on their own and be played with separately or exist as is within the universe of his own Lego collection. All three models - the micromanager, the kebab stand hovercraft, and the saloon biplane - are all well-rounded in terms of design and detail, and all have great playability. As an AFOL and Lego uncle, I have no major issues with this set - the 14 stickers notwithstanding. Creative Ambush earns top marks from me, and I strongly encourage you to go out and get this set if you can. You will have a lot of fun building it and playing with it, and you will not be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

"figura","2014-01-15T11:44:26.953Z","Everything is awesome - especially this","<p>This set quickly became a must-have for me as soon as the first images of The LEGO Movie were released. So naturally it was also the first I picked up from this new line and I was not disappointed.</p>

<p>The set comes with 473 pieces and four unique minifigures.</p>

<p>[img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/61762a584e1c749640afe7fee15eb6d6/tumblr_mz3dm6F84U1rir6lho1_1280.png[/img]</p>

<p>It consists of three separate builds: a western plane, a flying kebab stand, and a so-called Micro Manager&ndash;one of Lord Business&rsquo; evil machines. Like most vehicles from the theme the ones in this set look like quite crazy and as if they were built from something else, but unlike the Ice Cream Machine (70804), the Trash Chomper (70805), the Castle Cavalry (70806) and the Flying Flusher (70811) this set does not contain additional instructions to built what those vehicles could have previously been.</p>

<p>The box contains four bags and two instruction manuals: the first one for the Micro Manager and the flying kebab stand (bag 1+2), the second for the western plane (bag 3+4). Let&rsquo;s start directly with the highlight, the plane.</p>

<p>The double-decker is a heavily armed flying saloon, with a wing-mounted canon on each side, machine guns next to the engine and&nbsp;dynamite dropping treasure chests in the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/6e340821eb4c1e673c2f4f682ffc89e0/tumblr_mz3dm6F84U1rir6lho3_1280.png[/img]</p>

<p>It is a lot of fun to build, even though I was expecting the wings to be foldable, but I guess that would have made them even more fragile than they anyway are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/f66c0f7eea10ebbd87be3953377f2ec0/tumblr_mz3dm6F84U1rir6lho5_1280.png[/img]</p>

<p>In the body of the plane there is space for two minifigures. Judging by the studs, Rootbeer Belle is piloting the plane while Sudds Backwash is playing the piano in the back. For the engine&ndash;just like the whole set&ndash;a lot of interesting pieces were used, including two revolvers.</p>

<p>[img]http://24.media.tumblr.com/b70c3dde4694db70bf6d1e419b2195b7/tumblr_mz3dm6F84U1rir6lho4_1280.png[/img]</p>

<p>I read a few complaints online, that the slightly older revolvers were chosen over the new, more detailed ones from the Lone Rangers sets. To me it makes sense since this is not a licensed theme that is about recreating as much detail as possible, but a LEGO theme that has LEGO and its variety as a topic, so of course pieces that are easier to alienate from their original purpose were chosen. Anyway. The back fin has some interesting stickers (yes, there are many of them and almost no printed pieces) one of which has a list of names that <em>are currently not given to any known minifigures, so maybe there are some further movie characters teased here</em>. <strong>Correction: the names belong to</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Phil Lord (director), Christopher Miller (director), Chris McKay (animation director, editor), Grant Freckelton (production designer)</strong>.</p>

<p>The next part I built was the flying kebab stand. It is a very simple built using a large plate for the start and then basically just attaching stuff to it. But in the end it looks really funny. Its main features are the kebab flick missiles an the rotating kebab itself. it is mainly decorated with stickers as well (five to be exact) except for some small displays. While the body is mostly white, the ship has a lot of red and yellow stripes as decor which&ndash;in my habit of building in all spare pieces&ndash;I continued even for the operating handles in the front.</p>

<p>Finally there is the micromanager. These robots appear in eight of the thirteen sets and are always altered, despite their main body being a black cube. The one in this set has two strong legs and two front facing&nbsp;clutches that drive the fear into Exuctive Ellen&rsquo;s face (she is the only figure in this set to have a double-sided head piece).</p>

<p>Since one of the main lessons from the movie seems to be to always use your creativity, I also went ahead and build what the vehicles could have originally been.</p>

<p>[img]http://25.media.tumblr.com/048ff5babdc8b96b86c51aca9788ce68/tumblr_mz3dm6F84U1rir6lho9_1280.png[/img]</p>

<p>The plane I turned into a saloon with swing doors, a bar with a decorated large back wall where Belle can bartend and larger piano than Sudds had in the plane and for more comfort he also got a stool. Kebab Bob&rdquo;s stand was less easy since there were very limited options for the wheels and their suspension, but Bob seems to be happy with the result as long as you &ldquo;Remember to TIP!&rdquo; as it says on his menu.</p>

<p>So all I have left to say is, that if you have the chance I recommend you get this set!</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is a really fun build, no matter if you stick to the instruction or go as crazy as the designers seem to have done.</li>
	<li>It has great play features and a large amount of details.</li>
	<li>It has beautiful, unique minifigures that will work great in other environments too.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is really not a single negative aspect I could think of that makes this not a outstandingly great set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-10-11T19:17:15.853Z","Steampunk Meets Wild West","<p><strong>Set #70812 Creative Ambush:</strong> LEGO chose to make this set a Target exclusive, which makes it fortunate that they opened in Canada recently as you can find this set there and there alone. Which is unfortunate because it is a really great set, worthy of picking up. True you can also find it at LEGO stores and LEGO online, but nothing beats finding a set in person so you can get it home and open it right away, also LEGO stores are fairly difficult to find in Canada.</p>

<p>Anyway let&#39;s discuss the set&#39;s good points, it&#39;s not so good points and it&#39;s awesome points.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is great and not just because of the design, the image chosen to show off this set is pretty impressive and action packed. Plus the designs for this Theme really are fun, I&#39;m not sure what else to say about it, except perhaps that the size fits this set nicely too because the bags aren&#39;t squashed too badly inside.</p>

<p>There are two instruction booklets in the set, one for the Micromanager and Bob&#39;s Kabobs flying thing and the other for the plane. Each of them are different sizes too, I&#39;ve noticed of late that LEGO sets these days don&#39;t keep consistent sizes for their various price points of LEGO instruction manuals. It&#39;s curious to me because I don&#39;t notice much different in how the booklets are made so aside from the size I&#39;m not sure why they change them like this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a lot of interesting pieces, and a lot of fun pieces, aside from the gear pieces and the cannons you&#39;ll find some familiar old school windows, four bottles, some nice gold pieces and the sculpted engine intakes. You also have a nice selection of brown pieces here and Bob&#39;s Kabob vehicle includes a few gems, including the impressive awning parts and the ice cream cone parts (being used here for Sish Kabob sticks). Overall a lot of useful parts and great options for MOCs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this set you&#39;ll find four unique characters from the film and one buildable Micromanager.</p>

<p>The Micromanager is one of the medium sized versions of this character, it stands roughly the height of a big fig with two claw arms that have limited range of motion. It also has limited leg motion compared to the larger builds, however I do like the design. The claws can grasp minifigures and launch a flick fire missile from it&#39;s side. A fairly decent character represented here.</p>

<p>Next up is Executive Ellen, a minifugre that the box depicts as the victim of the micromanager in this set, she&#39;s pretty impressive. She has a simple double-sided torso with a nifty suit jacket and plain dark blue pants with no print. She comes with a nice new hairpiece, and has a double-sided head print, one side regular business mode the other terrified and about to be kragled while in the clutches of the micromanager. She comes with a suitcase too.</p>

<p>Kabob Bob is an awesome Minifigure, he&#39;s got a dual sided torso print stained with the juices and condiments of his day job, as well as a small happy face pin and a name tag that is illegible. His legs include an apron print and he&nbsp;comes with the baseball cap with the logo of his business printed on it. His accessories are meat cutting knives, the kabobs used in his missiles and some cups that are part of his vehicle build.</p>

<p>Sudds Backwash is just pure awesome because of his name alone. It&#39;s so comical and fits the theme of the movie perfectly. His design is simple and fits the western theme nicely, it&#39;s a double-sided torso print with white arms as he&#39;s wearing a vest. His facial print has an awesome mustache and he&#39;s wearing that great bowler hat. He also has revolvers.</p>

<p>Last is Rootbeer Belle, she&#39;s another great western themed minifigure, a saloon serving girl with an awesome double-sided printed torso and printed sloped brick dress. She only has one sided facial print with a smiling look and a great hairpiece. She doesn&#39;t have any actual accessories in this set, though I imagine you could give her the bottles to serve customers with. She serves as the pilot in the set hence why I think she doesn&#39;t include any official accessories.</p>

<p>All in all this set has a great group of minifigures and they are all unique so no Emmets or other main characters to clutter your collection here. Now let&#39;s move on to discuss the models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Each bag has a separate build, Bag number 1 is the weakest with the Micromanager, and I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad build, only that the bag has the fewest pieces and the build is in some areas repetitive.</p>

<p>Bag two builds a flying kabob stand owned by Bob the LEGO Kabob dealer and worker of Octan Tasty Meat company. It doesn&#39;t have all the parts to actually make this a 2-1 build, however it&#39;s still a pretty fun build and features moving gears for a play gimmick. It&#39;s not the best build from the set, but it is an awesome little build and looks great as part of the whacky flying attack craft from The LEGO Movie.</p>

<p>Bag three and four both build the plane, the third bag builds the chassis while bag four builds up the wings and a few extra touches. This build is the most satisfying, you&#39;re basically taking the parts from an old Western saloon and making a flying bi-plane that has similar elements to steam punk designs, at least in certain small areas. Nothing as obvious as the Monster Fighters vehicles, but still a really fun build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve discussed the Micromanager in the minifigures section, so I&#39;ll just skip to the two vehicles.</p>

<p>The Bob&#39;s Kabob flying craft is great, it&#39;s a little awkward to hold for playing with it, however I think this is because it is so compact. The design is a bit on the whacky side and it includes more stickers than printed elements, but it also comes with some great play gimmicks. The meet cooker which is a simple geared gimmick where you spin one gear in the back and it turns the pressure cooker to prepare the food for the flick-fire shish kabob missiles. (Also a nice play feature.)</p>

<p>The saloon biplane is the best build in this set of awe inspiring builds. It really deserves the name creative ambush because the builds are just creative and fun. This plane has a load of fun features, even if the elements are using stickers instead of a printed feature, there&#39;s firing cannons, dynamite dropping treasure chests and a great look. I can believe it was slapped together by pieces of a saloon, especially with a barrel on the propeller/motor section and the great piano build incorporated into the rear section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set and spent a lot of time hunting it down when the Theme first came out, this and the Flying Flusher are two of the toughest to track down in Canada (and I still haven&#39;t gotten the latter) it&#39;s loaded with great design choices and includes some impressive minifigures. I love the builds in this set too and they make great models to play with and display on your LEGO shelves. I strongly recommend trying to find this one if you haven&#39;t picked it up yet because you&#39;re going to love it. It&#39;s quirky, fun and a real statement which fits this Theme to a T.</p>

"space_llamas","2014-03-14T23:20:11.45Z","Lego at its finest","<p>These sets at first confused me. Who would want a set without any exiting minifigures? Turns out my fetish of minifigures&nbsp;blocked me from realizing this line of sets aren&#39;t about good minifigures or the usual stuff. This is lego reminding us what lego is all about. The building. This set isnt&nbsp;about the figs, its about the good stuff. and that good stuff? yeah, its GOOD.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Comes in a fairly large box with the standard lego&nbsp;movie artwork.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some good pieces in here. For example, you have the ice cream cone pieces, sink top piece, engine pieces, and a whole lot of other good stuff.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Now even though this set isn&#39;t about the minifigs, that doesn&#39;t stop them from being good.</p>

<p>Executive Ellen: A nice business-y figure with good printing and a double sided face. The thing i don&#39;t like about this figure is the hair piece. It has a weird thing going on on the bottom-back of the piece. (don&#39;t know how to describe it don&#39;t&nbsp;judge me ._.)</p>

<p>Sudds&nbsp;Backwash: A nice old western figure with minimal printing and is very simple. Good figure.</p>

<p>Rootbeer Belle: A nice looking old western lady with good printing on the dress. Another good figure.</p>

<p>Kabob Bob: Last but not least, Kabob Bob. Bob is my favorite figure in this set. He has nice printing with the apron, Kabob Bob hat, condiment stains, and smiley face pin. He&#39;s just appealing to me.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Your building a bi-plane made of a saloon and a flying kebab stand. Of course its gonna be a fun build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Micro Manager: The third biggest (I think) Micro Manager in the series, this one has complete movement in the legs and arms and has one flick fire missile on the side. Its hands can grab the heads of minifigures to give it good playability.</p>

<p>Kabob stand: A great vehicle. I absolutely&nbsp;love the creativity in this vehicle. It has a structure that seems to me like an insect. The wings are made out of the menu, it has kebab flick missiles, and it has a mechanism to turn the kettle. It is also covered with stuff you would find in a kebab stand like knives, condiments, cooking controls signs and more.</p>

<p>Saloon bi-plane: Very VERY nice and creative piece. There are so many great artifacts hidden on this plane that would be in a saloon, such as swing doors, dart boards, a piano, whips, chests, the sign for the saloon, creaky wood boards and so much more. This plane looks absolutely&nbsp;fantastic. The front of the plane has the very good looking engine with the propeller. The wings look very good with the cannon and the bar stool supports. The only problem with this plane is that bar stools don&#39;t&nbsp;make good supports. This plane&#39;s wings are very fragile which decreases playability. Then there is the back of the plane with the artifact incrusted back thrusters witch has chest TNT&nbsp;droppers and a piano. Yes a freakin&nbsp;PIANO. This plane is absolutely fantastic.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a must buy. The over-all quality in these two very creative vehicles is off the charts. The playability in this set is great. Just don&#39;t&nbsp;mess with the wings that much. Over-all this is my favorite set of the line and maybe even favorite set in general. A must buy.</p>
