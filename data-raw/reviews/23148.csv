Why? Read below and find out.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is massive, this set is the largest box next to Lord Business&#39; Evil Lair and it shows. Unfortunately like with all of the sets from the first wave this did not include cardboard protection for the manuals, and since stickers are used for detail it&#39;s something to be aware of. I love the image on the front of this box, it really shows off the set nicely and the minifigs as well.</p>

<p>There are Three manuals in this set, each numbered for each build. The first manual is for the fire mech and is a larger&nbsp;square manual, the second is the smaller rectangular design and it is for the Micromanager and the other minifigures. The third cube shaped manual is for the barn copter thing. Each manual is well designed and shows the steps for the builds decently. The third is where you&#39;ll find the piece breakdown, while ads for the other sets are located across all three manuals.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are way too many parts in this set to breakdown into usefulness and not-useful. However I can name several off the top of my head that you may find interesting. Chain piece, hose pieces found on the fire mech, the ladder, air tanks and extra helmets for firefighters, the large brown barrel, windmill pieces, window pieces, red and green apples, a pig and a large number of red and brown/light tan pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You will find five minifigures in this set and one large buildable micromanager, we&#39;ll cover this one in the models section because he is substantially larger just like the one in MetalBeard&#39;s Duel. So let&#39;s start with Lord Business&#39; robotic cannon fodder.</p>

<p>Robo-SWAT: This version has the same torso and leg printing detail as all the rest, and the same weapon accessory. However some new elements are introduced, first off this Robo-SWAT is wearing a knit cap instead of a helmet and a new tactical vest piece. This new piece is a fun looking one, with the SSPE logo on the right breast and the words Super Secret Police Enforcer on back. Honestly I love this new piece, the sculpt work is great and the details can be changed for any Police Theme or other minifigs that LEGO may wish to create. (Can we say UNIT?)</p>

<p>Blaze Firefighter: I&#39;m not sure what is different here from an ordinary LEGO City Firefighter. I believe the print here is, if not identical, than very similar to your standard LEGO City Firefighters. Still he&#39;s a decent enough Minifig for piloting the Fire Fighter Mech, and his expression is nice too with some sweat on his brow and a frown of concentration.</p>

<p>Hank Haystack: This is one of the real stand out minifigs from the set, Hank here will look great next to the LEGO City Farm sets from 2008 or so (if I remember my release dates) and the design just looks great. He has a double-sided torso print with farmer&#39;s coveralls and one strap missing, and his facial print is scruffy with unkempt facial hair and a big open mouth smile showing off the fact he only has two teeth. His hat is a great piece too.</p>

<p>Fabu-Fan: One of the crown jewels of this set is the Minifgure called Fabu-Fan, she&#39;s obviously a TFOL with her curvaceous looking torso print, and her shirt proclaims her to be a fan of Fabuland, one of LEGO&#39;s older Themes aimed at the female fans/collectors. Her facial print is double-sided. One showing a huge open mouth smile showing off her braces while the other is a scared look as she flees from the Micromanager. Her hair piece is the same one used with the CMF Cheerleaders.</p>

<p>Blacktron Fan: Fabu-Fan&#39;s twin brother by the looks of it is a fan of Blacktron, the notorious Space Theme pirates/villains of the early to late 1980&#39;s.&nbsp;Like his sister he&#39;s wearing braces and has a double-sided facial print, with joy and fear being the two emotions. His hairpiece is a familiar one from the CMF series and his torso is just plain fun. A double-sided plaid checkered overshirt with a black tee underneath showing off the Blacktron logo. Both of these Minifigures was a huge draw for this set alongside the awesome builds. Let&#39;s move on to discuss them alright.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Numbered bags for this set, bags 1-3 are used for the fire mech, bag 4-5 is the micromanager and the minifigures that are not associated with any vehicles and bags 6-7 are for the windmill/barn copter thing.</p>

<p>I found the most satisfying build for this set to be the fire mech honestly, this build was solid and less prone to parts falling off compared to the build that makes the barn copter and the micromanager, while a slightly different build compared to the one in MetalBeard&#39;s Duel does share many steps with that build making it a bit repetitive.</p>

<p>Each build being broken up between two to three bags means that you aren&#39;t forced to build everything at once, making it much easier to pick and choose who you tackle first.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Micromanager: This model has a lot of similarities to the one discussed in MetalBeard&#39;s Duel. The legs and arms are built piece for piece identically in design and function although there are some subtle design differences. A third arm is given for holding a weapon of some kind, while the cube is much different as you get two panels that flip open to fire flick-fire missiles. He&#39;s the most armed version of the Micromanager character to date. And can capture minifigs without trouble.</p>

<p>Barn Copter: A helicopter made out of a barn and windmill combination sounds great on paper, and this design is really evocative of the pieces this new Master Builder has used to create the attack craft. However it does suffer a little from the awkward aesthetic of the design. It&#39;s squat and chunky looking with some interesting features.</p>

<p>On one side you can drop a barrel of apples. The other side let&#39;s you load up carrots to make the pig run the engines... Yep this copter is pig powered, don&#39;t ask me how well that works, personally I don&#39;t think it would run fast enough to keep the propeller spinning even if it was trying to get the carrot. You also have two flick-fire missiles under each stubby little wing, and there&#39;s a small anchor on a chain that can be used as a weapon or an anchor. You also have a chicken lookout, really questioning the use of that, unless Hank can speak chicken like a time lord or something. :)</p>

<p>Fire Mech: This is the best model in this set, in my opinion, while the barn copter is loaded with play features and personality, the fire mech is a solid sturdy build that works as a vehicle turned robot build. You can tell this thing has almost all the parts necessary to build an actual fire truck. In fact I&#39;ve seen MOCers try to make it into one.</p>

<p>There are no weapons of any kind with this build, nothing to shoot, fire or launch, however it does have a working fire hose, a quartet of water sprayers that spins, a fist made out of fire hydrants to punch out the micromanagers, accessory storage for fire axes, walkie talkies, a shovel and broom,&nbsp;and spare fire hats and air tanks.&nbsp;It als has&nbsp;sturdy legs for battle poses. You&#39;ll also find a piece with a code on it for the LEGO Movie Video Game... Not sure if it&#39;s for consoles or just pc versions of the game, don&#39;t own it yet to try it out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say this is definitely one of the must own sets from this Theme, perhaps not as huge a priority as the Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!!! but still one you can&#39;t pass up on. There are three great minifigures (with two ok ones), an awesome mecha, and the barn copter while quirky and a bit awkward looking is still great fun, also looks good next to the Creative Ambush bi-plane.</p>

<p>Strongly recommend this set, although if you want to save try and get it on sale at TRU. This set is actually exclusive to them, which is probably why in Canada they charge 10$ over MSRP for it, typical. Oh yes, there are sticker details in this set, so be aware of that as the lack of cardboard protector for the manuals and sticker sheet means you might find one that&#39;s been shoved in and bent/curled or worse.</p>

"MrNobody","2014-12-07T23:30:42.093Z","Set for children, parts for AFOLs","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is usual. We can find three building instructions in it: one for the building steps of the fire mech, one for the micro manager and one for the wild west helicopter.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set includes a lot of cool part. There are nice reddish brown and grey elements in the helicopter, such as a white chicken and a dirty pig which are quite rares. We have&nbsp;a special-printed red tile in the mech.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Well, the minifigures are the best in this set. There is a fire fighter, which isn&#39;t different than in a CITY set and&nbsp;a super secret police robot with a cool vest. We also have a farmer with a nice printed torso and head. But the main attractions are: the Blacktron and the Fabuland fans These minifigures are awesome! The torsos are printed very well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Although you can met a lot of building technics and you use pretty large scale of elements, it&#39;s boring. On the other hand, I&#39;ve found pretty difficult to put the modules of the helicopter together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice model designed mainly for children. It has a large playability. If you are an AFOL, you might buy it because of the parts or the minifigures and animals.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Considering the above&nbsp;mentioned&nbsp;features, I&#39;m happy that this set is the part of my collection.</p>
