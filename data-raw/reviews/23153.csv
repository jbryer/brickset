"Cogez1988","2014-08-02T11:15:11.56Z","So big, but so fun!","<p>This build was a lot of fun, but very complex! The final model has heaps of moving parts and features, and looks really good. The only trouble is finding a place to keep it!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is enormous, wouldn&#39;t fit in my cabin baggage or suitcase on the way home from Sydney! There are three instruction books, and 107 steps.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots and lots of little parts, and lots of stickers too. I had to be really careful not to drop anything.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mini figures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This took me a full day to build. It is really complex, so it&#39;s best to not be tired or distracted! Three times I had to disassemble a substantial part of the model to fix something I&#39;d stuffed up earlier! But overall I had a great time putting it together, and enjoyed the complexity of all the moving parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks amazing! It&#39;s massive, moves in eight different ways, and is fun to play with. It&#39;s pretty heavy too, not much good for &quot;zooming around&quot; but it is good to run through all the functions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a really good model, challenging to build, fun to play with and it looks good too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is very big with attractive design, presenting all functions of main model - The Cargo Plane, and also B-model - Cargo Hovercraft (unusually only on half of the back side).</p>

<p>My set came with one large instruction book, which I think is much better then more smaller books. I hope Lego will make this a thing and next year we will be getting Technic sets with only one book.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lot of parts, most of them white, which is something different than what you expected from pictures. Some new parts eg. 2L alxe pin and 3x11 plate. You also get 5 small LAs, M-motor and battery box. Lot of pins, but not as much as in 42009 - Mobile Crane Mk.II. This set contains huge amount of stickers (2 full A5 sheets), but thats what makes this plane look so great.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None, of course.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun. You start with landing gear construction, which is very interesting and a bit tricky also. Then you continue with the fuselage, gearbox and cockpit. After that you start using most of the blue parts for the tail of the plane. Wings with engines are the last thing to build. Very interesting is solution of the manually operated ailerons and elevators with one joystick. Overall build was fun, pretty long, and complicated just enough for age range of this set (10-16).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Cargo Plane looks awesome! And it is BIG and I really mean it. It is even longer than the 42009 - Mobile Crane Mk.II (which has more than twice parts) PFs are: raise/lower Front and Rear cargo bay, raise/lower landing gear (with covers) and spinning props. Than you have manual elevators, ailerons and flaps.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>One of the most beautiful technic model I have seen in last few years, maybe its because it&#39;s not another yellow construction machine or car/truck. And the B model looks good too, even so good it could probably be stand-alone set, but I will see that when I build it.</p>

"DrFrankenstein","2015-12-19T23:22:48.493Z","Massive airplane","<p>Huge does not begin to describe the size of this plane. Even with its rather short wingspan (relative to the fuselage) this is likely the largest Technic model in terms of area. Not only is it large, but also it looks pretty darn good with a nice white and blue color theme reinforced by a record-breaking number of stickers (around 50 stickers). The airplane sports 6 distinct functions (2 manual and 4 powered).</p>

<p>The first thing that I noticed when I opened the box was that there was one thick instructions booklet, instead of the usual 2-4 booklets for sets of this size. It came in its own sealed bag with two large sticker sheets tucked in. I am not sure if this is the new direction that we we will be seeing in the years to come, but I think it&#39;s a nice change - I never understood anyhow why one would need so many booklets. One thing that has not changed however is the baby-bite-sized steps that the build is broken into in the booklet, which can be annoying at times for experienced builders who have the capacity to handle more complex building steps.</p>

<p>The build took more time and was more challenging than I thought it would be. There are lots of beams and parts that come together at unusual angles and configurations. Assembling the model correctly requires a lot of concentration on the orientation and placement of parts since it is easy to make an error that will require undoing part of the model. One thing that I did not like that much are two steps in the cockpit build, which ask you to force a mini linear actuator open and then closed. The same result can be achieved by keeping the gear box on neutral and turning the gears that drive the actuator by hand with far less wear to the parts (I assume that forcing the actuator open/closed is not good for it). At the end, completing the build leaves a certain sense of epic achievement.</p>

<p>The functions of the model are carefully chosen to illustrate some of the main functional aspects of a real aircraft (a simplified model, of course, but hey, it&#39;s a toy after all). The propellers are powered and geared at a more convincing RPM than the sluggish rotor of the 9396 Helicopter from two years ago. The rear loading bay door also opens and closes more reliably than the one the heli had. So this is an improvement overall. The landing gears mechanism is also very cool with synchronised doors sliding over the retracting rear wheels. The only complaint that I have about the power functions is that it is very hard to open the rear hatch, lift the cabin, or lower the landing gears without forcing the actuators to skip with clicking sound. I believe this is a direct result of the fact that no polarity switch is included with the set and one has to operate the one built in the battery box, which is very imprecise. Another issue worth noticing is the mechanism for the control of the ailerons which utilizes a system of knob wheels. The problem is that the knob wheels near the wing tips tend to catch and it takes some trial and error to adjust them back and forth in a position where the ailerons can be operated without catching (not perfectly smooth, but acceptable).</p>

<p>Overall, I like this model very much and would recommend it to all Technic fans looking for a break from the usual construction machinery we have gotten used to. It is a large-scale model that will exceed your expectations both in size, build complexity, looks, and functions abundance.</p>

"Gazy","2017-09-04T14:48:14.723Z","Awesome set to build and to play","<p>Being a huge Lego fan, this set was my first &quot;Lego technic&quot;.</p>

<p>I hesitated long time before making the move... thinking they are not enough<em> Lego</em></p>

<p>Since I bought this one, I moved to buy more and more technic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was total fun to build. I am still stunned by the inteligence of the set up to have one engine and being able to do so many different things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My kids (4 and 8) love to play with that plane and it is super solid.<br />
I strongly recommend it.</p>

"martiniman","2016-01-13T15:07:07.357Z","Awesome huge airplane with a small sticker problem.","<p>I just reviewed the 42040 and said it was the best looking Technic Plane ever. Now I am puzzled. Is this one taking the lead or not? Is it a tie? It should have been the best looking plane if Lego had ditched the stickers and choose to make 3x11 blue wings. Now I have to put it second. It remains a marvel of technic functionality though!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42025-1.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>We have such a pile of technic, we usually need just a bunch of bricks to assemble a new model that comes out. So lets order the instructions and quite unique half-width 6M white beams and build this!</p>

<p>The instructions are great. Easy to follow, 5-year-old friendly, yet a little useless duplication. Take the side panels: they are exactly the same except for stickers. So the instruction is 2 times there. A little superfluous. You see this a couple of times.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The plane contains TONS of white bricks and panels. There is 13 curved 3x11 panels for example. You also have the idea to receive a lot of blue stuff, but the fact is you don&#39;t. Basically only the tail, the wing tips and the stools are blue.</p>

<p>The rotors of the 42020 now function as propeller blades!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building process is very nice. There is a lot of tech crammed into this plane: it is so much more than a hollow loading bay! There is a gearbox to control 4 functions, 2 steering handles and a ton of very long shafts and many gears.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>We made this as intended, and since we don&#39;t have stickers we ran into a problem: this is one of the very few Technic models that does not look right without stickers. It was white. Very white. Crazy much white. Boring in a way.</p>

<p>So we looked which parts are usually covered in blue stickers, and replaced these with actual blue panels. The result was amazing. The plane became a super-cool looking design, much better than the original sticker version!</p>

<p>The only problem: Lego does not make 3x11 wing panels in blue. Although this is not too bad.</p>

<p>So if you have 3x11 curved and 3x5 wing blue panels from the Crawler Crane, try them on this plane too! It will make it the stunning plane it was used to be!</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The playability is awesome. You get a M-size motor and 5 mini-actuators that control:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Opening of pilot cabin (it is easy to push it back, the small actuators slip easily)</li>
	<li>Opening of the wheel bays (very nice cantilevered folding), 3 actuators used for this</li>
	<li>Opening of the loading ramp on the back</li>
</ul>

<p>To control the flying, there are 2 handles on the tail. One controls elevators on the rear wing and ailerons, the other the flaps for extra lift during takeoff. Missing is a working rudder.</p>

<p>You can also choose to operate the propellers with the motor too. They turn very fast and thus realistic, and LEGO made a very nice coupling to prevent blocking of the propellers. They use a tube element with two friction pins for this on each axle!</p>

<p>Awkward thing is the control of the direction of operation. The battery box is clumsy to reverse, even with the big handle they made to operate it. The gear box is a simple one without direction controls. The crawler crane introduced a new 2 direction design, much needed on models like this too. I hope LEGO will use that design too in models like this.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The plane is huge, it is crammed with playable functions and it looks stunning..... at least if you put on stickers, or even better, if you replace the blue-sticker parts with actual blue parts. LEGO was on a way to create the best Technic Plane ever, yet they were too lazy to put blue plastic in some of the moulds they have lying around.</p>

"camdflage","2019-06-25T01:03:40.03Z","Great actions. Great build","<p>What a kit!</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t stop building this from the moment I opened the box. Great build&nbsp;and design. The designers have really improved their gear switching dynamics over the years. There are multiple motorised options, with the switching mechanism working like a flawless charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technics have really improved their finished kit aesthetics over the years. My first Technics kit was one of Lego&#39;s firsts. It looked skeletal, whereas the Cargo Plane kit looks almost air worthy (kinda). There&#39;s enough room for improvement to fill the gaps, and improve on the existing features/actions, for those little engineers (and big ugly ones like me) to put their own creative stamp on.</p>

<p>Lego would do well to capitalise on their aviation kits, as they now have a number of great models in this size, and could release support vehicle sets to accompany these kits. Aircraft tugs, refuelers, baggage transports, aircraft to terminal buses, catering vans/lifts. The potential is there.</p>

<p>Improvements to be made post build?</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Fill in some of the wing gaps</p>

<p>- Lighting (port, starboard, landing and interior)</p>

<p>- Improve landing gear to close completely</p>

<p>- Close over engine nacelles.</p>

<p>Maybe even add engine start up and running sounds using a small speaker etc?</p>

<p>Lots to fire the imagination.</p>

"HenrikMadsen1987","2023-01-05T15:24:10.333Z","Mediocre build fun to play","<p>The plane is fun to play with, with a lot of functions to play with even for smaller children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, playing with the plane is limited to carry (playing it is flying) and stationary using the functions. After seeing a bunch of boys playing with it, it is very apparent that it is impossible to utilise cockpit and the loading bay as using minifigs and / or utilities as cars and tools is just a mess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is needed to make a bunch of modifications to support play with minifigs etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The assembly is relatively easy however, the manual is at some points hard to interpret which gives a bunch of building mistakes which is hard to rectify (usually it is quite easy in technic).&nbsp;<br />
Unfortunately it is also boring to assemble it, it is hard to pinpoint why, but I usually never grow tired of building anything,&nbsp;which I did here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;- It is awesome to look at !</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If it is not specifically this model with therese set of features you are looking for, I&nbsp;recommend you steering clear of this model.</p>
