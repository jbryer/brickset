She is very nice and goes along quite nicely with the two robot figures from the Getaway Glider set. Almost every piece on her is unique as far as my knowledge, the torso and leg pieces both have original printing. The head piece looks new as well resembling a normal robots head but with makeup which is kinda funny. The hair piece is nice because it has a hole in the top of it that allows you to put a fancy red hat in it which looks cool. she is also armed with a standard blunderbuss type looking weapon to go with the wild west them. Overall i think this is a good figure and is a nice addition for anyone trying to collect the entire series.",FALSE,4,4,3,3,4

<p>With a double-sided torso print of a saloon gal&#39;s typical dress, and a printed sloped brick showing the bottom of said dress it&#39;s all very well done and put together. Her facial print shows a robot who hasn&#39;t quite grasped how to use makeup just yet which adds more to the absurd comedy of the character. Her hairpiece is new and unique, with a special hole in the top where her extra feathered cap fits, we could really see this piece a bit more LEGO.</p>

<p>She comes with the Pirate era rifle as an accessory and probably no stranger to its workings. Overall I&#39;d definitely reccommend this little beauty of a minifig. If you don&#39;t already own one, do yourself a favor and track her down.</p>

Thus, I don&#39;t particularly love the original LEGO Movie series. However, it has some good characters, the first of which is Calamity Drone. Now it&#39;s been way too long since I last watched the LEGO Movie, so I hardly remember this character, but the on-screen relevance has basically nothing to do with the quality of the figure. Before we look at the pieces, it&#39;s interesting to note that this was the last CMF series ever to retail for $2.99.</p>

<p>Both top pieces were new and exclusive to the figure, which I definitely appreciate. The hat sports some intricate moulding, but the hairpiece is easily my favourite part of the entire figure. It is so incredibly detailed, and I wish it would be integrated with other sets. If I&#39;m not mistaking, I believe this is the only time that hairpiece was ever used.</p>

<p>Her head is caste all in a fantastic silver tone that looks, of course, very robotic. There isn&#39;t much to say about it, considering it&#39;s so specific to the figure, but there isn&#39;t anything wrong with that. Of course, there&#39;s no alternate expression, which can be expected.</p>

<p>Her torso kind of aggravates me, because had LEGO removed that tiny sliver of silver from the top, that could&#39;ve been an extremely useful piece. She has some fantastic back torso printing as well, which just adds to my frustration. The silver arms are fitting touches, though.</p>

<p>Her dress has some excellent printing, but since they&#39;re printed to seamlessly match the torso, they aren&#39;t very useful. I still adore the printing going on there, however. Of course, since the new curved dress piece released 5 years later, there&#39;s no printing at the back.</p>

<p>Her rifle accessory is a fitting inclusion, but it isn&#39;t new for the set&nbsp;or anything.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure, and overall, in the context that it&#39;s accurate to the source material, I can&#39;t say anything too bad about it. This figure really comes down to personal preference on if you like these drone CMF&#39;s or not. I personally do not, therefore I don&#39;t really care much about this character, despite having really detailed new hair. I just feel like the torso is a huge missed opportunity to be useful outside the setting, and she just doesn&#39;t feel all too special to me. But again, it&#39;s just a matter of preference.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
