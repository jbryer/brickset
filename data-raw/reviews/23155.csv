A big blocky flat headpiece and the awesome Octan mug are dead giveaways. Considering that he&#39;s only in one other set (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70809-1/Lord-Business-Evil-Lair"">Lord Business&#39; Evil Lair</a>), you&#39;re fortunate to have this minifig.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like all minifig packets, it comes in a concealed bag with the pieces and a small little pamphlet telling you about the awesomeness of The Lego Movie.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>President Business has a killer hairpiece that really isn&#39;t useful anywhere else. I mean, come on - does anyone actually do their hair like that? As for the Octan mug, I have used this in multiple brickfilms and MOC&#39;s. It is a really good piece. One for the collectors.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>President Business only comes in one other set so here&#39;s a good place to get him.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is one of my favorite characters from The Lego Movie and I&#39;m glad to see him in set form without having to drop a few dollars on Lord Business&#39; Evil Lair. Sure, he doesn&#39;t come with the stilts and evil headgear but it&#39;s a minifig worth having.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-10-25T17:53:17.64Z","Everything Must be Perfect!","<p><strong>Set #71004 President Business: </strong>Not much to discuss here folks, it&#39;s the main Antagonist of the movie.</p>

<p>President business brings nothing new to the table from other iterations, the print is identical for his torso and his face is double-sided with an angry grimace on one side and a regular scowl on the other, which I think might be the same expression from Lord Business, though I&#39;m not sure on that. His unique hair piece and octan logo printed coffee mug complete the package.</p>

<p>The only big draw for this one is the cheapest method of obtaining the character back when he was plentiful in early 2014. Now, I don&#39;t think the price for him on the secondary market went up too much, though I could be wrong on that front. Still if you&#39;re looking for some business suits for MOC characters owning multiples never hurts. Mildly reccommended.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-26T21:59:48.82Z","He mean BUSINESS!!!","<p>No LEGO based film has been anywhere near the level of greatness that the original LEGO Movie achieved. Not only did the film have incredible animation, an awesome soundtrack (get it?), and impressive animated on-screen builds, but the characters were unbelievably loveable. If you&#39;re rooting for the villain just as much as the hero, you know it&#39;s an incredibly done film. Thus, the inclusion of President Business in this series, while he remains largely unchanged from the sets, is certainly a worthy inclusion.</p>

<p>On top, we have that crazy hair piece that looks so ridiculous and stupid... in a good way. A great way, really! It makes the figure iconic, and it&#39;s so specific to this character that it isn&#39;t useful, but there is nothing wrong with that, if it&#39;s made for a particular and iconic character. This piece isn&#39;t exclusive to this figure or anything, but this is a pretty cheap way to get it, though it did appear in 70818 one year later for only $14.99 US dollars. At the time this released, however, 70809 was the only set in 2014 to have this iconic piece, and since that set retailed for $69.99, this was vastly the cheapest way to obtain it.</p>

<p>President Business&#39; head print is exclusive, and also very expressive, something of which is faithful to the film. The primary face sports a frustrated frown, but his alternate expression carries an anger-inducing rage-filled scowl. An alternate expression being included at all is something I definitely appreciate, seeing as this was the cheapest way to get this iconic and loveable character. It really is generous of LEGO to include it!</p>

<p>Much like the hair, this torso is an exact reprint of the one found in 70809, but again, that set was loads more expensive than this affordable CMF, so its inclusion here was welcome for the time. It, along with the hair, was reused in 70818, which released a year later for $14.99. This was the cheapest option to get this character, however. Anyway, there is no back torso detailing, unfortunately.</p>

<p>As for his accessory, it may be my favourite part of the figure. It doesn&#39;t look like much, and it honestly isn&#39;t; but it&#39;s super useful. All it has is a simple &quot;Octan&quot; text and logo plastered on the front, which is not only relevant to the film, but it&#39;s highly useful outside the setting for MOC&#39;s or stop-motion animations. It&#39;s a great piece!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure, and overall, I used to strongly despise him because of how similar it was to one found in the set. But now I love it because of how similar it is to the one found in the set. Okay, I can defend both arguments. Argument 1: besides the face and the accessory, he&#39;s literally unchanged from the one found in the sets, which appears very lazy and uninteresting. On the other hand, we have argument 2: this is a fantastic alternative to get this character, versus spending $69.99, and it&#39;s brilliant LEGO released an affordable version of him in a CMF series. See what I mean? It&#39;s all about perspective. Personally, I think LEGO has the lines blurred. I think LEGO saw this as a perfect opportunity to re-release it in a cheap and affordable way, while also saving time and effort into making a new figure. Honestly, I have to give this character a 3 out of 5 because of that.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Sorry if it was long and wordy, but thanks for reading all of it! Hope you enjoyed!</p>
