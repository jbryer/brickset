<p>Emmet Brickowski is dressed in his standard Construction Worker outfit, he includes the double-sided torso print and leg printing we&#39;ve seen on him before as well as a double-sided facial print that is unique to this version. An open mouth smile with open eyes and a closed eyes smiling expression. His hard hat is new and unique to him here, with the extra bonus of having his hair visible poking out from underneath. For accessories he includes a printed tile with the Instructions on it, those wonderful instructions on how to greet the day as seen from the beginning of the film.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say this is a nice addition to the ranks, it&#39;s the cheapest you can get Emmet, he is the main character of the film, the only thing missing is his unique hair piece, but that&#39;s nothing to feel down about, because what is here is more than adequate enough if you just want the character, as he wore this outfit for most of the movie. Recommended.</p>

<h3>Helmet</h3>

<p>His helmet is cute, an interesting hat/hair dual mold, but that restricts its use to only brunette minifigures.</p>

<h3>Head</h3>

<p>This is a dual-sided head. One side is a normal Emmet face with the usual Emmet look. The other side has Emmet looking very happy. However, his ^_^ style eyes do not look so much like Emmet.</p>

<h3>Torso</h3>

<p>Usual Emmet torso (I think), has some very nice reflective strips which are actually shiny!</p>

<h3>Legs</h3>

<p>Emmet comes with nice legs with detailing and a name tag.</p>

<h3>Accessories</h3>

<p>Emmet comes with his &quot;how to be happy&quot; book, which has fine detailing printed onto it. On one panel there is a man getting eaten by a shark but on the side they printed a smiling minifig face and drew an arrow pointing to the man. Clumsy description, I know, but it&#39;s clearer when you see it. I do wish this minifigure had come with the Piece of Resistance, that would have made that piece a lot more accessible to everyone.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a decent figure, but the lack of the Piece of Resistance is a bummer. If you have the normal Emmet figure, then it boils down to... do you like his hat? Or his book? If the answers are both &quot;no&quot;, then you don&#39;t really need this figure.</p>

<p>Hard hat Emmet is a good figure who does a generic variation right .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has the fairly hard to find Emmet dual moulded hair hard hat combo , an excited face and a laughing alternate expression , his torso is a regular Lego movie one Emmet print and the same goes for the legs with a continuation of a high visibility jacket and a name tag .</p>

<p>The aaccessories-&nbsp;</p>

<p>His accessory is a very nice printed instructions on a 1&times;2 yellow tile featuring the hilarious always be happy segment from the film , even when you are being eaten by a shark . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a fun minifig and comes with a cool hard hat and accessory and my only one from this series but I still recommend it .</p>

Other times they can save an otherwise plain presentation. The LEGO Movie is one of the only films that I can honestly say I love and adore every single character. Even rarer, my favourite of all the highly likeable characters has to be either Benny, or the main star himself, Emmet. And obviously, he&#39;s included in the CMF series, however this time with an interesting twist. This released in 2014, where it was the last ever series in the US to retail for $2.99.</p>

<p>I think most people who know of this figure can honestly say that the hair-hat combo is their favourite part. It is dual-moulded, using red and red-brown, and it&#39;s a legitimately useful part outside of the setting. It&#39;s very accurate to the film, and it was made specifically for this CMF.</p>

<p>Even though the head print isn&#39;t very useful from its lack of pupils, I adore the face. Considering just how many Emmet minifigures we got throughout the LEGO Movie theme, I&#39;m very happily surprised to see a new and exclusive print made! Of course I love his chipper, open-mouthed smile, but his alternate expression is superior. That&nbsp;smile is so massive that it&#39;s adorable in every way. Not only do I commemorate LEGO for making a new face print, but I commemorate them for making two!</p>

<p>Since this is standard Emmet, his torso is the same as the one found in the sets. I don&#39;t have problem with that, since this was, surprisingly, the cheapest way to get this character back in the day. So while it isn&#39;t anything exclusive by a long shot, I appreciate its inclusion. It does have back torso printing, which believe it or not, was sort of a rare thing in CMFs released in the early 2010&#39;s. But since this was the same print used in the sets, back printing was incorporated.</p>

<p>His accessory is amazing as well, and it&#39;s super accurate to Emmet&#39;s on-screen instructions. It&#39;s surprisingly useful for customs as well! Dang it, reviewing all these LEGO Movie CMFs puts me in the mood to re-watch the original film.</p>

<p>That is it for this figure, and I honestly love him. He&#39;s adorable, and all his pieces and prints are excellent inclusions. Of course, they&#39;re common, but this was the cheapest way to get those parts. I do wish LEGO had included a plain Emmet hairpiece alongside the helmet, that way&nbsp;this could be the whole deal, but it isn&#39;t really a huge deal, since his hair is so easy to get. Overall, I&#39;m definitely giving this figure a 4 out of 5. Not only is it a nice way to get another copy of this character, but it sports 3 wonderful, exclusive pieces.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
