"shirhac","2014-02-22T13:58:26.82Z","Pretty wild wild west Wyldstyle","<p>This Wild West Wyldstyle may be the cheapest way to get a minifigure of one of the new Lego movie stars. This female minifigure can be identified quite easy with the feel method. Just feel for the sloped brick to narrow it down, then go for the hairpiece, which is unique in this series.</p>

<p>The shoulder joints are firm, not as wobbly as they were found on some minifigs of other series. The hairpiece sits tightly on top of the head. In my opinion the stylish hair piece alone is worth getting the figure. The body can be used in any wild west style setting (or even a victorian/steampunk/dr. whovian).</p>

<p>Only let down in play value is the accessory: a fan is not that cool or even wild in style.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll get the usual 3x4 black brick-stand-tile, which is a nice bonus. All in all it&#39;s one of the best picks of this years minifigure series, I guess.</p>

<p>With a double-sided torso print and a printed slope piece for the lower dress this is your standard Wearing a Dress Female character. What is not standard however is the colour choice used. This dress is mostly all black with some decent purple highlights and a nifty looking skull necklace. There&#39;s even a nice splash of orange on her chest for the small ribbon/bow there.</p>

<p>The Flamenco Dancer Fan accessory is included here, which is screen accurate as she did use that accessory briefly. Overall I would definitely recommend tracking her down if you can, multiples are encouraged if you can swing it too because she has so many uses for other characters. This is just a really winning looking version of Wildstyle and she&#39;s one of my favorites from this series, I&#39;d say top of the list actually.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-29T00:08:24.333Z","Wild at heart!","<p>I do plan on re-watching The LEGO Movie soon, therefore reviewing all these LEGO Movie CMF&#39;s really puts me in the mood. I&#39;m eager to see all the characters from this series that I may otherwise not recall. However, I do recall almost the entirety of the wild west scenes, and believe it or not, I remember seeing Wyldstyle in this outfit, meaning it&#39;s faithful to the film. This figure was released in 2014, where she included 6 pieces and retailed for $2.99, this being the last series to bear that price.</p>

<p>Her hair-piece was, obviously, very easy to obtain back in 2014. Not only was it in this cheap blind bag, but it was scattered throughout most of the sets, since she was one of the lead characters. So, though this is far from exclusive, I like its inclusion here. That part was introduced with the LEGO Movie line in 2014; all the better its inclusion. The moulding on the pony-tail is exquisite, as are the printed highlights.</p>

<p>Since I was but a wee-lad back when this series released, I don&#39;t entirely know for a fact if this head was new for the figure or not. But judging by the rest of the series,&nbsp;I think it&#39;s safe to assume that it was, indeed, exclusive. It&#39;s a fantastic print that I can see hard-core fans of the film loving.</p>

<p>Thanks to the yellow flesh used by most characters in the film, her torso is pretty useful outside the setting for civilian LEGO figures. The orange bow-tie is a great touch, and perhaps this series showed a slight raise in CMF quality, since most in the series, including this, had back torso printing.</p>

<p>Her dress is simply a 2x2 slope with printing. I&#39;ve always found it interesting how older dress-wearing figures attached to the legs using simple studs. I appreciate how it carries the detailing from the torso.</p>

<p>Her accessory was nothing&nbsp;new for the figure. That piece dates back to the Series 6 Flamenco Dancer, though it&#39;s nice to see it accurately implemented here. The moulded detailing there is spectacular.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure, and overall, I don&#39;t really know about this one. Sure, it&#39;s a cheap way to get that hairpiece, but if LEGO was going to include Wyldstyle, I kind of wish they&#39;d gone with her original design instead of an obscure twist that was hardly on-screen. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s awful, but unfortunately, she is my least favourite in this series, and she&#39;s only gonna get a 3 out of 5 from me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
