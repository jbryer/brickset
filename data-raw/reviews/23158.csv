The packaging colour is in a very dark bluish grey colour which is the same as the rest of the Lego movie sets.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The figure itself is made from six pieces in total , comprising plain legs and a single printed torso with a jacket and bow tie printed. The figure also features a slightly serious looking facial expression which looks slightly similar to the waiter figure except the amount of creases appearing on his face.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The main exciting part is the new beard-hat piece which is attached together and becomes a face and hair piece in one. The figure also includes a paper script with writing on as well.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Overall, certainly one of the more desirable figures from the Lego Movie Minifigure collection which is a rare and unique figure and one that will be very handy for historic Mocs.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>My only strong criticism is £2.50 for a small bag and figure is ridiculously high and too much. At £2 the figures were priced about right in my view, but for 50p more, the value is much worse with it laying at almost 50p a piece and for someone trying to buy the whole collection eventually that's a cost increase of £8 to collect them all and that's assuming you don't collect unwanted duplicates on the way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A brilliant figure to collect, but sold at a ridiculous retail cost point.</div>",TRUE,5,5,1,3,2

Although it is nice to have a new unique piece I like the flexibility of having a separate hat and beard.</p>

Fear not, I have been writing them, just haven&#39;t gotten around to posting them. I will be doing that for the end of this year, posting everything I&#39;ve been working on. Now then, the real reason for this review. To discuss The LEGO Movie series of Minifigures.</p>

<p>Starting off we begin with Honest Abe. A Master Builder from The LEGO Movie, this minifigure is a joy to behold. Even if you aren&#39;t from the USA you know the history surrounding this President, what he accomplished, and it&#39;s good to see him in LEGO form. It was also nice to see LEGO give us many characters from the Film not in any of the physical sets.</p>

<p>Abe includes a nice single-sided torso print which will work for any fans of MOCing their own nighttime theater or Broadway show attendees. He includes a single-sided facial print with a no-nonsense expression and an all-in-one hat piece with beard and hair. His accessory is a printed tile with the famous words Four score and seven years ago from Lincoln&#39;s speech addressing the nation. Overall a very well done mini-figure which I strongly recommend tracking down if you missed it when it first came out last year. He fits in quite nicely with the Statue of Liberty and other famous historical minifigs from the CMF line.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-29T00:27:49.53Z","GREAT, to be HONEST!","<p>I understand how controversial it may be, but imagine how epic a minifigure series for US Presidents would be. I would adore getting CMF&#39;s for old presidents, like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, as well as new presidents, like Donald Trump and Joe Biden. The only president we&#39;ve ever got in any CMF series was Abraham Lincoln. At least we got him! Of course, he&nbsp;wasn&#39;t made to represent the real-life Honest Abe, but rather, it&#39;s accurate to The LEGO Movie&#39;s characterisation of Abe. I&#39;ll take it! This CMF released in 2014, where it included 6 pieces, and was part of the last series to be $2.99.</p>

<p>Starting the review, we have that beard-hat combo, which is all one piece. It has some absolutely superb moulding, particularly on the beard. I love the soft curvature of the hat, as well as the remarkably smooth top. It&#39;s all caste in pliable rubber, which is surprising, but understandable, to avoid possible breakage.</p>

<p>The head printing for Abe is not only fitting for this no-nonsense character, but it&#39;s pretty useful outside this setting, thanks to its yellow tone. It has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>The torso is not very detailed, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily need extensive printing. The gold chain hidden inside the jacket is small but noticeable. Unfortunately he lacks back printing.</p>

<p>And since his legs have no printing, we must move on to his 2x2 tile. &quot;Four score and seven years ago&quot; is implemented on the front, and I&#39;m kind of shocked to see its inclusion, but definitely very welcoming. The tan colour used to represent aged paper is a great technique.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m very interested in the world of politics and US history, so this figure is absolutely perfect for me. I could possibly see how this may not be as interesting to non-history people, but for me, the new hair-hat combo makes him absolutely perfect. He&#39;s a solid 5 out of 5 figure for me, and he&#39;s actually my personal favourite of the&nbsp;series.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
