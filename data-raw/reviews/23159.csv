"Odeinoichus","2015-10-17T18:06:35.283Z","Cat Lady!","<p><strong>Set # 71004 Mrs. Scratchen-Post:</strong> A citizen of Bricksberg we know little about, the CMF series for The LEGO Movie included her and one of her cats, Fluffy? Fluffy Junior? Or some other cat? Who can say.</p>

<p>As her name is Mrs. it stands to wonder who Mr. Scartchen-Post might have been or is? Perhaps he passed away, anyway this minifigure has a unique bright pink torso wih a single-sided sweater print, covered in cat hair, considering how many cats she has that makes sense. Even her legs have been printed with cat hair, showing that perhaps she doesn&#39;t take as much pride in her appearance as she ought to, her facial expression is interesting, she seems sad, her hairpiece in grey is unique and nice to see.</p>

<p>The cat accessory is printed as a cute little tabby and nice to see again after the Series 11 Grandma. Overall though I think for kids this might be a weaker offering, she isn&#39;t a well known character, though I suspect she might be slightly popular. Still it&#39;s nice to see more of Bricksberg represented. I recommend her for completists at least, and fans of the film who wish to own every on-screen character shown.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-09-29T22:11:16.947Z","a WORTHY INCLUSION!","<p>The LEGO Movie Series brings us characters from the film that didn&#39;t appear in any sets. While I think some of the choices within this series aren&#39;t great, Mrs. Scratchen-Post is certainly a very fitting character, since she was more relevant in the film&nbsp;than most Bricksburg civilians. This figure was released in 2014 to coincide with The LEGO Movie, and includes 6 pieces. This retailed for $2.99.</p>

<p>The mould used for hair was not new or anything, but getting it in that grey colour was exclusive to this figure, at the time. It isn&#39;t really all that useful outside the setting, considering most elders don&#39;t have long, flowing hair, but its inclusion is appreciated. I really like that piece, so I don&#39;t mind getting it in various colours.</p>

<p>Her face is somewhat frightened, and I don&#39;t perfectly recall her from the film, so I don&#39;t know how accurate it is. It isn&#39;t very usable outside the setting, but since it was made for this specific character, I can excuse it.</p>

<p>Her torso is also very accurate to the film. Not only do I dig the cat face, but the green pouch is a nice touch. Though some may find it agitating, I really like the miniscule cat hairs littering her body, though fur on the sides of the arms would&#39;ve been great. No back printing, but it&#39;d be covered by the hair anyway.</p>

<p>Finishing off the base of the figure itself are those sand blue legs. The fur does slightly agitate me in this case, since legs in that colour could&#39;ve been highly useful outside the setting.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have her orange cat, which is, of course, accurate to the film. I do wish two cats could&#39;ve been included at least, but this was a relatively new piece back then, so it was no doubt expensive to produce. This was not a new piece, but it was the first time we ever got it caste in orange. I absolutely adore getting it in that colour, as it reminds me a lot of my own furry, orange, tabby feline. The markings on its sides are superb, as is the small patch of fur on the chest.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this character, and overall, this was one of the more memorable civilians in Bricksburg in The LEGO Movie, so its inclusion with the series is fantastic. I personally love the detailing of the actual CMF as well, particularly the hair and the cat. This has to be a 4 out of 5 for me!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
