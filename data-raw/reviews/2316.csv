"legolander","2007-05-10T04:14:00.12Z","Good, but not good enough...","This is again one of my Harry Potter sets. I think it's a little boring because the only thing that made this set look good is the table for dueling, which has 2 trapdoors; i for each student. Plus, this set comes with 4 minifigs. I think that of all medium-sized LEGO boxes, this has the most number of minifigures. The Great Hall is okay but then, it's a little dull. I think I'll give this set 3 stars.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2007-08-07T00:07:34.787Z","capesz!","this set is pretty good but the tipping mechanis does not work very well, though they are actually trapdoors which i put in my castle! it comes with a very strange glow in the dark head and body, 3 capes (thats how this thing got a 4), and to hogwarts banners.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-19T00:11:50.34Z","pretty good","this set is ok lots of good peices though. i like the throne and banners, and yet again, lego fails to make a solidwall i mean theres a giant beam across the middle of the room at head hight might want to look out! any way the dueling floor is great and works well. the building is ok and this set is not to bad i like it",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mngoult","2009-11-02T16:38:22.983Z","Not bad for Harry Potter","First things first, I'm not a massive fan of the Harry Potter theme. There are too many missing walls and cobwebs in most of the sets for my liking.

This set is now one of only three HP sets I still have due to high levels of playability and the fact it fits togther nicely with 4709 and 4730. 

The dueling platform is a nice idea if not executed perfectly, the main chamber looks nice and is fairly solid. The four minifgs is a massive bonus for a set this small and for once are all relevent to the set.

The throne is nice although not sure how it fits in with the book or the film, overall a very solid 4 with the following pros and cons.

Pros
-Four minifigs
-A decent idea with the dueling platform
-Lots of spare wands

Cons
-Missing walls (get used to it in HP sets)
-The weird bit at the top where the owl sits looks out of place

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-29T11:18:12.133Z","LEGO Harry Potter - The Dueling Club Review","This is a set which I've picked up on a vacation. The set is nice to build and very sturdy. This set is part of the movie ""Harry Potter - Chamber of Secrets"" when Harry Potter was fighting Draco Malfoy. The floor where the two students are fighting had a purple carpet but in this set the floor has a dark gray color. The other 'building' which we get is part of the hogwarts castle. This building has two stickers for the flags but we get some nice pieces which you can use for MOC's or brickfilms. I also like the seat where the teacher sits.<br><br>We get Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy and Severus Snape which are nothing special. The only special minifig is Gilderoy Lockhart. Lockhart comes with a green suit and a green cape and he's only included in two sets. The other set where we can find this teacher is in the Chamber of Secrets set (set 4730).<br><br>All
in all this set is a great model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full galery I made for this set

"LegoAdventures","2011-01-22T04:37:55.233Z","The Dueling Club","What an Exquisite set!. In my opinion I think this is a Superb rendition of the Dueling Club in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</span>, and I think Lego did an Outstanding job of the Mini-figures and features that are in this set, it looks wonderful. Released in 2002 to Coincide with the Blockbuster release of Harry potter and the Chamber of Secrets it contains 129 Pieces, 4 sumptuous Mini-figures, A small section of the Great Hall in which Professor <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gilderoy Lockhart</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Severus Snape</span> watch over Harry and Draco and a small Platform for Harry and Draco that has a launching mechanism that launches them backwards.<br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions: </h4><br>The Box is 28.5cm Long, 19cm Tall and 5.5cm Thick. The Box features all of its usual offerings and features like the Red Lego Insignia. Around all the sides, back and a border around the front of the Box is decorated with the Stone walls in Hogwarts, a feature that all Harry Potter and the<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Philosophers Stone </span>and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Chamber of Secrets</span> Boxes have. On the back of the Box there is 2 Alternative images that you can Build from LEGO.com, however i don't think the Link is there anymore. There is also an image of most of the Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secret sets, another feature that is common on most of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Philosophers Stone</span> and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Chamber of Secret</span> Boxes. There is numerous images of various angles of the set and Mini-figures around the sides, and last but not least where the Components are made, for this particular set everything from the Box, Packaging and Pieces are all made In Denmark. That's what I love about Lego is that It's Quality European Manufactured. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>Inside the Box there is 3 Plastic Bags that are not numbered, so the Building Experience may take longer and be a bit more challenging. There is also 2 Beige Pillars, 1 Large Dark Grey Base plate and 1, 1x16 Light Grey long Lego piece, these pieces are not in bags. There is unfortunately a Sticker Sheet that has a sticker Sheet of Blue Flags with the Various Hogwarts House Animals: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gryffindor</span> - Lion, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Ravenclaw</span> - Eagle, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hufflepuff</span> - Badger, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Slytherin</span> - Serpent but at least it's only 2. There is also last but not least the 24 Page Instruction Booklet which does not feature Illustrations at the back of the Booklet, however does feature the same image of some of the Philosophers Stone and Chamber of Secrets sets found on most Boxes, Pamphlets and back of Instructions on the very back page. <br><br><h4>Mini-figs: </h4><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Professor Gilderoy Lockhart: </span>Lockhart is a stupendous Mini-figure. He features Blond styled wavy Hair. He features high raised Blond eyebrows, Vainglorious expressions like his Sparkling Black Eyes and large smiling mouth with very White Teeth and large Black smiling marks and Cheek lines next to his mouth. His Torso is Elegant and Dandified. It features a lovely Emerald Green Suit with a Emerald Green Vest. The Vest features a lovely Metallic Gold Vine pattern which has little Gold leaves coming of the stalk. Around his Neck he has some sort of White Tie or Formal accessory. Last but not least he Features an Emerald Green Cape, resembling his Robes, and Emerald Green Pants.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Professor Severous Snape:</span> Snape features Greasy Oily long Jet Black Hair. He also features a Glow in the Dark Head that has suspiciously raised Black eyebrows, An eye that seems to be Twitching or giving someone the evil sly death look and the other eye slightly more opened than the other eye, though still looking evil and curious. He also features a very strange puzzled type of angry mouth. His Torso features a Dark Purple Suit that is outlined in Silver. He features Grey hands to match his Grey Glow in the Dark head, Black pants with a Dark Purple pattern on his pants with the Silver outline (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Identical to the pattern on his Torso</span>) and a Black Cape resembling his Robes. (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Although Snapes Mini-fig and character give an Evil and Sly perspective he is actually a very admirable and almost sad character. I will not tell you why because that would Spoil the Series, However for people who have read the Books and do know what i mean i hope others who haven't read the Book find more about Snapes character trust me after you find out more you your perspective might change, Mine certainly did</span>)<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Harry James Potter:</span> Harry features his usual Black Messy Hair with Red Scar, Circular Glasses, Brave Sparkling Black eyes, and simple smile. His Torso features Light Grey Hogwarts School Uniform that features a Light Grey V Neck Sweater with Stitching around the Neck, Gold and Crimson Red lacing around the Neck, White curved Collar and Gold and Crimson Red Tie. On the Sweater there is a Gold and Crimson Red Badge with a Gryffindor Lion. He also features various stitching around the bottom of the sweater and various Black lines around his waist resembling how Mischievous, Active and adventurous he is that he can't keep his uniform tidy. And last of all he features Light Grey pants and a Black Cape (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Which on one side is pure Black and on the other side has Silver Stars</span>) resembling his Robes. Harry also features a Chestnut Brown Wand.<br><br style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Draco Lucius Malfoy: </span>Draco features his Combed Blond Hair, Grumpy and Mean looking face with raised Blond eyebrows, Suspicious Black Eyes and Disgusted sort of Quirky Mouth. His Torso features Light Grey Hogwarts School Uniform that features a Light Grey V Neck Sweater with stitching around the Neck, Emerald Green and Silver lacing around the Neck, White curved Collar and Emerald Green and Silver Tie. On the Sweater there is a Emerald Green Badge that has a Silver Serpent on it. He also features various stitching around the bottom of his sweater and various Black lines around his waist resembling how Mischievous and Sly he is that he can't keep his uniform tidy. And last of all he features Light Grey pants and a Black Cape (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Which on one side is pure Black and on the other side has Silver Stars</span>) resembling his Robes. Draco also features a Black Wand.<br><br><h4>Dueling Table Mechanism:</h4><br>You start of by Building a small Square with various Dark Grey pieces and a small formation that has a Triangular Lego piece with a hole in the middle. You place 2 Technic Lift-arm Beams next to each other and put a Long Dark Grey Technic Axle (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">When looking at the front has a + looking shape</span>) through the 2 Technic Lift-arm Beams and attach it to the Triangular Lego Piece that has a hole in the middle of it. (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sorry if that was hard to understand, however if you didn't understand simply go to Peeron.com, search 4733 in the Search tab, then scroll down and you should see the piece's that I'm describing or Download the Instructions for Brickset.com or Peeron.com</span>) The Mechanism of these pieces enable you to move the Technic Lift-arm Beams up and down which will so become a part of the launching Mechanism that will launch Draco or Harry. You then cover the Square by putting a Lego Trapdoor piece over the Mechanism that i described earlier. And you then place a Flat Light Grey Lego piece that has no Studs so the Mini-fig can't grip onto it. You now have a completely sealed Square with the hidden Mechanism and Trapdoor type piece on top. Because you put the Dark Grey Technic Axle through the hole of the Triangular Lego piece you then attach a Sand Green Cylindrical Lego piece to the Stud that is on top of the Technic Axle. Now you should be able to Turn the Sand Green Cylindrical piece which will push the Technic Lift-arm up and cause the Trap-Door Floor to move up as well, and because you place the Mini-fig on the Flat Lego piece that has no grip it launches back depending on your Speed when you turn the Sand Green Cylindrical piece. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm really sorry if that was hard to understand however i tried my best to explain it, and as i said earlier if you didn't understand it simply go to Brickset.com or Peeron.com </span>and download the Instructions for a better understanding of what i mean. You then simply repeat this step again and then connect them both via 2 Tubes that connect into 2 holes, keeping it firmly in place. <br><br><h4>Viewing section:</h4><br>You then Build a section for the Teachers to spectate. You start off with a Dark Grey Base plate that has a turn table type Lego piece on the ground and 4 Light Grey Flat Lego pieces around the edges of the turn table which will soon enable you to place a Throne that will be able to spin smoothly. You also place 4 Light Grey Long wall type pieces at the back. You then place a small printed map type Lego piece which has various details like a Moon, Half Moon, Star, Goblet and Cauldron on a old Brownish warn parchment paper which is on a Sand Green Background. You then Build a Beautiful Throne chair for a Teacher to sit in (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">With the exception that the Mini-figs cape will get bent</span>). The Throne consists of Sand Green, Tan and Beige pieces and has an attachment for a Black Snake/Serpent to stay which I'm guessing is for the part when Draco produces the spell Serpensortia which Conjures a serpent from the Spell casters wand. You then place the large 1x16 Light Grey piece for added structure and strength for the 4 Brick high Beige structures and 2 attachments that hold 1 Trans-Neon Orange flame piece each. You also place 2 Beige Lion head pieces and a another Light Grey 1x16 piece which makes it look neat and compact. Near the Throne you place a Chestnut Barrel piece which has a Beige Wand and a Mild Grey Wand. You then place the 2 Large Beige Pillars and some more beige sloped pieces on top of the Light Grey 1x16 piece. You then place a Dark Grey piece on top of the Sloped Beige pieces that has 1 Stud on top so you can place a Brown Owl on top to finish it off. You then place 2 Dark Grey floor pieces that attach to the Pillars and 1x16 Grey piece. And last but not least you place the Sticker's on 1 Long Yellow piece each, that is attached to 2 Black connector pieces that allow the Flags to hang above the Pillars. <br><br><h4>Overall:</h4><br>This set is a wonderful addition to anyone's Lego Collection or Harry Potter Collection, and i strongly recommend it to anyone with full confidence that you will enjoy it. A truly lovely set 5/5!<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review :)",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
