<p>Scribble-Face Bad Cop isn&#39;t much, his print is the same as the minifigure found in regular sets, and his accessories include a pair of handcuffs (did he even use those in the movie?) and a printed tile iPhone (why?) which I believe he did use to communicate with Lord Business in the movie. The only thing different from this minifigure is the head print. One side features a frowning Bad Cop and the other his Good Cop scribble-face from using the marker to re-draw it.</p>

<p>Honestly, this is an ok Minifig, it&#39;s pretty good for parts since he does include the unique motorcycle cop helmet and this is the cheapest method of getting multiples. If you want to complete the series you&#39;ll need this figure, recommended for fans of the character mostly or for MOC fans looking for that helmet piece.</p>

<h3>Helmet&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Quite a nice design. Black and white mixture is decent, though personally I would have preferred an all black design.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Head</h3>

<p>Kinda why I got this figure. On one side you have the typical Bad Cop face, on the other side is the awesome scribble Good Cop face!</p>

<h3>Torso</h3>

<p>The torso is okay, standard Bad Cop torso. Would work as generic police officer torso too.</p>

<h3>Legs</h3>

<p>Meh. Plain black legs. Nothing too excellent and nothing too terrible.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Accessories</h3>

<p>This comes with handcuffs and a cool printed smartphone. On him these look &quot;meh&quot;, for other figures they look awesome! I love the smartphone 1x2 tile!</p>

<h3>Price</h3>

<p>The price is okay, usual collectible minifigure price. It is a little on the pricey side, however.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re a fan of TLM, get this minifig! He&#39;s pretty awesome!</p>

If you&#39;ve seen the film, you know that President Business permanently erased Bad Cop&#39;s good side. Towards the end of the film, however, Bad Cop used a sharpie to make his own happy side, thus this Scribble-Face Bad Cop was created. This character did appear in a few of the sets based off The LEGO Movie, but this CMF is the only one to have the scribble-face print. This was released in 2014, where it included 6 pieces, and retailed for $2.99.</p>

<p>His black and white helmet was made specifically for this character, though it wasn&#39;t exclusive to this series. Its inclusion here makes for an easy way to obtain the part.</p>

<p>Of course, the draw for this CMF is the head print, and a minifigure series is the perfect opportunity to include it, so obviously it&#39;s great to see it implemented here. It looks very accurate to the film, and it&#39;s horrifying, yet adorable simultaneously. This figure also sports the original Bad Cop face as well, however I believe this expression for the character is exclusive! It&#39;s very useful outside the setting for generic police minifigures.</p>

<p>The torso print is identical to the one found in the sets, though its inclusion here is highly appreciated, since this does make for an easy opportunity to obtain it. It&#39;s useful for any policeman figure, but it lacks back printing, sadly.</p>

<p>Since the legs have no printing whatsoever, we&#39;ll move on to his accessories, and&nbsp;I got to&nbsp;say, I adore them! The handcuffs aren&#39;t anything special, though the inclusion is very fitting. That phone, however, is excellent! Since it has extra widgets beside the home button, my tech-obsessed mind would guess this is not an iPhone print, but rather an Android or Samsung. Nonetheless, that is an incredibly useful printed tile, and the many individual icons are super intricate and appreciated. I love phones printed in LEGO!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure and overall, Bad Cop&#39;s scribble face is something fans would be desperate to get, had this figure not been made. But since it was, I love it. Not only is it a very cheap way to get the character, useful prints and all, but it puts an accurate twist on the figure that is definitely welcome and fitting. Plus, the phone is worth the whole figure! Overall, this is 5 out of 5 stars for me.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading, I appreciate it!</p>

I hadn&#39;t seen<em> The LEGO Movie</em> just yet at that time, but I still found his scribble face very useful. Unfortunately, the print chipped off over time. Still, the other side of the face is useful not just for Bad Cop, but for any policeman(or even other figures).</p>

<p>As for the accessories, I don&#39;t really care, in fact I&#39;m tired of handcuffs, but I love that phone! Ever since the day I got this figure, which was six years ago, I have used it as an accessory in my LEGO house. That phone is beautiful!</p>

<p>All in all, this unique variant of Bad Cop is worth picking up if you find it at a reasonable price. I very much appreciate the inclusion of the phone, which was in the movie for like a split second :)</p>
