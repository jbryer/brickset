<p>As another on-screen character it&#39;s nice to see him included, it was a bit of a shame that LEGO chose to make only one series for the film. Perhaps we&#39;ll see a second series when the sequel comes out. Bill has some impressive printing. He includes a single-sided torso with a nice looking old world shirt. Including the ruffled neck piece from the Actor minifigure and some pantaloon printing on his legs, his head piece is the same as the Actor as well if I&#39;m not mistaken, a good re-use of parts. His accessories include a printed tile with the famous words in LEGO form and a small feather commonly used for hat accessories as a quill.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m impressed with the level of detail in this figure, and the fact that it is a real world character in LEGO form. It&#39;s a shame LEGO did not also give us the Michelangelo from the film, as it would have been nice to see the trio of historical characters in minifig form. A great figure, recommended.</p>

Though it was unbelievably enjoyable and fun, Shakespeare&#39;s intense writing can be difficult to memorise, which goes to show how talented he is. William Shakespeare has hit the big screen numerous times, including a surprise appearance in 2014&#39;s The LEGO Movie. Shockingly, he was implemented in the CMF series that released alongside it! This William Shakespeare figure includes 7 pieces, where he was part of the last minifigure series to retail for $2.99.</p>

<p>On top of the figure is that smooth-top that is controversially inconsistent with other bald minifigures. A blank stud is often used to convey baldness, but every once in a while, a smooth top will be implemented, thus the case here. That piece was new for the figure, and the printed hair at the sides and around the back is exquisite.</p>

<p>The face print here, funny enough, reminds me a lot of the Series 8 Thesbian, where it looks a bit confused, or maybe he&#39;s questioning what to write next. He has no alternate expression.</p>

<p>His fluffy colour piece was not new for the figure, but it&#39;s an excellent inclusion that not only fits William Shakespeare, but it&#39;s accurate to the film. The moulding around the rim of that part is impressive!</p>

<p>His torso is surprisingly intricate! Individual golden-trimmed leaves decorate the chest, and a gold band adjourns the bottom. He lacks back printing, unfortunately, which most CMF&#39;s back then lacked.</p>

<p>Finishing off the base of the figure are his legs, which have some really impressive printing, for the time. The red and gold are not only printed on the front, but also the sides, and it matches up so seamlessly that it appears dual-moulded at first glance.</p>

<p>Lastly, his accessories are pretty good. Not only does he have a white feather quill to ink out quotes, but he has a 2x2 scroll tile that reads &quot;To build... or not to build.&quot;</p>

<p>Overall, I do think this is somewhat of an odd inclusion with the series, however I love Shakespeare, so I dig this figure. The new hair-head combo is brilliant, as are all the incredibly detailed prints. 4 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
