But like the majority, she doesn&#39;t seem to notice him that much.</span></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, not a bad little figure. This was the last figure that I acquired, of the 16, and despite the drill accessory being the obvious clue for those who feel the packets, the give away in my case was the helmet. None of the photos of the figure reveal that she has a ponytail, which makes it easy to identify.</p>

<p>Her torso is clearly dressed differently to that of Emmet, but for those who want to make their own army of construction workers, please note that she has a clearly female body, complete with the side markings that denote the hourglass. Likewise, it has detail on the back too.</p>

<p>The legs are also decorated with waist belt and loose hanging toolbelt.</p>

<p>Her head only has one face, and it shows a keen, determined smile with freckles and even a few &quot;dirt&quot; marks. She is one gal who loves her job.</p>

<p>The helmet is another clever example of 2 head pieces merged together. It certainly looks like 2 pieces put together, for the red helmet has a more glossy finish. Now, if only Lego could do this with all hats, and use different hair colours.</p>

<p>Gail is a great addition to the Bricksberg collection, she includes a unique construction hat with ponytail hair, a double-sided torso print with the standard&nbsp;LEGO Construction vest and a female shape, her curves are represented on both sides. Her legs include a lot more printing with a belt for tools strapped to her leg, which as an odd placement for it. Her face has some scratches on it, freckles and a smiling expression. She comes with the jackhammer accessory.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend trying to pick up more than one of her, she has a lot of useful parts to better diversify your LEGO Construction teams, and as she is one of the more prominent workers from the opening scene of the movie you&#39;ll definitely not want to miss out on her.</p>

Most of the workers don&#39;t stand out, which is ironic, considering the plot of the film. However, Gail was one of the exceptions, and she was perhaps the most-seen construction worker, besides Emmet. This figure was released in 2014 to coincide with The LEGO Movie, she includes 5 pieces, and was part of the last series to cost $2.99.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of this character is undoubtedly the hair-helmet combo, which is coloured dark brown and red. Unfortunately I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s dual-moulded or printed, but it looks great, no matter. It did not stay exclusive by any means whatsoever, and its actually been used in numerous City sets since then. I commemorate LEGO for making a new piece with this figure, however.</p>

<p>Her head print is pretty useful outside this setting, thanks to her small scuff-marks. She doesn&#39;t have an alternate expression, but that&#39;s alright; the front is suitable.</p>

<p>Her torso was yet another new print for the figure, and it&#39;s pretty useful, though hard to differentiate out of a stack of LEGO City&nbsp;construction suits. Something I do adore about this CMF is her back printing, which was not too common back in the day.</p>

<p>Honestly, her legs may be my favourite part of the figure! The strap full of tools is such a useful print, as is the brown belt. I wish it carried onto the sides, but maybe I&#39;m asking for too much.</p>

<p>Her accessory is incredibly underwhelming, but at least one is included.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a pretty great inclusion with the series, since she was perhaps the most relevant Bricksburg construction worker. She has good prints and parts, all of which are very well-done. My only issue with her is just how similar she looks to LEGO City figures, which is purposeful in the context of the film, but not so successful here. I&#39;m still gonna give her a generous 4 out of 5, because she&#39;s a good inclusion, and her pieces are great.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
