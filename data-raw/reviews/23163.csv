<p>His name is Larry. He is a barista, and he is also a hero to any and all who work in the food and beverage industry, especially those who are employed by one of several multinational corporations that continue to deliver standardised food to people around the world. Yes, Larry is a cog in a machine, and although his overall contributions to the world at large appear to be nothing more than being a purveyor of $37 coffee, there is one quality that he has no shortage of: irony.</p>

<p>I want you to take a close look at Larry. Take a glance right now. That unique stubble-strewn face print and that uniquely sloppy parting serve as a frame for an expression that says it all: I don&#39;t give a brick. Yet he wears a badge with a hideously friendly-looking cup of coffee emblazoned on it and holds up a unique cup piece with the same trite symbol printed on it. Larry offers happiness, but makes no pretense about having any himself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is this sense of irony, dilemma, and contradiction that sits at the heart of <em>The LEGO Movie</em> and the message it seems to give: on the one hand, the film preaches against the evils of corporate conformity, yet the movie itself is a marriage among numerous megacorporations. The hipster within all of us would like to reject mass-marketed consumerism in favour of individual morality and creativity, yet it is nearly impossible to deny the sheer amount of comforts that we owe to precisely that. At the same time, to give in completely to in-the-moment materialism is a philosophy that most of us would emphatically reject, all while we remain surrounded by material comfort. Is it wrong to buy products from corporations that act in morally reprehensible ways? How much responsibility do we bear as individuals for simply buying something that we like, or even need?&nbsp;</p>

<p>So many questions, so many schools of thought--and Larry rejects all of them. He has seen all knowledge but has come away none the wiser, and so, like the Buddha, he embraces and breathes contradiction as a way to enlightenment: he serves within a universe of corporate conformity while rejecting it outright at the same time. This, to me, is what Larry represents, and that&#39;s an ideal that transcends all boundaries. And that&#39;s why I bought him first.</p>

<p>But, if that&#39;s too heavy for you, here&#39;s a little MOC I did instead. You&#39;ll need Larry to make it work. I&#39;ll let you decide what that&#39;s worth to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Larry is a great looking minifugre, with a fun looking printing job for his apron, which carries down to the print on his legs, his nametag and pouch with order taking pad for waiting on tables. Larry&#39;s hair piece is brand new and impressively sculpted, it&#39;s a nice dark brown colour and could use some other colours in future for even more MOC potential. His accessory is a nice looking coffee cup, a take-out cup commonly found at places like Starbucks or Tim Hortons (For you Canadians.)</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a great addition from the CMF of The LEGO Movie, a character I wasn&#39;t expecting and some great new pieces for MOC fans, so buy multiples if you can. Recommended.</p>

"tkettle9719","2014-06-25T21:05:26.947Z","Collectable Minifigures 71004: Larry the Barista REVIEW","<p>One of the more fond scenes in &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot; was towards the beginning of the film, where Emmet completes his routine rounds with watching &quot;Where Are My Pants?&quot;, getting dressed, and getting his cup of Joe, just like everyone else he works with. It is in that scene where Larry the Barista makes his appearance and, while really not a particularly amazing minifigure in his own right, Larry the Barista is an essential part of the film; he helps to fuel the unimaginative, lifeless Emmet in his dull, materialistic, and essentially trite lifestyle that society frequently places upon him. Larry, in the film, is a very important aspect of &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;&#39;s development. Aside from the movie, however, Larry the Barista is a well-designed minifigure that definitely screams &quot; STEREOTYPICAL COFFEE SHOP WORKER!&quot; when built.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Pros</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Many of the people who work in coffee shops happen to be either in or graduated from university, so they tend to be young adult workers. This stereotype is well-represented here with the longer hairpiece (which I think would go great for Eleventh Doctor creations) and the more-than-stubbly facial hair. Well thought out in terms of age.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The cup piece is a useful piece for many Lego cities; it&#39;s unfortunate that this is one of, if not&nbsp;<em>the</em>, only sets in which this piece is contained; this could go very well with a coffee shop MOC, and would work well for normal citizens just walking down the city.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>In the actual movie, Larry seems to only have the stubbly beard on his face; while only a minor niggle, this rendition of Larry contains sideburns of some sort. It makes little difference either way (although I do prefer him with the sideburns), but it is an interesting difference.</li>
	<li>The lack of back printing here is a slight disappointment; most aprons like the one Larry wields often have a back strap so that the weight of the apron is not on the neck; a small amount of back printing here would have been greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Larry the Barista is not an exceptional minifigure; he&#39;s actually rather bland and a bit uninteresting. Yet, isn&#39;t that the point of this figure? He&#39;s the average Joe (no pun intended), the regular, likely recent college graduate, kind of guy. And that&#39;s okay. Here, an important theme of &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot; is represented in a nice form, and helps to realize the world of the film in fine form. Although it isn&#39;t the best minifig of the lot, it is worth having in order to make your collection for this great movie.&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-01T16:47:41.49Z","two new parts?!","<p>Even LEGO minifigures at Bricksburg need coffee, and Larry the Barista has them covered. He was released in 2014 to coincide with the film, included 5 pieces, and was part of the last series to retail for $2.99.</p>

<p>His hair piece was made specifically for this character, though it has been reused numerous times since then. It&#39;s great to have it implemented here, and it&#39;s caste in dark brown, which is a useful tone. I love how LEGO went above and beyond to make a new hairpiece for this character!</p>

<p>The facial expression here is fantastic, and highly usable outside this character. The stubble surrounding his awkward frown is accurate to the film, but he has no alternate expression, sadly.</p>

<p>The torso is spectacular, and it&#39;s basically been reused in future sets, with slight variations. The &quot;Larry&quot; nametag&nbsp;makes it a little unusable outside the figure, but since the torso was made for this specific character, I can excuse it. He severely lacks back printing, however.</p>

<p>The unlikely colour combination of sand blue and dark brown is gorgeous on his legs; It just looks a little gappy at the sides.</p>

<p>Accessory-wise, he has yet another piece that was made exclusively for this character: the coffee cup. It&#39;s been reused numerous times since then, but it&#39;s very impressive that LEGO made two new parts for this figure. I love the mould work surrounding the lid, and the rim, and the eerily happy logo on the front is downright adorable.</p>

<p>Overall, the fact that there are two new pieces made for this CMF is highly appreciated, and all his prints are somewhat usable. Plus, since he was one of the most seen Bricksburg characters, his inclusion is excellent. 5 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
