<p>Velma Staplebot introduced a brand new beehive hairdo head piece which hasn&#39;t seen much use, this is the only way to get it in light brown and the Spider Lady includes a printed version in black with spooky spider in the hair. It&#39;s a piece we need to see more of, in numerous colours. Her torso is single-sided with a regular torso, there are no typical curves found on standard female characters. She&#39;s wearing a sweater and a shirt underneath, plus a belt on her waist. Her leg printing is very limited with a hint of a skirt revealing the robot&#39;s knees.</p>

<p>For an accessory she has a printed tile with the super secret taco Tuesday plans. Overall this is an interesting minifig and a blink and you&#39;ll miss her character from the movie. Getting her here is a welcome addition and her hairpiece has all kinds of uses for MOCs. Recommended if you can still find her.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-02T14:33:56.23Z","new HAIR-PIECE!","<p>The LEGO Movie Series has a few choices that I probably would&#39;ve cut, and all the robotic drones fall in that category. Wiley Fusebot and Calamity Drone certainly should not have been included; however I may be able to excuse Velma Staplebot, seeing as she was part of Presiden Business&#39; inside-group, involved in the Taco Tuesday scheme. Velma Staplebot was released as a CMF in 2014 to coincide with the LEGO Movie, she included 5 pieces, and was part of the last series to cost $2.99.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, my favourite part of the figure is the hair piece that was made specifically for this character, although it has been utilised several times since. The moulding on that piece is astounding! I adore how it hangs down over the front of her head, and the beehive-like design at the back looks incredible. This has to be one of my favourite LEGO hair-pieces ever made!</p>

<p>Her head print is, of course, robotic, which isn&#39;t a bad thing at all! I love the microphone over her mouth, as well as the red lipstick. Of course she has no alternate face printing.</p>

<p>I quite love the torso! Since it has no robotic surfaces showing, it&#39;s super useful for custom figures! I dig the dark yellow tone used, but she lacks back printing, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The legs do have some nice silver highlights, but they&#39;re nothing too interesting.</p>

<p>Her accessory is a 2x2 tile that resembles a clipboard and reads: Super Secret Plan: &quot;TACO TUESDAY.&quot; I appreciate how relevant it is to the plot of the movie, though I do think it looks odd printed on a tile.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#39;t particularly love the robotic drones of this series... except this one. The hairpiece is absolutely phenomenal, as is the torso printing. This has got to be one of my favourites in the series, and overall, she scores a 5 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
