Guy and the Getaway Glider. &nbsp;I managed to feel which minifig this was by feeling for the plate he carries(Not a new piece) and feeling the hat to confirm(Feels like it look, pointy top, wide brim)</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><div>It comes in the standard minifigure bag, this time in a dark blue, with the Lego Movie logo in the corner a sampling of the 16 figs shown on the front. &nbsp;There are no instructions, just the mini-poster. &nbsp;However, on the back, instead of showing how to put the figs together, it has an ad for an app.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>This fig has some FANTASTIC parts. &nbsp;THe legs and torso are alright, but the ponchos, hat and plate are awesome! &nbsp;The plate has a pattern printed around the edges with some chili peppers printed in the middle. &nbsp;The hat really looks like a sombrero, with the green/yellow printing around the sides. &nbsp;The ponchos are the same as the 2 included with the Series 2 mariachi band guy, but slightly different print. &nbsp;The face has a mustache and one of his eyes is winking. &nbsp;It also includes 2 1x1 yellow tiles, presumably to represent tacos.</div><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: bold; "">Minifigures</span></p><p>From what I can understand, based on the Essential Guide to the Lego Movie my brother bought yesterday, Taco Tuesday Guy is shown on TV every Tuesday, as well as handing out free tacos. &nbsp;Taco Tuesday also has something to do with President Buisness' evil plan. &nbsp;Whether or not this guy is involved in that plot is something we will have to wait and see.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><div>Nothing exciting here, just your standard minifig build</div><h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks great, and actually makes me want to MOC a Mexican restaurant. &nbsp;Might have to do that sometime soon.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>Overall, a great figure that is worth trying to feel for! &nbsp;Pick it up before they're gone!</div>",TRUE,4,5,2,4,3

However, the minifig-series connected to the movie have some really fun characters/pieces.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>This one in particular is cool. I can see people using this guy for their own building projects (apart from the movie) - it's not hard to figure out why.</div><div><br></div><h4>The figure</h4><div><b>Head:</b></div><div>This taco-man has a cool ""you can trust me"" kind of face. Great moustache too above his sales smile.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Torso:</b></div><div>The colours here (red arms, green torso) gives him a bright look. Almost reminds me of early castle figures.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Legs:</b></div><div>Dark red, almost maroon in colour, and they also have some great taco-scheme printing in red and green.

Two fabric pieces to make up his poncho with loads of printing in bright taco-theme colours. There are loads of yellow, red and green, which would be expected.

Great!</div><div><br></div><div>This might be one sought after minifigure. Great if you want to create your own taco fast food place (perhaps you need multiples, for the pieces).

<p>Re-using parts from the very hard to find Series 2 Mariachi character, TTG includes the sombrero, a poncho which hides his plain un-printed lime green torso and a large dish printed with Jalapeno peppers and typical Mexican dish designs. Sitting inside the dish are two slices of cheese. His facial print is perfect for this character, and is legs feature limited fiesta style printing running down the sides.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great re-use of parts from Series 2 and it&#39;s definitely one you&#39;ll want to buy over and over again. My one real complaint is that while he does hae an interesting looking poncho is torso is plain and unadorned. I wish he had some kind of print.</p>

"tkettle9719","2014-06-25T22:22:00.45Z","Collectable Minifigures 71004: Taco Tuesday Guy REVIEW","<p>Ah, Taco Tuesday. One of the most hilarious parts of &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot;. Seeing as this idea was a massive component of Lord/President Business&#39; plan to unleash the Kragle&nbsp;on the entirety of the Lego universe, these Taco Tuesday Guys seem very important; in fact, having an army of these things would be great for Taco Tuesday TacOver&nbsp;(see what I did there?). In all seriousness, though, the Taco Tuesday Guy is a great addition to &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot; character canon; nicely designed, comical, and relevant to the film.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The printed parts here are beautiful; the legs, first off, are surprisingly detailed with zig-zag stripes on both sides. The chip bowl, also, is a beautiful piece for a restaurant creation; it is stereotypical, mind it, but it looks very well-painted and is extremely colorful.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The minifigure&nbsp;is also well-suited to pair up with the Mariachi&nbsp;Man from Series 2; they look very similar, but have differing color schemes and accessories; an army off these would be great for a city cantina scene. By itself, however, it is very presentable.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The chips contained are a nice detail; yet, they have a very serious problem of being constantly thrown off of the bowl that they are supposed to be held in; no fix is really possible, however, so the bowl must be carefully used.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I also find it ironic that the printing on this set is used on the legs; although I think it is essential due to it already being present, I find it strange that printing was not done on the upper body. It may be covered, but so is the printing done on many minifigures which are later covered completely in massive armor. Just saying...</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Taco Tuesday Guy is a very nice addition to &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot; mythos. He is very presentable and desirable, and would work out well in a Cantina MOC. If anybody could actually build a Taco to display and hold with this set, all the better. Overall, these LEGO Movie Collectable Minifigures&nbsp;are almost all unessential to the theme&#39;s overall experience; yet, having a few to populate your display, especially this one, doesn&#39;t hurt at all.&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-02T15:13:27.847Z","Taco TUESDAY!","<p>The LEGO Movie Series has some peculiar choices, and I personally would have cut a lot of the characters included. However, the twelfth figure in the set, Taco Tuesday Guy, is one of my favourite choices, and is an excellent figure. He has 9 pieces, released in 2014, and was part of the last series to cost $2.99.</p>

<p>Though it was not new for the figure, the sombrero piece not only looks fantastic caste in red, but the 360 degree printing around the rim is very impressive. I&#39;ve always loved that piece, so I like getting it here!</p>

<p>The head print is super expressive, and it fits the character expertly. I adore his&nbsp;winking eye, as well as his massive moustache and smile. He has no back face print, but that&#39;s okay, since it&#39;d be severely exposed from that hat.</p>

<p>Much like the Series 2 Mariachi, he includes two poncho pieces that attach at the neck. They&#39;re made from a hard cloth material, and the pattern is insanely intricate and intricately insane. It has so much detailing, and it may be the most detailed cloth piece thus far in the CMF theme.</p>

<p>His torso lacks printing, but getting a plain green torso is super useful for custom figures. The plain red arms contrast nicely, and the colour scheme of this whole figure really pops to me.</p>

<p>His legs are caste in dark red that works so well with the other colours. I appreciate the small but noticeable pop of green and red on the thighs. He doesn&#39;t have side printing, unfortunately.</p>

<p>For his accessories, we have a taco bowl and two tacos. Tacos are represented with two 1x1 tiles, which is a little lacklustre, but it&#39;s good enough for me; I appreciate how two are included. However the dish, while not a new mould, is such a useful part, and the colour scheme of red, green, and dark yellow blend together masterfully. The printing inside the rim is great!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this minifigure, and overall, this has to be one of my favourites in the series. Not only is it a great choice in relevance to the movie, but the printing combined with the colour scheme makes for one of the most detailed figures in the CMF line yet.&nbsp;This is an easy 5 out of 5 for me, and it might just be my favourite in the set!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
