"alexfig8","2013-12-30T13:44:03.9Z","Interesting Minifig","<p>I bought this guy yesterday, on the day they came out, along with Taco Tuesday guy and the Getaway Glider. &nbsp;It can be VERY easily felt for, as all you have to do is feel for 2 pairs of legs. &nbsp;Here are my thoughts on it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Same foil pack we get with the Collectable Minifigures, except this one is dark blue. &nbsp;It features the Lego Movie logo in the corner and shows a sampling of the 16 minifigures in the series on the front. &nbsp;It includes the standard mini-poster, which instead of showing how to build the minifigures, it advertises an app or something.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Other than the&nbsp;Hawaiian&nbsp;shirt torso, nothing too special here. &nbsp;The bare legs can be useful for a swim suit, other than that nothing amazing. &nbsp;The face is kinda fun though.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>As well as some of the sets, my brother bought the Essential Guide to the Lego Movie. &nbsp;From what I can understand by reading it, this guy appears on TV every night, looking for his pants, which he never finds. &nbsp;We'll have to wait for the movie to see how this plays out in Lord Business' evil plot.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Nothing new here.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Looks decent, obviously a little hard to use in a city scene, but I'm sure people will come up with some creative uses for him. &nbsp;Switch the bare legs for the white pants, and make him into just a citizen of your town, or put him at your pool MOC as a swimmer. &nbsp;Overall, a decent minifig. &nbsp;</p>

Guy: </strong>Sharon&#39;s Co-Star from the brainwashing television series of the same name, I mean it has to be brainwashing citizens of Bricksberg because come on! But I digress, this minifigure is a brief cameo given physical form, as he didn&#39;t seem to do too much during the movie.</p>

<p>The most impressive aspect of this figure is his Hawaiian print shirt. Sadly it&#39;s only a single-sided torso print. He has a decent facial expression with a wide open smile and the 1950&#39;s Greaser Hairpiece first introduced with the Mechanic is back in black. His accessory is just a spare set of white LEGO legs, his pants if you will. Does this mean he&#39;s only wearing underwear?</p>

<p>Overall not much to say, but still nice to see in this series. If nothing else he comes with a useful Hawaiian print shirt for MOC fig fans.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-06T00:08:24.867Z","Where is my BACK PRINTING?","<p>One of the most iconic and memorable aspects of The LEGO Movie has got to be the Where are my Pants? Guy. He delivered such memorable lines, such as, &quot;Where are my paaaaaaaaants?,&quot; and, &quot;Where are my paaaaaaants?&quot; But my personal favourite line from this character was when he said, &quot;Where are my paaaaaaaants?,&quot; which is the line this character is named after. He was released in 2014 to coincide with no other than The LEGO Movie, where he included 5 pieces, and retailed for $2.99.</p>

<p>On top is a hair-piece that&#39;s been around since 2012. It&#39;s great seeing it reused here, since it isn&#39;t the most common part out there. I&#39;ve always loved the moulding surrounding it, and of course, it matches the on-screen appearance.</p>

<p>As for the head, it sports a very chipper smile that&#39;s super fitting for the character, and it&#39;s highly useful outside this series.</p>

<p>The torso, much like the face, is super useful outside this series, and the printing on that part is brilliant. I love the colourful flowers, like red, green, and orange, but his lack of back printing is unbelievably disappointing. Side arm printing would have been nice, but it&#39;s definitely more excusable than his blank back.</p>

<p>He does technically include two, but the set of legs attached to the figure depicting undergarments is the correct one to use. The use of a white waist piece combined with yellow legs definitely does a fantastic job depicting underwear, and it&#39;s such a simple yet effective technique.</p>

<p>Accessory-wise, he includes the best possible accessory ever, a pair of pants. It&#39;s just a white set of legs with no printing, but it is super effective, super fitting, and an absolute;y fantastic accessory that is an excellent inclusion with the character.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this figure, and overall, it is far from being the most detailed of the series, and it severely lacks back printing. With that being said, I feel like this series was practically made for this figure, as it&#39;s just an absolutely perfect inclusion, and it&#39;s one of the best figure choices in this entire set. Overall, I&#39;m giving it a 4 out of 5, because while it isn&#39;t the most detailed, it&#39;s accurate, and iconic.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
