"Odeinoichus","2015-10-25T17:37:46.207Z","Born on a Mountaintop?","<p><strong>Set #71004 Wiley Fusebot: </strong>An enforcer of Lord Business in the Old West this particular character introduced two brand new pieces, the coonskin cap and the scraggley looking beard.</p>

<p>Wiley has a lot of personality, his torso is a double-sided print with some overalls covering a brown undershirt, he also has a necklace of feathers, teeth and what appears to be the tip of a wolf&#39;s tail. All the stuff you&#39;d expect to see on an old prospector living alone in the mountains. His legs have minimal printing with a patch on one knee and a gunpowder horn for an old pistol, much more commonly used by the Pirates compared to Western themed weapons. The cheeks even add some character printed with extra screws or rivets for freckles.</p>

<p>For accessories you have your standard Western pistol and a stick of dynamite. His coonskin cap is a great new head piece which we really need to see more of, in the more traditional dark grey and black for the ring-tailed creature. Overall this is one of the stronger offerings from this series and a must have for fans of the old west. Strongly recommend tracking this one down if you missed it originally.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-07T00:37:23.807Z","strange choice, but DETAILED!","<p>Some of the characters found in The LEGO Movie Series are definitely worthy of omission, and if I don&#39;t remember a character immediately after watching the film, that means it&#39;s a bad choice. Thus is the case with Wiley Fusebot. I legitimately just watched The LEGO Movie, and I still don&#39;t remember who this character is. He includes 7 pieces, and was part of the last series to retail for $2.99.</p>

<p>The first piece we&#39;ll look at is also the best, that being the racoon-fur hat. It was introduced with this minifigure, and it looks absolutely superb! Not only is there intricate fur moulding surrounding the outer rim, but there&#39;s fur on top, and even down the tail extension! Speaking of which, the furry tail has stripes of dark brown printing. I would absolutely love to see this piece reused for a CMF in the future!</p>

<p>I think the head print might be the weakest part of the figure, but&nbsp;it&#39;s fantastic. Hear me out, this is a pretty bad choice for the series considering he is so obscure, but I can&#39;t deny how awesome the figure is! Anyway, his head printing is expressive as heck, with his intimidating red eyes, and missing robotic teeth. I love the robotic stubble around the beard!</p>

<p>Speaking of the devil, the beard piece was, believe it or not, was a brand-spanking new part for this CMF. It&#39;s been used a truckload of times since then, so its introduction here is somewhat surprising. It&#39;s caste in red-brown, which is pretty useful. Personally, I don&#39;t love that piece, as it looks a little too square to me, but I won&#39;t deny that it&#39;s a great mould.</p>

<p>Since the torso has no robotic flesh, it&#39;s a very useful print, and it&#39;s one that I&#39;m pretty dang fond of. I appreciate the brown overalls, as well as the grey racoon tail, which wraps around the neck. Believe it or not, this figure has some extensive back printing, which was something we didn&#39;t see much of in this series. It&#39;s crazy to see it&nbsp;integrated with a figure who already has two new moulds! I&#39;m all for it!</p>

<p>Like the torso, his legs are expertly done, with a fantastic horn hanging from his waist. He also has a strap which extends horizontally. I am truly impressed with the insane level of detail this figure sports!</p>

<p>The details don&#39;t cease there, as he also comes with not one, but two accessories, one of which is that pistol. It wasn&#39;t new for the figure or anything, but its inclusion is highly appreciated, and I&#39;m surprised to see it here! His second accessory is a stick of dynamite, which he can briefly be seen using in the film. That piece was far from new, but again, its inclusion is absolutely brilliant, and faithful to the movie.</p>

<p>Overall, the concept behind this obscure character is a little peculiar, but at the end of the day, I can&#39;t exactly think of a better choice that wasn&#39;t already in the series. This figure is extremely impressive and intriguing. Not only does he have two brand new moulds that are both beautifully sculpted and useful, but he has some surprisingly detailed back printing, and a shocking inclusion of two accessories. So, while I still think he&#39;s an obscure character, I&#39;ve got to&nbsp;give this figure justice with a 5 out of 5 rating.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
