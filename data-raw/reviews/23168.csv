"hewman","2014-01-22T19:12:15.947Z","Some not so obvious observations about the not so rare panda","This review will be brief and just give a few points that may not be immediately obvious from the pictures here. The Panda Guy although appearing to be a simple mascot is actually an undercover Master Builder. OK, not quite as cool as Batman's Bruce Wayne alter ego, but probably less obvious.<div><br></div><div>If you're randomly selecting a figure from a box in a shop, there's a good chance you will get this fig. Firstly, because there are 6 in a box of 60 and secondly the panda suit guy does not feature strongly in any of The Lego Movie promotional material so far. So those that have used the feel method to get which figs they want aren't as likely to be interested in this fig as some of the others.<div><br></div><div>The brick quality is typical of the collectible series, the black on the legs and torso of the minifig are slightly dull and not quite up to regular minifig standard. The toy panda accessory however has no immediate quality issues.</div><div><br></div><div>The leg printing is another issue. It is not at all like the quality in the picture provided by Lego. It has a washed out appearance like the printing wasn't applied thickly enough. With the black of the legs underneath this results in a greyish appearance.</div><div><br></div><div>Besides the cute panda accessory, the best part of this fig was a little sweat drop printed on the head of the fig. Anyone that has worn a costume like this will know how quick you get hot and sweaty in one.</div><div><br></div><div>I paid a reasonable $3.35 AU for this, and at that price I'm more than happy to add to what I'm sure will be a large collection of the Master Builders from The Lego Movie.</div></div>",TRUE,3,3,2,3,3
"Odeinoichus","2015-10-17T17:31:53.56Z","I have no quote","<p><strong>Set #71004 Panda Guy: </strong>Yet another Master Builder from Cloud Cuckoo Land, the Panda Guy also has the honor of being another animal suit wearing minifigure with a double-sided torso print.</p>

<p>Speaking of which this minfigure has a very simple torso print, it isn&#39;t greatly detailed, but it does an excellent job of indicating the panda and the fact that this is a costume when seen from behind with the zipper in back. The legs have limited printing to include the traditional look of the panda, his accessory is a stuffed panda, and his head piece hides a goofy secret. The facial expression reveals that Panda Guy is sticking his tongue out at President Business&#39; Robot Drones. (He&#39;s also sweating up a storm. But not as upset about it as Gorilla Suit Guy was.)</p>

<p>Overall, while I don&#39;t believe he even had a line in the film, he is quite fun to see in this collection and a must own figure if you&#39;re a fan of animal suit wearing characters. I really hope we continue to see these in the CMF series, it&#39;d be nice to see a Giraffe Suit Guy or Elephant Suit Guy, maybe a Zebra Suit Guy/Girl using the parts from Unicorn Girl. Anyway recommended.</p>

"Tjfa2001","2014-02-14T13:03:24.333Z","I really like this minifig!","<p><strong>I think that this model is very nice; coinciding nicely with the Lego Movie and the other suited Lego minifigs. The attention to detail with the head is impressive and the little panda makes the&nbsp;minifigure quite cute. Despite this, the white paint on the legs does look sort of grey when put&nbsp;upon&nbsp;black legs and the price HAS gone up. Overall all though I am very pleased with this model and don&#39;t think that this matters too much.</strong></p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2018-11-29T21:42:09.38Z","71004 Panda Guy","<p>I am a huge panda fan, so I recently bought this figure on EBay. Here are my views on it. The front of the torso has a white circle which continues on to the legs to represent it&#39;s tummy. Sadly, the section on the legs is a little darker than that on the torso, although this is not too noticable. There is a similar patch on the back of the torso, but with a zipper running through it. His helmet is unique to this character, and has black printing on the ears, around the eyes, and on the nose. My nose was a little faded even though it was a new figure. This may not be a wide-spread problem though. One of my favorite details which is not apparent from the pictures though is that he is sweating and panting under the helmet! He also comes with a teddy near accesory reprinted as a panda which looks great! It&#39;s printing matches those on the panda guy, so they look great together. Nowadays you&#39;ll have to pay a little more than $4 for him, although I still believe it is worth it as he looks great on display and would also nicely compliment some of the Lego movie sets. I hope you find this review helpful!</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-07T01:49:18.133Z","ADORABLE!","<p>Some of the minifigures found in The LEGO Movie Series are a little obscure and hard to remember, primary figures based off the master builders found in Cloud Cuckoo land. The Panda Guy is one of those characters who&#39;s&nbsp;not all too memorable, but still makes for a good figure. He includes 5 pieces, was released in 2014, and retailed for only $2.99.</p>

<p>The mask piece was brand new&nbsp;for the figure, which I definitely appreciate.I love the rounded nature of that part, and how the ears cutely protrude from the surface. The black printing surrounding them, the eyes, and the round nose is commendable.</p>

<p>His head print underneath is very useful! It&#39;s a sweating but smiley face, which is an expression we&#39;ve never before got in the CMF line, if I&#39;m not mistaking. He doesn&#39;t have an alternate face, but I don&#39;t expect him to.</p>

<p>The torso looks good, but I do think it suffers from not being caste in black. Granted, the white stomach printed on a black piece would have looked equally bad, but something just looks off about the strange cut off of black fur around the edges. The black arms do sort of make-up for it, though. Now this character sports some impressive back printing as well, which features a silver zipper extending vertically, backdropped with black fur.</p>

<p>Though Brickset&#39;s image does little justice to the print, the white leg printing matches and blends seamlessly with the torso, in a very clean demeanour.</p>

<p>His accessory is brilliant, it being a small panda-bear stuffie. It&#39;s absolutely adorable, but unfortunately, I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a new mould or not. I can confirm it was new printing, but it might have even been a new mould; I&#39;m not sure. Either way, as mentioned, the printing surrounding that piece is extraordinary, and it&#39;s honestly ahead of its time.</p>

<p>Overall, while this might not be the most relevant character to the movie, he looks absolutely adorable. On top of that, he has very impressive printing, as well as one, possibly two, new pieces. 5 out of 5 figure for me!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
