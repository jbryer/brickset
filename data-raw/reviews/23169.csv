"Odeinoichus","2015-10-17T17:38:39.277Z","Queen of the Mermaids!","<p><strong>Set #71004 Marsha, Queen of the Mermaids:</strong> This was a one-note character made for a fun little joke in the film, but as it re-uses some rare parts it was definitely great to see her included as part of this series of CMF characters.</p>

<p>Marsha is a Master Builder and includes the same hair and tail piece from the Mermaid. Here the printing is different, even her torso print has a different overall design. Accessories include a jewel and a clam, not sure how they help her during master building, but definitely nice to see. Her hair is just gorgeous and I&#39;m a bit envious that we haven&#39;t seen this particular shade used again. A starfish and seaweed are printed in the hair as a hairclip or something of that nature.</p>

<p>Overall while she is a cheap re-use of parts, she is a decent addition to the Mer-People of LEGO CMF and it&#39;s definitely a good idea to pick her up for the unique coloring choices of her tail and hair. I hope we see more of her in the sequel with some interesting and perhaps witty dialogue to give her.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-07T22:45:36.853Z","BAD CHOICE!","<p>The final minifigure in The LEGO Movie Series follows an unfortunate pattern some others in the set suffer from: unrecognition. See, this character was ever-so-briefly on screen, alongside many other master builders from Cloud Cuckoo Land. Thus, she was lost in the crowd. I don&#39;t know why she is included here, as she&#39;s yet another underwhelming choice, but oh well. She was released in 2014, where she included 6 pieces, and was part of the last ever series to cost only $2.99.</p>

<p>Starting the figure is a very uncommon hairpiece, that being the wavy piece which has been used for quite some time. Here, it&#39;s caste in a new sky-blue colour that does look gorgeous. The printed purple detail is very pretty indeed, and very much appreciated.</p>

<p>Her face print is great, albeit not very useful. No alternate expression is incorporated.</p>

<p>The torso has the same status as the face: great, but not very useful. I can excuse that with this figure, however, since the prints were made specifically for this character. She lacks back printing, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Personally, my favourite aspect of this figure has got to be the tail. Not only is it an otherwise uncommon piece, but here, we get it caste in an exclusive colour, that being light purple. I&#39;ve always loved that part, and it does not fail me here, with its extensive moulding and equally impressive scale printing.</p>

<p>Accessory-wise, she included two, both of which are good. I am surprised two are included at all! The first accessory is a light-purple jewel, which is not the most common in that colour. The second is a white clam, which again, is not the most common piece ever, so it&#39;s great to see used here.</p>

<p>Overall, this is one of my least favourites in the series. Don&#39;t get me wrong, she has good parts and prints, but she&#39;s extremely unmemorable from the film, and she feels extremely out of place with the rest of the series. I&#39;m still gonna give her a 3 out of 5, but that&#39;s only because of her decent pieces.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
