"mrmitch","2008-02-11T03:51:35.093Z","Unique mini-figures in this set !","The heads have two faces on them, you get certian characters that are not available in any other set. Loads of extra stuff in this set, plus it does come with 3 mini figures or is it 6 - buy it to find out.  Good addition to any Harry Potter collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"eskallon","2009-05-08T01:33:24.297Z","One of the best small sets","I absolutly love this set. It comes with loads of pieces exclusive to this set and the figures really make this set shine. It is nice that they include the snakes and the owl and that their are added potions instead of just figures. The door opens as a trapdoor kind a thing and it just adds to the coolness of the et.

Overall a great set and I would recommend itto anyone and already have tod people about it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mngoult","2010-01-06T07:45:15.31Z","Reversable Heads, but it doesn't look like a common room.","Sticking with the theme of having a name that has little to do with what the set looks like. It looks more like a potions classroom to me and compliments 4712 nicely by also having a stupid arch on top of it.

The movable wall section is nice and makes a change from the brown doors often seen in sets starting with 47..... The reversable heads are a nice touch.

The set feels a little half finished and even the array of extra utensils and swords can't hide the fact that this set is not up to scratch. Get it for the minifigs (how often is that said in HP sets) and the clear goblet. Only two stars and its lucky to get them.

Pros
Good minifig count for small set.
Slyrtherin shied is nice.

Cons
No effort made with the room at all.
Arch is poorly made and has to come of anyway if you put 4712 on top of it.
Why all the potions equipment? And what on earth is that sword for, no effort spared for the sword holder either. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-13T05:01:21.847Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Slytherin Review","This scene is from the second movie from Harry Potter where Harry and Ron Weasley should drink their potion to change into Crabbe and Goyle to interrogate Draco Malfoy. We get three minifigs. Two of them are exclusive to this set. The two exclusive minifigs we get here are Crabbe and Goyle. Both have a double-printed face which show you the faces of Harry and Ron on the back. It's the only set where you can find these minifigs. The third minifig we get in this set is Draco Malfoy. Malfoy is not a special minifig.<br><br>This set is an easy built and also fun to play with. We get a table where you can see some bottles and a pot where Harry and Ron can make their potion. The slytherin room just has a printed wall which opens and a table with a clear glass and another bottle. On the other side is a small sword. On the top is a rare slytherin shield and you can also see a snake on each side. We also get a black owl in this set. You won't have to worry about stickers and this set is also very sturdy. If you're looking for rare minifigs I would recommend you to pick this set up.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-11T13:40:42.013Z","Crabbe & Goyle? Ron & Harry","<p>Set #4735 Slytherin: The common room of the Slytherin House is a dungeon. This set is meant to represent it, it is on the smallish side, but it is an interesting set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model is built up with a thin base plate as opposed to the thicker ones from the earlier sets. It uses large pillar pieces for the walls (really just alcove archways.) and a unique printed brick for the back wall of the dungeon that is built using hinged plates to open and close the door.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upper section of the model uses bridges and some green pieces to enhance that Slytherin look, it also includes two black snakes meant to be stone representations of the dreaded animals and a very unique piece, a Slytherin themed long shield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is much too small to be a common room though, but if it is used as just the entrance to a much larger MOCed common room it could look much better. This set includes a small table for some potions to be kept, but it can't go on the base plate without taking up all the room meant for the figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still this set is a good deal. It's a cheap little set within the 10-15$ range, it has some unique Mini-Figures with double-sided heads. One side for Crabbe and Goyle the other for Polyjuiced Harry and Ron. (Personally I'd rather just pretend they're the genuine Crabbe and Goyle as opposed to another Harry and Ron.) This set also included a Castle sword to go with the Slytherin shield. If you wanted to really stretch your imagination you could have Draco charging off to lend a hand in your Castle sets fighting either alongside the heroic knights or the villainous ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set as part of your Hogwarts Castle MOC. It has some great unique pieces and some interesting accessories. Plus as of this date I think it is still the only set to feature Crabbe and Goyle. (Or Polyjuiced Harry and Ron if you'd prefer.)</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"woodall_aidan","2011-12-18T15:45:22.967Z","Ugh! Essence of Crabbe!","This set is pretty much a two-in-one set. I say that because there is a table with the pot of Polyjuice Potion and more potion ingredients and then there is the Slytherin common room itself. This awesome set also includes Harry, who is disguised as Gregory Goyle, Ron, who is disguised as Vincent Crabbe, and Malfoy. In the common room, you'll find a small table with a glass, as well as a black cylinder with a green crystal protruding out of the top. The common room also has a wall brick with the Slytherin emblem, and that piece is also unique to the set. Overall, this set gets a 4/5.<br>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
