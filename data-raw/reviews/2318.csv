when I bought this one and the scorpion orb launcher (4774)
I saw that the newer (4774) flex was shaved..kinda cool
now you can say..&quot;I do have 2 flexes and they are yust the same ;)&quot;

so my answer is: a good 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-04T23:32:21Z","Nice small set","Nothing too special about this set, but it's not too bad.  The transforming quality is pretty neat; you can swing the &quot;legs&quot; all over the place, making quite a few different vehicles.  Pretty good set overall.  Hope I find some on clearance sometime.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-12T20:05:07Z","Really cool set","Well, I just got this today. It's really cool, and I really like the sliding pieces at the back. An Flex (The Fig) Has changed alot, he looks better now. (Before he looked a little too happy). Flex's hands are really hard to get off the controls. Anyway, the alpah mode is very cool. Go ahead, 9!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Outcast","2008-07-10T14:18:34.09Z","What happened to Flex?","Personally I don't like the new Flex. The old one with the big smile was better. Anyways, this is a great small set. It comes with an ice orb and a trans-red magnifying glass (common in the Mission Deep Freeze series, but not in many other themes) to deactivate the orb. It also transforms into a robot walker.

Pros:

-Flex (only repeated in the Scorpion Orb Launcher)
-Alpha Mode (transformation) is cool
-Ice Orb
-Minifig skis
-No stickers

Cons:

-Legs become flimsy after a while
-Minifig can't sit down
-Strange new Flex

This is a great set with not many cons. Buy it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2008-01-02T18:25:50.95Z","Its a speeder its a mech.","For a seven dollar set this was a good addition to the Alpha Team ice theme. There was one minifig. He has printed legs and torso along with sunglasses and a Bluetooth and a useful hat. Unlike other Alpha Team sets he had accessories, an ice axe and a red magnifying glass that could be used to observe the little ice orb to see a bug design printed on it. The speeder also has some white skis that are used as landing gear, but he could use them if needed.
The box to this set like other Alpha Team boxes has a little diagram in the corner of the box that when light is shown on it at different angles it shows the chill speeder transforming into the mech.
The speeder looks nice when completed at the back of it are some torch pieces that are supposed to be engines, when transformed into mech mode they double as guns. The transition from speeder to mech is simple the sloped pieces in front of the speeder change into its feet and some rotating bars act as legs. Then you stand the minifig up on top of a plate and move the engine pieces into gun position. Because of its &quot;legs&quot; the mech can manage a bit of a walk. Finally the &quot;Ice Orb&quot; is made up of a minifig head on top of a stud put into a crystal ball with a little inverse plate on the bottom.
Overall this is a well put together set. The speeder looks and functions well the minifig looks good and comes with lots of accessories. I can't find anything to dock points for. 5/5

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-24T13:15:58.86Z","Wish I got more of these","This was one of the only three Alpha Team sets I ever got. It was fun having Flex race across the Arctic tundra (my bed) to disarm the ice orb before it detonated and then have him painstakingly disarm it. Good times. This set comes with Flex, an ice orb (way cooler than those skulls in jars from Mission Deep Sea), a pickaxe, and a magnifying glass to help him disarm the orb. The Chill Speeder can transform into an ice walker in nothing flat, which is useful if the orb is on a cliff ledge, or Flex could get up there with the pickaxe. Maybe he's rushing to escape from the Scorpion Orb Launcher if his hang glider beaks? Infinite possibilities.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-26T09:46:53.153Z","I have two... and I'm loving them!!","My mom got my brother and I one of these each, but like many of Joe's old sets, it got broken up.  I kept mine, though (I LOVED Alpha Team) and built his back from a bazillion pieces in the Lego box for myself.  I love this set, and I think that the ice orb is better, too.  The Alpha Mode is neat, and just the sled itself with the pickaxe and magnifying glass is awesome.

Pros:

-Alpha Mode

-Playability!!  Joe and I got hours out this thing!

-Ice orb looks sweet

-Details on the speeder

Cons:

-None!!

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2009-03-16T10:26:23.81Z","Initiate Alpha Mode!","I absolutely loved this set. I bought this set multiple times again because it was cheap, extremely fun to play with, and had an outstanding value. Though the new design of Flex from previous Alpha Team missions shocked me at first, the new Flex grew on me easily. I love how the Chill Speeder changes into Alpha Mode so quickly and without breaking, and the red magnifying glass to decode the ice orb and pickaxe to get through the ice. I had countless fun with this set, and this set is one of the reasons Alpha Team is better than agents.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This is the smallest Alpha Team set in the 2004 line, so I'll be brief as I can.<br><p>The Chill Speeder is a repulsorlift vehicle used by Flex, the team's bungee expert and comic relief.

<p>This is my Chill speeder, it is a small but very cool set. It's more detailed than you would think. On the botttom of the speeder are two skis, you can put them on a figure too</p>

<p>Of course is the alpha-mode very creative as well. It's a robot! (if you don't have a teevee, you can use it. when i was younger I played with it as a teevee)</p>

<p>2 tools are there. you can watch the ice orb with it. (that's very cool either)</p>
