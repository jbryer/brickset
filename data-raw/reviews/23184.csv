"Faire","2014-06-28T13:07:51.023Z","Neat!","<p>This is the first non-Duplo set we have chosen for our son (2,5 yrs). He loves machines, cars and especially long trucks, so we it was quite a clear choice for us - and a good one for sure! The building techniques have changed quite a lot since my childhood and it was nice to see some of the ideas (rear mirrors of the truck, shape of the helicopter, suspension on the buggy) - really smart and fun. he build was easy and didn&#39;t take long (thought we have build the police part of the set on the first day and criminals on next one), the plan was really easy to follow, the bricks themselves were well separated and it was really easy to find the parts I needed.</p>

<p>I like all of the parts. The truck looks great and works great with the trailer. I like the design of the cabin and motor part. The trailer is quite standard, but the compartments and connection with the heli are nice touches. The helicopter is probably the nicest looking small LEGO heli I have ever seen and didn&#39;t use too many monoblocks. The dirt bike is really simple but also fun to zoom around - and the same goes for the buggy. And the hiding place just increases the fun of the whole set.<br />
<br />
My son really loves it - when he woke up the next day and saw the truck in his playroom he just lit up. It is a great starter or his City set - 4 vehicles in on box, with smart interactions. We are loving it!</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>equipment doesn&#39;t fit the compartments</li>
	<li>the heli&nbsp;is a bit fragile - especially the external&nbsp;camera and also the glass cockpit block</li>
	<li>the hideout should have second connection point in the upper section - quite unstable as it is</li>
</ul>

<p>I am a fan of Lego tractor trailers and Lego police; this set combining both elements, I decided to get it from Bricklink. And by and large, it did not disappoint. The buggy for the criminals, the helicopter and tractor are all fun (and easy) builds. Personally, I like the look of the set, and this helicopter design seems to be fairly unique within Lego. The set offers also a lot of opportunity for play: a dirt-bike, buggy, helicopter, tractor-trailer, two cops and two criminals: a lot of chasing can be done. Overall, I think this quite a good set, with and if found for around the original RRP definitely good value for money.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build was actually more fun than I expected - due to the given age range I expected the built to be very easy.&nbsp; I am also not a fan of the many small booklets. I was very pleasantly surprised though. Yes, the builds are simple, but the designer has done a great job in creating brilliant little vehicles. The tractor, buggy and especially the trailer follow the pattern of other Lego sets. The helicopter, IMHO is more original, especially in the construction of its tail. I also like the use made of - what seems to be - pantographs from train sets as bumpers.</p>

<p>The bed of the&nbsp;flat-bed trailer is a single 16x6&nbsp;plate, and there are no true stiffners&nbsp;underneath.</p>

<p>As with all police sets, there are quite a few stickers be placed.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are two crooks&nbsp;and two police officers (one pilot, one truck driver). Apparently one of the crooks (the one with the gold shirt under his striped prison clothing) is unique, while the other minifigs&nbsp;can also be found in other sets. All minifigures have torso prints on the front and back. The torso prints are well done. None of the minifigs&nbsp;have an alternate head, speaking of which, it seems that cops are universally equipped with sunglasses, and crooks are unshaven.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As said before, the designer has done a good job. The tractor trailer combination, especially when carrying the helicopter, is quite impressive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police helicopter is well designed, and looks like a finished product. It also has great swooshability&nbsp;and fairly solid. The attached loudspeaker and light/camera can come off fairly easily though. There are six stickers applied; they do add something to the model though.</p>

<p>The tractor/trailer combo is simple but effective. Overall I like the design, bright pieces are nicely hidden. Of course the red mug is included as well. The one thing I do not like about the trailer is are the grey elements on top. Although not as off-putting as brightly coloured bricks, they still look off. Two sets of chains to fix the helicopter to the trailer would have been a nice addition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The buggy / dirt-track racer is again an example of creating something with the use of relatively few pieces. It looks like a nimble race-vehicle made to shake of cops in pursuit - and can only be followed by a helicopter.</p>

<p>The hiding place for a few gold pieces consists mainly of two medium ugly pieces of rock. The piece of dead schrubbery is nice.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This is above all a play set. The buggy and dirt bike are racers, the helicopter is very swooshable, there are crooks to pursue, loot to hide (money and gold crystals). It is easy to envision many scenarios to play out. Everything can easily be handled by smaller children, and most of it also seems to be able to handle rougher play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set as a whole is also one of the nicer sets, and impressive enough to serve as a display model.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>I would argue that this is an excellent play set, especially for its size. Personally, I think it beats all the 2016 police sets. This set also offers considerable value for money at RRP. If you can still find this set for something close to that RRP, I would not hesitate to pick it up.&nbsp;</p>
