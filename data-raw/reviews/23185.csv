Although this set does lack distinctive and memorable parts and a well-rounded design, it is nevertheless a fun build and has great playability to it. &nbsp;Overall, the Destructoid is worth hunting for to complete your Ninjago Rebooted collection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box itself is quite attractive, and it shows an accurate depiction of the completed set. The back of the box shows all the play features of the set - mainly the chopping blade action and the disc shooter. The instructions are fairly straightforward and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Although this set lacks distinctive parts, it does have some fun parts that can definitely be used in MOCs, such as the ball joints and the transparent red pieces. I love the wonderful selection of blades, and the use of purple. However, if you own other Ninjago&nbsp;sets from this wave or previous waves, the parts here are parts you have probably encountered before.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All in all, I actually prefer the minifigures from this batch of Ninjago sets than other earlier ones. I think these minifigures are more expressive and individualized, and are truer depictions of the cartoon characters. I believe this is the only set so far in the 2014 Ninjago line to feature Zane without his Nindroid components exposed - and that was the major reason why my nephew wanted this set. The set also comes with a General Cryptor&nbsp;minifigure and short-legged mindroid&nbsp;minifigure - both of which appear in other sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Like the instructions, the build is fairly straightforward. There are cool techniques employed - especially the firing mechanism for the disc shooter. It took my 11-year old nephew about 40 minutes to finish the set (sorting and meticulous&nbsp;stickering&nbsp;time included). Although there are stickers, it's an inoffensively manageable amount, with the most difficult stickers being a pair depicting a control panel that should be affixed on the face of two adjacent&nbsp;1x2&nbsp;wedge bricks.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It's an intriguingly peculiar model, and I think it clearly communicates the robot/Nindroid theme that Ninjago will be exploring this year. It's a menacing and terrifying robot, one that, as its name suggests, is out to destroy anything and everything that gets in its way. Just imagine the Destructoid and the MechDragon together. All I can say is run for cover.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As for my nephew, he enjoyed this set overall. It was a fun build, and there's lots of play features to it. I enjoyed the set too, although I do feel that the set could have been more developed. For instance, while the front of the Destructoid is menacing, the back and top of the robot are rather empty, leaving its operator/pilot, General Cryptor, vulnerable to attacks from the rear and above. I wish the designers could have taken cues from the Garmatron, which at least placed a prison cell at the rear of the vehicle. I cannot help but imagine using the top half of the Destructoid&nbsp;as a torso for an even bigger and more menacing MOC robot/mech.&nbsp;</p>
