In some ways this polybag is a little redundant since the exact same Legolas minifigure is available in 2 different other sets. But, when it comes to the LOTR and Hobbit sets, I&#39;m a completionist, so I was pretty excited to get my hands on this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Aside from the minifigure, this polybag is a great purchase since it comes with a good selection of castle-related pieces, included two leaf pieces and some nice dark brown curved slopes.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Even though you can get this minifigure <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-minifig-lor035"">elsewhere</a>, it&#39;s still a fantastic little piece. As with all the LOTR/Hobbit minifigs, Legolas features front and back printing on the torso, depicting the scale armor he wears in the Desolation of Smaug&nbsp;while battling the spiders in Mirkwood forest. The armor pattern is continued on his legs, and his face is printed with both an &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;serious&quot; expression (which is appropriate, since Orlando Bloom seems to have only those two emotions during the movie).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;d have to say that the best thing about this polybag is that it makes a great &quot;army builder&quot; acquisition . . . if you want an army of elves, snag a few of these to get your hands on &quot;pointy-eared&quot; head-pieces and the armored torsos. For Hobbit and LOTR collectors, this set is a must-have, otherwise, I&#39;d save your pennies and pick up one of the other two sets that contain this minifigure.</p>
