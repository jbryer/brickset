"lkb57","2013-12-31T16:36:27.853Z","Awesome Minifigure, great army-building set","<p>When I first saw this minifigure I was really excited, and I snapped up two of the sets ASAP. Lake-town has always been one of my favorite scenes in the Hobbit, and I feel like the newest hobbit movie did a fantastic job of recreating the home of the Lake Men. The Lake-town guard does a good job of being slightly more goofy than the soldiers of Rohan and Gondor that we've seen in Lord of the Rings, but still manages to look threatening at the same time. Even though this is just a polybag set, the build is fun, and the mini-catapult and the weapon's stand do a good job of looking like real equipment a soldier might use.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>For a set with only a few pieces, this polybag does a good job of providing you with a lot of interesting pieces that will really come in handy when building your own LOTR, Hobbit or classic castle MOCs.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Kind of already said this, but the minifigure is awesome. You can kit the guard out as either an archer or a spearman (buy more than one and you can do both at once!). The helmet leaves the back of the head exposed, so there is only a single face on the head (which I kind of appreciate). The torso is printed front and back with a perfect representation of the armor seen in the movie. As a bonus, the legs are printed as well, with a continuation of the guard's coat and chain mail armor.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Whether you're a LOTR/Hobbit completionist, an army builder or a minifig collector, I believe this polybag is a must have. Grab it while you can!</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2014-01-08T21:14:49.977Z","Perfect Companion to Lake-Town Chase","<p><strong>Set #30216 Lake-Town Guard: </strong>This is an excellent polybag from The Hobbit Theme for army builder fans, the best aspect of the set is naturally the Mini-Figure however there are other elements to enjoy here.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>The catapult and weapons rack are decent microbuilds for your display, they work quite well and if you buy multiples of this set you can customize each one however you wish. Some can have the quiver and bow attached, others the spear or even others both. It's up to you which weapon you want your army of Lake-Town Guards to be using at any given moment, mix and match to make fun unique display elements. 
<li>The Lake-Town Guard is an awesome Mini-Figure, the level of detail found in his print the impressive new hat piece that just looks so Middle-Earthy. He's just brilliant. 
<li>The use you can get out of the parts in this set isn't just limited to what you build in it, it's a good parts pack.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>Unless you have spare flesh toned Mini-Figure heads to swap out with this one you're going to have an army of identical clones for your Lake-Town display... And honestly this isn't much of a con. 
<li>The price-per-piece ratio is a bit high, this is common for most polybags these days and I think the value of the contents far outweighs this particular con.</li></ul>
<p>It's nice to see that LEGO continues to give us great army builder Polybags for Middle-Earth, we've had an Uruk-Hai, a Mirkwood Elf Guard (Difficult to find for me I'm afraid) and now this Lake-Town Guard. I'd have to say that as a Polybag it's pretty nifty and the design of the bag itself looks amazing, much better in my opinon than The Lone Ranger Polybag design which is sadly a bit more plain looking.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend trying to get your hands on this one folks, for fans of Polybags it has a nice colourful package design and it also makes for a great investment as it is ony available in certain areas at the moment. Useful for trades I'd wager. And a small contingent of these will go great with the Lake-Town Chase set.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,4
"henrymorris476","2016-01-14T17:44:03.34Z","Great Minifigure But Un-interesting Build","<p>After searching for a while to find a relatively inexpensive polybag,&nbsp;which was however fairly rare due to it only being released in the United States, I was glad to find one at Brick 2015, and&nbsp;at a reasonable price. On building it, I realised&nbsp;it was exactly what it said on the tin...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As mentioned previously set 30216, Lake-Town Guard&nbsp;is a polybag, so comes in the standard bag with folded up, double sided&nbsp;instructions, showing the very simple build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>30216 comes with a small selection of useful parts, but, as with all polybags, is not worth splashing the cash out for, except for the minifigure. It does include a few weapons, though, and a is cheap way to get a catapult piece and interesting colours for certain pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>30216 comes with a single minifigure, the superb Lake-Town Guard. This is the most inexpensive way of getting this figure, as it only comes in one other set, 79013 Lake-Town Chase, and this sets&nbsp;price has increased dramatically&nbsp;since it has been&nbsp;retired. All parts of this minifigure&nbsp;are great, especially the highly detailed printing on the torso, and the wonderful new helmet piece.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is incredibly simple, with no interesting techniques,&nbsp;but with such a limited number of pieces the designer has to be applauded for creating something that has reasonable playability and looks ok.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model, consisting of a small catapult and weapons rack are pretty basic, and are&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;not made for display. The models themselves seem to have been included to justify the price of this polybag, and add some playability to an otherwise lonely minifigure.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is really all about one thing. The minifigure. However the included weapons&nbsp;rack and catapult, do offer some playability, and compared to other polybags&nbsp;both stand up well, in terms of both design and use of parts.</p>

"Battle_Droid__73","2014-11-22T00:30:34.497Z","The Lonely Man of Esgaroth","<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>To start off, this is my first review on Brickset, and I hope to do more. This set, only found for a short time at TRU here in the US, is quite amazing. Even though it&#39;s far over 10c/piece, the minifigure more than makes up for it.</p>

<h3>Box and Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a smaller-sized polybag with the <em>Desolation of Smaug </em>branding. As with all&nbsp;Lego The Hobbit&nbsp;packaging,&nbsp;the&nbsp;bag depicts a warlike action scene.&nbsp;It has small, 2-sided instructions with only a few steps. Thankfully, there are no stickers in this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 31 pieces in this small bag. Considering the size, there is a good selection of parts, but nothing too rare.&nbsp;The&nbsp;front plate&nbsp;of the catapult, the&nbsp;green&nbsp;2x4 plate with a slanted edge&nbsp;(part 6018414) is worthy of note, though.&nbsp;The weapon rack is nothing too special, but has a 1x4 &#39;log&#39; brick. The main draw for this set is really the minifigure.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>There is a single minifigure&nbsp;in this polybag: the Lake-Town Guard. Many of these guys were running around Lake-Town during the Desolation of Smaug movie. This minifigure is completely unique (except for 79013, Lake-Town Chase). It has a silver fish-hat with a band of fur and sideburns. The torso and legs are both outstandingly printed with a purple tunic&nbsp;and red leggings. The guard comes with a spear and then the bow and quiver are built on the weapon rack.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This build is very simple, as expected. There are no special or remarkable techniques that I found.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When the 31 pieces are assembled, a small catapult and weapon rack come forth. The catapult is wimpy and inaccurate to the movie, and does not fire particularly well due to its size. The weapon rack is decent, but also small.&nbsp;It is ideal for placing inside of something else, particularly a fortress of sorts.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For $5, this is a really good set. It&#39;s a fantastic army-builder for those who own 79013 or 79016 (Attack on Lake-Town), but as a standalone set, it&#39;s not that great. This set may also appeal to Castle fans because of the parts.</p>

<p>However, I do think that the single minifigure is quite lonely. It might have been better if Lego included an opposing minifigure, such as an orc, or even better, a dwarf or elf.&nbsp;Besides that, multiples of these are great for anyone who owns the Lake-Town sets!</p>
