This set is just... incredible. $10 dollars for a large set. From looking at Border Ambush, they look as though they SHOULD be evenly priced. Then theres the transforming, so its like two sets in one. The Helicopter is so cool... and it transforms in seconds. Then theres the decoder and orb. They are pretty cool. You hold the blue side up, and you see the spider. You turn it around and it looks like its detonating.

The transforming is easy, and it makes it into a whole new vehicle. I love this set, because of how it Transforms. I also have the Tundra Tracker and the little robot/snowbmobile one.(Forgot the name.)

The main model, the Ice Blade, is very well made.  The only complaint that I have is that it is a bit wobbly sometimes.

The secondary model, the IC-2 helicopter, is also pretty sweet, and the transforming method is clever.  

The pieces are also nice -- the new ######## are good, and I'm glad that the crystal balls are included.

My comments on the minifigure: &quot;Is that CHARGE?!&quot; and also thanks to whoever commented on the Fu Manchu thing, but this looks more like flex than charge... (but it sure isn't crunch, that's for sure)

The set is awesome, and the parts are cool too. The cockpit was a new part (at the time), and so was the windshield, minifigure, orb, and series...

The design for the Ice Blade is sleek, mostly with the giant BLADE in the front and the two laser-type things next to it. The airplane turbines add a cool effect, and the windshield is all but boring. As for the helecopter, the design is also sleek, interesting and fun, plus, as a helecopter, it isn't half bad.

<p>The Alpha Team Ice Blade is one sleek piece of super-spy tech. Not only is it a fast, lean, mean machine- it transforms into a helicopter. How cool is that?!</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Building Experience:</span> Simple enough for any LEGO Builder. Any child should be able to build this set: there's not much technic.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Parts: </span>As with most Alpha Team Deep Freeze sets, there is a large cockpit with a red part of the view screen. This set also includes an ice bomb called an Ice Orb. The minifig, Charge, is one of the best Alpha Team minifigures in my opinion. He just seems so happy to be taking on an evil maniac bent on freezing time.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Playability:</span> This is the reason you should get this set. The playability is very unique; you can change the Ice Blade into a Helicopter faster than you can say &quot;Ogel&quot;. Kids will have a great time playing with this set, transforming the Ice Blade without removing any pieces or destroying the model.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold"">Value: </span>This is one of the better Alpha Team sets. For just $10 you get 108 pieces and amazing transforming action!</p>

I got this set when it came out, as I was a big LEGO random set fan. The transforming function, I thought, was actually kind of cool, but the rotor blades were a little loose and sometimes flopped downwards. This set also includes Agent Chase and another ice orb, of which you can &quot;decode&quot; with the red spot on the cockpit glass.
Pros:
Playability
Another Agent
Transforming function is cool
A lot of rare pieces, such as the turbines and unique cockpit design.
Cons:
Nowhere to store ice orb but cockpit
Floppy propellor blades
No REAR propellor blades

It looks dangerous to bad guys, and it looks ready to zip across the icy tundra landscape and fly over a mountain.  The problem with the IC2 Helicopter Mode is that the rotors are too short.

it can transform to helicopter
fun to play with (at least I can remeber that)
cool new ice orb thing
new minifig

cons

alpha team has changed to much the past years, and It didn't feel like alpha team anymore. for me that's the biggest con, after this set I even didn't bought any alpha team sets. and belive me I was a great fan...luckely for me they have agents now

not much info to find about this new agent...

I really liked it, but back than, I did not take care of my legos, and it got broken and mixed into a lego box. Since then, I have grown very interested with lego, and built this back. Some pieces I could not find and one piece got broken, but I replaced them with different colored ones. It is still cool, but it is now kind of boring by itself. I really like the way it transforms into a helicopter. The guns in  the front droop downward, which I find annoying. The Onua Nuva quakebreakers are in gray, but I still like them. The Kopaka Nuva ice blade is also in gray, but I still like it. The ice orb is made of four pieces, my favorite of which being the minifigure head inside it. Charge is one vof my favorite minifigures because of his face, helmet, and torso, which are all awesome.

pros:
Ice blade.
Quakebreakers.
Translucent orange pieces.
Cool design.
Awesome windshield.
Transforms.
Ice orb
Charge.

cons:
Boring by itself.

<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Shows the Tundra Tracker gliding through the snow on it's blade. Very nice picture.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>First off, the cockpit. It's odd, although it looks decent. The set comes with some transparent orange antennae (short), grey TECHNIC chainsaws, rocket boosters, and numerous other odd parts. Oh yeah-there's stickers on curved parts-very touch to apply correctly. There's also some TECHNIC pieces that are very useful for the Alpha Mode ""function"".<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Charge. He looks NOTHING like the previous charge-instead of a tough adult, he looks more like a kid or teenager who forgot his ADD medication. And what is he wearing? Certainly not the sleek and cool suit from 2001 and 2002-no, it's some oddity with suspenders.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's not challenging, but it's not bad. There's an interesting technique for the transformation. It's still juniorized-the cockpit is so obviously juniorized and a few other parts are as well. During the build you can see a hint of the transformation here and there.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks odd. The cockpit rests awkwardly on the main body. The chainsaws and ski look very nice, as does the large slope piece. However, there are a few slopes that are placed rather awkwardly. And did I mention that the cockpit really doesn't look that good?&nbsp; If I'm not mistaken, and I sure hope I'm not, the vehicle transforms into a helicopter. It pretty much saves everything-the whole front part becomes the tail, two rotors on the side come to the top, and the cockpit becomes the front. Suddenly the turbines are great, and a few other things look good. Now, it's certainly not perfect, but it makes the set a lot more fun.<br></p>

<p>The &nbsp;box is nice, and shows the Ice Blade and Orb against a frozen background. The instructions are clear.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some pretty nice ones in this set. The Sand Blue is rare and nice to have, and the cockpit is interesting. The windscreen is frustrating to open, so I&#39;d recommend placing a brick on its studs to pull it back and open it. The blades cleverly utilize BIONICLE weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Charge is the only one, and he has a nice red outfit. He doesn&#39;t seem well-suited for Arctic fighting, though, so he probably stays inside the Ice Blade at all times.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly quick and interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>At first, it doesn&#39;t look like much. A cool vehicle, but the front blade is a bit wobbly. This is to allow it to transform into a helicopter! The cockpit spins backward on its turntable, the blade can be lifted up and attached to the back of the cockpit, and the rotors unfold from the sides and can be attached to the roof. Now it&#39;s a very nice looking helicopter, and the guns on the new tail can be rotated. It doesn&#39;t have a tail rotor, but it&#39;s still nice. I was impressed by how fast and effective the transformation is. It&#39;s definitely the best play feature I&#39;ve seen in&nbsp;a set its size.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>
