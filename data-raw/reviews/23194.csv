<ul>
	<li>The design is way too simple compared to other the others.</li>
	<li>The arms are hinged, making them extremely restrictive.</li>
	<li>Handlebar does not work well for eyebrows at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are some good things like the teeth, eyes, and fire, but all of those are in other (and much better Mixels).</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-07-31T16:07:25.2Z","Great for parts!","<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of Mixels however, I have a few of them. This Mixel in particular has some excellent parts that can be used to build anything you want! The model itself would be better for a kid to play with. The flame pieces are a nice addition because you can usually only get those in fire fighter sets!</p>

<p>I recommend this set for any kid fan of lego, but the parts are good for anyone!</p>
