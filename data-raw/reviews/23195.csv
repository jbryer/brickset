"toon10001","2014-09-25T20:41:45.563Z","Rock solid set","<p>Today we are reviewing the rock solid (presumably) leader&nbsp;of the Cragsters tribe, Krader. According to the cartoon, he is the leader. Sources also told me Seismo was the leader, but he is not.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Krader comes packaged in a poly packet, typical of all mixels. The box is adorned with a picture of krader, series 1 on the back and a window in the shape of the familiar cubit. The back has some info, not much to say here.</p>

<p>The instructions are halfed, and stored loose. They dont seem to bend easily, despite thoughts they might.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Krader doesnt seem to contain many new parts, aside from the female balljoint connector and the male towbar, which has been around for years (although if im not mistaken, this is a new mold). He has a good selection of gold, and two eyes included with a fair number of mixels.&nbsp;He also includes a nixel, with those parts. Minifigures were eaten earlier by krader.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Krader starts with his legs, then his body and finally his arms. His whole body is on a turntable, and this is essential to creating his rather unique design. One of his hands is larger than the other, and this one is fun to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Krader is by far the most asymetric mixel, with his huge hand along with his tiny one. He can grip with enough posing, and he can articulate his big hand well, since all 3 fingers are on a clip, his hand is attached to a clip and this is all attached to a hinge. He looks cobbled from the back, which looks ok and matches his rock theming. His eyes are very posable, make him look as derp as you want. He looks brilliant, and somewhat adorable. The nixel included means you can have a rock smashing good fight, with the mixel being smashed by the powerful fist of Krader.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>He is a nicely designed model, proof that asymmetry can make a good model. He is posable, nicely designed and is worth the price (which by the way, excluding brick boxes and other systems mixels are the best Price per piece ratio currently on sale). He gets a 4.7/5. Pick him up, and the rest of the cragsters. You wont regret it.</p>

<p>I will review the other cragsters&nbsp;later. Shuff is next. Hope you liked my review, and thanks for reading!</p>
