And the resulting figure is pretty adorable. The one thing I would have liked to see improved is the way the legs are hinged. Though the ball joints have a fairly wide range of movements, the placement does not allow for very &quot;walkable&quot; poses (jumps are another matter entirely, they work great for that).</p>

<p>I&#39;m quite sure we will be buying more Mixels, though, there is quite a lot of fun in that little (cheap) bag.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Least articulate of Series 1.</li>
	<li>I AM following up from the previous point, but hinged arms.</li>
	<li>The golden crystal trophy is too common compared to the Golden Chi which was originally going to be in it.</li>
	<li>The mouth (if you can call it that) is unexpressive.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still better than Seismo.</p>
