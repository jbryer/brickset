<p>The foil pack is like the same thing that the Mixels Series 1-3 has. They show the background of Mixel land, the color of that Mixel to represent the Tribe, and the back showing the Series 1 Tribe and the Electroids Max.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts is some what decent.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No signs of Minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite simple and very quick once I opened the package.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He looks something alike in the shorts but the tongue on the set is somewhat inaccurate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall&nbsp;opinion is he&#39;s a great way to build but there is a con: His tail can easily be popped off but still a great Lego set and I do adore his one eye.</p>
