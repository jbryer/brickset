<p>The only reason to pick up this set is for the movie electro set.</p>

<p>spiderman&nbsp;is nothing special, and his car is very simple.</p>

<p>The box was small, sealed, and although there were some nice shots of the action on the back, I normally end up recycling the boxes.<br />
<br />
And I nearly forgot the instructions! I did have to unfold mine, but that is a such a minor gripe of mine, since I store it, under other instructions, so it will have time to smooth out. There were no multi shaded bricks of similar colours, everything was crisp and clear.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some interesting/rare parts included. Electro&#39;s lightning (5 of them), his stolen diamond/emerald, a couple of flick missiles, truck tires (4...on a trike?), a scissor lift piece held together with a technic pin, and a couple of those long, angled, technic extenders were all included in this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>On the one hand, Spider-man. He&#39;s the same ol&#39;, same ol&#39;, but it is his branch of the superheroes line. At least Batman gets arctic, scuba, movie, blue, grey and black versions from different eras. An old school, or some manor of alternate Spider-man would go a long way for future sets. He&#39;s a good mini figure, but he&#39;s every where.</p>

<p>Electro really shines. Unless you&#39;re a completionist, or hard up for specific parts, this is the reason you spend $12, or I think $16 Canadian, on this set. I have no idea if this is his form from the show, if it&#39;s an &quot;Ultimates&quot; themed Electro, or if TLG are narrowly walking the copyright line with the Sony&#39;s Amazing Spider-man/Jamie Foxx version, but he&#39;s a fine mini-figure.<br />
<br />
A light blue transparent head, same see through arms (with a great effect with his white hands sort of fading out as you look up the arms), and a double printed torso in light blue to match the legs, and although technically it&#39;s a vehicle, his little stand adds a lot to it as a character. I&#39;m glad he&#39;s a minifigure and not a Gollum/Fishface/Star Wars battle droid.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was a very simple build, only 70 pieces after all. Great for smaller children, but as an AFOL, I didn&#39;t get much satisfaction from such a small set. I think I took more time getting the pieces out of the one bag then actually building it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is a sturdy model, there is some playability to it, and just as a test, I have dropped a few times and it holds up. So...durability points?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not a terrible set, but then again, it&#39;s nothing amazing. Spider-man is getting &quot;Batman&#39;d&quot;, getting a whole variety of vehicles that go from impressive, but wholly unnecessary given the scope and nature of his powers, or even other vehicles, to so small, one questions the effectiveness of said vehicle. This falls on the latter side, naturally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a neat trike, just perhaps not suited for Spider-man. Change the pallet, beef it up (ala&nbsp;Venom vs. Spider-man and Nick Fury) put a police officer or security guard, or better yet a henchman, and we have a set. But then we&#39;d find fault with that inclusion, or worse yet the price.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a fine (not great) set for the price point, as it includes an iconic villain (even if we didn&#39;t get his green and yellow classic, over the top, outfit), some hard to come across pieces, and a neat, if not useful, vehicle. If you&#39;re crazy about your piece count per dollar, pick up another similarly&nbsp;priced licensed set (I&#39;m looking at the Penguin set too). If you want a fun little set for a KFOL, or a collecting AFOL&nbsp;or TFOL, I had no problem shelling out $20 Canadian, and still having enough change left for lunch. It&#39;s a &quot;stocking stuffer&quot; set, in the price range of fans who can&#39;t afford the Arkham Asylum&#39;s or Tower of Orthanc on a whim.<br />
<br />
Cheers, and happy building.</p>

"Okay","2014-10-09T18:39:29.187Z","Shockingly Bad","<p>This set is pretty bad. I&#39;m not even going to go into too much detail, I mean, just look at it. It&#39;s two minifigures, an ugly trike, and some lightning pieces for $13. That&#39;s almost 19 cents per piece!! Terrible value.</p>

<p>The trike looks chunky and isn&#39;t even really a trike since it has four wheels, not three. Such a vehicle never even appeared in the TV show this set is supposed to be based on. If Lego had to make up the vehicle, they could have at least designed it better, although the catapult feature is kinda fun, I suppose. It&#39;s mostly made out of common parts too, so it&#39;s not even a good source of parts. Electro&#39;s spinning platform, however, does have some fairly rare parts, so that&#39;s good, but not enough to warrant the high price tag. Both can be built within a few minutes, so there&#39;s hardly any building experience.</p>

<p>Spider-Man is the exact same one as in every other set in this theme, so unless this is your first Spider-Man set, he&#39;s useless. The only redeeming aspect of this set is the exclusive Electro minifig which is based on the Ultimate Spider-Man cartoon and actually looks pretty cool with those transparent arms and head.</p>

<p>Kids might have some fun with this set as it does have a few play features and the Electro fig is pretty cool, but I can&#39;t recommend this set. It&#39;s just an overpriced cash-in on the Amazing Spider-Man 2 movie that was released around the same time and also featured Electro. I&#39;d say skip it and get one of the $20 sets instead and try to get Electro for less money from bricklink or something if you really have to have him.</p>

"Jelvyc","2014-03-11T02:44:51.86Z","Ultimate Electro!","<p>Any Marvel fan including myself would not pass this set up and as a LEGO collector it&#39;s a good addition.</p>

<p>Easily the best thing about this set is Electro. Great, now we have two members for a Lego Sinister Six. Giving a aerodynamic electric platform is clever.</p>

<p>Spider-Man is of course included. Which is actually good to have the same Spider-Man figure over and over again since it will build up a Clone Saga. I still have the 2004 version of Spider-Man and I often use that as the real Spider-Man to fight off the Spider-Clones.</p>

<p>The Spider-Trike can be good to give to Iron Fist. Since Luke Cage has the Spider-Copter, Nova can fly by himself and Spider-Man already has a Spider-Cycle from the ever awesome set which included Venom and Nick Fury.</p>

<p>Overall, a great adjustable set for any collector.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Arvo-FS, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>Comes in a small box with neat artwork. makes a good trash can after i opened my lego movie minifigures.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>standard parts. nothing exiting except&nbsp;for the elecricity pieces and the piece that connects the back wheels.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spider-man: The standard Spider-man we&#39;ve&nbsp;been getting for all of the Spider-man sets. But still a good figure.</p>

<p>Electro: Amazing is all i have to say for this figure. However ill describe it more for you. the printing is great and you get the head and arms in transparent. This set is worth it just for this minifig. I say that like you actually would want the set for the set.( You probably wont)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun for how small it is. Only took me like 10 minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set is nothing special. Again, Spider-man has a vehicle which he shouldn&#39;t. This is fine for a kid but not a fan of Spider-man who knows that he doesn&#39;t ride vehicles. Electro&#39;s glider is very neat but not much. (not that it needed to be.)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is worth $12 just for Electro. The trike isn&#39;t&nbsp;much and we all have like 3 of Spidey, but Electro makes it worth it.</p>
