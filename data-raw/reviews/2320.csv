"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-03T15:53:04Z","nice set with good features, a little open though","a very sleek design, with a cool cage thing and cool bubble cockpit. clever way on how it transforms, yet it has lots of open spaces. could be good use as a recon vehicle. overall, a very good set for anyone interested or is my age.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-09T20:39:15Z","Pretty good but juniorized!","    This set is top stuff. Or, it can be top dolllar if they didnt juniorize the heck out of it. The drill is cool and I love alpha mode, transformation works like a charm! I like the control canopies but why is this control canopy the same as in the Ble Eagle fighter plane. It just is wierd.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-29T11:28:58Z","Ok Set.....","I have to agree with some of these people...this set is very juiorized but, it is a technic juniorization....When i was building this set i lost one of those small black pieces and i tried to get around it, but because of it i couldn't
-Put on Wheels
-Hard to manage the transforming modes

But this set still spoke to me in Wal mart....So i picked it up because my mom would not let me get a $30 Fire Station, but wait til next time....And one question: Where are the City sets sold?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-01T17:13:49Z","Okay, Give me another shot at this.","I'll wright a longer review for this. Me last one wa very short.

RADIA FIG:

10/10. She is the lasers specilest. Lasers rool.

DIAMOND TOOTH FIG:

10/10. Me favorite ALPHA TEAM mini-figure. HE is the cutting and drilling expert.

TUNDRA TRACKER:

10/10. No complaints from me. Too bad it only got in the LEGO magazine comic 3 times. It never really did anything in the comic, either.

MAGMA DRIL (Alpha Mode)

10/10. Great. It is called the magma drill in the new ALPHA TEAM game at LEGO.com.

ICE ORB:

9/10. Could use more of them. I like how they steal the heat from the air. P.S.:: I built Ogel's time freeze ray.

ICE BLOCK: 10/10. GREAT parts to it.

ENd.

P.S.: Did you guys read the ALPHA TEAM Comic lately? WHO WILL WIN!?!?! I sent in something for the contest.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-18T20:30:11Z","best alpha team set yet!","this set rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
My mom bought it for me at super store only for $7.oo. I like how the magma drill realy drills into the ice block.
If you drill in the beatle it actavates the ice orb. But if you drill into the droll picture you can free raidia!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-23T15:31:46Z","Best Action Feature of the Wave!","This is so much fun to build, and looks great when completed.

Reasonably priced with 2 great minifigs!

Only gets an 8, cause there's only space for one fig in the car, AND there's no Ogel Minion.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MasterBuilder","2009-01-07T08:38:26.687Z","Come on drill me outta here! Im cold!","This set was pretty good because it had two different components, something that helps playability because you can vary your storyline. The Tundra Tracker itself was fun to build and (agreeing with the guy before meh) looked excellent when finished.

Pros: The drill thing on the bottom of the truck
The ice sculpture that had Radia I think in it.
Also the tires and orange fiber-optic element.
Then of course the weird decoder thing.

Cons: Well, ok the set had two minifigs which was good for something small like this but it might have been slightly better off with an Ogel minion guy to freeze up the person in the first place.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alemas","2009-05-20T13:57:54.2Z","Cool set! (Pun intended)","The Tundra Tracker is my first and only Alpha Team set! The set is great, with two rare ice block pieces, and ice orb, Alpha Mode, and a drill!

Pros:

Alpha Mode
Drill
Rare ice block pieces
Diamond Tooth and Radia
Ice orb
Windshield pieces with red lens
Tundra Tracker has space for both minifigs

Cons:

None!

Overall, a cool set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
