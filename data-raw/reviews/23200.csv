<p>The box is quite colorful with &quot;comic&quot; themed font on the front and side and back. A minifig&nbsp;spider-man on the front and the real deal on the side. There is no mistaking what &nbsp;comes in this set.</p>

<p>The three minifigs are included with their names, the poor truck driver doesn&#39;t get a real name, he is forever known&nbsp;as &quot;Truck Driver&quot;.</p>

<p>The back of the box shows all of the movable parts to the set. The exploding back section of the armored car, the roof that opens and the spider web next to the lamp pole that catapults our red and blue hero into action (or the truck driver if he wants to fight back after being pulled out of the truck by Doc Ock).</p>

<p>I grew up with Lego at a time where each step in the instructions had a minimum of 5 pieces and did not include a part list. If you had poor eyesight or concentration you likely missed a piece or two and had to go back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions for this set were straight forward and easy for my to complete.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The majority of the parts are green, black or gray. The set included two diamonds, a gold rock crystal and a few pieces of money.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spider-man - has to be the easiest super hero to produce, he has a head, body and legs, that&#39;s it. Printing on both sides.</p>

<p>Doc Ock - Good build for this minifig. I just don&#39;t like the piece his appendages attach to. It seems to be thicker than a backpack or life preserver and gives him a tall looking &quot;neck&quot; when you look at the minifig straight on. He has a two-sided head and printing on both sides and on his pants.</p>

<p>Truck Driver - Simple minifig, he comes sporting his serious face. Printing only on one side of the body, but when your name is &quot;Truck Driver&quot; that is to be expected.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty easy build. First is the catapult and Doc Ock&#39;s&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">appendages and then on to the armored truck. Oh... stickers.</span></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great. I like the included catapult as it acts as a small set piece to remind you this is in the city. The armored truck is a good size in relation to the rest of the city vehicles. The only part I can nitpick about is the back of the truck. It doesn&#39;t look like an armored truck from the back. But who am I to complain?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set for the Spider-man fan or for someone looking to add an armored truck to their city.</p>

"Tyrell_Archer","2014-07-13T16:43:31.153Z","A good step forward for LEGO Marvel","<p>I initially questioned whether I needed this set for my City. &nbsp;After all, I have a few Spider-Mans (Spider-Men?), I already have a Doctor Octopus from his lab set, and the armored&nbsp;truck is attractive but not a critical addition to a city setup. &nbsp;However, I picked this set up for one primary reason: It&#39;s the first Spider-Man set from the comics, as opposed to the cartoon.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typically for Marvel sets, the box is colourful and highlights the play features. &nbsp;Instructions are also typical for this level of set; with overly simplified&nbsp;steps (ie, one or two pieces per page). &nbsp;If the instructions were made at an AFOL level, it would be more of a pamphlet, and at any rate the instructions must be as accessible as possible. &nbsp;So, no complaints here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing particularly unique here, aside from Dr. Octopus&#39; tentacle attachment, which is not new but often hard to find.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spider-Man: &nbsp;Nothing new or unique here; Spidey is in his classic red and blues. &nbsp;It would be nice to start seeing some other variants of his costume at some point, but this set was not the right place for it, as this is a comic based set.</p>

<p>Bank Guard: &nbsp;Again, nothing that hasn&#39;t been seen before. &nbsp;My only suggestion here is that a different skin tone could have been considered, since thanks to several other sets (ie, Batman) we now have an army of European descended security guards. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Doctor Octopus: &nbsp;The best minifig of the set, Ock is here based not on a movie, or the cartoon, but on his iconic appearance in the comics. &nbsp;Ock has adopted many looks over the years (including, notably, Spider-Man himself), but the green/yellow and lab coat is the traditional comic look for this classic character. &nbsp;His hair is, as Spidey has said in the past, Moe Howard-esque and looks great (for him!). &nbsp;The tentacles are unchanged from prior minifigs, which is not a bad thing, but could use an update. &nbsp;I plan to upgrade the tentacles by adding moving pincers to two arms, and adding to the length. &nbsp;I&#39;m also going to see if I can experiment with the articulation by adding a rotation. &nbsp;Of course, the arms may end up looking too long, but it&#39;s worth the experiment.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing spectacular here. &nbsp;If you&#39;re looking for a unique building experience, you&#39;ll have to go elsewhere, I&#39;m afraid. &nbsp;The one really interesting step involved the &quot;explosion&quot; play feature; fitting the four lockboxes in and setting up the explosive feature was a slight offshoot from the norm.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The truck looks terrific in the end, with an &quot;explosive&quot; play feature that helps Doc&#39;s dynamite look like it&#39;s actually working. &nbsp;Unfortunately, the streetlight/spider web feature, which is meant to let Spider-Man jump into battle, allows more of a stumble at best. &nbsp;It&#39;s difficult to set Spidey up on the web so he doesn&#39;t fall off, and when it&nbsp;does work the effect is not worth it. &nbsp;I&#39;d rather have seen a simple&nbsp;webswinging feature that allows Spider-Man to webswing to the scene of the crime.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While this set is not necessarily unique or special to the LEGO Marvel line, the appeal is more about what the set represents. &nbsp;The Doctor Octopus here is the best representation of the character yet, dressed in his iconic garb, rather than based on the cartoon. &nbsp;Combined with the Captain America HYDRA set, and the X-Men Sentinel set, this represents a new shift towards the comics themselves as inspiration, and I for one couldn&#39;t be more pleased. &nbsp;Hopefully this will lead towards more comic based figures and sets (Captain Marvel! &nbsp;Nightcrawler! &nbsp;The Fantastic Four!), to appeal to longtime Marvel fans and kids alike.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T15:27:20.58Z","Catch a Spider with an Octopus","<p><strong>Set #76015 Doc Ock Truck Heist: </strong>A Marvel set from 2014, this particular set is a nice small set with some interesting Minifigures and a regular vehicle for New York City to display on top of the new Bridge set coming out in August.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: Your standard Marvel Super Heroes box design, this one has the sub-tag of Marvel Ultimate Spider-Man. The front shows Spidey in action with a great fun action scene featuring the set, that back shows all the play features and regular features of the set in a concise and straight forward fashion. Overall great design as always.</p>

<p>Instructions: The instructions include detailed step-by-step build indicators for each of the two numbered bags found in the set. A cross promotional image of the sets from the Ultimate Spidey sub-theme of 2014 and a parts list, as well as an add for the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes videogame.</p>

<p>Comic Book: Like with all larger Marvel Super Hero sets you&rsquo;ll find a comic included with this set, this shows all three Spidey sets in action and a back cover with a shot of all the Minifigures from 2013 and 2014&rsquo;s first initial wave of sets.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Nothing much stands out to me here, standard LEGO parts are what you&rsquo;ll find here with nothing truly rare or impressive as a stand out element. Perhaps the web element, if you don&rsquo;t already have a lot of them.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Doc Ock: The stand out Minifigure from this set is Doctor Otto Octavius, also known as Doctor Octopus, one of Spidey&rsquo;s more notorious rogue&rsquo;s gallery members. He&rsquo;s been made a few times before in LEGO form, once for LEGO Spider-Man 2 and again in a relatively hard to come by set from 2012 which was a store exclusive.</p>

<p>Ocky here, as Spidey tends to call him, features a decent looking comic accurate print of his traditional green costume with a white lab coat over it, which carries down to his legs for some leg printing. His four arms are built up using standard click joint pieces and droid arms from Exo-Force, and they look great, they do make him a bit back heavy, but can be positioned in numerous ways to offset this issue.</p>

<p>His hair piece hides the double-sided expression, as one is furious and the other is gloating with triumph for stealing the money and jewels found in the back of the truck. It is Ron Weasley&rsquo;s hair piece in brown. He includes a stick of dynamite as an accessory to blow up the back of the truck.</p>

<p>Spider-Man: The same Minifigure we&rsquo;ve come to expect in Spider-Man sets, it&rsquo;s been the same look and print since&hellip; I think 2012 or even earlier, it&rsquo;s a bit of a shame considering Iron Man and Cap at least get some different colors and prints to differentiate their various costumes. However Spidey is one of the most iconic looking heroes and much like Superman or Batman rarely changes clothes. It would be nice if LEGO just printed the arms and legs already so his costume print went all the way down like it&rsquo;s supposed to though.</p>

<p>Truck Driver: This Minifigure looks pretty much the same as the Security Guard we&rsquo;ve seen before in DC sets. The police outfit and hat are fairly standard for these guys, he even has Lex&rsquo;s scowling face, which has been used for Stormtroopers a lot so often I have to wonder if this is just a Stormtrooper moonlighting at another job. Heh, much like with Spidey he has no accessories.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: You get to start building the Secure Transport vehicle in this bag as well as a streetlight with some spider webbing to catch Doc Ock with, the build is fairly simple and doesn&rsquo;t involve a whole lot of pieces. The foundation of the security truck is what you&rsquo;d expect from a vehicle of this size, there is very little to do here.</p>

<p>Bag 2: This portion of the build completes the truck, which doesn&rsquo;t really involve anything difficult. There are sticker placements for detailing of course, and the image for what you build does miss out on the fact that you complete the entire model, there is still a gap in the back that you might think isn&rsquo;t built, but that&rsquo;s part of the play feature and will be discussed shortly. For a 25$ set this build is pretty quick and you might think lacking due to the number of pieces found here.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The streetlight model is rather lackluster, for an add-on element for play features it isn&rsquo;t very well thought out. And the spider web just sticking out there is kind of ugly. The TMNT sets have handled street corners with lights much better.</p>

<p>The security transport truck is a solid looking model whose only issue stems from the play feature. It&rsquo;s actually a hollow looking truck with no real back, because you place four separate &lsquo;safes&rsquo; in the back, and then to simulate Doc Ock breaking in to steal the contents you push down hard on a hinged plate slightly sticking out. This sends all four safes flying, as if they&rsquo;ve been blow out of the truck. In theory at any rate, the portion sticking out of the back is too short to hit it hard enough to actually flip the safes out.</p>

<p>This play feature element compromises an otherwise decent looking truck model, because of it you have a huge gap open in the back of the truck and the four safes do very little, if the model had been made slightly bigger you could have still featured an exploding open truck element, but had the safes be separate from the model so they aren&rsquo;t key to making the entire back of the truck&rsquo;s roof and interior, for which there really isn&rsquo;t any.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This particular set in my mind is ok, it&rsquo;s not the greatest from Super Heroes, however it does work well and is much better compared to the other sets from this year, for one thing it doesn&rsquo;t give Spider-Man a ridiculous vehicle for him to drive around in. And it also includes a decent villain, the model unfortunately is a bit lacking because of the play feature, and the addition of the streetlight is relatively pointless and just there to boost the piece count.</p>

<p>So I&rsquo;d recommend this for folks who want a Doc Ock at a cheaper price point, if you can still find it, it would also look great as another vehicle to add to the section of bridge that is coming out in August&rsquo;s batch of Spidey based sets.</p>

"BushMaoris","2014-11-25T18:57:39.477Z","Doc Ock","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is cardboard with pictures. The instructions tell you how to put the set together</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are kinda meh, you do get a couple of 100 dollar bills, two diamonds and a gold thing but yeah...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spider-man:&nbsp;This is my second one so far and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have an&nbsp;army of him in his red and blue attire soon, I wish they would make a variant.</p>

<p>Truck Driver: Serves his purpose, already got one of these guys from the two-face set a couple of years ago.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fairly short but enjoyable, took me 25 mins i think</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not really impressed with the completed model, this truck is built solely for the &quot;explosion&quot; function so the looks (especially from the back) leave mch to be desired. The web catapult thing is pretty useless, it took me quite a few attempts to get him to go about an inch.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Only get this set if you absolutely love Doc Ock, love the comics or if you want to build an army of identical Spider-Mans, otherwise don&#39;t bother, get the hydra set instead.</p>

"Monkeyman3838","2015-06-08T21:56:35.453Z","Possibly the best Spider-Man set ever!","<p>Spider-Man finally has an arch-nemesis!!!!!!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is about a foot long and six inches long. There&#39;s only one instruction manual which is normal for a $19.99 set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Amazing parts. Very good selection of&nbsp;Technic pins, also. A spider web is included, along with 100 dollar bills and diamonds and gold pieces. My&nbsp;favorite part is the windshield, which is exclusive to this set.&nbsp;The&nbsp;glass clicks into the&nbsp;casing very well.&nbsp;The only thing wrong with it is that some of the main parts of the truck are STICKERED!!!!!!!!!! I suggest (if you cannot apply stickers well) to ask help from someone who can. On to the minifigures!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spiderman is just the regular, generic Spidey.&nbsp;The same goes for the truck driver. The most sought-after minifigure in this set is definitely Doc-Ock. His arms are amazing, giving him wonderful playability. His head is double sided, one with a snarky grin, and the other with a determined snarl.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build only took me about 20 minutes, and the longest part was definitely Doc-Ock&#39;s arms. Very repetitive. The section above the cab of the truck can flip up, allowing playability and a good way to put the driver in. I think the light with the spider web&nbsp;is unnecessary, although adds some extra playability. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall, great set. Also, those safes fling up when you push a&nbsp;black thing underneath the safes. This is unnecessary, also, and you can&#39;t really flip it upside down :( Which is kind of sad.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set! Doc-Ock is a great figure, and this set is really a must-have!!! :)</p>
