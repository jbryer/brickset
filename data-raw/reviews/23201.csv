<p>For those of you who haven&#39;t read my other reviews, I generally don&#39;t have much to say about the boxes, the back showed the play features, the front set the scene, and it folded up very easily when I was recycling it.<br />
<br />
The instructions didn&#39;t have any misprints, and it came with a comic I&#39;m pretty sure, although it&#39;s been a little while since I flattened out and stored the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll address this right now: The number of parts for the cost is terrible.<br />
<br />
However, the pieces that are included have some value to them. The large wheel/side rotor pieces are useful, similar to the Avenger&#39;s Quinjet, there are two different shaped cockpit pieces, and various grey, blue and red angled pieces that I haven&#39;t seen too many of. There are also something like 6 flick missiles if you require more as well, and a white net. I haven&#39;t seen a lot of the nets in this colour, and although a quick fact check will probably prove it is not unique to this set, it is unique to the sets in my collection.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Mary Jane Watson</strong> is included, in a black sleeveless shirt with a Spider-man themed heart on the front of it (the heck? That&#39;s pretty meta), is a long awaited inclusion, as she has been a long time character in the Spider-man universe. She has single colour pants, and the usual Marvel red hair (Pepper Potts, Jean Grey, etc), with the piece being the same as Peppers.<br />
<br />
Carl Lucas aka Luke Cage aka <strong>Power Man</strong> has been a long awaited minifigure for me, as I have no context for Iron Fist (of Doc Ock&#39;s Lab fame) outside of being Power Man&#39;s partner. His headband is printed on his single sided head, and his outfit is a well printed yellow and black combination.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">His inclusion, as I have found out between reviews of the Spider-man sets, is due to a Marvel cartoon version of our favorite web slinging super hero, Ultimate Spider-man. I&#39;m still not familiar with this source material, but it looks like this is the reason for the seemingly random inclusion of Nova and Iron Fist (part of Spider-mans team along with Power Man and White Tiger) in previous sets over well known Spider-man partners such as the Human Torch or Black Cat. This also clarified my question as to why Spider-man all the sudden has a Batman sized arsenal of helicopters, motorcycles, planes, trains and automobiles.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><strong>Spider-man</strong> is also (obviously, from the title of the set) included. The same costume, same web piece, same everything, but he is still a very well done figure. I&#39;m just bored that I have either 6 or 7 of him now.</span><br />
<br />
The <strong>Green Goblin</strong> figure makes me feel how disconnected from the source material for these sets I really am. I remember him being only marginally larger, or even the same size, as Spider-man, but because there is finally a villain to stand up to the Hulk, I applaud his inclusion. The same format as the Troll/Goblin King/Hulk, but the torso/legs, head and I think even the arms have been slightly modified to make him look like he has armor on. He is an olive green, with a black and non reflective silver armor/clothing. He looks incredibly sinister, especially with the detail put into his focused eyes, gritting teeth and pointed ears and nose.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The first section of the build is the Goblin&#39;s glider, which comic, movie or 90&#39;s cartoon purists will recognize. Dark grey, light grey with a little black and olive green are the colours, it has two flick missiles, boosters and some angled technic connectors to give the wings their bent looks. I am a little disappointed with the lack of pumpkin bombs, but I&#39;ll go out on a limb and say they aren&#39;t part of the Ultimate Spider-man mythology. It&#39;s a cool glider, and being part of the character, and the already low piece count, I&#39;d say it had to be included. Once more, it is a great, iconic vehicle.</p>

<p>The build itself is pretty quick, and I&#39;m willing to bet that many MOCs have been done just by looking at it.</p>

<p>The Spider-copter looks like something out of Avatar. It&#39;s different, I will say that. It has two separate&nbsp;cockpits, one for Power Man and one for Spider-man, the latter of which has a technic pin and attachment&nbsp;for Spider-man&#39;s web, so he can &quot;jump&quot; out of the copter and pursue the Green Goblin. The rest of the main body is made up of two &quot;wings&quot;, which have two launchers, one for four flick missiles launched in pairs, the other for an unreliable web launcher, ending in large technic style &quot;wheel&quot; pieces with their own rotors. These &quot;wheels&quot; rotate too, for maneuverability&nbsp;I suppose. The top rotor and tail are the last completed parts of copter, and have smaller &quot;fan&quot; pieces on the tail, and larger rotor pieces for the main rotor.</p>

<p>Because of the number and size (that blue, long angled piece, the cockpit covers, the &quot;wheel&quot; rotors), it is a quick build. The two &quot;launchers&quot; are also slightly different, so follow the instructions so that you don&#39;t miss something, as I did simply mirroring the build for the web launcher from the missile launcher. There are some technic pins and pieces involved, but nothing revolutionary in the build process.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As far as the Spider-man vehicles go, this one is my favorite. Part of it might be the colour, size and amount I spent on it, part of it is likely the discovery that TLG isn&#39;t just pumping out Spider-man themed vehicles to rob us (alright, me) of money for superfluous vehicles, as there is a source for them.</p>

<p>The top rotor occasionally needs maintenance, but both completed aircraft have a lot of play value, and are very swooshable. There are some great play features, such as the net launcher and the Spider-man&#39;s swing from inside the copter, that I haven&#39;t seen in such a small set.</p>

<p>You can display it or play with it with equal ease. It&#39;s a wonderful little set. However...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>...I bought this set for $55 dollars Canadian.</p>

<p>I understand there is a lot of overhead for a set like this. A new mold for the Green Goblin, the design of the minifigures (not to mention the paint on them), the design on of the set, the &quot;character&quot; price increase, the licensing costs...it all adds to the cost of a set. I get that, I&#39;m sure many of you reading this get that.</p>

<p>However, both Hulk sets, as an example from a similarly licensed and priced set, got a lot more value for their respective sets in terms of product, without losing play value or value in the design of the set.</p>

<p>This mars my overall opinion of the set. That is really too bad, because it is well designed, would have a lot of play value, and even includes some rare-ish pieces. The cost per piece isn&#39;t usually a beef of mine, I look at the set as a whole, but this is just a glaring problem for me.</p>

<p>If the Green Goblin were included in a larger set, and the Spider-copter had another, smaller villain, this would have worked. Conversely, throwing another regular villain (or even generic security guard) from this series with a vehicle or small base of their own would have offset the cost.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re new to the Spider-man theme and looking for your first set, get the Daily Bugle set from last year. If you&#39;re already knee deep or higher, wait for a sale.&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16.363636016845703px;"">Then again, I bought this set, full price, and it is a well designed and fun toy or model. Furthermore, I don&#39;t regret it, because this was my last Superhero set to buy from this wave, and I am, if nothing else, a&nbsp;</span>completionist<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16.363636016845703px;"">. I want more people to buy this set, and 7 year old me would freak out over getting a cool toy like this for my birthday, but my advice would be to wait for it to go on sale, as even 10 or 15 dollars off ($40 or $45 Canadian) would make it a lot easier to purchase.</span></p>
