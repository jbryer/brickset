"Turtlemoht","2015-10-06T10:50:46.857Z","Great little scene","<p>For a small set, this captures a great scene and includes two key characters.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve long-since discarded the box to this set but it wasn&#39;t particularly remarkable in the first place. All LEGO packaging is bright and shows the contents in action and the TMNT sets use a nice olive/yellow color palette that suits the show beautifully.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a small set but you do get some interesting pieces: a&nbsp;large motorbike in black, skateboard in blue and a short rope.</p>

<p>There are several other pieces that are made interesting with stickers: two street signs (Broadway and Bleeker), a NYC manhole cover and red and white striped roadworks signs. I&#39;m not a fan of stickers, but while it would be preferable for these to be printed, they&#39;re still a nice addition to any street scene.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures here are the highlight. There are only two but both are unique.</p>

<p>Karai is a critical character from this version of the show. Unlike prior TMNT&nbsp;timelines, Karai is Splinter&#39;s daughter in this telling, and has been raised by Shredder as part of his attempt to destroy all that his old rival holds dear.&nbsp;When the truth comes out, Karai becomes a swing character, fighting both with and against the turtles under various circumstances.</p>

<p>Her figure is a little over-sized when compared to her appearance in the show. However, this is simply due to LEGO&#39;s minifigure dimensions. Her appearance (dual sided head, armor and hair) are all accurate and, from what I can tell, the hair piece is unique.</p>

<p>While there are several versions of Leonardo, this is the best, in my opinion. Only the head is unique but the expression and &#39;battle damage&#39; scuff marks really show that Leo has seen some action. Also, many of the TMNT&nbsp;turtle characters are looking up, I assume so that they can be running forward at a sharp angle as they do in the show. This isn&#39;t the case here, which I think is preferable.</p>

<p>Followers of the TMNT will know that Leo is a repeat offender when it comes to large brawls when he&#39;s outnumbered. In the current iteration, the show also&nbsp;has a wonderful retelling of the &#39;coma&#39; plot line from the&nbsp;1990 movie but with Leo out of action for weeks (or months) after an incident. This figure is accurate to the chase scene it is depicting and also useful for action scenes in general.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There&#39;s not much to say about the build. It&#39;s very straight forward with just a bike and very small street corner to construct. The building techniques are nothing particularly special with the possible exception of the roadwork sign, which connects three pieces in a clever way to make the a-frame shape with a light on top.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the bike is a little over-built. However, it&#39;s a simple matter to dial back the overly large details.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The scene is small but the action feature (exploding newspaper booth) works well. For a set of this size, it&#39;s more important that the set can contribute to larger scenes, and this one absolutely does. The street corner will fit in nicely on anyone&#39;s LEGO street.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t&nbsp;have a LEGO street to add this to,&nbsp;&nbsp;you can still have a lot of fun with the tow-rope feature. Connect Leo on his skateboard to Karai&#39;s bike and you can run the pair across your desk, couch or wherever you like.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is all about the figures. Both are great. On the other hand,&nbsp;the build is very simple&nbsp;and&nbsp;there are lots many stickers that would be better printed.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the figures are great,&nbsp;the scene it&#39;s depicting is presented well and&nbsp;the action features work well. Stickers aside,&nbsp;this set is fantastic for it&#39;s price.</p>

If you&rsquo;ve been hoping to pick up Karai as a Minifigure than this is the set for you. There&rsquo;s also some uninspired builds in it, we&rsquo;re going to discuss them all during the course of this review.</span></span></span></span></p>

However, the print does something different, it includes loads of scratches and scuff marks that indicate battle damage for the leader of the turtles. This is an awesome change to the print and really makes Leo stand out, considering he&rsquo;s one of the only Turtles from the 2014 wave that didn&rsquo;t include new outfits like his brother. Or at least as many new outfits as his brothers did.</span></span></span></span></p>

He also has a small rope to attach to Karai&rsquo;s bike so he can follow her.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s nice to see LEGO managed to get this fan favorite character out before they lost the license to the Theme. One of only two female Minifigures included in the Theme as well and in a cheap set too, much easier to get than the April minifig.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Karai has leg printing, a double-sided torso with her awesome looking outfit, her head is a double-sided face with neutral and angry expressions and her head piece or hair is a newly sculpted piece using the softer rubbery plastic hair. Her accessories include the black katana and a brick-built ooze canister. She also comes with an alternate bike helmet (for safety) in black sadly without any printing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">First comes Karai&rsquo;s Bike, this involves very minimal building. It&rsquo;s pretty much a bike, you add a few extra elements. There&rsquo;s a front extended headlight, a bulkier back where the helmet can hang and a side build that might be an extra exhaust pipe or a weapon for Karai. Personally I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s just an extra exhaust pipe. The bike includes two stickers for details, it&rsquo;s really frustrating here since it would make more sense to include a printed element here.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">A small micro-build includes sticker detailing as well which is basically a road blockade to prevent Karai&rsquo;s escape. It&rsquo;s not much to discuss really, but it is a nice addition to the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The final aspect of the model is pretty impressive. It&rsquo;s much more involved because it includes a large newspaper dispenser, which is in yellow. I guess that&rsquo;s the colour for them in New York? I&rsquo;ve never been. The model is nice, it features a fire hydrant next to a street sign, and includes a small manhole cover. Which is another sticker placed on a LEGO element. Honestly for a set this small I can&rsquo;t understand why they didn&rsquo;t just go with printed detailing. It would have made the street sign more impressive and more useful for MOC fans, since then you could add them into a large New York build. The corner of Broadway and Bleecker.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The street sign is part of the play feature, it&rsquo;s attached to a Technic axle and when you pull it down the paper machine explodes. Not very useful for stopping Karai, but it adds a bit of play value to an otherwise limited play feature set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As far as cheap TMNT sets go this one isn&rsquo;t terrible. It includes some awesome looking Minifigures with great printed detailing, a few interesting builds that fit in well with a New York display. Could go anywhere really, even a Marvel display. The price isn&rsquo;t bad either, however there are a few issues, I am not a fan of giving a small set like this stickers as opposed to printed pieces. For a set this small I&rsquo;m not sure how much you could save on costs by using stickers instead of printed elements. The bike piece may be a bit larger for printed elements, but printed street signs would have been nicer to see here, and also the manhole cover would be a much more useful element with printing. (Considering you could then use this piece in the Marvel Theme.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The play feature is minor and rather unimaginative. It might have been more interesting to create a different model to incorporate a better play idea, since it&rsquo;s pretty much the exact same play feature they&rsquo;ve done many times over. Also compared to the previous year&rsquo;s small set there really isn&rsquo;t as much to do here as there could have been. At least toss in a third Minifigure, a Foot Soldier on a pursuing vehicle would have made for an excellent additional play feature.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">In the end I recommend this for fans who want Karai to go with the rest of their TMNT characters and minifigs. But as far as sets go, it isn&rsquo;t as fun as it could have been. Although I must admit Karai&rsquo;s bike is a stellar vehicle build and I love the all dark colour scheme.</span></span></span></span></p>
