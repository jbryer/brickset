Sadly though it uses stickers, which many find to be highly frustrating. Personally I think the stickers work nice for this set, mostly because of the way it&rsquo;s built.</span></span></span></span></p>

I just wanted to take a moment to talk about the awesome little comic on the back, this one is neat and I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the art style, which I haven&rsquo;t discussed before. Play features for this set are shown quite nicely, and you get to see them all in toy form and in comic form.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: This set breaks up the build in numbered bags and takes that one step further by breaking up the instructions in two numbered manuals. The first manual builds the T-Rawket and the second deals with The Kraang flying saucer thing. The cross-promotional images for the sets from this wave and the checklist for the Minifigures in in the back of manual one, the parts lists and the second one has the same images from the back of the box to show off the play feature.</span></span></span></span></p>

Beware of potential damaged or creased stickers.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There isn&rsquo;t much to discuss with this set as far as parts are concerned. Most of them are fairly standard. What stands out to me is the hexagon shaped plate in pink and the two half tube things in green that make up the bulk of the T-Rawket&rsquo;s body. That isn&rsquo;t to say there aren&rsquo;t a lot of great parts in this set, but considering the price of it many of them can be found in cheaper sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Donatello: This version of Donny includes a winter jacket on his torso, colour coded to match his bandana of course. It&rsquo;s a nice looking print with fur-lined collar, walkie-talkie and some sort of device which I&rsquo;m not sure what it&rsquo;s meant to be, but it&rsquo;s a small round metal thing with a red light or control switch.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">He comes with his Bo Staff and what I believe is a Anti-Mutagen Canister, he&rsquo;s trying to save April&rsquo;s mutated father from the fate the Kraang bestowed upon him. His legs don&rsquo;t seem to have any alternative printing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Michelangelo: Wearing a pressurized flight suit, or what appears to be, Mikey has an all new torso and leg print, the torso being double-sided of course. His head has a determined expression, angry too if I had to guess. It&rsquo;s a fun variant of Mikey in minifig form. He includes a Nunchuk which we&rsquo;ve seen before, nothing much else to say here.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Mutated Dr. O&rsquo;Neil: Using the Monster Fighter bat creature torso, this Minifigure is unique to this set and another mutant for the turtles to fight. He&rsquo;s got really odd wings, I mean the rest of the torso is muted with Earth tones, but the wings are made out of bright pink plastic. Now I&rsquo;m not sure if this is accurate to the character, but to me it just seems to clash horribly with the rest of the figure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">He has no accessories, only a single-sided head print and a softer rubbery head piece for his bat ears and hair, or whatever&rsquo;s supposed to be on his head. Not a bad minifig, but not my favorite mutant from this Theme. The leg printing is nice and reminds me of the Chima minifgures with the amount of detail being used, including toes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Kraang: This Minifigure doesn&rsquo;t offer any new printed elements, it&rsquo;s the same as we saw last year in the other sets. But it is nice to have him included, because as always you can&rsquo;t go wrong without an army of them. Sadly he has no accessories to hold.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: This build is the T-Rawket entirely and the two turtles. It&rsquo;s a very impressive build that involves a large number of the pieces of the set, considering the second manual is much thinner and involves a lot less pieces. The T-Rawket is meant to be a pair of old roller coaster cars welded together with some additional elements to allow it to fly. The way you build it is highly impressive and involves a vast majority of the stickers for the details. I don&rsquo;t find anything too difficult with this build, and it&rsquo;s fairly satisfying, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the play feature in the back though, but we&rsquo;ll get to that in the completed model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: This builds the other two Minifigures and the Kraang ship, which takes up much less time and pieces. There is nothing difficult about the build, no repetitive steps and interestingly no real stickers on this build. Just the one for the control panel, this one also includes glow-in-the-dark studs which is pretty interesting.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Kraang Ship: This model is a good, solid, chunky saucer craft. It is fairly impressive looking and the colours fit together quite nicely, the silver and light grey as well as that one pink piece. The sad fact is it can&rsquo;t rotate, now that&rsquo;s probably not a deal breaker when it comes to this set, but the saucer top looks like it should be able to rotate on the box, when in fact the build doesn&rsquo;t include that. And the reason why? It features a play feature bomb dropping ooze canister launcher underneath, if it rotated this feature wouldn&rsquo;t work nearly as well as it does.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">You also have flick-fire missiles and glow-in-the-dark studs. I don&rsquo;t understand why LEGO used a sticker for the control panel, especially when we&rsquo;ve seen many printed elements for control panels in LEGO Space sets. Still a solid model and really fun to play with.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">T-Rawket: This vehicle is weird, quirky and awesome! From what little I know of the show this is apparently made using roller coaster cars, and in my book that&rsquo;s an awesome choice for the Turtles to make a vehicle out of. It&rsquo;s unique and new compared to the old school vehicles I&rsquo;m more familiar with from the 80&rsquo;s series.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This thing is loaded with impressive details, and for an open aired vehicle with limited build elements that&rsquo;s saying much. The wings and rear engine look like it was cobbled together by Donny with spare parts. The play features include two flick-fire missiles and a pizza launching oven attached to the back. The biggest disappointment is the reliance on stickers for the detailing, they are nicely printed and work well, unfortunately having actual printed pieces would have made the set far more impressive. Especially for the control panels.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">A small glider is also built for Michelangelo which he can use to leap off the back and fly by himself after the Kraang or Dr. O&rsquo;Neil. It&rsquo;s a sweet looking microbuild and fits in with the cobbled together look of the turtles side of this set compared to the more mechanical techno-savvy looking build of the Kraang vehicle.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">In the end I recommend this set as one of the more impressive builds from the Theme. While it does have lots of stickers, they aren&rsquo;t a deal breaker in my case, and I think the models are both solid looking vehicles. The T-Rawket is fairly long, so it will stick out if you don&rsquo;t have a good sized shelf to put it on when not in play. But still a great set, and with some pretty decent Minifigures.</span></span></span></span></p>
