(yeah, i know i use weird language. it's genetic). I mean, it's just bad. The spider thingy though is a neato idea. I also like the evil henchmen, too. But honestly, doesn't it look like Dash got morphed or something? He looks like he has facial hair. That's just wrong!! He looks kinda grimacy and more likely than not, drunk!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-11T00:08:12Z","very good","This is a very good set, the red buglike thing is kinda wierd, and wings pop out the back so it can fly.Then raise the butt of the bug and by a leaver flings a ice orb out It also looks like the bug on the ice orbs. The plane is cool as a plane with a claw that comes down by a lever. your sopposed to grab that radar thingy off the bug, then the head pops off. I dont really like that it only comes with 1 ice orb. i would have 2 or 3 in the set, but i already have 12 so im not really complaining. O ya, and the thing that the plane transforms into doesnt look good, its to... well...   if you get the set and transform the plane you will see what i mean.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-25T17:11:50Z","Just as good as all other Alpha Teams...","SWELL! I love how they use those weird Bionicle peices and do something GREAT out of them. I have nothing but Preaise for the LEGO CoMPANY

PLAYABILITY:

15/10 I know that's not possible, but it rules! VERY fun! I love it!

DASH JUSTICE:

10/10; Better than the old one!

Skeliton Drone:

9/10; not enough. If they could put in 1 more on this set, like, working the orb chucher in the back, that would rule.

BLUE EAGLE:

10/10! Swell! VERY playable. Eagle Claw, the thingy in the back, is great! works like a charm! YOu can use it to take the head off of the Snow Crawler.

ICE GLIDER (Blue Eagle's Alpha Mode):

9/10. Great, but falls over alot. Great for land chases with the Snow Crawler.

Snow Clawler land mode:

10/10 Excellent. Eady to transform. It spits out ice orbs, which steal heat from mid-air. Chucker works okay.

AIR MODE:

10/10. Snow crawler rocks. Hard.

This thing is cool and all, but it is 30 daggone dollars. The plane has an odd design and looks much, much better from the front. The cockpit pieces are very neat and so is the small canopy! The Dash included has a cool icy AT suit but what the heck did they do with his head! From Mission Deep Sea to tghis set, they made him look like he has a desease, sheesh, they make it look like he is being electrocuted,and what happened to the Alphjqa Team? Where is Charge and Cam? the replacements look like they have mange too! Anyway, this set is much better as a spy plane and it looks much better when you take the landing gear off! Whew! Oh yeah, the orb thing is neat too. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"omgbrick","2008-01-03T19:59:04.247Z","The one taloned Eagle","The Blue Eagle was about forty dollars so this wasn't the biggest Alpha Team set but it contained one of Ogels Ice drones with a vehicle. There are two minifigs Dash wearing a new jumpsuit with both printed legs and torso he has a flat top hair piece. Ogel's drone is similar to the ones from the &quot;Deep Sea&quot; theme except he has a clear helmet with an insect printed on his torso.
The box is like other Alpha Team boxes and has a little picture in the corner that shows the vehicle transforming. With that said Dashs plane can transform into a sort of skiing thing (I don't know what to call it.). To do this you fold down the wings, engines, and the cockpit which forms a sort of rectangle that has some Bionicle style skis on the bottom of it. The cockpit is made out of three parts (juniorization) the bottom, top, and window. You'll notice on the window there’s a transparent red square if you look at one of the Ice orbs through this you'll see an insect shape like the one on Ogels drone. In the cockpit there’s a 2 by 2 printed tile with some buttons and a screen on it. The main feature for the Blue Eagle is a Bionicle Talon that snaps down to grab part of the Drones vehicle to make it fall apart. You only have to move a lever on the top of the ship which makes the talon sweep down (there’s elastic in it that makes it come back up). 
The drone’s vehicle is built to resemble an ant. In the back there are a couple large plates on click hinges that covers a little ice orb storage area. Two of them also can act as wings for the ship if it needs to fly away from the Blue Eagle. The cockpit is simple it doesn’t cover the drone but does have a printed plate with a picture of the Blue Eagle and some buttons. The cockpit is attached to the main body by a Technic beam with some antennas on it. This is so the blue eagle can use its claw to pull it out causing the cockpit to fall off.
There is only one Ice Orb for the drone to deploy a bit low in my opinion but you can get many others from other Alpha team sets. It is made up of a printed white minifig head on a stud put in a crystal ball with a round dish under it simple but effective.
Overall it’s worth the forty dollars. It has a high playability factor because of the Drone's vehicle. The only Thing I don't like about it is the transformed mode of the Blue Eagle which I can't dock points for. 5/5

"Tri_pod_king","2008-06-22T16:25:14.06Z","The Blue Eagles Are Coming!","I got this set back when it came out and I loved it. Mine is long gone, but I still remember it.
Anyway, on to the review:
                    Minifigs:
                          Dash: Probably the best D. minifig ever. Very detailed. Great minifig, PERIOD.
       
                          Ogel's Drone: The helmet is a pretty transparent blue. Same ol' skull though. The         
                       outfit is well done as far as colors go, though I would've put a bit more detail into it.

                     Vehicles:
                           Blue Eagle: One of the best a.t. rides EVER. The only flaw was that the landing 
                      gear kept on falling off. Otherwise, very stirdy. Great colors. The claw, oh man, the claw 
                     gives it fantastic playability.

                           Snow Crawler: Once again, great colors. It has med. playability, though a bit flimsy.

                 MORE PROS &amp; CONS:
                                 On the sides of the b.e., I would've made the stickers print-ons.

                                 29.99 is a bit too much. It should've been 19.99.

                                            Party On, Dudes!

Sorry!</p><p><strong>Parts</strong></p><p>Really nice parts, the windshield on the Blue Eagle and the bomb on the red thing were particularly amazing. It comes with those two Kopaka skiis in blue, which is nice. The minifigures were also pretty good. The color scheme, too, is a bit uncommon, which is another plus.</p><p><strong>Playability</strong></p><p>Amazing! The Blue Eagle's transform function worked like a dream. It was sturdy enough so that the wings could fold down without shattering, unlike some other sets...anyway, I had one issues with this set: The Blue Eagle had issues picking up the red crawler thing. When it actually worked, the red thing split beautifully.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah, that's the review. Hope it helps!</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4
