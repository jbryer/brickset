<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>Polybag with small instruction manual (10*7cm) which is one big page with 13 steps.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing to special but good that they included the grab-handles to let the glider stand.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spider-Man! And a good one at that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very short but quite fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Cool glider (but why would Spider-Man need it?) with two white/gray flick-fire missiles&nbsp;and a very good Spider-Man.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like that this polybag allows you to get a Spider-Man very cheaply and also gives you a glider.</p>

Unfortunately compared to last years offerings in the Polybag department this time we&#39;re getting a slightly weaker looking set.</p>

<p>Spider-Man is now imitating the Green Goblin, he&#39;s got his very own personalized glider. An impressive build using the iconic colours of red and blue, with some medium stone gray tossed in to break up the colours. And including the flick-fire missile launchers. The glider is a solid build from a Polybag and doesn&#39;t have anything really against it. My main problem with this set is the character choice. While I understand the popularity of Spidey I can&#39;t understand why LEGO would want to include him in so many sets this year, on top of that the Mini-Figure isn&#39;t unique.</p>

<p>If they&#39;d given him a new uniform from one of the countless other&#39;s he&#39;s used in the comics over the decades it might have been a better overall offering. Especially if they used the Iron-Spidey look or the Fantastic Four all white get-up. But this exact same mini-figure has been released in almost 10 sets now and while iconic it is by no means the only variant of the costume he&#39;s worn.</p>

<p>Overall, while I do like the glider, I mean despite the fact that it&#39;s rather pointless since Spider-Man webslings everywhere, the fact that the Mini-Figure is not unique really hurts the rating on this polybag. I would recommend it for fans of the character if they just want all that LEGO Spider-Man has to offer, fans of polybags who collect them all and never skip any of them and parents looking for a decent little gift at retail for their kids. If you really don&#39;t care for the set, or would rather bricklink the parts for the glider, as nothing is unique, go that route. Saves you from owning yet another version of Spider-Man who is fast becoming the Batman of Marvel, at least Batman get&#39;s to wear different costumes occasionally.</p>
