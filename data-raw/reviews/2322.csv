"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-31T09:00:09Z","Cool","This is one of the cooler sets in this Arctic-Alpha Team.
It has brilliant functions, such as the doors opening out, but lousy colors. I mean, it has red on the inside, arctic blue, orange and black on the outside. It's all color-coordinated wrong. Although, the missile launcher is a reedeeming part oof this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-25T23:09:30Z","good","this thig is very good for new colored parts, very good for a kid too. the doors that fall down have a lock mechanism and when it is all folded up the white arm thing with a gun can hold 2 orbs. the colers of the people are purple, light bluish(robot),yellow and red, but i dont know there names.some places fall apart easy when you are pulling down the doors, and the small snomobiles fall apart easy ,mostly in the front. great set,and looks good when your done too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-02T17:06:56Z","Alpha Team up north","Give me another shot at the Pros/Cons review.
Pros:
A movable heat ray is a nice touch.
TeeVee is back completly redesigned!
The walls open and close.
The Cannon on the front.
Scooters can detach from the main model
Cons:
There is only one skeleton drone. I would have two or at least give the guy a small vehicle.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Com161","2005-12-07T23:15:41Z","Brilliant! Just Brilliant!","I got this set after last Christmas for $20!!! Talk about a deal! Anyway, I need to get to my review. This set has lots of well-working devices, such as the levers that launch the sleds. And when Lego anounnced that these new Alpha Team sets could transform, I was in shock. This one can turn into an armored truck. Here is another one of my pros/cons reviews.

Pros:
Transformation
Two Ice Orbs
Ice box can trap an agent
Not too many stickers
Cool new Alpha Team Agents
Scooter-launchers work realy well

Cons:
Only one drone?

Overall:
Even though I paid $20 for it, $50 is still worth it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AMK152","2007-12-29T17:06:20.34Z","Best Alpha Team Set I own","This is the best Alpha Team set I own. I like the computers, they are awesome. Huge vehicle. I like how it folds down and that it includes a lot of minifigures. I've had this set for two years now and I still like it as much as I did when I first got it. Alpha Team fans, this is an ultimate set to get.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jet94","2008-07-29T16:20:12.67Z","Well worth buying","This is a great set with lots of detail and little pieces. I think you get a lot for your money and some good mini figures. I think the sleds are really good. Although i think that there could have been another bad guy, or a mini vehicle. But with a set thats this good to play with and to build it dosen't matter.

Pros
Lots of detail
Lots of little pieces.
Worth the money
Fun to build
Little sleds are awesome

Cons
Could have been more baddies

I give this set 10 out of 10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2008-11-28T14:00:07.81Z","GREAT SET!!  GET ONE!!","Please, please get this set.  It is SSOOOO detailed!!  First, I'll start with the minifigs.  All of them are unique, especially TV.  Boy, has TV changed from the old ones!  He looks like a gray C-3PO!  Anyway, this set comes with, uh, six minifigs I believe, counting the bad guy and TV.  Another cool thing is that the ice cube can hold a minifig in deep freeze!  The Command Center is very detailed, with the ice orb scanner and control panels everywhere.  There are a lot of guns on the Command Center, but the bad guy doesn't have one, so I gave him a silver spear. :D  Anyway, there is a launching cannon and deploying ice sleds.  There are some tools inside, and there's enough room to put a bunch of figures inside while the car is driving.  Here's the Pros and Cons.

Pros:

-Unique minifigs

-Launching cannon

-Deploying ice sleds

-Fast transformation

-Ice cube can hold a minifig

-Two ice orbs (I personally have a collection of ice orbs)

-Six minifigs

Cons:

-Only one bad guy

-Bad guy doesn't have a vehicle or weapon (just build him one)

ALTOGETHER, YOU NEED TO GET THIS SET.  SO GO GET IT TODAY.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EtudeTheBadger","2010-04-05T16:08:46.047Z","Alpha Team Antarctica","It's a race against time! Evil Ogel is planning to freeze time itself (not to mention the world), and only Alpha Team can stop him! <br><p>There. That's the dramatic intro outta the way, then. The Mobile Command Centre, an armored armadillo of a vehicle packed with gadgetry and gear, is Alpha Team's base for the Deep Freeze mission in the wastes of the Antarctic.&nbsp;</p><p>And it's one heckuva base. Seriously, this is the blueprint for any HQ on wheels, and it's not hard to see why. The build is a cool affair (pun intended), with a variety of frosty blues and whites. It'll take you a while to make the Mobile Command Centre, trust me (this was when LEGO gave you your money's worth), a superb purchase for Â£40. The detail is amazing; control panels and surveillance screens dominate the interior of the vehicle along with Alpha Team's walking computer and intel expert, Tee Vee. This android incarnation of him is excellent, a far cry from the almost comical television-on-legs and ROV seen in previous Alpha Team lines. Here to save the day are Agents Radia, Charge and Arrow, riding out the storm on supercharged snowmobiles (two are included for Charge and Arrow). The snowmobiles, as well as the deployment mechanism on the main vehicle, is inspired, and I've spent many hours launching them. The 'thermal missile' at the dorsal linkage between the cab and body is also a fun aspect of the vehicle. You can't go wrong with a spring-fire missile! The sides of the vehicle are also fun to lift and slide, as is the excellent crane.</p><p>There aren't really any poignant cons, really, apart from the typical Alpha Team colour scheme (the blues look a little washed out) and the inherent issues. Luckily, there's some brighter, more typical blue in there, so that's not so much of a problem.</p><p>One thing I find a little unusual is that the cab panel is yellow, Arrow's operational colour, yet Radia drives this thing. What is up with that, huh? Not a great concern? Moving on, then!</p><p>All in all, a brilliant set. It's got some great parts, some superb entertainment value, and it's a must for Alpha Team collectors.</p><p>-maaboo35<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
