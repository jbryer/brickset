"IndyLibrarian","2014-03-09T16:33:06.187Z","High playability and some nice vehicles","<p>I found this Police K9 unit to be a big improvement over the previous model <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7285-1/Police-Dog-Unit"">7285</a>. This set features a small building, a nice hot rod truck for the crooks, and a solid police SUV for the officer and his dogs.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions come in three parts - the hideout, the red truck, and the police SUV.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two criminals - one a suave jewel thief and the other I take to be hired muscle. The police officer has two dogs so you can really build up your German Shepard army.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I like the use of the brown chair pieces for the truck bed. The periscope in the hideout is a nice addition too. The police SUV is more solid than its predecessor, and more realistic looking too.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>An extra dog for your collection, plus a nicely designed police vehicle and an interesting civilian vehicle. Lots of playability.</p>

Much nicer looking that the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7285-1/Police-Dog-Unit"">7285 - Police Dog Unit</a>&nbsp;of 2011.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Normal LEGO&nbsp;City Box. On the backside there are several images of playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 3 booklets, one for the Crooks Hot Rod, one for the Crooks Hide Out and the third for the Police K-9 Dog Truck. The instructions are very simple and the building progress is very basic, about 3 pieces per built. Ideal for young builders.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>- 2 Crooks</p>

<p>- 1 Police officer</p>

<p>- 2 K-9 dogs</p>

<p>- 1 mouse</p>

<p>Several minifig tools such as a crowbar, money, a diamond, dog bones, cheese, golden cup and handcuffs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I said before, very simple building progress with about 2 to 3 pieces per built. For elder children the built is very simple but for new builders an ideal start.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><u>The Hot Rod</u></p>

<p>A very nice looking hot rod. The double wheel base at the back is fun and gives the truck something special. Looking to it from a rabbit&#39;s caught in the headlights view, the hot rod is just super badass. However, there are no headlights so the rabbit can hop away. It&#39;s a hot rod so it doesn&#39;t need any headlights.</p>

<p>The back loader is made of 4 brown chairs, a good find of the creator. After the build I can only spot one drawback and that is that the front axle is black, and the back axle is cream yellow. I would prefer white as older cars have often white wheel hubs.</p>

<p><u>The Crooks hideout</u></p>

<p>Nice looking hideout with a periscope.&nbsp;Perhaps&nbsp;just a little to small. It would have been better is it was 2 studs wider and longer. The small side doors to the supposed basement are rather small.</p>

<p><u>The K-9 Police Truck</u></p>

<p>One word: it&#39;s huge! Just as the hot rod, the truck is badass with a nice color scheme. An instant&nbsp;classic for me, however the back of the truck could have been better.</p>

<p>I think i&#39;m going to add a 1x1 holder piece to the roof dog unite of the Police Truck so the flashlight of the officer&nbsp;can be put away.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Superb set with a lot of playability. Love it!</p>
