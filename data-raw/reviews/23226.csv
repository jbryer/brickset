That being said let&rsquo;s move on to the numerous models and scenarios found inside the book.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Kai: This is your standard original version of Kai, with his oldest Gi, which is single-sided for the print and has minimal leg printing compared to future versions which have come since. He&rsquo;s a decent enough looking Minifigure though, and the scar on his face stands out as being fairly unique amongst LEGO Minifigures.</p>

<p>Frackjaw: The Skullkin look great and it&rsquo;s a shame that they haven&rsquo;t been seen since 2011 because I&rsquo;m a fan of this Minifigure design. The bodies are different from standard LEGO Skeletons as well, which makes them really stand out, and it&rsquo;s a nice printing as well with a great looking design.</p>

<p><strong>Models</strong></p>

<p>Sword of Fire: The first scenario for the LEGO Ninjago Brickmaster book involves a scene where Kai must protect the sword of fire from Frackjaw. This includes the following models:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Skull Cave: A small dungeon for the Skullkin, this model uses the parts to great effect, including a pair of skull topped flick-fire missiles to defend the dungeon against would-be rescuers. The parts used work well together, as can be expected from a mostly black, stone grey and white colour scheme.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Red Ninja Shrine: With the standard aesthetics of Ninjago shrines this little build is a fun looking model with some display options due to the hinge plates used on either side of the main shrine for the two weapons areas. A simple build with a lot of charm, this model stands out as something that can be added to any Ninjago sets as a set piece. The gold katana being used here however is nothing special and not the true Sword of Fire unfortunately, but it works well for what was used.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Doom Buggy: A Skullkin vehicle as a secondary model to attack the shrine, this little model isn&rsquo;t much. It does include a printed tile with the symbol of the Skullkin on it, and looks like a buggy should. It serves as a nice added play feature as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Catapult of Flames: A generic catapult build with very little to talk about. It isn&rsquo;t anything we haven&rsquo;t seen before from these types of models, but it does add more play value for younger builders.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-left: 18pt;"">Skeleton Mission: In our next exciting mini adventure Kai finds himself forced to protect another shrine from the evil Frakjaw and his terrifying Skeleton Tank. This scenario features three buildable models.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Skeleton Tank: A bulky looking vehicle model, this one includes the two flick-fire skeleton head missiles from the previous dungeon build sitting on the bulky looking off-road style vehicle. It has no real driving controls, Frakjaw just stands behind the missile launcher. It&rsquo;s an ok model, fun to play with and quick to build, not much else to say really.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Shrine of Weapons: The target of the evil Skullkin is this shrine, built tall and sturdy it houses all of Kai&rsquo;s weapons, from his black katana to a pair of spears, one silver the other brown, and an axe. Plus his trusty Sword of Fire, as the gold katana is referred to in this book. The shrine shares many of its elements from the previous model, in fact most of the upper portion is nearly identical in build. It does fit in quite nicely though and is a decent little model as part of the play scenario.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Spinning Fireballs: An odd name, but apt, this is a small catapult that spins around and can launch a burning fireball (made using a black cylinder and a fire piece) at Frakjaw. Kai uses this to defend the Shrine instead of the weapons housed there, for whatever reason. It&rsquo;s an ok companion piece for the model adding more play for the younger builders to enjoy.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-left: 18pt;"">Spinjitzu Shrine: Once again we have three models, many of which share very similar build techniques to past models. Now Kai is protecting a sacred Shrine of Spinjitzu and the Sword of Fire from Frakjaw in his Fire Rider vehicle. Can the Ninja protect his sacred golden weapon? And are the models decent enough? Read on and find out.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Fire Rider: This vehicle build is similar to the Doom Buggy and Skeleton Tank. It uses a fairly similar build to the previous model and is rather generic looking due to this. Not a bad model, but certainly not the best from this collection of builds. Still fun to play with though, and great design choice despite the flaws.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Rock Rack: This is literally a generic weapons rack mini-model. It uses fairly limited pieces, however it&rsquo;s a nice set piece for this adventure and offers more accessories for Frakjaw to fight Kai with.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Shrine of Spinjitzu: This shrine uses similar building techniques for the arch like structure where the Sword of Fire is kept. There is a long pathway leading up to the shrine with shrubbery and a spinning katana trap to prevent Frakjaw from making good his theft of the Sword of Fire. This model works well as something to tell the story with for fans of the Theme, however the very similar nature of the build for the arch is a bit unfortunate. It&rsquo;s not the worst mind you, however I&rsquo;d enjoy a bit more variety.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-left: 18pt;"">Ninja Attack:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Cart of Bones: There is very little different between the Cart of Bones and other vehicles in the rest of the scenarios from this title. It shares similar build techniques and many of the same parts as the Doom Buggy and Skull Tank. Frakjaw&rsquo;s vehicle does look fairly impressive though and certainly a threat for Kai.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Sacred Fireplace: A minor little model from this scenario, this is more of a set piece than anything too useful. The model looks nice for what it is, however the real fun from this particular scenario is the other two models.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Shrine of Sacred Fire: Another build of a shrine, this time using a fair number of pieces and incorporating the hinged plates for added play and display options. You also have the catapult to defend the shrine with and the weapons rack so that Kai can protect his Sword of Fire. The build technique for this shrine is slightly altered at this point, instead of incorporating the circular decoration in the top of the archway like many other builds, this time you use the pieces to make a different decoration inside the archway instead. A nice change of pace while still keeping the traditional appearance of the other shrines intact.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-left: 18pt;"">Battle for Ninjago:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Camouflage: This is a very minimalist model, it&rsquo;s basically two plates attached together and then two pieces of shrubbery, which is pretty much it. It&rsquo;s so Kai can hide to attack Frakjaw in his machine and retrieve the Sword of Fire&hellip; It doesn&rsquo;t work much.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Monster Machine: This model is one of the stand out ones from this Brickmaster grouping of models, it uses a fair number of parts to create a giant robot mech for Frakjaw and it looks great. The posing options are limited because it uses clips and precious little else for the arms while the legs have no motion at all, but it still works out quite well.<br />
	<br />
	Because it uses so many pieces it stands out as well, I do enjoy models that take full advantage of the parts included in these books as it means less clutter to put aside for the parts that aren&rsquo;t used.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>With so many options and models to choose from this is a great polybagged set with tons of parts and numerous ways to configure them for a play scenario for younger builders and fans of the Ninjago Theme. I have a few issues with what is included, namely that the golden Sword of Fire is just an ordinary Katana and there is a lot of sameness as you build through the book.</p>

<p>That being said, I would have to say this definitely stands out and I recommend getting the Brickmaster book to get this, as it is still in print this is the only way to get a Frakjaw or an original Kai Minifigure for a decent price, especially if you find it at Costco for half off. If you don&rsquo;t care much for Brickmaster products I&rsquo;d say it is safe to skip though.</p>
