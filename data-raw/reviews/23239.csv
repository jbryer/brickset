"Mineninja101","2015-04-09T22:59:16.44Z"," It's free! YAY! :) ","<p>I got this set free (with a purchase of $60 or more) at my local Lego store. This the newest of my three city sets two of which are ATVs</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>No box, it came in a bag. The instructions were the easiest thing to read in the world.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p class=""mainimg"">you could build this with parts from your own Lego collection</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One minifig, a policeman. Just a normal every day police man with handcuffs and a walkie talkie.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>easy. very easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The ATV looks much better than the ones you pay $6.99 or more for.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set you get for free.</p>
