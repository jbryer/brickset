The only reason to get this set would be to have one of those 'buckbeak' creatures...  Kind of a neat addition to a castle theme perhaps.  But overall, this set is quite lacking.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

This nice scene when Buckbeak the Hippogrif teach Draco respect is a nice set. The fig of Draco is way to common and this fleshy colour is no good. But Buckbeak is a great fig, maybe more than Fluffy and Aragog together. He is like a minifig horse with beautifull wings and a moving head ( He 'Can' bow ). great design.

The background:
The background is small but that is usual with this small sets. It has a tree with leaf pieces (very nice) and a great 3 leaves plant wich is not seen many times before in minifigs sets. Also a orange head wich is a Pumpkin. In the box are: A tile with a bondage on it, a tile with a spider and new dark grey feathers ( like the indians sets from 1997) And at last; A terriffic and terrifing book &quot;The Monsterbook of Monsters&quot;

You can say it has not much but it is a small set and you look at Vladeks encounter, wich has the same prize, it has maybe more (and special) pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set is small and pretty much unimportant. If you need a Buckbeak you should get this. You could also get 4753 (http://brickset.com/detail/?set=4753-1) for Buckbeak if you wanted.

WHAT IT COMES WITH
-1 Draco Malfoy, in proper Slytherin uniform
-1 Buckbeak
-1 beige Owl
-1 Tree-Shrub
-1 Pumpkin
-1 Monster Book of Monsters
-1 Weed

CONCLUSION/OVERVIEW
Get this for Buckbeak and/or Draco, or just get it to complete your Lego HP collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"CommanderOrbit27__film_girl_","2010-03-23T16:23:15.797Z","Awesome little set.","<p>:D Hello, and welcome to my review of <strong>LEGO Harry Potter: Draco's Encounter With Buckbeak! </strong></p>
<p>This is a small little set from 2004 (Prisoner of Azkaban). I got it for 20 euro, brand new and sealed in it's original box on Ebay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Minifigures!</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set contains one minifigure, Draco Malfoy, and a really nice figure of Buckbeak the hippogriff. Draco is a good version of the character. His face is a scowl, which&nbsp;is useful for minifig MOCs. </p>
<p>Buckbeak is the real attraction of the set, though. He is awesome. He&nbsp;is not unlike&nbsp;LEGO horse- his head moves up and down and he is the same size as a horse, too. Buckbeak also has two separate wing pieces, which are attached with clips so you can move them up and down.</p>
<p>My only gripe with this set figure-wise is that there were a lot more people in this scene in the movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Set!</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set has quite a nice selection of parts. Rare bits-n-bobs include printed spider tiles, a Monster Book of Monsters (the books that bite you) a printed bag, a tan owl, 2 feathers&nbsp;and a blank orange minifig head that is used as a pumpkin.</p>
<p>The actual built bit is ok. The tree is nice, and there is a secret door, which hides the precious rare pieces. :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PROS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draco Malfoy minifig</li>
<li>Buckbeak is brilliant</li>
<li>Rare pieces</li></ul>
<p>CONS:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could have had more minifigs</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, this is a wonderful set, and if you can find it, I highly recommend it. :D</p>

"LegoAdventures","2011-01-01T22:17:10.033Z","Draco's Encounter with Buckbeak","This is a superior set which was released in 2004 for the release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban </span>(<span style=""font-style: italic;"">For the scene which Malfoy intentionally provoked the Hippogriff Buckbeak</span>), and contains 36 pieces. It was the first set to begin the Lego Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban series. This set also was the first set to include numerous changes to Lego Harry Potter including: The new Blue Box design, The new Dark Grey Hogwarts School uniform as opposed to the original Hogwarts School uniform which was light Grey, The new Cape's which were fully black instead of the original design which was black on one side and Silver star's and swirls on the other side, And probably the biggest change was all the sets which included characters in licensed Movies or films like Harry Potter and Star Wars were given the proper Skin tone according to their character in that film. So inevitably there were certainly a lot of changes in the year 2004 not just for Lego Harry Potter and whether people like them or dislike them this set still remains a wonderful addition to the Lego Harry Potter series. I managed to get this set and basically all the other Prisoner of Azkaban sets on <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bricklink.com</span> (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Which is an excellent website for buying Lego if you didn't already know</span>). This particular set i bought for $55.00 AUD in a New Sealed Box in Excellent condition, and so i didn't surpass the opportunity at all, now let's get on to this fantastic set.<br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions: </h4><br>The Box is 14.1cm long, 14.1cm high and 4.6cm thick. The Box basically consists of the Red Lego insignia on the top left hand corner, the Illustration of Malfoy and Buckbeak and the entire set on the front, and the common things you normally see on a Lego box like Trademarks, Licensed agreements and future references and where the components are made, For this set the components were made in Denmark and the Czech Republic. The Box is also different to the Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sorcerer's Stone for the U.S</span>) and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secret Boxes which have the Hogwarts Castle's golden walls which decorate all around the outside of the box, Instead this set features all blue Hogwarts Castle Walls decorating around the entire back, sides and some of the front of the box. There is a computer generated illustration of all the Lego Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban sets on the back of this set which show this set in colour and all the other sets in a Trans-clear colour. There is also a different angle of the set and an alternative model of the set which was available on LEGO.com however i don't think the link is there anymore, however it doesn't look very hard to build. Inside the Box there is 2 Clear plastic bags containing most of the elements included in this set excluding 2 pieces which are not in sealed bags and that is Buckbeak (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Which is fully assembled apart from his wings which you connect to his body</span>) and the small green base plate. And last but not least the Instruction manual which is 20 pages long including the back page and the Illustrations at the back of the instructions, but is 14 pages of actual building steps. <br><br><h4>Mini-figure/Buckbeak/Set/Overall:</h4><br>The set includes 1 Mini-figure which Draco Malfoy. He has Dark Grey pants, Dark Grey Hogwarts School sweater with white collar, Silver and Green tie and Silver and Green stitching at the bottom of the sweater and black lines around his waist (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Either to give him the look that he doesn't tuck his shirt in or he is untidy or so active and mischievous that his uniform is never neat</span>) His character is basically identical to his original Character from Philosopher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets however his Skin tone has been changed and his eyebrows are a lighter colour, however this can alter from Mini-figure to Mini-figure. You also receive Buckbeak (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Hippogriff</span>) which is a complete custom piece and looks incredible. His features include Bird like feet, Horse back and legs and feathers all up his neck and side which are described in the book (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span>) Buckbeak is a sort of Blue-Grey or light Grey colour and his wings are Charcoal Grey. The actual set itself is enthralled with Simplicity however this keeps the set neat and easy and besides it is the first set and the first sets of basically all themes are small. You have a Green base plate with a brown tree and branches which has 3 Emerald green leaf like Lego pieces and a Cream Owl. There is a Green plant with 3 large leaves that lies in between the 2 roots of the tree and beside that is an Orange Pumpkin (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Orange Mini-fig Head</span>) Behind the Pumpkin is some sort of Rock formation or seat and when opened reveals a small compartment that contains: A Grey package with Brownish-Gold lacing on a Cream background, One of Buckbeak's feathers (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">A Grey Quill Ink piece</span>), a Black spider with a white head and abdomen on a small green Lego piece. This set also includes the Cream book which is called The Monster Book of Monsters. &nbsp; <br><br>I'm sorry if this review was a bit to long, however i wanted it to be a Quality review rather than a quick review that didn't have much information. <br>So Overall i strongly recommend this set with full confidence that you will enjoy it, it is a wonderful Magical Harry Potter set that will be remembered for many years to come. 5/5 <br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review. :)",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
