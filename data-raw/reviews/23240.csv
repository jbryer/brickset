The set is mostly a few very basic pieces repeated and there are a lot of fiddly little 1x1 tiles and such that can be a bit of a pain (or perhaps I just have fat fingers).</p>

<p>I believe there is another version of this set coming out in the future that will incorporate the coloured roofs of the actual building. I could be wrong but I hope this is true as that would add some interest in my opinion.</p>

<p>There is a single minifig&nbsp;included here that is not particularly exciting and seems quite unrelated to the rest of the set. Perhaps just added as an afterthought or to grab the eye of those looking to achieve the minifig&nbsp;singularity :)</p>

<p>If you are collecting special edition sets or the architecture line (though as pointed out in another review, this is not technically part of it) then this is a nice addition but if you just want a fun build I&#39;d recommend&nbsp;going for something else.</p>

<p>As always, I did a <a href=""https://youtu.be/n5hfMNS0OMw"">stop frame version of my build</a> which you can watch on my channel.
