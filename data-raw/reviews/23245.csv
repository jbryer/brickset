This colorful little set gives me hope.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Nothing like throwing a toddler in a warm tub with some fun toys, and this one works well. The bright pastel colors are soothing and delightful to the eye. The two large flower heads are a wonderful addition along with the cute printed bricks. And the little rabbit and cub look at home in both boats. At least we have the option of tossing in some zoo animals to simulate an ark.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>While the part count of 18 pieces is low, the larger boat &nbsp;(in blue and maybe azure) mounted on the top of the box is about 8 by 12 studs on deck and 4 studs in height and is big enough for holding several other pieces and decent play options.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>LEGO is going the right direction with adorable Duplos like Boat Fun! I prefer this generic design of boat over the Duplo Pirate series because it allows for more imaginative play options, is less oriented towards boys, and more peaceful without the swords, cannons, etc. While the Duplo Pirate theme is very well executed, I tend to avoid police, fire, castle and other more violent themes for toddlers. They will face enough trauma/violence too soon IMHO. And they can always use their fingers as pretend weapons while playing with generic LEGO.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Did I mention that this set is a present for me? Yup, it is fine to buy Duplo for an adult. Guess I'll need to improve my preschool skill of sharing with guests of all ages who eye my toys!</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
