"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-25T11:30:22.03Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Harry and the Marauder's Map Review","This set is part of the 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' episode when Harry got the marauder's map from Fred and George Weasley. Actually this set wasn't part of the movie but it was in the book. The corridor underneath the trap-door is very small and you can't set up a minifig very well.<br><br>This set comes with Harry Potter with the flesh skin which LEGO started to make for licensed themes back in 2004. His face is still noting special but the torso has no badge when the Harry Potter sets for the 3rd movie came out. Professor Snape has brighter markings on his torso and on his legs but he's also not very special.<br><br>The statue is a minifig - except LEGO did a dark gray head for the statue which is exclusive in this set. Also exclusive is the map. I don't really know if this map is included in other sets now but this piece was exclusive when this model was released. I really like the minifigs of this set and I enjoyed building it. The play feature is good as well.<br><br>This set also comes with one idea which you can build with the pieces of this set. The idea can be found at the end of the instruction or on the back of the box.<br><br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

It comes with Harry and his cloak, Snape, and the Marauder's Map, of course. You can also push a wand into a hole to make the one-eyed witch move back (Dissendium!). It also comes with a rare orange spider and some plants. It is a must-have set.&nbsp; <br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
