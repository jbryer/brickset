"Jon_Brick","2014-03-01T02:11:02.57Z","When Hydra Attacks!","<p>After not too long of a wait (under three years since the start of the Super Heroes theme) &nbsp;lego has released a set centered around the Red Skull, one of Captain America&#39;s oldest and fiercest enemies. It is a welcome surprise to get Red Skull so soon since, even though he has been an enemy to the Avengers as a whole, he has always focused his villainous efforts around Captain America. So do the Red Skull and his Hydra soldier make a worthy debut or is this a red headed exemption to the mostly well made Super Heroes sets?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the standard size for a set this price ($24.99 CAD) displaying the small number of play features in the set. And the instructions are likewise pretty standard, and thankfully all in one booklet unlike some similar-sized sets recently.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The most notable pieces are those belonging to Captain America&#39;s motorcycle which is composed of the standard motorcycle chassis and a dark red standard motorcycle&nbsp;top.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/12843540183_8a5e58fc94.jpg"" style=""height:375px; width:500px"" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hydra tank (or APC if you want to get more technical) has some nice olive green slopes to give it a slick military look to suit the Red Skull, which is surprising given the Lego Group&#39;s stance on things depicting modern military, but more on that later. The two other pieces of note are the top and bottom parts of the&nbsp;4x4&nbsp;turntable which is what allows the tank turret to rotate 360&deg; an ability that is probably one of the highlights to the set.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family:arvo-fs,rockwell,courier,sans-serif; font-size:20px; letter-spacing:-0.75px"">Minifigures</span></p>

<p>Of course when it comes to minifigures in a $24.99 CAD (or $19.99 USD / &pound;19.99 UK) super heroes set we get the standard trio of figures a rule which has apparently been set in stone since the start of the theme, (seriously every set of that price has had exactly 3 standard minifigures). This time the trio consists of Captain America (duh) Red Skull and a Hydra Henchman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;?<img alt=""Cap'n Goody-goody, Sunburn and Jaundice-man"" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7306/12843845634_77973fec80.jpg"" style=""height:375px; width:500px"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get the titular Captain America sporting a brighter blue and red suit (with a few small changes) and a more lighthearted expression than his&nbsp;<em>Avengers</em>&nbsp;movie version. Compared to his movie version Cap&#39; also has more detailed muscle printing, a brown belt with pouches (instead of dark blue) and some grey highlights under his armpits on the front and back which has printing similar to that on the front.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3710/12843418125_3e1fc025a5.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;?<img alt="""" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2888/12843858424_547e19610e.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next we have the Red Skull and as I briefly hinted before it&#39;s a bit surprising that lego&nbsp;brought such a dark and militaristic villain into minifigure form. Don&#39;t get me wrong I&#39;m glad we have the Red Skull as a figure but given that he&#39;s a blatant metaphor for the Nazi&#39;s it&#39;s just a bit strange that they would even consider him, but&nbsp;I&#39;m not going to go any further into the subject. The Red Skull minifigure is very well done with an enraged grimace on his face and a black military coat and brown belt with a big Hydra buckle and a bit of light brown undershirt sticking out at his collar. On his back is a continuation of the belt and a few creases for detail. Oddly enough Red skull resembles the Marvel Cinematic Universe&nbsp;version more than the <em>Avengers Assemble</em>&nbsp;version, the latter of which he is based on.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ??<img alt="""" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2843/12843512243_6fd0306173.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hydra henchman is a welcome addition to the Marvel Super Heroes theme which so far has been lacking in terms of hired goons. Like the Red Skull the Hydra Henchman has an enraged look on his face, &nbsp;yellow goggles and harness/belt combo with one little pocket and a belt buckle with a big &quot;H&quot; on his belt (presumably for Hydra but perhaps he&#39;s a Habs fan) to go with his green uniform, along with some muscle detailing.&nbsp;On the back we have the rest of the belt/harness with three more pockets and for some reason a big yellow &quot;H&quot; on the back of his head (Hydra must really be into branding).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There isn&#39;t much to Captain America&#39;s motorcycle since it&#39;s only eight pieces but it&#39;s a nice bike with a good colour scheme to go with the Captain.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ????<img alt="""" src=""http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3820/12843540183_8a5e58fc94.jpg"" style=""height:375px; width:500px"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ????<img alt="""" src=""http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7375/12843885834_21de1e48c6.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hydra tank/APC is pretty well made but feels a bit lackluster, though this may be due to my age since I feel like someone much younger would thoroughly&nbsp;enjoy the &quot;suspension&quot; function which is really just two wheels balanced in a see-saw type fashion which you may be able to see below (though maybe not due to my less than perfect photography skills).</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ?????<img alt="""" src=""http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2809/12843823404_26c8325c67.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The tank/APC&nbsp;is also strangely flat with the wheels feeling tacked on and the olive sloped pieces make the vehicle look like one of those weird amphibian type vehicles (which is probably intentional though the set description says nothing about it). The turret, with 360 degree rotation ability, definitely saves the tank/APC&nbsp;from being just another deconstructed vehicle used for parts.&nbsp;Even with the seemingly inescapable flick-fires bolted onto the sides of the turret and the tank/APC not being that great on a whole (I&#39;d give it a 3 out of 5) I have to say it&#39;s nice to finally get a large ground vehicle for the bad guys since they&#39;ve been largely limited to medium-small sized aircraft and small ground vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a nice set with a good trio of complimentary minifigures, and while I wouldn&#39;t necessarily display it above other sets, it&#39;s nice to have around (and the suspension is starting to win me over) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this is a average set, not great like 76004 Spider-cycle Chase but not completely random like 76006 Extremis&nbsp;Sea Port Battle. If you don&#39;t really like the theme and don&#39;t care for the figures or the look of the set then I would save yourself some time and skip it that being said I would definitely pick this up if you&#39;re a fan of the characters or the theme in general since it&#39;s always nice to add a few villains to the collection cause you don&#39;t want to make it too easy for the heroes.</p>

"robb","2015-02-10T21:47:01.13Z","Enjoyed by my young boys","<p>My son (5yo)&nbsp;received this set as a birthday present. He has been an avid LEGO/DUPLO builder since he was a baby and built this set on his own.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>My son enjoys the short comics that are included in the LEGO super hero sets. He is not enough to watch any of the PG-13 Marvel or DC movies, and he only has limited exposure to super hero cartoons. He gets most of his knowledge of super heroes from LEGO video games, comics, and other storybooks that he borrows from the library, so he treasures the little LEGO comic books as much as the bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The olive bricks are a nice addition as well as the wheels. When buying a set for a 5 year old boy, a vehicle is very important, so this set does not disappoint.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Captain America is the really reason to get this set. Since he has only appeared in a limited number of sets, this was the first time our family was able to add the&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Cap to our collection. He is great, if a bit&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">cartoony</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;(versus the Marvel Cinematic version that is being released in 2015). Still we love him and his bike.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">My son also enjoys Red Skull and the Hydra agent. Two bad guys are no match for the Cap though.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I was not involved in the build, but it must not have been too difficult since my son was able to complete it on his own. It does have several stickers, but if 5 year old can apply them straight, then no adult should have any problems.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">I get a bit tired of these models that have shooting&nbsp;</span>torpedos<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">, but the boys get a mild kick out of them. More interesting to them, though, is the fact&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">that the top of the tank can rotate, and that the wheels rise and fall as the tank drives over Cap&#39;s bike.</span></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is not as flashy as some of the other Superhero sets (One of the best being the DC&nbsp;Lex Luther Mecha set), but it has high playability for children and is not nearly as complicated a build given the functionality of the completed model. I recommend it for children or for those who just have to have Red Skull or a Hydra agent as part of their collection.&nbsp;</p>

"gne_builders","2020-11-28T20:06:14.147Z","Great set one problem.","<p>I love this set! The wheels are very clever, they roll over obstacles easily and comically. Also the turret with flick fire missiles is good for playability, but the antenna piece on top is rather long and I think a fencing sword like the one on top of the dwarf spider droid in set 75142 would be more appropriate. I like that the motorcycle can hold Cap&#39;s shield which make the playability factor much better. I like this Cap&#39;s printing compared to the other printings of him that I own. Overall this is a great set. Red skull looks awesome and the hydra henchman is hilarious.&nbsp;</p>

"KarateKid84","2020-10-22T14:04:55.29Z","Fantastic Set","<p>Hey guys!&nbsp; KarateKid84 here, and I am going to review set 76017: Avengers: Captain America vs. Hydra.&nbsp; First up lets discuss the mini figures.&nbsp; Captain America is exclusive to this set, and is a really cool mini figure.&nbsp; I love this mini figure.&nbsp; He&#39;s in his Classic Version Suit from LEGO Marvel&#39;s Avenger&#39;s video game which is really nice.&nbsp; His outfit is blue which is generic to Captain America figures but at least it&#39;s a different shade.&nbsp; Next up is the HYDRA Henchman, who is also exclusive to this set.&nbsp; I am not really a fan of this mini figure.&nbsp; He&#39;s really generic and definitely not the highlight of this set.&nbsp; Finally, we have the infamous Red Skull who is also exclusive to this set, so 3 exclusive mini figures.&nbsp; I also love this mini figure.&nbsp; Red Skull is Cap&#39;s arch nemesis and is represented pretty well in this set.&nbsp; He&#39;s got his dark brown belt on which is nice too.&nbsp; The main part of this set is the 8 wheeled vehicle which belong to the Red Skull.&nbsp; Very nice build.&nbsp; It has missiles which fire when you push the back.&nbsp; The cockpit I guess you could call it swivels so the HYDRA Henchman can fire in multiple directions.&nbsp; I really like that feature.&nbsp; You can definitely add Captain America too your LEGO Avenger&#39;s mini figure collection.&nbsp; He looks really nice next to all the other ones.&nbsp; The set is cartoonish, but I still like it.&nbsp; It sort of represents Captain America: The First Avenger which is cool.&nbsp; It has a WWII vibe to it.&nbsp; You can also add HYDRA Henchman and Red Skull to your HYDRA minifigure collection as well.&nbsp; This set comes with an infinity stone which is cool, but it isn&#39;t in stone form.&nbsp; It is in the form of the Tesseract.&nbsp; Cap&#39;s motorcycle is really nice too.&nbsp; It&#39;s a pretty generic LEGO motorcycle, but it does have a place to rest the shield on the back.&nbsp; If you are looking for the space stone in its stone form, buy the Endgame or Infinity War sets, but this one does a good job of representing the space stone in its Pre-Thanos form.&nbsp; Overall, this is a pretty good set.&nbsp; The highlight for me definitely is the set is the tank and motorcycle.&nbsp; I got this set for $20, but you can probobly find it online at about $30, so not that big of a difference.So, if you love the Avengers Assemble TV series on Disney XD, this set is a must-have for you or if you love the minifigures.&nbsp; Happy Building!!</p>

"Thompsonwithap","2021-12-18T03:40:24.51Z","Majestic set","<p>Wonderful set, mini figures are great and unique, the set has quite a few action features that younger children will like.</p>

<p>Pros.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The printing for the figures were great, especially for red skull, you can even see the hydra insignia on his belt buckle.</p>

<p>The stickers have been printed really well and really enhance the set.</p>

<p>The AFV red skull drives&nbsp;features olive green bricks instead of&nbsp;the generic dark green coloured bricks.</p>

<p>The teeter totter effect for the wheels will bring a smile&nbsp;to the faces of&nbsp;younger children.</p>

<p>The AFV is very militaristic and looks like a vehicle hydra would use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>The inside&nbsp;of the AFV I think needs a little more detail like an equipment or weapon rack.</p>

<p>The hydra hench&nbsp;man lacks a weapon.</p>

<p>Overall great set with nice and unique mini figs and a nice vehicle for the villains, the designer deserves a raise.</p>
