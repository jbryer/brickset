<p>My box ended up cut open and recycled, the instructions were very clear and had no discoloration problems, and I noticed nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t think there was anything unique, but the yellow trim (antennae, guardrails, yellow and black striped &quot;warning&quot; pieces), blue, grey and black pieces were all well represented. You get the same size (I think) rounded transparent wall pieces as Arkham or the last Hulk/Avengers set, so for MOCers&nbsp;out there, you can make a full cylinder, like in the Avengers movie. There is also a clear door, which I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen to many of in modern sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is where the set earned it&#39;s price to me.<br />
<br />
First up is the Falcon. I&#39;m glad they included him in some kind of set this year, as he will be featured in the new Captain America movie, which Lego hasn&#39;t made sets for. A two sided face (neutral and smirking) and torso, and &#39;light brown&quot; hands, which don&#39;t match the face, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen any other Lego pieces in the same shade. Weird. He also has a &quot;new as far as I know&quot; set of wings, in translucent red.</p>

<p>Taskmaster is a neat inclusion, and this variation (I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not familiar with the Avengers Assemble source material) looks interesting. A double sided torso with a sword holder printed on, white cape and white mask are all nice, as well as the white &quot;underpants&quot; to highlight the ensemble. His head has a serious/smirking double print, and his accessories, aside from the cape, are the LOTR longsword and Boromir&#39;s shield with an orange brick on it.</p>

<p>Thor is neat. He has no stubble (and a &quot;scared&quot; look with his neutral/puzzled face), unlike his Chris Hemsworth based counter parts, but has the same hair piece, Mjolnir, cape, and a similar (although distinct) chest piece. He also has a gold belt painted on to his torso as well.</p>

<p>MODOK seemed, aside from his enormous head, very plain. He has purple pants and a gold torso with purple arms/hands, all unprinted. The pants are hardly seen when he is seated in his flying chair (an interesting built-up accessory), and his torso is covered by part of his head piece. His giant, teeth gritting head is pretty accurate to how I remember the villain, so despite much &quot;flair&quot;, he is a solid mini figure.</p>

<p>HULK SMASH! That&#39;s obligatory, isn&#39;t it? An almost identical figure to the Helicarrier Breakout set last year, but with purple pants (!) and a closed set of gritted teeth. Nothing super new, but I&#39;ll say it: They don&#39;t have enough Hulks, probably because he takes over the set he&#39;s in.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Something seemed...familiar. Hulk, in a lab, with a Norse god in captivity...<br />
<br />
Anyway, the build itself is quite interesting, and actually had a few surprises I found by building that I didn&#39;t know it had from it&#39;s still photos. If I had read the box, I may not have missed anything, I suppose, but I was excited to get building.</p>

<p>The lab is built up as two &quot;towers&quot; with a &quot;bridge&quot; that is filled in, to be smashed out, a battle damage gun tower for MODOK, Thor&#39;s holding cell and stairs to it, and even a little security robot. Being brick built, they didn&#39;t consider it a mini figure, but it has a face, sort of (the grill and body piece make it look like it has eyes and a mouth), and is an equivalent of the Droidekas from the Star Wars sets.<br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious &quot;smash wall&quot; under the &quot;bridge&quot;, the play set has a ledge that breaks away with the help of technic pieces, and the bridge/holding cell break away pretty cleanly as well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s deeper and more solid then I suspected it would be, and looks pretty good all pieced together.<br />
<br />
Full disclosure, this AFOL&nbsp;smashed the wall out with the Hulk figure <strong><em>many </em></strong>more times then was needed. This set is made more for play then to display.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve hinted at it in the article, it was a very familiar kind of set to last year&#39;s&nbsp;Hulk-centeric&nbsp;Lego set. To me it doesn&#39;t take much away from the set, but I hope this isn&#39;t the only way we see the Hulk, in a slightly overpriced lab,and Loki/Thor in a containment cell, in the same price range, that collectors have to buy to get a clear fan favorite. At least they didn&#39;t give the Hulk his own tank to drive, or a beach house, or a jet-ski or something.</p>

<p>That being said, if I was someone looking to play or build, this is a great set. There are a lot of play functions, some useful, but not overly rare, pieces, and you do get some sweet mini figures, all of which are either unique, or are unique variations.</p>

<p>I liked the mini-jet from the other set, but there are enough play options with this set to make you forget about it, and the laser turret and security bot do a great job covering for it.</p>

<p>My verdict? It says 4, but I would give it a 4.5 if I could. My only gripe is it&#39;s very similar to last years Hulk set, but it&#39;s, in my opinion, a better build, more to do, and better minifigures.</p>

"DrOrrery","2014-04-21T14:15:04.73Z","Superb Playability","<p>I mainly bought this for the minifigures, thinking the set itself would be largely the same as Hulk&#39;s Helicarrier&nbsp;(6868) set from 2012. &nbsp;However, I was delighted to find one of the best thought out and playable sets I&#39;ve seen for years.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Arvo-FS, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Minifigures</span></p>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;were my initial reason for buying the set, and they are very good. &nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">MODOK obviously stands out with the giant minifig style head and it&#39;s very well done. &nbsp;His seat is an integral part of his costume and it&#39;s also done well. &nbsp;</span>Falcon comes out very well and looks a lot like the cartoon series. &nbsp;Thor is much closer to the cartoon series than the movies, the stubble is gone and his outfit in traditional four colour comic style. &nbsp;Hulk is the same model as Hulk&#39;s Helicarrier with purple pants and a slightly different face. And finally Task Master is a good choice of villain, with cape, cowl, sword and shield. &nbsp;The AIM robot is simple and adds something else to move around.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><span style=""font-family: Arvo-FS, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Parts</span></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">There&#39;s nothing particularly interesting about the parts, some nice transparent curves and a glass door, that&#39;s about as far as it goes here.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple but very well thought out, which we&#39;ll come to in a moment. &nbsp;There&#39;s nothing that&#39;s particularly difficult to build, although the way the pieces slot together is very clever. &nbsp;The back wall is made of 3 separate chunks that slot together to appear completely solid. &nbsp;The large laser is made of two chunks that slot together, and MODOK&#39;s feet attach so that he can &quot;drive&quot; the laser. &nbsp;The stairs are another chunk, and the curved glass cell rests on the top of them. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model/Playability</h3>

<p>Once completed, the model looks completely solid. &nbsp;It&#39;s not at all fragile, it can be picked up and moved around easily. &nbsp;However, there&#39;s some great playability hidden there, and it&#39;s spelled out beautifully in the accompanying comic, which is basically instructions for how to play with it. &nbsp;Taking Hulk, you can bust open the back wall and it flies off in 3 pieces. &nbsp;Pressing a lever under the laser (or having Hulk &#39;smash&#39; it) flips it apart, flying into two pieces, one of which will have MODOK attached to it. &nbsp;You can then push a strut out under a gantry, which will tip the robot off, before finally hitting another lever next to the stairs. &nbsp;This causes the stairs to fly off together with the curved glass walls of the cell, releasing Thor. &nbsp;It works beautifully and best of all it takes about 30 seconds to put it all back together, ready to do again. &nbsp;Which my kids did over and over and over again. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As you can tell by the score, I&#39;m incredibly impressed by this set. &nbsp;The idea of destruction of the model being a major part of play has been done before, but often causes the models to be difficult to handle. &nbsp;Yet half of this set has been created specifically to be destroyed and it is completely solid. &nbsp;It&#39;s also amazingly fun to play with, it&#39;s not a very large set and yet has more going on than a lot of sets twice its size. &nbsp;Like a lot of licensed sets, you&#39;re paying a lot for the minifigs and there&#39;s not a huge amount of Lego, which would lead me to consider it poor value for money if it wasn&#39;t that they&#39;ve done so much with what they&#39;ve got. &nbsp;This is one of my favourite sets for a long time and I highly recommend it.</p>
