dont be fooled by how open it is, because it does have some cool pieces, such as a spiral staircase, arched window, 6 dark grey 2*1*5 bricks, and 3 skulls and 2 horse heads. The minifigs are good and rare ones too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-02T14:35:33Z","Neville Longbottom at last!","The figs are great! Neville Longbottom (Shall we ever see the weasley twins?), Remus Lupin (a.k.a. Moony) and a Boggart with the face of Snape and the Dress of the Grandmother of Neville. Neville has a strange smile on his face like he doesn't know if he must fear or laugh, but it is a nice face (only fleshcoloured), The hair of Remus is the hair of Lockhart in the new Brown colour. His face is nice (but Fleshcoloured) but have strange scars on it. his suit is nice. the dress of the Boggart is good. This set has the new 1*2 tile with a chocolate bar on it and a piece out of it.
Oh, yeah, The building is also nice, It could have more figs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's 3 minifigures - Lupin, Neville and the Boggart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All for recreating a scene from the Prisoner of Azekban movie/book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all it is a fun little set to have, either for play or display.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"LegoAdventures","2011-01-25T06:30:59.113Z","Professor Lupin's Classroom ","This is a Fantastic set!. It is honestly a Stupendous remake of the Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hogwarts</span>, And personally I think Lego did this set Justice because it looks Fantastic. One of the things I really like about this set is there is simple elements that give a huge realistic impact to the set, like the 2 Half Curved Brown Roof Arch pieces which resemble the real Roof Arches in the Classroom in the Movie, even though they are simple elements they give the set a more realistic Vibe and I think it's Superb. <br>Released in 2004 to Coincide with the Blockbuster release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span>, it contains 155 Pieces, 3 Mini-figures and the Defense Against the Dark Arts Classroom. I managed to get this set in a New Sealed Box in Excellent Condition from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bricklink.com</span> for $50 AUD, and I can strongly say do not surpass the opportunity to get this Marvellous set!. <br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions:</h4><br>The Box is 28.5cm Long, 19cm Tall and 5.8cm Thick. It consists of the usual features and offerings that you find on a Lego Box, like the Front Illustration and Red Lego Insignia. Around the sides, back and part of the Front of the Box is covered in the colour Blue, a feature on all of the Prisoner of Azkaban sets. There is an Illustration of all the Prisoner of Azkaban sets (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apart from the Exclusive 10132 Motorized Hogwarts Express</span>) and they are all Trans-White and see through, however <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Professor Lupin's Classroom</span> isn't see through it is in Colour. This is also a feature which is on all of the Prisoner of Azkaban sets. There is also an Alternative Model of the set which you can Download from LEGO.com, however I don't think the Link is there anymore. There is also numerous angles of the set and Mini-figs. There is also the usual Future References, Trademarks, Copyrights, Licensed Agreements and where the Components are made, For this particular set the Components are made in Denmark and Korea. (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm guessing the pieces are made in Denmark and the Box or packaging are made in Korea</span>) After all that's what i love about Lego is that's it's Quality European Manufactured. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Inside the Box there is 3 Plastic Bags not numbered so the Building Experience may be a bit more difficult or longer considering you have to find the pieces throughout various bags. There is also a 8x16 Dark Grey Base plate and 8x8 Dark Grey Base plate, these are not in Plastic Bags. There is also a Sticker :( of the Boggart Concealed Cupboard, however at least it is just one. I also received a small 2003 Lego Catalog and last but not least the 26 Page Instruction Booklet, 32 for the Illustrations at the back. <br><br><h4>Mini-figs:</h4><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor Remus John Lupin</span> also Known as <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Moony</span> or <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor R.J Lupin:</span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>Professor Lupin features his Wavy-Styled Dark Orange Hair (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Identical to Gilderoy Lockharts Hair piece</span>). He features Sparkling Innocently Calm eyes, slightly raised Black eyebrows, a lovely Quirky sort of smile and curled Grey Moustache with 2long diagonal Salmon-Flesh claw scratches along his face. His Torso features a Dark Olive Green Suit and a light Mint Green work T-Shirt with a Jet Black Tie that seems to have a very small tear. Going down <br>his Suit he has 2 Silver buttons with 2 Black holes in each. His Suit also features 2 Pockets and 3 tears around the Chest and bottom of the Suit. He has Dark Olive Pants and a Beautiful Light Stone Grey Cape resembling his Robes.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Neville Longbottom:</span> Neville Features Combed Black Hair, Sparkling Black eyes that look slightly squinted because of his happy smiling Expression. He features slightly thick curved Eyebrows with a slightly shy yet happy opened Mouth that features 2 little white Front Teeth and a small Black line near his Smile resembling his expressions. His Torso features&nbsp; the new Dark Grey Hogwarts Uniform and sweater, with Gold and Crimson Red Tie, White Collar and stitching around the Neck and bottom of the sweater. There is also a Gold and Crimson Red lace around the bottom of the sweater and various black lines, showing he is so active and adventurous that he's uniform is always messy and not neat. <br>And last but not least he also features his Dark Grey pants and Black Cape resembling his Robes.<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Boggart </span>Mimicking <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor Severus Snape</span> in Neville's Grandmothers Clothes:</span> Snape features Greasy Oily long Jet Black Hair. He also features a Glow in the Dark Head that has suspiciously raised Black eyebrows, An eye that seems to be Twitching or giving someone the evil sly death look and the other eye slightly more opened than the other eye, though still looking evil and curious. He also features a very strange puzzled type <br>of angry mouth. His Torso features Sand Green Grandmothers Clothing with a Black Outline of the Clothing near the bottom, which has 2 Decorated pockets. There is also 3 Olive Green type patterns near the bottom of the Torso and 1 Beige Button. There is the front of a Beige Cat which seems to be attached by some sort of Scarf, and the Cat has a Brown Mouse in its Mouth. And last of all he features Sand Green Pants.<br><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">I will be writing the review of the Classroom in 2 sections, The Office and Classroom to make it a bit easier to understand.</span><br style=""font-style: italic;""><br><h4>Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom Office:</h4><br>You start off with a 8x8 Dark Grey Base plate. On either side of the 8x8 Dark Grey Base plate you place 2 White Attachments, which you connect a Grey Spider Web with an Orange Spider that's placed in the middle of the Web. You then place 1 Dark Grey Triangular piece on the Right of one of the White Attachments, then you place a Black Hinge on the Left of one of the White Attachments <span style=""font-style: italic;"">which you eventually attach to the Classroom</span>. You then place a Dark Grey Triangular piece on the other side of the Base plate, 4 Studs in front of the Black Hinge. You then place 3 Dark Grey Pylons, 1 on the Dark Grey Triangular piece, 1 on Half of the Black Hinge and 1 on the other Dark Grey Triangular piece. You then place 8 Beige Staircase pieces in the Forth corner of the 8x8 Dark Grey Base plate which you swivel around to make a realistic Staircase for the Teacher to reach the Office floor. Now that there is 4 Structures on all corners you can place a 8x8 Black piece for the Floor in the Office. Above the Beige Staircase and 1 of the Dark Grey Pylons you place 2 Dark Grey Triangular pieces on the Black Floor for the Office. Behind the Dark Grey Triangular piece on the Left you place 2 L shaped Light Grey pieces which resemble a small compartment. You then place a 2x2 Dark Grey piece in another corner of the Office and a Black Hinge above the Black Hinge that's on the bottom floor. You then place a Small White Tile that has an opened Blue Book with Gold Writing and Gold Stars coming out of it in the 2 L shaped Light Grey compartment which you place a Tilting Hinge mechanism and a small Brown Piece which resembles a small Desk over the top of the 2 L shaped pieces. Now you have a small Desk that you can open up to reveal the small Book inside. On top of the 2x2 Dark Grey piece and Black Hinge you place a 2x8 Brown piece that resembles a large Table. You place a Turn table in the middle of the Table and 2 more Light Grey L shaped pieces on either side of that. On top of the Turn Table is a Classic <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Gramophone</span> player. The Gramophone consists of 1 Beige Cylindrical Piece that has a Black Mini-fig Speaker Phone/Old<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Star Wars</span> Gun piece on top and on the front of the Speaker/Gun piece is a Yellow Inverted Dish Piece. On the Turn Table under the Gramophone there is a Trans Blue Tile that has Gold Stars on it. On the right of the Gramophone is a Brown Suitcase most likely Professor Lupins and on the left side of the Gramophone is a Red Book that has numerous Herbology Plants in it. On the small Brown Table above the little compartment that hides the book there is a Trans Clear Cylindrical piece that has a Trans Neon Green stud on top resembling some sort of Jar or Potion. Next to that is a Skeleton Skull Mini-fig Head. You then finish his Office with numerous Sloped pieces, a small Square roof and 4 Green Sloped pieces on top of the Square roof. You also place 2 Trans Orange Flame Pieces on either side of the Office's Entrance, that are attached to 2 Grey Triangular pieces that have attachments on them. <br><br><h4>Defence Against the Dark Arts Classroom: </h4><br>You start of with a Dark Grey 8x16 Base plate. Which you attach the Black Hinge from the Office to the Classroom floor. You then place 2 2x2 Brown Pieces that have a 2x6 Brown piece on top resembling a Table. On top of the Table you place a 1x2 Tile slightly unwrapped Chocolate bar piece that has 1 bight in it and the pretty wrapping is pulled back. On the right of that you place a Skeleton Skull Mini-fig Head with a Trans-Neon Yellowish Green Dome over the top. On the left of the Chocolate Bar you place 1 Trans Red Cylindrical piece that has a Trans-Neon Yellowish Green Stud on top. And next to that you place a Trans Quantum Purple Square with a Trans Clear stud on top, both resembling some sort of Potion or Jar. Next to that you place a Dark Grey Pylon, and 6 Studs to the side of that Pylon you place a Thinner Dark Grey Pylon. You then place a Beige Door piece in a Brown Outlined Door piece in which you place the Boggart Cupboard Sticker on, Now you can push the Beige Door and it will Swing around to show the Cupboard with the Boggart Mimicking Snape. You then place a formation of Dark Grey pieces on top of Half of the Black Hinge. You then place 2 Dark Grey Pylons at the Front of the Base plate, which you then place 2 Dark Grey Arch formations from the Brown Outlined Door piece. Then you place a&nbsp; Dark Grey Pylon In front of the Brown Outlined Door piece and a Dark Grey Arch piece from the Dark Grey Brick Formation on top of the Black Hinge, to the Dark Grey Pylon in front of that. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm sorry if that was hard to explain however I tried my best</span>. If you don't know what I meant simply download the Instructions from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Brickset.com</span> or <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Peeron.com</span> and you will see what I mean. You then Build a formation of Bricks around the Outlined Door piece and above the Table piece so it is all even. Above the 2 Dark Grey Pylons at the front you place 2 Sand Green Tiles with Grooves in them. Above the Brown table (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">That has the Chocolate Bar and Potion/Jars</span>) there is a long Dark Grey piece that resembles a tall shelf that is on the right of the Brown Outlined Door piece. Directly above where it stops and meets the Brown Outlined Piece you place a Sand Green Tile piece. On the edge of the Brown Outlined Door piece you place 2 2x2 Dark Grey pieces that on top have a Sloped Sand Green piece, and on the other end you do the exact same Technique however you use a Dark Grey Triangular piece for the bottom because that's where the second Black Hinge goes that's connected to the Office. Above the Boggart Cupboard and Brown Outlined Door piece you place a Skeleton Skull Mini-fig Head and beside that you place a Trans Red Cone with a Blue Stud on top. Diagonal from that where the Tall Dark Grey shelve is over the Brown Table you place a Trans Cobalt Cone with a Trans Yellow Stud on top. And next to that is one of the most Exquisite pieces in this set. It's a Trans-Neon Vermont Orange/Geranium Red Mini-fig Head and when held up to the Sun the colours just jump out and it looks Incredible. You then place 2 Brown Curved pieces next to the formations of Dark Grey 2x2 and Sand Green Sloped pieces that I mentioned earlier. They resemble the Roof of the Defense Against the Dark Arts Classroom and it looks Architecturally Phenomenally realistic. Above them you place a huge Black Arch piece and various Sand Green Slopes. You then place 2 White attachments and then you place 2 Animal Horse Head Amours with Wings resembling 2 Dragon Skulls which in the Movie there is one Hanging from the Roof, so again that adds a very realistic feel to the set. You then place various Sand Green Slopes again on the Black Arch piece and various Beige Cylindrical pieces, with a Light Grey Arched Window with a Black Crossed inside. And last but not least you place 1 small Dark Grey arch over the top of the Arch window piece and a Sharp Sand Green Roof piece. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Throughout the Instructions you connect the Classroom to the Office, Intentionally it is one entire Building Experience however I split it up to hopefully make it a less confusing review. </span><br style=""font-style: italic;""><br><h4>Overall:</h4><br>Overall I think this is a Fantastic addition to anyone's Lego Harry Potter Collection or Lego Collection. It is a Wonderful set full of admirable and interesting features that make the set Unique and Rare. I strongly recommend this set with full Confidence that you will enjoy it, a complete Triumph! <br><br>5/5 Thank you for taking the time to read my review :)",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
