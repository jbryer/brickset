"iplante","2014-08-28T03:15:16.14Z","Awesome model of the Eiffel Tower!","<p>This is my first and only architecture set so far. I received it as a gift for my birthday. I usually build small polybag sets or small creator 3-in-1 sets, so this was quite different.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very nice, can be closed again tight. The instructions come in a very fancy and thick booklet, with a lot of information about the Eiffel Tower. However, it&#39;s pretty hard to keep open so I used the PDF provided by LEGO.com to build.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not a huge collector, I don&#39;t do MOCs, and I haven&#39;t built a large variety of sets. Hence, I can&#39;t really judge the rarity of the pieces. However, there are some really cool hinged parts that I hadn&#39;t seen before (on a small 2x1 plate, for instance). I also liked the green smooth plates provided. The flexible &quot;studs,&quot; for lack of better term, which form the bottom arches, are pretty awesome as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took approximately an hour to complete. You start by building the base, and then the second tier of the tower, followed by its legs and the top part. It wasn&#39;t a hard build, but it was fun nonetheless and kept me busy for a while.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Having visited the actual tower, I can say that this model is great! The amount of details provided at such a small scale is amazing, and it&#39;s easily recognizable. The model is also very sturdy, so moving it around won&#39;t send parts flying all over.&nbsp;You can choose the name plate to be in French (La Tour Eiffel) or in English (The Eiffel Tower). I picked French as it&#39;s my first language, and I am grateful that LEGO included both languages!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set. It was a very nice introduction to the Architecture line, and I am now looking at the Leaning Tower of Pisa and many more! It&#39;s a fun build, has nice parts, and makes a great model to display!</p>

"Bricktech","2014-10-16T16:15:53.87Z","Taller Than You Think...","<p>Before I built this, I expected it to be about 6 inches tall. When it is done, it stands around 12 inches tall.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Very high quality, as with all Architecture and Ideas sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A great selection on light gray hinges, tiles, and plates, which are extremely useful for building MOCs. There&#39;s also a 4x4 round plate with an open middle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are many of the dreaded &quot;4X&quot; here, as you build each side of the tower, but it&#39;s worth it, as you see it come together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Is about a foot tall, and looks great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set, and well worth the money. The top half can pop off for easy transport, but the whole thing is quite sturdy.</p>

<p>A nice set of one of the most iconic buildings in the world. Despite the serious risk of repetitiveness (a whole lot of x4 builds / identical sides) the designer has managed to keep construction interesting. The construction design is very clever. Unfortunately, because of it, the construction is not rigid, and the tower can be bent. As with every Architecture set, it is relatively expensive, but overall it is justified. If there is one negative to mention, it is the rigidity of the building instructions booklet - one has to seriously crease it to keep the pages open. Overall, this set is well worth getting.</p>

<h2>Design of the set</h2>

<p>The designer has chosen to build the structure using mostly 1 x &#39;something&#39; something plates (modified and unmodified) that are clipped in to the platforms. It is a clever design choice, and overall IMHO a good one. It preserves the sleekness of the overall design, and approximates the curvature of the real thing quite well. The overall structure feels quite&nbsp;solid. The one thing they could have done is make the ground platform slightly bigger (14 x 14 studs rather than 12 x 12)&nbsp;I liked the fact that two tiles with the name tag (in English and French) are included. The use of flexi-bars to represent the arches supporting the 1st platform is a good one.</p>

<h2>Building the tower</h2>

<p>The building of the tower is quite repetitive; there is a lot of x4 building, the sides are also identical (so platforms have 4 identical sides) and the construction of the &#39;bars&#39; that form the corners could easily become very repetitive.</p>

<p>However, the designer has done a great job to prevent tediousness and repetitiveness as much as possible. A lot of 1x1 with clip tiles at odd (45 degree) angles are used as part of the construction.&nbsp;The platforms provide some rigidity&nbsp;to the structure as a whole, but it can still be bent. Construction itself is not difficult, most tricky being connecting the &#39;bars&#39; to the higher platforms 2/3rds&nbsp;up and at the top. Overall it took me about 40 minutes of building.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>As all architecture sets, this is above all a display set. The one &#39;play-feature&#39; is the fact that you can bend the structure over a little, showing off a crooked tower.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall this is a pretty good representation of one of the most iconic buildings in the world. Personally, I like it a lot and consider it well worth its price. If there is one negative, it is the rigid binding of the manual - the pages only fold over with great difficulty.</p>
