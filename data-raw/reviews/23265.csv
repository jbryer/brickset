<p>I saw this little bunny standing on the counter when buying some other sets, and decided to add it to my order. It looked funny, nice and fitting for the season as a bit of decoration at home. The build is quick and easy, though until the backplate / spine is added, the head tends to come of easily during construction. It is a nice, simple and effective design, and using the ears and eyes you can give it various expressions ranging from sad to happy. The carrot is slghtly oversized, but that is OK.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I like this Easter Bunny quite a bit, and do not regret getting it. And I would say, if you stumble upon it for a reasonable price, then seriously consider getting it.</p>

That&#39;s right, we&#39;re gonna be looking at the 2014 LEGO Easter set. It retailed for a surprisingly cheap $9.99, where it was introduced in March of 2014, and was retired in 2015, as it was a LEGO store and shop at home exclusive. It includes 106 pieces. Since this set was officially released under the name &quot;LEGO Easter,&quot; we&#39;re gonna start referring to him as &quot;Norman,&quot; because why not? Keep reading until the end of the review for some more interesting information unrelated to this LEGO set. Either way, let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure where to start. I specialise in CMF reviews, which means I typically begin at the top of the figure and progress downward, ending in the accessory or accessories. Perhaps I&#39;ll keep things relatively simple&nbsp;by beginning at the top, and working my way down. Of course, a bunny is no bunny without huge, ridiculous ears. This LEGO set captures that perfectly, with those 2 by 4 light grey slopes attached at a pole-and-clip connection that can be easily articulated to slope downward and upward, depending on Norman&#39;s mood. I appreciate the clip pieces being caste in light tan, as it does add an interesting colour palette to Norman.</p>

<p>Of course, Norman has some very intricate detailing around his head, with the slopes at the sides, front, and back. I do think the obtrusive grey slopes stick out and catch the eye a little, but it&#39;s no big deal whatsoever. I do suppose you can customize Norman using the studs on top. I suppose you can maybe add a hat or something to the top of the head, if Norman does so desire. I appreciate how the cheeks jut out from the sides of the face. Of course, a bunny is no bunny without a ridiculous set of pearly-whites, and this bunny packs them in using two 1 by 1 &quot;cheese slopes,&quot; as they&#39;re often referred to. I love that round, pink stud that is used to represent the nose. It&nbsp;has a nice little lip around the edge&nbsp;that really adds depth to the nose.&nbsp;Norman has two eyes that unintentionally penetrate your soul, and they are very common prints to get.</p>

<p>Moving down Norman&#39;s body, we have a very nice stature. I suppose Norman is popular with the doe community, as he looks very eye-catching, with how&nbsp;far his white stomach juts out past the torso. Perhaps he should lay off the carrots! I appreciate that band of dark grey plats layered dead centre of the torso, and the arms are attached at hinged plates at the sides. Norman&#39;s arms do look a little too thin and disjointed, but this was made in 2014, after all, so what should I expect? I appreciate the included carrot build, but we&#39;ll talk about that in a bit.</p>

<p>Of course the last segment of the body is the legs, and Norman&#39;s legs remind me more of a sledding slope than legs, but who am I to judge what Norman does in his free time? I like the 1 by 2 grey tiles for the feet, thought his toes do look a little too flat.</p>

<p>I suppose I forgot&nbsp;to discuss Norman&#39;s dorsal region, which is something I&#39;d love to talk about. I definitely think his back is more dedicated to the bunny&#39;s stability more than it is detail, which I guess is an option. There are some obviously obtrusive slopes at the top, and 4 exposed studs in the centre, which should have been covered with tiles. The fluffy white tail at the back looks equally obtrusive, where that 2 by 2 round brick sticks out, and is tipped with a 1 by 1 white cheese slope.</p>

<p>Lastly, we must take a look at Norman&#39;s massive carrot. I really like the tiny stem at the top, and the rounded edges of the carrot look good around the top and bottom. I&#39;m very interested with how that slope at the bottom is built. However, in order for Norman to wield his tasty veggie, there&#39;s a very horrid looking square portion in the middle of the vegetable. I can&#39;t really think of a way around that, but if I were Norman, I&#39;d probably have some painful moments whilst devouring the treat.</p>

<p>That is it for my review of Norman. To be completely transparent, I mostly wrote this review to have fun. This review isn&#39;t meant to be taken seriously, but in the end, I am gonna be a little serious with my verdict. All in all, I think this is a pretty great build! It does have problems, like the hideous plate at the back, and that very rectangular portion of the carrot, but all in all, I dig this design! Is it my favourite LEGO Easter Bunny? Certainly not. Is it one of the best? Absolutely!</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna give this figure an overall score of 4 out of 5. My score for the building experience is gonna have to be 3 out of 5, as it isn&#39;t anything super enjoyable. Parts are gonna ring in at 3 out of 5 as well. The playability of him comes in at 2 out of 5, since he really doesn&#39;t do anything that impressive. Lastly, the value for money comes out at a solid 5 out of 5, since I would normally expect Norman to retail for $15.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and happy Easter! I may have said earlier in the review that Easter was solely about LEGO, but I think we all know that isn&#39;t the case. Easter is about Jesus rising from the tomb. Whether or not you believe that is for you to decide, but whatever the case, let&#39;s not forgot why we celebrate this blessed holiday! Thanks for reading, and stay safe!</p>
