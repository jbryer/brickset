and a dementor.It is perfect and I have only one thing:it's
sopposed to be taller.But that doesn't matter because that
would have driven up the price and it's perfectly priced.In
all,definetly worth your money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-04T04:43:34Z","Exiting set!","This set is very cool and for a great price!
having four curved walls is very nice and other curved peices. plus 2 arched windows. I dont mind the new flesh colours, but Im not convinced of the new greys, because when they are placed beside an old grey brick, wether dark or light, the old greys look realy bad compared to the new.
Buckbeak is awesome!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-28T01:42:59Z","What the heck is a Hippogriff?!?!?!","PROs
Excellent piece selection, lots of multiples
It has the 'hippogriff' (named Buckbeak as I have come to find out)
Pretty solid for 1) a small model and 2) being able to open
3 minifigs, well, 2 and a half...-ish

CONs
The colors are fairly limited, but I guess that keeps with the theme
It has one of those big doorway pieces (I would've much rather would have built it on my own, but that's just me)

CONCLUSION
	If you are searching for parts this is the way to go.  This has several multiples of many pieces, most of the elements of the lower half of the model is in multiples of four.  The minifigs are good.  I haven't been completely sold on the flesh color just yet.  But, then again I didn’t really buy it for the ‘figs.  

	Overall, I would recommend this set to fans and parts hunters alike.

p.s. If you are still wondering, a Hippogriff is a cross between a horse and an eagle. :-)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Great mini-figures, the dementor is really cool and Buckbeak is even cooler. Definetly reccomended over Lupins classroom.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-18T21:52:17Z","Sirius Black has escaped!!!","Great set, definetly one of the best 20.00 HP sets. The Hippogriff is really well done, I was worried that it would simpley be a horse and that the wings would be added using bricks but I was wrong, it was completely new mold, I wish lego would realize theat not all us girls are interested in belville and give us more sets like this, but in a pink color :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-14T10:42:41Z","Great!","I got 2 of these for $10.00 each! I really like the parts in this set! Black Goblet, 1x4 tan arch, HP door, curved walls and other bricks, hinges! Awesome parts! I just wish the dementor had sand green skeleton legs to complete him, He would make a good general for my undead army.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-23T14:19:37Z","&quot;Maybe you can save two lives&quot;","This set is nice. It has Sirius Black, a dementor and Buckbeak the Hippogrif. Oh yeah, and another Harry.
The building is nice. on the first floor is a room with a desk and a key, Maybe professor Flitwick's desk. In the book Sirius was locked up in Flitwick's office.
On the second floor is the filmprison of PoA. It has a room where Sirius is locked up and a nice 1*1 tile with a lock on it. The Curved &quot;macaroni&quot; Bricks are nice
I agree with the man before me ( I thought it was mr. Tran, but I forgot his name, my apologies ) that this set is overprized.
If I'm right the dollar is on this moment 1,3* 1 Euro so he must pay 1,3*34= 44,20 euro.
I find 30 euro already to much, 25 should be right.
I think you paid for the license from Warnerbrothers.
But overall, It is a nice set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T03:58:26Z","Good pieces in there!","It has 4 &quot;quarter-round castle wall&quot; and a wal-with-door. It really deserves a score better than 1/10. However, it's too short. I wish it was a taller building so that it would be compatible with other HP buildings.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-27T11:25:46.213Z","LEGO Harry Potter - Sirius Black's Escape Review","This set is my last Harry Potter set and the third and last set for the movie 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban' which I've got. This set was part of the end of the movie when Harry Potter and Hermione Granger rescued Sirius Black.<br><br>What surprised me is that this set comes with a dementor minifig instead of Hermione. But it's the cheapest way to get one of the older LEGO Harry Potter dementor minifigs. That creature comes with a nice leg which I've only seen in this theme. What also surprised me about that minifig is that the dementor has a green skin. In the movies the dementors had been black and gray. Now LEGO changed that problem in the newest Harry Potter sets.<br><br>This is also the second set which includes buckbeak and this is also the cheapest way to get Sirius Black who is Harry's godfather. This set was fun to build and I like the way how LEGO did the tower. We get a balcony and you can also open the tower where you can see a table and a brown rat in the inside. There're lot's of gray, dark gray and tan pieces which are really nice for MOC's and/or brickfilms.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"LegoAdventures","2011-01-23T18:59:11.007Z","Sirius Black's Escape","What an Outstanding set!. I honestly think this set looks Wonderful, It's a Superb remake of the scene in which Harry and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Hermione</span> rescue Sirius Black with Buckbeak the Hippogriff, And I think Lego did this set justice because it is a Superior set. Released in 2004 to coincide with the Blockbuster release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span>, it contains 189 Pieces, 3 Mini-figures, Buckbeak and the Prison Tower. I managed to get this set from Bricklink.com in a New Sealed Box in Excellent Condition for $80 AUD, and I can strongly say do not surpass the opportunity to get this set!.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br><br></span><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions:</h4><br>The Box is 18.9cm Long, 29cm Tall and 5.8cm Thick. It consists of the Usual features and offerings you find, like the front Illustration of the Prison Tower, Buckbeak, Dementor and Harry, and the usual Red Lego Insignia. Around the sides and back and small section of the front of the Box is covered in the colour Blue. At the back of the Box there is an Illustration of all the Prisoner of Azkaban sets (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apart from the Exclusive 10132 Motorized Hogwarts Express</span>). All the sets are Trans-White and see through except Sirius Blacks Escape which isn't see through, it is in colour. A feature you find on all Prisoner of Azkaban Boxes, Instructions and Pamphlets. There is an image of inside the Set and 1 Alternative Model of the set which you can download from LEGO.com, however i don't think the Link is there anymore. Other features include other angles of the set and Mini-figures. On the side of the Box there is Future References, Licensed Agreements, Trademarks, Copyrights and where the Components are made, for this particular set the Components are made in Denmark, Sweden, Korea and the Czech Republic (I'm guessing the pieces are made in Denmark, Sweden and the Czech Republic (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pronounced Check Republic if you didn't already know</span>) and the Box or packaging is made in Korea) After all that's what I love about Lego is that It's Quality European Manufactured. Inside the Box there is 3 Plastic Bags, not numbered so the Building Experience may be a bit more challenging. There is also the 33 Instruction Booklet, 40 including the Illustrations at the back.<br><br><h4>Mini-figs:</h4><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Harry James Potter:</span> </span>Harry Potter features his Black Messy hair, Red scar, Round glasses with  Sparkling eyes and simple smile. He also features the new Dark Grey  Hogwarts Uniform and sweater, with Gold and Crimson Red Tie, White  Collar and stitching around the Neck and bottom of the sweater. There is  also a Gold and Crimson Red lace around the bottom of the sweater and  various black lines, showing he is so active and adventurous that he's  uniform is always messy and not neat. And last but not least he also  features his Dark Grey pants, and Black Cape resembling his Robes. <br><br style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Sirius Black</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> also known as </span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Padfoot:</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span> Sirius Black features long Greasy Hair.

There is also various Tears  and Marks around the Outfit. And last but not least he has Dark Grey  pants.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Dementors:</span> ""The Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures that walk this Planet"",  a  once wise Professor Lupin said to Harry and to be honest I think  Lego did an Astronomically wonderful job on the creepy design factor.  The Dementor looks Diminishing, vile, cruel and spooky. It features a Sand Green face which looks like it's Sucking the Soul out of  someone and it's Skeletal body and loose Skeletal arms covered with a  tatty Cloak with one leg resembling It floating give It an image  that could chill the bone. <br><br>You also receive <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Buckbeak </span>(<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Hippogriff</span>)  which is a complete custom piece and looks incredible.

You then place some Dark Grey Curved pieces which will start the bottom structure of the Prison Tower. You then place 1 1x4 Dark Grey plate, then you place a Brown 1x4 plate on top of that and then you place a Beige 1x4 Tile on top of that to make a small structure that will be used later in the Building Experience. You then place a different type of Hinge that allows you to tilt things back and fourth. You then build a small formation that appears to be a Brown Desk with a secret compartment that has a White Tile peice with a Printed Bag that has been opened and has a Bone, Black Spider with a White pattern on it's Abdomen that looks like this: olo, And stars coming out of the bag. Inside the Secret compartment there is 2 Dark Grey Keys which you simply lift a Brown 2x4 piece and the Keys are revealed. You then place that over the different Hinge (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Allows you to Tilt the piece</span>) and the formation of 1x4 Dark Grey, 1x4 Brown, and 1x4 Beige piece. On top of the completed Desk you place a Trans-Neon Yellow-Green Cylindrical piece thats holding a Trans-Neon Navy Blue Diamond.

"bajadogq","2009-12-15T12:09:47.653Z","Hippogriff Escape","This set has almost all that one can ask from it. It's a small castle tower with three minifigures (Harry, Sirius, and a dementor) and Buckbeak the hippogriff. The upper floor consists of a balcony and a small room with a door and two windows. Inside the room is a torch and a small table. The inside of the lower level is more prison-like. It includes a rat and a tiny table and bench (which is not even big enough for a minifigure to sit on). The table can swing over to reveal a secret compartment where keys can be found inside. As for the minifigs, they're pretty great. Sirius looks like the rough, torn up rebel he is, while the dementor is ominous, as it should be. Harry looks just like his movie counterpart. Buckbeak is neat and very swooshable. My only complaint is that he can only fit one minifigure on his back, not two. This set is high in playability, and I greatly recommend it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoMunchy88","2011-08-02T13:28:53.45Z","My Only Prisoner of Azkaban Set...","<p>Well, I'm going to start this review by simply stating that The Prisoner of Azkaban was, in my opinion, the worst Harry Potter movie, and I have seen them all. This could have possibly been for me because a lack of a strong plot and the dissapointing skirmish in the Shreiking Shack. Nevertheless, this is a great set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>Sirius Black- This minifigure is good, but his hair piece does not fit. First of all, it looks nothing like Sirius's all over the place Azkaban prisoner hair like in the movie. Also, Sirius's hair is brown, not black. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harry Potter- As always, we see another Harry Potter, apparently hinting toward the fact that he has access to a cloning machine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dementor- Easily the best figure of the set. The stand piece on mine is broken, which would suggest that its flimsy, but apparently no one else has had that problem. I'm considering getting a new one from Costumer Service, though. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p>The tower, Sirius Black's cell at Hogwarts, is really very nice. I'll start with the bottom floor. I'm curious as to how Harry is supposed to get in there to get the key. I know it's hinged, but is it really that probable that the tower can just open up? I don't know.... </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upstairs floor of the tower is awesome, and my favorite thing to do in the entire set if to stick the key in the keyhole and push to lock piece off. There are two main flaws, though. First, there is no real place for Buckbeak. I know that you can technically land him on that balcony, but he takes up the whole thing and it is very difficult for Harry to get off once Buckbeak lands. The second major flaw of this set is that the lock is on the balcony, and for someone like me who likes to do that thing with the key, it means to would have to unlock it from the cell, unless you just move the lock, I guess. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>Overall, LEGO 4753 Sirius Black's escape is good set with great figs and an awesome tower. There are a few minor flaws, but it's very well done overall. </p>
