When I got the Playstation 3 I said to myself I wanted to see what this title was like first hand, so I picked up the PS3 copy dirt cheap. As I own both copies of the game, if I ever get a Wii U I&rsquo;ll probably review the differences between them, until then let us discuss the merits of this title from 2013.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Presentation</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Right off the bat I will say that the case is very nice looking and the graphics, despite being on a last gen console are still quite impressive. There&rsquo;s a lot of nice layouts and the character models are very nicely built.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">However, like with many previous TT games there can be times when things will lag, slow down or worse, freeze up when too much action is happening on screen. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s just my copy, the location of where my system is in relation to the television or some other factors, but I have also noticed a lot of graphical oddities. The biggest of which is when I&rsquo;m in the New York Hub World, every five minutes or so the screen will have this ugly wave flowing from top to bottom&hellip; like the tracking on an old VHS cassette is out of alignment.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Being as this is a disc based game the likely problem is too many characters and moving items on screen, the hub world is vast and populated with a lot of citizens, which can cause visual glitches. Characters will walk through walls, floors and worse when a lot of them are onscreen.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There are no Minifigures included with this title as far as I am aware, the Wii U copy I originally picked up did however include the Gun mounting system Polybag with Iron Patriot. I cannot recall if other copies included this polybag at launch or if it was just the Nintendo version, hence why I picked that title up for that system first as opposed to another.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Contents</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Now we come down to the game itself. I&rsquo;m not sure where to start, so we&rsquo;ll just get this straight out of the way. Whoever designed the flight and vehicle controls should be fired. Flying in this game has a very poor control method, you have to press down on an action button to rise or descend&hellip; Now it&rsquo;s been some time since I last touched LEGO Batman 3, but I do not recall if these flight controls were used there, so forgive me if I&rsquo;m just out of practice, but seriously a dedicated flight control scheme where you ascend and descend simply by using the joystick would be extremely smoother in my opinion, especially when handling the aerial races.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As far as driving vehicles is concerned, the biggest flaw is that there is no dedicated drift mechanic for tight turns. If you need to race against an AI opponent to achieve certain unlockables then you also need to be able to handle the cars and bikes just like in a regular racing game. The handling of these vehicles can be clunky and exceptionally frustrating, especially as the Hub world where races are performed just LOVES to throw oncoming traffic directly in your path. Granted this can help you as the oncoming traffic also hinders your opponents, but it just isn&rsquo;t as satisfying if you&rsquo;re winning a race because some AI NPC driving another vehicle stalled out your race opponent.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">On top of that there are certain races where you need to cheat to win, the only way to successfully beat Maria Hill while go-karting is to push her vehicle out of the way before you start the race, then you can handle her even with the terrible turn controls.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This may all seem like minor complaints, but for folks who have been following Traveler&rsquo;s Tales for a long time you&rsquo;ll find that the same issues plague their LEGO titles even to this day, you get to enjoy the fun of building and smashing and controlling tons of characters in a massive free-for-all campaign to unlock even more characters, comics and other elements. But you will continue to run into the same problems, horrible vehicle controls, screen freezing glitches due to too much action on screen and the system just can&rsquo;t handle it, or rather the game engine I should say. Especially when you have the elusive Deadpool Bricks active, they will constantly cause bugs and glitches that would have been stamped out in other titles if the developers had any inclination to work on repairing them after the fact.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The main gameplay and storyline are unique to Marvel, and the hub world is a massive sprawling city scape even larger than Gotham, or so it seems, as the hub world has a lot to see and do, including several bonus levels to unlock with gold bricks so you can play in Deadpool&rsquo;s levels where you can find his Deadpool Bricks and unlock the extras typically found in LEGO Games. There are so many characters to play as you may find yourself never getting to use any of the heroes you&rsquo;d prefer to. And the character customizer continues to impress, though custom characters seem to trigger the game freezing glitch more often than the readymade figures.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I will never stop enjoying LEGO Games, I love the charm and fun of the simple titles. That being said they are starting to get a little more challenging in my opinion. There are tasks being asked of young players that I, a grown adult, felt very ill prepared for. It didn&rsquo;t help that the impossibly frustrating vehicle controls lead many a rage fuelled shriek of despair, especially one part where a remote control car must be driven on a roof, that particular race through rings for a Gold Brick was a very painful chore to do. As my fingers can attest to.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Be that as it may, I do still recommend this one, provided you are a huge fan of LEGO Marvel or Marvel in general and can get past the gruelling hours of resetting your system because it decided to freeze on you again despite nothing too strenuous going on onscreen.</span></span></span></span></p>
