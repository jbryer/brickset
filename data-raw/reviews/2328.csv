"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-20T05:36:41Z","Nice... nice...... nice......","It earns 9/10 as it looks really nice from the outside. The combination of colours of exterior is cool and it has real roof unlike the previous one.

The pumpkin plants are so cute plus the gadgets/tools inside the wooden barrel outside the hut. The chimney is great too (it's movable and a book is hidden behind it). 

The deducted 1 mark is due to the 'a bit mixed up colour of the interior'. It would be perfect if the brown bricks on the wall all disappear......

Lastly, a 'must-buy' item as it has 4 castle corner walls. I'm a castle fan and those corner walls will be useful for my big castle to be built. I might buy another set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legolander","2007-04-30T04:10:26.78Z","Definitely better than the first model...","This is another of the best sets that I own. It's a good thing I didn't buy the first version of this set. This looks better than the old Hagrid's Hut. It has LEGO plates as the roof and it also has the pumpkin patch. Too bad they only placed 2 pumpkins. They should have at least a separate place for the pumkin patch. Anyway, this set looks very nice. It has secret compartments inside, like the hinged fireplace where a book is hidden. A very nice set indeed! I give it 4 stars! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

These are the things I think of when describing Hagrid's Hut, It's a place that's welcoming and comfortable, full of Mysterious Magical things, Secrets and Treasures. I'd say Lego really did this set justice, because it is one of the Best Hagrid's Hut's that Lego have ever created and it really captures all the Enchantment, Warmth and Magic within. <br>Released in 2004 to coincide with the Blockbuster release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span>, it is the Second Hagrid's Hut to be released by Lego (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The first Hagrid's Hut being 4707 release in 2001</span>) It contains 302 Pieces, 2 Mini figures and the main feature of this set, Hagrid's Hut. This set I managed to get of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bricklink.com</span> for $83 AUD In a New Sealed Box in Excellent Condition and i can strongly say it was well worth the money for this wonderful set.<br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions:</h4><br>The Box is 28.2cm Long, 28.2 Tall and 5.8cm Thick. The Box has the usual front Illustration of Hagrid's Hut and all it's offerings like the Red Lego insignia. Around all 4 sides, the back and some of the front of the Box is covered in the colour blue like most of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban sets</span>. At the back there is an image of all the Prisoner of Azkaban sets (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apart from the Exclusive 10132 Motorized Hogwarts Express</span>) All the sets are Trans-White and see through, except Hagrid's Hut which has colour and isn't see through. These illustrations are on all of the Prisoner of Azkaban set's, Instructions and Pamphlets included. There is an Alternative model of the set, which you can get the Instructions on LEGO.com, however I don't think the Link is there anymore. There is also numerous images of inside the Hut and images of the Mini-figures. There is also the usual Trademarks, Licensed Agreements, Copyrights and where the Components are made, for this set the Components are made in Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden and Korea. (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm guessing the pieces are made in Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden, and the packaging or Box is made in Korea</span>) After all that's what i love about Lego is that it's Quality European Manufactured. Inside the Box you receive 4 Plastic Bags which aren't numbered. And last but not least the 41 page Instruction Booklet, 48 including the Illustration's at the back. <br><br><h4>Mini-figs:</h4><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Professor Rubeus Hagrid:</span> ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Keeper of Key's and Grounds at Hogwarts</span>"".

He also has a large Brown belt with a Big Silver buckle holding the belt together. He has large Brown movable arms with his Pale hands. And last but not least his large Brown Boots. Hagrid is a wonderful Mini-fig and when fully constructed, you just wanna cuddle him <span style=""font-style: italic;"">hehe</span>. <br><br style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Hermione Jean Granger:</span> Hermione features her beautiful curly Brunette hair, Sparkling Black eyes and Gorgeous Red lips, with 2 Black lines next to the lips resembling her smiling. Hermione's Torso features the new Dark Grey Hogwarts School Uniform and sweater, with Gold and Crimson Red tie, White Collar and stitching around the neck and bottom of the sweater.

She features the Time-Turner around her Neck which has Metallic Gold, and a small Hour Glass, it has spectacular detail when looked at closely. And last but not least Hermione features a wonderful Black Cape resembling her Hogwarts Robes. <br><br><h4>Hagrid's Hut:</h4><br>This is the Main features of the set, and i have to say it is Spectacular!. The Hut itself has hinges inside it to enable you to open the entire set and play within the inside. You start of by Building the Dark Grey floor of the Hut and the 3 Large Grey Steps for the Front Entrance. You then Build numerous starting foundations for various features in the set which become fully built throughout the Building Experience. There is 2 Large Chestnut Brown door's in this set. One for the Front Entrance and one for the Back Entrance. Inside the Hut there is a Large Brown Table with 1 Large Brown bench to sit on. On top of the Large Brown Table is 1 White Mug/Cup with a handle, 1 Bright Geranium Red Mug/Cup with handle, 1 Metallic Gold Goblet Cup and 1 Bright Yellow Dish/Plate. In the middle of the Hut on the floor is a Brown Rat identical to Ron's Scabbers. Right next to that Rat is a small Fireplace with 2 Fire pieces. To the left of the Fireplace is a small Brown L shaped table with a Lime Green Cone shaped Lego piece that is holding a Trans-Neon Orange Diamond. In front the Diamond and Cone piece is a Beautiful Black Cauldron piece with a very rare Yellow ladle spoon piece inside it. Throughout all these features you build various wall elements and arches over the back Door and Fireplace. To the Left of the back Door is a wall formation that has a Trans-Neon Yellow Lantern type piece, A Black Axe and a Brown Crossbow, and when pushed it turns around to reveal a Trans-Neon Orange spider, on top of this formation is a Dark Grey Bat. You then finish with a Window next to the Brown Table which enables you to open and shut the windows. After placing the Chestnut Brown Door for the Front Entrance there is a small custom wall piece with various printed bricks. (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Note: This is the only Custom wall piece out of the 4 that have this pattern</span>) On the Left of the Chestnut Brown Door is 2 Pumpkins (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mini-fig heads</span>) You also place 2 Emerald Green plant type pieces with 3 huge leaves on them, resembling the Pumpkins that are still in the ground. Once all 4 wall structures have been built, you build some Green roof formations around all the edges of the Hut, and then the 4 Giant Hut roof pieces for the proper roof.&nbsp; You then place a Brown Barrel near the Back Door which has a Dark Grey Shovel and a Dark Grey Pick axe. And last but not least you then Build the back of the Fireplace which has a hidden Brown Book inside it that you can see through a Trans-Clear Glass piece. <br><br><h4>Overall: </h4><br>The set is Superior!, It really captures the Magical and Enchanting feeling of Hagrid's Hut. It is a set that can be played with for hour's upon hour's and is full of playability. So Overall i strongly recommend this set to anyone with full confidence you will enjoy it, it is a complete Triumph! 5/5<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review :)",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
