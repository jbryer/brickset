"Odeinoichus","2016-07-31T22:22:37.577Z","Baking More Treats","<p><strong>Set #30113 Stephanie&rsquo;s Bakery Stand: </strong>Stephanie is a huge fan of baked treats, to the point that she&rsquo;s had quite a number of sets involving her and baked goods. This Polybag introduces a nice little stand for the side of a road or park pathway where she can set up her wares and make some money selling to her friends, or other denizens of Heartlake City.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is highly detailed for such a small number of pieces and includes some interesting pieces, including some orange half plates, pink and dark pink sloped bricks and printed Strawberry stud. The height of the model also works quite well with Mini-Dolls, Stephanie can stand beside it and still see everything.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Stephanie Mini-Doll is exclusive to this set apparently, with maroon skirt and flower printed olive top.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Includes Pretzel, printed cookie studs and buildable treats as accessories.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Nothing major to speak of.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a solid Polybag from the Friends Theme and definitely worth tracking down, it has had sporadic availability in 2013 and so does make it somewhat harder to find compared to other sets. Still recommend tracking it down for your collection.</p>
