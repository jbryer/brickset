However it&#39;s a fairly impressive little set for impulse shoppers and fans of the Polybag style.</p>

<p>Emma&#39;s Flower Stand is a solid little build using a little over 30 pieces the stand itself isn&#39;t doing anything new with the build, we&#39;ve seen similar designs in other sets and polybags. It looks elegant in it&#39;s simplicity however and offers a lot of various plants for sale, from regular flower stems to a nice red bucket/planter with a young plant just starting to grow. There aren&#39;t too many unique Friends colours in this set, you get two small blue sloped bricks and a purple 2x4 plate, other than that the colours in the set are fairly typical.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a small purple cylinder brick with a plant growing out of it, not sure if it&#39;s for sale or just set decoration however it&#39;s an extra build to put next to the stand. The Emma Mini-Doll is unique to this Polybag, the parts aren&#39;t unique we&#39;ve seen them before just not in this combination. She carries a broom, perhaps to sweep up loose soil from her plants that get knocked off the stand.</p>

<p>Overall while there isn&#39;t much going for it, the Friends Polybags are always a solid build offering some nice little set pieces to put around your Heartlake City displays. The parts aren&#39;t terribly unique either for parts packs, however I always enjoy the Friends Polybags and would like it if they showed up more often on the shelf. I think I found this set in January and haven&#39;t seen any others since then. I recommend it to fans of the Theme and fans of Polybags because you can never go wrong with polybags... Well hardly ever, as you&#39;ll see in one of my upcoming reviews.</p>
