<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The printing on the plastic polybags for these two sets is really quite nice, the Tumbler zooms off the package and you can get a definite feel for the car you&#39;re going to build. I will say that it slightly covers up some odd design choices, but I&#39;ll touch on that down below.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve said it once and I&#39;ll say it again, I really dislike the instructions packaged with each polybag. I don&#39;t like the folding... but that&#39;s probably just me.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Who doesn&#39;t need more wheels in their collections lol? Pretty varied though basic bag of parts, mostly in black. I do like that it has two black hinged &#39;flag&#39; pieces though, I always can think of neat ideas with those.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I pity the Minifigure that gets crammed into this little car, it&#39;s quite small!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Honestly easier to build and find the pieces versus the Batwing build, as the black plates and bricks are more varied then that set. It does have a couple instances of SNOT building so it might be a good start to a new builder&#39;s career, such as a child or partner.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s where we get to the meat of the review. I love the idea of it, but it&#39;s a little smaller than I thought it would be. The scale is off when placing it next to the Batwing, and it&#39;s not honestly as impressive as the picture would pretend. It has a lot of oddly exposed studs that could have been covered with some 1X1&nbsp;tiles or more arches/half arches. It&#39;s definitely rough and tumbly looking which I guess is all we could want.</p>

<p>There is one peculiar thing to add that wasn&#39;t immediately noticeable in the picture, and that&#39;s what the front wheel assembly looks like at different angles. It&#39;s hard to explain without a picture so take a look (and sorry for the filter, I needed more light to see the problem):</p>

<p>Because the build uses &#39;flag&#39; pieces for the front wheel assembly, there are holes noticeable in the model. While they may be small, in such a small model it is pretty big and glaring. Because of the angle that is displayed on the bag you wouldn&#39;t know until you built it and looked it over.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&#39;m torn. I like the idea more then the actual build, and can see this as a jumping off point for someone wanting to build their own Tumbler. As it stands it&#39;s a polybag that has 57 pieces so you can&#39;t really bawk&nbsp;at the value. For those wanting an influx of tiny black pieces this is for you.</p>

While some of the time you find yourself asking why? Or they&nbsp;could maybe stand a few extra steps in the design process, other times you just have to have some of them in spite of other&#39;s opinions. This is a really great Polybag for this year, and here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>1) An inexpensive fun little build that captures the look and spirit of the Dark Knight trilogy titular vehicle design.</p>

<p>2) Clever build design and use of parts to capture the likeness of the Tumbler vehicle. When I first built this model I was impressed with the use of the black flag/fin pieces for the side panels of the vehicle.</p>

<p>3) Just really fun to play with, great desk toy or something to grab off your shelf to fiddle with.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>1) Fairly squat design makes this powerful vehicle look a little bit smaller than it could have been with different pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than that I don&#39;t really see much against this particular build, in my opinion it is a must own set and really great fun to own. Definitely recommend this for fans of polybags or Batman, definitely something to track down. Was around for at least five months at Canadian Targets by the cash registers as a really great impulse purchase.</p>
