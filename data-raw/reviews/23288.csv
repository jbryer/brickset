"legogal","2014-04-09T18:15:12.54Z","the Friends' jewelry box is a real winner!","<p style=""font-size: medium;"">This&nbsp;set was&nbsp;in the Raleigh LEGO Store yesterday, and it is a real jewel! A perfect gift for those daughters, wives, sisters, aunts, nieces,&nbsp;granddaughters, grandmothers and&nbsp;friends in your life. What a value for under&nbsp;15US.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The box is large at 10.25x5.5x2.75 inches and brightly colored like most Friends&#39; boxes. The 28 pages of instructions are quite&nbsp;clear for&nbsp;the listed&nbsp;six plus age group. There are plenty of four year olds who can probably put most of this together if you are&nbsp;willing to help with the hinges.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The build took me about fifteen&nbsp;enjoyable minutes while listening to the birds chirp on our porch. It is sheer fun with the only complicated part being the hinges, which consist of two 4505842 technic parts on each corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">There are 116 bold colored parts out of the 201 total parts, and 55 of those 116 are tiles in&nbsp;colors&nbsp;that just&nbsp;jump out at you. If you need bright pastel tiles, this is the inexpensive set for you. Just looking at those colors made my heart jump.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">There are no&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;with this set, and you have to supply your own jewelry or whatever to go inside. The finished box measures 5 x 3.75.2.5 inches with the smaller tray at 1.75 x 1.25 x .65 inches and the small inside box at 1.85 x 1.85 x 1 inches. The smaller inside box and tray are just as brightly colored as the outside box.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Advice for&nbsp;dummies: If&nbsp;you have another small gift (or two or three) for the above person, it should look wonderful inside this&nbsp;jewelry box. Take it to a store and fill it with adorable young looking costume jewelry unless you know of a specific piece of jewelry that the recipient has asked for or left hints about. Or the recipient&#39;s favorite&nbsp;minifigs. Whatever...</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">This set is a winner&nbsp;whether you are buying it for a jewelry box or parts. And a great way to use some of your &nbsp;VIP points. In the US, if you buy from Lego before the&nbsp;16th, they throw in a free&nbsp;Friends&#39; 30113, Stephanie&#39;s Bakery Cart.&nbsp;</p>
