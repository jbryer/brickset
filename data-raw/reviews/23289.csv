<p>Polybag&nbsp;was nothing special. &nbsp;Instructions were easy to follow but small, maybe a little hard to view but it&#39;s really not a problem because it&#39;s such a simple build.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I love the idea of a crate for the getaway vehicle for the robber! &nbsp;His backpack and money accessories fit really well and are a nice inclusion for the price. &nbsp;The lifejacket for the police officer is a good color and good add.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minis are the highlight of this set. &nbsp;For less (each) than the price of a blind bag figure, you are getting a decent figure, plus accesories, plus a vehicle!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing too complicated.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The robber/boat is fine. &nbsp;The police model works well but I think the propeller or lack thereof is a little weak.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Get this set... makes a great filler for City scenes or even as background for Super Heroes!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-07-05T14:34:53.33Z","Another Crook in LEGO City","<p>Set #30227 Police Watercraft: LEGO Enjoys producing City Polybags, we&#39;ve had loads of them over the years. And as a Polybag collector I was pleased to find this one available recentish, this is a pretty good bargain actually and here are the Pros and Cons of it.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>1) Two Mini-Figures in one Polybag, a rarity from LEGO. The last one I saw personally was the LEGO City Jet Ski Poly. This means instant play time once everything is built.</p>

<p>2) Fast and easy to build and play with, like most Polybags. As a bonus you have a little adventure story set up by the image on the polybag.</p>

<p>3) Brown oar piece is something we don&#39;t see much of these days with the Pirates Theme retired, also the Police Watercraft is a nice little build that will fit in well with the rest of your City Theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>1) Crook is escaping in a crate, I understand not being able to include enough pieces for both Mini-Figures to have a fast water vehicle, but this is one silly crook to think he can outrun a motor powered vehicle with an oar. Perhaps a silly excuse for a con, but it does affect the fun of the set just a little bit.</p>

<p>2) No new prints, these Mini-Figures can be found in loads of other sets. Chances are you already own many variations on them if you collect LEGO City&#39;s Theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly, as far as polybag collecting goes in spite of the Mini-Figures not being unique to the set this is still a great set to have. It&#39;s a simple fun build without much to speak of, and perhaps a bit of a silly con for some people, but it&#39;s still very much worth owning for Polybag enthusiasts. Considering how rare two Mini-Figures in one Polybag are that&#39;s one of the must have reasons for owning this set in your collection, especially if you like keeping Polybags sealed.</p>

<p>I kind of wish this set would have included the rarer female crook from LEGO City though, it would have been a nice change of pace compared to the typical male crook found in many sets and would have been a cheaper alternative to buying her for mini-figure collectors. Still an ok set and great for kids to just pop open, build and have fun instantly playing out an adventure on the car ride home... As long as they&#39;re careful not to loose any pieces in the car. Recommended.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A big polybag with a&nbsp;&nbsp;single sheet of instructions</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some useful rounded slopes and the boat hull sections (and a crate) but its the figures that are the best part.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Standard stubbly crook with a backpack, money tiles, an oar and a comedy crate boat. AND a navy blue police man with the new cap, lifejacket and binoculars. Great value</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very quick and conventional, the jetski&nbsp;is very solid so this a great set for play.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The jetski is a bit plain and its pretty simple but it serves the purpose just fine, the rest of the build is just minifigs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Hard to fault for value, yes its a bit silly that the crook is rowing a crate but kids think its funny and that&#39;s all that matters. Can be found for under &pound;3 on ebay so makes a great stocking filler or pocket money present.</p>
