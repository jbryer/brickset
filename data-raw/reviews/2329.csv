"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-31T01:58:56Z","3 shades of perple?","Yes, this is one great set, lots of good pieces. There are 2 bad things i could come up with. 
1 the back door is a 2 tall and 3 long door, quit rare but does not come with another one if you wanted tobuild a car.
2 the perple color is in 3 shades if you look at it closely.
Overall it is a great set it may not be a &quot;must buy&quot; but it is close.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-10T13:49:23Z","Brilliant","I too bought this from Argos at $19.99 on March 9, anyway, this is a great set!!! I have it and it is ace. There are new flesh toned figures which are pretty cool. The Grim though, I thought was gonna be bigger but... The door on the back is pretty cool to let your minifigs on and off instead of having to pull off all the decks. The sliding beds is a nice feature. You can also take off the roof and decks to see inside while the bus moves! (not by itself, of course lol)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-07T02:33:14Z","WOOWIE!!!!!","i have it. it has Sirius as a dog ,Stan the driverand Harry Potter. It has three beds with pillows, a back door, a dark-grey lanturnpole wich is new in that color, the trunk of Harry is a bit more cherrywood (more red i mean) and it has 2 knight bus signs. But the smal windows does not has glass in it but that's ok.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-13T04:01:25Z","good stuff!","overall a very good set with plenty of useful pieces and of course its in the new purple colour.

PROS:useful purple pieces, could easily make 3 purple buses/hippy vans/gang vehicles. if you swop the minifigs' hands for yellow ones they could be put to good use. pillows could come in useful as would the dog.

CONS:annoying incompatable skin tones! (in my set a piece was missing0
      Overall a great set!  recommendable to any children or lego inthusiasts   :}",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T16:24:25Z"," Hello.","This set could have done better with:

A latter to get up and downstairs.
Ernie.
Could have been longer, so on each level you could fit 3 beds.
A luugage compartment.

This set is very cool set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Tri_pod_king","2008-07-17T18:01:40.39Z","''Welcome to the Knight Bus, transportation for the stranded witch or wizard.''","I don't care what it is, this set is AWESOME! You get a load of purple pieces, it's very sturdy, and great for play and display purposes, but especially good for play purposes. Includes detailed figures, and my favorite Harry Potter minifig I have ever gotten. Although I would've added a place for Harry's trunk and Hedwig. I would've made a cage for Hedwig. Well, now that I think about it, there was some room for the trunk and possibly Hedwig. This set is also quite movie accurate and I hope that Lego makes more double(or, in this case, triple) decker buses in the future.

"LegoAdventures","2011-01-25T18:32:25.503Z","Knight Bus","What a Stupendous set!. This is a Wonderful remake of the Purple Knight Bus from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span>, and I have to say Lego really did this set Justice because it looks Fantastic. <br>Released in 2004 to Coincide with the Blockbuster release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, </span>it contains 242 Pieces, 2 Mini-figures, The Knight Bus, The Grim and a few elements resembling the Street. I managed to get this set from <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bricklink.com</span> in a New Sealed Box in Excellent Condition for $80 AUD, and i can strongly say do not surpass the opportunity to get this set. <br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions:</h4><br>The Box is 28.5cm Long, 28.5cm Tall and 7cm Thick. It consists of the Usual offerings and features found on a Box like the front Illustration of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Knight Bus </span>and the Red Lego Insignia. Around the sides, back and small part of the front of the Box is covered in the colour Blue. On the back of the Box there is an Illustration of all the Prisoner of Azkaban sets (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apart from the Exclusive 10132 Motorized Hogwarts Express</span>), however they are all Trans-White and see through. The only see that isn't see through is the Knight Bus and it is in colour. This is a feature found on all the Prisoner of Azkaban sets. There is an Alternative Model of the set which you can download from LEGO.com, however I don't think the Link is there anymore. There is also numerous images off other angles of the set. And then there is the Future References, Trademarks, Licensed Agreements, Trademarks and where the Components are made, for this particular set the Components are made in Denmark and the Czech Republic (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Pronounced Check Republic if you didn't already know hehe</span>) That's what I love about Lego is that it's Quality European Manufactured. <br>&nbsp; Inside the Box there is 3 Plastic Bags numbered 1-3, so the Building Experience will be much easier, and more organized considering the pieces you need for that particular step is in the appropriate bag. There is also the 33 Page Instruction Booklet, 40 if you include the Illustrations at the back. <br><br><h4>Mini-figs:</h4><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Stanley Shunpike </span><span style=""font-style: italic;"">more commonly known as <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Stan</span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""> Shunpike</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> the Knight Bus conductor</span><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">: </span>Stan features a Purple Conductor Hat, Simple, Calm Black Sparkling eyes. He also features slightly raised Black eyebrows and a funny sort of smiling mouth. He also has Orange Hair coming down both sides of his face. His Torso is very detailed. It features a Purple Conductor Uniform Jacket which is slightly opened an has a White work T-Shirt underneath with a small white Collar and a Purple Tie. He has a large Black outlined Collar on his Conductor Jacket which features 2 Sliver Buttons at the very end of the Collar. He has 1 Red line on both sides of his Conductor Jacket. On one side of the Left side of the Jacket he has a large White Oval resembling some sort of Badge. On both sides of the Jacket he also has 2 Diagonal Red lines resembling pockets. He also has a Black Rope going down his Jacket that stops at a Silver Square with a Circle in the middle that has 5 Circles in it, and a Black Wind-up handle on the side of it which all resembles the Ticket Machine which I though was incredible detail. His right side of his Conductor Jacket is a bit messy almost like he always has to open that side up so he can use the Ticket Mechanism or to get things out of his Jacket from that side. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Harry James Potter: </span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>Harry features his usual Messy Black Hair, Sparkling Brave Black eyes, Red Scar and Circular Glasses with Simple smile.<span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span></span></span></span> </span></span>His Torso features <span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></span>features a Opened Blue Jacket with an opened Collar and Pockets on either side.

Last of all you place numerous Black Tile pieces for the Roof. The Roof has an attachment at the back for another Black Knight Bus sign writing in White, and numerous Purple sloped Roof pieces. <br><br><h4>Overall:</h4><br>Overall this is a Wonderful set.
