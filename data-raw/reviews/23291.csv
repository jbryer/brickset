"connor_g","2014-02-25T01:03:33.367Z","Even more amazing than it looks","<p>I&#39;ve gotten back into LEGO as an adult, but I don&#39;t have a ton of sets yet, so when I buy a set I want to make it count. My last &quot;large&quot; purchase was <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9397-1/Logging-Truck"">9397 Logging Truck</a>, which took me about seven hours to build. Since the Sea Cow was rated for two years younger in age and was not Technic, it would take more like three to four hours. Oh boy was I wrong. I neglected to notice that the Sea Cow has over twice as many pieces as the Logging Truck. All in all this set took me about eleven hours to build, although I was partly slowed down because I was filming <a href=""https://vimeo.com/87445741"">this stop-motion video</a> as I went.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set has the largest LEGO instruction manual I&#39;ve ever encountered. The pages are as large as any manual I&#39;ve seen, but instead of the typical staple-bound booklet, the manual for the Sea Cow is about half an inch thick and features a solid spine. I did have some trouble with certain colors and shades of pieces looking very similar in the instructions. Everything seemed to be printed a shade darker than I would have expected, leading me to sometimes mistake light grey for dark grey, or mistake dark grey or dark brown for black. And although the &quot;silver&quot; and &quot;gold&quot; colors are not well represented in the printed instructions, they&#39;ve helpfully marked each of those pieces with a sparkle to help identify them. Without that sparkle, I would have easily mistaken gold pieces for orange on multiple occasions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box, unlike any other LEGO box I&#39;ve seen, has a tab on the flap so you can close the box again after it&#39;s been opened. It&#39;s a nice touch although I&#39;m not sure what utility it actually provides since it seems unlikely that you&#39;ll reuse the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces were bagged into nine sets of numbered bags, some numbers with up to three bags of pieces. This set has a&nbsp;<em>ton</em>&nbsp;of pieces--more than 2,700--which shouldn&#39;t be taken lightly. For as large as the set is, most of its size comes from a small handful of large pieces; the bulk of the pieces are very small detail pieces. You&#39;ll definitely want a clean environment to pour the pieces out or you&#39;ll risk losing some. And there are a lot of rare or specialized pieces too, some of which don&#39;t come with any spares, so be careful.&nbsp;Even if you only open the bags when they&#39;re specified in the instructions, you&#39;ll end up with tens of&nbsp;1x1&nbsp;round plates, for instance, but also a lot of individual small pieces that can easily get hidden under other, larger pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>If you enjoyed The LEGO Movie, then this set will make you happy in terms of the included characters. There are standard minifigs of Emmet, Wildstyle, Vitruvius, and Benny (Benny in particular isn&#39;t available in any other set so far, to my knowledge). It also includes Queasy Unikitty and MetalBeard. MetalBeard is smaller and less detailed than he is in the movie or in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70807-1/MetalBeard-s-Duel"">this set</a>, but it&#39;s still a very cool character model that&#39;s entirely poseable and able to stand freely.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I&#39;ve mentioned, this is a very detailed model with a lot of pieces. But most sections are very modularized so that you can build one chunk of the ship and then add it on to the main hull when it&#39;s done. For the most part the build is straightforward, although there were a few sections where two very similar pieces (for instance, one with peg holes and one without) were used near each other and if you use the wrong one without noticing you might end up with too few later on. But in general, as long as you&#39;re careful and pay attention to the instructions, nothing should prove to be terribly difficult. It&#39;s just time consuming as there are a lot of small pieces to put together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a&nbsp;<em>big</em>&nbsp;model. I can tell you that it&#39;s 24&quot; tall and 21&quot; long, but until you see it in front of you on a table towering over everything around it you won&#39;t be able to fully appreciate how big that is. Of course, a lot of that size is the central mast and bowsprit, but the sails do add an appreciable amount of size to the model. Even if you were to remove the masts, the ship itself is quite tall, probably around 16&quot; tall.</p>

<p>For as much detail as there is on the outside, there&#39;s just as much on the inside, and since the build is modular, most of the ship is designed to be opened up so you can see inside. There are two rooms in the main section in the back of the boat, and an open space at the bottom of the hull featuring six working cannons. When I first saw them I was reminded of the LEGO cannons from sets when I was a kid, but it turns out the cannons since then have become springloaded and can actually fire &quot;canonballs&quot; (1x1 round bricks) quite far--I was able to launch one six feet across the room before it hit a wall. Unfortunately, their placement in the bottom of the boat makes it very difficult to actually reach the firing mechanism. At least, that was my experience, but maybe a child with smaller hands would have an easier time of it.</p>

<p>The set also includes the double-decker couch and two Micromanagers, one of which is capable of &quot;firing&quot; a net. I had my doubts that this would actually work, but when I&#39;ve tried it so far, it actually seems to work surprisingly well, in terms of the ability for the net to actually open and spread out over a target. Aiming it is a whole other matter, though. Needless to say, this model has a lot of playing potential.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I didn&#39;t really know what I was getting myself into when I bought this. Despite the high price tag it ended up being a bit of an impulse purchase, and it&#39;s the only really large non-Technic set I&#39;ve bought... well, ever. I&#39;ve mostly built Technic sets since I re-discovered LEGO as an adult because I assumed that they would be more interesting for older builders. I don&#39;t know if this set is representative of the level of detail included in The LEGO Movie or if LEGO just has a lot of new building styles from when I played with them as a kid, but this was far more intricate than I expected, and provided a different type of challenge. While its cost may keep it out of most kids&#39; hands, I&#39;d highly recommend this set to fans of The LEGO Movie or anyone looking for a really large, interesting build.</p>

"merman","2014-03-02T14:27:02.64Z","Words are not enough to describe the sheer awesomeness of this set!","<p>When I first saw this set on blurry prelim pics I wasn&#39;t sure. I didn&#39;t have thing for pirates. I liked the ship in the Lego Movie, but this felt like a scaled and downgraded version of the brick-built ship in the film. And Metalbeard was a lot smaller. This changed when I saw better pictures and the Designers video. I had just posted a review of 71006 The Simpsons House and stated that this was my most expensive set to date. Two weeks later I&nbsp; bought Metalbeard&#39;s Sea Cow, which was even more expensive. Don&#39;t doubt about this set if you can afford it. It is utterly cool, humongous and simply amazing! Everything about this ship is Awesome!</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
It comes in a big box the size of 10224 Town Hall. The box is not only very inviting, but can easily be flat-foldable, a very positive direction that was started with the exclusive sets. The box doesn&#39;t contain much Billund O2 and is stuffed with lots of bags, divided into 9 groups, the 5 hull pieces and a 32 Technic axle, and comes with a cardboard protected instruction book and small sticker sheet. The instructions are not divided into several booklets but come in one big novel. A very nice idea, which gives you the impression you are building something epic.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
This set contains over 2700 pieces and over 500 different parts. The amount of different parts is an indication of the price value. Only some round plates come in over 100 pieces. The parts on the box look a little bit more shiny than the real thing. This is an issue that comes with more sets. Lego is known for photoshopping the parts. I would have loved the idea if the pearl gold and silver parts would be metallic. I even ordered the silver parts on Bricklink in metallic. Metallic gold is very rare and not available for all parts. Also, the new baby bows come in pearl silver and have a strange marking on them. Fortunately, you only get 4 of those.</p>

<p>Besides this minor issue, the parts pack is amazing. It contains lots of boat pieces, masts and lots of unique pieces that only come in a single piece. This indicated the designers had the liberty of making this an amazing set! You also get 6 (!) pearl dark grey cannons and some amazing figs!<br />
<br />
The amount of detail for this set is just amazing. It contains many ornaments and bizarre decorations. The amount of stickers is acceptable. I really love the whimsical look of this ship.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
So far, this is the only set that contains Benny the classic spaceman. The helmet is a new mold and is not really broken, just off-set. The set also contains Vitruvius, Benny and Wyldstyle. Besides the figs, it also contains two microfigs unique for this set: the greenish Queasy (Seasick) Kitty and a mini Metalbeard. The smaller Metalbeard is an amazing build that efficiently makes use of several pieces to mimic the cannons and shark on his head and the new joint pieces that were introduced in the recent Chima sets. Despite it has the same parts used for his head and beard as his big brother, the minibuild is very well in proportion. You can also place mini-Beard on top of the ship.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong><br />
The build starts with several mini builds, including mini-Beard, the famous doubledecker couch and a small and medium Micromanager. The small manager has an effective way of shooting a net and the medium Micro has a foldable radar dish.<br />
<br />
I decided to open all bags at once, making the build more of a challenge. I liked it that way, but halfway I decided to sort the pieces on color, because I was looking for certain parts forever. The build of the ship is sort of modular. You start with the bottom of the ships also containing the cannons. Then you build the sides and the deck, followed by the lower parts of the cabin that has opening doors. Then you start building the upper part of the cabin that has a removable ceiling. You finish by building the steampunk engines, rotors and the amazing sails that consists of Technic panels. A nice choice and more durable than the cloth sails of other ships.<br />
<br />
<strong>The completed model</strong><br />
I was amazed that the ship got higher and higher. The boat part initially is rather stubby, but the final result is well balanced and I love the exaggerated look of the ship. Since my build, that took over 10 hours, I could not stop looking at this set, that is just utterly amazing!</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
Do I really need to add anything to the above? This is such an amazing set and is really GIGANTIC! So go get this &#39;Sea Cow! Sea Cow! SEA COW!&#39;</p>

<p>It is stuffed with tons of bags!I mean,seriously,we could have combined the sails in one big bag instead of 2-3 separate bags just for sails.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Since there were so many small parts,it took me quite a while to build......</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>?I decided to skip all the minifigs except for MetalBeard,which looks totally AWESOME with his design.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very complicated,although took me 4 hours to build.A tip on building is when you open up the bags,put all the big parts in one tray and the smaller parts in another tray.It was a very efficient technique which allowed me to complete it in relatively quick time.</p>

<p>I liked the &quot;steampunk&quot; design of the ship,which is a sharp contrast to other LEGO&trade; ships.I would even bet that this is the first steampunk ship that LEGO has even released!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Hull shape was actually pretty small,so I was a bit unhappy at the size,considering with all the detail only to have such a small hull shape.</p>

<p>Apart from that,This was really fun to play with.I loved the ship! It keeps getting higher and higher.You know,at some point LEGO&trade; will probably make a LEGO that stretches to the stars.....</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think that this is a really good set.The interior is meticulously detailed ,it was top-heavy,and also very cool. This is definetly recommended for other AFOLS!</p>

"Iamblichus","2016-01-08T17:57:54.84Z","Sure to become a classic!","<p>No picture can convey the majesty of seeing this set fully built in person. How could weak and fruitless words ever sum it up? It is the zenith of the imaginative minds at Lego, a stupefying masterpiece, the pinnacle of glory and awesomeness.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Having built similarly sized sets (in terms of pieces) before, I was kind of surprised to find that the instruction booklet is a whopping 290 pages long--enough to put one in mind of reading the Bible. One almost expects to open it and see phrases such as &quot;And lo placeth the brown 1x1 brick unto the red 4x1 brick and it will be good.&quot; But don&#39;t worry. There&#39;s none of that.</p>

<p>The reason the booklet is that long is because each step generally only requires placing under 10 bricks. This is unlike the similarly sized sets in the modular buildings series which sometimes require upwards of 30 bricks per step. Thus the instructions generally feel much easier to follow. I would rate this set&#39;s difficulty 3 or 4/5 which, along with the theme of the set, makes it ideal for building with your young one.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Many of the 2700ish parts in this set are small and if you attempt to tackle this build in one sitting (as I did) you might leave with your fingers feeling rather raw (again, as I did). This set features a number of less common pieces in addition to some which I think may be bespoke to this set (don&#39;t quote me on that). My favorite pieces in the whole set are the two halves of the globe in the captain&#39;s quarters--I have never seen a Lego globe before--and the ship-in-a-bottle piece, also in the captain&#39;s quarters. No doubt these will add value to the set as time goes on. Even though there aren&#39;t many minifigures in this set, I would without question rate the parts a 5/5.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Strictly speaking there are only four minifigures, which is certainly not much for a set originally sold for $249.99. However, in addition to these you get a Metalbeard figure, a sea-sick Princess Unikitty, and two evil drones. Personally, I think this makes up for it. But mind that I&#39;m the kind of person who has always been more interested in the build than the minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Expect this build to take you about nine to ten hours. The build is replete with variety which keeps it from feeling boring or failing to hold your attention and, as said before, the instructions are relatively easy to follow keeping it from ever feeling frustrating. There are a few pieces that require stickers to be placed which might be a bit triggering for those who suffer from OCD. I rate the build a 5/5.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think you&#39;ll find that this set is only fit for display purposes. This is not a very playable Lego set. It is far more delicate than most other large Lego sets I have built. There are a number of pieces that can easily be broken off and lost, especially when removing parts in order to access the interiors of the ship. On that basis, I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as a gift to a child or young teenager. I rate the playability a 3/5.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion of this set is 5/5. Several factors make this set above and beyond other sets in my opinion. These include its uniqueness of style, rarity of parts, and its movie origins. If you want this set then I think you should buy it sooner rather than later. I expect in several years they will be few and far between and their demand will surge when the next Lego movie comes out.</p>
