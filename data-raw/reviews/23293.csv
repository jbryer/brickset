<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong> - Typical City themed box, not much to say about it. Instructions did not come with a cardboard backing so one of the booklets was badly creased. This forced me to place a weight on the corner of the page so it would stay open for reading. Hopefully the cardboard-packed instructions will trickle down to mid-sized sets soon.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong> - Lots of nice parts here, Numerous large plates and bricks are used to make up the structure in black, tan, and dark gray. Including the 1x12 tan bricks which appear only in this set new for 2014. The Plate 1X8 With Rail in red is also new and currently exclusive to this set. Other noteable new parts are some new and rare yellow parts on the taxi cab, the dark gray curved parts that create the overhang, and the med. azure bicycle is welcome as well.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong> - Nice selection here. Three citizens, one of which drives the cab, alongside a chef and a train conductor.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build </strong>- The build is broken up into several phases: The taxi and assorted small sections like the bike rack, The foundation, and finishing with the station itself.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong> - The station has a unique, modern look to it that differs quite a bit from past stations. The exposed framework of the platform supports reminds me of several smaller train stations I have visited in Western Europe which was a big draw for me. The detailing is top notch for a set of this size. The snack bar is well stocked and the Lego Shop is a welcome replacement to a typical newstand one would find in the real world. The ATM along with the route maps and schedule boards suspended overhead are also excellent. Sticker haters beware, there are quite a few in this set. I applied all of them as they add a lot of detail and realism that would be severely lacking otherwise. Biggest complaint is how the red striping along the top of the station jumps up a plate when crossing the black plates holding the signs above the platform. It takes away a bit from what is otherwise a smartly styled set.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong> - I was really pleased with this set and surprised at the high level of detailing inside and out. A good amount of play features such as the taxi, the shops, and the bicycle are included for a set of this size. I was able to pull the Horizon Express advanced model into the station no problem and it looked good paired with it. (In case you are wondering if it would fit under the overhang.) Styling is always going to be a personal choice but I feel this train station strikes a great balance between realism and also utilizing a fun range of color to avoid a boring build or look. Recommended.</h3>

"xboxtravis7992","2015-10-01T21:13:47.317Z","All Aboard!","<p>Lego has had a long history of train stations, from simple platforms to detailed facades. 60050-1 is the newest in this tradition, and is the first Lego train station I have purchased. How does it hold out?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Of course train fans will be happy to get more rails for their layout. This set though doesn&#39;t seem to have a lot of exclusive parts, the majority seem to be stuff commonly seen in a Lego city. Of course that teal bike is an exception, who can say no to a teal bike?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>These are your generic Lego City figures, they all look great but this is not going to bring about the collecting fandom such as a licensed figure would. But that is also what makes this set fun, generic human beings living their normal life in a normal situation. I would say that is a common flaw of many&nbsp;sets that they lack such &quot;normal&quot; locations, for example: how is Spider Man supposed to save New York if all of his sets consist of helicopters and spider-trikes? What city are the police supposed to save, if their entire city consists of police minifigures and crooks?&nbsp;Sets such as 60050-1 provide great world building, and as such I am more than happy to receive&nbsp;a large group of generic minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple. It is not a modular building of course! The real fun part is watching the little rooms come together though, and although it is all basic it is very very fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>So first to the downside of this thing... it is fragile! While the main building is very sturdy, the tracks and the awning come of very very easy. Fortunately the repairs are easy too, but I wish that Lego had come up with a sturdier build than what we have. A definite damper on playability.</p>

<p>The other&nbsp;downside is if the purchaser doesn&#39;t own any Lego trains... Yes this model only works good if the owner is willing to purchase up a fleet of Lego trains to visit the station.</p>

<p>On the bright side though is the brilliance of many parts of this model. A small automatic ticket booth is provided. The taxi cab is a fun little add on, it looks great in the streets of a Lego City (for example my taxi cab from this set is currently displayed near my modular buildings in a street scene.) The little food vender is another great detail.</p>

<p>The track has enough clearance that both official Lego trains and large MOCs can easily pass through the station. My Emerald Night, Maersk&nbsp;train (without the double stacked containers), and Horizon Express (with the pantograph slightly lowered)&nbsp;all pass through this station just fine without any problems.</p>

<p>But the real highlight of this set is the mini Lego store! It is in a small room, with a cashier&#39;s desk and a shelf with blue tiles with stickers representing Lego sets. If we think to much about this we might start to wonder just &quot;why&quot; minifigures play with little Lego sets, and then we might start to think a bit to much that the minifigures in the minifigure&#39;s&nbsp;Lego sets might be playing with their own nano-Lego sets... but such speculation is besides the point. This is a brilliant detail.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set a lot, but the fragile parts bug me to no end. At least I am happy now that my Horizon Express and Emerald Night now have a station to truly call &quot;home.&quot; And that mini Lego store, I can go on about that all day. This is a brilliant set, and is a great addition to a Lego train collection, but prospective purchasers should be aware of the fragile build before hand. All in all, a fun addition to my Lego city.</p>

<p>Nice sized box, fairly full ... I wish TLG would take better care of the instructions on set this size!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Very nice mix of parts here, nothing new but some welcome parts from odd places ie the windscreens from the F 40.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Again nothing new but familiar faces from other sets, my favorite is the chef making wieners!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As my title states, I did not build this set but allowed my seven year old grandson that pleasure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The first day of the build he grew impatient with the taxi build and gave up, so we put it away for a couple of days.</p>

<p>Last evening he wanted something to do as it was raining outside. I suggested we take another look at the train station set. He agreed. This time, he took a&nbsp;careful look at the instruction book, discovered his mistakes and rebuilt the taxi...</p>

<p>&nbsp;After a few&nbsp;minutes play with it, he&nbsp;was eager to tackle the station build. It took him several minutes to grasp the first few steps. However, &nbsp;when he did figure out that&nbsp;he was building&nbsp;the foundation, he&nbsp;was happy to see the progress.</p>

<p>He did have to go back a couple of times to discover mistakes in placement of parts that did not show up until the platform plates were ready to go in place.</p>

<p>After those setbacks he was ready to proceed. The rest of the build went forth smoothly.</p>

<p>In the end he was very proud to say he did it himself... as he did.with the blue cargo train build except the powerfunctions&nbsp;build of the locomotive.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The station looks nice as built,&nbsp;but I could not resist moving the black signage plates to the ends of the building for better symmetry and balance. This also gives a better overview of the snack bar&nbsp;signage and better suits red/black colors on the top with no break in the red from the overhead view, IMHO! I will go back and provide a roof for the platform to keep the passengers dry and shelter them from the sun as they wait! The taxi and bike are a big hit with Luke. We are already planning a taxi stand at the left end of the platform (train side) and maybe a &nbsp;bike rental/storage kiosk... As you can see this set&nbsp;has sparked some thought from both of us.</p>

<p>I will admit that we did enlist Luke&#39;s twentysomething year old uncle for the stickers (which I detest, come on Lego, if Juniors sets can get printed, why not here!) But oh well!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would rate this set a win for the youngster and a great starting place for others.</p>

<p>Recommend****</p>
