"Skut","2015-03-12T05:45:18.57Z","Lego's best high speed train for years","<p><font face=""Rockwell"">Okay, okay, the full review headline should have been &quot;Lego&#39;s best high speed train (apart from the 10233 TGV - oops, Horizon Express) for years&quot;, but that would have been a bit wordy.</font></p>

<p>This is Lego&#39;s best &quot;standard range&quot; high speed train for at least a decade.&nbsp; It is superior to 7897 and 7938 on all counts: looks, construction and playability.&nbsp; Yes it is true that the nose/tail cones are slightly juniorised, but at least they are moulded correctly - unlike 7897 -&nbsp;and create the effect of a superfast train, unlike 7938 - whose &quot;brick built&quot; ends make it look like a bit of an &quot;stopping at all stations&quot; suburban clunker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am really pleased to see that Lego has continued with the tradition of including a platform and other accessories (pedestrian level crossing) as well as the train.&nbsp; This goes back over three decades now - to 7740 - and really increases playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is a tad repetitive given the similarities between the front and rear driving cars, but this is offset by the parts availability - Lego has cleverly designed this set so that if you buy two copies of this set then you have pretty much all the parts you need to build a single train with three middle coaches as well as the front and rear driving cars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Power Functions add to the fun but also the price - given the demise of the 9V system and the move to cheaper all-plastic track, I think there&#39;s lots of potential for Lego to hit lower price points with unpowered (push along) trains, but the penny doesn&#39;t seem to have dropped yet.&nbsp; So (for now at least)&nbsp;it&#39;s Power Functions all the way.</p>

<p>Overall, this set&#39;s a winner.&nbsp;</p>

"FlagsNZ","2015-10-15T08:36:18.42Z","High-speed passenger train that only works at slow speeds","<p>This week I have reviewed my LEGO train sets as I had them all&nbsp;built up over the weekend when my seven year old nephew was visiting from Australia.</p>

<p>I have already reviewed <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49344"">60052 Cargo Train</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49340"">10233 Horizon Express</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49336"">7939 Cargo Train</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49334"">10219 Maersk Train</a>.</p>

<p>This is my last review in the train series and I have left 60051 High-Speed Passenger Train until the end as it is my least favourite LEGO train in my collection.</p>

<p>Read on to see why I have formed this opinion.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a large box with an image on the front showing the high-speed passenger train as well as the rail crossing and small train station.&nbsp;There is also an inventory of the track sections and a suggested track layout.</p>

<p>The rear of the box has several close up views of the key components of this set showing the play features. There are some images of the companion&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/subtheme-Trains/year-2014"">City train sets released in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The instructions come in four booklets:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Book 1 with bag 1 makes the rail crossing and small train station.</li>
	<li>Book 2 with bags 2 and 3 makes the&nbsp;engine.</li>
	<li>Book 3 with bags 4 and 5 makes the central carriage.</li>
	<li>Book 4 with bags 6 and 7 makes the rear &quot;engine.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a large sticker sheet with this set which is protected by a cardboard insert in the instruction bag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>To give this set the high-speed look it comes with a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6078201"">large nose cone</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6078204"">windscreen</a> pieces which are unique to this set. I do not like these large moulded parts and would prefer a brick built solution however I realise that this is a City set aimed at children aged between 6 and 12 years old.</p>

<p>The nose cone sits forward of the front bogie and sweeps wide of the track on curves.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This sets comes with three minifigures. A train driver in the blue LEGO&nbsp;train livery, a business woman in a red jacket with ID card holding a brief case and a student with a satchel and red bicycle.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6032070"">red female torso</a> is unique to this set while the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6055507"">light blue torso</a> has been seen in five sets since 2014.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5811/21465598893_6d76dfc393_o.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 393px;"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As mentioned in all my reviews of the train sets, it is easy to build this set at your own pace as the build experience can be broken into several discrete stages.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set comes with a basic rail crossing with warning lights.</p>

<p>It also has a small train station with a train signage.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5831/22060557966_ce974bfb7f_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The set comes with&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4279717"">16 curved tracks</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4279714"">four straight tracks</a>. The limited amount of track means that the potential track layouts is confined to a few designs.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with this set is the tendency for the train to lose control on curved tracks when being driven at high speed. The engine is light weight when compared to the more robust cargo train engines. This light weight feature makes the train derail when being run at fast speeds.</p>

<p>This tendency&nbsp;to derail&nbsp;makes this a&nbsp;high-speed passenger train that can only operate safely at slow speeds. At one stage during the play, one of the trains careened of the track and flew down some stairs and landed by&nbsp;the front&nbsp;porch which caused the pin to shear&nbsp;off one of the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6086730"">bogie plates</a>. Fortunately I had a spare bogie plate from the brick built bogies of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Advanced-Models/subtheme-Trains"">Creator Expert trains</a>.</p>

<p>The problem was solved by blocking off the handrails on our stairs and slowing down the trains.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For me, this set has a mixed bag of responses. The small train station and rail crossing adds play features to a larger train network.</p>

<p>As I have two 60051 High-Speed Passenger Trains means that I have two rail crossings and two small stations.</p>

<p>Having rail crossings allows the cars and taxis to gain access to <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60050-1/Train-Station"">train stations</a>&nbsp;and the small rural train stations of this set allows for passengers to wait for trains and embark when they arrive.</p>

<p>There is a disappointingly small amount of track with this set which limits track layout designs. This set is therefore not as self-contained as the other City train sets that I have reviewed.</p>

<p>The train derails far too easily and this challenges its high-speed status.</p>

<p>What I have not commented on is the ease in which the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8879-1/IR-Speed-Remote-Control"">IR Speed Remote Controls</a>&nbsp;with their&nbsp;four dual-channels can be used to control a selection of trains. My nephew and I had seven trains operating&nbsp;from four remotes which had two 1x2 colour coded tiles on the four studs on the controls to identify which train they operated.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/762/22219600141_170f69607b_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The colours represent the trains which were controlled. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4164025"">1x2 Bright Yellow Green tile</a> controlled the second 60051 High-Speed Passenger Train.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can see that the orange tags on each controller is on a different IR channel.</p>

<p>Lewis and I took over the house for the weekend and we had a wonderful time terrorising the cats. We had three separate&nbsp;track loops running around the lounge and hallway with a viaduct running through our coffee table.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/782/22220543342_ea41ef5c90_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I was fortunate to receive two of the sets earlier in the year which were significantly discounted. One of these sets was given to Lewis who is now terrorising my sister in Australia.</p>

<p>This LEGO train is still available in stores. I hope I have not put you off purchasing this set. There is still time to pick one up before it is retired.</p>

"CherryRose","2015-10-10T04:12:50.377Z","Fast and Furious, even if Flawed. ","<p>One thing I&#39;ve seemed to notice about train sets with Lego is that I feel they&#39;ve been getting consistently less popular as time went on. What is it about them? Maybe it&#39;s just hard to get a really strong build out of something so smooth? Maybe the novelty of going in loops is just wearing off? Whatever the reason, is this train a worthy addition to a collection? I guess we&#39;ll find out...</p>

<h3>As a Playset</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve played with any kind of train set as a kid, Thomas and the like, it&#39;s obvious how this set plays out. There&#39;s a full set of power functions included, and a remote to control it all. The remote is able to control up to 2 trains at 7 speeds with the simple turn of a dial, which the IR receiver will detect it&#39;s signal, transferred to the battery box (with a really clever on/off switch),then powering the frontmost bogie to move, forward or back in a continuous loop. It works effectively even if it renders the front car useless, although as Jang pointed out, there&#39;s a flaw in the back section where at high speeds, the tiles will end up catching in the trailer and it will derail, but I just found a better solution to cover up the (uncalled for) holes in the floor with a 2x2 plate. Of course $150 dollars for a circle is a novelty that wears off quickly, so expect your kid to ask for more track in the near future.</p>

<p>In order to actually use this set, you get 3 minifigures, a conductor and 2 passengers, male and female, and are given a comically small platform to wait on, getting on awkwardly one car at a time, with or without a bike, not even going through doors which are entirely absent to then sit on seats with said hazardous holes to the side in the hope that they&#39;ll get to a destination... somewhere. Maybe the sold-seperately Train Station? I have no idea, honestly.</p>

<h3>As a Building Experience</h3>

<p>As this is a City set, you can&#39;t expect a challenging build from it, as train is made up entirely of well, train parts. It&#39;s not very different from similar sets released in the past outside of added realism, and much of the build are simple, but effective, add bricks and windows on the chases, throw in a few stickers and it&#39;s pretty much done. Aside fro being cleverly designed so that you can build 2 extra middle cars if you decide to buy multiples, and how the, also sold-seperately, lights can be intergrated, what you see is what you get.</p>

<h3>As a Parts Pack</h3>

<p>Given that this set&#39;s supposed to be incredibly smooth, sleek and long, having an entirely brick-built solution would&#39;ve been virtually impossible, and with that a lot of specialized pieces had to be made for the set. Some of them have been around for a while-lots of track, bogies with metal axles, 3 very large chases--although more notoriously is the huge, heavily curved front section w/ windscreen insert that gives it it&#39;s signature shape. But like I said, if it were to use a brick-built solution there would be far less room to play with it and it wouldn&#39;t look nearly as aerodynamic. Despite hat, there&#39;s still a surprising number of useful elements, over 60 trans-black window panels are included, as well as loads of white bricks and general, multi-colored miscellany.</p>

<h3>As a Display Model</h3>

<p>Even putting that all aside, I think there&#39;s one big reason to buy this set: it looks great. Possibly one of the best-looking trains Lego&#39;s produced, period. Resembling a super-fast and powerful yet comfortable and minimal bullet train, the train feels like it knows what it&#39;s doing and does it really well. It just yells that it wants to get everywhere in your city, it knows that it wants to get there as quickly as possible, yet it still tells you it&#39;s clean efficient. Even the grey-red-and-white color scheme tricks you into that. Maybe it&#39;s missing some essentials, like the doors and an up-to-code floor, but as you gaze at it for hours going across a layout, it&#39;s quite impressive and eye-catching.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you really like the look of this set, I&#39;d go ahead and pick it up, and it would be a very welcome addition to a city, but aside from that... yeah, there isn&#39;t much to it that hasn&#39;t been in trains past, and along with it&#39;s numerous problems and somewhat thin novelty, it might not be the set for you.</p>

"CrescentSky","2015-11-08T02:49:04.65Z","Another Passenger train","<p>In the past year or so we got another batch of&nbsp;trains, and a third with 60098 Heavy-Haul Train. I never liked the look of the last passenger train (7938), as I found it too blocky. This set, however, looks sleek and modern, and the addition of the crossing is very much appreciated.&nbsp;But it is not without its flaws, all being explained later.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a rather large and long box, perhaps too large. The four instruction booklets are just like all other city sets, basic and easy to follow. Not much else to say; just your regular city boxing and instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I know everybody complains about this set for multiple reasons, but one of the major reasons is the large canopy pieces used for the front of each engine, saying that it isn&#39;t very &quot;lego-y.&quot; The last passenger train didn&#39;t use any specialized molds. However, it looked very unfinished to me. I know that it is possible to make a good looking bullet train engine without large pieces (10233 Horizon Express is a great example), but it takes a plethora of small pieces to accomplish this, and therefore making the set very expensive. For a city set, it just doesn&#39;t work together. The only notable pieces are a 1x4x2&nbsp;clear panel and the many tinted or trans-black 1x2x2&nbsp;panels, which are useful for vehicle MOCs, and finally the level crossing pieces, which is one of the reasons I bought this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are only three minifigs in this set, which is acceptable, though it could use maybe four figures. You get one train engineer and two passengers. The engineer is nothing new; it has been used many times in the past decade or so. The passengers have some interesting torso pieces. The male passenger has a blue jacket which is good for making everyday city folk to populate a growing town. The female has a red press shirt, which is also useful for customization.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a good length but a bit repetitious. Most of the build is spent on the nearly identical train cars, but the train station&nbsp;is a nice small build. It took me about 45 minutes to finish the model, which is more complicated than it first appears. Not a bad build, but not very interesting.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model looks very nice, and is one of my favorite looking trains in recent years. My only complaint is the overhang the ends have when going around corners, but it is inevitable with the way it&#39;s designed.&nbsp;The station is a little small for me, but it can be easily expanded.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite looking great,&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth&nbsp;the price of $150.00 USD. The only reason I got this set was to have something running around my city, so if you aren&#39;t completely satisfied with this set then don&#39;t buy it. It is a good train, but I think it just costs too much. But if you want a modern passenger train to run around a larger layout, this set is perfect for that. If you&#39;re a fan of the set, get it; and if not, don&#39;t. It&#39;s as simple as that.</p>
",TRUE,4,4,4,4,2
"lentil","2017-01-03T18:29:54.953Z","Sleek, modern train that is fun to play with","<p>I bought this train as a Christmas present for my husband who likes trains but is not into LEGO (hoping to bring him over to my side...?), and it was overall a hit with him, our daughter, and her friends. It&#39;s not perfect imho, but I do think it has a lot of nice features and is my favorite of the LEGO trains available currently. This is my first LEGO train, so I&#39;m not able to compare it to earlier models.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The parts are separated into 7 bags, each with only a relatively small number of pieces. We did not have to go through our usual piece-sorting step, since there were so few pieces per bag and it was easy enough to find everything. The instructions were simple and used only a few pieces per step. A couple of 10-year olds actually did the majority of the build by themselves, really only needing help with some of the electronic items and stickers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are a ton of said stickers, which I hate as I can never get the $%!# things on straight! The oil/pneumatics stickers in particular should be placed directly over these little container bricks, but the container bricks are not placed at the time of sticker application so it&#39;s not clear until afterward where precisely they&#39;re supposed to go.... I of course managed to botch that royally. Wish they would use printed pieces for things like that instead.</p>

<h3>Design and Functionality</h3>

<p>We all really loved the sleek, modern look of this train. I actually think the curved, solid nose cones are perfect and completely necessary - they make the train work aesthetically. The simple color scheme is bright, bold and effective. This train looks snappy and efficient whipping around the tracks. I especially like the solid line of smoky windows and the aerodynamic shape of the noses. The first car contains the battery pack and has a small seat for the conductor at the front, while the second two cars contain rows of little red seats for passengers. There really aren&#39;t any interesting details to speak of inside.</p>

<p>We were also all quite impressed with the operation of the train. Again, this is our first lego train, so maybe the rest of you are all blase about this sort of thing, but the battery pack and remote work exceptionally well. The steering is sensitive and precise, and the train can get going really really fast! I love the slight humming noise it makes when operating - truly sounds like the high-pitched singing of a bullet train. Everyone was especially delighted with the stop feature - you can press a red button and the train will just stop on a dime which is kind of breathtaking. Overall it is a pleasure to operate. The remote itself has 8 channels, which as far as I understand means you can operate up to 8 trains with one remote! Definitely makes one hope that more attractive train models will be released in the future, so we can add a buddy or two...</p>

<p>There are only a few tracks which can basically form only a small circle. Additional track would be needed (from another train set, or sold separately) to really get the train going. As other reviewers have mentioned, the cars do fly off the tracks if you take a curve at higher speeds, so some skill in driving is required :-)</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The kids enjoyed playing with this for hours, so it clearly has demonstrated play appeal. The only thing they were critical of was the lack of access to the interior of the train. Bizarrely for a so-called &quot;passenger&quot; vehicle, there are no doors to the passenger cabins! The only way for anyone to actually get inside is for some weird giant to remove the roof (not particularly easy to do) and have them fly in through the ceiling... the 10-year olds protested loudly at the awkwardness of this. In the end their passengers just rode around on the roof instead, which is fortunately well-studded for good minifig grip.</p>

<p>The other thing limiting playability is the small number of minifigs (only 3). We quickly supplemented from our general collection to achieve a reasonable number of passengers.</p>

<p>There is only a very small station/waiting area, but this was enough for playable purposes. Obviously the intention is for you to dot buildings/parks/station/scenery around the tracks at your leisure.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The retail price tag seems steep to me, but it may be worth it considering the battery pack and remote are included, as well as a decent amount of starter track. If discounted (as mine was) it becomes potentially a great value.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: aesthetically pleasing train that is super fun to operate. Would make a great addition to any modern city layout. In fact, since it looks a bit like a monorail (of course I know it&#39;s not really), it may have to transport passengers to my Disney Castle as a monorail stand-in...</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: small number of tracks and minifigs, no doors/access to cabins, no substantial station. Everything but the lack of doors can be easily rectified by supplementing from your own collection.</p>

<p>Overall a great train!</p>
