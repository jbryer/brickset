"Mike_Marsh","2014-06-11T20:40:12.893Z","Cargo Train 2014","<p>I have several Lego train sets and three of them ate based on cargo trains. &nbsp;This particular set offers some new rolling stock and a different cargo crane to that of 7939. More USA style than European I like this set</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>instructions as usual are clear and show how to build the set in easy stages. &nbsp;The box is large and has some great ideas appertaining&nbsp;to the set!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are packaged well in numbered bags making it easy to build the various items. &nbsp;The numbers on the bags coincide with the numbered instruction booklets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The usual high standard of figures including a farmer for the longhorn cow!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Lego really know how to make instructions simple and if you follow the instructions you cannot go wrong. &nbsp;I spent about three hours putting the whole set together and enjoyed every minute.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a North American style locomotive and rolling stock. &nbsp;The cow depicts a longhorn animal typical of the USA. &nbsp;I like the style, and the rolling stock and believe this is the best version of the cargo train to date.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall a typical Lego creation, well thought out, great instructions and added to the vast array of locomotives I already own a great addition to my collection. &nbsp;Well done again Lego!</p>

"Tyler_James","2014-08-28T23:54:22.183Z","New Cargo Train","<p>I&#39;m always excited to see a new Lego train, and this train is sufficiently different from the most recent yellow cargo train to warrant picking up. But there are a lot of things with this set that really leave something to be desired, especially given the 200 USD price tag.?</p>

<p>The engine looks pretty good; I was happy to see a diesel locomotive and the return of the train doors. The design is somewhat reminiscent of the recent limited release red cargo train, but the interior or &quot;guts&quot; of the train are pretty bare bones. The panels on either side of the engine mask the battery box, which was clever enough, but otherwise the design is pretty basic. That&#39;s not to say it looks bad or out of place, but it is nowhere near as satisfying as any Lego train engine I&#39;ve put together before. I did like how easily this engine incorporated a designated button for activating power function. In that respect, this engine is probably more &quot;playable&quot; than any other RC cargo engine.</p>

<p>The train cars are new designs, and both of the larger cars use a pallet system that has a lot of play value. This is definitely the highlight of this set, and is better than some other cargo systems found before in Lego trains. I like seeing some consistency across different sets, though, and I&#39;m not sure if these pallets are the same size as what you will find in other cargo sets (planes, trucks, etc.) in the past few years. Regardless, they still can be easily transferred from train car to car, and then to the truck. I thought the wire spools were a neat idea, and a good way to add interest to the set without adding many parts, but I was pretty disappointed with the wheelbarrow pallet. I know its silly to expect to much realism for Lego, but the logistics nerd in me was cringing at the cost of shipping a single wheelbarrow this way!</p>

<p>The cattle car is a fun addition; it is a little smaller than the other cars and would have been improved with just one more animal. However, it kind of feels out of place, given that cattle would probably not be moving through the same intermodal yard that the rest of this cargo would travel through.</p>

<p>The two smaller vehicles are very good, especially compared to past vehicles that accompanied larger train sets. The forklift looks good and is fun to play with, and the truck works seamlessly with the pallet system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can probably see, the crane is a pretty bare-bones affair but it does add some functionality to the set. There is a chair and computer in the little office, but I was pretty unimpressed with the support structure to hold pallets. I doubt the market is there for it, but I would prefer a 60-70 USD standalone set that does a better job a similar crane and office building.</p>

<p>Minifigures are also a high point,the new train personnel look the part and the addition of a farmer was a nice, if not somewhat random, touch.</p>

<p>If you like Lego trains, I imagine you&#39;ll end up with this set regardless, but I feel that this is a weaker addition to the line compared to the past two cargo trains. The power functions, which I have been generally disappointed with when it comes to how well they can actually pull cargo (especially with the new magnet connectors) add a lot to the price and just aren&#39;t that fun for big train displays. So, I&#39;d keep a close eye on used sets or separated lots so you can either save some money or just get the engine, forklift, or truck.&nbsp;</p>

"no_skill","2016-04-08T03:13:40.8Z","Solid train (especially at a discount)","<p>&nbsp;I am a big fan of LEGO&nbsp;trains. However, the recent city trains have left me a little bit flat, until I found this one. &nbsp; This is my first LEGO&nbsp;train purchase in a very long time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i1027.photobucket.com/albums/y333/jmunder50/Public_Forums/IMG_1084_zpsbqzioyxw.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 300px;"" /></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;The box is huge. Too much so, but I guess with the retail price of $200 US, you need to make an impact on shelf space. The instructions, as others have stated, are super-simplistic. In all honesty, I think even children would find it more fun if some of the instruction steps were combined.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;The locomotive windshield piece is&nbsp;nice, and there are real train doors. &nbsp;I like the plates that comprise the&nbsp;rear aspect of the locomotive body. &nbsp;A full set of train- related&nbsp;Power Functions is included (requiring 9 AAA batteries for use).</p>

<p>The pillars&nbsp;that support the crane are single piece. Effective, but not terribly aesthetic. &nbsp; I would have preferred something different. Also, aside from a computer screen and gages&nbsp;in the loco cab, printed pieces are non existent. If you see it, it&#39;s a sticker.</p>

<p>Returning to the positives, the set comes with right AND left points, 20 pieces of curved track, and 8 straight! &nbsp; That&#39;s great! &nbsp;It does force the transfer station to be placed on the main-line oval, but allows for a short detour siding. &nbsp;It takes 4 additional pieces of straight track&nbsp;to move the transfer station off of the main oval to its own siding.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>&nbsp;The minifigures are great! Three men and one lady. All but one have a cap&nbsp;that enables accessory&nbsp;placement, such as a pair of headphones (two included with the set). The minifig printing and&nbsp;colors are &nbsp;excellent. In addition to the headphones, accessories include a garbage can, a dolly/hand truck, a &nbsp;water bucket with handle, and a crate.</p>

<p><img alt=""steer "" src=""http://i1027.photobucket.com/albums/y333/jmunder50/Public_Forums/d9232f29-51d2-4e97-8c8b-50f5c1c63e34_zpsynusadoq.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 177px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;The best minifigure of all is a Longhorn steer! It is really, really cool! Definitely a high point of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Most of the rolling stock&nbsp;is a very simplistic build with few pieces. &nbsp;Luckily, only the transfer station pillars and two office wall pieces seemed juniorized to me. &nbsp;Nice!</p>

<p>The locomotive is the exception. &nbsp;I found it fairly intricate with a smattering of advanced techniques, but nothing too revolutionary. &nbsp; The six-wide truck is a fun little build&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=""side by side"" src=""http://i1027.photobucket.com/albums/y333/jmunder50/Public_Forums/0cff7a26-e663-4101-80a1-2bb18f0945dc_zpskjaeyjvp.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 216px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;This was an ideal set to build with my son. While I was working on the locomotive, he tackled the transfer station and part of the rolling stock. We finish the rest together. It was perfect for the situation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;The locomotive is really well done. The colors are wonderful and there is enough detail to satisfy an&nbsp;AFOL&nbsp;without diminishing playability for the kids. &nbsp;Turning the battery pack&nbsp;on and off by pressing the center fan is really cute. &nbsp;The engineer can enter through train doors in combination with a trap-door roof.&nbsp;Access to the battery pack and infrared receiver is a breeze.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=""battery access"" src=""http://i1027.photobucket.com/albums/y333/jmunder50/Public_Forums/d3081f20-0c8f-4e7a-80d5-dd12cbd1ecaa_zpsp9fbe0ea.jpg"" style=""width: 350px; height: 209px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;As stated, the rolling stock &nbsp;is simple but effective. I must say, I love the cattle&nbsp;car! &nbsp;Sure, it might not be too realistic, but it is perfect for a Lego town!</p>

<p>In like fashion, the transfer station &nbsp;is simple (but not too simple) and effective. &nbsp;There is loads of playability&nbsp;right out of the box, effectively a whole train system in a single set.&nbsp;A truck and forklift are there&nbsp;for handling cargo within and around the transfer station. &nbsp; The rolling stock&nbsp;can be loaded and unloaded to an operator&#39;s&nbsp;content.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=""station"" src=""http://i1027.photobucket.com/albums/y333/jmunder50/Public_Forums/03c75a67-f3d9-4bf7-9420-f57fb1296bc1_zpskfaxwonn.jpg"" style=""width: 375px; height: 361px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;Marks off&nbsp;are the following: &nbsp;First, with a loaded battery pack the locomotive&#39;s center of gravity is so high that it derails on corners more easily than&nbsp;expected. &nbsp;Second, the couplers/bumpers tend to detach themselves fairly easily from the bogie assemblies, especially on the locomotive. &nbsp;Third, although constituting a minority of the set, the&nbsp;juniorized office walls and&nbsp;crane pillars could have been done better. &nbsp;Lastly, I am not a fan of stickers, but luckily&nbsp;SAMP&nbsp;is not a big issue here. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a very good set, essentially a whole train system in a single box. It can stand by itself for hours of fun, or be&nbsp;incorporated&nbsp;into&nbsp;an&nbsp;extended town. I think there is substance here for the&nbsp;AFOL&nbsp;as well as the&nbsp;KFOL. &nbsp;My&nbsp;annoyances with the set are easily overcome by the positives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Excepting perhaps the&nbsp;price.&nbsp;$200 USD is the biggest negative of the set. For me, it&#39;s hard to justify just about any LEGO&nbsp;purchase at that price. At a meaningful&nbsp;discount,&nbsp;I think it is very much worth acquiring. Get one while you can!</p>

"FlagsNZ","2015-10-14T08:51:10.573Z","This is the LEGO train set that started my path onto the LEGO train network","<p>Last weekend, my seven year old nephew was visiting from&nbsp;Australia and I made up all my LEGO train sets and laid out all the track.</p>

<p>I have already reviewed <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49334"">10219 Maersk Train</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49336"">7939 Cargo Train</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49340"">10233 Horizon Express</a>.</p>

<p>60052 Cargo Train was the set that started my journey into the LEGO train network.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a large box with an image on the front showing the entire train yard laid out as well as an inventory of the track sections and a suggested&nbsp;track layout.</p>

<p>The rear of the box has several close up views of the key components of this set showing the play features. There are some images of the companion&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/subtheme-Trains/year-2014"">City train sets released in 2014</a>.</p>

<p>The instructions come in six booklets:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Book 1 with bag 1 makes a green cargo truck.</li>
	<li>Book 2 with bags 2 and 3 makes the blue engine.</li>
	<li>Book 3 with bag 4 makes the livestock waggon&nbsp;with a longhorn cow and farmer.</li>
	<li>Book 4 with bag 5 makes the first flat car and two green cable drums.</li>
	<li>Book 5 with bag 6 makes the second flat car with an Octan&nbsp;tank, wheel barrow and forklift truck.</li>
	<li>Book 6 with bags 7 and 8 makes the gantry overhead crane and cargo office.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is a huge sticker sheet with this set which is protected by a cardboard insert in the instruction bag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The key colour of the engine is bright blue and there are some unique&nbsp;parts in this colour:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6072638"">Plate 6x16 with 26 knobs</a></li>
	<li><a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6072636"">Left door</a></li>
	<li><a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6072637"">Right door</a></li>
	<li><a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6071445"">Engine window</a></li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/716/21465598543_ea1ab22385_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four minifigures in this set and a longhorn cow. The set has a truck driver, a forklift driver, engine driver and a farmer with a bucket.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6076153"">olive green minifigure torsos</a>&nbsp;are unique to this set as is the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6032177"">dark green farmer&#39;s cap</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5818/21899815419_0d4230643f_c.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As the set is split into discrete&nbsp;modules it is easy to build at a pace that suits you.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The engine closely resembles an <a href=""http://www2.gcs.k12.in.us/bholt/Csx%202706%20gn.jpg"">American diesel locomotive</a>.</p>

<p>While it is similar to <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10219-1/Maersk-Train"">10219 Maersk Train</a>, it is six studs shorter.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4638959"">AAA Battery Box</a> can be switched&nbsp;on by pressing down on the middle <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4218868"">black disk</a>&nbsp;on top of the engine&nbsp;and the green LED can be seen which is a great improvement.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5779/22060556466_b61496c520_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The engine cab opens up allowing access to the driver.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/643/21465596083_4a0018c52f_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There is a livestock waggon&nbsp;for the longhorn cow. The cow has a trough to feed from and&nbsp;some bales of hay.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/746/22086737195_a212122a69_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The key play feature of this set is the yellow gantry overhead crane and cargo office. This differs from the gantry crane in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7939-1/Cargo-Train"">7939 Cargo Train</a> by being located on a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6004927"">base</a> connected to the tracks.</p>

<p>The five <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6072694"">yellow gantry pillars</a> are unique to this set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/711/22074233132_5fcf1561c1_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The green truck has a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6072605"">large green bonnet</a>&nbsp;unique to this set,&nbsp;while the red fork lift&nbsp;is made up with a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6031520"">large red section</a>. I am not a great fan of these large parts and would prefer a brick built solution.</p>

<p>There are a couple of red trestles&nbsp;under the crane to support the pallets that are discharged from the train. The fork lift can transfer the cargo to the truck.</p>

<p>The set comes with&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4279717"">20 curved tracks</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4279714"">eight straight tracks</a>, and a&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4516092"">left</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6085188"">right</a>&nbsp;set of points.</p>

<p>Compared with 7939 Cargo Train, this set has four curved tracks in lieu&nbsp;of the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4535745"">16 flexi-track</a>&nbsp;pieces in the earlier set. 16 flexi-tracks&nbsp;have the same length as four regular tracks and would have added some track layout diversity.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Like 7939 Cargo Train, this is a&nbsp;self-contained LEGO train set.</p>

<p>The engine is great and there is a great selection of rolling stock.</p>

<p>The cargo handling facility of the gantry crane and a truck with fork lift add playability and will&nbsp;compliment&nbsp;any existing train sets you may have</p>

<p>There is&nbsp;a good selection of track pieces but it could have done with some flexi-track sections.</p>

<p>This is a regular LEGO train that is still available in stores. Pick one up before it is retired.</p>

<p>HUGE&nbsp;box extremely&nbsp;inviting and all of the play features are listed on the back in pictures. Clear instructions no hidden tricks and labelled bags.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>i have no idea why lego&nbsp;even bother putting &#39;6-12&#39; on their boxes. why can&#39;t they just put 6+? apart from that this is the best lego set that i hae ever got.&nbsp;</p>

"ultimatelegofanUK","2015-04-12T09:46:21.09Z","Partly Awesome, Cargo Train","<p>This was one of the best LEGO&trade; sets I ever got!It was very different from the 60051 train set,which was more streamlined and a more futuristic-looking view,and from the 7939-1 train,which bore a similarity to this set,but more bulky in the front.As always,added bonus with the remote was an extra AWESOME Feature!</p>

<p>The front of the train was pretty unique,actually,compared to previous train models that LEGO has released.The interior was pretty bare,consisting of the remote transmitter and the &quot;Battery Box&quot; /Engine.The operating of the engine was pretty simple and easy,with one single power switch to turn on/off.</p>

<p>I have to confess,the train cars add a &quot;farm&quot; landscape to the set,with the OCTAN&reg; Gas tank,the big round things,the forklift(Added AWESOME bonus),cool truck,train and the interesting cargo station.</p>

<p>The Cargo Station was actually pretty cool,because you can move the crane and lower the rope to pick up/transfer cargo onto the truck.The Office was very simple,although adding a touch of elegancy&nbsp;to the office would have increased the monetary value.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>The Power functions was a bit hard to figure out initially,because the instructions manual doesn&#39;t exactly tell you how to turn on the engine,which took me a bit of time......The Magnet connectors really disappointed me anyways,because when I received the set,and finished building it.</p>

<p>The set was generally playful,especially for a kid&#39;s imagination....</p>

"PFOL","2016-06-01T14:50:27.2Z","Delightful for Kids and Adults!","<p>I&#39;m a parent of a 4yo son, but also a slight AFOL (loved them as a kid, but getting them for the son has resparked my interest after&nbsp;several decades), so this review mixes both perspectives.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Large box that my son loves to look at.&nbsp; Heavy cardboard as you would expect for a kit this size.&nbsp; Instructions are in the usual thin stapled booklets of varying sizes.&nbsp; I guess a hardcore fan would prefer a single bound book, but I liked it because it was easy to go through the individual booklets&nbsp;with my son over the course of a three-day holiday weekend, which is what we planned it for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the specialized parts, mostly the metal wheel axles, fork lift rubber band, and hoist string, came in smaller white boxes that were taped shut and slightly annoying to open, but that was because I was lazy and didn&rsquo;t want to get out a knife or scissors. It would have been nice if they had perforated seams (I think the string box did, but not the others).</p>

<p>One thing I noticed is that the picture of the truck in the front (and I think on the booklet as well) is either incorrect or misrepresenting.&nbsp; There is a half width (2 studs wide) beige crate that holds the grey box container, but this is not included in the set nor in the instructions.&nbsp; There are 4 stud-wide crates for the Octan tank, cable reels, and the green wheelbarrow, but no pieces allocated for the narrower crate shown in the box.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Lots of new and interesting pieces for my son and me since this was our first train set.&nbsp; Some of the interesting parts were the forklift mechanism using the rubber band, the rails for the hoist and of course the train-specific parts like the wheels,&nbsp;magnet connectors and the electrical parts/remote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, we could always do with more track pieces.&nbsp; I think the set came with enough, but a few more pieces couldn&#39;t hurt!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Nothing too special to say about the minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>With the new parts this was interesting for me as an adult.&nbsp; A little difficult for my son to assemble most of it, but he was content to just find the parts for me as I was building what he couldn&#39;t.&nbsp; The cargo yard/hoist was probably the most tricky part because the frames and railing are long.&nbsp; The instructions have you connecting several in a line that is easy to break apart while you are moving on to the next step.&nbsp; You also have to deal with threading the string for the hook.</p>

<p>The way the electrical components and wiring are built in is ingenious; I love how the IR receiver and the on/off button were integrated into the freight engine, pretty slick indeed!</p>

<p>The other cars aren&#39;t too complicated and don&#39;t contribute all that much&nbsp;to the building experience itself.</p>

<p>Not too many stickers considering the size of the set, and most enhanced the details.&nbsp; There were a handful I skipped, though.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>What a great set.&nbsp; The sheer size and magnitude&nbsp;are awesome.&nbsp; The hoist and forklift give a lot of play value, although rotating the red hoist knob is a little cumbersome for the boy when he&rsquo;s playing.&nbsp; The hoist wheels have a tendency to fall off the rails while trying to turn the knob.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like the RC functions, there&#39;s a little learning curve, but very easy after you familiarize yourself with the buttons.&nbsp; My son has no trouble using the RC on his own.&nbsp; It&#39;s a joy to watch him operate the train.</p>

<p>I feel the cattle car is a little out of place for a cargo train that has cable reels and gas tanks.&nbsp;&nbsp;A box car or another industrial-themed car, perhaps a large oil tanker, would have been much more appreciated.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m not a cow rancher/farmer so I&rsquo;m no expert in identifying cow breeds and genders, but I could swear the cow is a bull because of its long horns, yet the farmer has a red pail with a white stud to represent liquid inside, which I presume to be milk&hellip; ;-)</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Well, I&rsquo;m half upset that I bought this because now I want to expand the train collection&hellip; uhm&hellip; for my son.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve been through this already with the Thomas the Train wooden train line, and it was not kind to my wallet.&nbsp; These train sets aren&rsquo;t cheap when you factor the price per piece, but they are loads of fun and have tremendous play value.&nbsp; I&#39;m glad I was able to snag this on sale; the $200 msrp is a bit steep.</p>
