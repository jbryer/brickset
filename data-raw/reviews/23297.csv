<p>Standard small box</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts can be made out from the pics, nice assortment of orange pieces such as cheese bricks and slopes, and the arctic logo is printed. 2 new ski pieces (obviously!) as well as a silver crystal inside the trans blue, and short chain piece to tow the trailer. Overall quite a nice interesting little assortment.</p>

<p>Spares = cheese block in smoked trans and orange and a ice axe</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>nice printed clothing,legs and head</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>something that could do in your sleep, especially those within the age band</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>is a nice looking little snow mobile, the skis swing easily so will swoosh over most things and has a nice overall shape but the minifig will have to stand up, so no long journeys for him or her!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>within the price range is probably one of the most interesting and builds up to a nice little model to fit with some of the bigger arctic kits, nice change from police sets too!</p>

"TannerTheHunter","2014-08-25T02:07:24.83Z","'Cool' impulse buy.","<p>Have no fear, this review won&#39;t be full of ice puns. I had always liked the looks of the Arctic&nbsp;sets released under&nbsp;Town, but never have gotten around to buying one, so I&#39;m glad Lego decided to reboot it with City. Now onto the review. (Note: I was previously NickBrick on this site several years ago, I doubt anyone remembers me, but just saying I&#39;m not a newbie to reviewing. Though I would appreciate feedback in any form.)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The model is prominently displayed nicely in the front with mostly everything visible (save for the radio), with an as-you-would-expect icy&nbsp;background. (Who knew Lego City had so many varieties of terrain so near it...)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>To be perfectly honest, the main reason I purchased this set was for that lovely trans-light blue&nbsp;boulder and the silver crystal. XD It&#39;s not too often we get an ice pick either, and the set includes a double. The other good parts being the the 2x4 slope with the nice printing, I can see those skis coming in handy, and for those (such as myself) who&#39;ve never gotten a hold of a &#39;small&#39; chain, or the new parka for that matter, this is a cheap way to get those. Pretty good parts overall.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>We get one minifig here, who&#39;s printing I must say I love. The printing on the torso (front and back) looks great, and great leg print as well. The face is new I think, though I should wonder why he&#39;s so happy to romp around in the frozen tundra. I like the face to be honest though. Nice minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The build is a cakewalk, as are most City sets in my opinion. Once it&#39;s build, it looked quite good. Nothing is really &#39;wrong&#39; with this model at all, save for perhaps the snowmobile&#39;s &#39;treads&#39; being simply black slope elements. It&#39;s about the right size for some $7, though another minifigure would have really made it worth it. Design is good, and it fits in perfectly with the larger&nbsp;Arctic models such as 60036.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a small set to get the lovely re-colored boulder, this is the one. In a way the crystal-in-boulder&nbsp;concept in the Arctic sets reminds of Rock Raiders. Its an &#39;ice&#39;&nbsp;little impulse set. (Okay, one more awful pun had to be used.) Good design, simple build, good minifig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the overall this set gets 4 bricks out of 5, solid set which I recommend easily. Good to see some variety in Lego City again.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:51:27.72Z","Ready to Explore the Arctic?","<p><strong>Set # 60032 Arctic Snowmobile: </strong>LEGO City introduced the Arctic sub-theme, this is the smallest boxed set and features very little in the way of build techniques or pieces. However this one is fun mostly because it includes the LEGO rock piece in crystal blue colours for a frozen ice look. Definitely a fun little set and we&rsquo;ll go over all of the reasons why in the following sections of the review.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: Small and standard fare from LEGO City boxes, the image on the front and back show some great play options for the set.</p>

<p>Instructions: For a LEGO City set this small, the instructions feature the most pages, each part of the build is broken down in a step-by-step fashion that is standard in LEGO sets. However you&rsquo;ll also find a picture of the entire Arctic Sub-Theme, a secret code page for the LEGO City online game and app, another image of all the LEGO City Transportation based sets along with a quick shot of each set in that range and last, but not least, a quick shot of the LEGO Train sets from 2014. A lot of pages of pictures in a set this small.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Arctic Explorer: Highly detailed, this Minifigure includes a double-sided orange torso with blue gloves, a pair of dark blue legs with very well detailed print for ice climbing harness elements and the headpiece is the new hood used first with Han Solo (Hoth) from the Polybag. He has a single sided facial print with orange goggles over his eyes and for accessories he includes a walkie-talkie and ice pick, first seen with the Mountain Climber CMF figure I believe.</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>This is a nice little model, it&rsquo;s a great looking snowmobile built mostly out of bright orange pieces, there is a printed element used for the Arctic Expedition logo and that is a piece that many MOC fans might find quite useful in their builds. With a chain piece you can pull a small sled which houses the frozen rock, inside is a metallic silver looking crystal piece, valuable item. Overall it&rsquo;s a solid looking build for such a small set.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>As a fan of the older Arctic based sets from LEGO, especially Ice Planet 2002, this is a nice looking update of LEGO Arctic vehicles. It&rsquo;s definitely worth picking up as part of the Arctic Sub-Theme from LEGO City and makes for a good cheap little army builder of sets for a huge Arctic display. Recommended.</p>

"jasper93","2014-08-26T18:54:12.167Z","Great introductory set for both kids and older collectors","<p>As someone who liked the Arctic sets from the early 2000&#39;s as a kid, this set from the&nbsp;2014 Arctic subtheme immediately caught my attention. Not only is it great to see Lego breathe some new life into this subtheme, the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60032-1/Arctic-Snowmobile"">60032&nbsp;Arctic Snowmobile</a> also feels like a very complete set for its size. It is a must-have for any older collectors, and it is a nice and interesting small set for younger kids.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The box is a standard small one nicely displaying the completed model speeding through a snowy<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span><span class=""scayt-misspell-word"">landscape</span><span class=""apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span>on the front.

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This set contains a nice variety of pieces including ski pieces, some accesories like a walkie-talkie, an&nbsp;ice pick (+ one extra) and a small chain connecting the snowmobile to&nbsp;the sled. In addition, the translucent blue ice boulder (found in virtually every set from the 2014 Arctic line) looks great and holds a silver crystal. The curved piece on the front with the Arctic logo is actually printed and not a sticker, which is a big plus in my view. The colour scheme for this set and the other Arctic sets is nice; the distinct bright orange pieces feel fitting for the theme&nbsp;and are relatively&nbsp;uncommon.</span><br />

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>We get one&nbsp;minifig, a male Arctic explorer. He has some nice details on his legs, his torso (which also has the Arctic logo on the back) and hood, and he&nbsp;wears some orange goggles. There is no&nbsp;back printing&nbsp;on the head.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The completed snowmobile looks sleek and has some small features that add to its playability. The skis on the front can be swung&nbsp;360 degrees, allowing the vehicle to easily move over any curved surfaces or &quot;hills&quot;. The small chain can be used to connect the snowmobile to&nbsp;the sled, which can then serve to transport the ice boulder. Perhaps the sled itself looks a bit plain, but it does the job. Overall, it looks a bit&nbsp;better and feels more interesting than the&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6577-1/Snow-Scooter"">6577&nbsp;Snow Scooter</a> from 2000.<br />

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">In conclusion, there is quite a lot to like for such a small set. It is an essential set for any collectors of the 2014 Arctic line and for those who liked the Arctic sets from the early 2000&#39;s. Moreover, it will serve as a great gift for kids because of its relatively simple build, its playability and decent mobility, and it is one of the better sets in this price range.</span><br />

"Cityfan2000","2014-12-29T13:40:05.143Z","Good small set ","<p>Personally I found this a good small set and i would recommend you to buy it. Now lets look at different aspects of the set in more detail.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is similar to all other city sets. Has the city logo on the top left corner of the box and then a picture of a mini figure riding on the snow mobile. The set comes with 2 bags of bricks. One for larger bricks and then one for smaller bricks. It comes with a small set on instructions that clearly shows each step you need to build it</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with a good range of parts. Most of them are common in the arctic sets. The only pieces that were an interest to me was the chain linking the snowmobile to the trailer and the ice pick. I also liked the printed Arctic piece which goes on the front and this means there is no need for stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with one Minifigure which is pretty similar to all the other minifigures in the other arctic sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As with all &pound;4.99 sets the build isn&#39;t very challenging. With these types of sets I normally build them without the instructions to make it more challenging. But even with out instructions it still only took around 4 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is good. I like that it looks like a realistic model and has some playability. My only issue is that the snowmobile doesn&#39;t have a belt instead it has some curved black pieces but personally i don&#39;t think they do the job of looking like a belt very well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I said in the introduction i think this is a good set and for &pound;4.99 i would definitely recommend you to buy it.</p>

"ModularRoger","2015-06-28T03:09:30.033Z","Nice Arctic Souvenir","<p>Although the Arctic theme appeals to me quite a bit, collecting it was beyond my means. This snowmobile at least provides a small but interesting sampling of the colors and parts of this theme.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a few nice, specific parts, in particular the hollow blue ice block, silver crystal and a couple of ice picks. The front ski attachments and the chain are also of note. The bright orange&nbsp;pieces make quite a good&nbsp;impression, although in these limited quantities&nbsp;they are not the most versatile color for repurposing in MOCs. The sloped piece with the printed Arctic logo (the snowmobile&#39;s hood)&nbsp;is very cool.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The printing on the arctic explorer&#39;s torso, face and legs is very nice. There are plenty of functional as well as decorative details. The parka-style hood is a refreshingly simple piece, since it goes on as a helmet (i.e. no neck connections or backpacks or anything like that) looks good and is easy to remove.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>As expected, extremely easy, nothing too interesting in the putting together.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>It looks good. The front of the snowmobile has a pleasingly curved shape. The tail section works well to vaguely approximate the look of a tread, but without moving pieces. A few gear/towing attachment points do their jobs. My one complaint is that the skis are very loose. A higher-friction fit would be better, as they only maintain alignment when the snowmobile is flat against a surface; otherwise, they spin freely. The sled is basic in the extreme, and the lack of true skis may be&nbsp;an obstacle to free-sliding.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The snowmobile is very ground-swooshable with or without the sled attached and I think that playability is good overall, as several scenarios can be played out (exploration, rescue, light mining). For me personally, this was a nice inexpensive way to pick up an Arctic minifigure and ice block/crystal. At somewhere in the neighborhood of $5-$7, a solid acquisition.</p>

"Roan_s_sets_","2017-08-22T17:22:09.357Z","The Earth Snowspeeder","<p>I was sent this as a gift by the lego group as I was unable to enter a competition, It is a good set and the playability is fun however it can get boring, my nan also got me one for christmas.It doesn&#39;t disappoint</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Parts</strong></p>

<p>Orange has always been a rare color in my lego&nbsp;box but this set has plenty of orange! The 2x2 slope (Although in over sets) Is a nice piece</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Playability</strong></p>

<p>It can get a tad old doing the same thing over but the set has a nice idea: The main character has discovered an old ice boulder, he picks it open and discovers a crystal, ready to take it back to base! This idea is interesting yet I found it odd, why does he have the trailer if he&#39;s already ice picked it with his handy ice pick?</p>

<p><strong>The Value</strong></p>

<p>The value is good however I believe it&#39;s a shame it couldn&#39;t have had one more minifigure,maybe even a husky?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Its simple but a&nbsp;cool build nevertheless</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>a good set but a shame about not having one more figure 4/5</p>
