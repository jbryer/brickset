"mini_mads1980","2014-05-25T17:14:06.623Z","Good Set At A Good Price","<p>I just got&nbsp;my Arctic Ice Crawler from one of the two big toy shops at Bristol&#39;s Cribbs Causeway.&nbsp; This was the only one of the Arctic sets that they had, so I was not able to take too much advantage of the 10% off for the Bank Holiday weekend.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw these sets I knew I wanted them, so hopefully once made they will be as good as I hoped.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has a large image on the front of the Ice Crawler with the sole occupant holding a pick-axe, with the ice rock hanging from the arm of the Ice Crawler. On top of the box there is the 1:1 scale image of the Minifig, placed at a right angle to normal due to the size of the box.&nbsp; Also on top of the box is an image of the Minifig holding a saw this time, having opened the ice rock revealing the precious material inside.</p>

<p>The box has various warning messages on the bottom and the barcode.&nbsp; The side you open has the same image as the front, and the other side has information regarding where the bricks were made and a logo for the Lego Club.</p>

<p>Inside the box there is a 48-page instruction book, a sticker sheet, two un-numbered bags and two rubber wheel tracks.&nbsp; The booklet does give nice images of the other Arctic sets and the new train sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You only get one Minifig in this set, so I would say other sets are more desirable.&nbsp; The vehicle can&#39;t contain more than one Minifig, so there are no complaints from me regarding the number in the set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build could not be classed as tricky at all.&nbsp; My only real complaint would be step 29, where you place the grey 4 bar to the top of the windscreen.&nbsp; As the roof of the cab is not connected to the back of the cab, I pushed the bar into place and took the whole thing off!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is not anything special, but by no means bad and took a little over ten minutes to build.&nbsp; It seems sturdy enough and is not likely to fall apart too easily, despite the cab connection at the back, when in play.&nbsp; The Minifig sits nicely in the middle, however I always prefer to change the construction to have the driver on the right, I am English after all!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set, but I think 60035 will be my favourite from this theme.&nbsp; Also, the &pound;10 (ish) price tag for this set with one Minifig&nbsp;is fair.</p>

"CrescentSky","2015-11-22T02:33:07.15Z","To The North Pole!","<p>&nbsp;When I&nbsp;bought this set, I had no idea of how good it would turn out. For a relatively cheap price, this set comes with&nbsp;the truck, an ice block, one minifig, and much more.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is unusually long for city sets, and is probably too big for the size of the set, but overall not a big deal. The instructions are classic city instructions, easy to follow and read.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too fancy here, though it&#39;s worth mentioning that&nbsp;there are two&nbsp;1x2 cheese slopes in orange, and an orange 1x6x4 wall piece. The rest of the set has pretty common pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One minifig is included in the set, an explorer with a heavy jacket and parka. The torso,legs, and hood&nbsp;are the same ones in all other arctic sets, and the head is in some other sets as well. It is detailed well, however, and works fine for the set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is nothing special, but enjoyable nonetheless. I was actually surprised by how much I liked building it, even though it only took me abut five to ten minutes. A&nbsp;child would be fine building it by themselves&nbsp;though. Generally just a nice, standard city build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks good for what it is and functions nicely. The treads work great on all surfaces (because they&#39;re rubber), and the crane on the back has good mobility. The only thing I would point out is that it appears a bit stubby and short lengthwise.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I grew to like this set before I bought it, and now that I have I love it. I was able to get it for $12.74 USD, but even at $14.99 USD retail it&#39;s still a good price. If you want an arctic set, I would definitely recommend this one.&nbsp;</p>
