"Skut","2015-07-16T00:03:24.463Z","One of the best Lego choppers ever","<p>This is a magnificent set and a real highlight of the Arctic (or, for those of us in the Southern hemisphere, Antarctic) line.&nbsp; Indeed it&#39;s one of Lego&#39;s best ever helicopters in the City theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts array is impressive, with Technic elements used to give structural rigidity to the helicopter&#39;s frame.&nbsp; The overall look of the helicopter strongly resembles an Erickson/Sikorsky S-64 aircrane - perhaps a similar set can be included in the next round of Fire sets as a waterbomber?</p>

<p>The dog sled team is a great part of the set and really adds to playability.&nbsp; The arctic dog element is a great addition to the Lego animals &quot;stable&quot; and showcases how far brick printing technology has come.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Polar-clad minifigs are well up to the standards of printing and quality we have come to expect from TLG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set&#39;s not perfect.&nbsp; The chopper&#39;s winch mechanism is affixed only by a 2x2 plate which means it has a tendency to come loose when hoisting up the cargo pallet.&nbsp; The cargo pallet also suffers from some structural weakness and two 1x4 plates or four 2x2 corner plates from your spares collection will be needed to reinforce it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And of course, as a City set (apart from trains), it features the egregious white-paper stickers which are lucky to last 2 years before cracking, splintering or falling off.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given these stickers are intended to be applied to&nbsp;elements that last decades, this is not good enough.&nbsp; TLG must do better in this area (ie. clear film stickers or printed bricks in all sets)&nbsp;or risk a customer class action for selling goods of unmerchantable quality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the drawbacks, it&#39;s a&nbsp;great set for kids and AFOLS alike with stacks of play value and swooshability.&nbsp; Well worth the money.&nbsp;</p>
