"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-04T19:04:50Z","2nd Best so far","Second only to the Hogwarts Castle in my growing Prisoner of Azkaban collection, this set is truly a work of art.  Honeydukes is in need of modifications (i.e. stabilization and roof completion).  The LEGO Figure Transformer is very juniorized, although I can't resist pressing the button on my way out the door.  The shack itself features a collapsing bed, a secret compartment in the desk, and a chimney escape.  The shack also turns.  Peter Pettigrew is an odd minifigure.  This set features a standing rat, rather like the owl, just a rat.  Overall, great set.  You'd have to buy it to get the real feel of it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-16T20:12:13Z","i think this set isn pretty good but i could have done better.","i think this set is pretty good but the little building thingy next to the shreiking shack itself is lego's number one worst bit of work.  it is like one big peice!!  i think the shreiking shack itself is pretty good although i still would have made it out of more smallish peices.  the biggest problem with those really big peices is that you can'y build any thing else with them afterwards.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-14T21:53:50Z","Good","I like the shack personally. It looks great in the combination of brown and white colour. There are lots of windows. 

Besides, I like the cherry and apple in the sweet shop. The figure transformer is just ok.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-22T15:56:49Z","Really Cool","I found it on clearance at Wal*Mart for $15, and I'm very glad I bought it. The design of the shack is very nice, and it really looks like an abandoned house. Although there are only four features in the house, they all work well. The fireplace exit could used as part of a flu network, the collapsing bed is cool, and the room under the house can be used to store the animals when not in play. It also comes with LOTS of accesories- the set includes ice-cream bars, apples, small book tiles, cherries, lollipops, a wine glass, a backpack, a cash register, and even a frog! The transformation shed works well too. When switching between Sirius and Snuffles, Sirius comes out standing 2/3 of the time and the dog every time. Unfortunately, I have never lifted the shed to find Scabbers standing. Honeydukes isn't too bad either, the windows used are quite nice. Overall, this is a very well designed set, that is also fun to play with..",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-19T06:20:25Z","The most haunted house in whole Great-Britain, but there is not asingle ghost in it.","The shack is good, very good. It has very much new brown pieces, 1 door and at least 5 windows. There is a new piece in it which will let the house turn round, I dont understand why that is, but it is ingenios. The fireplace have a secret door in the backside who maybe leads to the corridor to the Womping Willow. The great change piecehouse is a nice idea, but I liked it more when it was made of more little pieces, because when you put something in it, it never stands upwhen it goes out of it. 
The sweetshop is great, but it was nice when they put it in a different set, made it larger and put some hogwarts students and the bald owner of the shop in it.
The figs are nice and the animal forms of the 3 adults also, only is it very wrong to give them flesh colours. The sets for movie 4 have also flesh colours, but I hope they make them for movie 5 again the normal Yellow.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legolander","2007-04-26T03:11:11.153Z","Shrieking excellent!","This is another of the best Harry Potter sets that I have. Again, the only problem that I see is the space for minifigs and other pieces.But I think this set is great. It comes with a candy shop (Honeydukes). I wish they made a separate set so as to enjoy the fun stuff that's inside it. It has also a Minifig Transformer that's used to turn wizards into animals. Great isn't it?! Anyway, there's nothing wrong with this set. Actually, the Prisoner of Azkaban LEGO sets are the best of all the Harry Potter sets because everything is so detailed. I sure hope that they would make more sets especially now that the fifth movie is about to be released. I know there's a new Hogwarts Castle set(5378(?)), but I think 4757 is still the best. I give this set 4 stars!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-24T20:27:51.373Z","awsome set.","ill start with the candy shop. i like it lots, it has a tonne of candy, a trap door, cash register and realy cool windows. 
the transforming shack is pretty good, but it would be better if you actualy got to build it and the guy never stands up when you lift it.
the shreaking shack rocks, it has a secret door in the chimny, the bed falls through, the windows have cool boards over them, and the roof is well done, except theres no stairs! any way theres a trap door leading from the passege way, and for some reason the house spins. i dont no why, but ti does it comes with a weird new spinning piece, which is cool.
the minifigures are great. the wherewolf head is very good harry looks cool and serius is very good too. worm tail is ok but not great. overall this set rocks! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoAdventures","2011-01-21T01:32:58.773Z","Shrieking Shack","""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">It's meant to be the most Haunted House in Britain</span>"" Hermione once said to Ron whilst looking at the Shrieking Shack, and to be honest i can't help but say how Adorably Wonderful the Lego remake is. This is an Exquisite set that is enthralled with numerous features that are Rare and Unique and the design is Architecturally Outstanding. This set is full of playability and creativity that will last for many, many hours which I will reveal in my review. &nbsp; <br>Released in 2004 to Coincide with the Blockbuster release of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span>, it contains 444 Pieces 4 Mini-figures, The Shrieking Shack, HoneyDukes Fine Confectionery Store and a Custom Transformation Shed type Lego piece. This Particular set I managed to get of Bricklink for $200 in a New Sealed Box in Excellent Condition and although the price was quiet high it was unfortunately the cheapest price at the time. Nevertheless i can strongly say that is what certainly well worth the money for this Superior set.<br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions:</h4><br>The Box is 38cm Long, 28.5cm Tall and 9.3cm Thick. The Box has It's usual front Illustration of The Shrieking Shack, Transformation Shed and HoneyDukes Fine Confectionery Store and the usual Red Lego Insignia. All around the back, the sides and a small front section of the Box is covered in the colour Blue like all the other Prisoner of Azkaban sets. At the back of the Box is an Illustration of all the Prisoner of Azkaban sets (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apart from the Exclusive 10132 Motorized Hogwarts Express</span>) All the sets are Trans-White and see through apart from the Shrieking Shack which isn't see through and is coloured. This Illustration is on all of the Prisoner of Azkaban sets, Instructions and Pamphlets with the set. There is other features on the back of the Box like an image of inside the Shrieking Shack and HoneyDukes and an Alternative image, which you can download from LEGO.com however i don't think the Link is there anymore. Other features on the Box include an image of how to use the Transformation Shed and other Angles of the Set. Last but not least, on the bottom of the Box there is Future References, Licensed Agreements, Trademarks, Copyrights and where the Components are made, In this set the Components are made in Denmark, Switzerland, Korea, China and Hong Kong (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">A very strange combination of Countries involved indeed, however I'm guessing the pieces are made in Denmark and Switzerland and the Box or packaging or possibly the Custom Transformation Shed type Lego piece are made in Korea, China and Hong Kong</span>) After all that's what i love about Lego is that it's Quality European Manufactured. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>Inside the box there is 6 Plastic bags which are not Numbered, so the Building Experience may be more difficult or longer considering you have to find each piece in a different bag. There is the Transformation Shed piece and a Note by Lego (<span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Note: There is a Black and White coloured note by Lego that informs you that a piece has been changed for another piece. When looking at the Shrieking Shack from the front view, the piece that has been changed is the Black piece that is supporting the Skeleton Skull piece. I'm not sure if this is a change that was determined with all the Shrieking Shack sets produced, however this is what i received in my set. The replaced piece that you receive is a Technic Angle Connector, if you're not sure what that looks like go to Peeron.com and Search 4756 in the Search tab and scroll down it will show the Technic Angle Connector that you receive as the replace piece or go to Bricklink.com and search for the piece there in the Parts section</span>) And last but not least you receive the 39 page instruction manual, 48 including the illustrations at the back. <br><br><h4>Mini-figs:</h4><br style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor Remus John Lupin</span> also Known as <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Moony</span> or <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Professor R.J Lupin:</span></span> Professor Lupin features his Wavy-Styled Dark Orange Hair (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Identical to Gilderoy Lockharts Hair piece</span>). He features Sparkling Innocently Calm eyes, slightly raised Black eyebrows, a lovely Quirky sort of smile and curled Grey Moustache with 2 long diagonal Salmon-Flesh claw scratches along his face. His Torso features a Dark Olive Green Suit and a light Mint Green work T-Shirt with a Jet Black Tie that seems to have a very small tear. Going down his Suit he has 2 Silver buttons with 2 Black holes in each. His Suit also features 2 Pockets and 3 tears around the Chest and bottom of the Suit. He has Dark Olive Pants and a Beautiful Light Stone Grey Cape resembling his Robes. Professor Lupin also has a Werewolf head which enables him to become a Werewolf. A strange detail i noticed is on the front of the Box Professor Lupin actually seems to have a Zip up Jacket which covers his uniform however this isn't included in the set which i thought was a bit strange. <br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sirius Black </span>also known as <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Padfoot:</span></span> Sirius Black features long Greasy Hair. He features Very Kind, Calm Sparkling eyes with Thin Black Eyebrows. He has a Thin Black Moustache with a pleasing Smile and various Stubble around his Chin. His Torso Features a Dark Grey Azkaban Prison Outfit with Light Grey stripes. His Azkaban Prison Shirt looks very Tatty, Old and Ruined with Scruffy Collar and lace holding the Shirt together. There is also various Tears and Marks around the Outfit. And last but not least he has Dark Grey pants. One other strange detail (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Printing Error</span>) i noticed about Sirius is in the Instructions Sirius actually has Harry's Messy Hair instead of his Black long Hair. <br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Peter Pettigrew </span>also known as <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Wormtail:</span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>Lego has produced 2 different Peter Pettigrew Mini-figs the First is the one from this set <span style=""font-style: italic;"">4756 Shrieking Shack</span> and the second is in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">4766 Graveyard Duel</span>. Peter Pettigrew doesn't feature a Hair piece however he does have Hair. Peter Pettigrew features Orange strands of Hair around the Stud on top of the Mini-fig head. He also features Curious yet Sly Sparkling eyes and raised aware eyebrows, He has a lop sided messy Orange Moustache with a diagonal vile yet curious type of mouth. His Torso features a Light Grey Suit with a Mild Brownish Orange work T-Shirt and a White Vest which all feature Black Buttons. His Light Grey Suit also has Pockets and the entire Suit looks Tatty and almost Soggy like he's jumped in water. And last but not least he has Light Grey pants. <br><br style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Harry James Potter:</span> Harry features his usual Black Messy Hair, Red Lightning Scar Circular Glasses, brave Sparkling Black eyes and raised Black eyebrows with simple smile. His Torso features a Dark Grey Zip up Jacket with a Brownish-Crimson Red Sweater type top. And last but not least Tan-Beige type coloured pants. <br><br>Because Remus Lupin, Sirius Black and Peter Pettigrew are all Animagus which means they can Transform into Animals (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">If you didn't already know hehe</span>), Lego have also included there Animal form:<br><br style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Remus Lupin:</span> Werewolf Head<br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Peter Pettigrew:</span> Rat piece <br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Sirius Black:</span> A Grey Dog piece for his Grim/Dog appearance<br><br><h4>Transformation Shed: </h4><br>The Transformation Shed is a full Custom piece that has Lego Studs on the top of the Shed, and you place numerous White Snow Sloped type pieces on top of the Shed to make it look like a Snow covered roof, you also place a Jet Black Owl on top of the White Snow Sloped Pieces. Inside the Shed it is the shape of a Circle with a line in the middle so there's 2 sections, however on the bottom one side is covered up so one of the Animals (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Dog and Rat</span>) cannot fall out and has floor to stand on, and the other side has an opening so you can place the Shed over the Mini-fig of your choice. You then place the Animal of your choice on the ground, then you place the Shed over that Animal. You then Press a large Grey Button on the top of the Shed which spins and changes the 2 sides, so the Animal is now in the section that is concealed and has floor for the Animal to stand up. Now you place the Mini-fig on the Ground and put the Shed over the Mini-fig, Press the Grey button and the Mini-Fig comes out as an Animal, But it is really hidden in the section that is concealed. &nbsp; <br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm sorry if you couldn't understand that is was a bit difficult however if you download the Instructions for this set of Brickset or Peeron.com and look at the Illustrations for the Transformation Shed you should get some idea of what i meant, I was going to get an image of the Bottom of the Shed but i couldn't find one, so hopefully you understood what i meant :) </span><br><br><h4>HoneyDukes <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Fine Confectionery Store:</span></h4><br>HoneyDukes Candy Store is the most Cozy, Sweet and Magical part of the set it's just full of Sweets, Candy and Enchantments it really is a Stupendous little store. The Store has Hinges on it to enable it to close in and become a joined store, It then can be opened again to play inside or it can be fully opened to resemble the front of the store. When looking at the store from the front view you have 2 sides, The side which has 2 lovely front display windows and the other which is an entrance with little Lanterns, first i will talk about the side with the Front Entrance. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>The Front Entrance has 1 Light Grey Step leading up to a Door with an Arch on the top and 2 Lantern type Light Pieces on each side of the Door. Inside on the Right of the Door is a Printed Cash Register piece. On the left side of the door is a L type wall formation and in the corner is a Bright Yellow Dish that is suspended of the ground by 1 Beige-Cream Cylindrical type Lego piece. In the Bright Yellow Dish there is 1 Emerald Green Apple and 1 Geranium Red Apple. Above this Yellow Dish is a Triangle shaped Shelf with a Trans-Neon Green Square with a Trans-Neon Yellow Stud on top and a Trans-Neon Cobalt Blue Square with a Trans-Neon Orange stud on top, Both resembling Lolly Jars. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br>The Glass Display Windows Side has a Door on the far right when looking at it from the front view. In front of the Glass Display Windows there is a Light Grey Brick with a Groove in the middle and 4 Holes on the top. You place 1 Reddish Brown Popsicle/Ice Cream, 1 Dark Trans Pink Popsicle/Ice Block, 1 Trans-Neon Orange Cone piece with a Trans-Neon Green Stud on top and 1 Trans-Neon Cobalt Blue Cone piece with a Trans-Neon Yellow stud on top once again resembling some Lolly Jars. Next to this is a Brown table with a Trans-Neon Cone piece with a Trans-Neon Cobalt Blue stud on top resembling some sort of Lolly or Lolly Jar. In front of this is a Brown Bucket type Lego piece with 3 Red Cherries in it. Behind this Brown Table is 2 Black L shaped Lego Pieces this is now in front of the Cash register and in between one of the Black L shaped pieces is a 1x2 Tile slightly unwrapped Chocolate bar piece that has 1 bight in it and the pretty wrapping is pulled back. The rest of HoneyDukes is some White roof pieces resembling a snow covered roof and 2 Lollipop pieces above the front windows showing that it's a Confectionery sweets shop.<br><br><h4>Shrieking Shack:</h4><br>The Shack itself is Built on a small Snow covered base plate which has a Turning wheel, that enables you to turn the entire Shrieking Shack in one motion. You start of by building numerous wall structures, you also start of by building a secret compartment in the middle of the bottom floor. You place a Cute little Emerald Green Frog in the compartment you then finish by putting a Beige piece over the frog so it looks like a simple desk, but it opens to reveal the little Frog. You then place a small 1x1 Tile with a picture of a Blue Book that is open and has little Gold stars and writing all over it on top of the Desk. There is also a 1x2 Trans-Clear Blue Tile that has a number of Gold Stars on it that you place on the Desk to. You also Build a Small Fireplace on the wall that has some Trans-Orange studs in it, and behind that is a piece of the wall that has Hinges so you can enter through a secret door in the wall. You then place a Brown Door for the Front Entrance and in front of the Door is 2 Light Grey steps, you also place 2 White Windows with Brown Shutters Near the Door and on other part of the wall. You then Build a small formation of Snow above the door Resembling a Snow covered Roof. Then you Build an interesting Mechanism that has a Skeleton Head attached to a Technic piece that has a Technic Axle which supports a section on the second floor. After Building the Second floor you have a very small Fireplace which is much Smaller than the first floor. You also Build a small Cyan Bluish Grey Bed (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">There is no floor underneath the bed so when you look up from the bottom floor you can see the bed</span>) that has a small Pillow piece and 2 Cylindrical Beige pieces resembling the Back Side decorations on the Bed. Underneath the Bed there is some pieces that are connected to each other and one is connected to a small piece next to the Bed which you build some more pieces around so you can make it look like a bed side table. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sorry that was a bit hard to explain :( </span>But Anyway it all comes together now, so you pull the Skeleton piece that i mentioned earlier and that makes the back of the bed tilt through the floor because the Technic Axle that was attached to the Skeleton Piece and Technic Angle isn't there anymore (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Remember the Bed is attached to the Bed side table with some pieces that allow it to only Tilt thought the floor not actually fall</span>). &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>You then place a Trans-Neon Orange Cone piece with a Trans-Neon Yellow stud on top. Next to that is a Trans-Neon Green Mini-fig Wine Glass. You then Build some more White Windows with Brown Shutters and a Formation over the Fire place. You then build various Snow Covered Pieces to resemble the Snow covered Roofs. You then Build some Brown walls at the very top sides of the Shack and then you place 1 Long 6x12 Plate and a small Chimney formation at the top of the Shack. Then last but not least you place a Trans-Neon Orange Spider under the Shrieking Shack and then you place 4 Planks of Wood across the Door and some of the Windows to keep Intruders out. <br><br><h4>Overall:</h4><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm sorry if some of the things i said were hard understand, however i tried to do it the best i could.</span> Overall i think this is a Superb set that is full of wonderful elements, Mini-figs and features that will last for hours upon hours. It is Enchanting and Magical and i strongly Recommend it to anyone with full confidence that you will enjoy it, a complete Triumph! 5/5<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review :)",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"ledaKat","2009-12-03T14:40:27.827Z","Best Harry Set Yet!","As my title suggests, I think this is the best Harry Potter set that I own. Love the minifigs! Brilliant use of brown bricks and the white snow capped windows and door of the shack is delightful. They have really captured the charming, magical feel of Hogsmede from the film. The shrieking shack swivels on its base to great effect.  It has lots of fine little details, lollypops, special printed tiles, two fireplaces, a trapdoor under Honeydukes. Love Lupin's werewolf head!
The little magic box is a fun addition. You place the appropriate figures inside, push the button and like magic Sirius turns to Padfoot and Wormtail to Scabbers!
Honeydukes is a quaint little shop full of candy, it looks great and is a nice beginning to creating a full Hogsmede town if you have the wish to expand on this set. I got this set last week and now my next step after building it is to try and create the Hogshead tavern.
Pros:
Minifigs
Lots of brown bricks
Snow capped roofs and windows
Honedukes
Magic box
Swivel base
Boarded up windows
No stickers!
Cons:
Would have loved to see a Prongs fig...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
