"Whateverist","2014-06-28T21:56:42.303Z","Fantastic adventure set","<p>Adventure and exploration. These are the themes that LEGO is really good at, and this Arctic set is a perfect example.</p>

<p>Open up the trailer, and you have an Arctic base. Inside there&#39;s a full interior with a really cool microscope - binoculars on a roof tile! - and a teeny little stove. The trailer manages to look convincing inside and out. A nice touch is the storage area in the front, which is sized just right for some tools and the ice saw one of the minifigures normally carries.</p>

<p>Close everything up and you have an Arctic exploration truck. The truck cab is a lovely solid chunk and feels built to last. The large tires and lightbars really add to the look. You also get an articulated crane and another large storage space for tools.</p>

<p>Because the truck is on wheels and the trailer is on skis, it doesn&#39;t roll all that well, but I guess that was never the point.</p>

<p>The ATV feels like a bit of an afterthought but it&#39;s nicely built and comes with a cool tow chain.</p>

<p>There are stickers, unfortunately, even though the ATV gets a printed brick on the front (boo for giving false hope!). There aren&#39;t many stickers, though, and they are all pretty easy to apply. Most can even be left off altogether.</p>

<p>I can heartily recommend this set. It looks cool, it&#39;s really fun to play with, and for the price it&#39;s excellent value for money.</p>

"Megalodon86","2015-11-01T06:32:08.733Z","Nice set, works really when within the artic theme","<p>With the&nbsp;artic subtheme&nbsp;from 2014 Lego managed to give every set something special (something to want). In this case the big truck comes with a forward base on skis, and the only quad atv in the artic&nbsp;line-up.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions are clear, like always nowadays. For a parent/afol they seem to use too much steps, but for a kid it great like this. Building my old sets (from the &#39;90s) my son might forget a piece here and there, but with these instructions that never happened.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I like the parts, they are pretty straight forward, but having so much more in orange is nice, for future moc&#39;ing. The 1x2 plates with one stud on the front of the truck did seem a bit sharp around the edges, but maybe i&#39;m just used to a bit more worn pieces. There&#39;s one printed piece (on the atv), all other graphics are stickers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set contains three&nbsp;minifigures, one with a cap and two with a hood.</p>

<h3>The build and&nbsp;completed model</h3>

<p>The build was fun. It&#39;s a very sturdy one too, not a lot of pieces come of during building or&nbsp;playing. It&#39;s bigger&nbsp;than i thought, quite a bit larger than other lego trucks of recent years. This is mostly because of the large wheels.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall a great set which goes together excellent with the arctic base camp (no double features)&nbsp;and the helicrane. With the minifigure tools like the pickaxe and saw, there&#39;s some play value. Most fun seems to be the crane on the truck, and sending stuff to the base camp, using the helicrane. Without the helicrane set, you could use the atv for transporting stuff.</p>

<p>So bottomline; it&#39;s&nbsp;fun to build, but for play&nbsp;value it really shines combined with other artic sets.</p>
