When I first saw this set online I was already luvin&nbsp;it !The bright orange brick mixed with the dark grey are great. The mini-figures authentic looking fur malachi&#39;s&nbsp;with tight blue color really stand out.</p>

<p>This set gets you ready for some winter and ice exploration, even if its 90 outside ! The research camp is placed on mini posts, the opening doors and ability to arrange and combine are superb. You get a full range of arctic vehicles from the dog sled team with Huskies to a Catapilar&nbsp;truck and the cool snow go !&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this set is perfect, it gives you a nice range of brick types to work with and the instructions &nbsp; were dead on as well a many detailed photos on the box, excellent value and playability this set is a &nbsp;welcome addition to my Lego Pueblo !&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typical of current City sets.&nbsp; Nothing to report.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Orange!&nbsp; And lots of it!&nbsp; Also a decent array of newer and less common parts, which is always a plus.&nbsp; The caterpillar treads are delightful, but I&#39;ll comment on that later.&nbsp; There is an abundance of MOC fodder, so even if you aren&#39;t impressed by this set, I would certainly recommend it as an excellent parts pack.&nbsp; I imagine we&#39;ll see a number of orange space ships and submarines surface in the next few months.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are quite a few!&nbsp; Can&#39;t complain about quantity.&nbsp; A little on the homogeneous side though, with four nearly-identical hooded explorers.&nbsp; The pilot, camera man, and scientist add a little more variety.&nbsp; At seven minifigs in one set, I can hardly justify pickiness.&nbsp; In the future I may swap out the explorers&#39; orange torsos for blue ones to match the hoods.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing too challenging, but it was engaging enough.&nbsp; The most noteworthy technique is the construction of the mobile drill truck thingy.&nbsp; At first glance the vehicle was my least favorite element of the set, but as I started to build it, it quickly gained favor in my eyes.&nbsp; While the truck actually rests on a single, hidden wheel, the treads still function beautifully.&nbsp; Maneuvering the truck around the table top actually had me quite giddy for a few minutes.&nbsp; The cab and drill rig aren&#39;t the prettiest, but the treads...so good.&nbsp; The helicopter isn&#39;t much to look at, but it works.&nbsp; The snowmobile is a sleek little thing, and the dogsled is actually a fun little build.&nbsp; The science lab / living quarters opens up at various points for great playability, and the conveyor belt is a nice touch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really enjoy the overall look and feel of the set.&nbsp; So much so that I built a diorama to showcase it, which you can view <a href=""http://erylion.deviantart.com/art/LEGO-Arctic-Base-Camp-459486669"">here</a>.&nbsp; The huskies and polar bear are even better up close than they looked from the pictures, and are indisputably the stars of this set, with the caterpillar treads coming in at a close second.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would happily recommend this set to anyone.&nbsp; Great parts, lots of minifigs/animals, orange, and a fun break from the typical police/fire themes that we see almost yearly.&nbsp; We were flip-flopping between this set and the ice breaker ship, which includes almost all the same elements except that instead of a stationary base you get a ship.&nbsp; Since we purchased the Coast Guard ship last year, we didn&#39;t feel the need to get another one with such a similar color scheme.&nbsp; Other than that, the two sets both have 7 minifigures, the same animals, and similar small vehicles to complement the main attractions.</p>

"bitsyww2","2016-02-26T17:58:48.753Z","Cute and fun!","<p>City has never been one of my preferred themes. &nbsp;I always like the pirates and castle sets as a kid and as an adult I&#39;ve stuck mostly with those and the expert line. I picked up this set because I fell in love with the sled dogs and had to have a team of them. &nbsp;If there had been a small set that was just a sled team I would have just bought that that and I would have really missed out.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: Normal broken down into very simple steps for younger builders.</p>

<p>Parts: lots of specialty pieces which is cool, loved all the orange.</p>

<p>Minifigures: OMG The puppies! The huskies are even better than I expected and the polar bear is awesome. &nbsp;I was also very happy to see that there was a female researcher included. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: Fairly simple, the tracked ice corer was fun, the center itself was trickier that I&nbsp;expected with the opening sides. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: The playabilty of this model is absolutely great. &nbsp;There are so many elements and little details. &nbsp;You can have a whole story unfold from this single set if you wanted too</p>

<p>Overall opinion: &nbsp;I was so pleasantly surprised by this set that I went out and bought 60062 to go with it. &nbsp;It was a nice build and I really thought the value was great. &nbsp;I would definitely suggest picking it up to any collector on the fence or to any parent looking for a set that will give their child a lot of play for their money. &nbsp;</p>

"mikemakesmusic","2015-04-28T23:36:29.82Z","Designed for playability","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Easy construction - 5 numbered instruction books with 8 numbered bags. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a few new parts to me. &nbsp;Not sure if they are new to LEGO or not. &nbsp;I like the polar bear and small dogs for the dogsled. &nbsp;The treads for the snowcat are fun; I&#39;ve not seen them before, but I think a couple of the Star Wars sets use these pieces. &nbsp;Clever design for the snow cat. &nbsp;A new to me conveyor belt is included, but it&#39;s more or less already assembled. &nbsp;The set simply attaches a few pieces to it to make it work with this design.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>GREAT colors and I really like the scientist. &nbsp;The fur lined hats are fun. &nbsp;Detailed printing all around. &nbsp;Really nice minifigs with this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>735 pieces, so it might feel a bit overwhelming for the very young, new LEGO builder, but the organization and instructions are laid&nbsp;out very clearly and are very easy to follow. &nbsp;The way to approach so many pieces is to ONLY open the bag(s) that each consecutive instruction book calls for. &nbsp;The set includes several different items and none are large. &nbsp;I believe young builders will gain a sense of achievement with each vehicle they build until they get to the station. &nbsp;The station is build in two distinct pieces and then fitted together at the very end. &nbsp;Don&#39;t shy away because of the parts count. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>FUN! &nbsp;High degree of playability and should spark the imagination at any age. &nbsp;;)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Recommended if playability is the thing. &nbsp;If a challenging build is the goal, look elsewhere.</p>

"Copycat","2020-06-21T20:31:14.617Z","A good set with 2 good builds and some mediocre","<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, the base building and the driller are great, fun, and easy to build, but the rest of the builds (helicopter, snowmobile, and dog sled) are small, pointless and bad builds adding to the price and piece count. Although it is the flagship set of the wave, it is not the most expensive, that title going to the 60062 Arctic Icebreaker, which is $130, as opposed to this set&#39;s $90 price point. I think they could&#39;ve made this set&#39;s price point anywhere from $100-$140, and included a better helicopter more like the one from 60034 Arctic Helicrane. I see room for improvement in the snowmobile too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the building age range is spot on, although that is an assumption because I built this set when I was older than 6. The build was easy and enjoyable, as are most city sets. One of the great things about city sets&nbsp;is how easy and enjoyable they are to build.</p>

<p>This set has some of the best parts I&#39;ve seen in a city set. Everything from the tracks, to the conveyer belt, to the huskies, to the polar bear, to the top of the base building commonly used as a fuselage on airplanes and helicopters and many more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think $90 is a fair price for what you get here. There may only be 733 pieces, but the size of the peices and build&nbsp;than make up for it.</p>
