"Frothycoffeeman","2015-01-27T22:04:11.533Z","A proper Technic toy","<p>I am amazed that this is the first review of this kit. I felt it necessary to right this wrong.</p>

<p>42029 Customised pick up truck is surely the most underrated technic kit of 2014. Sure there is nothing awesome or new but for actual bullet proof playability this is an absolute must have if you wish to brain wash your pre- decimal aged relatives. My 18 month old niece loves abusing it.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</p>

<p>Er... Biggish colourful box, accurate easy to follow instructions. no cardboard protection as is normal for this mid price kit. Stupid redneck style stickers.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Lots of parts! (see right panel for $ per piece).</p>

<p>Lots of red panels, nothing too new and exciting but I am burning through technics at the moment and it&#39;s all a bit of a blur. This is, I think the second cheapest way of collecting the universal joint linkage thingy that was in the Unimog. To my knowledge the cheapest is the 42005 Monster truck.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Simple but engaging, nothing too challenging, sticker application was the usual shenanigans for 43 year old myopia . Nicely hidden function switcher.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Its big, it&#39;s really really big. It&#39;s red, very red and really big. Piston movement, opening doors and bonnet, insane suspension, tilting truck bed, flakey flap and functional&nbsp;winch. Great steering and possibility of adding power functions but why would you? Did I mention that it&#39;s on the large side?</p>

<p>Overall opinion&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was my freebie in a 3 for 2 Argos offer and is probably the best of the bunch! It lives on the floor and is regularly kicked out of the way, its pushed down the stairs, it is manhandled and &nbsp;niece handled/drooled on and just sucks up the collective abuse although the roof lights might benefit from K-raggle.Very highly recommended.</p>

"AyCarrumba","2015-06-24T16:48:26.393Z","A great 4x4 with nice parts and playability","<p>I picked this set up seeing it at &pound;51 on Amazon. Mainly I wanted the independent suspension set up, but this looked like a nice set overall for the money.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Medium sized box and 2 stapled Instruction books both to build the main model. However my sticker set was loose in the box and crumpled between two bags! I never put stickers on the sets, but it&#39;s nice to have them... Lego, PLEASE routinely put stickers in with the instructions and just cardboard back them so they don&#39;t get destroyed in transit!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A good range of parts here - Independent rear suspension, 4 firm shocks (too firm for smaller models?) Independent front suspension that looks like it can be driven with the CV joints as well as steer so 4x4 capable, a diff, a clutch, nice wheels and loads of panels. A minor gripe is color quality control. Some of the reds are definitely off!</p>

<h3>Minifigures - None.</h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a straightforwards build but then I think everything is after 42009?? No surprises, but there are some nice features in there. I like the universal joints putting power to the rear bed and winch. The bodywork comes together pretty quickly (I find the bodywork and cosmetics a bit bring at the end of technic builds).</p>

<p>This is a really fun playable model. Suspension is firm and works well and the steering is good, although it lacks lock and has a surprisingly long wheelbase. It&#39;s also really big as you can see in my comparison next to the Volvo L350F front end loader and Mobile Crane MKII. There&#39;s lots of space in that chassis, and the model looks ready to be fully motorised by keen customisers. IT IS called the custom 4x4 after all!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set at the &pound;50 mark. It comes with loads of useful bits like the suspension components and is a solid model in it&#39;s own right with robust construction and good playability. Highly recommended when on sale. I am really looking forwards to building my on models using these pieces, it&#39;s the ideal base kit for compact motorised 4x4&#39;s so long as you have more diffs and CV joints ready to use!</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2018-11-11T04:07:36.6Z","Highly Playable and Robust Set","<p>I bought this set three and-a-half years ago at my local LEGO store. I remember it being a pretty good day what with me getting my university winter semester grades back and finding out I did quite well, being called for a job interview (which failed), as well as watching Avengers: Age of Ultron&nbsp;with my friends in the evening. No doubt there is a bit of sentiment attached to this set and I will always positively associate it with that day.</p>

<p>The set was released in 2014 so its shelf life was still pretty young when I took a liking to it. I watched YouTube reviews to corroborate&nbsp;the qualities I was expecting from this set. From the videos I made the conclusion that the Customized Pick-Up Truck seemed to fare better than similar size rugged/all-terrain vehicles from the past (such as 8297 Off-Roader and 8081 Extreme Cruiser). Of course, we have the 8466 4x4 Off-Roader from 2001 whose functionality has not been matched since, even to this day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build time was around 6-7 hours and at only a little more than a thousand pieces there were no particularly challenging parts of the build. We have the standard package of basic functions expected from such a set, which include working V-6 engine, hand-of-god steering, and 4-wheel independent suspension. The engine is connected only to&nbsp;the rear&nbsp;wheels, but the name of the set doesn&#39;t have &quot;4x4&quot; in it so one should not expect anything more. The suspension is fantastic, offering plenty of travel and providing the ideal amount of stiffness; it is loose enough to go over road bumps smoothly, but not so much as to sag under the weight of the vehicle.&nbsp;Pushing down on the roof of the vehicle will cause the springs to compress quite easily without having the entire vehicle bending from excessive resistance. Both front and rear springs are pre-compressed and have stops to prevent excessive travel.</p>

<p>A gearbox in the cab allows you to toggle between the two functions of this set: the winch and flatbed. The flatbed tips using a small linear actuator, and the back opens manually to allow for whatever load is being carried to be released. The winch reel winds and unwinds using a worm gear. Power functions are optional for these two functions and separate instructions allow you to fit them in quite easily if you wanted. The hood opens and hinges from the windshield which is more realistic compared to hinging from&nbsp;the front bumper, having been the case in many previous vehicles. The cab doors also open manually.</p>

<p>There is an interesting relationship between the winch mechanism and front suspension. Because the front suspension springs are precompressed, they push down on the winch mechanism. This causes the axle controlling the winch to rub against one of the holes it passes through and you can feel the friction when turning the winch. However, this isn&#39;t much of a problem as it doesn&#39;t impair function of the winch.</p>

<p>The steering has a lot of backlash and the wheels aren&#39;t entirely parallel with one another when you steer. Rolling and steering at the same time improves the situation but you can clearly see that the wheels don&#39;t always align when dry steering.</p>

<p>Unlike some, I honestly don&#39;t mind the proportions of the vehicle, again this was meant to be a heavily playable set so I can understand if the designers opted for a rugged design. There are a few stickers which illustrate a roaring bear and decorative claw marks on the hood to highlight toughness.</p>

<p>To conclude, this pick up truck was remarkably well done and highly playable. I believe it was $120 CAD at the time which in my opinion&nbsp;was a good deal. In the past couple years I&#39;ve bought several Technic sets but I&#39;m redirecting my focus back to System. These days not a lot of Technic sets catch my attention but pneumatics are always a welcome breath of fresh air.</p>
