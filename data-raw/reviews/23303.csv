"ajmk","2014-08-03T23:08:01.38Z","Another solid (literally) flagship set","<p>It&#39;s the beginning of August which means.... this year&#39;s Technic flagship is released. When I saw what this year&#39;s set was, probably sometime back in March, I have to admit I wasn&#39;t filled full of excitement. After the lovely surprise of the Cargo Plane, another construction vehicle. And one that we have a previous (reasonably recent) version of too, 8265.&nbsp;And I will now have a hundred million yellow beams.&nbsp;Pfff.</p>

<p>Still, sometimes looks can be deceiving, and as I have&nbsp;said in a previous&nbsp;review about Technic flagships, I was pretty much always going to get this set. It&#39;s expensive - I&nbsp;winced slightly as I parted with 170 pounds (OK, 161.50 with VIP discount) at the Discovery Store in Manchester on Saturday.&nbsp;The pleasant shop assistant made me feel better though&nbsp;by asking &quot;is this for you?&quot; - &quot;yes :)&quot; I replied, smile included. There are few better arguments, it seems to me, for getting&nbsp;an education and a good job&nbsp;than being able to buy the biggest Lego sets....</p>

<p>Anyway, sorry, let me tell you something about the set! In-keeping with the price, the box is big, much deeper than the usual boxes. When you open it of course it is not full, but there are lots of bags in there, some big tyres and that enormous bucket, which I think I read is the biggest element Technic has ever had. Wow, it is big - put it next to a minifigure!&nbsp;You also have a whole bunch of power functions stuff:&nbsp;battery box;&nbsp;one each of the four&nbsp;different motors;&nbsp;two remote controls and&nbsp;two IR receivers. There are&nbsp;three linear actuators. I dare say that those parts I just listed account for most of the cost of the set. You get tons&nbsp;of yellow beams, surprisingly few gears, lots of axles, and the portal axle assemblies too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">At 1600-something pieces, this set is a lot&nbsp;smaller in piece count than last year&#39;s flagship, but when you have all the pieces out on your desk, you do still feel like you have bought a lot of pieces, and piece count isn&#39;t everything anyway, as we all know.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;""><img alt="""" src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8Y1Tvusfr40/U98wPT6PlPI/AAAAAAAABwk/eImL7cMjyUE/s640/blogger-image--1625723055.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also of course the sticker sheet, which I won&#39;t use, as usual. The instruction book (yes, singular, book) is one of the ones with lots of pages and a spine - can&#39;t remember the last time we got one of those, a welcome sight rather than the 3 or so thinner books we&#39;ve had recently. And I really love that Lego now put the books in bags with a cardboard sheet. I used to despair at the book and sticker sheet being all mangled in the box! Thank heaven those days are over.</p>

<p>On to the build then: it&#39;s great. Not as long as some of the other flagship sets, but strangely I liked this. It&#39;s still a good 4 or 5 hours including unboxing and everything. There are no really tricky bits, and no particularly complicated steps which I suppose is a shame. The build is also slightly weighted towards form rather than function, meaning that there are a lot of steps that make the model look nice as opposed to simply working. You can take that both ways though - sometimes it&#39;s nice to put some effort into having it look right. It&#39;s very satisfying seeing how the motors fit into the model - they&#39;re not all mounted in the way you might expect, and there&#39;s stuff too to get your head around that makes the model work. All the way through you are struck by how solid this model is - I guess it has to be to cope with the forces needed to move a good fraction of the weight of the model with the servo motor for steering. Probably it will be hard on the fingers to take to pieces but that&#39;s worth it, always.</p>

<p>I like the green engine blocks - usually I find building the engine the worst bit of these models, but because of the new colour&nbsp;it seemed altogether new, like I hadn&#39;t actually put one of these engines together a thousand times and could almost do it in my sleep ;) I am also now pretty much convinced that Lego have tried hard to avoid being too tedious with symmetrical builds. This model has a few bits where you are building the &#39;other side&#39; but it doesn&#39;t feel like you&#39;re repeating something. I like that a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you get it finished, you are struck by what a beast of a model this is. It&#39;s heavy, and big. That&#39;s really satisfying. Looking at it on my desk now, I&#39;m happy I bought it. Last year&#39;s Crane MkII&nbsp;is awesome, but this year&#39;s is awesome in a slightly different way. It&#39;s impressively solid. I love it. The wheels and bucket are massive. Did I say that already? Well, they are :)</p>

<p>The remote control functions are great fun too - having two controls and the fact that the functions are arranged sensibly between them means that you can drive it properly, and when you want, operate the bucket properly, both functions at once. I spent a good while just doing n-point turns on my desk top and trying to scoop things up in the bucket.</p>

<p>Next to 8265 there is no contest - this thing is amazing. At some point I&nbsp;will probably build them both&nbsp;and put them side by side like I did with the Mobile Cranes, but I already know what the outcome will be. 42030 is awesome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I rated this set 4 overall even though while writing this review I felt like I wanted to give it 5. I think it&#39;s expensive, but then you do get all the power functions stuff. There are no really new pieces, but then the exception&nbsp;is the new massive bucket. It&#39;s not the most complicated Technic model ever, nor is it particularly difficult or challenging to build, but then it is so heavy and big, and the remote functions and play value are excellent.&nbsp;I&#39;ll give it 4.5.</p>

"FlagsNZ","2015-02-01T07:12:55.537Z","Buy this set for the serious selection of remote Power Functions","<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This </span>Volvo L350F Wheel Loader&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Technic set represents the most expensive Technic set to date, however do not get too confused with the price per piece calculations.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The set is loaded with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Power-Functions"">Power Functions</a>, has three <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4638507"">large linear actuators</a>, the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4610381"">largest wheels</a> in the LEGO range and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6055632"">largest Technic part yet created</a>.</span></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a Flagship Technic set for 2014. It comes in a huge box.</p>

<p>LEGO has started printing instructions complete in one book. This set&#39;s instructions come in one 323 page book. The book binding is an improvement but personally, I am not sure having one book&nbsp;is a good move. I have enjoyed building&nbsp;Technic sets in stages and having instructions in several books assists this.</p>

<p>There is a sticker sheet. There are stickers for the main set as well as a couple of unique stickers&nbsp;for the second model, the <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16.5px; line-height: 24px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">articulated A25F Volvo Hauler. I tend not to apply stickers to my sets though.</span></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>By my guess, about half the set&#39;s cost is taken up with all the Power Functions components.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7412/16414328391_83387aac14_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The set comes with four motors; one&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4506083"">M Motor</a>, one&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6000564"">L Motor</a>, one&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4506081"">XL Motor</a>&nbsp;and one&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6000566"">Servo Motor</a>. These motors are controlled remotely through two&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6034989"">IR Remote Controls</a>&nbsp;and two&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6040157"">IR Receivers</a>&nbsp;and powered with one&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4506078"">9V Battery Box</a>.</p>

<p>As I believe that these parts account for half of the cost&nbsp;(&pound;85 / $125 / &euro;110). The remaining price per piece becomes 5.231p / 7.692c / 6.769c.</p>

<p>As all the functions of this model are driven by individual motors which are&nbsp;controlled remotely, there is no gear box to be found. I was surprised at how few gears are included in this set of this size.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8577/16414328741_dbb15e4c9b_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Seeing how much space is saved by avoiding the need for a gear box has shown me how <a href=""http://jurgenstechniccorner.com/"">Jurgen&nbsp;Krooshoop</a>&nbsp;managed to build the ultimate <a href=""http://www.jurgenstechniccorner.com/instructions/Ultimate42009.pdf"">remote controlled Mobile Crane 42009</a>.</p>

<p>Purchasing&nbsp;this set will provide you with most of the parts, particularly the Power Functions parts, required for the 42009 MOC.</p>

<p>I swapped an&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6019910"">IR-Speed-Remote</a> in lieu of the supplied&nbsp;IR Remote Control and ensured that the XL Motor and Servo Motor were&nbsp;controlled by the IR Speed Remote. This modification&nbsp;will give you finer&nbsp;control of the model&#39;s speed and steering.</p>

<p>I have witnessed the evolution of Technic construction from fully brick built sets to the modern studless look. This set has very few regular studded bricks,&nbsp;plates and tiles.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7394/16414328151_a7dc431134_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a solid set with substantial&nbsp;multi-directional reinforcing. It will take about the same time to dismantle as it does to build it.</p>

<p>Set aside a couple of days to build this model up and at least one day needs to be set aside should you want to dismantle it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Both the&nbsp;L350F Wheel Loader and the articulated&nbsp;A25F&nbsp;Hauler are very accurately represented by this set. The remote controls operate smoothly on both models however this is improved if an&nbsp;IR-Speed Remote is used.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8586/15796039163_c76a0cbae4_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would have preferred&nbsp;some functions being operated using gear boxes. It would have made this more like a real world machine than a large remote controlled toy.</p>

<p>This view does not distract from the fact that this is an impressive LEGO Technic set.</p>

<p>I will be using all the specialised parts in building MOCs and am looking forward to attempting the ultimate remote controlled mobile crane.</p>

"asuss2812","2015-08-26T21:20:45.453Z","Need-to-have for every LEGO Technic fan","<p>I became owner of this set around 3 months ago, bought it as new. Volvo matches my collection of yellow building machines.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is big, although parts could be easily placed in smaller one, but it wouldn&#39;t have made such impression. Instruction is stretched in one thick book.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Of course, as a Technic model, none, but you can easily put it in driver cabin and it quite good fits.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A little bit challenging, not as much as 8110 or 42043, especially the 4-wheel-drive system, as the drive shaft is made of pretty much bricks. Handling the chassis while building was problematic, as the main joint was not stable (before mounting the actuator). I had the greatest satisfaction while putting completed engine to the body. I think it was the best part of the build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It presents great in the showcase. Honestly, resemblance to real Volvo L350F is high. Playing is little bit hard, as the actuator works 0-1 way, so think about buying speed-control pilot after buying this set. The chassis aft should be stabilized. Also, the battery box has to be already connected with few bricks to be connected to rig, so putting it out is little bit painstaking.</p>

<p>ps. what a pity there is not central differential :(</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all, it is great, licensed set which can give huge amount of joy to every lego fan. If you got few bucks - go and buy it!</p>

"pinz","2018-02-09T23:10:22.617Z","A great set","<p>The Volvo Wheel Loader is a great set, literaly. The wheels are the same size like those used in in the Unimog. It has quite some power (functions). Also there are nice details in the A-model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To play with the set is fun, only the steering with the technic remotes is not realy&nbsp;finegraded, even if the servo would support it, but this a issue of the remote. You can use the big shovel like the real vehicle&nbsp;would. And with the L-motor for the movement you have enough power to overcome even some obstacles.</p>

<p>The building experience is nice, only the beams for the shovel need some care. the black angled technic beams are similar, so you have to be careful at assembling them. Overall you spend some enjoyable hours during you put together the pieces and see this massive beast grow and take shape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are clever used and the big black shovel is a really big and &quot;massive&quot; part for a Lego set. The first time a actually&nbsp;had it in hand was a real wow-moment.<br />
There are also a nice range of motors and 2 IR-remotes.</p>

<p>The B-model lacks a bit this love of details, the original truck for instance has 6 wheels, but in the set you have only 4, also the bed is a mere outline, like in the old days.</p>
