<p><strong>THIS IS A REVIEW OF THE PRIMARY MODEL. THE SECONDARY MODELS WILL NOT BE REVIEWED</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roaring Power is a simple sports car, complete with opening hood/trunk, seats and steering wheel and special hubcaps. It plays its role very well as a sports car. The building experience is fairly simple and the parts choice is good. The hubcaps look sporty, but this is where we run into my first complaint.</p>

<p>The wheels, as realistic as they may look,&nbsp;<strong>do not like to turn!</strong>&nbsp;The wheels have friction somewhere and tend to jam themselves, severely limiting the playability!</p>

<p>The doors look real and are hinged in the middle. Inside, you will find white colored seats and a tan dashboard, complete with a steering wheel. The trans-dark grey windshield fits in well with the cars overall theme, but it makes me skeptical about visibility, affecting the realism.</p>

<p>The front of the car contains the opening trunk. I say trunk because the inside is bare, making me think that the car is mid-engined. The trans-yellow pieces for the headlights are separate, with the Bionicle eye piece being&nbsp;connected to a technic piece with a tan pin, which is clearly visible from the side, making it seem awkward. The grille has trans-blue pieces representing fog-lights which are in a realsitic place.</p>

<p>The rear of the car uses trans-red pieces as tail-lights, again connected with a technic pin. 2 central exhaust pipes add to the theme while the white medium-level spoiler completes the overall package.</p>

<p>All in all its a good set. Minor complaints annoy me a bit, but i would recommend this set for every LEGO fan!</p>
