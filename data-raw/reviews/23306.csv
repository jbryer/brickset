I call it a &quot;mini modular&quot; set and this is the kind of kit that every city builder can benefit from. The price is also good (US$ 90 for a 1023 pieces set). It comes with three minifigs and the main model consists of two commercial buildings: a Bike Shop and a Cafe. Both are two floor buildings with a terrace. The set also comes with a car.</p>

<h3>Bike Shop:</h3>

<p>Internally the Bike Shop is simpler in the first floor and looks like a garage with tools, a back entrance with a ramp and a showcase where you can place the bike. The second floor is a one-room apartment with a sink, stove, drawers and bed. The terrace has a ladder access with diagonal doors.</p>

<p>Externally the Bike Shop is an elegant building with nicely built windows and a plant pot by the sidewalk.</p>

<h3>Cafe:</h3>

<p>Internally the Cafe has a coffee machine, pastries on a balcony and a table close to a big window with blue curtains. There is a nice chandelier and a back door. The second floor of the Cafe, a small apartment with an end table, a table lamp and a chair, is accessible externally through stairs located in the back of the building. Although small, this apartment has a balcony. The Cafe also has a terrace with a trapdoor that connects with the apartment.</p>

<p>The Cafe has more external details. There is a table with a chair in the front, an identification sign with a coffee cup in one side and a pastry in the other, an ATM by the side of the building and the stairs in the back with a water tap below it.</p>

<p>I particularly like the way the windows are built in both buildings. This set has no stickers.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>- Elegant and beautiful buildings with a good level of internal and external details.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; Very useful for city building.</p>

<p>- Good price (US$ 90 for a 1023 pieces set).</p>

<p>- The two buildings can be put side by side in a modular fashion.</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<p>- The set comes with a one-seat yellow car that does not match the overall style of the buildings.</p>

<p>- The exterior chair of the cafe is also yellow and does not match the overall style because of the color (I used a brown chair from my personal collection instead).</p>

<p>- The balcony door in the second floor of the cafe opens to the inside and has no handle in the outside making it impossible to close from the outside. I used a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4514195"">60849</a> grey nozzle from my personal collection placed vertically as external handle and it works and looks good.</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a good set and I&#39;m thinking about buying at least one more to expand the buildings or to build the alternative models.</p>

I had no interest in it prior to that, but once I started building, I&#39;m glad I took the plunge. The new creator styled buildings add in some smaller scaled flair to any city. While, they don&#39;t fit in with the rest of the Modular line, they do allow you to either create your own mini city or use as a starting point for a larger building, which is what I did.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- A lot of great pieces. At 1023 pieces, it allows you some room to create your own designs or follow the instructions. It has some interesting looking A models, while the B and C models aren&#39;t too bad either. I ended up modifying mine a bit to keep the color scheme more consistent. (Essentially switching the top halves of the two A models with each other.)</p>

<p>- Some fun &quot;play&quot; features. The ATM machine is neat enough. I like the curtains on the cafe.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; The decorative elements work quite well. But this can also be a CON as I will describe in that section.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- Same figures reused again and again.</p>

<p>- Small car. It works, but the scale seems off compared to everything else LEGO does anymore. But it fits for Creator style I suppose.</p>

<p>- Decorative elements, while look nice, are rehashed in a lot of sets also. The modified plate with upwards hook and the upside down cone is used in many sets. While this looks good here (and in the other sets), it seems LEGO designers like to reuse it too often.</p>

<p>- The mix-matched color scheme seems weird considering you could swap the top two floors and make it look more cohesive.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>As you can see above, most of my &quot;faults&quot; are related to simple fixes you can do on your own. For a set worth it&#39;s value, I&#39;d say pick this up. You can either modify it or display it. It will work quite well in either situation.</p>

The build was amazing, Lots of brickbuilding, and some nice shaping all the way through. I like the minifigure selection, they&#39;re simple, but they do just fine, and all of them can be anything you want in this set. Plus I loved this &quot;mini modular&quot; idea that lego had for a while, It was really good.</p>
