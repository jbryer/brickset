At the risk of underselling a review of an average set, read on to find out why...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box shows an action shot of the model, as well as highlighting &lsquo;the mission&rsquo;, which apparently involves a computer chip &ndash; quite charming in a late-1990s kind of way... I don&#39;t have the app, so am unable to say how well this ties in with the online world. The instructions are straightforward and clear, set against a blue/grey background, and are framed by a range finder sight style boarder, in keeping with the spy-tech theme.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing particularly spectacular about the parts &ndash; there&rsquo;s a good variety in dark tan (including plates, slopes and dishes) but, with only 241 pieces in total, none come in any great quantity that would make&nbsp;this set a great parts pack. There&rsquo;s also a sprinkling of technic arms and pin connectors which are used primarily for the fist-punch mechanism. The two rubber caterpillar tracks were new to me, and look and feel appropriately chunky and solid.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two minifigures included are Tremor, the villain of the piece, and someone the internet informs me is called Agent Jack Fury. Both feature incredibly detailed and intricate printing on both the front and back of the torsos. This is slightly wasted on Tremor as most of the torso is covered up with a shiny helmet and upper body armour one-piece, but fortunately there is no less detail in the design as it continue down the front of the legs.</p>

<p>Like Hayden Christensen they are blessed with two expressions apiece &ndash; Mr Fury gets determined concentration, as well as a smug sneer. Tremor is harder to read as a red visor covers the upper section of his face, so I&rsquo;m calling one face &lsquo;frustrated anger&rsquo;, while the other one looks like he&rsquo;s holding back tears. Or incontinence.</p>

<p>Tremor also gets some amusingly proportioned fist pieces which makes him look like the man whose touch turns everything into Skittles has finally snapped and gone bad.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly uncomplicated &ndash; starting with six quick steps to build the &lsquo;secure&rsquo; unit which stores the computer chip Tremor appears to be after. Onto the main vehicle, and there are no tricksy or interesting techniques on display, though the variety of plate layering at the front and back, which are then connected down the sides could be a useful starter lesson in basic Lego geometry for younger builders (three plates = one brick etc).</p>

<p>There are numerous stickers, most of which are on a transparent background so be sure to position them carefully as peeling them away to re-apply does then show up! Also, the sticker placed on a 1x2 cheese slope near the beginning is incredibly fiddly for anyone with adult fingers &ndash; best get your child to help you with that bit if you can (that must be why it says &lsquo;Age 7-12&rsquo; on the box&hellip;).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished tank is sturdy in construction and the tracks work well on hard surfaces, though the inverted slope pieces which give the model a pointy look at the back and front also reduce the ground clearance to the extent that Agent Fury could easily scupper Tremor&rsquo;s nefarious plans by placing the computer chip across a medium pile carpet.</p>

<p>The computer chip holder itself is fairly disposable &ndash; it does the job with a minimum number of pieces.</p>

<p>The mechanism to control the giant fists is simple but effective, and you can also just about grab Agent Fury using the giant fingers. The tracks and wheels look good and, as they are recessed, help give a bulkier look to the vehicle. There are a couple of the obligatory flick-fire missiles for added play value and a large aerial for . . . well, I have no idea, but it looks good.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is . . . ok, I suppose, though I&rsquo;ve never seen a tank that is quite so unable to negotiate even mildly bumpy terrain. The large cartoon fists lend a certain goofy &lsquo;cartoon villain&rsquo; charm &ndash; it&rsquo;s not too difficult to imagine Adam West&rsquo;s Batman facing down something similar, all in glorious 1960s technicolor&hellip;</p>

<p>However, by itself it&rsquo;s rather unexciting, beyond driving it around the floor and repeatedly punching Agent Fury in the face. Combined with other sets, I imagine it could be good fun, perhaps even &lsquo;infiltrating&rsquo; the City theme and punching a hole through the front of the police station, rampaging around, destroying buildings etc.</p>

<p>So to a rather harsh conclusion &ndash; this is probably the worst of the first Ultra Agents wave. That&rsquo;s not to be too disparaging as in my opinion the theme has been a pleasant surprise in both design and playability. The other 2014 sets have set the bar high, so it&rsquo;s only in comparison with these that this manages to feel mildly disappointing &ndash; especially when you can get <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70162-1/Infearno-Interception"">70162 Infearno Interception</a> for only a little more, which feature similarly well designed minifigures, and has the bonus of a hugely more appealing vehicle. Maybe one for a &ldquo;theme completest&rdquo; only.</p>

Building it was meh not bad but really not good at all i would say 2 but how quick it was makes it a 3. stickers are okay... (they&#39;re still stickers so yeah it annoying and bad but i get why we have them). I don&#39;t play much but i see why it could be fun i like it this is something you should think about a little more before buying it i would recommend but be cautious its a big matter of opinion.</p>

"Gridlock007","2019-02-06T16:06:10.493Z","Tremor Track Infiltration","<p>This is a very underrated set from an underrated theme. The set comes with 241 pieces, a good deal for $19.99. A fun set, and the minfigs are very detailed. Tremor is especially cool. The main build looks cool and is a nice plaything, but&nbsp;is very flimsy. The secondary build comes with a nice printed translucent green brick. overall, It is really cool.</p>
