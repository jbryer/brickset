<p>This is a very cool lego&nbsp;set, and it is well worth your money. It comes with 2 minifigs: Solomon Blaze and Infearno, a flame-powered hoverboard, and an awesome convertible car!</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>Solomon Blaze is a retired galaxy squad member who is now the leader of the ultra agents. He has a double sided face, his default face being his angry/determined face and his second face being a happy smirk. You can tell he has some injuries by the big scar on his head and his amputated leg. He is wearing a black tuxedo with the ultra agents logo on it, and a golden tie underneath. He carries one of the new 2014 blasters.</p>

<p>Infearno&nbsp;is the villain of the set, terrorizing the people of Astor City. He has some pretty detailed printing on his torso, but it is unfortunately covered up by his&nbsp;flamethrower suit. Infearno is a large minifig, and he is made up of almost 20 pieces! He carries a bundle of dynamite in each hand. His flaming&nbsp;helmet is a brand new piece for this set.&nbsp;Infearno flies around the city on his flame-powered hoverboard, which has only 8 pieces!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now for the main part of the set, Solomon Blaze&#39;s convertible car. Unlike most cars, this one has bigger wheels on the front than on the back. The front wheels do not use normal wheel pieces, but instead use transparent&nbsp;radar dishes. The back wheels are made with normal wheel pieces, but use smaller transparent radar dish pieces on the front of them to make a cool effect. The wheels fold in to activate hover mode. There are dual laser cannons on each side of the car, and two more lasers on the front. In the cockpit, there is a printed control panel and an ejector&nbsp;seat. To launch the ejector seat, you open up the cockpit and press the red button on the back of the car. On the back there is also a pair of hidden spring-loaded shooters that you can lift up and fire. The car rolls nicely on carpet, but not so much on flat surfaces.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Has awesome minifigs</p>

<p>-Has useful parts</p>

<p>-Has two cool vehicles</p>

<p>-Has great playability</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-No good place to store Solomon&#39;s blaster</p>

<p>-Doesn&#39;t roll well on flat surfaces</p>

<p>Overall, this is an awesome set that is worth every penny. Hope my review was helpful for you!</p>

"Bobsy","2014-10-12T12:58:58.173Z","Something a little different for Sci-Fi Fans","<p>It&#39;s very sci-fi, isn&#39;t it? And that seems like a strange thing to say, since LEGO has been selling spaceships since the 1970s. But despite this, Infearno Interception (which is a <em>terrible</em> set name, by the way) has a uniquely sci-fi look that is something of a departure for official Lego sets. It brings to mind the future-asthetic of movies such as Minority Report, Blade Runner and, yes, TRON. We&#39;ll get to that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<h3>Parts</h3>
</p>

<p>Nothing to get especially excited about, although the presence of lots of transparent light blue is noteworthy, especially around the wheels. There are also two silver flexible hoses and a fancy spoiler at the back.</p>

<p>The only truly unique piece is Infearno&#39;s headwear, a transparent orange/red piece to set his head on fire. Perfect for custom minifigs for the Human Torch or Ghost Rider, or setting any other small piece alight. It&#39;s a fun little piece, but hardly worth the price if the rest of the set doesn&#39;t appeal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The &#39;hero&#39;, agent Solomon Blaze (hnng) is pretty basic. Suit, tie, grey hair, a small amount of printing on his right leg - presumably it&#39;s at least part robotic. Not only is this pretty dull overall, but the suit jacket is emblazoned with the Ultra Agents logo, which is a problem for re-using it on a civilian. Unimpressive.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the eponymous Infearno, stupidly named though he is, makes up for Solomon&#39;s tediousness. Along with the fiery headpiece (see above), Infearno wears a red version of the Galaxy Patrol armour introduced with the series 7 collectable minifigures line. This covers up an excellent torso print which shows a blazing furnace within Infearno&#39;s body. The armour also has a pair of brick-built napalm canisters and attached flamethrowers, completing Infearno&#39;s supervillainous look.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There&#39;s little to challenge most builders here. Everything comes together smoothly, with the only slightly infuriating part being attaching the flexible hoses, which might wind up young builders for a while. But this is a minor consideration - the rest of the build is hassle-free.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When the dust settles, the set provides the main vehicle as well as Infearno&#39;s jetpowered surfboard.</p>

<p>The latter is... disappointing. The board often comes detached from the jet engine below, and the nose of the engine seems unfinished. Added to this, while Infearno is a well-designed figure, he seems unsuited to the surfboard. His armour essentially points him front-on towards everything he faces, but the board requires its rider to be side-on. Perhaps some other sort of transport would be more suitable? A Segway, perhaps?</p>

<p>But that&#39;s the only real gripe with this set. The car itself is something to behold. Primarily black, the silver and transparent light blue highlights prevent it looking too dull. The massive front wheels are somewhat reminiscent of the Tumbler from the Christopher Nolan Batman films, and suggests that at an early stage this might have been a concept model for a minifig-scale Tumbler.</p>

<p>Regardless, what it has become is pretty wonderful. It evokes a long history of urban sci-fi movies and art which LEGO has thus far left untouched. The smooth arcing curve of the vehicle is very Minority Report, and the almost-neon blue accents definitely bring TRON to mind (both the recent movie and the 1980s classic).</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the front wheels are entirely brick-built, with no tires or purpose-made hubcaps. Indeed, before assembling the model I wasn&#39;t entirely sure the wheels would turn at all. Pleasingly, they do, but with no rubber tires, they have trouble getting enough traction to spin on a hard surface like a table or desk. It also doesn&#39;t help that all four wheels can be rotated outwards for a sort of hover-mode, but it looks so utterly naff that it&#39;s only worth mentioning for the irritation this causes in trying to get all the wheels turning simultaneously on a hard surface.</p>

<p>Other play features? Spring-fire missiles hidden in the back of the vehicle and a neat little ejector seat for Solomon to pop out in. Hardly exciting, but fun little additions nonetheless.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is the flagship set of the Ultra Agents line, being affordable but not too small, having the most striking looks of all the &#39;good-guy&#39; vehicles, and with enough play features to keep kids happy. It&#39;s also the most definitive statement of the aesthetic style of the Ultra Agents as a blend of contemporary and futuristic elements into a cyberpunk-esque sci-fi look. It looks great, it plays well with plenty for kids to enjoy, and it matches up well with both Space and City lines.</p>

<p>Essentially, if you buy only one Ultra Agents set, it probably should be this one. Not for nothing is the style being revisited for 2015&#39;s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70167-1/Invizable-Gold-Getaway"">Invisable Gold Getaway</a>.</p>

"JoeJones","2014-10-29T20:42:20.25Z","Definitely more than meets the eye","<p>I bought this set after going through a Lego Catalogue&nbsp;wondering what to spend my money on. As a fan of the previous Lego Agents series from 2008 this theme looked different and this set caught my eye. Infearno&nbsp;and his flaming hover board looked cool and as the set was a reasonable price &nbsp;I bought the set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is made from a thicker cardboard than others I have bought prior to this set. The back of the box advertises the free interactive story app and the functions that the set includes for playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are made from the usual paper so nothing new here. There is another advert for the free app toward the back. The instructions are fairly easy to follow as the pieces for each step are shown in the box above the image.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>When I opened the 2 numbered bags I noticed that the set contained 313 pieces which was a good amount for the RRP of &pound;24.99. I was pleased to see that there were some printed parts. Then I discovered the sheet of 5 stickers which annoyed me as I would rather have printed rather than stickered bricks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set contains 2 minifigures&nbsp;one of which is exclusive to that set (Infearno). Both of the figures had new printing on the head,&nbsp;torso and legs. Solomon Blaze is the only one to have printing on the back of the head.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building the model was relatively easy until it came to adding the pipe parts on the side. I had to squash the ends of the pipes slightly to allow it to bend around the pin and fit to the parts properly without popping off.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looked hugely better than expected and the functions also exceeded&nbsp;my expectations of them. The car can fit in my custom built cit which is great and Infearno fits in with the previous Lego Agents villains.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<h3><font face=""Noto Sans, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"" size=""3"">This set is a great one and Lego has done an amazing job here. The only problem I have is with the stud shooters that are with every set. I am more of a designer than a person who plays with it like it shows on the box.</font></h3>

"JerdaFoks","2015-11-05T01:13:10.547Z","Harkening Back to the Good Ol' Days","<p>This is my first time reviewing Legos despite them having practically made up the majority of my childhood experience. That said, now as an independent adult with disposable income, I&#39;m purchasing them myself and eager to embrace this side of Lego fandom. So, here we go.</p>

<p>I bought this set on a whim while wandering Toys R Us one drab weekend. It had effectively been two and a half years since I&#39;d mussed about with Legos, but I figured the set would be a nice nostalgic indulgence to shear off some of the day&#39;s stagnancy. Now with as many sets as I have in a time span my eleven year old self would have deemed ludicrous, I dare say it more than succeeded.</p>

<p>The set itself embodied a commonly echoed complaint that I assumed would ensure this purchase to be a one note fancy: price for size/enjoyment. (For the record, I judge sets in this area not by raw piece count or variety, but by the utilization of those pieces.) And despite thoroughly enjoying the construction process itself, what with the variety of new parts I had not seen; as the body of the car began coming together in shape and scale, I felt my apprehensions being justified. That was until I actually&nbsp;<em>held</em>&nbsp;the finished set (boyish glee over the rotating wheels aside: more on that in a moment). My conclusion over this issue is that Lego has sacrificed size for density and durability. Granted, that increased density is likely due most to the equally increased use of vertical stud benches, but I never felt that I could have chucked an older set of this price point across the room with any confidence of it staying together. This car more than gives me that feeling.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned before, the hover vehicle transformation made me a giddy goof ball for a good while and seems to be exmplery&nbsp;of how new Lego are designing action components. The friction/resistance system in place to reposition the wheels is neither obtuse with out of place parts nor sacrificing form for function. This design is something I appreciate both as an adult and looking back to what my younger self would have wanted. Making each moving part of the set independent lets play fell less directed and more open, with even the tail end of the spring missiles ostensibly looking like they could be boost afterburn. The set handles well from a play standpoint and the smooth rounds on the bottom are a clever and nice addition to prevent the front wheel assemblies from taking weight they were never designed to support. I won&#39;t go into the decal (sticker, whatever you want to call it) debate right now, as my opinion in that department almost deserves an independent post.</p>

<p>Instead, I&#39;ll move to my last bit to review (and honestly one I&#39;ve never had as much enthusiasm for when compared to what I perceive in the general community): the minifigs. Oh yeah, and the hoverboard too. The villian&nbsp;figure is most definitely a highlight of the set, minifigure&nbsp;enthusiast or not, but I feel he is marred by several aspects that go in direct contrast to the feeling of open play provided by the car. First, while both the armor piece and chest print are fantastic, the former conceals the latter and also makes turning the head even with the flame helmet off, a chore. The addition of the fuel pack and flame throwers adds to feel of the character (giving off a strong vibe of the flamethrower Hydra soldiers from the first Captain America film), their limited orientation does limit play options. The hoverboard for this minifig&nbsp;is something nice and simple and definitely evokes the kind of creativity I had in my youth building my own hoverboards&nbsp;with many similar parts. To see such a budget design pull off so appealing an aesthetic is a definitive plus to an already great set. And lastly is the older agent figure. I really appreciate the inclusion of what is clearly a more aged character as there are very few such minifigures in the unlicensed Lego world. Having a mentor for the younger characters in whatever world can be imagined is a nice touch and pulls the set together quite neatly.</p>

<p>As a final word, I definitely can recommend this to everyone. The complete set and building experience are solid and despite exhibiting many new Lego techniques, it still manages to carry that older charm I thought had been lost either by my own age or new developments from TLG. As a re-introduction to this fantastic landscape, this set takes full marks.</p>
