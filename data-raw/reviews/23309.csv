<p>The instructions are really small and durable, so i like that. But there is no need for 2 booklets.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>Awesome! Retox espically. He has a trans bright greed head! Toxikita&nbsp;is also cool. She has the exculsive bright green hair, like on my Ann Lee and Pixal. Nothing much for The Scientist, but Curtis Bolt has awesome accsories! 10/10 on figs!!!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part selection was problay the second best thing about this set, first being the completed models. Awesome use of an old bionicle shooter, and bright orange! Also alot of trans flourscent green! 10/10!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very interesting, unlike any other. 9/10!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Beautiful! You can move the hands on the lab by turning knobs at the back, you can turn the glass screen and play with the sattelite. The Helicopter has 1 Feature - You squeeze in 2 Lime Green Handles and drop Green Zamor Spheres put of the back. I think that is AWESOME! 10/10 on playability and complete model!</p>

The box was a nice size to fit all of the parts, unlike some boxes which were up to half empty. The stickers included help the way the build looks, and there aren&#39;t too many of them.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts- This set came with a pretty nice selection of parts. I like the (not-so) new shield piece, as well as the good selection of neon yellow and translucent green parts.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures- The minifigures in this set were amazing. The new Ultra Agent, named Curtis Bolt, was pretty nice looking. I love his armor pieces. He also comes with one of the new stud shooters, something that&#39;s all too rare in this wave of sets. Toxikita is a nice minifigure too. Where have you seen her before? For those Ninjago fans out there, you may recognize her as one of the competitors in the Tournament of Elements. Anyways, she isn&#39;t bad. The hair piece is a new addition in green, I believe. Adam Acid is OK too. He has a nice hat in brown, as well as a few cool translucent green parts. The Hazmat Suit guy is great, almost as good as Curtis Bolt.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build- The build took me about 40&nbsp;minutes to complete, but I&#39;m a pretty fast builder. I&#39;d say it would take about 50-60 minutes for the average person. It was pretty fun, though the last few steps were confusing. Not much repetition, and the color differentiation was fine.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model- I personally like this model very much.&nbsp;There are numerous play functions for kids, and the helicopter is easy for little ones to swoosh around in the air. Many different scenes can be created.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion- I&#39;d give this set a 4.5, pretty good. There is a pretty good parts selection, the minifigures are amazing, and the build is enjoyable. Even older fans will find it hard to resist playing with this set occasionally. Overall: great.</h3>
