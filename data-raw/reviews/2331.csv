"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-20T05:27:23Z","The Coolest Harry Potter's Castle ever!","This is a fabulous castle compared to the previous model 4709.

The colour of the building is really nice: dark gray at the bottom, then light gray, tan for the second level and it's either sand green (cone-shaped roof) or dark gray (sloped roof). It's such an improvement, unlike the 4709 with all-mixed-up colours.

The 'clock tower + raising gate' mechanism is cool. I'm not a technic fan but I really like this one.

The moving stairs are nice (way much better than the spiralcase stairs of 4709). There are even two beds inside the tower. There are a lot of windows too.

I like the two dementors and the new uniform as well. The only thing that i dislike about this set is the two big spider webs at the front. Perhaps LEGO can come out with other ideas for Harry Potter series 4.

Last but not least, the whole Harry Potter series 3 is cool especially when you place them on the carpet of Harry Potter (a free gift at LEGO exclusive shop with every purchase of 4709, 4729, 4756 ...... etc.)

The colours, the minifigs, the details, the clock, the dementors, everything in this set is fantastic&#161;&#161;&#161;",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-26T18:30:24Z","And award for the best Lego Harry Potter set goes to....","Without doubt, the highlight of the 2004 line of LEGO sets. Bionicle fans, drop those Metru Nui sets and eat your hearts out. Can any set, past or present ever hope to compare with the clock tower (which those of you who haven't bought the set, actually works,that is the pendulum swings, the dial turns, and the gate raises and lowers!). Buy the set, you won't be disappointed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-02T22:10:57Z","Not as good as the original...","...and it's just another re-make out to steal your money along with the other big sets  Hagrid's Hut and the Hogwarts Express (motorized and non). It seems good at first with the high piece count (wow!) but there's only one big section unlike the original. It's not as juniorized though and has some cool features not as boring but needs to be bigger. Overall, it's the best of the re-makes.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-08T10:49:14Z","Good set!","It's a good addition to your Harry Potter collection (if you have one), but it lacks a few things.
For example the stand-alone Gryffindor tower doesn't include the space you need to put a minifig there, and what's with that table?
Otherwise, I like the main part. And the clock function is... moderate.
I especially liked the pink mug and evil skeleton :)
The Trelawney minifig could have been done better, but the seit itself is really great!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-30T04:11:46Z","Exceptional, yet flawed","Okay, this is a much better set than the first. The series 1 Hogwarts Castle was essentially a bunch of rooms, and lacked form and exterior. While it indeed, did have far more interior rooms and space, none of it was quite as detailed as in this set. Also, this set has the form and exterior that were so lacking in the first set. The clock tower look is great, and the gate raising mechanism is a very, VERY nice touch. And unlike the paper in the old series one set, the roof is lego-made. Unfortunately, the set itself isn't very secure. I needed to construct a base just so i could move it around without it falling apart, and the overall lack of walls, especially in the lower area, which is essentially four corners, and no walls, with the exception of the spider webs and gate doors, none of which adding to the security of the thing. On the distinct plus side, there's pretty much anything a lego rendition of the castle would need. A dormitory(with beds!), a classroom(chalkboard!), a 'secret' alchemy lab, a few areas devoted to protecting secrets(a treasure chest out in the open in one, the other a trapdoor guarding a mappy thing) However, one small but glaring and avoidable weakness, that mappy thing is the same &quot;scroll with chalice and cauldron&quot; piece that anyone who has lots of these sets, probably has as many of as they do Harry's. All in all, this is a very nice, reccomendable set, but i'm hard pressed to give it higher than 8. High piece count(over 900) and cool mechanisms aside, the small weaknesses and faults add up and eventually cast an ignorable, yet visible shadow on it.  

Minifig wise, it's okay. The pale look slightly irks me, but the outfits more than make up for it. Moreover, the Dementors rule utterly, and make exceptional ghosts, moreso than the old glow-in-the-dark sheet ones, and also, have an exceptional cloak which you can use for other minifigs. The front gate, while a nice extra, is slightly unneccesary. It is a nice posing area for minifigs, though. Possibly my only other complaint, is that the Gryphindor tower doesn't go with the main castle easily, especially due to the form which it opens up with. In fact, the whole castle is in effect, 3 towers that go together rather unsecurely, and an extra castle. Overall, I can reccomend it, and it is probab ly the best HP castle(though arguments can be made for the Chamber of Secrets, especially in it's scenario of price drop-ness... due to the fact that it can be easily modified into a fully enclosed evil castle), if you're an HP fan(which i'm not necessarely, though i have seen all 3 movies and read into the universe a bit) there are definitely far worse sets.

"Irene","2009-12-17T14:34:26.467Z","How to fix the clock?","The face of my clock keeps falling off of this set. 

I suppose that after playing with the pendulum a few times, the clock face works it way loose.   Has anyone figured out a way to lock/glue it in place, but still allow the pendulum mechanism to work? 

I also find it tricky to run the pendulum. I problably need to post the instructions (in tiny little lettering) near the switches. 

*** Until I read the other reviews I never noticed that Draco was in his quidich uniform.  That is probably why it was so easy to accumulate Slitherin quidich players for my quidich court, and harder to accumulate Griffendor players.

"legolander","2007-06-09T06:02:23.513Z","Change costume...","This is my second review of the set and I'm not really making a review. I just want to suggest some things which I think would make this set more enjoyable. First, the Hogwarts uniforms... Well, I think that the new Dark Stone color doesn't really fit the flesh skin color of the minifigs. I think it's better if you switch them with the old Hogwarts uniforms (remember the light gray ones?). This is due to the fact that their new uniforms have the same color with the pillars of the castle; therefore, the minifigs are barely noticeable. Besides, there are no patches for the respective Houses. Moving on, I think it's good if you added some accessories within the castle, especially the west tower because it's kind of boring. I actually redecorated the potions lab by adding some more potions and a brain. Another thing is the clock tower. If you had noticed, there are holes on the part where the pendulum is attached. Since there are extra pieces (the little blue pieces that are used to attach bricks or other plates) , you can actually use them to put some scrolls up there. Just use your brilliant imagination and you'll definitely make some improvements for the Castle. By the way, you'll be needing other Harry Potter sets for the addtional accessories. Well, that's it for now. Try my suggestions and you'll probably enjoy redecorating Hogwarts Castle!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Matn","2008-01-04T07:03:37.95Z","Awesome castle! Best ever and it's big!","I just ended with building this amazing castle. It is much better than the first Hogwarts castle (I think) and it looks neat. It is pretty complete. When I opened my bags I found out that the head of Ron had a scar in it and that the gate (the big one, for the two doors) was cracked... The doors are in it, but they can't close so I ordered the replacement parts and I hope I'll get them as soon as possible. 

I first made the minifigs and in my opinion they are very nice, however, I don't like the fact that Draco has his Quidditch uniform on, it's a bit silly. The minifigs are: Dumbledore, Harry, Hermoine, Ron, Draco, two Dementors and Trelawney. That are nice figures, especially the two Dementors.

There aren't as much accesoires as in the latest Hogwarts, but it is ok. The general building is awesome! There are three apart buildings that you have to put together and you have a part of the castle. In this part there is a great function of the clocktower, if you wind the motor up, the clock will swing, the round clock on the front will turn and the gate behind the doors will go up. Nice system!

After you build that you have to build the Gryffindor tower, the bedroom is pretty cool! Especially the scarred door of the fat lady and the shield with the lion-sign. When you have build the tower, you may start the little entrance of Hogwarts, again, simple and nice.

The instruction book shows near the completed buildings the figures in... yellow! Oh, well, in the set they are flesh. And now I'm in love with the fleshie figs. I think if you combine this set with the escape of Sirius you have a nice castle and with the second hut of Hagrid you have a nice Hogwarts scene.

Great set, if you see this one and you are a Harry Potter or LEGO Castle fan: BUY IT!

"Z_wing","2009-08-04T07:24:33.653Z","no harry potter fan should be without this set","there are many reasons why no harry potter fan should be without this set, the main reason being the working clock. it is the best thing about this set. I bet sets like 8258, 8264 and 8292 are jealous of this set :) no I was only joking (please forgive me technic fans :) ) anyway this set has other cool features too

"LegoAdventures","2011-01-06T06:01:34.2Z","Hogwarts Castle","This set is honestly Phenomenal. It's design is Outstanding! and Architecturally flawless, and every piece when fully constructed looks smooth, neat and exceptional. Lego really did this set justice because i would say it is one of the best renditions of Hogwarts that i have ever seen and it looks fantastic. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; With over 900 pieces (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">928 Approximately, Different websites can alter including Brickset.com and Bricklink.com which says 899 pieces or 944 pieces</span>) 9 Min-figures and 3 Sumptuous sections of Hogwarts which are newly introduced in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span>, these 3 sections give a large amount of playability and include: The Front Gate, The Main Castle which is split into 3 joined sections (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">The middle Front Entrance and the 2 sections on either side of the Front Entrance</span>) and last but not least the Tower section which i think is the Gryffindor Tower considering it has 2 of the 4 Poster beds from the Gryffindor Boys common room. This set is full of wonderful features which i will reveal further in the review. One's imagination really can go wild over this Magical set haha!. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Released in 2004 to Coincide with the Blockbuster release of the film <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</span>, it is the largest set of the 10 Prisoner of Azkaban sets in the series and to be honest one of the greatest Harry Potter sets to. Unfortunately for me i didn't have much luck getting this set when i was young. I searched everywhere in all the Toy shops i went to, including the the top departments that really took their products seriously like David Jones and Myer. I never managed to find this set, I'm not sure it was even released in Australia however i find that a bit strange. I even checked LEGO.com and it said it wasn't available in Australia, though after clicking every country including Denmark <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lego's country of Origin</span> and found out that it said it wasn't available in Denmark and every other Country i pressed, i realized it mustn't have been available on LEGOshop@home and had been Discontinued. In fact the only sets from the Prisoner of Azkaban series that i did manage to find is 4755 Knight Bus and 4756 Shrieking Shack, Nevertheless i finally managed to get this set and the other Prisoner of Azkaban sets from the Wonderful website Bricklink.com. This particular set i bought for $240 AUD in a New Sealed Box in Excellent Condition and i can strongly say it was well worth the money for this Superior set!<br><br>Now i will get on to this set. Because their is a lot to talk about with this set I will split the entire set into sections.&nbsp; <br><br><h4>Box/Contents/Instructions:</h4><br>The Box is 57cm long, 38cm Tall and 9.8cm Thick. The Box has the usual front Illustration of Hogwarts and all its offerings like the Red Lego Insignia. Around all 4 sides the back and a small section of the front of the Box is basically covered in the colour Blue. The front of the Box has a flap and when lifted reveals an Illustration of the inside of the Castle, and on the bottom section shows the image that is provided by Brickset, there is also other angles of the castle next to that image provided showing the Clock/Swinging Pendulum/Front Security Gate mechanism. At the back of the Box there is an Illustration which shows the Hogwarts Castle set surrounded by all the other sets in the series (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Apart from the Exclusive 10132 Motorized Hogwarts Express</span>). However all the other sets have no colour, there Trans white and see through, the only set that is in colour is the Castle itself. These Illustrations are found on every Box in the Prisoner of Azkaban series and most of the Instructions or Pamphlets included in some of the sets. There is other features on the back of the Box like another image of the Inside of the Castle and features like the moving stair's and an Alternative model which you can build from LEGO.com however i don't think the Link is there anymore. On the top of the Box is an image of all the Min-figures apart from the Skeleton. And last but not least the bottom of the Box which has numerous Future references, Licensed agreements, Trademarks and where the Components are made which in this case the Components are made in Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden, China and Korea (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">I'm guessing the Pieces are made in Denmark, Switzerland and Sweden and the Instructions or Box are made in China or Korea</span>) After all that's what i love about Lego is that it's Quality European Manufactured. &nbsp;&nbsp; To open the Box you lift the flap on the front, and the image on the bottom is placed on with sticky tape. After removing the sticky tape or cutting through the sticky tape with a knife so you don't rip any of the Box (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">If you want the Box to stay in good condition</span>) You will find all the Contents inside. There is 7 Bags numbered 1-7 so you can have an organized, neat building experience. There is also a 2 sided Pamphlet which on one side shows Harry, Ron and Hermione looking down at all the Prisoner of Azkaban sets (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Except the Exclusive 10132 Motorized Hogwarts Express</span>) All the sets are see through and there are Dementors with Hogwarts in the Background. On the other side there is a couple of Images of Knights Kingdom, Star Wars, Lego-Land <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Billund</span>, Harry Potter and LEGO.com. There is also unfortunately a sticker however it is only 1 and the rest of the pieces in this set are printed ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Thankfully</span>""! and finally the thick 97 Page Instruction booklet, 107 pages including the Illustrations at the back. <br><br><h4>Mini-figs:</h4><br>All the Mini-figures feature the new Skin tone which matches the real colour of the actors skin in all Licensed Movies and Films a new feature that would feature in all Movies and films in the future (Harry Potter, Star Wars, Batman, Spider man, Prince of Persia and many more)<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore</span> more commonly known as<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Professor Dumbledore:</span></span> Dumbledore has 2 variations in this set, which is quite unusual and nobody knows which one of the two you will get if you buy this set in a Sealed Box. The first variation is the Dumbledore that has Bright Purple Pants, Torso and Cape and the Second Variation is the Dumbledore that has Bright Pink or Magenta Pants, Torso and Cape. I received the Bright Purple Dumbledore in my set however i also wanted the Pink Dumbledore so i bought it of Bricklink. Dumbledore features his usual bushy Grey eyebrows and sparkling eyes with Shiny Half Moon Spectacles. He also has a simple smile but that is covered from his long Grey beard. With his Grey beard he has long Grey hair and when put all together you just wanna cuddle him he he. Dumbledores Torso features Pink/Purple outfit with Gold decorations most of which is covered by his Beard. His pants are Purple/Pink and has a bright green rope with what seems to be some Gold accessories attached to it and some more Gold decorations which are the same as the ones on his torso. <br><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Professor Sybill Patricia Trelawney:</span> Professor Trelawney also surprisingly has 2 variations in this set though the changes are quite small. The first Variation is the Trelawney which has a Bright Pink or Magenta Wizard Hat (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Basically identical to Dumbledore's Pink/Magenta colour</span>) and Bright Pink Beads on her dress (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Also identical to the Pink/Magenta colour used on Dumbledore</span>) And the second Variation is the Trelawney which has a Bright Purple Wizard Hat (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Basically again identical to Dumbeldore's Bright Purple colour</span>) and inevitably Bright Purple beads on her dress (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Basically identical to the Bright Purple on the Bright Purple Dumbledore</span>) She features Pretty sparkling Black eyes and Large Black Magnifying Glasses like in the Book and in the Movie. She has lovely light Salmon Pink lips and 2 little black smiling marks next to her lips resembling her smiling. Her torso features a beautiful combination of Cobalt Blue, Cyan Blue, White and Navy Blue robes and outfit, and there is a black lace which has a purple bead in the middle and attached to the bottom of the bead is a Cyan Blue Opal. Her dress is a sloped Lego piece similar to that of the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lego Professor Mcgonagall</span>, it features the same Cobalt Blue, Cyan Blue, White and Navy Blue outfit and robes. I received the Purple variation and so i bought the Pink variation on Bricklink.com, so i also could have some variety, And besides both variations will get rarer in the future.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Dementors:</span> The Dementors are the last Mini-figures in this set to have 2 variations, However the change is very minimal although does effect the appearance. The first variation is the Dementors that has Purplish Dark Grey cloaks and the second variation is the Dementors with the Grey cloaks. I received the Grey cloaks and personally i think they look better. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">""The Dementors are amongst the foulest creatures that walk this Planet"",</span> a&nbsp; once wise Professor Lupin said to Harry and to be honest i think Lego did an Astronomically wonderful job on the creepy design factor. The Dementor's look Diminishing, vile, cruel and spooky Themselves. They have Sand Green face's which look like their Sucking the Soul out of someone and their Skeletal body and loose Skeletal arms covered with a tatty Cloak with one leg resembling them floating give them an image that could chill the bone. <br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">I think its strange having 3 different Mini-figures in each set and I'm not sure why they did it, i suppose it gives people some sort of variety if people want one of the other colours. Or perhaps it could have been colour consistency or a manufacture error. Or possibly Lego decided to make different colours depending on the Country that receives it.</span><br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Harry James Potter:</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>Harry Potter features his Black Messy hair, Red scar, Round glasses with Sparkling eyes and simple smile. He also features the new Dark Grey Hogwarts Uniform and sweater, with Gold and Crimson Red Tie, White Collar and stitching around the Neck and bottom of the sweater. There is also a Gold and Crimson Red lace around the bottom of the sweater and various black lines, showing he is so active and adventurous that he's uniform is always messy and not neat. And last but not least he also features his Dark Grey pants.<br><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Ronald Bilius Weasley:</span> Ron Weasley features his Mopped Orange hair, Sparkling Black eyes and Orange freckles underneath and his quirky smile. He also features the new Dark Grey Hogwarts Uniform and sweater, with Gold and Crimson Red Tie, White Collar and stitching around the Neck and bottom of the sweater. There is also a Gold and Crimson Red lace around the bottom of the sweater and various black lines, showing he is so active and adventurous that he's uniform is always messy and last but not least he also has his Dark Grey pants. <br><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Hermione Jean Granger:</span> Hermione Granger features her beautiful curly Brunette hair, Sparkling Black eyes and gorgeous red lips and small black lines next to her lips resembling her smiling. Hermione's Torso features the new Dark Grey Hogwarts Uniform and sweater, with Gold and Crimson Red Tie, White Collar and stitching around the Neck and bottom of the sweater. There is also a Gold and Crimson Red lace around the bottom of the sweater.Hermione however doesn't have the black lines around her sweater that Ron and Harry have resembling that she likes to keep her uniform tidy and respectful. She also has the Time Turner around her neck which when you look closely has wonderful detail. <br><br style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Draco Lucius Malfoy:</span> </span>Draco Malfoy features in his Hogwarts Slytherin Quidditch Uniform.He also features his usual Blond Combed Hair and Mischievous face. His Quidditch Uniform is Emerald and has Dark Emerald and Silver around the neck with Black lines. His torso also features a Badge with a Silver Serpent in the middle. He also has a thick Silver line near his waist and the same untidy black lines around his torso and last of all his Emerald Green Pants. <br><br><h4>Main Castle:</h4><br>The main Castle when looking at it from the front is split into 3 sections being the Front section and 2 sections on either side of that. That is how i will review the Main Castle. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Front Section: </span><br><br>The Front Section of the Main Castle is the Front Entrance there is 2 Large Chestnut brown doors (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">With handles</span>) and when opened there is a Security Gate which has numerous bars on it stopping any nasties from entering the Castle, Similar to a Medieval Gate. It also has a Rope like piece with 2 studs at either end that is attached to a Turning Gear which i explain in a few sentences. There is also a space for people to walk in and out of the Castle freely. There is a formation of 4 Column structures that support everything above the doors. Directly above the doors is a formation of different coloured Translucent Squares, Purple, Red and Blue which is a lovely decoration which looks to be a Glass structure. Directly above the Glass structure is a turning Gear. The Gear itself has 4 holes and in those 4 holes you push 4 Technic Pins (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Small Blue tube like Lego pieces</span>) into each hole. Once pushed into the hole's they make a clicking nose, that means they are connected. They are now strong and secure and shouldn't come out. On each Technic Pin when pushed in there is 4 tubes (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Like the top of a Lego brick</span>) which enables you to attach a Lego piece to each Technic Pin. You place 3 Black studs on top of the Technic Pin and then you place the Rope piece from the Security Gate to the Fourth Technic Pin. Once the Rope from the Security gate is attached to the Turning Gear you place 1 Red flat round Lego piece on the 3 Black Studs and Stud from the Rope.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Wow that was hard to explain for a better understanding of what i mean either download the Instructions from Brickset.com or go to Peeron.com and search 4757 and click Instructions you will understand what i mean.</span> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>After building the Security Gate Mechanism you begin on the Swinging Pendulum Mechanism which is a formation of Technic pieces, Clogs and Gears and a Grey all in one Wind up motor (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Yes the Wind up motor is a custom all in one piece</span>) You then put on the Large Front Clock and attach it to the Gears and Clogs. Once all the Technic pieces, Gears, Clogs and Wind Up motor are all in place, you can then, by turning one of the Clogs and lifting up 2 pieces (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">All these pieces are attached and joined to the wind up motor</span>) you can Open the Front Security Gate, Make the Swinging Pendulum Swing and Turn the Large Clock at the front. <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Phew!</span>, That section is by far the hardest to explain and is the most Technical and Comprehensive part of the building experience in the Castle. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">You really need to pay close attention to the Instructions</span> and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Don't rush</span> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">make sure you take you time as you should with all Lego sets</span>. As i said earlier if you want a better understanding of the set<span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span>Download the Instructions either from Brickset or Peeron.com.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last but not least there is a small Clock above the Large Clock and above the Technical Mechanisms is a small Owlery which has 2 Perches, which 2 Owls sit on. There is a white Owl, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Most likely Harry's he he</span>, and a Black Owl. Then you construct the 2 roof pieces which fold in and last but not least a tower structure at the very top of the Middle tower. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Section on the Right: </span><br><br>You start at the bottom with 4 Column structures. At the front of this section is a large Grey spider web which you can place a Trans-Neon Greenish Yellow Spider in the middle of the Web. On the ground there is a Cute Emerald Frog (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Maybe Neville's Toad haha</span>) On one of the 4 Column structures there is a Grey Lego piece which enables you to attach a Gold Key. On the column which has the Attachment for the Gold Key there is 2 Hinge's so you can attach another Column and on the column is a Brown Lego piece that has a Printed image of Potions and Jars (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">This column piece which has a long flat Lego piece at the bottom of it to resemble a small part of the floor, can be turned back and fourth so you can hide the Gold Key behind the Printed Lego piece</span>) which will soon become the Moving Stairs. Above the 4 Column structures is numerous Arch type pieces which look smooth and neat. These Arch pieces become the floor for the second level. &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you have put the floor down on the second level you can finish one of the Moving Stairs. Now you can move that Staircase which has 2 Hinges enabling you to move it back and fourth. The second level floor actually has a Trap door. Once building the wall with 2 windows you make a little Map section that shows a Goblet and a Cauldron with little symbols like a Star, Moon and Half moon on a flat Green Lego piece, that has 2 Fires lit on either side of it. Basically a Mini-fig goes up to the Map and then you can pull a Trans-Neon Greenish Yellow Spider with a Long Lego piece under it that is attached through a hole of a Technic Lego piece under the Second floor.<span style=""font-style: italic;""> Once the Spider is pulled the only support that the Trapdoor has is the piece under it that is the piece at the end of the Spider so when the spider moves that piece isn't there and as a result the Trapdoor falls down and causes the Mini-fig to fall to the bottom level</span>. You then build a small Balcony which a Professor or student can stand and look out of. The 3rd floor is intentionally inside the roof. You build a small portion of the side of the Castle and the Front of the Roof, There is a Brown Treasure Chest and inside is a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Quantum Purple Magnifying Glass</span> which is rare. You also add a brown long Lego piece to the Front of this section directly under the Windows which gives a clean and neat look to the design. <br><br style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Section on the Left: </span><br><br>The Bottom of this section is Basically exactly the same as the Right Section. 4 columns, The spiderweb, the 2 hinges for the other Moving Staircase and even the same attachment for another Gold Key however there is a Trans Red Spider and in the middle of the Floor their is a Geranium Red Throne. There is also the same Arch formations as in the Right Section of the Castle however the Second floor is very different compared to the Right section of the Main Castle. The second floor of this section from the front wall is a sort of Grey roof formation with 2 Gaps which look to be small architectural windows (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">When looking at the Main castle from the front look at the Left section and you will see the Grey roof formation situated in the middle section</span>) On the actual floor for this section is 2 Red Seats which have flat surfaces enabling the Mini-fig to swing around freely. There is a small Brown Desk in front of these 2 Red seats, and on the Small Brown table is a Trans Neon Light Cyan Blue Ink Cone piece with a Feathered Quill Lego piece. Behind the Table you build a Curved Tower section which has a Printed Chalkboard (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Thank you Lego!</span>) and when turned around reveals a Skeleton. Personally i think the second floor for this section is one of my favorite parts, It's Awesome and Cute. This is a Classroom which you can place Professor Trelawney or Dumbledore. And last of all to the Main castle the 3rd Floor which is Professor Tewlawney's Classroom. This section is in the roof because in the Book and Movie Professor Trelawney's Classroom is accessed via the attic. It features Some small potions on 1 table, On another table is a Blue cup and a Trans Pink cup and a Skull on a turntable with a Glass Magnifying Enclosure which when placed over the Skull makes it Magnify and look really fantastic, when looking at it from different angles it looks all contoured and ... Awesome. The last part of this section that you construct is the roof.<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;"">You then place all of these 3 Sections together and that makes the main Castle. I'm sorry if it was difficult to understand however some of the Parts were a bit tricky to explain, but as i said earlier download the Instructions Via Brickset.com or Peeron.com for a full look at this set and this part of the Castle. </span><br><br><h4>Tower (Gryffindor Tower)</h4><br>This part consists of a turning door which when you push the door it turns around and reveals a secret compartment with <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Monster Book of Monsters</span> inside it. On the front of this door is a sticker :( Yes but at least it is one. And it shows the Gryfindor Entrance Portrait with the 3 Claw slashes in it and the Missing Fat Lady. The bottom floor has a table with a Barrel type piece in the middle, so you can swing the desk around and hide something in the Barrel then swing the desk back around and it's hidden. On top of the desk is an Envelope Lego piece. There is 4 Columns and Arch like pieces which lead to the second floor of the Tower. The second floor is one of the most exquisite and fantastic parts of the set. It features 2, 4 Poster Beds from the Gryffindor Common room where Harry and Ron can sleep. There is even 2 Hidden sections at the end of the beds so you can slide 2 books into slots. There is also 2 Lego Trans Clear Cylindrical and cone shaped Lego pieces which seem to be Lollie jars of some sort. Both beds in this section can open up for a larger access of the section And in between the bed are 2 arch pieces which make the roof look very realistic. And last of all a small space on the 3rd floor which has 2 Lego Flames and a section were Scabbers can be placed. Above this section there is numerous Tower Structures leading to a waving Flag. This is the Tallest part of the Castle. <br><br><h4>Front Gate:</h4><br>The Front Gate is fairly small, however it is a nice addition to the set. It consists of the 2 large Black Gates which protect the School. And 2 Walls next to those gates, which you can place the 2 Dementors in front of. There is also 2 Red Lanterns which hang of the wall. There is also a small roof formation over the top of the Front Gates. <br><br><h4>Overall:</h4><br>I hope your not to befuddled with my long review however i do believe in a Quality review. <br>So Overall this set is Phenomenal, Outstanding and Flawless. It is one of the best Harry Potter sets in the entire Harry Potter series, I can't say what Harry Potter set is the best because there all so incredible and unique in their own way. And if you can find one i strongly, strongly recommend it with full confidence. It really is Enchanting and Magical a complete Triumph!&nbsp; 5/5<br><br>Thank you so much for taking the time to read my review. :)",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
