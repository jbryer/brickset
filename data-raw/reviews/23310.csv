"Bumblepants","2015-04-08T21:28:23.717Z","Rock You Like A Hurricane","<p>The Hurricane Heist clocks in as the largest bad guy vehicle in the Agentsverse wave 1 and packs quite a punch.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of great parts in this set. Most notable are the plethora of olive green wedges and slopes. 28 1x2 plates in olive green are also quite useful. There are many brackets of various size throughout as well which are always excellent to have more of.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Ultra Agents series shines its brightest in the minifigure category and this set is no exception. Psyclone is just brilliant and full of excellent detail. Tan accented with dark gray and dark blue make up his figure and his two-sided face has a high altitude mask on one side and a patch eye on the opposite. His helmet is the real highlight, molded in two colors with breathing tubes extending down to the middle of the torso. Psyclone also comes equipped with a helipack on his back for flying without his large mech. Two agents come with this set as well. Agent Jack Fury has excellent printing on both torso and legs with a bulletproof vest design. He also has a jetpack to help track down Psyclone and a most excellent two-hand white blaster weapon. Agent Caila Phoenix is also well designed and the pink hair piece is excellent. My only complaint here is that she is not provided with a helmet for riding her motorbike. Seems like a big oversight as a helmet would improve the Tron-like design of the bike as well as being a better example to kids of proper safety behavior. There is also a City Guard who is not to be overlooked. His white uniform shirt is most welcome in the sea of blue that is your average City police officer and he has a nice cap with a badge print as well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Beginning with the two jetpack devices and minifigures is the expected course for a set like this. Both packs are well designed and unique from one another to add interest. The Agent Cycle comes next. It is a nifty little design and manages to evoke a strong resemblance to the futuristic look of the Tron series. It seems a tad on the clunky side at first but it does manage to pack wheels that rotate for hover/flight mode and two spring launcher pistols into the design. The Heli-mech (I guess that is what this is?) comes next. Starting with the cockpit and base of the model it is a rather enjoyable build with some clever snot design here and there. Once the build progress to the legs and wings however, it bogs down a bit as it you make mirrored copies.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once finished there is quite a bit of play function. As mentioned above the Agents Cycle can change to flight mode. In addition to that, the Heli-mech rotors spin when the rear rocket is twisted via a fairly complex technic gearing system which is fun. it also has a pair of springloaded missiles, a stash for stolen money, and the legs fold up for flight. The model does struggle to stand up unless posed just like the main image. The ungainly proportions tip it over in just about any other setup.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great minifigures and enjoyable to play with alongside a pretty good selection of parts make this a fun model. The Agent Cycle really adds a lot to the set even though it is small and the details of the jetpacks and weapons are top notch. Only big complaint is the repetitiveness of the build gets a bit wearisome. The Hurricane Heist is a fun set, especially if you can find a good deal on it and works well with the other Ultra Agents sets in the series.</p>

"Fauch","2015-04-21T23:14:51.51Z","Is it a bird? Is it a plane?","<p><font face=""Rockwell"">Nope, it&#39;s Psyclone. His ride is&nbsp;kind of a weird mix between a plane, a copter and a mech.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Between wedges, hinges, ball joints, shooters, blades or quite a few brackets, you have nice pieces for building mechs or ships. Also 5 nices silver hoses (got a spare one) and a trans-green 2x8 flaps. Lots of olive green obviously.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Very good, excellent printing throughout, even the cop is pretty nice, his hat has a cool mold and some printing. Double sided face on all characters except the cop. Phoenix has a face with and without the virtual glasses, wheread Psyclone can be with or without his mask. He got a red eye, eye patch and huge eyebrow. I think he is in my top 5 of best minifigures ever</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build includes snot, technic, hinges and ball joints for articulation. The most interesting part is the mechanism that allows the 2 propellers to spin when you turn the reactor. It&#39;s pretty obvious, though seeing how the 2 wings aren&#39;t aligned, it was interesting to see how they pulled it off. The wheels of the motorbike are pretty hard to build, it may require some strength.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is pretty poseable (though getting it balanced is another story, but there are at least a few different ways to achieve that). Legs are moveable at the feet and at the &quot;hip&quot; (not the knees), spring loaded shooters turn 360, canons on the front are on ball joints, and the whole back area with the wings can be put up or down. I thought the wings could have been hinged too, but when I tried they were too heavy (though the propeller mechanism still worked)</p>

<p>The bike wheels can be moved&nbsp;to flight mode, also it has 2 studs shooters. Surprinsingly they have a quite a bit of punch for such little weapons, at least they can shoot down a minifig, provided you shot it right.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A quite original, powerful and impressive vehicle for a super villain. the model is probably like 25 cm high and over 30 cm wide (when posed like on the picture), quite a bit of poseability, which is interesting for a vehicle, many shooters, fun fonctions. The price is fair (though, maybe americans won&#39;t be too happy about it). Don&#39;t really see any&nbsp;obvious bad point, and I don&#39;t think lego ever made anything like that before.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There is a small motorbike for Agent Caila Phoenix to use, it has two stud shooters. It has wings that move up and down and wheels that rotate. So it can drive or fly</p>

<p>Psyclone&#39;s&nbsp;transforming flyer is pretty awesome, it is mostly green and silver. There is a knob you turn that rotates propellers. You can fit the character into the cockpit. There are two laser &nbsp;cannons on each side and two additional&nbsp;missile&nbsp;shooters that work pretty much like stud shooters. It has a little hatch where some money is located that Psyclone has stolen. The legs move and the flyer turns from a flyer to a standing machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set provides good play time for kids as the story line is quite exiting. The Psyclone is a really cool character. The app also helps to build on a story by providing comics.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
We look forward to reading what you have to say.<br />

<p>Building this was not quite as tricky as the Ultracopter, but still a challenge. The rotors use a lot of universal joints and the engines / wind turbines are mounted at an angle the the rear fuselage.</p>

<p>I liked getting so any olive / drab green parts. Handy for any military build.</p>

<p>Playability is good. The robot mode is very posable, though knees might be nice for the legs. The hinge mid fuselage is good. The hover / non hover bike for the Ultra Agent minifig is cool as is the jet pack and honking big minifig gun. I like the highly jointed forward guns, the spring launcher that can be angled up and down. The &quot;baddie&quot; minifig back pack seems a little over the top but it&#39;s still fun. I pitty the poor security guard caught in the middle. I feel like I need a modular bank to break into now. It almost needs a coulb of claws to pluck out a safe rather than the hug baddie jump pack.</p>

<p>Pros -</p>

<p>Gives the &quot;baddies&quot; something big to fight with.</p>

<p>Cons -</p>

<p>Looks a little ungainly on the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Looks like it&#39;s not too popular second hand. Personally I am glad as it&#39;s cheap, but as one of the biggest &quot;baddie&quot; vehicles for Ultra Agents, seems a shame. Hard to compete with how good the Ultra Copter, Ultra Ocean Corvette (HQ)&nbsp;and UltraSonic Jet are I suppose.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
