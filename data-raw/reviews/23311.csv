"mikemakesmusic","2014-09-19T03:29:55.95Z","Terrific Design","<p>I&#39;ve had my eye on this set for 6 months and it doesn&#39;t disappoint! &nbsp;The build is pretty straight forward with no real surprises. &nbsp;The playability of this set is off the charts!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are set out in 2 books. &nbsp;The second is by far the largest. &nbsp;The build took about 2.5 hours. &nbsp;The steps are laid out in customary fashion for a non-expert set of instructions (parts lists are shown in the top corner of the page).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A couple of new parts (for me) with quite a bit of technic parts and building for the chassis of the trailer. &nbsp;Colors are outstanding and great fun for a secret agent type theme. &nbsp;I LOVE the wheel covers! &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs are in line with today&#39;s LEGO minifigs in terms of detailing. &nbsp;The new thing, at least for me, is the gun that shoots single round studs. &nbsp;The gun REALLY sends the studs flying, so have something to stop them or they aren&#39;t going to last long! &nbsp;They really travel. &nbsp;GREAT design IMO.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Great fun. &nbsp;THIS THING IS HUGE! &nbsp;As mentioned before, there is a fair amount of technic building, particularly in the chassis of the trailer. &nbsp;My favorite part of the build would have to be the front end of the tractor unit. &nbsp;It is built separately and then attached to the tractor as a completed section. &nbsp;That is not unusual, but the detailing, symmetry and greeble&nbsp;are simply fantastic. &nbsp;I love the design of this section of the model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a parts count of 1060, small parts abound. &nbsp;Take your time, study the images in the books and you&#39;ll be fine. &nbsp;Lots of fun to build!!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Just gorgeous for its genre. &nbsp;Doesn&#39;t compare to modular buildings or large expert Creator buildings and models, but it defines a new theme and does so with great success.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This one goes up to 11! &nbsp;One of my favorite&nbsp;sets. &nbsp;Strongly recommended.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2014-09-21T19:51:38.42Z","Party van has arrived. ","<p>There comes a point in a person&#39;s life when you start to realise that hey, even a Mobile Police Unit (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60044-1/Mobile-Police-Unit"">60044</a>) just won&#39;t cut it in terms of being entirely certain that your good citizens are under surveillance <strong>at every moment of every day</strong>. Sure, those cops work hard and do what they do, but how much damage can you really do based out of a stodgy white truck and with just two pairs of boots on the ground? You need a heavy-duty, all-encompassing means of keeping tabs on people. You <em>need </em>the Ultra Agents Mission HQ.</p>

<p>This set is arguably the successor to the Mobile Command Center (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8635-1/Mobile-Command-Center"">8635</a>) of six years prior, the flagship &quot;good&quot; set of the Agents line to which the Ultra Agents pay obvious homage. The first Agents run went off the shelves towards the end of my personal &quot;dark ages&quot;, so I never had the chance owned the aforementioned Mobile Command Center. By all accounts, however, I am told that this set fixes many of the stability issues that 8635 had, and beefs it up as well, if pictures are any judge. My point here is that I will be reviewing Mission HQ on its own merits, since I cannot accurately compare it to its predecessor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Non-licensed themes are not terribly generous with their Minifigs, though perhaps it&#39;s also true that set exclusivity is less of a problem as well. That being said, you get five Minifigs, of which I believe only two are strictly exclusive to this set. All of them are, of course, impressive, and I get a really big kick out of the &quot;men in black&quot; design choice that LEGO went with this time. At the same time, each Minifig is absolutely bursting with personality, and it even the dullest-minded of individuals will be able to recognise the tropes embodied by each of the Ultra Agents: the hard-as-nails, no-nonsense Solomon Kane (ostensibly the leader?), the tough action girl Caila Phoenix (complete with pink hair and a matching shirt), the tech-savvy Curtis Bolt, and the analytical, if somewhat bookish, Christina Hydron. The last of these is the exclusive &quot;good guy&quot; in this set, and her printing is not so outlandish that she would seem out of place, say, with the girls from Research Institute (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21110-1/Research-Institute"">21110</a>). MOC-minded&nbsp;readers will find a lot to play around with here.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most desirable of the Minifigs in this set, though, is the nefarious Terrabyte, a tech-oriented (gamer?) type villain who has some sort of mecha which he&#39;ll use to, er, hack into the city&#39;s bank accounts or something. I don&#39;t know, and it doesn&#39;t matter, because both him and his mech&nbsp;are oozing with so much personality that you&#39;ll probably find yourself rooting for him more than the Ultra Agents themselves. Of particular note is his helmet, which is so intricately moulded that it almost beggars belief. The bad guys in this first wave seem to suffer from a relative lack of firepower, so Terrabyte&#39;s mech will doubtlessly serve as a centrepiece for the evil-oriented. It&#39;s so good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, there are some large builds that suffer from occasional monotony due to their sheer size. Haunted House (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10228-1/Haunted-House"">10228</a>) comes to mind - though the finish product is unquestionably great, there are a few tedious sections that are perhaps unavoidable. I don&#39;t know how it happened, but Mission HQ was so much fun to build from start to finish. Even the side panels - which take a bag each and are identical - were interesting enough due to use of wide Technic panelling that I have never encountered before. The front part of the truck is a real treat to build, to say nothing of fitting in all the high-tech bits and bobs within the trailer itself. Quite frankly, the fold-out mechanism reminded me quite strongly of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mighty_Max_(toyline)"">Mighty Max</a> toys, which might be a nostalgia bomb if you&#39;re as old as I am. The trailer is engineered such that the details and the &quot;negative space&quot; cancel each other out, which basically means that in spite of its complexity, the base can be opened and closed in seconds with no finicky manipulation required. Outstanding design overall, especially for the space conscious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is, however, an elephant in the room that needs to be addressed as far as this set is concerned, and that&#39;s stickers. And boy does this set have stickers. If I balked when I saw the sticker sheet for Airport (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/3182-1/Airport"">3182</a>), then I positively had a seizure when this one slid out of the packaging. If you dislike stickers, I&#39;m sorry, because this set has loads of them (get out the tweezers). A good number of them are avoidable - such as the very large ones adorning the outside that I most certainly did NOT apply - but many do add real flavour to the set, especially the ones that are supposed to represent computer screens et al, and they are nice if applied properly and are fortunately fairly easy to do so. I will, however, highlight one egregious one, which is the monitor-sticker on the large trans-blue window on the left back wall inside the HQ. Not only is the sticker itself massive, but it has to be applied <em>sideways </em>relative to how the studs are facing due to SNOT being used in that location. <strong>Take note of that if you&#39;re going to apply it</strong>. I almost messed it up, and probably would have burst into tears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When fully built, the truck is large.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah. It really is impressive, both terms of size and aesthetics. It&#39;s so impressive that you&#39;ll probably want to play with it. And probably move Nick Fury in as well because I just know that the man is going to be jealous.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a superhero freak or just like &quot;action sets&quot;, this one is a real winner. Seriously. It&#39;s beefy, it&#39;s cool, and it&#39;s fun. The Minifigs are expressive, the villain is suitably menacing, and there&#39;s just so much to do and look at. LEGO, &nbsp;you&#39;ve proved it to yourselves and to everyone else: you don&#39;t need a license to come up with incredible stuff. I cannot wait for the second wave.&nbsp;</p>
