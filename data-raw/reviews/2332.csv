"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-02T10:02:37Z","Very Good Set","The train is solid, with a double-compartment in the engine (pull off a portion to reveal coal, push back coal to reveal luggage).  I still can't figure out where to put the Hogwarts crest stickers.  The station is simplicity and beauty incarnate.  Comes with a luggage cart-thing, which I don't think you can see in the picture.  ANOTHER monster book of monsters is included.  My only real complaint is the $19 it's going to cost me to renovate the second car to connect to the motorized train.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-05T19:47:15Z","Fun set","This set is sure to please any child or collector, really. I've enjoyed Legos for 3 decades and this is my first Lego train set--I was pretty excited when I bought it. It's the &quot;little&quot; touches that I like in this set.

You don't get to see any station in the movie, but the addition of the little bench, the luggage cart, and the lightpost are some of these little touches I mentioned. Not to mention the chocolate bar, the monster book, and the dementor. I love how the engine looks--I was comparing it with the one in the movie. Very accurate!

I also enjoy the minifigs. The &quot;clothing&quot; on them are unique and cool, and Lupin's a neat figure. And, you know what? The flesh-color change is actually fine with me. When I first saw this in the store, I said &quot;Flesh instead of yellow? Ugh!&quot; I was surprised at first, but thought afterwards, &quot;Why not?&quot;",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T03:47:01Z","My first train set","A really good set. The combination of red and black is really working. The only problem is that the &quot;train-stand&quot; is too small. Why is it bigger in the motorized set (10132)?

This set really matches the 10027 (Train-Engine Shed). So, now my Hogwart's Express train is waiting in the Train-Engine Shed and ready to take off once all the Hogwarts students have boarded.

Play on.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2009-01-17T19:08:41.03Z","Good Set but Not Motorized","Although this one isn't motorized, this set is still good. The design of the train is pretty cool but looks the same as the 2001 version. The station is also a nice part of this set and makes this set fun. This is good, but not the best version though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mngoult","2012-03-31T09:30:49.12Z","For the number of pieces this set is a hidden gem.","<p>A long sought after but recent addition to my collection, this set seems to hold its value extremely well considering the relatively small piece count. And it is this small piece count that gains this set an extra star in my opinion.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The usual style of box that was produced with all HP sets during the prisoner of azkaban run, its actually quite compact and meeting Lego's usual high stndard finish. The usual action scene on the front and the optional play features detailed on the back. The instructions are in A4 form just one book for the train, carriage and platform. <br></p><p>All lego instructions are clear and detailed (especially if you have been naughty and recently tried cheaper alternatives to lego like me recently, never again) they do not feature the box which summerises which pieces you need for each stage but then i'm not sure when this was introduced anyway. <br></p><p><br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>Just less than 400 give or take which makes it a small to medium set in my eyes. I am still impressed with the end result considering a handful of parts. There are lots of windows pieces (as you'd expect for the carriage) and the train bases which offer lots of opportunity to make your own version. <br><br>There is a sticker sheet included in the set to detail the carriage and engine, even for those amongst us who do not enjoy stickers please do not let this put you off. <br><br>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>Ther are four altogether, i believe Ron and Harry are unique to the set (not counting 10132 anyway) with casual wizrd clothing while the dementor appears in other PoA sets. I think Lupin appears in other sets but he still fetches a premium on bricklink should you be missing him. Generally a good selection and four figures is certainly respectable for a RRP of less than £35. <br><br>
<h4>The build</h4>Actually very enjoyable and just about an hour of solid building (maybe quicker without a four year old climbing on the instructions/parts ). You make up the train then carriage and finally the small Hogmeasde station. For those getting the set MISB i think it has seperate bags for each stage to simplify the process. <br><br>There are no complicated stages allthough its not clear what studs the wheels clip on to underneath the train so i recommend trial and error until it looks right. <br><br>
<h4>The completed model</h4>This is where it comes into its own, less than 400 pieces yet you end up with a decent sized train and platform, this set is great for vrooming around on all surfaces and not only is an exceptional interpretation of a train (for the piece count) but it actually has some very cool little play features.<br><br>The carriage is very sturdy and features a completly removable top which is a very nice idea and allows endless placing of figures and play inside. <br><br>The engine features a removable top, slidable plate that allows access to a hidden compartment which contains some specialised pieces/tiles. <br><br>The platform is another economy of pieces but is functional and features a nice sign and bench.<br><br>If i had to criticise it would be that it feels and looks a little light and flimsy, it isn't its just in a clear effort to keep the piece count down the train is quite hollow which is a trade off i'm happy to take if it originally kept the price down.<br><br>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>People have mentioned its relatively small and the station isn't very big, both of these points are valid and true, but this set was only £35, think how much the new Hogworts train is.</p><p><br></p><p>For the original price (which has to be the mark, rather then what i paid) it is a brilliant set, lovely engine bright and vibriante colours, great figures and endless play opportunities and possible expansions.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>This set is def worth a look if you see it for sale, but rememeber it was £35 when released so what ever you pay for it please only judge it on that.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
