<p>This is my first one of the new Fire vs Ice wave of Ultra Build Figures, so there are lots of new pieces.</p>

<h3>Packaging/Instructions</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.us.lego.com/en-us/gallery/upload/cbf6900a-471b-4e0f-a24a-eaa7010aeb8d?xml=1&amp;showmedia=1&amp;width=800&amp;height=600"" style=""width: 400px; height: 300px;"" /></p>

<p>The packaging for this set is just like most other Ultra Build sets, it comes in a bag that is re-sealable.</p>

<p>The Instructions are fine, though like some other Ultra Build sets they are a bit crushed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The new parts in this set are great for MOCs, even though this set doesn&#39;t have as many Transparent bone pieces.</p>

<p>The new pieces in this set include two of the new sliver weapon piece, six of the new gold claw piece,a brand new armour piece and Panthar&#39;s&nbsp;head and lower jaw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty average for an Ultra Build set and takes very little time to assemble it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The complete model looks really cool and the new armour piece with the Chi Orb looks really good and the Chi function works really well.</p>

<p>Chi Panthar&nbsp;is also really good for posing and his opening mouth is great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is worth the money for sure and if you are a fan of Hero Factory,Bionicle or Chima this is a set worth getting.</p>
