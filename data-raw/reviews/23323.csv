<p>Packaging is nice, as a standard constraction theme set. Instruction is nice, too. Nothing much to say here acutally.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>New re-colored parts, I love the transparent light&nbsp;blue and reddish brown. Unfortunatelly, not much for&nbsp;the&nbsp;new parts, just only the body armor and Mungus head piece</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build has no unique building techniques except for the shoulders and the weapon</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks very cool, sturdy, strong, well covered and evil. The LEGO team has done a great job capturing the look of a humanoid-mammoth</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>+Re-colored parts<br />
+Evil, mean looking<br />
+New great head piece<br />
+Good for both play and display</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>+Weapon is not staying in it&#39;s place</p>

<p>Although this is one of the best chima&nbsp;constration set for this year, I recommend you guys should buy this set if you love chima or hero factory or both.</p>
