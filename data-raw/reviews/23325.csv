My favorite feature is the way the wings pop up when you pull down or up on the tube. I also like the chest plate where you can really store an orb of fire Chi. His weapon is also really cool because of the way it looks like he&#39;s REALLY firing it. The Technic part on it looks like a real string.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I liked the foil bag because you can store Fluminox in it. The instructions were just like any other Lego instructions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this model are some of the best parts I&#39;ve ever seen in my 5+ years of Lego experience.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A really cool build because of the way they only put a little bit of Technic parts on the actual figure. The joints are tight and with this new style they don&#39;t crack like Bionicles.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The best action figure that Lego has done so far!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I think that this is a really nice model and I can&#39;t wait to see him on the TV show!</p>
