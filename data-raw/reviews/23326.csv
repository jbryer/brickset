<p>The bag displays Sir Fangar&nbsp;with an awesome looking pose on the front and a separate pose on the back that displays the features and&nbsp;the Combiner model with 70209 Chi Mungus. The instructions are similar in size to Furno&nbsp;XL&#39;s instructions, and display the same image as that on the front of the bag. In the back of the&nbsp;manual, the other figures and sets of the Summer 2014 Chima Line are displayed.</p>

<p>In terms of parts, this set is a gold mine. The exclusive or new pieces include Sir Fangar&#39;s&nbsp;head, cape, feet, and chest&nbsp;piece with blue-white chi orb. Other new pieces are the trans-blue bone attachments on his back, printed armor piece on his right leg, and two types&nbsp;trans blue &quot;bone pieces&quot; on his arms and&nbsp;right&nbsp;leg, and his trans blue hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t too difficult,&nbsp;although its extremely hard to put the bendable tube piece on his back. This might be frustrating for someone young.</p>

<p>The completed model looks awesome. It&nbsp;has great poseablity and holds together really nicely.</p>

<p>Overall, this is the best set set out of the summer 2014 Chima Line, and could be one of the best large&nbsp;&quot;constraction&quot; figures Lego has ever released. If you live in a country where this set is available, I strongly suggest you buy it. If not, I still suggest getting it online. It&#39;s great for those who want to play with it, display it, or use the pieces for creation /&nbsp;MOCs. See ya!</p>
