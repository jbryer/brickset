<p>For my first one of the new Speedorz sets I decided to get Inferno Pit, since it comes with a brand new Phoenix minifigure.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is the same design as the ones that were released in the start if the year.</p>

<p>The top of the packaging shows a picture &nbsp;of Fluminox&#39; head.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are actually pretty good, you get the new phoenix head, orange wings, the new exploding rock, plus all of the new Speedor pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;included in this set is Fluminox, this is the cheapest way to get him, as the only other set he comes in is the Phoenix Temple.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fluminox is really detailed and comes with a brand new torso print and orange wings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quick and easy like most other Speedorz sets.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The complete model is really cool, overall I&#39;m quite happy with the new Speedorz and they are much easier to use than before.</p>

<p>You also get five cards in this set, all of which are called Fluminox.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set worth getting and it&#39;s also the cheapest way to get a &nbsp;Phoenix minifigure, So overall I recommend this set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-27T16:59:10.977Z","Quite Different Speedorz Design.","<p><strong>Set #70155 Inferno Pit: </strong>With 2014 we saw new Speedorz designs, new packaging designs (making them much easier to open) and a new sub-theme. Fire vs. Ice. Are these Speedorz worth collecting? Read on to find out my thoughts on the Inferno Pit, and the overall play pattern changes.</p>

<p>Instructions</p>

<p>Standard Speedorz instructions here. And with much less to build due to the piece count in this set you may find yourself wondering just why they are so thick. It&rsquo;s because of the cross-promotional images, minifigure checklist and game play instructions. Honestly the design for this manual isn&rsquo;t bad, it follows each build based on the card for that particular element. It&rsquo;s an interesting choice and I kind of like it, as it makes the build super fast and easy to follow.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Fluminox: This was one of my first Fire Tribe members, officially, based on the Phoenix design and I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the winged tribes of Chima.&nbsp; He has an impressive looking double-sided torso print on a nice red torso, the golden armor patterns are particularly enjoyable. His legs have printing as is customary and are a nice dark maroon colour to boot. While his head is a dark maroon with double-sided facial printing and a lighter red brand new headpiece with phoenix markings printed n and a flaming crown.</p>

<p>The standard Chi armour is included in a pearl gold colour with two clips and two orange feathers. Overall he&rsquo;s a sweet minifigure. His accessories include a standard LEGO spear, known as the Jaba in Chima and some kind of flame spewing dagger, a dark brown telescope with a standard LEGO fire piece on top and a gold claw piece on the bottom. Honestly, the weapons aren&rsquo;t much to look at. A spear is a spear and kind of disappointing for the Phoenix tribe. And the weapon is just odd and utterly useless since you have to get really close to use it in battle.</p>

<p>The Speedor</p>

<p>The newly designed Speedor is made to resemble the on-show models more. Gone are the stud based seating arrangements and instead is a leg gripping stand like a chariot&rsquo;s seat or something. The cord goes horizontal instead of vertical to rev up the wheel for play and the super detailed individualized top pieces have been simplified to a one size fits all Tribe piece with printed detailing to indicate which tribe it&rsquo;s meant to be for.</p>

<p>In this case a phoenix face and beak are printed on the front. On the one hand I do like this simpler design, it balances better and the minifigure has a better place to stand making it look more like the show. Unfortunately the simplicity and lower piece count hurt the piece per price ratio considerably. On top of that I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of the new one-size fits all topper piece, gone are the sculpted detailing and the unique character of the Speedorz and in their place is a more uniform look.</p>

<p>I do love those new orange wing pieces though included here. The transparent orange pieces are great for MOCing some firey flying craft, or interesting architecture design, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with them.</p>

<p>The Model &amp; Cards</p>

<p>This model is really weak, it&rsquo;s basically a small ramp, two half circle flame traps, a pedestal and a stone holding thing that holds the fire chi orb included in the set. It is a really low piece count and I&rsquo;m not a fan of this type of obstacle because it limits what you can do for displaying it if you aren&rsquo;t playing the game. Also it&rsquo;s a bit of a disappointing build because it doesn&rsquo;t involve much, although I will admit it&rsquo;s a got a nice uniform thematic design for the play pattern.</p>

<p>The cards in this set represent the character, the ramp and fire traps, the pedestal containing the fire chi orb, the speedor and the weapons. The design is still nice, and I do like the artwork, but the fact that all five cards just have Fluminox&rsquo;s name on the side instead of unique names to differentiate them and help explain how to use them is a big disappointment. Also of note is that the numbering system has changed drastically, now we&rsquo;re in the 300s.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also disappointed that this set only included six standard chi crystals. By now we&rsquo;ve gotten hundreds of them and since this is a Fire based Speedorz I was expecting fire chi crystals to play with.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>The only thing to recommend this set is the fact that it is the cheapest way to own a Fluminox minifigure. The accessories he comes with here and the very lackluster obstacle build for the game are quite frankly insulting, because we&rsquo;ve seen LEGO do so much better. While I do applaud them for making a very simple and fun element to play with, I must inevitably find fault in the price per piece count because it is definitely not worth full price. If you can get it on sale and want a Flumniox with normal legs, then track this down. Otherwise it&rsquo;s safe to skip it.</p>
