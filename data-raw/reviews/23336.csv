There are a plethora of great Chima vehicles, so let&#39;s talk about how this one stacks up!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A typical box size for these Chima&nbsp;sets with very detailed&nbsp;depictions of what&#39;s inside. The instruction books&nbsp;are the usual high quality. This is one of those sets where I don&#39;t see much of a&nbsp;value in there being more than one booklet, but it has two just in case you want to attempt to have two people build it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Plenty of claw, tooth,&nbsp;and technic pieces. I like all of the translucent blue parts. There are even technic racks in translucent&nbsp;blue, which I never had before. Those huge&nbsp;discs on the side of the head (the ears?) are also a fairly rare part. As with most Chima sets, I&#39;m pleased with the part selection. 5/5, one of the set&#39;s highest points.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I love Chima&nbsp;figures, so rather than tell you how much I love them I usually evaluate them in terms of rarity.</p>

<p>If you own even a modest&nbsp;Chima&nbsp;collection, you probably already have some version of&nbsp;Gorazan. This is one of three sets to feature him in his fire gear. Gorillas in general are not that common, so I always welcome as many Gorazans as they want to throw at me. I can always pretend that the duplicates are someone else.</p>

<p>Sir Fangar has another set named after him, and appears in four sets, so he won&#39;t really turn collector&#39;s heads. That being said,&nbsp;two of his&nbsp;sets are very expensive, and the other is a Speedorz set with virtually nothing to build. For Lego fans on a budget, this is one of the best sets to get him in.</p>

<p>Stealthor&nbsp;is the most uncommon figure here, but if you just want him you might be better off getting him in Cragger&#39;s Fire Striker, since that set has the also seldom-seen Vornon.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is your typical vehicle build where you attach the appendages onto a technic base in the middle. You do repeat many of the instructions twice, and there are a few stickers to apply, but it&#39;s not tedious. If you enjoy assembling these types of vehicles, you&#39;ll have plenty of fun building the Sabre-Tooth Walker.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The legs and face look fantastic. The mouth looks so menacing that my toddler jumped back in fright when I showed it to him. I just love all the nice visible translucent blue pieces on each element. The legs have a couple articulation points each, (although they are a little stiff)&nbsp;and the mouth opens. There are some flick-fire missiles on the sides that are actually pretty easy to flick for once.</p>

<p>One thing&nbsp;I don&#39;t love&nbsp;is the back of the torso. I was surprised that I was out of pieces when the build was over. I thought I would be doing something else to the back, but&nbsp;it&#39;s just left as a&nbsp;thin set of technic racks without much decoration. The reason for this is clear: you&#39;re supposed to house Stealthor&#39;s vehicle on the back, which somewhat covers things up. The walker&#39;s back is simply used as a platform to hold and eject Stealthor. However, even that kind of falls flat for me because if Stealthor is holding his weapon, his vehicle won&#39;t eject properly, and there&#39;s not any place to store the weapon if&nbsp;you take it out of his hands.&nbsp;A little more could have been done to make the back look nicer, even when the vehicle is attached. It could have also been a bit wider so that Stealthor ejects properly every time.</p>

<p>The rest of the moving parts are okay, but nothing too exciting.&nbsp;The head can&#39;t move except for the bottom jaw.&nbsp;The legs are poseable, and the front legs can be lifted high enough to slash at things,&nbsp;but you do have to manually pose them one by one. That&#39;s always&nbsp;a potential downside of legged vehicles&nbsp;vs wheeled ones. As an example of where legged vehicles <em>can</em>&nbsp;differ in a good way,&nbsp;I really liked on Sparratus&#39; Spider Stalker where the front two legs can be easily and fluidly&nbsp;controlled simultaneously with a technic&nbsp;element.&nbsp;That might have been hard to pull off on the walker without having it fall over, but perhaps the head could have moved more or something else to make up for it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When seen from the front, and with the vehicle attached, it&#39;s a very nice looking construction that uses awesome&nbsp;pieces. The minifigures are pretty decent, and the build is fun enough.</p>

<p>The downside is the ugly rear side,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the moving elements&nbsp;leave a lot to be desired.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do still&nbsp;recommend this set, just not as highly as some of the others. I considered giving it 3/5, but I know that kids will still have fun with it, and collectors can easily display it in a way that looks amazing.&nbsp;The Sabre-Tooth Walker is&nbsp;cool enough conceptually and visually&nbsp;to overcome most of my complaints. When you look at the variety of vehicles offered in Chima and now in Nexo Knights, it&nbsp;has its place as something that is still very memorable and visually somewhat unique.</p>

"exorallan31","2022-08-22T13:14:38.427Z","Pretty good set. ","<p>Recently started reviewing some LOC and Ninjago sets, so i think this is the next one i would rewiew.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For figures, Gorzan is a very nice figure, with a very nice looking hammer. fire suits have some fine printing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stealthor. This is a pretty alright figure, just nothing special. Not a big fan of his weapon however.</p>

<p>Sir Fangar. fully armoured with a Cape, Armor and a very nice sword. Love it!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building this set was pretty fun. The legs are repetitive however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the models we have a Little Ice Cage, a Trike and the walker itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ice cage is just 3 parts, but it does what it needs to do, a tiny little cage to hold Gorzan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trike Has a pretty good design, got a spot to hold the trike for stealthor. don&#39;t like how he is leaning way back however. Otherwise, No complaints here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sabertooth walker itself. The front looks very menacing with those turret things on the side with the obligatory flick missiles. pretty easy to flick this time actually.</p>

<p>Ratcheted Joints give for some great poses, Love these pieces. always something nice to have.</p>

<p>However, the back... Argh, that&#39;s not great. Looks flat with just a tiny little tail. But there&#39;s a reason why there&#39;s so much empty space on the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So it can hold stealthor&#39;s little trike! just sits there, and you can just turn a gear to launch it. super fun feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does look kind of empty without it, but as so much of the mass is at the front, looks alright.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - Claws, Ratcheted joints, Teeth, YES!! So many good bits and pieces here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros - Great play feature, Great looking animal head, Good figures, Great poseability.</p>

<p>Cons - Back is very flat with a tiny little tail, don&#39;t like the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
