<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some of the coolest parts I have ever seen in any Lego set are included in this one. The trunk is awesome because it has a canon and some Chi on it and it really looks like a Mech arm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Pros: The minifigs all look nice. My favorite of them all is Mottrot because he just LOOKS awesome!</p>

<p>Cons: Only one con. The mammoth heads pop off really easily. They can even fall off when you&#39;re holding them.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pros: This was a very unique build because of the way they really mixed Technic and Lego bricks together. Worriz&#39; mini speeder bike was a very &quot;interesting&quot; build.</p>

<p>Cons: Worriz&#39; mini speeder bike falls apart really easily. No cons on the Mammoth stomper!</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The detachable flyer has a nice open cockpit. And I like the way that the engines flip up. Inside the belly of the Mammoth stomper, there is a little cup of water that I really got a kick out of! And I love the flip up ribcage. There is also a jail cell in back that has 2 opening doors. 1 is inside the belly, and the other is outside. The cockpit of the Mammoth stomper is really nice and open, just like the one up top.</p>

"coloagnt1","2015-03-21T06:38:24.22Z","Overall AWESOME set!!!","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong> &nbsp;The basic Lego style, fairly large to legitimately hold the 604 parts. &nbsp;Box ix not ridiculous in size!</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong> &nbsp;The parts in this set are really pretty diverse and I found them to be great additions to my collection. &nbsp;There&#39;s a&nbsp;nice selection of brown bricks and&nbsp;translucent blue bricks which compose a good majority of overall parts.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures: </strong>&nbsp;Very nice selection of unique&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;with very nice details, accessories and very cool &quot;headware&quot;, particular on the elephant tribe minifigures. &nbsp;Couple have different colored hands, one has a hook as its hand!!</p>

<p><strong>The build: </strong>&nbsp;Fun and interesting build every step of the way. &nbsp;You will not be&nbsp;bored. &nbsp;The legs can be a bit repetitive but they are quick builds.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model: &nbsp;</strong>Absolutely<strong> EXCELLENT!! &nbsp;</strong>Personally my sets are usually built and displayed, not played with. &nbsp;Having said that though, I think others purchasing this will be pleased with the sets playability. &nbsp;The detached flying unit can really be used for Chima &quot;battles&quot;! &nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Previous reviewer did mention a legitimate point, that the head of the mammoth can become easily detached. &nbsp;For this reason, the main &quot;base&quot; of the mammoth is not quite as &quot;playable&quot; as the flyer. &nbsp;The little white &quot;vehicle&quot; is forgettable and unnecessary really.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion: </strong>&nbsp;Really cool and&nbsp;different set. &nbsp;Nice selection of parts, generous assortment of minifigures. &nbsp; &nbsp;Lego did scrimp&nbsp;a little on the parts overall here and there which would have only improved and perfected a pretty great model. &nbsp;Definitely recommend this set. &nbsp;One of my &quot;random&quot; unplanned Lego purchases that I&#39;ve ended up&nbsp;very happy with!!!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-13T18:18:16.517Z","Maula's Masterful Magestic Mastodon.","<p><strong>Set #70145 Maula&rsquo;s Ice Mammoth Stomper: </strong>&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re a fan of walkers and mechs than you&rsquo;re going to love the ice mammoth stomper. It is one of the best vehicles from the Fire Tribe era of Legends of Chima in my opinion and while it does use many stickers for details, and it does seem to be hollow inside it&rsquo;s still a great looking set. And I&rsquo;m going to explain why in this review.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: I like the design of this box for this set. It is a nicely detailed beast with a shot of Maula&rsquo;s face in the upper corner. The fire tribe box colours do a great job of standing out on the shelf. The action shot on the front also really sells this set. Honestly it&rsquo;s why I really wanted this set and went out of my way to pick it up as one of my first Fire Tribe era sets.</p>

<p>The back also does a good job showing all the play features, especially the biggest selling point of the set, the detachable vehicle.</p>

<p>Instructions: Breaking up the build into two manuals and through six numbered bags is what you&rsquo;ll find here. Booklet one features bags 1-3 and is a smaller sized manual compared to the second booklet, which has you working on bags 4-6. Both manuals are protected by cardboard backing, as is the sticker sheet included with this set, so you won&rsquo;t have to worry about damaged paperwork.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear and precise, as we&rsquo;ve come to expect from LEGO manuals, there are no tricky or difficult steps in the process of construction. I would caution placement of stickers however, as there may be issues with certain areas, especially when applying to the clear blue pieces on the walker&rsquo;s legs, as transparent stickers on transparent pieces are not always easily identifiable for which one goes where if you&rsquo;re building quickly.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set features a wide selection of parts, you&rsquo;ll find some nice transparent blue pieces in a light icy tone, shoulder armour, cockpit windows, rib bones and others including the 1x4 smooth plates. There is also a nice selection of brown pieces and a Constraction chest plate in this colour is used quite creatively for the Mammoth&rsquo;s face. All in all a pretty decent parts pack.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Maula: As one of a handful of female characters in Minifigure form Maula is a great addition to the Minifigure collection from Legends of Chima. What I find truly impressive is the double-sided torso print. Maula is wearing classic Viking inspired clothing, even her leg printing matches with the Viking style of the Ice Tribe. Her double-sided head has a serious facial expression and a surprised one.</p>

<p>Maula&rsquo;s weapon is a mammoth (pun intended) cannon. It&rsquo;s such a massive accessory that it unfortunately makes her a bit top heavy. However it can be stored on the forehead of the mammoth mech making it looking quite menacing. Overall she&rsquo;s a great minifig and looks stunning, I&rsquo;m pleased she was created as part of the Ice Tribe.</p>

<p>Mottrot: The mammoth tribe is a sub-tribe of the ice tribes and is very impressive. It has three members, the matriarch, the muscle and the brains. Mottrot is the runt of the liter and has a regular Minifigure body. He has the ice armour piece in transparent blue with a CHI stud, a double-sided torso print with one clear arm, leg printing with one clear leg and a double-sided facial print. This print isn&rsquo;t obvious, the facial expressions are fairly difficult to figure out, one is angry with furrowed eyebrows while the other is generic.</p>

<p>The new sculpted head piece is extremely impressive, and I have a difficult time figuring out just what they could re-use it for. This is an elephant head piece with two proud ivory tusks and a long trunk, the trunk is missing the flesh at the end, leaving a bony protrusion for the tip of the trunk. It also has a few patches of visible innards with the typical ice tribe decaying print.</p>

<p>His weapon is a large double-bladed scythe or glaive like weapon using the beak pieces for Raven tribe vehicles. It&rsquo;s a massive weapon that renders him quite top heavy, but looks suitably menacing.</p>

<p>Vornon: This dangerous looking vulture from the Ice Tribe has the familiar printing we&rsquo;ve come to expect from Legends of Chima, his torso is a double-sided print and his legs include printing. The vulture head piece is I believe the same purple colouring as others, with some printing on top showing his skull has been stapled together to keep it from falling apart due to the rotting nature of the ice tribe members. Very gruesome.</p>

<p>He includes transparent armour, grey wings, a transparent leg and a transparent arm. His weapon is a space blaster with a cylinder piece attached, relatively barebones as far as accessories are concerned. His face is a single-sided one with printing showing off his grim facial expression, it looks strange when not wearing the headpiece because he should have a beak. Not much more to say than that.</p>

<p>Strainor: This member of the ice tribe is a Saber-Tooth Tiger, he includes some highly detailed printing on his torso, which is double-sided showing off armour, his legs are also printed and one is a transparent blue, covered over in ice. Muscle is visible on the print as well as on his head piece which features printing of decaying flesh due to the frozen nature of these long ago creatures.</p>

<p>His face is double-sided with two distinct expressions, though both do look highly similar, the only difference being the width of his eyes. His accessories include transparent blue shoulder armour and a large claw weapon sculpted in the shape of a cat&rsquo;s paw with three small black teeth inserted for claws and a clear blue SNOT stud for Chi powering up effect. All-in-all an interesting weapon, though a bit large making him top heavy when not attached to studs.</p>

<p>Razar: The Raven Tribe member includes his brand new fire armour. He has a double-sided torso print, leg printing, gold armour, a double-sided facial print and the familiar head piece with printing we&rsquo;ve come to expect from this character. His weapon is a Ninjago hilt piece and a new flame piece that you build, and he has a Fire Chi printed stud on his chest. Overall a great new take on the character.</p>

<p>However I must caution you as this version of Razar seems to have a weaker hook hand piece, my first one broke after holding the weapon for a while, it was also much too tight in the wrist socket of the original torso. So I&rsquo;d have to say he might be more prone to breaking than earlier iterations of the Minifigure.</p>

<p>Worriz: Also in this set we have another fire armour clad version of Worriz. This one has gold shoulder armour, whereas the one in the polybag did not. I am slightly disappointed that LEGO decided to make all of the fire armour prints identical. There is nothing different between the prints on Razar or Worriz to indicate their unique characteristics or tribes. His weapon is a bit strange, it&rsquo;s an old school Space blaster with a red transparent cylinder included.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Bag 1: Here we find very little build, we have four of the Minifigures included in this set, Worriz&rsquo; small fire powered vehicle and the lower half of the main body for the walker, which is very minimal in piece counts. There isn&rsquo;t much here and it looks very minimal.</p>

<p>Bag 2: This however helps to build up the main body of the walker and gives you a bit more to build on top of what you start with bag 1, however there are a lot of Technic pieces used in this main part of construction. The rear section includes a small one-minifigure prison, the central area includes a pillar where the CHI crystal sits to power up the walker, the front section includes a control station and small desk to place your cup when drinking, indeed it even includes one. This build does a great job of fleshing out the main torso of the model and is fast and fun to build.</p>

<p>Bag 3: Here we get the head of the walker, which is built quite cleverly, using some interesting parts to make an actual mammoth style head and cockpit section for Maula. I am a huge fan of the clever design elements used to build this model&rsquo;s head. The bag also includes Maula and her weapon in this build. Note there are stickers used on the ear pieces, caution should be taken when applying them as the pieces are rather large and the stickers can easily be damaged if not handled carefully.</p>

<p>Bag 4: A bit repetitive here as we get into the leg builds, which requires you to build two of each leg. More stickers are used for detail work here, and the parts are transparent blue which can cause slight problems when applying them as any fingerprints will be visible easily.</p>

<p>Bag 5: Here we start to build the escape craft/assault craft, secondary vehicle. It is an interesting design, the build involves the main body in this bag and the steps aren&rsquo;t too difficult to follow along. The overall design of the body could be either an aerial vehicle or one design to traverse under the ocean depths, it is meant to become the large fur covered hump commonly associated with Mammoth&rsquo;s above their front shoulder blades, and the build does a passable job of making it. Stickers for detailing can be found here again, this time mostly on brown sloped pieces, placement can be slightly tricky.</p>

<p>Bag 6: Here we have the last section of build, the large VTOL engines and some cannons that become part of the secondary vehicle, the VTOL engines are a repetitive build since you follow the same steps for both of them. They also are quite large, almost Helicarrier large in their design. They will cover up the shoulder blades on the front legs and can be a bit finicky as you build them, I recall some minor lacking of clutch power until everything was finished properly and attached together. All in all a fast build, nothing really more to say about it honestly.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Worriz&rsquo; Fire Vehicle: This is a nice looking miniature model. It uses very few pieces, and suffers slightly from awkward design placement for the single wheel, however it&rsquo;s a nicer looking miniature vehicle compared to the fire bike in my opinion. If only because this looks like it&rsquo;d barely stand a chance against Maula&rsquo;s Ice Mammoth Stomper, so the fact that Worriz is using it just ups the cool factor. There are a pair of stickers for detailing instead of printed pieces sadly.</p>

<p>Maula&rsquo;s Ice Mammoth Stomper: When it comes to walker mech designs the most memorable and notorious is the AT-AT walker from Star Wars. This in no way matches the level of detail of a LEGO AT-AT, however it does have its own charm. It resembles a mammoth quite well, the head design of the model is very elephant-like, the design incorporates some nice pieces for the trunk and forehead, specifically it uses the Constration chest piece for the frontal face area of the elephant.</p>

<p>The design of the mech unfortunately hinders the movement of the head, it can move up and down. The trunk makes it top heavy unfortunately so you can&rsquo;t keep the head up, the many segments of the ball-jointed trunk however can be moved to accommodate any number of interesting poses.</p>

<p>The legs are designed for multiple different poses, and can maintain the weight of the model, which isn&rsquo;t too terribly difficult, a big love it or hate it part of this model is the fact that it is quite hollow, with a fully open area in the central torso and mostly technic bricks used for the bulk of the torso. Part of the reason for this is to allow for internal playset areas, a small control cabin area with mug, a prison with the unique ice piece in back and a central weapon storage divider for the prison and the command area. The other reason for the hollowness of the build is because of its 2-1 nature. The entire top of the mammoth can detach and turn into a massive flying assault craft.</p>

<p>This vehicle is a fairly solid chunky looking one, using the large semi-circle pieces as front shoulders for the main model and hover engines for the VTOL style assault/escape vehicle.</p>

<p>Nine clear blue rib pieces are used, two for tusks, six for ribs and the final one for the tail, which I feel is situated slightly higher on the model than it would/should on a real animal of this type. There are two flick-fire missiles under the engines for the VTOL craft for play features. Stickers are used for details on the ears, legs and some sections of the VTOL craft as well.</p>

<p>Overall the main mammoth model is up to taste, I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the look of it thoroughly, however not everybody might enjoy the open hollowness of the build. The VTOL craft is really impressive, if a bit on the ungainly and top heavy side due to the big engines. The use of clear blue for the iced/frozen over parts and the two different shades of brown really make this model stand out to me, and I am quite impressed with the level of detail for a walker style build.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I strongly recommend picking this set up if you haven&rsquo;t done so already and are a fan of Legends of Chima. This right here stands out as the pen-ultimate vehicle design of the Ice Tribe forces and really looks the part. It has great playability and function, the build is a real treat as you slowly work on making it all up, and the Minifigures are all gems. If you aren&rsquo;t a fan of the Theme I can safely say you may not like the vehicle due to the sheer level of Technic build styles and lack of substance, the model is very open compared to the AT-AT from star wars, there are no panels to cover the middle and so you don&rsquo;t see the number of pieces used here. The open nature of the set makes you think there are less pieces involved than actually come with the set. For this reason, those who aren&rsquo;t fans probably won&rsquo;t like it, but for everybody else this set is a must own one that is already slated for retirement as of the writing of this review.</p>

"TheBigBB","2016-04-12T08:50:26.94Z","The ultimate ice vehicle and a worthy flagship set","<p>Maula&#39;s Ice Stomper Mammoth is&nbsp;the ultimate vehicle for the ice-themed Chima sets, and clearly&nbsp;the flagship set for the ice theme, given&nbsp;its price point. This might seem&nbsp;odd at first glance, because this set doesn&#39;t even have close to the most pieces in this theme. In fact, there&#39;s a set with more pieces that has a&nbsp;$40 cheaper MSRP:&nbsp;Icebite&#39;s Claw Driller. You might guess, then, that what this mammoth lacks in pieces it makes for in piece size...and you would be right. I don&#39;t know if there could ever be a way to sort Lego sets based on average piece size, but if there were, the&nbsp;mammoth would be relatively high on the list, especially amongst sets within the Chima&nbsp;theme.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>One of the larger boxes in the theme, with a really great picture on the cover. I love these Chima boxes where they show you all the things you can do with the set. You do get two instruction manuals so two people can work on it, and the directions are very clear as you can almost always expect from Lego.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Huge pieces and rare pieces galore. I always love all the translucent blue pieces on the ice sets. The technic elements are fairly straightforward, leaving fewer pegs and small bits than you see even&nbsp;on much smaller sets, adding to the average piece size. This is the second Chima set I own that has these large rounded corners that you see on the mammoth&#39;s shoulders (they serve as the wings of the detachable vehicle, too). The other set being Gorzan&#39;s Gorilla Striker. I think those pieces are pretty cool to have.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Mottrot and Maula both appear in this and the Mammoth Fortress set. The mammoth tribe figures&nbsp;are fantastic, and they alone make the minifigures in this set worthwhile. Their helmets are some of the largest you&#39;ll ever see on a Lego figure.</p>

<p>Vornon appears in only a few sets, and this is the most expensive. He&#39;s a pretty ugly figure, but he&#39;s supposed to be.</p>

<p>Razar&nbsp;is one of the more common characters, but this is only the second set where he&#39;s in his fire attire.</p>

<p>Worriz is one of Chima&#39;s main characters and is super common in both his original and his fire gear.</p>

<p>Strainor&nbsp;is similar to Worriz except he seems to be a perpetual antagonist.</p>

<p>Anyway, despite the common figures, the mammoths make up for it. Chima&nbsp;fans will pretty much need to have one of the two mammoth sets for these guys.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>After you&#39;re done building Worriz&#39;s&nbsp;pathetic vehicle,&nbsp;while still on bag 1, you move right into the large mammoth. You build the mammoth on all 6 bags, so well over 500 of the set&#39;s 604 pieces are going into it.</p>

<p>This is your basic modern vehicle build where you attach appendages onto a technic core. There are a lot of stickers to apply, and you repeat a lot of directions. If those things aren&#39;t a downside to you, then you&#39;ll have fun with the build. I just liked seeing all the cool pieces I was using on each step. For the size of the legs, building 4 of them isn&#39;t as tedious&nbsp;as I thought it might be. All four legs get built in one bag. Compare that to the detachable vehicle on the top which takes up all of bags 5 and 6.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Truly massive, and awesome. By the time you&#39;re done with this, you&#39;ll forget all about the terrible vehicle you built&nbsp;for Worriz. Who cares about that when the mammoth vehicle&nbsp;is so huge and amazing?</p>

<p>I like that I&nbsp;was able to easily fit all the figures onto the mammoth without much fiddling around.&nbsp;I just had to be creative with the gargantuan weapons that Mottrot and Maula have. For Mottrot, I had him put his weapon on one of the weapon pegs on the mammoth&#39;s side which are supposed to have spears. For Maula and his enormous gun, I decided&nbsp;to have him sitting behind the mammoth&#39;s head, while Strainor piloted it.</p>

<p>Despite the low number of technic elements compared to other vehicles, the set has a lot of moving parts. The trunk moves along many joints. The head can go up and down. The legs move in a couple places each. The vehicle on top can detach, and its wings move. The guns on it also can pivot. The butt opens up to a prison, which also has a door on the inside.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite the low piece count for the price, the mammoth is deserving of being one of the flagship&nbsp;Chima sets. It looks extremely imposing, and most people will probably notice it and comment on it well before they look at most of your other&nbsp;sets. The mammoth minifigures are great, the set has a lot of playability, and it&#39;s a solid build that won&#39;t come apart too easily. I really like this set and I think it&#39;s one you can&#39;t pass up if you&#39;re a fan of&nbsp;Chima. I mean, I would even recommend the set to people who hate Chima, but that might be pushing it a little bit.</p>
