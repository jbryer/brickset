<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><img src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DMVbP6klDlI/U1ap_dLdLaI/AAAAAAAAFXo/U4GL4YLPAj4/s1600/70146b.jpg"" style=""height: 200px; width: 300px;"" />&nbsp;Box is pretty big. But view at it is amazing. When the new Lego Chima&nbsp;Season 3 sets came out, I was very interested in them, because there was new &quot;photo&quot;&nbsp;on bottom of the box-Enter Fire CHI Power Mode. So... Looked at some reviews and then thought, that it could be amazing new set for my Chima collection. And there was some icy vehicle, which also is very amazing. About them- further.</p>

<p>Big Phoenix vehicle is called Flaming Bastion.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has 1301 pieces. I guess that until this moment it&#39;s largest set in Chima series. Many pretty cool parts, really like those red coloured pieces. Phoenix&#39;s head is truly amazing- those eyes (who for me looks like some powerful golden weapons) are statisfying. Really like Stealhtors&nbsp;vehicles icy claws. And of course the Temple walls bricks. Those sand yellow kinda real bricks are truly amazing. There aren&#39;t a lot of them, but doesn&#39;t change that they are amazing.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Set has 7 new amazing minifigs.</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/loc075.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 200px;"" />Phoenix tribe leader Fluminox. A brand new tribe.&nbsp;Really like his armor, very shiny piece which shows his power. In this set Fluminox is in robe, he is using Fire CHI. I also like his wings.</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/loc077.jpg"" style=""height: 200px; width: 150px;"" />Fluminox&#39;s son Flinx. Very like using of fire as his wings, makes him look more realistic. Uses Fire CHI. Has classic Chima armor.</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/loc076.jpg"" style=""height: 200px; width: 150px;"" />Captain of Flaming Bastion. Created from dark red pieces, his armor is like those who showed up on Season 2. (Like Lavertus has).</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/loc073.jpg"" style=""height: 200px; width: 150px;"" />New tribe again. This is Tiger tribe member Tormak. He is Fluminox&#39;s best friend. One of strongest warriors in Land of CHIMA.&nbsp;<br />
<img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/loc079.jpg"" style=""height: 200px; width: 150px;"" />For this one I personally I was waiting a most. This isn&#39;t any new tribe. It&#39;s lion tribe member. But as far as it was until Season 3 there were only lion males, but this lion is female. Lionesse&nbsp;Li&#39;Ella. She doesn&#39;t have any new armor, but her pieces ar AMAZING. When Laval sees Li&#39;Ella he falls in love in her, and later they are togheter, but Tormak&nbsp;(which is her stepfather) doesn&#39;t like it.</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/loc078.jpg"" style=""height: 200px; width: 150px;"" />And new tribe. Stealthor is Saber-Tooth tribe member. Has classic armor, but it is icy. Also has ice hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/loc074.jpg"" style=""height: 200px; width: 150px;"" />And last minifig. New tribe again. Voom Voom is leader of Vulture tribe. Has same armor as Foltrax only this one is icy blue just like Stealthor. Has frozen foot.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building was very interesting. I made up many mistakes but in ending the model was done. Building a temple was very easy. Much harder was building Flaming Bastion. It has got very amazing Technic and I really enjoyed building it. Building Stealthor&#39;s vehicle was not anything hard, but it&#39;s harder than temple of course.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><strong>Flaming Bastion</strong></p>

<p>That vehicle is something FASCINATING. At beggining&nbsp;vehicle is part of temple. It holds up because it&#39;s cannons are in special spots. Then you pull its head.... And it becomes fully different thing. From wall it becomes a massive, beautiful, armored Phoenix. Bird has tail from fire, cannons, at the bottom there is place where you can place Fire CHI balls and open up storage and they fall down bombarding enemies. When battle is over pull it back and place it in its spot back.</p>

<p><strong>Temple</strong></p>

<p>I was waiting for a higher walls, but that doesn&#39;t change fact that it looks amazing. Really love gates. Also really like those fiery torches. Fire Balls pool makes place more interesting and plants on walls also are amazing decorations.<img src=""http://kubik-mir.by/images/stories/virtuemart/product/701463.png"" style=""height: 150px; width: 300px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>Stealthor&#39;s&nbsp;Vechicle&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In small size, but it&#39;s functions... Incredible stuff. It has got icy, movable claws. From back of set you push brick and those hands attack everything what is in front of it. Also has cannons. And from vehicle you can separate little plane. It&#39;s wings in whole vehicle are together with plane, but when you separate&nbsp;plane you can make cool wings. Cannons stay together with plane, but claws do not.&nbsp;<img src=""http://mytoyshop.com.sg/image/cache/data/70146---15-500x500.jpg"" style=""height: 150px; width: 200px;"" /><img src=""https://klotsipood.ee/files/product_full/eaorzz537dd90c71ba1.jpg"" style=""height: 143px; width: 200px;"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Nice box, amazing minifigs, cool parts, new tribes, amazing functions... what else can we want. This set is&nbsp;amazing. It 100% values it cost. Really, really like this set.</p>
