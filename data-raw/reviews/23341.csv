This is one of few sets that doesn&rsquo;t fit in with the Jungle Rescue Theme. And it&rsquo;s a really neat little set, read on to find out my thoughts on this set.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: My thoughts on the Friends box designs are well known from countless other reviews. This box design has been so well received I feel that it hardly changes much from year to year. I will say though that it might be nice to see them make a different colour for the sub-themes.</p>

<p>Instructions: The same could be said of these. Not much to say aside from their easy to follow steps and the usual cross-promotional images in the back. Standard instructions from these sets.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Love the parts in this set, loads of purple and pink pieces and a light brown cross piece. It&rsquo;s a great new piece that has tons of uses. You only get one in this set though, which I suppose that makes it a bit rare.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Andrea:&nbsp; This version of Andrea is wearing a nice light-blue top with some floral printing and a pair of light purple pants&hellip; Or perhaps they&rsquo;re dark rose. It&rsquo;s a nice combination and I like the look of her &lsquo;camp-out&rsquo; uniform. She includes a red mug, a printed map tile from the Pirates Theme, a camera and of course the marshmallow on a stick which is fun.</p>

<p>Really fun looking Mini-Doll in this set.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>In this set you&rsquo;re building three things. Two mini-models and one main model. The build is quick and easy for the mini-models and really fun for the main model. There are no stickers in this set and no numbered bags, so you&rsquo;re basically separating the pieces from the bags before you start the building.</p>

<p>The hanging lamp is a fun micro-build. The technique has been used in other sets, however the real fun is making the little hut because the walls are nice and solid. You won&rsquo;t find any difficult steps in this set though.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The mountain hut is an awesome looking model. It&rsquo;s a three-sided open air building that is more of a place to sit and keep yourself dry from the rain while out camping in the mountains. You can sit your mini-doll either on the dark rose bench outside or the orange bed on the inside. There&rsquo;s a small stool for the squirrel included inside the set next to some flowers on a small green plate.</p>

<p>The campfire is a simple little build and Andrea seems to be boiling some water to cook with, as inside of the pot is a clear stud.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I really dig this set. It&rsquo;s a nice little set from summer 2014 and includes an impressive model with a lot of potential fun for playing with. There aren&rsquo;t a tone of gimmicky features, but that&rsquo;s the beauty of the set. This is more of a little camp site where Andrea goes on the side of Heartlake Mountain. It isn&rsquo;t meant to be an exciting gimmick loaded set. So I&rsquo;m going to strongly recommend picking up this set, it&rsquo;s really fun to play with and fun to build.</p>
