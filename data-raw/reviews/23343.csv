<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and instructions are pretty straight forward and do a good job of showing off the tiger and, best of all, the chameleon. I wish they would eventually change the packaging of the Friends to not scream quite so &quot;girly&quot;, but I&#39;m sure that&#39;s a marketing thing that shall never be overcome.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with a couple of awesome animals, which carry the Friends line in my opinion, but also a vine, gemstone and trans blue waterfall piece that are a great addition to any collection. Most of the pieces are really useful, with very little pink or pastel, which is such a breath of fresh air.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This comes with 1 Olivia fig in an outfit that is still al ittle too &quot;girly&quot; for the jungle, but maybe not as much as usual. The walkie talkie is a nice accessory.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>My 6 year old daughter built this by herself; I didn&#39;t really watch her do it, so can only judge by her testement. She finished it in a day and only messed up once, but otherwise had no problem doing it by herself.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is really fun when added with the other jungle theme sets, though has limited play by itself. The best part is the sliding waterfall, which is really fun and clever, even if it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense. Who doesn&#39;t want a sliding waterfall door?!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a really great set for the money. It is small, but it&#39;s about the right price for the number of pieces, and some of the specialty pieces make it an even better value. There&#39;s more playability than expected with such a small set. The sliding waterfall and hanging vine invite you to play with it instead of just adding it in somewhere for decoration. I&#39;m really excited for the jungle subtheme as my daughter and I (her mother) have had enough pink pandering with the Friends sets. I like most of them for the animals and some of the parts, but it&#39;s nice to finally see the girls going on some real adventures. My daughter does not necessarily prefer the Friends over the other Lego sets, but after acquiring this and the Bridge Rescue set, she started showing interest in her other Friends sets again. As an aside, my 2 year old son likes this one, too.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-12-15T21:48:05.3Z","Welcome to a Jungle Heartlake Adventure","<p><strong>Set #41033 Jungle Falls Rescue: </strong>Time for another jaw dropping drop dead gorgeously designed LEGO Friends set to discuss. Believe me this set is a real treat and a nice 25$ set from the Friends Theme to track down if you haven&rsquo;t already bought it. We&rsquo;ll discuss why during the course of the review, one thing to note though is that there will be stickers.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is a nicely designed one, with some new jungle themed artwork of flowers and trees bordering the images of the set on the front and back. It stands out quite nicely on the shelf and draws your eye. It also shows all of the features of the set on the back in a very fun little way, really impressed all around.</p>

<p>The instructions are the same we&rsquo;ve seen before from this Theme. With excellent step-by-step building instructions that are easy to follow. The back few pages are your standard LEGO Friends cross-promotional images. For this new sub-theme they&rsquo;ve changed things up a little, the picture for the sets shows them all around the Heartlake Jungle and you even get a picture showing how to put all the sets together in a neat looking display that combines all of the sub-theme together. I love the production value and design of the LEGO Friends manuals and wish that some of it would be incorporated into other Themes.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set includes some great transparent blue pieces, there&rsquo;s a BURP to simulate the falling water effect and a few studs and studless plates, you also get an awesome looking light blue/teal baseplate, and the usual pieces found in a LEGO Friends set. Curiously enough this one has a load of standard medium and light grey pieces for the rocky area next to the waterfall.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Olivia: This set includes the Mini-Doll Olivia from the Jungle Sub-Theme of LEGO Friends. I like her, the legs are in a nice olive green skirt piece and the torso is a sleeveless purple &lsquo;business suit&rsquo; top with the logo for the Jungle Rescue Aid unit the Friends are operating. It&rsquo;s a nice change from the one included in the small Jungle Boat polybag.</p>

<p>She comes with the same light orange walkie talkie accessory as well as a bone for the trapped tiger cub (personally I think the cub might prefer a CMF Butcher T-Bone to be honest) and a round tile printed with the life preserver that most Friends sets include. Not bad accessories by any stretch and fit the theme of the set quite nicely.</p>

<p>Also included are two animals, a young tiger which is the same from the Animals Series and a new chameleon piece, which is cute as she/he blends into the surrounding foliage by changing from green to purple.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The set is built using the numbered bag method, each part of the build is separated by two numbered bags. The first bag builds the main rocky section and the jungle falls, while the second bag builds the small jungle base which the Friends use to have a bite to eat in between missions.</p>

<p>The build is pretty impressive actually, there are a lot interesting steps and some nice gimmicks incorporated into the set. Admittedly there are BURPs used in certain areas instead of bricks, however they don&rsquo;t really hinder the overall look of the set. The fun thing is how the waterfall is built, you basically attach the clear blue BURP to a sliding piece that moves in and out, so you can have the waterfall effect slide in behind the rock wall as if it were a secret doorway/passage. While on top of the waterfall a small gate is built up to mimic a dam effect explaining why the water vanishes. It&rsquo;s all incorporated using some geared slider pieces that work very well and make the entire play gimmick function without any tricky building steps.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This model has a great look to it. The build was satisfying and the finished product doesn&rsquo;t disappoint. Some might think it&rsquo;s a bit one-sided because there is such a large empty space, however that just adds to the look of the set making it appear to be on the edge of a large lake or fast moving river. The use of flowers and vines and leaves everywhere make it stand out as a decent looking jungle set. And the eating area with the large pink awning to shade the Friends from the sun is a nice touch. Although I must admit the seating arrangements do look a bit cramped.</p>

<p>The play feature for the set is also rather nice, the sliding waterfall gimmick works as intended and hidden underneath the eating are is an open cavern that the Friends can access by going through the open waterfall cave, where they find a special light green crystal or jewel hidden from sight.</p>

<p>The little raft that the poor tiger cub is trapped on is also cute.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I strongly recommend this set, the model is a nice change of pace from some of what we&rsquo;ve seen in past themes and sets and it isn&rsquo;t every day you get to build a small jungle like area. By combining all the sets together from this sub-theme you get a really impressive, cohesive looking display piece with a lot of potential fun to be had by the younger fans.</p>

<p>Also the mini-doll and animals included in the set are must have for any Friends collector.</p>
