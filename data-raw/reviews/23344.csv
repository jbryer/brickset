<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>My major reason for huge delight is the amazing wealth of medium azure parts in this set.&nbsp; It includes FIFTEEN different elements in medium azure, totalling to 49 of those various elements in all.&nbsp; I have never seen so much azure before in my LEGO life, and I&#39;m a believer.</p>

<p>In addition to just the cool new color thing (which is major, mind you!) it also offers a nice assortment of relatively hard-to-find, newer parts:&nbsp; a small curved windscreen; two bar holders with clip (bricklink #11090), which are used to support the camping trailer in case you want to tool off in your convertible to get supplies or something; three of the nice 2x4 tiles, and various curved slopes/no studs, which help to give both the trailer and the convertible nice rounded lines.</p>

<p>Downside, though, it&#39;s a bit stickery overall, but you don&#39;t have to use them if you don&#39;t want to, and several go onto the inside surface of panels, which leaves them usable for other builds.&nbsp; For US $30, I found this a really good value.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two Friends minifigs in the set and an animal.&nbsp; Nice animal choice for camping (a hedgehog) and along with familiar Friend Olivia, there&#39;s her friend Joanna, who is a very cute figure, in capri pants and crop top.&nbsp; I like her hair especially, which I personally haven&#39;t seen before.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was surprising how much fun the build was.&nbsp; I like 6-stud-wide cars &amp; trucks, and this had two of them -- a compact little curvy roadster with some interesting handling of the problem with the legs of Friends.&nbsp; The ball &amp; socket connection from the car to the trailer was positioned at a good height, and I like the support solution when the camper is detached -- very elegant and simple.</p>

<p>And the camper itself incorporates a hinged side, external storage for the campsite furniture on top of the van, and two bed surfaces that can pull out and become sleeping bags when the Friends want to watch the meteor shower.</p>

<p>Under the bed surface you have storage for most of the endless Friends accessory items -- I know if I were a kid, I&#39;d cherish these little dots of realism, but I have to admit I&#39;m kind of jaded as an adult, and I&#39;m tired of so many of them.&nbsp; This group comes with stickered food items on plates &amp; frypan, but it also includes two pink swirly ice creams/puddings, and who doesn&#39;t like that?</p>

<p>Finally, there are lots of functional things built inside the van -- a shower, a sink, a coffee maker (I think), beds, the aforementioned storage areas, and even a window garden.&nbsp; If I were playing Friends with some kid pals, I would get a nice cozy feeling from this set, but with a bit of independence and adventure thrown in.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A surprisingly good deal, with great colors, nice building ideas and execution, lots of playability, and good accessibility to the various play areas of the set.&nbsp; The tiny lump of nature is kind of meh -- I think a three-year-old designer could have done a better job -- but they tried.&nbsp; And overall, the set is full of enough plusses that I&#39;m seriously considering buying another one for all that medium azure goodness....</p>
