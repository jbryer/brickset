<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>New Jungle graphics, such as one green flange, one purple -- both outlined in Bamboo. It also shows actions scenes on the box back.&nbsp; Two instruction booklets and 3 bags of bricks/elements, plus on 8x16 baseplate in Medium Azure are included.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>New slopes in Medium Lavender: both inverted and smooth. New stretcher harness; new rubbery Lime Vine piece; new flower color (bright red violet). Helicopter bubble canopy and rotor-blades new for Friends.</p>

<h3>Mini-Dolls:</h3>

<p>Mia is wearing a new shirt with the Jungle Rescue logo; Matthew mini-doll in new Khaki shirt</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>First you build the Jeep, then the Helicopter, then the left side of rocky area with cave, then the right side with rocky cliff and cave -- then the Bridge (while leaving it &#39;broken&#39; in your build process). The Jeep is a solid build and can seat 2, although steering column is in center (the existing yellow column with black wheel); it has the traditional Lavender Friends color, with a nice Lime strips all around.</p>

<p>The Helicopter has a solid cockpit section and a bubble canopy (windshield) with rotating main rotor and tail rotor. The skids are very solid. A winch using technic parts attaches on the side for stretcher lowering and raising.&nbsp; It&#39;s a cool play feature for sure!</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>The rocky areas are fun to build with various slope bricks in different grays and tan (which helps to follow instructions); they include &#39;hidden&#39; areas for gems. This also adds to play/storyline adaptation to this set.&nbsp; The Helicopter is swooshable, just make sure the technic axle piece is pushed all the way into receiving brick&#39;s slot.&nbsp; The stretcher&#39;s harness is made form the same rubbery material as Mini-Doll hair pieces.&nbsp; The bear cub is cute.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>For fans who want a bit more action, this is a perfect set. The Jungle setting may be more attractive to the adventurous type of fan, yet most Friends fans like their Animals -- and rescuing one can be hard to resist.&nbsp; Several building techniques will help fans when they re-build with their own ideas.</p>

<p>This set combined with any or all other Jungle sets would make for a very fun setting to play, or build a diorama.</p>

<p>This entire Jungle sub-theme within Friends is certainly branching out for the characters&#39; roles, as well as a setting beyond Heartlake City.</p>

<p>The building techniques of this set should make any LEGO fan happy and satisfied.</p>
