It is your same basic LEGO Advent Calendar that we&rsquo;ve come to expect from LEGO, that is to say hit or miss when it comes to the contents.</p>

<p>Box</p>

<p>The box is gorgeous, say what you will about the mini-models and such LEGO knows how to make a beautiful holiday themed box. The advent calendar shows a great little scene with Ewa and Mia sitting in the front room of what appears to be a log cabin not far from Heartlake City. There&rsquo;s a Christmas tree, hanging cookie decorations, a fireplace with stockings and tons of other impressive holiday goodies. Only six of the included models are shown on the picture.</p>

<p>The back shows the basic gist of what you&rsquo;re supposed to do with this advent calendar, some extra scenes featuring the mini-dolls and some cross-promotional images of the Friends line. Opening the flap reveals the 24 doors, full of images featuring the complete interior of the house, which I suppose isn&rsquo;t a log cabin, it just has a log cabin living room wall deco. It&rsquo;s a lovely looking box, and some fans might want to just keep it pristine due to the detailed artwork.</p>

<p>Advent Models</p>

<p>Day 1: Mia</p>

<p>This is a cute little Mini-Doll with a light purple jacket and long blue scarf on her torso. Her legs are dark blue with tan shoes. Mia is a nice holiday themed version and great for the first day.</p>

<p>Day 2: Christmas Sled</p>

<p>This micro build is cute and a pleasant model to find behind door number 2, it uses a decent amount of pieces and looks great. It gives you something for Mia to do, which is always appreciated and works good for a strong opener to the calendar.</p>

<p>Day 3: Basket &amp; Present:</p>

<p>Four pieces. Yeah this is not as well as the previous two days. The basket is purple and the standard accessory found in LEGO Friends sets while the present is two 2x2 plates and a flower topper. It isn&rsquo;t the worst thing you could find behind the door, however I would have preferred seeing at least a bit more substance. Maybe something to go inside the basket, or at least two presents to have more of a build.</p>

<p>Day 4: Fawn &amp; Tree:</p>

<p>This one also has only 4 pieces, but the micromodel behind this door is at least fun looking and you have a little fawn to play with. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a strong offering from the calendar and at least offers loads more to play with compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Day 5: Window with Wreath:</p>

<p>This is a fun little set piece and loads more fun to build. The wreath looks nice and the window is an interesting looking micromodel. It doesn&rsquo;t do much, I mean it&rsquo;s not like you can build it into a house or connect it to one. It does tie directly into the full theme either, the Theme for this Advent Calendar being a Christmas Dinner with many of the models tying into this.</p>

<p>Day 6: Ewa</p>

<p>Another Friend for Heartlake City. Ewa is dressed in a festive skirt with red leggings and a red winter jacket with pink trim and a pink scarf. It&rsquo;s a nice mini-doll, I just wish LEGO would give us more of them, and if she&rsquo;s supposed to be like the Santa characters in other Themes why is she on Day 6? Nothing wrong with her, and she does give you another mini-doll to play with in a festive attire, I just don&rsquo;t understand why we can&rsquo;t get maybe three or four in the calendar?</p>

<p>Day 7: Kitchen Table</p>

<p>Now we begin the Christmas Dinner theme of the calendar. This table is a solid build and has a nice red and pink tablecloth on top using 1x4 plates to simulate one. There isn&rsquo;t much to do with it just yet, but it looks nice and you&rsquo;ll soon have more to do with it.</p>

<p>Day 8: Kitchen Chairs</p>

<p>You get two chairs today for the table, they are a nice pink in colour with red legs. The pair of them can sit at either end of the table, and completes the look quite nicely. Furniture is always useful for Mini-Dolls.</p>

<p>Day 9: Centerpiece</p>

<p>This is a cute little centerpiece for the table, it unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t have many pieces, but it looks very nice, much like a Christmas candle with a wreath to sit on. It&rsquo;s a nice little model that you can put on the middle of the table and continue to build up the little scene of a nice holiday dinner.</p>

<p>Day 10: Kitchen Accessories</p>

<p>Nothing to build today, just your usual baggie of forks, knifes and plates plus cooking pans and mixing bowls and stuff. Ordinarily I&rsquo;d say this is a very weak door to open, but it serves a greater purpose because it gives you the necessary tools for filling the table with places for the mini-dolls to sit and eat. It still might disappoint some because there&rsquo;s nothing to build.</p>

<p>Day 11: Kitchen Stove</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t cook dinner without a stove, and this little model is really impressive. It&rsquo;s similar to other stoves we&rsquo;ve seen in sets like Stephanie&rsquo;s Outdoor Bakery, but it is another nice addition to build up the scene of preparing Christmas Dinner.</p>

<p>Day 12: Pot &amp; Tomato Soup (Cranberry Sauce)</p>

<p>Something small to put on the stove and fill the plates with, some claim this is tomato soup, personally I think it might also be homemade cranberry sauce, either way there are very few parts behind this door, but it does build onto the scene that most of these doors have been aiming for.</p>

<p>Day 13: Kitchen Drawers</p>

<p>This is a cute little microbuild, not only do you have somewhere to put some of the utensils now, but you also get a pair of salt &amp; pepper shakers and a small wedge of cheese under glass. I think this model is a nice addition to the kitchen stove from day 11, and it&rsquo;s very fun, the inclusion of a dome with cheese is a nice touch. Especially since it uses the cheese wedge piece for an actual piece of cheese.</p>

<p>Day 14: Food</p>

<p>More delicious accessories for the dinner, here you have two carrots, two chicken legs, two glasses of wine, or sparkling juice, and two little icing covered cookies. Or what I&rsquo;m assuming are icing covered cookies. It would have been nice to get the actual turkey piece that those legs go on with this set, unfortunately that piece might have cost us some of the other pieces for this day.</p>

<p>Day 15: Kitchen Sink</p>

<p>More building today, it&rsquo;s a nice model too, with a tap and soap dispenser for cleaning the dishes once the meal is complete. Not a bad model, and it fills in the kitchen for the mini-dolls quite nicely.</p>

<p>Day 16: Cookie Jar &amp; Mugs</p>

<p>Two pink coffee mugs, for hot chocolate, and a little dome with a star shaped cookie, must be a cookie jar. This won&rsquo;t fit on the table with everything else already on it, but that&rsquo;s ok. It&rsquo;s not terrible, however it isn&rsquo;t the best offering from behind the doors here.</p>

<p>Day 17: Fireplace</p>

<p>After dinner you always want to sit beside a cozy fireplace and enjoy the company of family and friends. This isn&rsquo;t a bad offering, it&rsquo;s a fun little model and looks very cozy for the mini-dolls to sit by. The method for having a roaring fire inside is a clever use of parts.</p>

<p>Day 18: Side Table with Book</p>

<p>With a little side table to go near the fireplace and a good book to read your mini-dolls will have lots of fun. Right now they&rsquo;re probably still using the chairs from the table, but soon we&rsquo;ll have somewhere better for them to sit. The inclusion of a cute little reading lamp really makes this day a decent offering.</p>

<p>Day 19: Couch</p>

<p>Here it is, the couch is a nice purple with pink cushions to sit on, or something like that. The tiles being pink make for a nice contrast, but an odd one with the purple, I think a dark red would have made for a more interesting looking model. You might be able to fit both mini-dolls on it, but they won&rsquo;t stay very well. Still it&rsquo;s a nice model to find behind the door compared to what&rsquo;s next.</p>

<p>Day 20: Cat</p>

<p>3 pieces behind this door, I think this is the least amount of parts. And while I admit the cat is a nice piece to have, the fact that you only stick two plates together for a small square pillow for her to sit on is just&hellip; How is this a good present? Ok, I will admit playing with the cat and the mini-dolls is probably the big draw for younger builders, however there might be a lot more disappointment here.</p>

<p>Day 21: Speaker &amp; Ipod</p>

<p>This makes up for the previous door, just barely, the small speaker and the ipod docking station allows the mini-dolls to listen to some festive music while sitting on the couch. The speaker is a great little build, and while the docking station is just one sloped piece with a printed tile on it, it is still very fun.</p>

<p>Day 22: Small Present</p>

<p>This is a much better present than last time, you get to build an actual box that you can put small accessories in, case in point there&rsquo;s a ribbon included. Possibly for the cat, but you can give it to either mini-doll.</p>

<p>Day 23: Christmas Tree</p>

<p>Why is this on the second to last day? Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, it&rsquo;s a very nice model with a heart jewel topper and pink studs for the lights, but it should have been the crowning conclusion to the calendar, not on the day before Christmas Eve. It just doesn&rsquo;t make sense for it to be here. The model is very nice though, I&rsquo;ve built only a couple of trees for the holidays, and this one is one of the better offerings.</p>

<p>Day 24: Large Present &amp; Camera</p>

<p>This is at least a nice model, but really it should have been yesterday, with the tree for today. The present is a large rectangular model that houses two pairs of skates. With the small pond of ice on the inner flap of the box&rsquo;s art this means Mia and Ewa can enjoy some skating. The camera is either another present or for taking pictures of opening presents. Either way it&rsquo;s a nice little pair of gifts for the last day. And they can fit under the tree no problem.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Compared to 2013 I think this Calendar has a slightly more cohesive storyline behind it. Mia and Ewa enjoy a good home cooked meal and then spend some time enjoying hot cocoa before ending the holidays with some decent presents for both of them. The packaging is also really impressive.</p>

<p>Seeing as how 2015 looks to include only two mini-dolls again this year it appears we&rsquo;ll have to wait and see what the contents will be. Do I recommend this one? Well if you can find one still sealed for a good price it does include some nice mini-dolls and a lot of useful holiday models. Get it if you can.</p>
