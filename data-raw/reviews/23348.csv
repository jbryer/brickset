These are the sets I needed as a child, being animal-mad, and on graduating from my beloved moulded Duplo animals&hellip; Well, the rather dodgy brick-built creatures that I fumbled together just didn&rsquo;t do it for me &ndash; instant dark age.</p>

<p>There have been some great mini-scenes (salmon-leaping rapids) and increasingly exotic animals (tiger, penguin, orang-utan etc.) in the range, all perfect additions for any MOC Zoo. Series Six brings home the &#39;Seal&#39;, Lion and Panda; the latter two already seen in the Friends Jungle sub-theme sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Seal&hellip; </strong>is not, in actual fact, a seal. When this was initially announced, I imagined a white seal to live alongside the penguin exhibit. On spotting the promo pictures, I couldn&rsquo;t help the frown: it&rsquo;s not actually a seal. This little chap is a sea lion. Seals are NOT able to rotate their tail about as this little fellow is posed, this is a sea lion trait. Our seal(ion) also comes with a little orange ball to boot, and a seesaw (sea lion show, anyone?)</p>

<p>This said, he&rsquo;s a stunning rendition of a sea lion and a wonderful new character for the animal line &ndash; sat very proud and regal! Although of the Friends-scale, he doesn&rsquo;t look outlandishly over-sized (like the &lsquo;mega&rsquo; deer of S3 did) compared to the traditional minifigure and teams lovely with the various wet-suit minifigures for a seal(ion) show.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Mini-Scene</strong>, the &lsquo;rock&rsquo; and alternative-build &lsquo;den&rsquo;, is a tad underwhelming compared to the creative array from the previous two runs, although there is a nice selection for just 37 bricks (looking at you, apple-white slopes). Part of the appeal for me has always been to quick build alternative scenes - with admittedly mixed results - but this is great for the less experienced builder to break into Lego with its small yet versatile brick count (as the theme is realistically intended).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Over-all</strong>, a lovely <strong>SEA LION</strong>, and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d be purchasing it for. There are a few nice bits and pieces, including an extra fish to flesh out aquarium dioramas, but the scene (and alternative build) itself is a little lacklustre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grab a couple of these deliciously affordable packets mind and you can create yourself something far more appealing; I&rsquo;ve dispensed with that horrible see-saw and re-jigged to construct some jolly purple bleachers for the audience. Besides, what self-respecting MOC Zoo can be without sea lions now they&rsquo;re official available?</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-31T22:59:21.4Z","Awesome Seal, Fun Little Build.","<p><strong>Set #41047 Seal&rsquo;s Little Rock: </strong>In Series 6 we get another great new animal sculpt for our collections in the form of a seal. This set also has a load of impressive colour choices with the pieces. Let us discuss pros and cons and we&rsquo;ll cover the overall thoughts on the set at the end.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Loads of great colours in this set, lavender and light blue, two aquamarine sloped bricks and a bright orange technic piece used for a ball for the seal.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Animal sculpt for a seal introduced with this set, great looking sculpt though slightly hindered by how it attaches with only one stud connector.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Habitat build is a very fun looking little build, with a see-saw model for the seal to play on, great use of parts all around in this build.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fish included to feed the seal, and orange ball for more play fun.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Piece count kind of small.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ball cannot be balanced on the seal&rsquo;s nose, as you might like to do while playing with this set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Placement of bow is just ridiculous, certain animals would not wear bows on their heads and in this case the animal in question just wouldn&rsquo;t be able to wear a bow. Really frustrating play feature included with all the animal sculpts.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say the parts is the big draw for this set. Recommended more for parts than the official build, also recommended for the seal animal as the animal piece is brand new and helps build up your zoo of animals from LEGO.</p>
