Is this set worthy of picking up? You&rsquo;ll find out after the pros and cons of the set in my conclusion for the set.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Cat cub piece used again.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Habitat build is interesting for its limited use of parts, lacks anything too unique for colours unfortunately; however is still a fun little build and would look great as part of the LEGO Heartlake Zoo build these 2014 Animal sets have been aiming towards.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Awesome looking miniature tree build in this set.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Habitat build does not include any real play features for the set. It&rsquo;s more of a display piece honestly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Bows and animals just do not work well, LEGO should have tried out a different idea for these animal sculpts.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I would recommend this set to complete the collection really. The build is actually a great display piece as well and would fit in quite well for a zoo display, like most of the 2014 LEGO Friends animals sets. The way the little tree is built is quite clever too to give it that slanted look. I enjoy all of the great Animal pieces that LEGO has introduced as well.</p>
