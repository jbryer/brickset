The dragon is what we bought this set for, but the other parts are also very great! The knights have great looks on there faces, but it makes me think if this is for kids!

Pros;
What else, The DRAGON.
The big building plate is also very good for building.
Trap doors, two of them, kids love them (and so do I)

Cons; 
The shields on the box have stickers on them, but the real ones do not. Very disapointing!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
