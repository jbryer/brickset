Why? Well we&rsquo;ll discuss that in the bulk of the review, but suffice it to say the primary model in this set doesn&rsquo;t really do it for me. On to the pro cons section of the review.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>New Panda animal sculpt, different from the new bear sculpt for animal pieces we got in Series 5. Cute little piece that&hellip; can be an animal or a stuffed teddy I suppose.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Main model is quick to build and ready for play in moments. Nice use of pieces also, especially to make the bamboo.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Generic looking model. It&rsquo;s pretty much a small climbing structure for the panda, and across it lays what I&rsquo;m assuming is a log for crossing one area to get to the slide. The bamboo is the leafy stick clipped to the back.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Animal sculpt looks a bit off compared to other animal sculpts, it seriously looks like an overgrown stuffed bear, especially with the bow on it and looks the least useful for building a LEGO zoo.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the main model in this set. It might work for that zoo I keep mentioning as a panda habitat. I just find it a bit too generic looking for my tastes, I think it could have used a bit better design. I just don&rsquo;t know why most of these animal habitats/homes need to include slides all the time. And all the jumper plates detract a little from the symmetry of the set. What this means is I would mostly recommend this for the fans only, other AFOLs, TFOLs and KFOLs might prefer to stick with other sets for unique parts. Since this set really doesn&rsquo;t have any to speak of.</p>
