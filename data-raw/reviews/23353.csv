I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider&quot;- Bilbo Baggins to Smaug.</p>

<p>As there are no reviews currently&nbsp;up on Brickset for this set, I thought I&#39;d take on the task of writing a review of this highly detailed set, which happens to be&nbsp;the largest of sets&nbsp;from&nbsp;the Battle of Five Armies wave of The Hobbit Lego sets, The Lonely Mountain. This set depicts scenes from the upcoming&nbsp;The&nbsp;Battle of Five Armies as well as scenes from the previous film, The Desolation of Smaug. This set retails for $129.99 in the US, comes with 866 pieces, and was publicly available for purchase&nbsp;October 15th, 2014.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has The Battle of Five Armies logo&nbsp;for this set since this is a product from that wave. It has a dark green box art to go along with the logo that looks to be depicting a possible scene from the battle of five armies in the city of Dale above the picture of the actual set. The back of the box shows the functions and features of the set, which actually turns out to be quite a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions in this set are great. It comes as a single&nbsp;instruction manual and surprisingly&nbsp;is a different quality than most. where as most have curved edges where the pages are stapled&nbsp;together this one has a flat side&nbsp;with the pages glued on&nbsp;perpendicular to the side to give it a more book-like feel to it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I must say this set is full of lovely sand green and gold parts, and plenty of them. It also includes some trans dark green&nbsp;blades for Dwalins axe and a nice printed tile to go on top of the Lego&nbsp;Legends of Chima Chi piece to make the Arkenstone (you get an extra of each piece too which is nice for MOCs). Almost all of Smaug is made of new molds, excluding the flame protruding from his mouth, his claws and the&nbsp;joints that connect them to&nbsp;his wings, and the front two thirds of his tail. His head, jaw, neck, torso, and wings are all new. I&#39;m not sure if his feet or tip of his tail have been used on a castle dragon before, but I&nbsp;believe they are new. The feet are a dark red with side printing of his dragon skin, and the claws appear to be molded out of black and not painted on above the red. His torso&nbsp;and head also have printing on them with golden scales (and even a loosened scale from a particular black arrow) on his torso and eyes on his head. Hear is a photo of him above&nbsp;Lake town.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Five minifigures and Smaug&nbsp;the dragon are included in this set. Before&nbsp;I&nbsp;start I&#39;d like to mention all the figures have faces previously used on other versions of themselves.&nbsp;First we have Bilbo, sporting a blue coat,&nbsp;given to him by Thorin&nbsp;(if I am not mistaken). He is equipped with his blade Sting and the one ring, and is wearing dark brown pants. Next we have&nbsp;the dwarves, who all appear to be armored iterations of themselves for the upcoming battle.&nbsp;Each outfit looks like it was found somewhere in Erebor, since there a lots of gem shaped patterns on their torsos. They&nbsp;all have dark silver arms except Balin, who has a standard silver for his arms and a red torso with silver and bronze printing on it. Balin and his Brother, Dwalin, both carry weapons matching the color of their armor. Dwalin&nbsp;sport a dark green outfit, with gold, brown,&nbsp;and dark green printed&nbsp;torso. He has tattoo printing that wraps around his head just as his figure from An Unexpected Gathering had. Next we have Fili, who has a dark blue outfit with gold, silver, and brown printing on his torso. Last but certainly not least is the younger brother of Fili, Kili. Kili has a black torso with gold, silver, and brown printing and is wearing dark grey pants. Both are equipped with short swords, Fili with two silver and Kili with one dark silver&nbsp;(or metallic).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The builds was very enjoyable. Nothing to over&nbsp;complicated&nbsp;and quite simple in some places (such as the pillars on each side of the throne).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Since the build is composed of a few different sections I will be spitting up this sections to get as far into discussing the detail as I can. First up we have the Throne room. The centerpiece of the throne room is of course the throne. The throne is built using many SNOT (studs not on top) techniques to give it the tall and slender look it has in the film. There are stickers applied to the front side of the backrest on the throne and above it there is another sticker with some gem patterns designed by dwarves. Leading up to the throne is&nbsp;a flight of stairs. at the base are some gold plates to depict the gold and gems scattered across the floor and on the back side there is a pin where if you tap it lightly the top four rows of stairs fly off the front(as one piece), reveling a couple gold ingots below the throne. The pillars that go up to give this section structure&nbsp;are marvelous, and are&nbsp;made mostly out of basic 2 by 4 bricks which help give them a sense of thickness.</p>

<p>Moving on to the mine section of this set I&nbsp;wil begin with the bottom right corner. this section has &nbsp;a small attachment thanks to a couple technic pieces that is suppose to be liquid gold flowing down a ramp. Just to the left is the hidden entrance to Erebor. On either side of this opening brick&nbsp;built&nbsp;stone&nbsp;door there is a spot to connect a key to, thus giving the impression that the dwarves have found the hidden keyhole in the secret mountainside entrance. Before I move back onto the front side of this section it is worth mentioning there is a small section&nbsp;to&nbsp;the right (behind the dwarves forging area) made of trans blue and orange that you can place the Arkenstone in, recreating a scene at the very beginning of An Unexpected&nbsp;Journey where a mining dwarf (who I believe to be Dwalin actually, but it could be a similar looking dwarf) found the Arkenstone. Returning to the front side of the set we have the forging area for the blacksmiths to use. There is a rack to hold some armor on the right just beside the hidden entrance. We also have an area to hold some crafting tools and an anvil sitting at the front of the ground level work area. On the far left is a ladder that leads up to the second flight of the mine. On the left is what looks to be a furnace (possibly representing&nbsp;the ones Smaug lit in the second film maybe?) that has a catapult&nbsp;function to it. It is very different and not something I&nbsp;was expecting from the set but it definitely adds some playability since Lego was unable to produce a golden statue to use against Smaug. Moving to the right we have a large rock piece with a ladder leading to a small third flight. This section appears to be an area where the dwarves can mine gold. At the base of the ladder there is a barrel holding a pickaxe for the workers to use. On the very right we have a fortress wall. This area looks very similar to the balcony at the front entrance of the Lonely Mountain which appeared briefly in the first film and I&nbsp;believe with also appear in the final when Thorin&nbsp;and Bard talk just before the escalation that leads to the battle of five armies. Oddly enough I did not see any of these sections on the interior of the mountain but it is completely possible they were. At the top of this section there is a moving winch with a bucket full of gold attached to it. You can move it right or left, and there is the option to stop it right above the furnace,giving the playability factor&nbsp;of dumping the bucket into the furnace/catapult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final build in this set is a small pile of gold and jewels. You can easily place the Arkenstone&nbsp;at the top of the pile in between some wedged gold pieces and a grail. You also have to option to lift up a middle section inside the pile, which appears to be some sort of crate full of gems. below the box there is some more storage space for a sword and another goblet (this time in green).</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Many fans&nbsp;have complained that there should have been one more large section to this set, but after building this set I have noticed that it would have be hard to fit Smaug&nbsp;inside the set for playability, but by leaving an open side there is plenty of space for him to moving across the mine. While I am not&nbsp;positive of how much Smaug would individually be worth I am not sure that his inclusion justifies the price of this set. I could see this retailing for $120, but $10 isn&#39;t to much more, so it isn&#39;t a huge concern to me since the quality of this set is spectacular. I would probably argue that this is the second best Hobbit set besides An Unexpected Gathering mostly because it is a great build, with great figures, great accessories, great playability, and includes one of the best Lego dragons since the green 1990&#39;s&nbsp;fantasy dragons&nbsp;included in the&nbsp;early knights related themes if not the best. For a Hobbit fan this set is a beautiful addition to a wonderfully designed theme and a must get. For Lego&nbsp;fans looking for great parts or just looking for a fun build&nbsp;this is definitely worth considering purchase, especially since discounts at Amazon are offering it&nbsp;at great price. If your reading this after the product has been discontinued and are considering purchasing it for a higher aftermarket&nbsp;price I would say this set is a good investment because of all of the factors it has to offer from exclusive molds to a great overall design. As a huge fan of&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;and The Hobbit, it is great to finally get a set of the Lonely mountain, with the inclusion of&nbsp;Smaug&nbsp;no less!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I hoped you enjoyed the review!</p>

"Thebrickdoctor","2015-04-02T08:13:56.117Z","A great final set for the Middle Earth line","<p><em>Far over the misty mountains cold,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To dungeons deep and caverns old,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We must away ere break of day,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To seek the pale enchanted gold.</em></p>

<p>These are the first lines of the song that the dwarves sing to Bilbo about the misty mountains and about the dwarves rise and fall in the Hobbit. These are the words that captivated Bilbo and I also. Before I go on any further I must confess,&nbsp;(if I have not already made it clear :D) that I am a diehard Hobbit fan (book, not so much the movie). The Lonely Mountain set is based on the scene from the Desolation of Smaug when the dwarves take on the dragon in attempt to destroy him. This is probably the last Middle Earth set I will build, and as such I had high expectations. The set, in Australia was extremely hard to find and so I resorted to the LEGO website to buy it. However, is the cost of $190 AUD justified?</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is a large box, as expected for a large set. It shows off different aspects of the set as well as the weapons and Smaug. The instructions are contained in one thickly bound manual which is good to see. I think this is a first for at least the Hobbit/LOTR sets which usually include more than one numbered manual. The manual was not bent or torn which is good. It was easy to follow with no mistakes that I can recall.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set contains 866 pieces contained in six numbered bags and five smaller bags containing the parts for Smaug. As you would expect from the picture, there are a lot of sand green and gold elements. Indeed there are 97 gold pieces which make up a good&nbsp;ninth&nbsp;of the sets piece count. There are another 162 sand green pieces which make up another chunk of the sets pieces. There are of course the new moulded pieces for Smaug. Unlike many people, I am fine with the moulded pieces that make Smaug. There are five stickers included in this set which are of the clear type which do not peel. Overall there is a fantastic piece selection for those wanting sand green and gold elements.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>As would be expected from a licensed set, the minifigures are a big draw. The set contains Bilbo, five of the dwarves and of course Smaug. All minifigures in this set are new variants or for Smaug, a completely new character. Bilbo Baggins is the main protagonist of the Hobbit who has been whisked away from his comfortable Hobbit hole. He wears a blue coat which is featured in the Desolation of Smaug and Battle of the Five Armies movies. He has a double sided head and is simple, but good. Balin, the eldest dwarve on the quest is equipped with a red and black brick built mace which looks great. He wears a new red armoured costume which looks just like in the movies. Dwalin, the brother of Balin wears a green costume and is armed with a gold and green axe. Although he does look quite nice, Dwalin never actually wears a green cloak or wield a green and gold axe. The twin brothers Fili and Kili are also two simple but interesting minifigures. They are equipped with swords and double sided heads. Now for the star of the set: Smaug. Although he is not really a minifigure at all, but a giant moulded dragon, he is great. At first, I was sceptical of Smaug, as the original pictures did not show how poseable the dragon is, however that changed when I had it in my hands. He features fantastic printing on his belly, including the one spot where he is shot, as well as ball joints for his wings. The wings are made of a sort of rubbery flexible material that can be opened and closed which is a very good feature. Overall the minifigure selection here is great for any Middle Earth collection.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>I built this in separate sittings but it took about three hours at a leisurely pace. The set is not particularly hard to build but does have a few SNOT techniques, although nothing too difficult. It is an easy build, but it is also a fun one. Bag one is used to make Smaug and a small gold&nbsp;rocky part&nbsp;containing jewels. Bag two to four build the major mine part of the set which contains the secret door into the mountain. The last bags, five and six contain the parts to build the throne room.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Ok, I&#39;ll just say it; the completed build looks fantastic (IMHO). The small gold mound built in the first bag contains two gems and a trans green goblet. The mine looks great with the rock and wood merged together nicely. The set includes a catapult, which does not feature in the movie, but adds some playability to the set. There is a small armoury with an anvil, a helmet and some weapons which looks great. There is also a thing that slides across the top of the mine (I&rsquo;m not exactly sure what to call it) which can be lowered and raised and carry treasure or even a minifigure. Next to the armoury is the secret door, where Bilbo sneaks into mountain to steal a goblet in the book. Turning the model around, the Arkenstone is revealed which lies on top of a pile of blue and orange plates. In between the throne and the mine is a golden river which Thorin rides a wheelbarrow on in the Desolation of Smaug. The throne has a nifty play feature that allows the stairs to shoot forward when a lever is pushed at the back. This reveals some gold at the base of the throne. The throne itself uses some SNOT techniques and is decorated with two stickers. The entire set is decorated with gold slopes which gives it a very royal look. The only thing this set lacks are, well coins. In the book and the movies, Smaug lies in a pile of gold coins. It would be a bit ridiculous to expect hundreds of gold coins to completely cover Smaug but several would have been great. Some more gems would have also have been appreciated. Overall despite these minor nit-picks the set looks great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am extremely pleased with this set and how it turned out. It surpassed my original expectations and has plenty of useful parts. Although this set is great with fantastic parts, figures and a great build, I don&#39;t think it should have cost what it did. For AUD$190 I would expect a lot more pieces. The price per piece ratio is very high, even for a licensed set at about 20 cents apiece. This really should have come with some of the other dwarves, like Thror or Thrain to even be slightly justified. Despite the price, this set is a great addition to any Middle Earth collection or just for anyone who wants a great set.</p>

<br />
By looking at this line, I think it is clear that I have Smaug the stupendous in this amazing set. He appeared in the movie The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug in 2013. I bought it in Hong Kong while I was traveling with my wife for honeymoon. Lets get started.<br />
<br />
<b>Overview</b><br />
<br />
Name: The Lonely Mountain.<br />
Theme: The Hobbit<br />
Year: 2014<br />
Pieces: 866 pieces<br />
Minifigures: 5 and a dragon<br />
Price: &pound;99.99 / $129.99 / 129.99&euro;<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Introduction</b><br />
Durin&#39;s day is ending and they still can&#39;t find the keyhole of the secret door. But Bilbo isn&#39;t giving up hope after the sun went down. Knocking and gnawing at the grey stone wall while the dwarves leave the mountain, he finally found the key hole when the moon light shines onto the door. The &#39;last light&#39; meant the moon light! He yells at the company and Thorin picked up the key left to him by his father Thrain, opens up the secret door and found this treasure in it, 79018.<br />
<br />
<b>The Box</b><br />
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/79875989@N03/34078987320/in/dateposted-public/""><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4173/34078987320_15f84be068_b.jpg"" /></a><br />
<br />
As usual the box art is amazing. The dark green background is very nicely matched with this sand green LEGO set. At the front of the box you can see the battle between the dwarves and Smaug is going on and quite a lot of gold is used in this set. At the back, the dwarves are busy preparing while Smaug sneaks around to find them. Lots of play features in this set and the minifgures are very nice showing at the side of the box.<br />
<br />
<b>The Instruction</b><br />

<br />
This book is thick, with hard binding at the side. There is love and hate to this kind of booklet. The love is there is only one book to keep and the hate of course is that it is hard to stay in place when you are building unless you really fold it at the page turner which is quite damaging to the bindings. In the list, you can only find six dwarves in the whole series unlike the thirteen ones at the previous sets. Maybe the other dwarves were less seen in the movie.<br />

<br />
In this set, you get five exclusive minifigures and one exclusive Dragon, The Smaug. Before this set was launched, we all thought that LEGO would be lazy enough to use the old castle dragon as Smaug but it turns out that this new mold of dragon is very awesome! In this picture, the head sculpture of Smaug captured all the details very accurately. &#39;My teeth are sword&#39; and the burning eyes are nicely carved out. These four dwarves and Bilbo gets new armors and new weapons. Dwalin is holding a pearl gold axe with trans green axe, Kili with a &#39;Morgul Blade&#39;, Fili gets back his old double sword and Balin has his dark red club. I suppose the Lonely Mountain really housed loads of treasure for them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<br />
All of them has alternate face except Dwalin as he is bald. All the dwarves are angry, Bilbo is truly scared of meeting Smaug.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/79875989@N03/34422517966/in/dateposted-public/""><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4158/34422517966_4d44f70f85_b.jpg"" /></a><br />
<br />
Under the beard. Both of them have nicely printed torso under their bulky beard. The belts are amazingly designed and you can see wrinkles and battle damaged faces of Balin and Dwalin. The arms are also using very nice metalic color to assimilate the armor they are wearing.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/79875989@N03/34333461821/in/dateposted-public/""><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4180/34333461821_d7030cb497_b.jpg"" /></a><br />
<br />
The comparison between casual wear dwarves and working attired dwarves. Same as Bilbo with three different outfit. The designs are totally different and all of them are from different sets. By looking at them you can appreciate the financial condition of them before and after claiming Erebor. Again, Santa is here and he is very different from Balin.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Now you can see the full picture of this ferocious beast. The wings are made of silicone (I think) to make the flaps fold. It has two legs with the claws at the wings as his hands just like the movie. I think this is the largest dragon LEGO has ever produced. He stood up to 24 cm tall, 47.5 cm long and 42.5 cm wide. You can see when the wings are closed, he still can stand properly and the claws can be bent to make him more stable on the floor. The body part printing is so detailed that you can see what Girion did back in the years with his black arrow.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/79875989@N03/33654084713/in/dateposted-public/""><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4175/33654084713_f0836e1512_b.jpg"" /></a><br />
<br />
The wings are attached to his body with a three holed ball joint. This makes him very widely pose-able. You can turn the wings 180 degree each side. He cannot be ride as there are no seat given at the back of the spiky body. However please be careful as the center black spike on a jumper is quite loose and you might lost it. The tail is also exclusive to him and its quite long if you look at it sideway.<br />
<br />

<br />
Lets have some dental check up for this yellow teeth fella. There are a few degree of mouth opening for him and if you look at the picture you can imagine Benedict Cumberbatch&#39;s voice talking. All of them represents different expressions I think. First degree- talking, Second degree- yelling, and when the fire attached, you know what he means. haha. Look into the throat, you can see a stud hole for fire attachment which is much nicer compare to old dragons.<br />
<br />
<a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/79875989@N03/34333488671/in/dateposted-public/""><img src=""https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4192/34333488671_dfab754c2f_b.jpg"" /></a><br />
<br />
For comparison, you can see Smaug is much more larger in size compare to the dragon from the castle set 70403. Old dragon has two hands, with a pair of stiff and smaller wings. Tail design is different too and I think Smaug is much more superior than this old dragon of LEGO.<br />

The gold &#39;mountain&#39;. This is a three layered build which you can store treasures inside. At the bottom layer, you get a pearl black long sword and a trans green goblet which is very nice, and second layer with three different colored gems. The lid with gold cup makes the third layer. I liked all these gold pieces stacking around each other.<br />

Thorin&#39;s chair was decorated with stickers and a trans clear printed round tile representing the Arkenstone. As comparison, Theoden looks much poorer with a small throne. haha.<br />

The second build is the chain pulley pulling a bucket. It was attached loosely to the railway so that it can slide along it. Lots of technic pieces in this build and I like the chain. The brown knob is to turn the wheel and raise or release the bucket of gold.&nbsp;<br />

This build is a furnace filled with dome shaped gold and a long pole to be attached into the pin hole. Its a quite large furnace designed to launch piles of molten gold to attack the dragon. As you can see, the furnace can be turned 360 degree to aim.<br />

After a few hours of building, this is the full build of The Lonely Mountain. The use of sand green pieces are very nice matched with some grey and brown. This dwarvish mine is very nicely designed and its large enough for Smaug to play around and smacking the pillars. Quite some annoying stickers to be applied but with Smaug and Arkenstone I don&#39;t complain much.<br />

One more play feature at the front of the build. Stay tuned, the back is also interesting!<br />

The black round knob is to push the ladder under the throne. The secret door with a key hole, and a pile of gems with the Arkenstone on top of it. If you notice, on top of the Arkenstone there is a BURP piece to make the bulk of the stone at the front.&nbsp;<br />

<b>Conclusion</b><br />
The Smaug made up the whole value to this set. I bought this because of the dragon and others are a bonus to the set. Smaug is very pose able but need great skill to take good shot of him. Most of the angle makes him look ugly. The build is adequate to the size of the dragon and of course you can buy a few more sets to enlarge it. The minifigures are all exclusive to the set and makes this set much more worthy to get.<br />
<br />
<b>Review Summary</b><br />
Playability: 9/10 - The mechanisms are great to be play with like the actions in the movie while they are fighting the dragon!<br />
Design / Building Experience: 9/10 - The GOLD pieces and the sand green pillars are so nicely used in the set instead of all grey like in the movie.<br />
Minifigures: 9/10 - Great minifigures! All the printings and the details exceeds all expectations.<br />
Price / Value for money: 9/10 - I think the value of the money spent for this set goes to the Serpent from the North.&nbsp;<br />
Overall: 9/10 - I bought it in 2014, and after three years, I still bring out Smaug and play with him.&nbsp;<br />

"Shib","2015-05-20T10:54:16.54Z","The Green, the Gold and the Dragon","<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Erebor, the Lonely Mountain - one of Tolkien&rsquo;s best known locations was almost certain to show up in LEGO when the Hobbit theme was first announced, but it&rsquo;s been a long time coming, and Peter Jackson&rsquo;s take on Erebor wasn&#39;t to everyone&rsquo;s taste. Is this set the jewel it should be? (Fair warning if you haven&rsquo;t seen the Hobbit Trilogy, this review contains spoilers!)</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;""><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">I have to be honest I was genuinely surprised by just how big the box is on this set. As with most LEGO sets there is a lot of empty space in the box, so it could have been a lot smaller and still fit everything in, but I can understand the need for a large box on a shop shelf to imply good value for that steep &pound;99.99 ($129.99) RRP. The green Battle of the Five Armies branding is very obvious and very fitting for the subtheme, but the scene shown on the box is actually closer to events in The Desolation of Smaug.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">The photos on the box do show a lot of action and gives a bit of a taste of some of the play features, however they also make the set look a little small to me, especially when comparing it to the finished model.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">I think it&rsquo;s worth note that the pose Smaug is in on the box which takes up a lot of space, and the fact that he is positioned almost dead centre of the picture really shows that Smaug is the big selling point for this set - it was the main reason I wanted it.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">The instructions are in a single book, bound with a typical paperback glued spine approach, I know that not everyone likes this approach (particularly after the Ghostbusters instructions being poorly glued in the first run) but I actually really like it. I had no problems with pages coming loose of the book closing on itself, I personally see this type of binding as something that can nicely be stacked on a shelf and not look scruffy like the smaller stapled books. As ever the instructions were simple to follow, I think there was only one step where I had to take a second look at the instructions as the parts behind what was being added were the same and made it a little unclear - not enough to cause a mistake though.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">When pictures of this set first emerged my eyes lit up at the sight of so much sand green - the sand and earth colours are generally my favourite that LEGO produce. What I found really good with the sand green parts is just how many of them are basic bricks, plenty of 2x2s, 2x4s and 1x2s - meaning lots of useful building parts in a hard to find colour. I know that a lot of Harry Potter fans still lust after more sand green parts for Hogwarts extensions, so I can certainly see this set appealing to them. As well as the basic bricks there are some <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6083973"">good corner roofing parts in sand green</a> that appear to be unique to this set.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">As you&rsquo;d expect from a set based on a treasure hoard there is also a fair amount of gold parts. Don&rsquo;t expect a full on treasure hoard though - most of the gold is in the form of cheese slopes and the &lsquo;rock crystal&rsquo; parts. The inclusion of six <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6019252"">2X2X2/65 Degree Roof Tiles </a>does make up for this a little. I&rsquo;d have loved for some of the gold to be chromed gold but I accept that the chrome finish does often wear off so from a long term frame of mind the choice LEGO made it probably for the best.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">That steep price does make the set a little bit hard to justify this as a parts pack, however as all the minifigures and Smaug are unique to this set I suspect you could sell them separately and come out ahead on keeping the parts.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">The one unique part I was a little disappointed with was the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6091590"">Arkenstone</a>. This have been done with a flat 1x1 round printed with a gem design then attached to a Legends of Chima blue Chi piece. I&rsquo;d have preferred just the flat 1x1 but with more of a swirling colour on the print - I suspect it might have been done to look like a generic gem so the print can be reused in future.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;""><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Minifigures</span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">The figures included represent both a high and low in this set to my mind. Firstly, I have to address the choice of characters - it wasn&rsquo;t until I was building the set that it occurred to me that Fili and Kili were not at the Lonely Mountain during the fight with Smaug. Considering the amount of other Dwarves who were there that could have been included instead this seems a bit of an irritating choice. All of the minifigures included are characters that have featured in other sets, but they are all variants unique to this set.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; min-height: 19px;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Bilbo - It would have been ridiculous to do a lonely mountain set without Bilbo. This version is in the blue jacket seen in the film and does come across to me as a fair representation of the film - while I might have preferred this as a last chance for a transparent ring wearing Bilbo, I was not for a minute actually expecting to get one.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; min-height: 19px;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Balin - I was glad to see Balin included in this set, those that have seen the Desolation of Smaug will know that Balin plays quite an important part in the fight against the dragon. The red armour he&rsquo;s wearing is clearly inspired by but not completely accurate, but I think it actually adds a bit more character to the minifigure. Unfortunately most of the torso print is covered by beard, but what is visible on the print looks suitably dwarfish.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; min-height: 19px;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Dwalin - As one of the strongest warriors of the Company of Thorin, Dwalin also makes a lot of sense in the set. Like Balin, the colour of his armour is more from artistic licence, and I wasn&rsquo;t keen on it initially, until I put him against some of the brown sections of the set and the colour choice started to look really good. The print on the torso&nbsp; does have a certain battle ready look, but isn&rsquo;t very armoured.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; min-height: 19px;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Kili - Kili&rsquo;s torso is probably the best of the figures included for looking like armour - being grey and silver gives a distinct advantage, but also the print is well designed to look like armour plates.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; min-height: 19px;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Fili - I really like the colour of Fili&rsquo;s torso and legs, while dark blue doesn&rsquo;t instantly spring to mind as a colour for armour the chain mail print at the top of the torso sells it very well.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial; min-height: 19px;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Smaug - Ok so Smaug isn&rsquo;t technically a minifigure, but given that he is included on the character list on the front of the box with the other minifigures and he is one of the biggest selling points of the set I felt it only fair to count him as if he was a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">It&rsquo;s fairly obvious that a lot of the production cost of the set will have been making Smaug - almost every part used to make him is new and unique to him, and those that aren&rsquo;t are a new colour of the part. The wings in particular are odd for LEGO elements in that they are a mix of rubbery plastic and more typical hard plastic - although rubbery parts are not new, and always a little bit of a concern amongst collectors I think that they work well for Smaug&rsquo;s wings. The head mould is also quite satisfying in comparison to the source material - and the point to attach a flame to is actually inside the mouth, not on the lips of the lower jaw as was the case with the dragon from <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70403-1/Dragon-Mountain"">70403: Dragon Mountain</a>. I also feel the need to point out that Smaug really is big, I know some people were disappointed he wasn&rsquo;t bigger to be at a better scale with the minifigures but I honestly can&rsquo;t imagine him being any larger than LEGO have made him here.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">While I would have preferred a more traditional design for Smaug, how he appears in Tolkien&rsquo;s original illustrations, I accept that the licensing is for the films and on that front this dragon works very well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">The build is done in what is becoming more the norm for this type of set, several modules that can de joined in several different ways by technic pins. I think it&rsquo;s a good standard for LEGO to stick with as it adds an extra layer to the construction possibilities.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Be prepared for a lot of standard brick stacking sections of the build - for the most part I didn&rsquo;t find it boring, but neither did it feel like much of a challenge at any point either.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">That said, some of the play feature elements were quite fun to build. The hidden passage is quite nice when you see it come together, but the real gem in building terms is the sliding winch at the top of the set. While it&rsquo;s nothing ground breaking the change from standard stacking to building something a little more engineered in the very middle of the build was a clever choice.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""margin: 0px; font-family: Helvetica; -webkit-text-stroke-color: rgb(68, 68, 68); -webkit-text-stroke-width: initial;"">Here we come to the biggest issue with this set - The completed model definitely looks like the source material - the sand green is probably the best colour choice on the LEGO palette and features like the stream of molten gold, mining equipment and throne all sell it well. However the film&rsquo;s interpretation of the location is not massively memorable - I think that people will likely remember the giant Dwarf statues at the main entrance better than the throne room/furnaces. It&rsquo;s a classic catch-22 for LEGO, they need to satisfy the IP holder, but they need something people will recognise. While the film is fresh in peoples head the design is great, given a few years I think <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9473-1/The-Mines-of-Moria"">9473: The Mines of Moria</a> or <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79004-1/Barrel-Escape"">79004: Barrel Escape</a> will be far more memorable to the films and therefore better long term sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a completely mixed bag for me. I love that we got Middle Earth LEGO, but this as a finale serves as a massive reminder as to how mishandled the theme was. Looking at the set again with fresh eyes I still see it as more valuable to me personally as a parts pack, and that to me says that the set is not as good as it might have been. I&rsquo;m sure that it will appeal a lot more to plenty of other people, but I think if I want to make a new home for my Smaug I&rsquo;ll make him a giant nest of gold and be happier than having this set displayed.</p>
