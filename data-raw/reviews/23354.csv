Not too much to say on the set other than the minifigs, but I&#39;ll hit the points for those considering buying one (or more) of this set.</p>

<h2>Box/Instructions</h2>

<p>Nice new color scheme for the boxes, featuring green trim at the top and the new &quot;Battle of the Five Armies&quot; sub-theme. All three minifigs are clearly displayed, including alternate faces and the glowing head of the Witch-King.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Here is the real winner for this set! You get THREE amazing minifigs in this set!</p>

<p><strong>Witch-King:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="""" height=""321"" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f352/jljohnson814/Lego%20Reviews/79015%20Witch-King%20Battle/79015_witch_king_front_zps3691f7cd.jpg"" width=""200"" /><img alt="""" height=""268"" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f352/jljohnson814/Lego%20Reviews/79015%20Witch-King%20Battle/79015_witch_king_back_zpsfaef083c.jpg"" width=""200"" /><img alt="""" height=""318"" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f352/jljohnson814/Lego%20Reviews/79015%20Witch-King%20Battle/79015_witch_king_print_zps75bc9806.jpg"" width=""200"" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the Witch-King has some very nicely printed pieces, with print on fronts and backs of everything except the pants. The crown is also very well designed and fits quite snug atop his head.</p>

<p><strong>Lord Elrond:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="""" height=""218"" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f352/jljohnson814/Lego%20Reviews/79015%20Witch-King%20Battle/79015_elrond_front_zpsf09f6d5f.jpg"" width=""200"" /><img alt="""" height=""240"" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f352/jljohnson814/Lego%20Reviews/79015%20Witch-King%20Battle/79015_elrond_back_zps6094bb63.jpg"" width=""200"" /></p>

<p>Elrond looks great as well. Like Witch-King, his print is front and back of everything except the pants. His cloak is Olive Green, though the photos don&#39;t show it as well. Here are some pictures of other Elrond minifigs (From 79006 and 5000202):</p>

<p><strong>Lady Galadriel:</strong></p>

<p><img alt="""" height=""285"" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f352/jljohnson814/Lego%20Reviews/79015%20Witch-King%20Battle/79015_galadriel_front_zps6cfb1ad4.jpg"" width=""240"" /><img alt="""" height=""285"" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f352/jljohnson814/Lego%20Reviews/79015%20Witch-King%20Battle/79015_galadriel_back_zps5a6e4df3.jpg"" width=""205"" /><img alt="""" height=""286"" src=""http://i51.photobucket.com/albums/f352/jljohnson814/Lego%20Reviews/79015%20Witch-King%20Battle/79015_galadriel_print_zpse9ee99bf.jpg"" width=""222"" /></p>

<p>By far my favorite minifig in this set! Beautifully painted torso and sloped bottom, and her hair is pearl gold! Alternate &quot;crazy&quot; face we&#39;ve seen in the Lord of the Rings as well. Great for Mocs! I&#39;ve been waiting for this figure for a while, and can now replace my &quot;stand-in&quot; I&#39;ve been using for a few mocs. Others must have felt the same because I sold several custom Galadriel figs online.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The build itself wasn&#39;t anything special. I didn&#39;t recognize anything as new, but there are a few profile bricks and a full skeleton. The set is &quot;modular&quot;, but I&#39;m not entirely sure why. Also, there is some technic parts in the back that don&#39;t do anything. Perhaps someone has found where these hook into an existing set, but I tried with Dol Guldur and had no luck finding suitable attachment points.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>This set is a must have for any LotR / Hobbit fan! The Minifigs are simply stunning, and for a small selling price too! Considering many LotR minifigures (including the custom Galadriel I included here) can be found on Ebay and Bricklink for $10+ (US), getting all three for only $15 (US) is a real bargain!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy the set as much as I did!</p>

"Hylocera","2014-10-26T22:14:56.503Z","Nice Minifigs and Nice Value","<p>Pretty good value for a $15 set, especially considering how overpriced sets are these days. With a few extra parts here and there I could easily see this being $20. Thank goodness it&#39;s not.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Very shiny box; seems to be of a higher quality than older boxes, though I haven&#39;t bought a set since the Winter Village Market almost a year ago. Instructions are folded in half as usual and don&#39;t want to stay open as usual but this problem can be easily fixed by squashing the manual with a heavy objects for a couple minutes......as usual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set is small (101 pieces) but has a good quantity of useful parts. There are <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6000311"">6 of the newish 1x2 bricks</a>&nbsp;in dark&nbsp;bley, a round window piece that here is used as a drain/gutter/sewer of some sort, and a whole pile of small brown parts that are good for making trees.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs are the only reason you should buy this set. Elrond has a pearl gold torso (the first torso I have seen in this color), an olive green cape, and a nice rubber hair piece, all of which look very good. Galadriel has one of those improvised&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6084644"">dress pieces</a>, a cape <strong>covered in glittery bits</strong> on one side and a rubber hair piece that is the same mold as Elrond&#39;s but blonde rather rather than brown. The Witch-King has a crown of the same material as the elves&#39; hair, a&nbsp;<strong>fantastic torn cape</strong> and a&nbsp;glow-in-the-dark head. All three figs&nbsp;have highly detailed facial expressions, and all have double-sided heads, though the back of the Witch-King&#39;s head is only printed with some hair, not another face. The printing overall is great, and the <strong>three capes are completely worth the money</strong>. The hair pieces come in little plastic bags, though the crown does not. There is also a normal skeleton.</p>

<p>My only concern with the minifigs is that Galadriel&#39;s cape is flattened and creased inward as a result of her hair and skirt sandwiching it. I have yet to see if this will damage the fabric in the long run but would probably disassemble/modify the minifigure as soon as possible to keep this spectacular piece in good shape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building process is pretty standard, not many surprises. There are two functions: a weird spinny platform for the Witch-King and a handle to spin it with and a small catapult. The catapult has the torso and arms of the skeletons attached to it, which is pretty creepy...especially since that is the part you press on to launch the catapult&#39;s projectiles.</p>

<p>The set gets a 3 for building experience only because it is a small set, not because it is boring or obnoxious in any way.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set is mostly normal stuff that is simply there to give the minifigures a background and space to fight on. Although it is simple it does its job, and definitely adds a lot to the already amazing minifigures. A minifigure can be attached to the spinny platform so that he can &quot;swing&quot; his weapon, an odd though brilliant play feature that I have not seen before. Everything is quite compact and solid, so it is good for travel and those kinds of things.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m pretty pleased with this set, though I can&#39;t say the same for The Hobbit movies, but that&#39;s an entirely&nbsp;different discussion. I would pay $3-$5 just for each minifigure (not including the skeleton), because they look <strong>so</strong> darn good. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen&nbsp;three minifigures (skeleton excluded)&nbsp;this nice (and so far, this rare) in a set for less than $30. I would say get this set for the minifigures: there are four for $15. That is battle-pack level minifigure count, and this set is only barely more expensive than those ($14.99 vs. $12.99).</p>

<p><strong>An easy 5/5.</strong></p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-11-02T15:30:05.533Z","Lady Galadriel and Witch-King of Angmar Appear","<p><strong>Set #79015 Witch-king Battle:</strong> After three years of LEGO Hobbit and Lord of the Rings as part of the send off for this licensed Theme we received at very long last a Galadriel Minifigure. And what a great set to get her in too, because this puppy is the cheapest set of the wave&hellip; But is it any good? Well let&rsquo;s just see&hellip;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>This box showcases some nice action scene for the set, you get to see Galadriel facing a leaping Witch-king while Elrond is&hellip; doing something. It&rsquo;s a nice looking design that fits the Theme quite nicely and the back shows that you actually get 4 minifigures in this set as part of the play features.</p>

<p>The instructions, being for a smaller set, do not feature as many additional pages besides the instructions themselves. They show the big set with Smaug in the back as a cross-promotional image and there are no minifigure checklists in the back. The instructions are straightforward and easy to follow also. I find it odd that this manual doesn&rsquo;t mention the fact you can combine this with the 2013 Dol Guldur sets, while larger sets show off this feature in the back of their books with the pictures of the other sets in the wave included there.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Aside from the mason bricks there aren&rsquo;t too many parts that stand out as unique, considering this is a small set that is to expected. Still it&rsquo;s a very nice looking set with some decent parts to bulk up Dol Guldur if you wish.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Officially the set says three, unofficially you also get the parts for a fourth. Though some may not consider it a true minifigure.</p>

<p>Elrond: This version of Elrond looks really impressive; he&rsquo;s got his battle armor on a double-sided torso print and leg printing which is different from the print found on the giveaway Elrond we got with the LotR game. He&rsquo;s carrying the same golden elf sword though, and has the same hairpiece, his cape is a nice long one here and a decent green colour for elves. He&rsquo;s a great looking figure.</p>

<p>Galadriel: She&rsquo;s a much impressive looking minifigure, with a double-sided torso print, a sloped brick printed with the lower half of her flowing gown and bare arms. She&rsquo;s using the same hairpiece as Elrond and has a decent looking cape similar in style to Vitruvius&rsquo;. While her only accessory is the upside down diamond meant to represent her light shining gift to Samwise in the Lord of the Rings&hellip; Sorry I&rsquo;ve forgotten the name. Also both Elrond and Galadriel include double-sided facial prints.</p>

<p>Witch-King: This and Galadriel are the biggest draws for this set, the witch-king here is in his ghostly ring vision looking form that includes some impressive printing on his double-sided torso, his legs and the printing for his face, which includes back printing of his scraggly bit of hair. He also has the crown as a newly sculpted piece and his famous sword. The white cape may be the same as the one found with the Ringwraiths in Attack on Weathertop, it certainly looks identical. The head even glows in the dark, sadly the rest of him doesn&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>Skeleton: Your typical LEGO skeleton with battle droid arms, as part of the regular build the pieces of the skeleton are used as decoration. If you were interested in such a thing though you could rebuild him into a full-fledged minifigure.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This set has very little build to it, the model is meant more as a small set piece that attaches to Dol Guldur from the previous wave. It&rsquo;s a quick build that means you&rsquo;ll be playing with in no time&hellip; Unless you&rsquo;re an AFOL only looking to add to your Hobbit display&hellip; Which I will admit is probably a rare sight because playing with LEGO even for an AFOL is still pretty fun. Er I digress though, the build doesn&rsquo;t take to long and then you get&hellip;</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Really as I said there isn&rsquo;t much to this, it&rsquo;s meant to be added to Dol Guldur. It&rsquo;s just a crumbling piece of ruins with a tree growing out of it. There are two play features with the set, on one side is a small disk that can turn side to side, this is meant to allow you to have the witch-king back and forth to swing his sword at the elves&hellip; It&rsquo;s kind of bland honestly.</p>

<p>The better play feature is the catapult, it launches two orange translucent cylinders to fire at the elves, pretending that you can fire, fire at them. It&rsquo;s a very functional play feature because it works so well, just pressing down on the skeleton torso (which is used as the launch lever) will send the cylinders flying a considerable distance. (Try not to lose the projectiles.)</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This set&rsquo;s biggest selling point is the minifigures as the model is rather uninteresting and doesn&rsquo;t include much to it which is why I&rsquo;d hesitate to recommend this set as a LEGO model. It&rsquo;s a great set to get some characters we&rsquo;ve all been wanting for some time, Galadriel is awesome and the Witch-king looks suitably evil. Also his crown is an awesome new sculpt that&hellip; we might never see again, so buying multiples just to use it for MOC characters wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad deal, since the price is so good.</p>

"lkb57","2014-12-30T18:12:07.65Z","Elrond, Galadriel, and the Witch-King: Must Have Minifigures!","<p>I was blown away by the minifigures in this set! Each one is a little work of art that does a great job capturing the &quot;spirit&quot; of Elrond, Galadriel, and the ghostly Witch-King. The Witch-King in particular is an amazing little piece, and well worth the cost.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest, you don&#39;t buy this set for the pieces, or the joy of building . . . you buy it to get your hands on the minifigs.</p>

<p>As I mentioned above, the Witch-King was far and away the best part of this set and the stand-out minifig of the three. He is crowned in a pearl-grey, spikey crown that actually more closely resembles the crown <a href=""https://atolkienistperspective.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fotr-vs-auj-nazgul.jpg"">he is seen wearing</a> in Fellowship of the Ring than the own we see him wearing in the Hobbit films. His torso is printed front and back with tattered, but regal-looking robes, and the printing is continued on his legs. The printing is a really cool combination of white, grey and sickly green that really plays up the &quot;ghostly&quot; quality of the minifigure. My favorite part of this guy is the printing on his head, which perfectly captures the puckered, almost mummified look of the Witch-King in the films. The fig&#39;s white cape is the same tattered pattern used for the <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor018/Ringwraith"">Black Riders</a>, but white instead of black.</p>

<p>This set includes the <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs?query=Elrond"">third Elrond variant </a>we&#39;ve seen. At a glance, this new Elrond&nbsp;closely resembles the Second Age Elrond&nbsp;minfig in both design and color; however, there are some cool differences that make it worth collecting both minifigs. The elven&nbsp;armor on this new Elrond is printed on both the front and back of the torso and the pattern continues on the legs, and very nicely captures the look of the organic plate armor that the elves wear in the films. Like most of the LOTR/Hobbit, Elrond has printing on both the front and back of his head (a &quot;serious&quot; and &quot;angry&quot; expression). He features a gold-crowned elven headpeice.&nbsp;Perhaps the best thing about this minifigure&nbsp;is that he can be used as an elven army builder if you&#39;re a castle or LOTR MOC-er. No skin is visible on the torso, so you could switch pieces out for either flesh or yellow-colored minifig pieces depending on your preferences.</p>

<p>LOTR/Hobbit fans have been hoping for a Galadriel minifigure ever since the themes were announced. This minifigure does not disappoint. She features a silver-crowned elven&nbsp;headpiece and a two-sided&nbsp;head featuring a &quot;neutral&quot; face and a (for lack of a better phrase) &quot;Ring-possessed&quot; face . . . if you&#39;ve seen either Fellowship of the Ring or The Battle of the Five Armies, that will probably make sense. Her cape is a pretty cool glitter-white that I&#39;ve never seen before. Her torso is printed front and back in a cool silver-white dress design. The&nbsp;pattern is continued on her dress slope piece . . . the printing doesn&#39;t line up perfectly between the torso and the dress slope, but its not a huge problem. I have to admit, I was pretty excited to see the includion of the Phial of Galadriel in the form of a white jewel piece. Probably the most exciting thing about this minifig is that it will make a great addition to MOCs featuring the Fellowship in Lothlorien, or the White Council in Rivendell.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a must-have, not for the pieces or&nbsp;the joy of building, but simply because the minifigs are so cool. They&#39;re sure to be sought-after by both collectors and LOTR/Hobbit and castle MOC-ers, and I&#39;m positive that the after-market value of both Galadriel and the Witch-King is going to be astronomical,&nbsp;so snap this set up as soon as you get the chance.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Same old, same old.</p>

<p>Actually a few of the parts can be used for other things. I tried to add some of these to my Vampyre Castle and they fit in quite well with that set.</p>

<p>Best minifigures I&#39;ve ever seen in a battle pack/small set. You get an amazing Elrond, an even more sophisticated Witch-King of Angmar&nbsp;(who, I might add, also glows in the dark), and then you get Galadriel. Galadriel is the best out of the three in my opinion, she is a beautifully done figure. All three are well designed.</p>

<p>The build I found to be boring, but again, that is to be expected.</p>

"Sarky","2015-02-18T07:17:47.2Z","Terrible build, nice minifigs","<h3>Box</h3>

<p>The front shows the set in its entirety and a bit of background. As usual, the back shows the functions of the set, and the glow-in-the-dark Witch-king head.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The little Dul Guldor build contains some nice dark red leaves and brick-textured pieces. There are also some more pieces in rare colors. This set also has parts to build a complete skeleton. But the instructions tell to put the parts in &#39;random&#39; places to blend with the build and make the place scarier :)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs are (as with many licensed sets) the main reasons to buy this set. In this set we get Elrond, Galadriel, and the Witch-King of Angmar.</p>

<p>This version of Elrond is a new minifigure and is very detailed with a nice green cape and a golden crown printed on his hairpiece. His torso has some armour detailing. He comes with a great&nbsp;elven&nbsp;sword.</p>

<p>Galadriel is also a new minfigure and very nicely done. She has a sparkly white cape and a silver crown. She comes with a crystal in her hand, probably the Phial of Galadriel.</p>

<p>The Witch-King is probably the most anticipated minifigure in this set. He has a tattered white cape and comes with a black sword. His crown molding is new and the robe printing on his torso continues down to his legs. I&#39;m sure whether I&#39;m doing it wrong or if my Witch-King is defective, but it seems that it isn&#39;t glowing in the dark. Hmmm....weird.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not that interesting build. Takes about 5 minutes I would say.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model here is a part of Dol Guldor. The build features a rotating platform for the Witch-King and also has a catapult that can launch red cylinder pieces. There are two separate parts to the mode and these two parts can separate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Frankly, the minifures are the only reason to buy this set. Besides the few functions of the model, there really is nothing else to do. I would think that this set is geared more towards AFOLs who are collectors. If you are not interested in the minifigs, you shouldn&#39;t buy this set.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-11-24T04:29:10.873Z","Get it for the minifigures ","<p>As I&#39;m sure you can tell from the pictures, this set is a battle pack, and is more like a Star Wars battle pack than a LOTR&nbsp;battle pack in that it has a very small build. It also differs from the other smaller LOTR sets (Wizard Battle, Riddle for the Ring, Gandalf Arrives) in that it doesn&#39;t do a very good job of portraying a particular scene. Of course those other sets only had two minifigures and this one has three.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>The Witch King, unlike in Attack on Weathertop, is all white as he is a ghost. That said he looks very good and his crown in my opinion looks a lot better than the hoods the nazguls&nbsp;wear on Weathertop. His cape is actually identical to the capes of his counterparts in Weathertop, only this time its in white. Definitely a great looking figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elrond&nbsp;is also a new one. While the Council of Elrond came with one of his minifigures, he was dressed in his robes he wears in Rivendell. This time he is dressed in armor and ready for battle. I will say he isn&#39;t quite as recognizable as he is in his Rivendell attire, but he does look great despite this fact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally in this set we also get Galadriel. Like the Arwen minifigure, she too has a dress for legs, but this time I&#39;m actually alright with that (Arwen rides a horse, she needs legs). Her hair piece is similar to Elrond&#39;s&nbsp;except that she has a silver as opposed to a gold crown. Her weapon appears to be the Light of Earendil, which she will ultimately gift to Frodo. However my favorite part of her is her second facial expression which I think represents her face after Frodo offers her the ring. This is the only instance where a minifigure who appears in both stories can effectively be used in both stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Technically there is a fourth minifigure, a skeleton, although his body parts are used as decorations and functional elements throughout the set. So since he isn&#39;t assembled, I guess he doesn&#39;t count, but he is a standard skeleton.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;The Model</b></p>

<p>Lets just say this is a very fast and simple build, but you really can&#39;t expect anything mind blowing from such a small set. As a stand-alone model, I&#39;d say this one is very weak. In fact, if I didn&#39;t already know this was at Dol Guldor, I&#39;d probably have no idea of which locale it was referencing. This is rather disappointing since the equally small Riddle for the Ring clearly is referencing a cave, while the Wizard Battle is obviously Saruman&#39;s throne room. It really does seem that Lego dropped the ball here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now this set does have two play features, which I find pretty impressive for a set of this size. The first is a catapult that works surprisingly well. I thought it would fail due to its limited range of motion, but amazingly its ability to throw projectiles isn&#39;t hindered at all. Second is a rotating stud that the Witch King can stand on and swing his sword against attacking minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course the real value in this model is that it is an expansion pack for the larger Dol Guldor set. I won&#39;t get into how this set compliments a much larger set, I will instead discuss that in the other sets review. However, this set does have one huge flaw in its expansion capabilities. Only half of this set (and not the half with the catapult) can be added to Dol Guldor. What is the point of cutting an already tiny set in half?</p>

<p>If you can get this set cheap it is certainly worth it for the minifigures, but I can really only recommend it if you want the minifigures, or if you are trying to collect every LOTR set, otherwise, this set doesn&#39;t really give you anything of value.&nbsp;</p>
