<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is actually a foil bag, but it does re-seal for storage or display - invoking hard sci-fi vibes with the foil material. The art on the front instantly caught my attention and played a significant role in my decision to pick this set up.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;Excluding minifigs, the most notable pieces are the red &quot;egg&quot; pieces, the gold saws, the green lightsaber blades, and the (then) new blaster piece. Thankfully, there are no stickers - everything is printed!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Rocka is a well-designed figure that stands a bit taller than the average minfig. The detail is appealing and the character is recognizable compared to its previous bigger iterations. A transparent green head piece under the helmet would have been preferable.</p>

<p>The &quot;bug&quot; (referred to in the story as a &quot;jumper&quot;) is made of three pieces, an improvement compared to the BIONICLE Visorak minifigs of old. Pressing on the back and releasing causes it to jump significantly far.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build mostly focuses on the mech, which is enjoyable for a quick cheap build. No interesting techniques are used, but the build is still entertaining.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The mech&nbsp;stands about 4 to 5 inches tall, and is easy to pose. The lack of knees is restrictive, but given the size of the mech, is not inhibitive to play. Rocka fits in the seat easily.</p>

<p>The red &quot;egg&quot; fits both the bug and Rocka, and the red leaf-things can open to create a hatched egg.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a brilliantly designed set - a different but refreshing take on the HERO Factory theme. This is a good introduction to the IVB series and is certainly recommended.</p>
