"Patch22","2014-08-11T19:56:05.963Z","44024: Tunneler Beast Review.","<p>This is the first of the new Invasion from below&nbsp;Hero Factory sets I will be reviewing and I will probably review the other Beast sets soon.</p>

<p>So anyway, Now I&#39;ll get to the actual review.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Package/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is a bag like most Hero Factory sets recently and has artwork of Tunneler Beast and Surge on the top.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are easy to follow and I can&#39;t spot any mystakes in them.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are pretty cool and it comes with one of the new cocoon pieces plus a new print on the Invasion from Below Beast head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The Surge Minifigure is pretty cool and I really like the new pieces in blue, although Surge&#39;s Helmet dosen&#39;t look much like his helmet from the old sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Surge has a gun, the one that was used in Star Wars this year and Surge also has Sliver Armour.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly simple and doesn&#39;t take long to finish, but the is still fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model looks great and I really like how they managed to fit all the legs on Tunneler Beast and overall Tunneler Beast looks awesome.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>An awesome set, that is worth buying for pieces or the model itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;d&nbsp;recommend this set to anyone who likes Hero Factory.</p>

"GBP_Chris","2014-08-30T20:10:50.69Z","Interesting Set - Is HERO Factory Making A Comeback?","<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">I&#39;ve never been much of a HERO Factory fan, but as soon as Invasion From Below came out, Lego caught my attention. And while I never intended on buying a set, this one caught my attention.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Insanity? No way, bro. Surprisingly, it&#39;s actually a decently good set!</p>

<h3 style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Box/Instructions</h3>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The box is actually a foil bag, but the cool part is that the bag re-seals so you can keep your set contained. While some BIONICLE fans would rather have canisters, I disagree - if anything, the bag feels more&nbsp;sci-fi-y&nbsp;(for lack of a better word) and fits the theme better. And it&#39;s downright eye-catching. The art on the front instantly caught my attention and seriously played a role in my decision to pick this set up.</p>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The instructions have a comic at the beginning, which is no big deal except for the fact that it&#39;s a lot darker than expected. HERO Factory used to be a&nbsp;cutsy&nbsp;wootsy&nbsp;little robot theme with all of their other storylines, but this time around, Lego created something darker and more serious. And when I watched the Invasion From Below video, I saw the same thing. All of this is to say that Lego did something amazing here - they created a HERO Factory that we can take seriously.</p>

<h3 style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Parts</h3>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The part assortment is decent, although not special. Surge&#39;s gun and holographic projector are the most interesting, but the back abdomen piece on the beast and the beast&#39;s head are worth nothing.</p>

<h3 style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Minifigures</h3>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Surge&nbsp;is a well-designed&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;that stands a bit taller than the average&nbsp;minfig. The detail is very intricate and after comparing him to his last few year&#39;s versions, you can recognize immediately who he is. My only complaint is that his red head piece under the helmet should have been yellow and&nbsp;transparent, but what we have for now is a-okay. I&#39;ll probably look into replacing that at some point.</p>

<h3 style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The build</h3>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The build mostly focuses on the&nbsp;beast, which is enjoyable for a quick cheap build. No interesting techniques are used, but certain sections are entertaining, like the claws and the midsection area.</p>

<h3 style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The completed model</h3>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The beast&nbsp;stands about 3 inches tall, but is about 5 or 6 inches long. It is really easy to pose, and yes, Surge mostly fits in the mouth. :) However, I wish that the abdomen was the same design as the three-&quot;leafed&quot; egg that we see in all the other sets. That was, you could place Surge as a captive in an &quot;egg sack&quot; type thing. However weird it sounds, it&#39;s a decent idea.</p>

<h3 style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px; font-weight: normal; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Overall opinion</h3>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Overall, I&#39;ll give this set a 4 out of 5. It&#39;s a brilliantly designed set that is really fun and catches your attention easily. Before, I disdained HERO Factory and labeled it as crap. But even with such a &quot;meh&quot; set, it&#39;s a vast improvement compared to the Brain Attack series. I&#39;ll definitely be looking for the rest of the Invasion From Below sets.</p>
