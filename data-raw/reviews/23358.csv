<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The bag had a nice design on it, always enjoy the bag. The instructions were smaller than I expected but wasn&#39;t&nbsp;hard to understand.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set includes a lot of trans. Lt.&nbsp;Blue&nbsp;parts. Armor, head, even the &quot;bones&quot; were Trans. Lt. Blue! They are really useful pieces, but the other pieces are good too. The most interesting pieces are the Trans. Lt. Blue pieces, the new stud-gun, the green&nbsp;spikes (once only in red), the cocoon, the printed chest piece, and Bulk&#39;s helmet.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Bulk Minifigure&nbsp;uses Silver HF Mini Hero&nbsp;parts! His design fits him but why the rocket boots?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build want hard at all. The only challenging part will be the adjustment to the Grabbing Staff thing. The build is easy yet fun. Matches the age range nicely.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks nice. Have a light behind Crystal Beast and he glows! ^_^ A little weird&nbsp;to have the hands the way they are but I like them. Not the best but they did their best.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a 4-5 set to me. The neck is too long. Would&#39;ve&nbsp;been better with a size 3 Trans. Lt. Blue bone piece (like the legs, arms, tail). The staff is not necessary. Crystal Beast looks more of a beast who would use his clawed hands than a staff. His hands are a little different than I thought, but overall this set is good if you want another enemy in your collection. Again, 4-5 from me. Don&#39;t let this review make your opinions change. Get it for yourself and make your own opinions. This set now has one review and Im happy it was me ^_^. Renzari&nbsp;&quot;logging off&quot;</p>
