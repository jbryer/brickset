<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kai:</strong></p>

<p>Kai is one of the best ninja, in my opinion. In this set (just like the Kai Fighter), he is in his Rebooted Techno-suit, and has his Techno-blade. Plus he drives this heck of a machine!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nindroid (with the jetpack):</strong></p>

<p>This Nindroid is thinking with a damaged brain. I mean, what is he thinking?! Flying, while the X-1 Ninja Charger can shoot him with the Spring-loaded Shooter! Not very smart, yet perfect. He&#39;s weakening his chances of getting shot by going into small spaces, where only the X-1 Ninja Charger&#39;s hidden eject motorcycle can fit. Very clever Nindroid. Very clever. Anyway, he comes as a standard Nindroid, along with the glider, of course.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Nindroid (that rides the glider):</strong></p>

<p>Again, not very smart. This is wider than the glider, and it can&#39;t fit in small spaces. Looks like an easy target, if you ask me. Anyway, he comes as a standard Nindroid, along with his glider and blade.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Recon Nindroid:</strong></p>

<p>The Recon Nindroid is the small thing at the bottom right of the picture. I believe it is used as a hunter, to spot the ninja. He isn&#39;t much, but he is pretty cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now, for the pros and cons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>cool model</li>
	<li>detachable vehicle</li>
	<li>Spring-loaded Shooter</li>
	<li>Techno-blade #4</li>
	<li>cool features</li>
	<li>Nindroid vehicles</li>
	<li>Recon Nindroid</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>too expensive ($39.99 USD)</li>
	<li>difficulty with re-attaching motorcycle</li>
	<li>more models for others (Zane, Lloyd, Jay, Cole, Sensei Garmadon, Nya)?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly, I think this set is pretty cool. It was soooooooo worth the money!</p>
