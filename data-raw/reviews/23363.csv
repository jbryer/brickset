<p>The box art on this set is fantastic it really does the set justice and i give the Lego Company kudos on their box art on all sets they make these days. The size of the box is just the normal size of a set with over 1000 pieces which is quite large. The instructions came in a plastic sleeve with a cardboard backing like all large sets now and they were up to Lego standards.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set I was blown away by, their are great pieces and i believe all 1223 pieces can be used for MOCs&nbsp;if needed for that. Their are large rock pieces, windows, doors&nbsp;and many other great parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The amount of minifigures included in this set is fantastic you get 8 of them and none of them are bad minifigs at all. You get the much anticipated Overlord which is a brilliant minifig, you get Lloyd, Zane, Jay, Samurai X, and 3 Nindroids. Another note is that you get tons of weapons in the set, there are at least five Katanas in the spare pieces alone, and at least 8 in the set itself, and there are many other great weapons too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build of the set was really fun and i would recommend it could be built by any age over 7 but &nbsp;kids under that age could build it with help from their parents.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model of this set is just brilliant, it looks fantastic from any side you look at it, the details on the outside are just fantastic and there&nbsp;are many features which are all great, they&#39;re all fantastic and do something which is can go well with any set in the Ninjago theme, there are disc shooters, a spring loaded shooter, a bomb, cannons and more, you also get a really nicely built tripod walker which the Overlord sits on and it is really nice.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this set is absolutely fantastic and I&#39;m not just saying that&nbsp;as a massive fan of Ninjago, but because of all the features in the set, 8 minifigures, 1223 pieces and a retail price of $119.99 USD,&nbsp;89.99 pounds, and $169.99 AU, this set is definitely worth the money. All those stats speak for themselves, you get a very beautifully constructed temple which looks fantastic on any display shelf.</p>

"Duq","2016-08-27T19:46:49.967Z","Fantastic!!","<p>This set may have been overshadowed by the Temple of Airjitzu that was released the following year but that doesn&#39;t take away from the fact that this is a fabulous set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box shows the building in all its glory, surrounded by the various other elements in the set. Interesting to see that part of the tree is cropped and that the top of the building partly obscures the word Spinjitzu.<br />
Instructions come in three booklets; the first covers all the accessories and is a bit smaller, the second and third book cover the main building with the break at a seemingly random point.<br />
The cover of the instructions shows the name of the set in a number of languages. Apparently it&#39;s called &#39;The battle for Ninjago City&#39;, &#39;Ninjago City&#39; or &#39;The Temple of Ninjago City&#39; depending on where in the world you are.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s an enormous variety of parts in this set. Most are in the gorgeous combination of red, gold and dark green with grey and black in supporting roles.<br />
There are many interesting parts; the golden carriage wheels, the windows with a great dragon print, 2 dark grey BURPs, 10 &#39;A-frames&#39; for building at 45 degree angles, tree leaf pieces in dark green and dark red, weapons in pearl silver and lots of decorative parts in pearl gold.<br />
Apart from minifigure parts the dragon windows and dark green trap doors are unique to this set while the door frames in dark green have only been used once before, in the Winter Village Cottage.<br />
There are 15 stickers &nbsp;to be applied, most of them going on flags.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 8 minifigs in the set, 4 good guys and 4 bad guys.&nbsp;<br />
The Ninjas are Jay, Lloyd and Zane and there&#39;s the samurai Nya. I think this is my first Ninjago set where none of the Ninja&#39;s wear their usual headgear. All 4 wear big shoulder armour and have nicely printed torsos with Nya the only one to also have printed legs.<br />
The Overlord had a madly detailed torso and dress. There&#39;s an extra pair of legs in the set (without printing) for when he needs to be more active.<br />
All these minifigs are unique to this set. The overlords army consists of 2 Nindroid warriors and a Nindroid drone and these guys appear in other sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building is not difficult but good fun. While there may not be many new techniques (as you&#39;d expect in a set aimed at 9 year-olds) the set is full of interesting details. There are also some interesting mechanisms for defending the building. I especially liked the catapult-like launchers on the side of the tower.<br />
My favourite element to build was the dragon head at the front of the building. Very clever use of parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The building just looks fantastic! The designer did a fabulous job! It&#39;s an imposing building that&#39;s full of decoration and detail. My favourite part has to be that dragon head but I also love the windows. The tree deserves a special mention: it&#39;s a simple build but one of the best-looking trees I&#39;ve seen in official sets. The only thing that doesn&#39;t add much in terms of looks or function is the little arch (left in the background on the box).</p>

<p>This set has more play functions than I think I&#39;ve ever seen in a single set. The overlord has his err... contraption with movable legs and a shooter. Zane has a glider with flick-missiles. The building has trap doors and various weapons. All the characters have hand-held weapons and there&#39;s even a zip-line.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is just one of the best sets I&#39;ve built. It&#39;s got everything: it looks stunning, it&#39;s got great parts, lots of characters and great play functions.<br />
My least favourite element would be the Overlord&#39;s three-legged walker but even that has got great play potential and it includes some interesting parts.<br />
This set is now disappearing from shops but get it if you can, whether it&#39;s for yourself or for your children.</p>

"TimTam22","2017-11-21T08:34:52.79Z","Battle for Ninjago City - great playability and unique pieces","<p>As with most large LEGO sets, I got this set for Christmas, thus the average rating on value for money. Looking at the price of $120 on this site, it seems pretty cheap to me. I think that this is probably one of my favourite&nbsp;Ninjago&nbsp;sets so far, as it has many unique and colorful bricks.</p>

<p>It was brilliant to build. The immense detail in the printed parts, mostly on the minifigures, blew me away. I was impressed that even in the relatively boring-looking bottom floor (or basement, whichever one works for you,) there were lots of different features. Some of my favourite features of the set include the rotating weapon racks that appear to be a solid rock wall, the stairs that eject minifigures when a button is pressed, and the hidden cannon that shoots through a flap in the roof. It was a great build, from making the minifigs at the start to putting the final touches on the roof.</p>

<p>Many of the before-mentioned features are easily accessible, the only problem with this being the basement - sometimes I have accidentally knocked a minifg&nbsp;to the back of the room, and had to almost pull the set apart to get it back out. The zipline going from the roof to the tree was a very good idea, but didn&#39;t really work. As the tree is not connected to the building, when you place a minifigure on the zipline, the tree manages to move closer, making the feature pretty redundant. For stop-motion movie-making purposes, the big doors can make some pretty cool openings (pun intended) to your scene.</p>

<p>The set was jam-packed with interesting parts, from the fancy circular golden swirly things visible on the temple in the image to the techno-blade toppers, which can make for some very interesting decorations in a build. The set is not too monotonous with the colour scheme, it has a nice mixture of greys, reds, and greens, which I have used for various Christmas-themed builds.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is a marvelous way for the LEGO group to top off the robot-centred Ninjago&nbsp;series, with wonderful pieces, building experience, and accessibility.</p>
