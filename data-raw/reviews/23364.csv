<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A standard box, showing the Battle of Hoth. It has a good depiction of the minifigures and set on the front, and all the play features on the back.<br />
<br />
I also got a poster featuring the AT-AT fighting off a snowspeeder, and on the reverse has a list of all the minifigures from this launch.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>If I didn&#39;t know what I&#39;d bought and unpacked everything, I&#39;d think I was building a castle.<br />
<br />
There are a ton (tonne?) of greys of every size and shape, a good number of technic&nbsp;pins and other pieces, I mean I&#39;m sure there are cheaper kits out there for it, but for any MOCers out there, there are a huge number of pieces that could be very useful. To be entirely honest though, this model is never being ripped down.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get General Meers, a pilot for the AT-AT and three snowtroopers, including a commander.<br />
<br />
Meers has some nifty details, and I don&#39;t know what other sets he has been in. However, this version of him is brand new with a custom helmet, very detailed torso and a recognizable facial expression.</p>

<p>The pilot is a palette swap of the Imperial Pilots from Tie Fighters and other original trilogy starships. That being said, the greys and blues do give him a rather unique look, and the patterns does lend some very nice detail. He comes with a blaster pistol, I suppose in case the walker has one of those bigger ships crash into it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The snowtroopers are advertised as being new, and it took me a while to notice some differences between the older and new versions. It&#39;s in the chest from what I can tell. I still have very little negative to say about them. The commander is distinguished by not having the &quot;skirt&quot; the other two have, along gray gloves. All three have blaster rifles.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was a very interesting build. 8 bags, with 7 numbers, had to be assembled. Full disclosure, while building the legs, both bags labeled&nbsp;5, the power went out across half my town, so I had two large-ish bags dumped out on my table and nothing but flashlights to guide my way.<br />
<br />
Until that point, the build was actually fairly interesting, starting with the base of the body, building up the front and back, started the plating, and then zap, black out. The leg build seems like it would be tedious as it was, but with no strong lighting, it took far longer then I think it would have under normal circumstances. The legs were mostly technic pins and pieces with plates hiding them from the outside. The articulation is top notch however, and that is where I thought this set would lose it&#39;s realism.</p>

<p>The head was my favorite part of the build however. The attachments&nbsp;to the body were added progressively, and the double jointed articulation to get the angles just right (when compared to the movies) was greatly appriciated.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is stunning. I was not expecting the sheer size and magnificence of it. It dwarfs everything in my collection, save the Tower of Orthanc. It&#39;s almost as tall, but much longer, than Jabba&#39;s&nbsp;Palace, with the Rancor Pit under it, it makes the Simpsons house, Millennium Falcon, Arkham Asylum and even the battle of Helm&#39;s Deep (with the separate&nbsp;extra wall piece attached) all look...well dinky.</p>

<p>This is exactly what a set like this should be about. Tall, hefty, solid and terrifying (if you were a minifigure that is...heck even an action figure or G.I. Joe sized toys).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Neither set I told myself I&#39;d buy&nbsp;were available when I got in, so I &quot;settled&quot; for this guy as one of the most recognizable vehicles from one of my favorite movies as a child. I thought it would look neat up on my wall, and I was right. It completely surpassed my expectations. The only &quot;negative&quot; I had was the repetition of building four identical and huge legs for this beast, but impression it gives off more then makes up for it.</p>

"HikerCZ","2014-11-16T12:38:03.74Z","You're going to love this pet...","<p>Although being a fan of Star Wars Lego for some time I had never owned an AT-AT set, which I always regretted. However, the new Lego policy of fighting the secondary market has seen a number of sets being remade and I&#39;m pretty sure many of us have benefited from this trend.</p>

<p>Therefore seizing a brand new AT-AT was a no-brainer. Before an actual purchase I watched some video reviews and I would strongly recommend doing that especially for size comparisons. As I understand this version is one of the less bulky versions of the walker but should be about the same size as the 2010 incarnation. Speaking of which - many fans have complained that it is a virtual copy and yes, it is basically the same model with a number of interesting updates or modifications. This would also mean that the last version was a pretty good one when you design your new version based on it. The latest version is nevertheless sleeker, more refined, the colour scheme is better balanced. Visually I&#39;m pretty happy with the model, the only complaint could be about the exposed rear of the cabin and the neck but it&#39;s an acceptable compromise. Also the front gun turrets are now stationary (in some versions they were rotating). Compared to the &#39;real thing&#39; I believe the designers have done a good job. Lego Technic pieces and Star Wars go very well together.</p>

<p>Speaking of Technic - this build is probably not for small kids. The sheer number of various pins, axles and connectors and interesting Technic solutions (unfamiliar to any non-Technic person) is a real challenge and takes time and patience and a strong fingers. For me definitely a more complex Star Wars set. Luckily most of these builds are cleverly disguised and render the final model extremely sturdy and functional at the same time.</p>

<p>Another important difference from 2010 is connected with the minifigs - only 5 and only Empire. For some this might be disappointing, I really didn&#39;t mind, I have plenty of Hans and Lukes. To compensate for a smaller number of figs, you get new prints, colours and faces. I do like the new stormtroopers (angry pink faces are better than empty black skulls from the past days in my opinion although I really enjoyed&nbsp;the black hoodie version with a stubble and an evil grin, however, now you can easily use these minifigs for any other purposes).</p>

<p>One issue which will be tough to swallow is the price. The recommended EU price is quite exorbitant, I would never pay 120 EUR for it. Luckily, I was able to get it for less than 100 EUR so I recommend that you wait and get it with a discount because if you don&#39;t have an AT-AT yet, you should definitely get this one. It&#39;s a very nice model to look at, very photogenic, you can pose it in a number of ways and many reviewers agree it is the best-looking incarnation yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

"youri8","2014-12-23T23:16:18.95Z","First Star Wars set since 2006!","<p>This is my first LEGO Star Wars set since 2006! I believe the V-Wing of that year was my last Star Wars set and one of my last Lego sets overall! This set however did not really get me out of the &#39;&#39;dark ages&#39;&#39; since I&#39;ve been building a city&nbsp;with my old Lego (you could say its the first set I&nbsp;bought since my&nbsp;dark ages).&nbsp;Oh well, let&#39;s start with the review!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Not a very large box as you might expect from this price range but still pretty large indeed (48&nbsp;x 38 x 7 cm). Very nice box art I must say with the battle of Hoth going on there, although I think it doesn&#39;t justify it&#39;s real life size with the oversized minifigs next to it, oh well.</p>

<p>Includes 2 instruction booklets of decent size, easy to follow, shows you which bags to grap and which parts you need for each step (I remember them being harder back in the days :P)</p>

<p>Also includes&nbsp;a very nice poster with all the Star Wars minifigs from 2014 I believe, AT-AT in action on the other side.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set includes&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of grey (obviously) and interesting technic parts which some of them I have never seen before. Everything comes in sorted bags as i stated before.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Now minifig wise I think they are awesome, you get 2x Snowtroopers, 1x Snowtrooper Commander, 1x General Veers and 1x AT-AT Driver,&nbsp;most detailed Snowtroopers so far! I wondered why the AT-AT driver has&nbsp;grey body armour/helm&nbsp;because&nbsp;in the previous AT-AT sets they were mainly white, but it seems grey is the correct color after some research. Now I think 5 minfigs is a bit low considering it&#39;s price tag, I think 2 or 3 rebels on a little cannon or something would have been a perfect addition (something like on the previous AT-AT)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Now the build was pretty decent seeing slowly your skeleton AT-AT grow in a fully build&nbsp;model is satisfying indeed. The only thing is that you have to do several steps 4 times over but in the end that&#39;s totally worth it!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model is very accurate compared to the &#39;real&#39; one in the movie detail wise, however the scale is not (Time for UCS AT-AT?).&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s 34x34cm,&nbsp;a minifigure is 4cm so 34 / 4 =&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5 x 1.80m(human size) = 15.3 meters however the real one would be 24 meters according to most resource sites. However it would take&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot more pieces (and would cost more of&nbsp;course)&nbsp;to make it minifigure&nbsp;scale and I think after all this is a really decent scale anyway! The legs can move with its joints&nbsp;and you could pose the whole thing in many ways, it&#39;s very sturdy, it will not fall easy!&nbsp;The flick missiles are fun to play with for kids, they shoot very far, but for the overall model look it&#39;s not very pretty I think. Also there is some sort of hatch/trap in the belly which you can pull open with a pin in the back, maybe to lower your snowtroopers or where Luke destroys the vehicle!&nbsp;In my opinion&nbsp;this is the most accurate looking Lego&nbsp;AT-AT in detail and size compared to other models. I love it!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am really liking this set because of it&#39;s accurate looks and details all around. However I think they should have added a couple more minifigures to match the price considering&nbsp;there are a&nbsp;lot of small pieces which makes the piece count so high. Awesome display model! 5/5</p>

"PooPotato","2015-05-01T05:03:28.553Z","Imperial Walkers On the North Ridge!","<p>After finishing my Battle of Geonosis&nbsp;diorama and clearing out some old sets, I had&nbsp;two shelves on my wall that were sitting empty, just waiting for new Star Wars sets. &nbsp;I immediately decided to dedicate one shelf to the Battle of Hoth. &nbsp;I do have a decent amount of sets that pertain to the battle, including 8089 Hoth Wampa Cave, 7749 Echo Base, both Hoth battlepacks that came out a couple of years ago, and my personal favorite, 4504 Millennium Falcon. &nbsp;I even threw in the wonderful AT-ST from 8038 Battle of Endor, as it is literally the only Battle of Endor set that I own. &nbsp;Even though I had all of these sets, I knew that I needed to get the final and most important piece: the AT-AT. &nbsp;There is no Battle of Hoth without this walker, and so on double VIP points week, I decided to purchase it and bring my diorama one huge step closer to being finished.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very sturdy, as are all of the new wave of Star Wars sets that have the Disney licensing on them. &nbsp;I actually folded up the box really nicely and stuffed it against the wall in my closet, just in case they come out with a UCS version of this walker, and I have to sell some more sets to make room. &nbsp;The instruction booklets were also very nice, considering they came in a sealed plastic bag with a cardboard slab to keep them flat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with a majority of Imperial/Republic vehicles, this set&#39;s part list is almost entirely comprised of dark and light grey pieces. &nbsp;There aren&#39;t any new pieces that shocked me, so there isn&#39;t that much to say here.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are five minifigures that come with this set, two of which&nbsp;are exclusive to this set:</p>

<p>General Veers is the first exclusive minifigure in this set. &nbsp;He&nbsp;is the feature villain in the Battle of Hoth, quickly being thrown into the commander&#39;s seat after Admiral Ozzel decided to come out of lightspeed too close to the planet. &nbsp;His minifigure counterpart is outstanding, and I would even go to say he has one of the most accurate&nbsp;heads I&#39;ve ever seen on a Star Wars minifigure. &nbsp;Fun Fact: He was actually scripted to die by his walker being rammed by a damaged snowspeeder, but this idea was scrapped and later used for the famous Super Star Destroyer destruction scene in ROTJ.</p>

<p>AT-AT Drivers are generally included with AT-ATs to, you know, drive them. &nbsp;I do happen to have a previous version of this minifig, included with 8084 that I was able to compare to this version. &nbsp;The new version wins in every way, with leg printing, a more correct color scheme, and an actual face underneath his helmet. &nbsp;If you are a minifigure hound and want this guy only, you can get him for a much cheaper $10 with&nbsp;the 75075 AT-AT microfighter.</p>

<p>Snowtrooper Commander is the other exclusive minifigure in this set. &nbsp;Although he&#39;s supposed to be a commander, there are very few signs of him actually being one. &nbsp;The only difference between him and his troops is that he doesn&#39;t have a backpack on, he has all white legs, and a microscopic rank insignia on his chest. &nbsp;He looks almost identical to his fellow troops, so he&#39;s not too exciting, but I do love the new Snowtrooper design, so I don&#39;t mind having him stick around.</p>

<p>The two Snowtroopers included with this set are absolutely superb. &nbsp;They are a definite improvement over their older counterparts in every way, with the leg protecting &quot;kamas&quot;, a helmet piece that is separate from the backpack, and a very accurate printed piece for the backpack that increases the look of this minifigure by a whole lot. &nbsp;It&#39;s a shame that Lego didn&#39;t make more Hoth&nbsp;battlepacks, as a whole army of these minifigures would look awesome.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>When I was a kid I used to hate the technic sections of a build. &nbsp;The pins hurt my fingers, and it seemed relatively boring to me at the time. &nbsp;However, I now find the technic portions of large builds like this to be fascinating, as you get to see how the set retains it&#39;s playability and structure without the unsightly showing of the technic pieces themselves. &nbsp;It&#39;s good that I had this change of heart, because the entire first half of this build is building the interior structure for the troop bay. &nbsp;I was very pleased with this part of the build, and I was very impressed how the distinctive angles were achieved. &nbsp;The legs were of course a bore to build, but they look very nice compared to previous versions of the AT-AT. &nbsp;One very notable thing to point out is that this set has ZERO stickers. &nbsp;This doesn&#39;t really affect me, because I don&#39;t really mind putting them on, but for some of you stickers are a life or death situation, so I felt that it should be noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks outstanding. &nbsp;The SNOT techniques make this behemoth look extremely accurate when compared to the film counterpart, which is as always my deciding factor of whether I like a Star Wars set or not. &nbsp;The foot structure works very well, and the poseability is almost unlimited. &nbsp;My only real complaint is that the head can only turn left and right, but I&#39;m not sure a technic ball and socket joint could have done the job. &nbsp;One of my favorite play features that I&#39;m very glad was included is the lever that activates the trap door in the troop bay. &nbsp;There are two spring loaded blasters underneath the head, but as with all other sets that have them, I remove them and keep them in a plastic bag. &nbsp;The handle for the lever is cleverly hidden at the, erm, <em>rear</em>&nbsp;of the walker, and it is simply activated by pulling on the lever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am very glad that I decided to purchase this set for my double VIP points. &nbsp;I regretted missing the previous versions of the AT-AT, but I am glad that I waited, as this is by far the most superior out of all of the ones that have been released so far. &nbsp;A UCS version might take the cake, but I highly doubt Lego would produce something that massive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Very accurate to source material</p>

<p>Great minifigures, 2 of which are exclusive</p>

<p>Poseability to the max!</p>

<p>Cool play features</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Very tedious to build the legs</p>

<p>Snowtrooper Commander could have been more interesting</p>

<p>Head can&#39;t turn up or down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I highly recommend this set, your Battle of Hoth diorama won&#39;t be complete without it!</p>

<p>As for my next set to review, it really depends on what&#39;s on sale during the May 4th sale event. &nbsp;Stick around for a massive review on 10188 Death Star, it should be finished sometime in May...</p>

"mickz","2015-03-01T04:23:01.92Z","2nd build AT-AT ","<p>As the title suggests, this is my second build. &nbsp;I cannot compare this to previously released models as I do not&nbsp;own any. &nbsp;This was a boxing day special when I purchased it and I only owned one other set at the time. &nbsp;I thought it would be a nice addition to a collector/fan, it didn&#39;t dissappoint.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box itself, I feel anyway, was large for the packets included measured at 47.5x37x6.5cm. &nbsp;The front of the box depicts the walker in a Hoth battle while the rear again depicts a Hoth&nbsp;battle with the cockpit open and body doors open. &nbsp;The rear also shows the features of the set.</p>

<p>2 instruction booklets and a poster were included. &nbsp;The poster is quite large (it would fill a half cover any door) and in vertical form shows a battle on Hoth and includes other sets relating to Hoth. &nbsp;On the reverse side of the poster is a view of minifigures released (for 2014 I&nbsp;assume)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There a 8 sealed bags in the box, however packet number 5 is duplicated. &nbsp;As you would expect mostly grey parts and a range of technic pieces such as pins, axles etc. &nbsp;Most parts are duplicated due to the symmetrical nature of this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get a total of 5 minifgures. &nbsp;As stated on the box, they are all new design. &nbsp;Again I can&#39;t comment on if they look better than previous versions as this is my second set.</p>

<p>2 x snowtroopers</p>

<p>1&nbsp;x snowtrooper commander</p>

<p>1 x AT-AT driver</p>

<p>1 x General Veers</p>

<p>Though this is only my second set, I am really liking the detail they put on the minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I was expecting a repetitive build due to the set&nbsp;being symmetrical and it did meet my expectations, nevertheless it was quite enjoyable. &nbsp;You begin by&nbsp;building the skeletal frame, which uses almost half the bags provided, then you build the feet, legs, add body armour and finally the head(cockpit) adding each as you continue to work through the bags.</p>

<p>As a &quot;born again&quot; AFOL it tool approximately 4 hours to build, which was spread out over two days and 2 hour sessions. &nbsp;I don&#39;t mind taking time to build and I can sit back after each bag and admire, take progressive photos, see how parts relate to the next steps etc.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Upon completion i sat back and looked. &quot;Wow&quot; what a good replica. &nbsp;I know from reading reviews, there is a lot of emphasis on scale, yes it may not be to minifigure scale, but if you can get past that, its a great looking model, standing at approximately 34cm high and having a length of 34cm. &nbsp;Depending on how you &quot;stand&quot; the model, the height may differ slightly, but I am only talking maybe +/- 1 cm.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&quot;Wow&quot; what a great looking replica. &nbsp;Although repetitive in build, it was good to build with a great result.</p>

"Kaisermighe","2018-09-28T14:08:36.32Z","Most iconic walker in Star Wars","<p>This was the 4th and probably best minifigure-size AT-AT walker Lego has produced yet. It came in summer 2014, it consisted of 1138 pieces and 5 minifigures and retailed for about 110$/120EU. Let&#39;s not forget that there&#39;s also a big poster!</p>

<p>The building process was interesting, all the interior is mainly&nbsp;technic bricks, although of course the four legs and foots, being all the same, are very boring. But this is not a designer&#39;s fault since that&#39;s how the walker is! And there&#39;s no stickers at all, which is awesome!!</p>

<p>I would have liked to see at least 1-2 minifigures&nbsp;more, 5 is just too little for a set this size. But all of them are very well done. They are all characters already done, but this remake from the classical look is more accurate to the movie. General Veers finally gets his sand blue armour and helmet, the AT-AT driver has grey instead of old style white for the helmet, and the snowtroopers have a new helmet piece and also a backpack and a kama!! It&#39;s interesting the inclusion of the snowtrooper commander, slightly different from the common snowtrooper private. So minifigures&nbsp;- it&#39;s a &quot;go&nbsp;for quality&quot; here.</p>

<p>The AT-AT itself is very big!! Being 37cm tall, this thing is massive. Although the&nbsp;head looks a little&nbsp;wierd compared to the rest of the body/legs, since it&#39;s disproportionate. But i prefer having it big enought&nbsp;so that is able to fit some figures rather than be more little but with no space. The build is strong and sturdy, with the exception of&nbsp;some little exposed plates which tend to fall if touched.</p>

<p>The main feature are the 4-posable legs, which works fantastic! I was afraid they were clumsy, but i am impressed with their articulations. It&#39;s easy to make a cool display pose while keep it stable, even with one leg lifted up!</p>

<p>The head is able to turn left-right, as well as the neck itself. Unfortunately you can&#39;t raise it up and down. You can open the hatch on top for seat the seated driver and the commander, standing up closely behind. With this little area to use, it&#39;s very good to be able to put 2 minifigures&nbsp;instead of the usual one with all the previous versions. Also at the bottom, well hidden from view there are 2 red spring-loaded shooters, easy to shoot, very well incorporated, they add some playability option without getting into the design of the thing. Not something so obvious these days.</p>

<p>Finally, the main body is very tall. You can raise the side panels to reveal the main area inside to keep your armed force. There is a good amount of space here, it&#39;s able to garrison up to 10 minifigures if kept close together, 6 with good distance.&nbsp;There&#39;s also a trap door&nbsp;on the floor, which opens pulling a well hidden bar in the back of the walker. There&#39;s something that captures me here, being it a classic feature of old Lego sets, seeing it without sense in this modern-age walker is very cool! But then of course you can use it as a hole in which to deploy your troopers, maybe a way to get to the ground, or as a wound done by Luke&#39;s lightsaber!(which is not here).</p>

<p>Man this set is awesome! The display of this iconic beast on your shelf is just mandatory, and it&#39;s also pretty good to be played with!! I&#39;m very satisfied with this set, i just could have been more happy if there&#39;s been some more minifigures and maybe some better neck articulation to raise up-down the head. I highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this set, it retailed for a fair price but&nbsp;nowadays it&#39;s becoming&nbsp;expensive to buy&nbsp;brand-new, so i suggest to buy it used if you don&#39;t have too much money, especially if you are&nbsp;a fan of Episode V/galactic empire/walkers/big stuff!! It will not disappoint!</p>
