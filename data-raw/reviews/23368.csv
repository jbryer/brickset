"zipsforbananas","2014-05-27T22:19:36.187Z","A fun little playset, charming and my highlight of the 2014 summer range.","<p>This is a great little set with a host of features. Those things and its size makes it my favourite of the 2014 summer sets, more full of features than the B-wing, but more attainable than either of the other mammoth sets - saying that I suppose there wasn&#39;t much competition!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is curiously wide and not very deep, allowing for a great picture showing off a widescreen shot, surely the best option for a set with different parts like this.<br />
(I can&#39;t think of much more to say about boxes and instructions that are largely the same across the TLG portfolio, I&#39;m amazed I said that much!)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set really excels at interesting parts, mainly due to the nougat parts in the Sandspeeder, but also a good number of detail elements like the drinks and bar elements (as in the cantina bar, not 4-long type bars!). And for a set you would imagine would be largely sand yellow it has a good mix of colours.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As usual with recent Star Wars sets the figures really stand out.<br />
<strong>Luke Skywalker</strong>&nbsp;is pretty disappointing to my mind; body and hair is good, but the overly detailed face (much commented on, and the punchline in the last issue of&nbsp;Hispabricks) ruins him. Where&#39;s the youthful hero of the 1977 film? Did the get Mark Hamill in and model it on how he looks today?<br />
<strong>Obi-Wan Kenobi</strong>&nbsp;is nice with leg printing extending his printed robes. He&#39;s different enough from any previous version to be a very nice figure to have for any collector.<br />
<strong>Han Solo</strong>&nbsp;is the same as the chibi Falcon version but for the face print. No complaints there though, he&#39;s a good figure, it&#39;s just there&#39;s nothing all that exciting about him!</p>

<p>On the other hand, I&#39;m very excited indeed about his jousting partner,&nbsp;<strong>Greedo</strong>, given how expensive his only other incarnation has become. I was quite surprised that his head is the usual ABS plastic, not the rubbery head I expected. He is fantastic top to bottom: great head mould, very nicely printed. Great to have a modern Greedo!<br />
And the three&nbsp;<strong>Bith Musicians</strong>&nbsp;are very nice too. There&#39;s not much that could be said of the modest torso print, but the heads are just superb, capturing the cantina band so perfectly and Lego-ly.<br />
The&nbsp;<strong>Sandtrooper</strong>? is improved again from the last Droid Escape version and with the black pauldron and printing on the torso to go with it he&#39;s the most accurate version yet. But pleasingly he&#39;s not so different that he looks odd next to the white and orange pauldroned&nbsp;ones. His head is also entirely flesh coloured, an improvement on the washed out printing, but I&#39;m old school and still prefer no faces on these characters whose faces you never see. The backpack breather units are the same as they&#39;ve always been.</p>

<p>And though not strictly a minifigure, the Dewback&nbsp;has to go here, and he&#39;s amazing! The shade of green is perfect and he absolutely makes my Tatooine&nbsp;scene! Only his mouth moves, but I don&#39;t mind that, and being able to take off the large saddle and smooth in his back will add a little playability.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For anyone who has or had the last Sandspeeder&nbsp;the first part of the build will be nothing really, the differences between the two versions is negligible, almost all colour changes, and a couple of simplifications. The combination&nbsp;of wall elements that filled in the sides is replaced with a 1x4&nbsp;round brick and a wall element, and the battered engine is now simply a different colour and stickered (so love it or hate it for stickers applied on round surfaces...).</p>

<p>The moisture vaporator is a nice little mini-build and breaks things up nicely before you head into the main cantina.</p>

<p>And the cantina construction is straightforward but engaging and fun with the different modules, hinged and sliding. There are some good touches with how the sliding parts go together and with the details particularly around the bar, and the entrance and sliding door are very interesting and round off the build nicely.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I won&#39;t say too much about the Sandspeeder as it&#39;s so close to the last version and there are reviews aplenty already if you want details. It&#39;s a nice model, perhaps closer in colour to the film-original though still not right. And I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s nostalgia for the last version or not but I don&#39;t really like the nougat. The colour seems too vivid/full/bright next to the characters, though next to the sand building the old sand wouldn&#39;t work either.</p>

<p>The little bits you get, the Dewback and moisture vaporator, are fantastic little features that let you spread the four elements out and make quite a complete seeming scene.<br />
(<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">For what it&#39;s worth&nbsp;</span>I&#39;ve got a small sand vignette with four sandtroopers on, the escape pod and the last landspeeder on one narrow shelf, and they look great with the Dewback added; the other elements look great all together on the next shelf with the Landspeeders&nbsp;leaving one shelf and entering the next to tie them together visually.)</p>

<p>And the main feature of the set, the cantina, I think is very impressive indeed. With the hinges and sliding sections you can have it as an almost coherent and contained building, and it can open out freely. The sliding floor under Han and Greedo&#39;s table and the band area mean the opened out scene can be accessed nicely for play.<br />
This part has plenty of potential for free play, and will let you act out just about every scene from the film from entering Mos Eisley to boarding the Falcon, droids behind the door included. It can be arranged in just about any way for display too, I&#39;ve reversed the build of the door to have it forming a sort of front with the rest of the building half opened and the innards half slid.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As you may have gathered I really like this set, and I think the four elements come off particularly well against the usual Star Wars ship-in-a-box. It looks good, can be displayed well, and should provide plenty of fun if you actually want to play with it! (Lego&#39;s for children? Surely not! :P)</p>

<p>The drawbacks are very small, I can&#39;t think of anything beyond little niggly&nbsp;points where I preferred the previous Landspeeder to this one and those are neither here nor there really.<br />
The biggest issue that I&#39;ve seen others mention is the minifigure selection and perhaps we could and should have had one fewer Bith for the sake of the bartender, or just added an extra figure to keep the band feeling substantial. But Greedo is great and an important character, the other figures are all good inclusions, the only way to have done better here would have made this a &pound;100+&nbsp;figure-fest so I don&#39;t think TLG&nbsp;can be criticised&nbsp;on that.</p>

"jackflash49","2014-09-28T05:29:21.027Z","An Outstanding Lego Star Wars Set","<p>I own almost all the Lego Architecture Sets, some City sets, including the Coast Guard Patrol and Cargo Terminal sets. I also have the new Millenium Falcon.</p>

<p>This set was boxed in the usual good Lego box. There were two instruction booklets, and the parts were packed in separate groups, numbered from 1 to 5. All of the parts of this set fit each other perfectly, as have all my previous Lego sets. One point that I must make is that I have never opened a Lego set that did not include all the pieces, as well as extra pieces that seem to be included because they might be easily lost by young builders who play with the sets.</p>

<p>The mini-figs included in this set include all the characters that were in the Mos Eisley Cantina scene in the original Star Wars movie, which I saw on the first day of its release. The only missing figures were R2-D2 and C-3PO, but their kind weren&#39;t allowed in the cantina. The Dewback is outstanding. Luke&#39;s landspeeder build was fun and full of memories for me.</p>

<p>Building this set was not difficult, but the build required attention to details and my previous building skills were helpful, as usual. I believe the 8 to 14 year old age group indicated on the box is appropriate. I love the slide out rooms of the Bith musicians and of the Han Solo-Greedo confrontation are great. I also love the hinged rooms.</p>

<p>I really like the completed model and highly recommend it to all Star Wars Lego lovers, as well as Lego lovers in general.</p>

<p>The price of this set is very good, especially considering the mini-figs that were included.</p>

"Duq","2015-01-24T11:33:07.633Z","Two steps forward, one step back","<p>One of my first Star Wars sets was #7110, the first Landspeeder back in 1999. I&#39;ve got the 2010 Landspeeder but I missed out on the first Mos Eisley set so when this set was announced I knew I&#39;d have to buy it straight away. Did it live up to the expectation?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is fairly big but is stuffed full of bags. Unfortunately in my box that meant it was so full the instruction books came out badly crumpled.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As is obvious from the images, there&#39;s a wide variety of tan in this set; bricks, arches, slopes and of course that dome. There is brown and dark tan for accents and dark red in the speeder. The guns in this set are the old type, not the new stud-shooters.</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s few plates in nougat for the body of the speeder. Until now this colour had only been used for heads and pigs so this is quite a departure. Let&#39;s see what other parts are going to be released in this colour.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Of course some of the usual suspects are here; Han Solo and Greebo for the famous shooting under the table scene, the Bith band, although it only has 3 members and Luke and Obi Wan and finally there&#39;s a Storm trooper.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a few strange omissions; R2D2 and C3PO are not included in this set although you&#39;d expect them on the back of the speeder and equally strange: there is no bartender.</p>

<p>All of which made me wonder which scenes this set is actually meant to depict. If it&#39;s the arrival in Mos Eisley then the droids should be there. If it&#39;s the action inside the cantina after the droids have gone into hiding then what&#39;s with the speeder and the Dewback?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building starts with the saddle for the Dewback which takes only seconds to put together. Next up is the famous landspeeder. It&#39;s an interesting build, unless you already have #8092; the design is 90% identical.</p>

<p>The cantina is fun to build; it&#39;s full of play features and fun details. After building the central structure you add section after section.</p>

<p>The build is not very challenging. The trickiest part in my opinion are the stickers that wrap around the egines; they are not easy to get on straight</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the cantina. Obviously it&#39;s not a full building, it&#39;s more like a movie set. It looks really good; the colour scheme works well and the shapes are well done. The way the trough pushes the band and Greebo&#39;s table out after you open up the building is very clever. The roof also hinges up for access. The bar looks great with the large macaroni&#39;s and the gun beside the cash register.</p>

<p>Yes, the band and their stage should be bigger but so does the whole cantina. At the size it is this is a well built scene. The only real criticism is the missing bartender. This is definitely a big step forward.</p>

<p>The Landspeeder has made two steps forward from #7110 to #4501 and then #8092. This version to me is a step back. The design hasn&#39;t changed much but where it has it&#39;s made it worse. The nougat colour looks good but I really don&#39;t like the reliance on stickers. In the previous version different jet engine parts were used to represent the knackered left engine. Here all the engines are the same except for sticker. In the previous model there were grille tiles in front of the windscreen and at the back to suggest the power circuit access and here again that&#39;s been replaced by stickers. All those stickers show finer detail but make it less of a Lego interpretation.</p>

<p>Finally there&#39;s the Dewback. They didn&#39;t feature in the original movie (there were CGI&#39;d in for the 1997 Special Edition) so for me it could have been left out of this set. I&#39;m also not a fan of these big animals like the dino&#39;s and dragons. They just don&#39;t &#39;look Lego&#39; to me. I would rather have seen R2D2, C3PO, the bartender and another sand trooper.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Like many sets it&#39;s a bit of a mixed bag. For many this set will be a must-have for Greebo, the Bith and the Dewback. The cantina is great and the speeder is not bad, just not as good as its predecessor. It&#39;s a decent set, but it could have been a lot better.</p>

<p>I have to mention the price. I bought this set in a sale and I wouldn&#39;t have bought it at full price. For 615 pieces the European price of &euro;80 is a joke. I know there&#39;s different price for different markets and all that, but at the current rate that&#39;s $90. The US price is $70.</p>

<p>So great models, great parts, great playability. Building experience let down a bit by the speeder being so similar to the previous one. And really low marks for value for money.</p>

"sudorum","2014-12-31T05:27:50.683Z","Four Cupboards are Better Than One","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original Mos Eisley cantina released in 2004&nbsp;is a classic example of a&nbsp;&quot;Buy it for the Minifigure&quot;&nbsp;set. Really the only positive thing&nbsp;it has going for it is the Greedo&nbsp;minifigure and the Dewback.&nbsp;The cantina isn&#39;t exactly awe inspiring in its detail or accuracy--it&#39;s just a room. More of a cupboard, actually.&nbsp;That being said,&nbsp;I&#39;m rather surprised it took this long for Lego to finally upgrade a set that was in greater&nbsp;need of an update than the AT-AT or Millenium Falcon or whatever other superfluous remake Lego has released recently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, the new&nbsp;Mos Eisley&nbsp;Cantina&nbsp;is an immediate improvement despite the fact that it closely resembles its predecessor.&nbsp;Like the original, the new set&nbsp;comes with a landspeeder, a Dewback with mounted storm trooper, and a cantina that is a bit... under&nbsp;whelming. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the cantina itself is a whole lot better than the original. But that doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be improved, because it definitely can be. The bar with fountain is a nice touch, but it&#39;s a bit small and there&#39;s not a bartender. The next room is comparatively&nbsp;empty, but that&#39;s a necessity&nbsp;because the Bith musicians couldn&#39;t fit anywhere if it was cluttered with items. The adjoining room has a booth seating arrangement&nbsp;where Han and Greedo&nbsp;exchange pleasantries. These two rooms can extend from the main building by pushing in a Dewback&nbsp;feeding trough that sits outside.&nbsp;I assume this sliding&nbsp;function is here to allow easier access to the minifigures. The final room is fitted with a dome on the top, and the inside is decorated with two chairs and a device of some kind. I don&#39;t know what this device is, I can only say it has a decal on it (which isn&#39;t saying much).&nbsp;A sliding door is connected to the domed room and can swing out&nbsp;by a hinge piece. All of the rooms are actually connected by hinge pieces, which means the building can be displayed with the rooms facing outward or closed together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the minifigure department, we have updated&nbsp;characters like Luke, Han, and Old Ben, while the&nbsp;Bith musicians are completely new. I thought Greedo would be the highlight of the set, but it&#39;s the musicians who take the top prize. I&#39;m really glad Lego made a new Greedo, but I&#39;m disappointed that the original minifigure is in some ways superior. Now I&#39;m fairly certain&nbsp;that&nbsp;the original minifig doesn&#39;t have printing on his back like the new one has, but what the original&nbsp;does have are arms that emphasize&nbsp;the texture of his shirt. The new Greedo minifigure&nbsp;inexplicably neglects&nbsp;this detail. There&#39;s also the little fact that both characters are colored differently. The new Greedo is more of an olive green color, whereas the original is an aqua green shade. It&#39;s difficult to determine which color&nbsp;is more movie accurate, so I&#39;ll just leave it at that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This&nbsp;landspeeder is the fourth version Lego has released. It&#39;s almost exactly like the 2010 version, only this time Lego remembered to color it accurately. The new&nbsp;salmon color is about as close Lego has come to capturing the vehicle&#39;s light pink complexion. A plate in the back of the speeder&nbsp;can be removed to access a storage space that is large enough to hold a disassembled lightsaber blade and hilt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though I&#39;m satisfied with this rendition of the cantina, I&#39;m hoping that some day Lego will make a version that fully encapsulates the building&#39;s size and scope. This is a decent set to depict the basic setup of the cantina, but it&#39;s a bit impressionistic, if you know what I mean.&nbsp;Due to the dissimilarities between the two Greedos, I think it&#39;s worth buying the old set online somewhere to compare the two or just add to your&nbsp;Rodian&nbsp;minigifure collection.&nbsp;</p>

Also I think that the set is worth the money. The set really brings back old memories of watching the movies, and getting the Cantina Band song out of my head.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very wide, yet not very deep.The&nbsp;set comes with 2 medium sized instruction booklets. The front&nbsp;of the box has some very nice cover art.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>If anything can be more unique about this set it has to be its parts. The parts are very detailed and interesting. There are many different parts to&nbsp;this set and most of them are really cool, and normally unseen. Such as the bars that go around the Bar&nbsp;part of the cantina, and also the bars that go around the front of Luke&#39;s Landspeeder. Even though there are a lot of stickers on the Landspeeder the parts are very good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>?For the price of the set there are a lot of hard to find minifigures. Such as Greedo, The Cantina Band, Sandtroopers, and the Dewback.?&nbsp;They all have nice printing to them. The only thing that I would comment on is Luke&#39;s new overly&nbsp;detailed face, it just doesn&#39;t look right.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was a pretty easy one. I think that the age recommendation on this set is very good. The parts are very cool to start with, and when you put great&nbsp;parts with a great build, than you get a great set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I think the completed model of the Mos Eisley Cantina is very accurate. It&#39;s folding feature is very cool, and so are the slide out parts are very cool, and interesting. The minifigures are great, and so are the hidden features. Also the details are very accurate. Overall the set is a good one!</p>

<p>The box was thinner than I would have expected but as long as sets this size usually have. 2 instructions booklets were used.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of tan pieces... arches, &quot;macaroni&quot; bricks, and textured wavy bricks. Great &quot;flesh&quot;&nbsp;coloured bricks on Luke&#39;s Landspeeder&nbsp;and 3 flexible grey tubes are used, 2 around the Landspeeder and 1&nbsp;curving around the front of the bar.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are some pretty sweet&nbsp;minifigures in this set. For one, Greedo, with his brightly coloured&nbsp;and textured head; he definitely sticks out of the crowd and is great to have in your collection. Also the Bith Musicians, I love their head sculpts so much and the fact they also have instruments to play makes it even better. Though I do wish that we got all of&nbsp;<span dir=""auto"">Figrin D&#39;an and the Modal Nodes it doesn&#39;t take away from the set because you could just buy more Bith Musicians. Han Solo is business as usual because we&#39;ve seen him before. Luke has new face printing with lots of lines and creases which is kind of meh. Ben Kenobi&nbsp;looks nice in his simplistic Jedi robes and the Sandtrooper&nbsp;is actually very nice. I really like him and he looks great on the back of his Dewback.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>My favourite part of the build was the Landspeeder but is was overall a pretty interesting build. Lots of building up the walls but was still alright and the little system to push out the rooms by moving the Dewback&#39;s&nbsp;food dish is cool.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Because the Mos Eisley Cantina is such a iconic part of Star Wars, I kind of feel like this is a set you just need to have. Yes, it&#39;s not perfect, but all the elements are still there to some capacity and the Dewback&nbsp;and Landspeeder are nice to have to fill out the scene. Overall, I like this set and its minifigures and would give it an 8/10.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-11-11T07:47:58.963Z","Everything you need at a very reasonable price","<p>Tatooine is no doubt one of if not the most famous planets in Star Wars as it appears in episodes 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9, not to mention it was part of Rebels and is becoming a very large part of the Mandalorian. I would also think it would be a very safe assumption that the upcoming Obiwan series will also take place entirely on Tatooine. However, surprisingly this locale has not really gotten the attention it deserves from Lego, with many of the sets based here being unavailable for many years and now extremely expensive. Mos Eisley is of course the very first city we saw and the cantina is of course where Luke and Obiwan meet Han and Chewie. The cantina also has been featured in both seasons of the Mandalorian which has been a lot of fun to see.</p>

<p>However the new UCS set, while it looks amazing, costs an incredible $350! Luckily there have been three other renditions of the cantina to choose from. The sets from 2004 and 2018 both are fairly small, and really only gives you a place to order drinks and kill Greedo. This set from 2014 is much more substantial and if you shop around can still be had for around $60, its original price, and an absolute bargain considering what you get with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>8 minifigures are included with this set which is an incredible amount given the sets size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You of course get Luke and Obiwan, both of whom look great. They both feature detailed torso and leg prints.&nbsp;I do have a slight problem with Luke&#39;s head as it has some lines to give his face more contour, and I feel as if they make him look older, where in this set he should really look very young.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up is Han and Greedo. Han is fairly standard as he always is, but still looks great. Greedo of course is probably the most exciting figure in the set and his head mold looks fantastic. They both carry small blasters which can conveniently be concealed under a table, although unfortunately not a Lego built table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You then get 3 Bith musicians, two of whom have unique instruments, while the third plays the drums. While their torsos are fairly plain, they are accurate. However, it is the wonderful head molds that make them look amazing. The fact you get 3 allows for an actual band, so thank you Lego for being so generous with them!</p>

<p>Finally the set is rounded out with a sand trooper all decked out and riding a custom dewback. While the sand trooper is highly detailed, the dewback is the main attraction. It features a 4x4 studded area on top which can be covered with either 4 arches which are included to give a smooth unadorned animal, or with a brick built harness to carry the sand trooper. The dewback itself is huge and has an operable jaw, although nothing else on the animal moves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The set features a wonderful selection of parts in colors you wouldn&#39;t normally expect from Star Wars. The speeder gives you some beautiful bright orange bricks, while the cantina features lots of tan including arches and a large dome which is what defines Tatooine architecture. Not to mention you get lots of those lightsaber like bricks that are sideways on one end in a variety of colors which is fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>You start out by building Luke&#39;s speeder. If you&#39;ve ever built one before (I have the one from 2010) then you already know what you&#39;re doing. However it is still a fun little build. If this is your first time building a speeder, you will be pleasantly surprised by how tubes are used to represent the grill.</p>

<p>Next is a small moisture evaporator that has an interesting technic based construction and looks very nice. Once the model is completed it can also be attached to the cantina for easy storage.</p>

<p>After that you build the cantina which is not surprisingly assembled section by section. You start with the two rooms that are side by side, one of which houses the Bith musicians, and the other which seats Han and Greedo. Interestingly neither room has a floor as you build out the walls and roof. Once the structure is completed you build each floor separately along with a trough for the dewback to eat a bone from on the outside of the building. The trough is a fair distance away from the cantinas exterior wall and gets connected to either floor by two long technic axels. The purpose for this is rather ingenious, you can slide in the trough and the two rooms get pushed out of the structure so you can easily put in or take out minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up you build the bar which is a fun detailed hold and looks great. My only complaint is that the drink machines do not use IG heads as I think it would have been great if Lego exploited the fact that IG-88 was assembled from leftover cantina parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally you build one additional, fairly large room that gives you enough space for Luke, Obiwan, Han, and Chewie (BYOC) to talk. Additionally you build a sliding door that can be used to enter the cantina from the outside, although I feel like the hinges were placed on the wrong side.</p>

<p>The Model&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the model looks fantastic. I especially love how it folds up allowing for it to look like a complete building from the outside as well as making it easy to store. It is also very sturdy for a model with lots of hinges and moving floors. The 8 minifigures give you plenty to play with. While Chewie is missing, you no doubt have plenty of him that can easily be added. As for R2 and 3PO, they don&#39;t serve their kind. Wuher would have been a nice inclusion as there is room for him behind the bar, so I&#39;ll have to purchase one on Bricklink, but I really can&#39;t complain given how much you get with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, what really makes this set great is its attention to detail. Not only is the bar elaborate, but the walls have excellent color patterns, and the sconces look great. Not to mention I really like the look of the speeder. The oranges look great, and the busted engine is noticeable yet subtle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>If your like me and don&#39;t want to spend $350 on a cantina, this set is definitely the way to go. It also will fit in very well with other Tatooine based sets as it is at a normal Lego scale. Placing the new Obiwan&#39;s hut set beside it definitely works very well, as do many of the moisture evaporators that have been included in other sets. I recommend being patient to get a good price, but this is definitely the set you are looking for.&nbsp;</p>

I hope they re-make this set someday and scale it up to 2-3 times the size. I&#39;ve seen a few custom Mos Eisley sets that are phenomenal and LEGO artists could draw inspiration from.&nbsp;</p>

"Skeletonwizard8","2020-08-25T20:09:02.347Z","(Second) Best cantina Lego has ever made!","<p>This is a great set. The landspeeder (we have enough, Lego) is a great build, love the flexible prices being used on the sides of the front part instead of stickers. The main build is much more substantial than the newer cantina, with four separate areas: a bar, two seats for Greedo and Han to shoot each other, a room for the musicians and a cool little entry room. The entire cantina can be folded into itself for easier display.</p>

<p>The Minifigs</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Overall plenty of good minifigs come in this set. You get Kenobi, Luke, Greedo (which is exclusive to this set), Han Solo, a Sandtrooper, the Dewback, as well as three Bith&nbsp;musicians. Too bad they weren&#39;t able to get all band members in, but I don&#39;t think many would be happy with hundreds of Bith musicians anyway. The dewback is a great animal. It has a saddle for the sandtrooper to sit on and it gives you some 1x4 olive green arch pieces if you want to have the dewback as a natural animal.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also get a moisture vaporator&nbsp;with the set, pretty clever build for that. On the back of the cantina there is a little water trough which, if you push in, will push the seats and the stage for the musicians forward for easier access.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Edit: The new cantina came out which surpasses this one in every way shape and form, not the best anymore</p>
