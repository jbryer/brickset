"Tar_Domo","2014-08-31T10:15:37.267Z","REBELS Set And a Really Good One","<p>This is my first Rebels set and my 3rd review overall.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong> The box was quite small and there was this REBELS Stormtrooper logo. The instructions were easy to follow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts </strong>In the ship there is not a lot exclusive parts. The spring-loaded shooter was the most interesting one though we know that also from earlier 2014 sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures </strong>This set comes with two minifigures. Ezra Bridger comes with hair piece and helmet. Ezra has some nice details. Chopper (the astromech) is not the basic model of astromechs. It is smaller than R2-D2 and other astromechs. It has nice details and is a nice add to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The build </strong>The building was quite easy. I think I made just one mistake and the whole building took less than 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong> The best thing in the completed model are the wings. I founded at least 4 different ways how you can put them. This makes also the playability better. In the ship is also a spot for Chopper and an other for&nbsp;Ezra&acute;s gun and helmet. One little problem with the ship are the black laser cannons. They don&acute;t hold on their spots and are dropping very easily.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion </strong>This is a good Rebels set that has good playability and goes also as a display model. You can combine this to the main ship The Ghost, but I don&acute;t have The Ghost yet, so I don&acute;t know how that happens. I recommend this set to SW collectors, mostly to Expanded Universe collectors.</p>

<p>The Box is pretty basic, it has kind of a good idea of the playability of the set. The instructions are specific which is good!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s good that you get Ezra and Chopper in this set! i think Ezra could have a different alternate face, The helmet looks like a cool thing in the set too, Chopper is cool and well detailed!</p>

"aredotam","2014-10-14T23:39:24.643Z","A Small But Good Step Into a New Star Wars Series","<p>The Phantom is the smaller of the first two Star Wars LEGO sets made for the new cartoon series Rebels. Small and unremarkable for the most part, the Phantom is a really fun ship to have in your collection.</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>Cockpit: The Phantom is a small ship but the cockpit is easily accessible, which gives it a lot of playability. The pilot, Ezra Bridger, fits in easily and doesn&rsquo;t need to have his arms in an odd position just to close the canopy. The minifigure does have to lean back slightly, especially with the helmet on, but it&rsquo;s not so much that it looks like the pilot is taking a nap.</p>

<p>Storage: The top panel on the back of the Phantom comes off to reveal an area to house the astromech droid C1-10P. It&rsquo;s a snug fit, but keeps the droid from rattling around. At the very back between the engines is another spot to store a helmet or hair piece and a small blaster.</p>

<p>Minifigures: Ezra Bridger and C1-10P (aka Chopper) come with the Phantom. Both are great replicas of their on-screen counterparts. Ezra comes with a black hair piece and a new Imperial trooper helmet that can be switched around.</p>

<p>Docks with the Ghost: The best feature is that the Phantom docks with the larger current Star Wars Rebels set The Ghost. I didn&rsquo;t know this when I went to buy The Ghost (I have reviewed that as well) but I went ahead and bought this set. The Phantom&rsquo;s wings fold up against the hull so it can settle between the main engines of The Ghost. I made a few slight changes to the hull of the Phantom to make docking easier. All in all, I love this feature.</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>Forward Cannons: The Phantom&rsquo;s long front blasters make it look tough but are flimsy. They haven&rsquo;t come off my set yet, but I have a feeling that they could get snagged and pop off. I would also have liked different pieces for the tips &ndash; maybe red or yellow translucent bottles.</p>

<p>Spring-Loaded Shooter: It seems like Lego has moved away from its flick-missiles to these new spring-loaded weapons. On one hand they&rsquo;re much easier to fire and can send their missiles faster and farther. However, if you wanted to keep these new missiles loaded it&rsquo;s very easy to fire them accidently. This is especially the case with the top-mounted launcher on the Phantom. I rarely load the missile into it.</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>This is a fun, small set, with well-done minifigures, and I would recommend it to any Star Wars fan. If you&rsquo;ve already spent the $90 on The Ghost, definitely spring for this set at $25. They really complete one another, and give you almost all of main characters from the new Rebels cartoon series.</p>

"brickman3","2015-05-03T15:47:52.123Z","Prepare to Detach!","<p>?This set is a basic, yet awesome build. It isn&#39;t big, but it can do big things! Let&#39;s get a quick overview of the characters, and then we&#39;ll do the pros and cons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ezra Bridger:&nbsp;</strong>Ezra is a padawan (a Jedi in training) of master Kanan&nbsp;Janus. In this set, he is the captain of the Phantom, and comes with a pistol, a cool helmet, and his hair. Nothing exciting, but somewhat&nbsp;rare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>C1-10P (Chopper): </strong>Chopper is a nut in the series, but today he is the co-pilot of the Phantom.&nbsp;He is smaller than most&nbsp;Astromech&nbsp;droids, but he is still a quick thinker. He is made of 5 pieces instead of 4, and is still as flexible. Well played buddy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, here we go. I will admit, this set has a decent list!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Connects with set 75053-1: The Ghost</li>
	<li>Spring-loaded Shooter</li>
	<li>Foldable Wings</li>
	<li>Eject Function</li>

	<li>Chopper</li>
	<li>Storage Unit</li>
	<li>Chopper Hatch (Open the top of the backside)</li>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Hatch often breaks</li>
	<li>No Sabine</li>
	<li>No Lightsaber</li>

"davy_jones","2020-09-20T12:14:28.633Z","Corellian Celebutante","<p>&nbsp;Star Wars Rebels featured wonderful new characters, interesting locales and that staple of the Star Wars universe - spacecrafts. The show managed to be engaging without relying too much on the films. It was therefore perfectly justifiable for Lego to create a line based on the show. Set 75048 &mdash; The Phantom is the Lego version of a craft that plays quite a significant role in several episodes throughout the series&#39; run. The box contains two bags, one instruction manual and one sticker sheet. The build is straightforward, however the finished starfighter is chock-full of features. Since the actual design is blocky, this translates well into a Lego version. The final build is also quite sturdy.</p>

<p>The first bag contains pieces to Ezra and C1-10P (Chopper) minifigs and the aft section of the craft. The Ezra minifig has basic detailing which is similar to his season 1 appearance. This is apt since he starts out as an orphaned street rat. Perhaps the character with the most personality in the series, the droid Chopper can be considered an astromech with attitude. In fact, just the inclusion of Chopper in this set with Ezra can inspire enough creative themes for play although the baddies are missing. For example, Chopper&#39;s reluctance to follow orders, or Chopper&#39;s wilful decisions which lead to technical issues and the list goes on. As seen in the animated version, the front section is equipped with forward laser cannons. The Phantom is actually quite heavily armed for it&#39;s size and these laser cannons are important to emphasise that. The cannons are also housed within pieces that resemble the magnetic flashback suppressors of the craft. The cockpit&#39;s shape is generally trapezoidal and is actually very similar &mdash; once again &mdash; to the real thing. Below the cockpit, stickers are provided for the sando aqua monster logo on both sides.</p>

<p>The second bag contains pieces to make the rear section. The rear dorsal laser turret is modified slightly into a Lego shooter but I suspect this is to serve the playability aspect. One who was watched the series will know that the craft has foldable wings that wrap around the body and cargo compartment. Once again, the initial blocky shape has lent itself well to the Lego form. When the wings are unfolded, the exposed cargo hold shows features which are quite similar to the actual craft. There is an opening at the rear, between the engines which can be useful to store Ezra&#39;s training helmet. The only drawback is that, in the series the Phantom is able to dock on to the Ghost in both directions; forward or rearward. In the Lego version however it only docks rearwards, i.e. engine side into the space provided in the Ghost ship.</p>

<p>Overall the build is quite simple as it&#39;s targeted towards the 7-12 age category. However, the final build is robust, looks quite accurate and has several features to increase playability. Above all however, the charm of this set is due to the significant role that the Phantom plays in the series. Whether it&#39;s being used as a transport ship, decoy to help the Ghost or upgraded with Quarrie&#39;s hyperdrive, the set helps to relive those memorable moments. A must-have for Rebels fans.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:39:36.087Z","Initial Offiering Slightly Disappointing.","<p><strong>Set #75048 The Phantom:</strong> When Rebels was introduced for the first year there were two sets, The Ghost and The Phantom, both capable of interacting with one another. That being said The Phantom is a bit of a disappointing set despite being a solid model and that is mostly due to the number of Minifigures included. Read this review to get my thoughts on all facets of this initial offering from the Rebel Sub-Theme.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: This new box design for the Rebels sub-theme is pretty impressive. It stands out compared to other Star Wars boxes, and the colouring is a nice change with some orange resembling the paintwork Sabine favors for her art. The use of grey is also a nice change from all the black and dark blues we&rsquo;ve seen in the past.</p>

<p>Instructions: The instructions break up the build between the two numbered bags. So each section is rather short, meaning that you won&rsquo;t find any tricky parts. The back page has a shot of all the other Star Wars sets released in this wave, but there are no Minifigure checklists in this one.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts in this set are fairly standard, I think the biggest draw for parts in this set are the unprinted black Astromech heads and the cockpit, the rest are your standard bricks, plats and studs.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Ezra Bridger: The main protagonist of Rebels, Ezra has some nicely detailed printing in Minifigure form. He includes a double-sided torso with his customary outfit, some leg printing and a double-sided face with regular and concerned expressions. His accessories include a Cadet Trooper helmet, a small blaster pistol and his standard hair piece, which appears to be a black version of one that originated during the era of Lord of the Rings, I believe it&rsquo;s Boromir&rsquo;s hair.</p>

<p>C1-10P Chopper: A compacted Astromech design, Chopper is loaded with personality in LEGO form, he doesn&rsquo;t include any of his gadgets or other manipulator arms, however the printing on his head and torso are very impressive and I am a fan of any Astromechs that don&rsquo;t rely on a simple R2 parts re-use with different printing. The build for this droid is excellent and fun.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1 Cockpit: Separating such a small set into two numbered bags means that the build will be short and sweet. Easy to follow with something that might annoy quite a few people unfortunately, the cockpit controls are just a sticker. That&rsquo;s right no printed detailing for a cockpit control panel, talk about unfortunate. The cockpit window is at least a printed piece.</p>

<p>Bag 2 Rear Section &amp; Wings: The design of the Phantom is rather different, it has a few resemblances to the Imperial Shuttle, albeit much compacted. So when building it in sections you&rsquo;re basically building a compacted box shape, almost a cargo container with wings. The build can be repetitive however it&rsquo;s still a fun little build and won&rsquo;t take up a lot of time. Stickers for detail are in abundance here as well, so be prepared.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Once combined the ship is a nice fun little model, much less awkward looking compared to The Ghost, this little one-man fighter is loads of fun and has great personality. The wings can fold down, there is a small compartment in the back for storing Ezra&rsquo;s blaster and spare head piece. The rear section can lift off easily to reveal a slot for Chopper to fit in, and the missile launcher can be used to shoot down enemy fighters.</p>

<p>This model is just awesome fun to play with, despite having limited play features, it includes a few too many stickers for my tastes, since I&rsquo;m more used to cockpit controls being printed elements from as far back as Classic Space sets. Overall though a great model.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Star Wars Rebels replaces Clone Wars as the newest animated based sub-theme of Star Wars, while some Clone Wars sets continue to be made Rebels has the next big push. Of course with Force Awakens coming into the picture Rebels will be only featured in sets for a finite time, and these sets do not disappoint. Some of the designs, such as The Ghost, strike me as a tad unorthodox looking and somewhat ungainly, however they really stand out.</p>

<p>I recommend this set for completists, however some might want to skip it in favor for the Ghost and other sets to get the Minifigures here since they aren&rsquo;t unique.</p>

"Cold_fuzion","2015-05-25T18:11:25.857Z","Diving back into Star Wars with the Phantom","<p>I had pretty much sworn off Star Wars sets in favor of Super Heroes and modulars (only so much money to go around). Then I finally got suckered into watching Rebels and I was hooked. Next thing I know I&#39;ve got The Ghost, Phantom &amp; Ezra&#39;s speeder in a cart (hooray for price matching).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a box. I&#39;m not a box-keeper and really don&#39;t care about them.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear and easy enough to follow, but I did somehow end up with some extra parts at the end that I do not think were supposed to be extras (more on that in the build section).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of slopes and little, mostly white pieces. The cockpit glass is terrific and I loved the yellow 6079693s. There where a couple parts I really whish could have been printed instead of stickers, but I tend to loathe stickers anyway. Over nothing too exciting here.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Ezra Bridger and Chopper. While I was excited to get these two they really fell a bit short of capturing the characters. Chopper is too clean. In the show he clearly has a lot of wear, tear and dirt while the minifig&nbsp;is showroom clean. Ezra is harder to pin down, but I think it would have helped considerably if his hair had a more bluish tint to it. The addition of the helmet is awesome, but I&#39;m a little less clear on the blaster. I don&#39;t recall him ever actually using a blaster in the show.</p>

<p>Meh. They&#39;re quality figures and will do the job of conveying the characters even if they don&#39;t quite live up to my original hopes.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was a fast build. Like I did it at work on my lunch in about 20 minutes fast. The ship is built of a lot of small parts. There aren&#39;t a lot of clever connections or new ideas and that&#39;s okay, not every set needs to make you scratch your head at some new building technique. What this build may lack in excitement it makes up for in speed.</p>

<p>I will note that somehow I ended up with two extra 2x8s and some slopes that don&#39;t strike me as the usual spare parts one expects to find at the end of a new build. As the model seems to be just fine without them I&#39;m not really worried about it either (even if I can&#39;t figure out at all where they belong). I&#39;ll see how this affects docking with the Ghost, but I don&#39;t expect it to be a problem.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The end result is a pretty nice, little shuttle. There aren&#39;t a lot of play features, but it&#39;s right on part with what you should expect from a ~$20 set. The wings fold neatly and do a wonderful job of &nbsp;capturing the shape of the ship when folded up. Very shoowshable and kid-friendly (even&nbsp;large 39 year-old kids, too). I have no complaints at all about the final product.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While I do have a couple minor gripes or questions about some of the choices made, I can&#39;t argue with the end result. If you are a fan of Star Wars in general or Rebels specifically, you really do need to pick this up before it vanishes into hyperspace.</p>

"JW_2187","2018-11-04T21:57:52.117Z","75048 The Phantom.","<p>Released in 2014 for just &pound;19.99 with 234 pieces this model is the first, and to this date only, minifigure scale rendition of this version of the shuttle, the Phantom from the Star Wars Rebels TV series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ship itself splits into 2 sections in the middle and this acts well as a play feature, representing an escape pod, however in the show there is no evidence of this happening. However the connecting section on the back of the cockpit has a garish yellow brick with technic holes to hold the pins on the end of the back section. The windscreen is appropriate and looks similar enough to the reference material. The cab can hold 1 figure, and 1 is included in the set. The interior is reasonably detailed and has a console and control yolk on a sticker. The lasers are simple but line up well with the real ship, however have no firing function.</p>

<p>The folded wings in the back section at the appropriate angle as well as being able to fold in compactly, hence also fits in the ghost well. However, when these wings are opened out they have detailing in the form of curves and a grille and tile which create a much smoother look for the model. However, having the wings opened does show the slight hollowness of the interior as there are 2 1x1 plate sized gap which views into the cargo bay at the back and into the droid compartment at the front. When the ship is in the ghost and if the wings are up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The droid compartment can hold the shorter astromech droid which is used for Chopper/C1-10P, however can&#39;t hold a minifigure when not taken apart or another, larger astromech droid. The rear storage compartment is also more than sufficient for ezra&#39;s blaster and either hair or helmet as he will only have one on at a time. The top has a spring loaded missile shooter on top which represents the rotary cannon array, which sits atop the phantom in the show. This seems to be a sufficient swap as, while it provides a rather drastic change, as it doesn&#39;t look sloppy, other than the trailing trans-red missile. The sticker in front of the launcher is a brilliant detail, and shows real care taken by the designers, as it could have very easily been left off and could only be improved if it was a print.</p>

<p>Both figures included in the set; Chopper and Ezra Bridger are appropriate for a set of this size and price. The Chopper figure was very rare when the set came out only appearing in this and the Comic Con exclusive ghost until the combat frigate 75158 2 years later. The detailing on the droid&#39;s torso and head parts is very intricate and accurate, and the body is rounded off well with the 2x2 inverted radar dish on the bottom. The legs are also new to the Chopper figure and look considerably better than the standard mold for a droid of this size. The Ezra Bridger figure is also quite rare and is the only one to date with his helmet included (he comes in 2 other sets without it). The prints are intricate and go onto the back as and look great, especially on he legs and hips. The helmet is well detailed and shows off the print almost perfectly, as well as using the right mold for his hair. The double sided head works well and shows both confidence and uncertainty and can be used in a variety of situations.</p>

<p>This set has recently increased in price on the second hand market having reached what I would say is the lowest point it will ever reach in the foreseeable future. Overall, I would say that this is a great set which displays both design and playability and is a solid 5 stars.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2022-03-14T16:39:09.59Z","Great connecting set for Ghost","<p>This set came with Chopper and Ezra who were both members of the Ghost crew that were missing from the Ghost set, so it was good to get them in the connecting set. The coolest part of this set is how it attaches to the Ghost ship at the back. The way the wings fold down and lock into place is very satisfying and the detail along the body of the ship when the wings are down is good. The front of the ship with the cockpit can detach which it is unable to do in the show but is a cool play feature. In the show you can fit a lot of people in the back part of the phantom while here you can only fit Chopper, but that is acceptable&nbsp;because of scaling reasons. The spring-loaded shooter on topics good for playability but does not look very good, but you can remove it and put the white tile on top if you want which makes it look much better. Overall this is a decent set when paired with the Ghost and connected to that set.</p>
