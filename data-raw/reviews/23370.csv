<p>Since the last version back in 2004, Snowspeeders have been released as part of sets #8089-1 Hoth&nbsp;Wampa Cave and #75014-1 Battle Of Hoth and for this review I will be using the Wampa Cave Snowspeeder as a comparison as that is my favorite version of this ship to date. Now lets get on with the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Box is a good size for the &pound;35 set but is around half the size of the &pound;40 Battle Of&nbsp;Hoth set, box artwork is nice and shows the Snowspeeder&nbsp;skimming over the frozen ice fields of Hoth while a Snowtrooper with mobile gun emplacement tries in vain to shoot down the speeder. Usual Darth Vader dark blue band on top of the box and new &quot; Spring Loaded Shooter Included&quot; logo in the bottom right of the box. &nbsp;Rear of the box shows the set in action and all its functions and a nice diagram of the speeder with front, side and plan views of it.</p>

<p>Instructions are around A5 size and are 57 pages long, artwork on the front is the same as the box as you would expect and the last page depicts all the new summer 2014 mini figures and lists the set numbers they can be found in.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts come in 3 bags and you also get a small sticker sheet. &nbsp;Bag 1 is the Snowspeeder main body, the Imperial Mobile Gun Emplacement and also Luke Skywalker, Bag 2 and 3 are the Snowspeeder wings, a Snowtrooper&nbsp;and also Dak Ralter. &nbsp;I can not be 100% certain but it does not look like any new parts are in this set with the exception of the spring loaded shooter parts that seem of feature in a few of the 2014 sets. It is a mix of white and grey bricks and does not look all that updated from the Wampa Cave speeder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three mini figures are included with this set, 2 Rebel and 1 Imperial, will start with the good guys. &nbsp;First up is of course Luke Skywalker in his flight suit, at first glance he does look very similar to his X-Wing flight suit but his hands are white and not black like the X-Wing suit, the printing is much more detailed with leg pockets, printing on the waist band/belt area, the life support pack on the chest is larger and more detailed and even the padding behind the pack has more shape to it. &nbsp;The helmet is detailed but slightly less so than the X-Wing version but Luke&#39;s face is double sided to show either orange visor up or down and the visor itself is more detailed showing the actual frame of the visor, improved from the simple orange band of previous figures. Luke is armed with his lightsaber&nbsp;in blue and silver hilt. After checking against the Battle Of Hoth set the Luke is exactly the same in this new set as the older Battle Of Hoth set.</p>

<p>Next up is Dak&nbsp;Ralter, Luke&#39;s trusty Snowspeeder co-pilot and gunner. &nbsp;Dak is in the same flight suit as Luke but has a much less detailed helmet, it is just plain white with a Rebel logos on each side. Dak appeared in both the earlier versions of the Snowspeeder but has been given the updated more detailed flight suit.</p>

<p>Last but not least is the new 2014 Snowtrooper. &nbsp;This new version has the addition of a white kilt to show the longer lenght armor worn by Snowtroopers to protect them from the freezing temperatures on Hoth. &nbsp;The usual plain black head has been replaced by an angry looking flesh coloured&nbsp;one and the detail printing on the chest is slighly improved from the older figure, the legs remain the same from previous versions. &nbsp;The old one piece helmet and backpack have been replaced with a new smaller 3 piece backpack with a nice printed 1x1 white tile and figures back is also printed but most is hidden by the back pack. The biggest change to the Snowtrooper is the helmet design, the eyes have been made more narrow and are now printed on, which I feel gives them less depth and they just look drawn on. &nbsp;The face mask section of the helmet looks wider and has been given more of a flowing material look which I am not a fan of but some say it is a great improvement, I just prefer the look of the older helmet. &nbsp;Both the Snowtrooper and Dak are armed with standard small blasters.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not overly complicated as you can imagine for what is quite a small set and starts with Bag 1 making the gun emplacement which is very similar to previous versions. &nbsp;The main gun and then a small ammo/power box linked by a black whip/rope piece, nothing really new here. Next up is the Snowspeeder main body, which starts with the main base, then adds the cockpit area and wing hinges. There is 2 stickers to apply which&nbsp;show both the front and rear control panels for the Snowspeeder then the nose cone and sides are built. &nbsp;Rear cable winch and grapple hook are next which is straight forward as long as you are good with tying&nbsp;knots in thin black cotton thread ! &nbsp;The cockpit area has front and rear screens and and these screens are both hinged so you can lift just the pilots screen or both pilot and rear facing gunners canopies, lifting just the front does require holding the rear screen down or the whole front screen just pulls off as it is not firmly connected to the rear section. The rear of the speeder also has a new style stud firing blaster mounted to it just above the rear grapple winch, 5 transparent&nbsp;blue studs are provided for ammo.</p>

<p>Bags 2 and 3 are the wings, 1 bag per side. The wings themselves are pretty straight forward builds, the speeders main cannons are much more detailed than previous versions but from the cockpit forward are the same as the older set. The flap like air brakes are also the same as the comparison version I am using from the Wampa&nbsp;Cave set. The main new point is the addition of the spring loaded missile system set under each wing, these seem to work very well and you can get quite a distance with them.</p>

<p>This is a very nice depiction of the Snowspeeder, in comparion to the Wampa Cave speeder it is larger and more detailed, it is also more in keeping with the film version being grey and white, but I quite like the orange highlights from the older speeder. Mini figures are very nice but nothing that new, just modified. This is a very nice set just not sure the &pound;35&nbsp;price tag is justified I would have&nbsp;said this set should be under &pound;30.</p>

<p>Apologies for the poor quality of the photos, and please note I did not apply the stickers on the Wampa speeder.</p>

"Duq","2014-07-05T01:57:35.393Z","Only for serious collectors","<p>Only a year after 75014 Battle of Hoth there&#39;s another Snowspeeder set. It continues the white and grey colour scheme without the orange accents. This time the only thing outside the speeder is a snow trooper with a mobile gun.</p>

<p>I must admit I&#39;m not the biggest Star Wars fan in the world. I like the old trilogy but I&#39;ve no interest in the prequels, nevermind Clone Wars and extended universe. The ships from those movies are just more of the same; I much prefer the ships from the old movies.</p>

<p>7130 was one of the first Star Wars sets I bought and I&#39;ve had a thing for Snowspeeders since. Unfortunately I don&#39;t have all of them...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Normally there isn&#39;t much to say about the box but this one is a little unusual in that it&#39;s taller than it&#39;s wide. As a result it also opens at the bottom, not at the side. Other than that it&#39;s the usual; ship and minifigs on the front, play functions on the back. The instruction booklet is nearly as big as the box and has the now fairly common &#39;collect these minifigs&#39; list at the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Three bags of parts fill up the box, with the booklet at the bottom and the stickers between two bags. As you&#39;d expect from the picture on the box most parts are white or grey but there&#39;s some tan and black as well as some red and yellow for invisible pieces.</p>

<p>Interesting parts are 4 of the truncated cone/droid head parts in light grey, 2 printed 1x1 tiles for snow trooper backpacks and the new minifig gun. Those tiles are the only printed parts; instruments and decorations on the wing and the cockpit are unfortunately all stickers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 3 minifigs in this set; Luke and Dak in their rebel pilot gear and a snow trooper. The pilots look great; the prints on front and back of the torso, the legs and the helmets look really good. The snow trooper has a new helmet but I don&#39;t like it. The eyes are now printed instead of actual slits. He wears a skirt to suggest the longer winter gear but for me it doesn&#39;t work; it just looks clumsy.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>During the build I had a strong sense of deja-vu. The mobile gun is almost identical to last years version, the only differences are the colour of a few parts and the technic connector that&#39;s used for the barrel.</p>

<p>The body of the snowspeeder is very similar to the previous version; the wing connections are the same, the cockpit canopy is the same as is its hinge connection. The seats for the pilots are slightly different with their legs now sitting in those T-shaped 1x2 panels from Friends. The instrument panels are now on 1x2 cheese slopes instead of 2x2 45 slopes.</p>

<p>The shape of the wings is slightly different as is the detailing of the engine but the overall look is much the same as the previous snowspeeder. Underneath the wings are the new spring-loaded shooters. As a result it needs to sit a little higher off the ground so you now find inverted slopes under the body instead of inverted tiles.</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s an interesting build if this is your first snowspeeder. If you already own 75014 Battle of Hoth or 8089 Hoth Wampa cave then most of it will be very familiar.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a good looking snowspeeder. It has some nice details on the engine and the wings. A nice touch is the new minifig gun that sits on the back. As well as firing clear blue studs it can also fire the grapple hook which is probably the best featur of the set. The shooters under the wing add play value but don&#39;t help the look of the ship. Luckily they&#39;re easy to remove.</p>

<p>The new seating position works well for Luke but unfortunately not so much for Dak; he either leans all the way back with his arms in the air or he sits up a bit but hits his head off the cockpit roof. Speaking of which, I wish Lego would create a proper canopy piece for the snowspeeders. The shape they&#39;ve settle on, with a windscreen and the standard Star Wars canopy just doesn&#39;t look right.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For an overall opinion I have to take the price into account and on this side of the Atlantic it&#39;s a joke. At &euro;40 (&euro;45 in my local shop) it&#39;s barely cheaper than last years&#39; Hoth set which cost &euro;50, but the piece count is only 278 with 3 minifigs compared to 427 with 7 minifigs and a taun-taun. In the US the set costs $30 compared to $50 for the Hoth set.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a bad model but for children it&#39;s just too expensive and for collectors is too similar to the previous version. That&#39;s why my verdict is: unless you&#39;re a serious collector wait for the sales or skip this version of the Snowspeeder.</p>

"HersheyBearsHockey1938","2014-08-11T03:21:11Z","""Hooah! That got 'em!""","<p>To start this review I must state how much a fan I am of the Snowspeeder, the T-47 airspeeder in Star Wars terminology. The concept of the speeder makes for a perfect small size ship built in LEGO, this being the first individually packaged speeder since the 2004 model. There have been plenty of speeders included in various Star Wars sets, including 7666 Hoth Rebel Base and last year&#39;s 75014 Battle of Hoth, but in my opinion this model is the perfect refinement since then. Not to say it&#39;s perfect, but it is a worthwhile addition to any collection.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not have every Snowspeeder that was produced between 2004 and now, the notable exception being the 8089&nbsp;Hoth Wampa Cave model, but the framework has clearly remained the same. This speeder, in contrast to past models, feels like the standalone model that the Snowspeeder deserves, not having been shrunken down to fit through the doors of 7666 or similarly reduced in 75014. This model takes time to be accurate, from the 1x3 slope bricks underneath to make the model look even while stationary to the changes in the harpoon gun to the most minifigure friendly interior of any prior model, with space for weapons and accessories.</p>

<p>Despite the strides this set makes, the less than friendly price tag and value is the thing that will scare most who feel this set stays the same on the exterior. There are a lot of extra parts from each of the sections, and while some like the extra spring shooter and some of the studs for the launcher are welcome, the same general amount of unused parts overall is stunning.</p>

<p>The minifigures round out this package, and perhaps the most interesting of them is the revamped Snowtrooper. No longer a single piece helmet and backpack, but a wider helmet part, neck bracket with a printed flat tile as well as a cloth hip part. He even&nbsp;has the angry clone head from the&nbsp;prequel line in the past, though this is never shown in the actual film.&nbsp;His E-Web cannon is a staple that has evolved to perfection in this model as well. Both the standard pilots of Luke and Dack each have their own revisions, both sporting the same Episode V flight suit from last year, which has slightly less detail than the suit from the X-wing microfighter from earlier this year, but still looks good. Luke has two faces, the standard pilot face and one with the goggles up, for when he exits the speeder. Dack has a confident smile on one side, and a shocked frown as if about to meet his own untimely demise. While Luke&#39;s helmet looks more realistic each time it appears, Dack&#39;s is more or less the same from 1999.</p>

<p>Overall, I feel as though this set will be one that will be skipped for appearing &quot;too similar&quot; and &quot;overdone&quot; considering past models, but it is also a model that I feel has reached perfection. This is by far the most playable model released with the spring shooters and the harpoon gun, and also feels much lighter than prior models. The only thing one could wish for on such a frequently released model would be variety, like the orange model in the Wampa Cave (that every other snowspeeder that didn&#39;t belong to Luke had) and perhaps a different set of pilots would be nice. Giving us Wedge Antilles and his gunner Wes Janson would certainly be a welcome addition for collectors as well as fans, given how much of a fan favorite both the characters are. However, this set is still an excellent purchase, and certainly an excellent model for the price range.</p>

"Groot","2015-12-20T23:33:29.833Z","Echo station 3-T-8, we have spotted Imperial walkers.","<p>I wouldn&#39;t army build this because, Luke&#39;s T-47 Airspeeder is different from all the other ones. His is grey while the rest are orange.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box nicely&nbsp;depicts&nbsp;Luke&#39;s T-47 Airspeeder&nbsp;flying above a snowtrooper manning a E-Web turret.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a nice printed 1x1 plate that you get two of one goes on the trooper and another is an extra piece. You get 3 red ammo for the spring shooters which is nice because I tend to loose them a lot. On the back of the speeder you can find a stud shooter with x5 blue studs, just like the spring-loaded shooter I loose those a lot.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Luke Skywalker&#39;s suit is different from the other regular ones with black hands because this is his Hoth&nbsp;pilot suit which is meant for the cold unlike his one in Star Wars (Episode IV). Dak Ralter&nbsp;has appeared in three other Star Wars sets and this one&nbsp;is the best&nbsp;because his jumpsuit has a lot of more printing&nbsp;than all of the others. Snowtrooper there has been many different variations of the Snowtrooper since 2003 when it first appeared. This version is the best because it looks the most like the one in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back.</p>

<p>The T-47 Airspeeder (actual name look it up) looks just like the one in the movie! The E-Web is pretty much the same as all of the other ones.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really love and recommend&nbsp;this set. I have it on my Hoth display with a lot of other&nbsp;Hoth&nbsp;related items&nbsp;like the Hoth battle packs from a few years back and Echo Base from 2011.</p>

"Scorpus","2015-01-03T04:49:39.34Z","My first Lego Snowspeeder","<p>I&#39;ve never owned one of the numerous Lego Snowspeeders&nbsp;released over the past years, so I was excited to be gifted this on Christmas. Generally I like the model, and it should pair up well with the AT-AT from the same wave that I purchased.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/BL5ws3p.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 424px;"" /></p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Looks exactly like a Snowspeeder with a mostly grey design. This is the best version Lego has released so far in that respect.</li>
	<li>Great scale, and can still fit two minfigs in the speeder</li>
	<li>Can shoot the hook from the stud shooter on the back</li>
	<li>Flaps on the wings can be opened to reveal some engine detailing.</li>
	<li>Very swooshable, which is great for recreating Hoth battle scenes</li>
	<li>Generally fun build, although it&#39;s a bit repetitive building each of the wings (which are mirrored).</li>
	<li>Minifigs look great. I especially like the Snowtrooper as I don&#39;t have any previous variants. Luke and Dack are highly detailed as well, which looks excellent</li>
	<li>Bonus cannon for the Snowtrooper</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Expensive, especially in Australia where the set retails for AU$60. Should be the same price as the other small models from 2014 like the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75038-1/Jedi-Interceptor"" style=""font-size: inherit; letter-spacing: inherit; text-decoration: none; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">Jedi Interceptor</a>&nbsp;and The Phantom.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Lego has released a lot of Snowspeeders over the past few years, so there&#39;s not a lot of incentive to grab the new model over those in 2010&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8089-1/Hoth-Wampa-Cave"">8089 Hoth&nbsp;Wampa Cave</a>&nbsp;or especially&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75014-1/Battle-of-Hoth"">75014 Battle of Hoth</a> from last year.</li>
	<li>Eight stickers in total, including two applied to a 1x2 tile (cockpit controls)&nbsp;that I&#39;d like to have seen printed instead.</li>
</ul>

"mickz","2015-03-03T10:44:26.237Z","small set, but a great looking set","<p>When I began buying Lego Friends for my nieces, I&nbsp;saw this and thought this looks pretty cool so I bought it. &nbsp;It was my first Lego purchase&nbsp;for myself for many, many years, but the third set I actually built. &nbsp;What a great looking speeder.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box as you would expect is not too large, but bigger than trooper packs I&nbsp;saw in the stores. &nbsp;The art on the front depicts the speeder in action as well as showing the gun and snow&nbsp;trooper in action.</p>

<p>There is one instruction booklet included and a sticker sheet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are three bags of Lego&nbsp;included in the box and mostly consist of white and grey parts. You get two spring loaded launchers and I must stress, do not point these at anyone because they fire really well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get a total of three&nbsp;minifigures in this set and they look amazing. &nbsp;The detail that gets put into the minifigures really astounds me. &nbsp;The printing on the helmets and torsos of Luke and Dak, as well as details of the snow&nbsp;troopers&nbsp;helmet all look awesome.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself was fairly simple but enjoyable. I spent approximately 1.5 hours on this set. &nbsp;The body is built with the first bag then the wings, bags two and three, which get attached to the main body.</p>

<p>The snow troopers canon is quite simple but looks good too and the parts are included in the first bag. &nbsp;Come to think of it it is the first bit of kit you build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>In my previous reviews I have not really said much about scale. &nbsp;I think I might on this review - when I sat this next to the AT-AT(75054) it&nbsp;looks too large, or the AT-AT too small. &nbsp;Either way something just doesn&#39;t look right when they are next to each other. A minor niggle&nbsp;though.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This set, although simple, looks great when completed with all the stickers attached. &nbsp;</span>I really like the speeders top canons, they look way cool and the flaps on the wings too. &nbsp;While the harpoon fires well if you wind on the string very loosely, it doesn&#39;t quite work when wound tight, but this is a minor niggle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think that this set is a great representation of the vehicle portrayed in the movies. &nbsp;I do have some minor niggles though as mentioned above. &nbsp;I got this set on special before Christmas 2014, I don&#39;t think the price matches what you get however.</p>
