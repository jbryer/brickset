<p>Big box, great for display. With the new star wars stormtrooper&nbsp;logo on it. Makes you wanna&nbsp;open it and start right away...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some new stuff, but nothing really stands out</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is the greatest thing in this baby. New trooper...!!!! Zeb has great colours and awesome headpiece, Hera is very detailed, my only objection is Kanan, he could be better presented</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Had great time. The skeleton of the ship is a nice experience, with lots of technic pieces</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very sturdy, very close to the ship from the series</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really enjoyed&nbsp;my time building it. It is a very nice addition to my collection</p>

<p>Clear as usual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Many not so common colored parts (goblin green and white). A very good point for this model.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All the minifigs are exclusive to this set (yet). They looks like pretty well as in the show.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A very good experience as some steps are not obvious and they come to amazing results.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The ship is pretty heavy and compact. The global shape evokes pretty well the original ship but I think it&#39;s not really accurate on the belly.</p>

<p>Playability is not as fun as for the Millenium Falcon for example.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>At the end, this ship is not worth buying for itself ; the minifigd are the real assets of the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Box/Instructions</h2>

<p>The box is BIG! it also gives you a good idea of what&#39;s going on in the set, the instructions are cool! its quite specific too!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I must say its got a lot of useful parts, but i wouldn&#39;t take this set apart!!! it&#39;s too <strong>GOOD!</strong></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It has a good selection of Minifigs, i love how detailed they are! not quite sure on Zeb though...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is long!!! and hard (if you stay up till 1 in the morning), But it&#39;s a cool build overall a lot of new building techniques&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks cool overall! I&nbsp;love the look of it! But it has a dark side... It&#39;s kind of hard to lift and you need to hold it with 2 hand if you don&#39;t want it falling apart, its very sturdy though i dropped it once and it just got some minor damage.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this set is a great addition to your Star Wars Rebels Collection! I don&#39;t quite like that it doesn&#39;t&nbsp;have the Crews cabins, and it doesn&#39;t have Sabine! But is a cool set!</p>

"aredotam","2014-10-14T23:23:35.18Z","A Fun Beginning to the newest Star Wars LEGO Series","<p>The Ghost comes from the new Star Wars cartoon series Rebels, and is the ship of the main characters. I&rsquo;m not too knowledgeable about this new series right now &ndash; only know some of the basics. So I didn&rsquo;t have any real expectations for this set, other than I hoped it would be as cool as the picture on the box. I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>Overall Look: The appearance of this set captured my attention on first sight. It has the semi-bulky lines and patchwork exterior that reminded me of the Millennium Falcon (although the Ghost is a symmetrical vehicle). The Ghost looked sturdy with plenty of play potential. After I saw some of the material from the new Star Wars cartoon I realized that this set is a great representation of the ship on the screen. While not to scale (of course) it captures all of the primary elements seen in the cartoon: gun turrets, cockpit, escape pods (which may actually be docking rings in the cartoon), and unique engine cluster.</p>

<p>Sturdiness: This set is built around a frame that utilizes technic pieces (not too many to be difficult) and is thus very sturdy. The Ghost is fairly heavy, which adds to the tough feeling of the set. However some of the detail work on the outside of the ship can pop with just a moderate level of pressure. Overall, I think that if this set were dropped on the ground it would lose a lot of outside pieces, but would mostly stay in one piece (not that I plan to test this assumption).</p>

<p>Gun Turrets and Cockpit: The placement of these elements is right on, includes a decent level of detail, and provides a good level of playability. The turrets and cockpit are small inside, of course, but I was surprised to find that the minifigures are easily inserted and removed. The dorsal gun turret pops up and out as one unit in order to access a seat for a minifigure. The ventral gun turret canopy opens, and the entire seating area slides out for easy access. In fact, this turret might be the most easily accessed of any part of the ship&rsquo;s interior. The cockpit is snug and the canopy is on the smaller side, but it&rsquo;s still easy to insert or remove a minifigure.</p>

<p>Storage: The Ghost has two large storage areas on either side of the cockpit. The access panels swing up and are made to look just like any other part of the exterior. The starboard area has a place to securely store a lightsaber and blaster, along with additional open space. The port storage area has a secure holding place for a spare missile for the spring loaded shooter (more on that later), and is large enough to also hold Zeb Orrelios&rsquo; long bow-staff. There&rsquo;s also a small drop-down holding area on the bottom of the Ghost which houses a storage box and holocron.</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set comes with 4 all-new minifigures based on the new cartoon series Rebels: Kanan Jarrus, Hera Syndulla, Zeb Orrelios, and a new Stormtrooper. Every component of the three rebels is unique (as far as I can tell) and spot-on to the cartoon characters. Even the Stormtrooper, with unique blue trim on his helmet, matches the new armor in the cartoon series. Once again, I think LEGO did a great job with its minifigures.</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>Shaky Detail Work: As mentioned above, some pieces of the ship&rsquo;s hull &ndash; which give it such a great look &ndash; can come off at odd times. This happened especially while I was in the building process. It&rsquo;s obviously not bad enough in my opinion that it ruins the overall set and experience.</p>

<p>Docking Area for the Phantom: The Ghost and the smaller Phantom set (set # 75048) are made to dock together &ndash; a very cool feature. For this reason I went ahead and spent the extra money to get The Phantom. However after assembling both sets it was a pain to get the Phantom to actually dock with the back of the Ghost. At first I found that the Ghost&rsquo;s primary engines are mounted too closely to really fit the Phantom. That was easily fixed by adding a couple pieces to the engine mounts. I also decided to remove a few pieces from the Phantom to make a little more room as well. Then I found that the Phantom wouldn&rsquo;t physically snap into place on the Ghost. I solved the issue with a 2x4 tile in place of the 2x2 tile with centered single stud that was provided. It&rsquo;s possible I didn&rsquo;t assemble the set correctly in the first place, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure this is just a minor design flaw.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>The Ghost is a fabulous set, which looks good and has good playability. The minifigures are incredible and vibrant. If the new Rebels cartoon gets a good reception, I hope we&rsquo;ll get more great sets like this. Also, I recommend buying The Phantom to complete the look, if you have a few extra bucks.</p>

I bought The Ghost and The Phantom together, which should go together and both look great. I had a hard time getting the Phantom to dock with Ghost like it should. I thought I had&nbsp;assembled&nbsp;it wrong but I am sure it is a design flaw that can be easily fixed with the correct parts.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is big looks great, the instructions were fairly clear and came in two books.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I liked the parts and love using a mix of sets (Lego blocks and technic pieces) with many specialty parts to give it some character. A few stickers to stick just right&nbsp;as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigs are Star Wars and&nbsp;cool. Missing Sabine though which is very&nbsp;disappointing. She&#39;s the bomb....get it?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I took my time and enjoyed the build over several days. Six bags of parts is a lot of parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Again, I agree with&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/profile/aredotam"" rel=""author"" style=""color: rgb(6, 144, 214); font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold; font-size: 17px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">aredotam</a>, many parts of the ship are assembled to the point where handling the set the wrong way will cause parts to fall off. I don&#39;t understand why some pieces are assembled the way they are.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am a new adult Lego builder but have built a few small and medium sets and one large Star Wars set. This set was exciting to build and somewhat challenging but&nbsp;not as satisfying when complete because of all the loose parts and the fact that the Phantom will not fit together with the Ghost. The Ghost looks weird with the missing Phantom not attached to it.</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-10-09T22:31:06.16Z","Fantastic set","<p>I bought this set because I have&nbsp;needed it since the moment I saw it in &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;. And, although I expected to find a not-so-well-made set, because Lego had to make it smaller than it is, I found it very impressive.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is one of the largest you can find. Instructions are clear, always.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It contains a lot of parts. It has three cockpits, several turrets, and that light green pieces that I think are quite rare.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are one of the reasons I bought the set. They are the main characters of &quot;Rebels&quot;: Hera, Kanan and Zeb. The Lego Hera is very nice, but I think the head appears too big. Kanan is Just as he should be, same is for Zeb. He has a bo-rifle, like Agent Kallus. The stormtropper&nbsp;is like the other ones we can find in &quot;Rebels&quot; sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I enjoyed a lot building this set. It&#39;s very big, and I spent a lot of time (but not so much) to build it. It was very nice to see it&nbsp;became more similar to the pictures while proceeding building it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed mode,&nbsp;as I said many times, is very big. It can be grabbed from below, but you won&#39;t find any apposite handle (like in Republic Frigate from &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;&nbsp;and Imperial Cruiser from &quot;Rebels&quot;). It&#39;s heavy, but you don&#39;t risk to make it fall. It has many features, and can be opened in like every part of it. Oh, I forgot the most impressive thing: on the rear you can make the &quot;Phantom&quot; shuttle dock, by fitting it and forming a single starship.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The &quot;Ghost&quot; is a really good set. Although it&#39;s a bit expensive, it&#39;s worth the price, and with the &quot;Phantom&quot; on its rear it&#39;s ugual to the TV one. You&#39;ll have a lot of fun with it, and with its minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Pretty representative&nbsp;of the original model</p>

<p>&ndash; Nice and rare minifigures</p>

<p>&ndash; Pretty detailed with nice turrets</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; A bit disproportioned</p>

<p>&ndash; Upper turret isn&rsquo;t fixed to the hull</p>

<p>&ndash; Lower parts aren&rsquo;t well defined</p>

"davy_jones","2020-07-25T15:52:38.05Z","Spark of Rebellion","<p>Star Wars Rebels was a great series that featured several memorable characters, ships and sub-plots. Dave Filoni and team certainly did a great job of expanding the Star Wars universe and by extension an inspired line of Lego creations.</p>

<p>The Ghost can be considered a mid-size set as it&#39;s about half a meter long and weighs about one and a half kilograms. The leads to a set that provides a good building experience, nice aesthetics, interesting minifigures and several accessories.</p>

<p>The good:</p>

<p>1) Nicely sized spaceship.</p>

<p>2) Manages to capture the overall shape of the Ghost well.</p>

<p>3) Minifigures for Kanan and Hera are well detailed and resemble the characters quite closely.</p>

<p>4) Weapons and accessories provided. Zeb&#39;s Bo staff in particular is creatively put together with a <span style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68,68,68); font-size: 16px"">black lightsaber hilt and two blasters.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68,68,68); font-size: 16px"">5) The lower cockpit slide out feature is useful for play.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68,68,68); font-size: 16px"">6) Two slide out escape pods with seating for one.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68,68,68); font-size: 16px"">7) Panels which lift to store lightsaber.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68,68,68); font-size: 16px"">8) The Phantom ship can also dock with this set as in the series.</span></p>

<p>The bad:</p>

<p>1) The actual Ghost ship is battle scarred due to the various skirmishes that the rebels get entangled in. The set looks too clean in comparison.</p>

<p>2) Zeb&#39;s legs are completely different from the character in the series. Even his torso and arm prints are not too similar.</p>

<p>3) Handling the ship is a bit tricky since some parts slide easily as they are designed &nbsp;for play.</p>

<p>4) Another Stormtrooper would have been nice.</p>

<p>5) Some panels could be sturdier.</p>

<p>The verdict:</p>

<p>There are some faults to this set however, like the Rebels series which featured multi-layered characters, this set is also rewarding once the faults are looked past. There are several features such as the hidden storage, sliding cockpit and overall design which make it a good addition to your collection especially for Rebels fans.</p>

<p>While I did enjoy this set, Rebels wasn&#39;t my favourite. The inflation on this set right now is absurd.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigs (3/5)</strong>: A small, but good selection.&nbsp;I think an Ezra minifig could have been nice, but he was in the phantom. Not really a whole lot else to say, just wish there was a little more for that $90 RRP.<br />
<br />
<strong>The build (4/5)</strong>: To be honest, I don&#39;t really remember the build. It was probably fine at the time, seeing as younger me built it correctly.<br />
<br />
<strong>Parts (4/5)</strong>: There wasn&#39;t a lot of piece inflation&nbsp;on this set. There are a few <em>&quot;rare&quot;&nbsp;</em>pieces on this build, and quite a few bigger pieces. To me personally, as long as the set ends up looking good and being stable, the part selection doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

<p><strong>Playability (5/5)</strong>: From what I remember when I was younger, this set was pretty fun. A good amount of interior space while keeping compact is always a plus. The most fun part about this set in my opinion, would be the escape pods. They are perfect for making fun little scenes with your minifigures. Also being able to attach the phantom (75048) is fun and accurate to the show.</p>

<p><strong>Value (3/5)</strong>: Unless you <em>really&nbsp;</em>enjoy Rebels, I would not recommend purchasing. Right now the set is $230+ for the set WITHOUT minifigures. The set on release however, was an alright price. It wasn&#39;t anything special in terms of price per piece, and only 4 minifigs. Not the best price I suggest waiting for the price to slow down.<br />
<br />
<strong>The look (5/5)</strong>: Accurate to the show, and keeps the studs to fit with the Lego vibe. I can&#39;t say much other than accuracy is on point. Most of the play features are well hidden, and won&#39;t look bad on a shelf. Overall, very nice looking.</p>

The building experience was ok... not particularly&nbsp;good, nothing that screams, it was normal.

I think the coolest part was how the phantom was able to connect to the back of the set.
