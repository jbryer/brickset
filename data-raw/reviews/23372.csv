So, the fire lion, is it worth for my $50, read to find out.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s an old, traditional paperboard box that we&#39;ve seen like more than a thousand times. But this one is satisfying me. Cool fire element&nbsp;design on most of it. On the back we have the play abilities, on the sides we have the minifigures, the introduction, and more miscellaneous&nbsp;stuff.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve got to say for $50, we only get 450 pieces, so that&#39;s kinda&nbsp;disappointing. But then, there are many parts that are recolored, like the large constraction hands, the helicopter&#39;s blades,... are all in<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;the&nbsp;</span>flameish<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;yellow</span>&nbsp;and some new elements&nbsp;to.&nbsp;The prints on the minifigures&#39; torsos and legs are just&nbsp;surprisingly beautiful.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>We have 2 standard minifigs, and 1 big-fig. Laval the lion, Cragger the croc and Mungus the mamooth&nbsp;. Laval and Cragger we have them before, but this is their latest version, using the fire chi system, and like I just said, the prints on their torsos and legs are just beautiful. Mungus is a&nbsp;big-fig himself, with a tiny minifig head inside, and I think is&nbsp;so funny,&nbsp;I also don&#39;t&nbsp;like these ice tribes characters that much, probably of their zombie-like look, that&#39;s just so creepy. But still, 2 minifigs and 1 big-fig for a $50 set, that&#39;s pretty nice for the minifigs collectors</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is sometimes quite challenging and difficult, even for me, a guy which&nbsp;has out of this set&#39;s age range. Though, I&#39;ve gained more building experiences from this set. And it took me 1h and 37 minutes to complete.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks good, from some angle only. Some of the lion hair is hard to pose, same thing goes with the hands, too. Entered the fire chi power mode, It&#39;s looks much better then the normal mode, a lot of things are moving. There&#39;s a flick missiles box, so you can take down Mungus if the&nbsp;fire chi&nbsp;power mode didn&#39;t work. And you can also store the weapons, tools, and a classic blue chi&nbsp;crystal too.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set has&nbsp;great play abilities, great minifigures, great parts, great color scheme, and many other stuff that I don&#39;t like about it, such as the price, the quantity of parts. But, if you are a hardcore chima fan, especially for the lions, I am absolutely&nbsp;recommended this one for you.</p>

"brickman3","2014-12-30T03:18:30.073Z","Mungus make the hurting!","<p>This set is one of the biggest look-a-likes to the Lion tribe (next to the Lion Chi Temple). However, it isn&#39;t as good as you would think. Here is a quick review of the characters:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mungus-</strong></p>

<p>Mungus is the biggest Chima mini... no wait. FIGURE&nbsp;of all. He come with that big ol&#39; pounder, and a spot for THREE Chi orbs. The only problem, however, is that his elephant head piece keeps coming off, probably because of his big ol&#39; head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Laval-</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Laval is the only one of his making, except their is another one without armor. That set is a Speedorz set, Fire and Ice.&nbsp;In this set, he is the main driver of the Fire Lion, and comes with a fire weapon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cragger-</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, exclusive to this set. The other version of him has different armor, in Cragger&#39;s Fire Striker. In this set, he is Laval&#39;s co-pilot, and has a fire weapon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, for the pros and cons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>cool characters</li>
	<li>Fire Chi vehicle mode</li>
	<li>Chi storage</li>
	<li>Fire Chi</li>
	<li>regular Chi</li>
	<li>claws on vehicle that move</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>smaller than thought of</li>
	<li>hard to move without activating Fire Chi mode</li>
	<li>more mammoths?</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I feel like LEGO did a very good job with this set.</p>

"exorallan31","2022-09-07T13:03:26.113Z","Erm.. Yeah! i like this set","<p>As I am reviewing some older sets, I picked another Chima set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Putting this set together was a solid experience. If you like technic this is for you. I&#39;m not a big technic fan, however. Apart from the technic stuff it was actually very fun.</p>

<p>For the parts, there&#39;s some great stuff here. Some hero factory hands, wheels and treads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the figures, Laval and craggier are nothing rare but they look pretty good. Just nothing rare.</p>

<p>But the highlight here is Mungus. The only Chima bigfig. He has a fun spiked club weapon and it&#39;s very cool to have a Chima Bigfig.</p>

<p>The main fire lion is very interesting. it is one of those funky tracked vehicles but it looks pretty cool and has some fun play features.</p>

<p>You have a thing that shoots 4 missiles at once. Now normally I don&#39;t like flick missiles but here it&#39;s pretty fun. The main function is, of course, chi fire mode and this is pretty cool. A lot of stuff is moving at once very smoothly, so I love this function. Great play value here.</p>

<p>The PPP wasn&#39;t all that great but you do get a Bigfig here, maybe that&#39;s part of the reason.</p>

<p>So overall I really like this set. It looks cool, has cool functions, cool figures, cool everything!</p>
