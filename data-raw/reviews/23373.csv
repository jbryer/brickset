So today I&#39;ll be reviewing one of my favorite sets from my childhood: Emmet&#39;s Construct-o-Mech!</p>

<h2>Backstory:</h2>

<p>I loved The LEGO Movie when my parents took me to watch it on opening night as a birthday gift, and I specially liked the final battle scene in which Emmet fights all the micro managers with his mech (I still think that scene is awesome). So it wasn&#39;t surprising that I was so freaking happy when a few months after watching The LEGO Movie, my grandma visited me and gave me this set. And even though I don&#39;t exactly remember playing a lot with this set, I still love it, and I&#39;m kinda sad that I can&#39;t display it because it&#39;s currently resting in pieces inside my spare parts box (but I guess that makes it accurate to The LEGO Movie 2, because one of the flashbacks reveals that the mech eventually gets destroyed in-canon). I think I should rebuild it some day...</p>

<h2>Build:</h2>

<p>Because of the high piece count, I had a lot of fun building this set (I know 708 pieces might not be one of the highest piece counts to ever exist, but it sure was a lot for 9 year-old me to build), and even though this mech is smaller than the actual mech Emmet had in the movie, it&#39;s still huge, and it has a lot of detail to make it accurate to what we see in the movie. Though I have some issues with the build:</p>

<p>-The mech has a fairly limited range of articulation, specially in the legs, which can only move up and down, and have knees that are permanently stuck in a specific position.</p>

<p>-The set lacks side builds, but I guess the designers behind this set had to avoid including any side builds in order to make the mech as detailed as possible without having such a high piece count.</p>

<p>And I can&#39;t really say much about the play features, as the only play feature this set has is the mech&#39;s claw, which can be opened, and then it closes automatically thanks to a rubber band.</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>The minifigure selection is decent: It comes with an exclusive version of Unikitty, a not so exclusive version of Emmet (he also comes in the Emmet Fun Pack from LEGO Dimensions), and 2 skeletrons. It&#39;s not a relatively high amount of minifigures, but that&#39;s OK considering that this set focuses entirely on the main build.</p>

<h2>Price:</h2>

<p>The $60 price is fine. It&#39;s a bit high, so not everyone might be able to get it, but I think that&#39;s a reasonable price for such a detailed build.</p>

<h2>Extra:</h2>

<p>Oh, and I almost forgot: This set includes a cheat code printed on a 1x4 yellow flat tile which unlocks angry Unikitty in The LEGO Movie Videogame (I&#39;m not gonna tell you the code, so if you wanna unlock Unikitty, you&#39;ll either have to buy the set or look up the code on Google). This is not a really important feature, but it&#39;s a nice detail to add some &ldquo;extra playability&rdquo; for those who have the game (I have it, and it&#39;s pretty cool, you should check it out).</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is an awesome set that works perfectly as a toy and as a display piece, and I&#39;d recommend it to any LEGO Movie fan that&#39;s looking for a good set to add to their collection.</p>
