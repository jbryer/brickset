"18000pieces","2014-06-06T04:40:56.033Z","Retail set of the year? Retail set of the year!","<p>It&#39;s hard to overstate the anticipation felt for this set. Ever since the tidbit of casting news that Charlie Day would be playing a spaceman in The Lego Movie was released, fans had been wondering, hoping, praying that this would finally be the year that Lego formalized a Classic Space revival. When the first picture leaked back in January, the response was overwhelming - many people thought the model looked too good to be true. Lego would never give us such a HUGE set, would they?</p>

<p>When the movie came around and Charlie Day&#39;s Benny stole the show and put the SPACESHIP! in everyone&#39;s mind, it all made sense. But does the set itself live up to all the high expectations set for it? Read on and find out... (spoiler: yes, it does).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a standard $100 price-point size, large but not overly so. The design is eye-catching, emphasizing the Spaceship&#39;s bright colors against a warm peach cityscape background, with the Lego Movie film-strip branding in the corners.</p>

<p>The instructions are packed in a flat bag with cardboard, always a nice touch. There are two volumes, the first of which covers four bags and the second of which covers the remaining three. The instructions are clearly printed on a simple, Creator-style blue and yellow background. Best of all, the shouting &quot;WIN!&quot; kid on the back cover is gone, replaced with a placid minifigure! (it was about time)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts really steal the show here, and that&#39;s not easy when the show is as spectacular as the completed model. I almost wish that I could afford to buy another copy, just to get the bounty of parts it offers for Neo-Classic Space building without having to take apart the model. The parts palette here is a beautiful blend of old and new. Old: RCS blocks! Fins! Big grey wedge plates! Blue slopes! Crystals! Space seats! New: launchers galore! Donut plates! Hoses! Little wedge plates! The model is full to bursting with neat and useful parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best, of course, come from the blending of new and old - new windscreens in old trans-yellow. New 4x2x1 slopes with the old Classic Space logo. These will be a boon to anyone who wants to build Neo-Classic Space, and they&#39;re great-looking parts just on their own, too.</p>

<p>It also seems worth mentioning here that the sticker sheet contains four large freestanding Classic Space logos that aren&#39;t shaped to go on any particular part (you&#39;re told the put them on the fins on the back, but they aren&#39;t specific to fins). I&#39;ve decided to save mine, so now I can make any part I want Classic Space-y!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are fewer minifigures than one might expect in a $100 set, but they&#39;re all firecrackers.</p>

<p>Benny is the centerpiece, of course, since it&#39;s his Spaceship. He&#39;s only available here and in the even more expensive Metalbeard&#39;s Sea Cow. His cracked helmet looks great, and his face is reversible with his goofy grin on one side and a standard spaceman smile on the other. His chest logo is scratched, which is accurate to the movie, but will be annoying to anyone who wants to make perfect, non-damaged spacemen as a standard.</p>

<p>Emmett is fairly standard, except that he&#39;s in his Robot disguise of dubious quality. It&#39;s a nice variation from the endless normal Emmetts we get in other sets. The Piece of Resistance comes in pearl silver, which is nice.</p>

<p>Lucy has a cool, graffiti-styled riff on the classic space suit, complete with a blue hood piece.</p>

<p>The Octan&nbsp;pilot is suitably menacing, with a fighter-pilot mask on his robot face. The Octan logo on his torso could be useful elsewhere.</p>

<p>And, of course, everyone&#39;s favorite Unicorn/Cat hybrid Uni-kitty is there, in her own spacesuit. She&#39;s as adorable as ever.</p>

<p>It would have been nice to have one or two other characters included - Scribble-face Bad Cop was only a collectible minifigure, but he&#39;s fairly relevant to the scene in the movie where the Spaceship gets built. I also seem to recall a certain man who dresses up as a bat being present, though most of us already have plenty of versions of him :P And even though none of them are in the movie, it would have been great to get some classic spacemen without Benny&#39;s scuffed-up torso. I guess we&#39;ll have to wait until the Cuusoo exo-suit comes out for that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about three hours, including some time spent building while eating lunch. It&#39;s entertaining throughout; twofold symmetry rarely gets tedious, and there are no tank treads or repetitive greebles to assemble. The mechanism that extends the wings is a clever and satisfying build. In fact, the entire build is satisfying. The set is incredibly solid and sturdy from front to back, and it&#39;s fun to see everything click into place as you go. I particularly enjoyed the construction of the interior &#39;bridge&#39; area beneath Uni-kitty&#39;s&nbsp;socket, as it takes place gradually across multiple bags, each one adding its own neat aspect of what eventually becomes a seamlessly integrated and well-hidden room.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is, in a word, impressive. It&#39;s a huge ship - the only one I have that can be placed next to the enormous 7065 Alien Mothership and not look dwarfed by it. It&#39;s about 64 studs long, and with the wings extended and the fighters clipped on it&#39;s almost 60 studs wide! There&#39;s a ton of details and greebles&nbsp;and fins and hoses in the back half of the model, almost threatening to overwhelm it, but the simple, clean lines of its wedge-like shape are strong enough that it pulls through and looks great from just about every angle. The play features are fun, from opening the bridge to taking out the little robots to extending the wings (not to mention fully three types of shooter! The kids will be entertained for hours!). And, most important of all, once you&#39;ve built it it really feels like a classic space model. My dad, who played with those classic sets like the Galaxy Explorer first-hand, confirms it - it reminded him of his childhood almost instantly when I showed it to him. And anyone who holds it can&#39;t help but swoosh it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As my title says, I consider this to be the retail set of the year for 2014 so far, and I doubt anything will top it. In fact, I might go so far as to call it the retail set of the decade - it feels like a Lego Exclusive model, it&#39;s priced like a Lego Exclusive, it has the attention to detail and the reverence for history and the lavish construction of an Exclusive - but it&#39;s a retail set. This is a special one, a must-buy for anyone who likes Lego Space and/or The Lego Movie. I can&#39;t recommend it more highly - it now takes pride of place in my collection, next to the 10188 Death Star and the Tower of Orthanc. It captures something primal, something unique about Classic Space, and puts a thrilling modern spin on it. I mean, what else is there to say? Except for...</p>

"tkettle9719","2014-06-26T17:13:50.203Z","The LEGO Movie 70816: Benny's Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP! REVIEW","<p>When I first saw &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot; in February, one of the greatest things about the movie was the amount of reverence there was to the past of the LEGO Group; while many of the products sold nowadays are on licensed products, LEGO did not start off this way at all; instead of Star Wars, there was a singular Space line; Lord of the Rings was a substitute for the Castle line (whose last run could have been stronger). Pirates? Not of the Carribean back then. And the Adventure line was amazing, and would soon be replaced by Indiana Jones. The point is, LEGO has a rich history, and no theme has a deeper resonance in the brains of thirty-something-year-olds than the Classic Space line from the late 1970s to the 80s, even into the 90s. A Space that was imaginative, unrestricted, and purely AWESOME.</p>

<p>When I saw Benny the 1980 Something Space Guy begin to build his spaceship, (you know, the one he keeps drooling over during the film?) you know nostalgia is about to hit you over the head. And hit it does. This is the ultimate set for everyone in the family; those who love Classic Space will reminisce over their childhood; kids looking for the GREATEST TOY EVER will surely drool just looking at this. And for MOCers... forget it. Benny&#39;s Spaceship hits the ballpark on EVERYTHING!</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>As always, LEGO makes sure that the minifigure&nbsp;line is nothing but perfect; the Robo SWAT member is suitably imposing in his armor and red visor, calling back Octan. Benny is brilliantly realized with a worn appearance and Space callbacks galore. Emmet is poorly concealed in his robotic disguise, which looks fairly comical, although the Piece of Resistance looks great in this color. Astro Kitty is adorable as ever with her Spacesuit, gold boots, and the Space logo. Wildstyle&nbsp;has the logo as well, and comes with a sweet blue hood and a very cool Space jacket. Amazing detail.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Speaking of detail... Good God, there&#39;s a ton of it! Many small pieces are used on the top, especially the stud pieces. The command deck, which is under Astro Kitty, is also another great addition to the set, calling back memories of bases past. The sheer size of the ship, too, is something surprising; nearly 64-stud width and 60-stud length; all of the stops are pulled on making this ship amazing AWESOME. This makes for a great display.</li>
	<li>This is the perfect set for any kid; it&#39;s brimming with playability possibilities; the ship itself contains 8 missiles (two of them are the new spring-loaded missiles, two of the massive cannons in yellow, four flick-fire missiles), the BEST characters from the film, excluding Vitruvius, a small ship to fight, and even the extendable wings are incredibly fun, revealing the spring cannons when extended. This is the definition of FUN.</li>
	<li>This is a callback to the Classic Space Line, and it would not be a very informative review to mention the archetypes that are present; besides the obvious blue-gray-red-trans yellow color scheme, the mini-ships are easily classic Space gold, along with the callback to the original logo of the Space series. The many parts on display here are also worth mentioning; the classic rockets, the radar dish, the green and red light, the little robots, and the steering nozzle... this all just works and instantly reads Space theme all over.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I was really taken aback by the sheer sturdiness of this build; LEGO, over the years, has really made sure that every set is sturdy and cohesive, and this model is no exception to that promise; while the ship feels incredibly heavy for its size (it is incredibly sleek, to be honest), it&#39;s very heavy because Lego makes sure that this ship doesn&#39;t break on you. LEGO has done a fine job of ensuring that this set will deliver fun for a long time.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The build itself is also a major draw; without really spoiling any of it, the ship itself does contain an abundance of symmetry, which can sometimes get very boring. Yet, in Benny&#39;s Spaceship, that doesn&#39;t really seem to be a real issue. It just looks spectacular, and the build is particularly exciting because it starts off immediately looking like the ship, unlike some sets where it doesn&#39;t even look close to the ship until the end. Many major squeals were had, especially when placing on the new cockpit.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>With a model of such gigantic proportions and detail, the stickers were an inevitable part of the build, but they are especially a nuisance in this set; 25 of them are included (and are relatively essential to the nostalgic factors of this set), and, while they are the sticky clear backed stickers, they are also not made to fit on the parts they are selected to be applied to; with that, there is uneven applying, which does detract a bit from this set.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>I also had a bit of a challenge fitting Wyldstyle&nbsp;into the main cockpit area, as was shown on the promotional material. Although the command center did need someone to man it, with Wyldstyle&nbsp;being the perfect candidate, I feel as though this is a very misleading advertisement, which really bugs me, as I would have liked to display all of the characters in the central cockpit to show them off.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>With a set this large, playability is already present in a massive amount; yet, if you&#39;re like me, I loved to stage massive battles with multiple ships at a time. Even though the main attraction of this set was Benny&#39;s Spaceship, I can&#39;t help but feel that the Robo SWAT guy looks like nothing compared to the sheer size of Benny&#39;s ship; it&#39;s so big, so overpowering. For some, I recommend pairing this with the Police Dropship that came out in the same wave; Space Police, anybody?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>SPACESHIP!!!!</p>

<p>For the record, this is just about one of the most marvelous non-licensed LEGO sets in recent memory; this is exactly what LEGO is for so many people. It&#39;s about cool spaceships that really test imagination. It&#39;s about playability that will go on for ages. It&#39;s about creating memories. And that&#39;s what this set does for all groups; kids, adults, etc.; Benny&#39;s Sapceship and, indeed, the whole of &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot;, is about childhood; that indescribable period, the happiest time of our lives. It&#39;s about inventiveness. It&#39;s about nostalgia. And LEGO could not have summed it up better than with this SPACESHIP!. I highly recommend this to every LEGO fan ever. This is an amazing set that everyone should experience.&nbsp;</p>
",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Erylion","2014-08-16T03:32:27.437Z","Even better up-close.","<p>Like many who have enjoyed &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot;, I drooled over the first images of Benny&#39;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!!! and coveted the craft.&nbsp; Birthday time came around and my wife knew exactly what to get for me.&nbsp; It looked great in the movie, and in the pictures on the internet, but none of those images could do justice to the solid, swooshable, classic glory of this ship.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The large box is by no means misleading.&nbsp; Unlike a bag of chips (crisps?), there isn&#39;t a whole lot of empty space.&nbsp; The instructions (two large booklets) are wrapped in a bag of their own with a cardboard backing to prevent wrinkles or creasing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As you would expect, there are a few familiar parts that harken back to the earliest of Space sets.&nbsp; There are also quite a few useful newer pieces, like the many 2x2 smooth round plates with a hole in the middle, which, as you will find during the build, allow for the reversal of studs.&nbsp; Quite handy.&nbsp; Great yellow windshields, lots of useful blue and grey parts.&nbsp; Fantastic spring-loaded missiles that pack quite a punch.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You&#39;d be cold-hearted indeed if Benny and his cracked helmet didn&#39;t make you smile.&nbsp; The old-school spaceman comes with a two-sided head, one side being the original generic smiley face with the other being Benny&#39;s ecstatic &quot;SPACESHIP!!!&quot; expression.&nbsp; Wildstyle is sporting a matching spacesuit with hood accessory, and the printing is pretty cool on her torso too.&nbsp; Unikitty is also arrayed as one of the crew, and while she is not quite a minifig in the traditional sense, she definitely belongs.&nbsp; The 1x3 arch is printed with the Classic Space logo, no sticker, as is the 1x3 brick for her face.&nbsp; Emmet&#39;s hard hat is interesting, in that it includes brown hair.&nbsp; His face and legs have some lingering aluminum foil disguise, which is...unique.&nbsp; The robot fighter pilot is pretty cool, and I imagine its head in particular will be of interest for MOCs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Engaging, with a few interesting techniques and some really beautiful results, not all of which are visible from the exterior.&nbsp; The control room, for example (just beneath Unikitty&#39;s perch) is designed nicely, with a window into the ship&#39;s reactor core.&nbsp; Great little details.&nbsp; The technic mechanism that allows the wings to extend and reveal additional weaponry is a great touch.&nbsp; Some unexpected parts usage is fun, like the castle windows with grates acting as engine air intake.&nbsp; It&#39;s really very sturdy, and feels sooooo good to hold and swoosh.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Need I say more?&nbsp; You can tell from the pictures that it&#39;s a beauty.&nbsp; It&#39;s sturdy and full of play features too.&nbsp; No qualms whatsoever for my part.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I cannot fathom the mind that would ever regret this purchase.&nbsp; Worth every penny.</p>

"HarleyMeenen","2016-09-04T03:09:36.103Z","Benny Would Be Proud","<p>I suppose I might be biased, because Benny is one of my all-time&nbsp;favorite characters. But I also tend to dislike building vehicles, so maybe it will balance out.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set is a great value. There are a number of minifigures which are only available with this set. It also includes&nbsp;Robocop&#39;s ship and two mini-ships in addition to Benny&#39;s spaceship, which enhances the playability.</p>

<p>The main ship is surprisingly large. It has a number of neat details, such as computer screens, plenty of seats in the cockpit, and expanding wings. It also has four places for&nbsp;missiles that can&nbsp;actually fire.</p>

<p>Some of the build is a bit boring, but it&#39;s not particularly repetitive. There are stickers, but they&#39;re actually pretty easy to place and I didn&#39;t have much trouble with them. Some bits are a bit tricky and it&#39;s not the most stable set.</p>

<p>Despite the few minor issues, I love this set. I&#39;ve built it several times and I love the way it looks. For display or play, Lego Movie fans will find this set a winner.</p>

"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-12-15T13:53:43.073Z","‘Classic’ Spaceship comparison review","<p>When I got back into Lego, one of the first sets I bought was <em>70816-Benny&rsquo;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!</em> I&rsquo;ve been a fan of the Space theme since I got <em>885-Space Scooter</em> and <em>886-Space Buggy</em> as a kid.</p>

<p>The 2 largest spaceships I already owned were <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49541""><em>6986-Mission Commander</em> </a>from the Space Police subtheme, and <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49542""><em>6973-Deep Freeze Defender</em> </a>from the Ice Planet 2002 subtheme, and I&rsquo;m going to review all three with a particular eye on comparing the differences between the 2 older sets and the newer one.</p>

<p>While only a little larger in physical dimensions, 70816 has more pieces than both of the other 2 sets combined. Modern sets do seem to use a lot more small pieces to build up the larger structures, but they also seem to have a lot more detail and features than the older sets.</p>

<p>As for the instructions, 70816 comes with 2 booklets with a total of 152 pages which is more than 4 times as many pages as the instructions for the other 2 set combined. Modern instructions give a parts list for each step which does make it much easier to build the set. 70816 averages around 7 pieces added per page of instructions, compared to 25 to 30 pieces per page for the 2 older sets.</p>

<p>Modern sets also come with the pieces divided into multiple bags, divided for the stages of the construction. Set 70816 has 7 larger bags, some of which contain smaller bags with small pieces inside.&nbsp; When I built this for the first time I dispensed with this helpful feature and emptied out all the bags into a large pile of pieces. The noise of rattling pieces made by hands sifting through them for particular bits is a part of the whole experience from my memory.</p>

<p>Benny&rsquo;s Spaceship is truly a classic spaceship, using the traditional colour scheme of &lsquo;light&rsquo; grey (medium stone grey these days) and bright blue, with transparent yellow canopies, and small details in bright yellow, transparent red and transparent green.</p>

<p>There are a moderate number of stickers to apply (no stickers in the classic days), but there are also several printed parts, including slopes with the classic space logo, and 2 bricks with LL929 labels.</p>

<p>The play features are also impressive, extending wings to reveal a set of spring shooters, a second different set of shooters on the not quite detachable Unikitty saucer section, which lifts up to reveal a work station area below, and flick missiles under the front wings. There are also 2 detachable mini flyers on each of the main wings. The whole thing is very swooshable.</p>

<p>There is also a large enough area at the back for Metalbeard (from set <em>70807</em>) to stand, as seen in the movie when they&rsquo;re escaping from Lord Businesses tower.</p>

<p>The bad guy is a Robo Pilot, and he gets a mini flyer in black, and a fancy gun, (he&rsquo;s better off than the Blacktron guy in 6986!)</p>

"danbailey","2016-10-04T23:51:19.11Z","""You're Really Letting the Air Out of My Tanks!""","<p>As an AFOL who came up with sets like the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6929-1/Star-Fleet-Voyager"">Star Fleet Voyager</a> (6929), <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6980-1/Galaxy-Commander"">Galaxy Commander</a> (6980), and had the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6973-1/Deep-Freeze-Defender"">Deep Freeze Defender</a> (6973) during my first stint as an AFOL, I&#39;ve been longing for a large-scale Space-themed spaceship. &nbsp;After seeing The Lego Movie with my kids, I spent a long time longing for&nbsp;Benny&#39;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP! -- when I found it on clearance for $19, I jumped all over it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Seven bags and a ton of stickers -- elsewhere in these reviews, I&#39;ve groused about stickers in lieu of screen-printed parts. &nbsp;I&#39;m willing to overlook it. &nbsp;Big box. &nbsp;Would&#39;ve been great to have the inside be the clear plastic tray with the round sections like the classic Space kits did back in the day. &nbsp;Can&#39;t have everything, I guess. &nbsp;Two instructions books, and this time I won&#39;t complain about it -- the build is complex enough to require two separate books.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Just like opening an old Space kit, only with more parts, and a few windscreen pieces that weren&#39;t there before. &nbsp;I was in heaven.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The listing says seven minifigs, but I don&#39;t like to count the robots or Princess Unikitty, due to them just being built out of &quot;standard&quot; parts. &nbsp;Benny, Wyld Style, and Emmett are all obvious inclusions in this kit and are great. &nbsp;My big beef with the &quot;non&quot;-minifigs are that they fall apart incredibly easily. &nbsp;Both robots constantly seem to have their arms falling off, something I don&#39;t remember from my first experiences with them in the 80&#39;s. &nbsp;And Princes Unikitty&#39;s head is constantly falling off -- also annoying.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is great fun -- it&#39;s not excessively complicated, but it also takes quite a bit of time, which is great. &nbsp;I get to shut off my brain and just follow instructions. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Huge, huge, huge. &nbsp;But also has some fragility issues. &nbsp;While the front and middle of the ship are durable/beefy, the back portion is ridiculously fragile/not well thought-out. &nbsp;The first set of vertical stabilizers with the engines atop them fall off their mounts when you just brush against them, and the wings come off pretty easily and aren&#39;t especially easy to re-attach.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this kit for the nostalgia, the reusability of all the parts, that you can quote Benny&#39;s lines from the movie constantly (see also: the title of this review), and it&#39;s great for display. &nbsp;I can&#39;t give it five stars because the playability is low -- stopping play every 2-5 minutes to reattach something is going to frustrate the heck out of most kids. &nbsp;My older son has the same kit and frequently complains about it. &nbsp;Still, I&#39;m extremely happy with it for the price I paid, and would&#39;ve paid full price happily.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Model is very sleek and swooshable for an adult. An amazing set full of great ideas and innovative touches. Initially i thought I would take it apart to build my own spaceships but i think i might get another set to do that. Will keep 1 copy in this form. Although i did some small modifications, mainly to swap grey parts to blue parts, as i think more blue looks nicer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are all very cool. The black baddie spaceship is small and cute, nothing too special, but kids will love it. Very swooshable for them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope LEGO comes out with a Blacktron 1 homage model soon. That would be amazing.&nbsp;</p>

Thanks Benny.","<p>As an owner of the original &#39;Spaceship&#39; the Space Cruiser and Moon base this was a must have so I bought it for my 6yo Son which is close to the 7yo I was when I was given the Space Cruiser for Xmas in 1979.</p>

<p>i got my old Space Cruiser set&nbsp;out from my display cabinet and had it right next us with the Lego movie playing on the Tv whilst we built this set. It was a most memorable experience.</p>

<p>i thought it was going to an ok build but it turned out to be so much more than anticipated. It really is quiet big with plenty of compartments and movable features. I do however agree with some previous reviews when it comes to playability. It is prone to breaking so durability is less than desired. But easy to put back together though.</p>

<p>Seven minifigs on box is misleading. Only have four plus two robots and the Cat which are all built using regular pieces. Rather disceiving that one I&#39;m affraid.</p>

<p>So in final Build was excellent, Is good value for money as set is quiet big, Is not the most playable set but is still fun flying (pretending)&nbsp;both this and my Space Cruiser around and it now rests right next to my Space Cruiser in my cabinet. Which by the way my two kids can excess and play with any set at any time. Cause as I have told them &quot;If it breaks you just have fun putting it back together&quot;.</p>

<p>Playability - It swooshes well enough. :-) It has stuff to shoot :-) it has a little baddy spaceship and minifig to fight. It&#39;s great fun. You need many Super Secret Police sets to deal with this bad boy.</p>

<p>Value for money - Not brilliant, but its got minifigs, Lucy looks cool in her classic space tracksuit, I like Benny but and unbroken version of his helmet would be nice to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I think anyone can enjoy one and I love this set enough to have two.</p>

<p>Not too great for playability, and more for display. It tends to fall apart from moving and playing.&nbsp; The (Mostly) exclusive Minifigs&nbsp;are amazing. Would I recommend&nbsp;this,</p>

"mwerle","2022-07-05T15:14:11.57Z","Awesome finished build, but build itself so-so","<p>First the good stuff: the finished spaceship is AWESOME! Playability is great, with many different features such as opening cockpits/engineering room, 2 undockable mini-ships, and several missiles.&nbsp; The only marginal negative here is that it&#39;s not really possible to pick the ship up from the top as there aren&#39;t really any vertical sides.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a small enemy spacecraft included, and a total of 4 minifigs (Robot-Emmet, Space-Wyldstyle, Benny, and a robot Pilot), and one LEGO-pieces figure (Astrokitty).</p>

<p>So lots of playability.</p>

<p>It looks pretty good from the top-side, the underside is very underwhelming and LEGO could definitely have tidied that up a bit and added some landing gear etc. Closer inspection does reveal some holes and gaps due to the reliance on technic pieces for the construction, which don&#39;t result in a solid build. Solid in the sense of no gaps, the ship itself is very solid from a construction perspective.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to mention, it also has a very strong connection to classic space as far as it&#39;s overall theme and looks go, which is really awesome (and the main reason I bought it as soon as I found out that it existed) for people like me who played with classic LEGO Space as kids. It certainly wouldn&#39;t look out-of-place in a Classic Space collection.</p>

<p>Now to the (IMHO) not-so-good:</p>

<p>The build itself was quite fiddly, with a huge reliance on technic and tiny pieces. This may be the new building style, but it is worlds apart from classic sets which is all I&#39;ve owned up to now. Not a particular fan of this building style. In particular I absolutely hated having to apply stickers. Due to mutual attraction, they tended to &quot;jump&quot; onto a piece before I could align it properly, so had quite a few which I had to try to peel off and try again, overall leading to a less-than-great result.</p>

<p>The construction relying on many tiny parts and leaving lots of holes also means playing with this set is probably restricted to &quot;clean&quot; environments. I used to take my LEGO classic space outside and play in the sand/dirt with them; apart from the fact I&#39;ve slightly outgrown that, I couldn&#39;t see kids doing the same with this set as dirt would just get into every crevasse.</p>

<p>I also can&#39;t really see myself disassembling the ship to try to build MOC&#39;s from it. It&#39;s a very specific build and I can&#39;t intuitively see how one could build something else form the components which would look and play well. This might just be me though - like I alluded, this is my first modern LEGO set, so people who are used to these building mechanics might have a different view here.</p>

<p>So in summary, great finished item, but IMHO not such a great build. Would like to hear others&#39; thoughts.</p>
