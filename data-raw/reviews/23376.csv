The Batwing actually took a little while to find at my local stores, of course I had forgotten that I&#39;d gotten one for free from my local TRU&nbsp;with a promotion. One set I actually don&#39;t mind having a couple of! Here&#39;s why:</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard Polybag, but with a pretty neat looking image of the finished model firing a flick missle. I really like the dark blue background they use in the line of polybags&nbsp;for Batman, they are quite smart looking. And of course anything with Batman in the corner with a Batarang in my book is A-OK.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always disliked the little square sheets you unfold for the instructions in a Polybag, but until they switch to a stapled booklet (which will probably never happen), you make do with what you got!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A good mix of different triangular plates make up the bulk of the 45 pieces included in this set. I was surprised to find that it even had a tecnic pin to facilitate a firey&nbsp;engine exhaust. You can never had enough flick missles said no one ever, but it has a few of the rounded ends instead of the more common translucent cones, so they get a pass on that.</p>

<p>I do want to point out that there&#39;s a neat half-arch used in the nose of the plane that is a 2x2 instead of the usual 1x2, which I&#39;ve not seen in any sets that I own that I can think of.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigures, but as it&#39;s a mini-build that&#39;s expected.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very straight forward, though it did get slightly hard to figure out what&#39;s next as everything is the same colour more or less and it blends together. The instructions are just the small square fold-out kind that are normal for polybags, so as such it doesn&#39;t have the oh-so-helpful legend of what parts you need per step. With all the black it&#39;s confusing on what goes where. Looking back at the last step will help compare what&#39;s old and what&#39;s new as you go along.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I wasn&#39;t expecting a whole lot from the model as it looks quite small and flimsy at the start, but it is actually pretty solid and is easily one of the most swooshable&nbsp;builds I&#39;ve made in a while. Call is the modern style that the Batwing has had since it was introduced in the comics, the fact that it&#39;s in a stylish colour, or just that Batman is pretty awesome, this Batwing is a great little build and a fantastic way to spend a few minutes.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>You can&#39;t beat the price of a Polybag, and you can&#39;t beat the value you get in a little build with neat pieces. Even better if you got it free like I did while picking up some of the newer DC Super Heroes sets earlier this year!</p>

<p>As a starter set for a Batman fan or even as a palate cleanse before delving into a bigger model, this is an awesome piece that will look all the better next to the Tumbler! Multiply the epic-factor tenfold by setting it up next to your pens at your desk :)</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>1) Design is quite impressive, using an overall larger piece count this Polybag makes a big chunky looking Batwing complete with flick-fire missiles adding more to the play value.</p>

<p>2) Fun to swoosh around, the Batwing looks like a squat black bat almost perfectly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>1) The nose is a bit long, the length of the front section isn&#39;t as short as it should be. Though when dealing with micro-scaled polybag builds I suppose that is to be expected.</p>

<p>2) No printed bat symbols, the Tumbler didn&#39;t need anything like that, and even if it had been stickered 1x2 tiles instead of prints the Batwing should have at least had one symbol on it somewhere, it&#39;s such an iconic part of the most familiar iteration of the Batwing and the mythos a symbol couldn&#39;t have hurt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this polybag is well worth the effort of tracking down, once again it&#39;s a fun little impulse buy great as a desk toy and just fun to fly around for any age. Some parts of the design may take getting used to, like with many micro-scaled vehicles, however it is definitely something I&#39;d recommend for fans of the vehicle, or polybags in general. If you were lucky enough to get last year&#39;s Batmobile polybag this completes the three iconic vehicles in this scale also.</p>
