"goldenguy880","2014-06-20T00:47:34.76Z","Super Secret Police Inforcer","<p>I recently went to my local Target store in hopes of picking up a few of the new <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Mixels/year-2014"">Mixels</a> sets, and was disappointed to find that they were not yet in stock. Not wishing to leave empty-handed, I grabbed this polybag at the last minute from the checkout area. Below are my thoughts regarding the set.</p>

<h3>Packaging/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set is packaged in a polybag, with an image of the model against a Lego Movie-styled background which I presume to be Bricksburg, with The Lego Movie filmstrip branding in the corner. accompanied by text containing further information, consisting of the age suggestion (which I largely ignored when buying the set), the item number, and last but not least, the set name. Needless to say, this format is the normal for most polybag sets and is nothing new.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Given its size, this set contains a fair selection of black and white pieces. There is nothing extremely exciting here, but some of the parts have potential to be useful for other builds. Some that caught my eye include the two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4547489"">white double cheese slopes</a>, the four <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4632566"">white lamp holders</a>, the two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4541191"">black lattice roof tiles</a>, the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4143875"">black 2X2 front piece</a>, the two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6037746"">Black 1X4 bows</a>, the two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4211063"">black 1X2 plates</a>, and finally, the two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/73587"">black joystick levers</a>. You can never have too many of these.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The solitary minifigure of this set is, according to bricklink, the <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/tlm046/Robo-SWAT-with-Helmet"">Robo SWAT with Helmet</a>. the printing design on this figure is excellent, being detailed and accurate to its source material. His rifle, as noted before, is similar to the tranquilizer rifles from the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Dino"">Dino</a> theme, but varies slightly, and is a neat accessory. The versatility of this minifigure is my favorite aspect, however, with a simple hand and head swap transforming him into a relatively generic Swat Police officer, and I can also see myself using his rifle, hips, hands, head, and possibly his helmet in some sci-fi themed minifigures. My only issue is that the printed Super Secret Police badge printed on the helmet is slightly off-centered on the minifigure I got, but I hope that this is a solitary issue (as the printing on the package art minifigure&#39;s helmet is centered perfectly). I have also had the same problem with the printing on <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/lor014/Boromir"">Boromir&#39;s</a> shield from <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9473-1/The-Mines-of-Moria""><span>9473: </span> The Mines of Moria</a>. Have you ever experienced this?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As can be expected, the build of this set is nothing exciting, although it was nice to see the smooth shape come together. I also liked the use of <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4124096"">2X2 rockers</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/393701"">1X2 rocker bearings</a>, and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4547489"">double cheese slopes</a> to achieve the angled, er, things on the sides.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed set has a satisfyingly sleek design, and is &#39;swooshable&#39;. I also appreciate the inclusion of a &#39;hands-on&#39; control system(the use levers or handlebars instead of a computer screed), which is <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70701-1/Swarm-Interceptor""><span>all</span></a> <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/5983-1/Undercover-Cruiser""><span>too</span></a> <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7669-1/Anakin-s-Jedi-Starfighter""><span>often</span></a> <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8017-1/Darth-Vader-s-TIE-Fighter""><span>neglected</span></a>. I would have liked to see two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4504382"">black cheese slopes</a> on top of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4211111"">dark gray 1X2 technic brick</a> to make it look less rough, but this can be very easily added to the finished set(if you have the two cheese slopes!).</p>

<h3>Playabillity</h3>

<p>As can be expected, the main points of playabillity are in placing and removing the Robo SWAT in the seat, and in &#39;swooshing&#39; the ship around. However, I have different expectations for a boxed set and a polybag set, so this is fine.</p>

<h3>Value for money</h3>

<p>At a &#39;pocket money&#39; retail price of $5.99, this set is worth picking up if you see it. However, only being released at retail in the US and as a promotional item in the UK, our friends across the pond might be looking at a price of about $10.00/&pound;6.40 on eBay. I would not recommend paying much more than the retail price unless you are a collector of The Lego Movie sets or <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/4779/confessions-of-a-serial-polybag-collector-%E2%80%93-part-1"">a collector of polybags</a>.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set has a rather nice model, a great minifigure, and some useful pieces, and could easily complement a larger The Lego Movie set. There is the bare look on the technic brick I mentioned earlier, but for a polybag set, I&#39;m not complaining. There is also the off-center helmet printing, but I imagine that it is hard for a machine to print designs onto a rounded objects such as this and keep it perfectly straight. To conclude, I can easily recommend this set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-09-22T01:11:41.07Z","Robo-SWAT Army","<p><strong>Set # 30282 Super Secret Police Enforcer: </strong>A great little polybag that allows you to build a fun little model and a small army of Robo-SWAT Mini-Figures.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Mini-Figure is generic and perfect for an army builder.</li>
	<li>The model is a fun little speeder type build that we saw briefly in the film during the Super Cycle Chase. The build is simple, quick and easy.</li>
	<li>Make great fun little add-ons for the Police Dropship or Bad Cop Cruiser in display.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Doesn&#39;t include the Robo-SWAT vest piece. (Ok I&#39;m reaching here, honestly there isn&#39;t much bad about this set.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend hunting down a bunch of these for your LEGO Movie collection, unlike the other Polybag sets from the film it works as an awesome little army builder set. It&#39;s also really fun and makes a perfect impulse buy.</p>
