"Slobrojoe","2020-04-07T10:57:15.21Z","A really 'Micro' manager","<p>The Lego Movie came out in 2014 and, since then, we have had some amazing builds, a video game,&nbsp;6 poly bags and a whole CMF series, not to mention a just as popular sequel. One of President Business&#39; henchmen were&nbsp;the &#39;Micromanagers&#39;. These robots are featured in 8 different sets including this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Quick note from the author (me):&nbsp;</em>this is the first time that I have reviewed with pictures and hopefully not the last. As a poly bag, I thought it might be a good start. My photography isn&#39;t the best, so please excuse some minor details on the image. I took all of the photos.</p>

<h3>Packaging/instructions:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set comes in a rectangular poly bag, with some nice artwork on the front.</p>

<p>The instructions are&nbsp;a double-sided leaflet with&nbsp;reasonably easy to follow steps and no errors/misprints. There is no piece inventory.</p>

<h3>Parts:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>27 pieces are used to make this set, with 4 spare ones. The spare ones include a translucent&nbsp;red stud, a grey lever, a white stud&nbsp;and&nbsp;a&nbsp;black droid arm. All together, there are 31 pieces. None of the pieces are exclusive and the rarest piece in the set is Wyldstyle&#39;s hair piece, which can only be found in 5 other sets. We also see a red 2X2 brick, which seems a little obscure for a build of mainly dark colours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifig:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The minifig is composed of 5 parts. These are included in the total&nbsp;piece count. The hood comes in a small, non-recyclable plastic bag. The head&nbsp;is double-sided.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49743148763_18c4206eee_o.jpg"" style=""width: 400px; height: 175px;"" /></p>

<p>The hair piece is a really nice shape and is mostly black, except the front 2 strands, which are light blue and purple. It curves around her facial features perfectly. On one side of her face, you can see small freckles and pink lips that turn up in the corner. On the other side, she is squin ting with a very serious and stoic expression. Her hood piece is a type of&nbsp;rubbery, black&nbsp;plastic. Inside the hood, there is a purple lining. My only problem with the&nbsp;hood is that dust is&nbsp;quite pronounced.&nbsp;Her torso shows some open skin, and then moves on to a silver zip. There is some sort of purple and light blue graffiti/paintwork on the left hand side of her jacket. The graffiti caries on to her left arm and back. Finally, the legs carry on the bright blue and purple graffiti, until about the knee on a human, when it becomes black. Then it carries on on her left foot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her weapons are buildable nunchucks, made out of 2 telescope pieces and a small chain piece.</p>

<h3>Build:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The build&nbsp;is&nbsp;very&nbsp;simple, taking a maximum of 2 minutes. The red 2X2 brick I talked about earlier is used as the main structure for the Micro Manager.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49743695596_7ea4d3bcc8_o.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 316px;"" />&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed Model:</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49743146683_2e8ca1391c_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 118px;"" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49743145258_3367558d20_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 103px;"" /></p>

<p>The completed model looks pretty good for the 22 pieces used in it. The octagonal bar piece helps the black droid arms to clip on and the middle one on each side holds a tool. The lever on top adds really nice detail and the grill makes it look relatable to the movie. The translucent red stud on top of the white stud adds a really menacing look. My only big problem with the entire set is that&nbsp;there is no detail on the back or sides of the Micro Manager. A couple of grills could sort this problem.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion:</h3>

<p>This is a great set. There is only one flaw (in my eyes) in the whole set, and a pretty much perfect minifig. The lack of any unique or rare parts and the lack of detail on the sides and back of the model. All in all, I have given the set a 4 out of 5. I recommend this set to any fan of LEGO, despite age or interests, because it is a jolly good set!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my first picture&nbsp;review. If you thought it was helpful, and want me to keep on making this type of review, please give the review a good rating. Once again, I apologise&nbsp;for the quality of the images.</p>
