<p>For the build it is small (with only 40 pieces). &nbsp;It should only take a couple minutes. &nbsp;Plus their is some repetition&nbsp;with&nbsp;he legs / &nbsp;mouth parts, but that is only eight times. &nbsp;As for the accessories&nbsp;it come with one &quot;Chima&nbsp;Crystal&quot; &nbsp;and two &quot;guns&quot; (which is not pictured on the front of the package, just the one &quot;gun&quot;). &nbsp;Speaking of &quot;guns&quot; attached to the &quot;bug&quot; they look like exhaust ports or mufflers, to me at least. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Why did I get this? &nbsp;For one I wanted another &quot;Spider Tribe Member&quot; and no one else. &nbsp;Second, it was only $4. &nbsp;Third, I am thinking it is going to disappear&nbsp;soon. &nbsp;I guess, I should tell you where I got this from a store called &quot;Meijer&quot;. &nbsp;(It is based out of&nbsp;the Great&nbsp;Lakes&nbsp;area.) &nbsp;</p>

<p>So if you like spiders or bugs and / or Chima, it is a good little set to get. I am not sure what kind of &quot;special promotion&quot; this set might of go with like a &quot;holiday time sale&quot;. &nbsp;(But, like I said earlier I do not think it will be around to much longer. &nbsp;Six months max, I am guessing. &nbsp;From the supplies I have seen.) &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Not Entirely.","<p><strong>Set # 30263 Spider Crawler: </strong>Gotta love a polybag from LEGO that gives us a spider tribe Minifigure and a neat little mech vehicle build for you to enjoy. So let&rsquo;s go on to the pros and cons of this one.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Spider Crawler build is a fun and simple little build that works as a spider tribe speedy thief vehicle. I can see a load of these racing across the plains of Chima to snatch the Chi crystals from the Lion Tribe Temple. It also looks like a nice little spider mech too.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Sparratus minifigure is awesome, love the double-sided torso print with webbing armor and the leg printing, head piece is awesome too. Includes a single-sided facial print and a Chi crystal for accessory.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>No weapons for Sparratus.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Also missing spider legs for Sparratus&rsquo; minifigure&rsquo;s back.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall this polybag is an awesome little stocking stuffer for the holidays if you haven&rsquo;t picked it up, and makes for a great army builder set for making a small army of spider walker mechs to go with the larger Spider based vehicle. Highly recommended.</p>
