Even the Polybags have some great looking micro models that they can use in their quest for Chi, or the battle for Chi, or anything else that may be involved in your play pattern.</p>

<p>Gorzan&#39;s Walker is a small mini-mech similar to the Galaxy Force Polybag, though not in build, simply in the look of it. It has two legs, a central torso, and two small arms that end in energy blasters. Using mostly dark brown and gray coloured pieces the minature mech does it&#39;s best to represent the animal tribe employing it.</p>

<p>The Gorzan Mini-Figure is chalk full of detail, with a double-sided torso print, leg printing, printing on the gorilla head mask and a double-sided facial print. One side being all smiles and happiness, the other showing a snarling, angry expression. He doesn&#39;t include any accessories besides the Chi Crystal. You don&#39;t get any weapons, or armour for him to wear. However the detail on this figure is still high quality standard, what I&#39;ve come to expect from the Theme and the head mask piece is a nice looking gorilla head different from the CMF head in series 3.</p>

<p>Overall this is a winning Polybag, it&#39;s got a great character included with it and has a nifty looking designed build I recommend it for fans of this Theme and polybags as well as Legends of Chima mini-figures. A small army of them never hurt anybody. And the base parts from the model could be used to MOC a medium sized mech if you wanted to get creative, since it does include some of the ball and socket joints.</p>
