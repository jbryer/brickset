<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Polybag/Instructions* - the set comes in a quite big polybag (17x19 cm) - and a single page, double printed instruction manual is included.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A total of 45 pieces (excluding&nbsp;spare parts).</p>

<p>No printed parts.</p>

<p>1 spare part - Round plate&nbsp;1x1 Br.Blue (&quot;R2-D2&quot;)</p>

<p>Notable parts: Light blue transplanted 1x1 round plate (x2). Med St-Grey Plate W. Bow 1x2x2/3 (x2). Med St-Grey Flag with 2 holders (x4).</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The set contains no minifigures. Would be nice, but unrealistic.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Quick and easy. The main hull/cockpit was the most fun and easiest to build. After that you will have to build the wings, which are quite the same.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Looks alright, no printed pieces or stickers for extra details. R2-D2&nbsp;is found at the left wing. The engines at the back is a good detail.</p>

<p>Lightweight and small for playability, the &quot;big wings&quot; can be moved with clicks and the four outer wings can move, but not completely down like the real deal.&nbsp;It&nbsp;also takes good part as display model.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>The price of this set&nbsp;is so low, that any LEGO&nbsp;Star Wars fan should be able to pick it up. Nothing that will destroy your economy, worth it - for the collection.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T14:25:34.147Z","Small Jedi Fun","<p><strong>Set #30244 Anakin&rsquo;s Jedi Interceptor: </strong>This is another great little polybag capturing the likeness of the Starfighter in question. Unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t very ideal for troop building, nevertheless you&rsquo;ll still find some great fun out of it and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Dark green and grey colour scheme looks very sharp and contrasts nicely.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Main build is fun and fast making a great little model to play around with, use different coloured parts from your collection to create a small army of Jedi Starfighters.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Represents a version of this vehicle rarely seen in LEGO form, will work well for a Brickfilm.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>No studs for Astromech Domes, as is common with most of these Starfighter polybags who use Astromechs.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No printed elements, small flag/wings are plain and cockpit has no printed aspects to it, which is unfortunate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Piece count is less than you might expect for the price of this set. Adding more pieces wouldn&rsquo;t have improved the model though so this con is more dependent on your thoughts for this type of set.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I love this little polybag and strongly recommend it as a fun interpretation of the Jedi Interceptor. The colours really add to the value of this set and the dark green pieces are not too common. If you can still find this I suggest nabbing it before it&rsquo;s too late.</p>
