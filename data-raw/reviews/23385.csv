"alexfig8","2014-06-17T01:40:38.943Z","Awesome little polybag!","<p>I bought this set yesterday at Toys R Us in the US. &nbsp;It cost $3.49 and was the only polybag set they had at the time, besides Mixels. &nbsp;I was immediately drawn to it because it is rather unique and was about $1.50 cheaper than the usual polybag price of $4.99. &nbsp;Now, onto the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just a simple polybag. &nbsp;The bag shows the set well enough, with the lift itself on the side of the road with the minifigure fixing something that we cannot see. &nbsp;The instructions are just a sheet with two sides. &nbsp;Nothing too complicated here. &nbsp;Also, since I am from the US, the bag states it has 40 pieces, unlike the picture of the bag above.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Once again, nothing too amazing. &nbsp;Another wrench is nice to have, as is the bucket the figure stands in. &nbsp;I have never seen that part in gray before, only white. &nbsp;The yellow wheels are useful as well, they generally only appear in construction/mining sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Just one, a fairly generic construction worker fig. &nbsp;His head is newer, I believe it is from the mining subtheme of last year. &nbsp;His accessories include a wrench and a small control panel, which I assume controls the lift.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty fast, nothing too complex as far as techniques go. &nbsp;Nothing really to say about it other than fairly enjoyable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final product exceeded my expectations greatly. &nbsp;I assumed it would be a lot smaller, but it can actually extend kinda far. &nbsp;The set is very useful in any sort of city layout, and can be paired with a lot of sets. &nbsp;In fact, I&#39;ve noticed many sets in the City line now include light fixtures on the outside or lamp posts. &nbsp;Besides a 2010 set, there has been nothing really to repair these. &nbsp;This set fills that gap nicely. &nbsp;Also works well for another construction vehicle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fantastic set, you should totally go buy it. &nbsp;I&#39;m thinking about buying another for my layouts! &nbsp;Thanks for reading!</p>

"The_Brick_Station","2014-07-25T04:29:36.95Z","Small, acceptable Polybag","<p>This set is overall a good polybag, and it would be useful in a city, but for playing... Well, read on.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The polybag&nbsp;looks okay, but it is a City set, and the City line is not famous for box art. Instructions fold out.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has some useful pieces, such as the container on top and the 1x3 curved slopes in yellow...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure is awfully generic, with very easily attainable&nbsp;parts. It would have been nice to get a more detailed construction worker like in the LEGO Movie.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is just meh. It looks like some sort of ATV when you look at it closely. But from a distance it looks fine for a lift.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The minifig and model together clash okay, but as mentioned about the minifigure, it would be nice for it to include more design.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this polybag is a nice little build to add to your city.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:36:07.817Z","Time for Repairs.","<p><strong>Set #30229 Repair Lift: </strong>LEGO City Polybags are pretty much miniature additions to the larger sets. They are often just more microbuild police and fire vehicles, however there are a few nice ones that have been made in recent years. And this is one of the nicer unique ones, let&rsquo;s cover why this set is one you should track down.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Nice unique looking vehicle design not seen before in LEGO City Polybags.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Construction Worker Minifigure has a nice simple look to him. Facial print will be a big hit with fans of Breaking Bad, print will make some AFOL MOCers pretty happy.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Basket piece unique and has many great uses.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Finished model looks nice and solid, and the instructions are simple and fun.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Accessories are limited, wrench not unique, and control panel for repair lift is an odd printed tile choice which looks different and not what you&rsquo;d expect here.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Piece count on the smaller side for LEGO City Polybags.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall while I do still recommend this set I caution you that the price per piece ratio may be slightly higher than desirable. Also the minifigure isn&rsquo;t unique to this set and his print is fairly simple, while that might not be a bad thing, it does mean when you buy multiples of this you won&rsquo;t get much use out of the minifigure as a clone build. Though it does mean you get a good torso for building up your City collection.</p>

<p>The next polybag I&rsquo;m reviewing is a much more satisfying addition to your City collection though.</p>
