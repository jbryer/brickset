<p>There was nothing special about the set and I already have a few police helicopters but who would miss a set and a minifigure for this price?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Polybag / Easy instructions, 12 steps</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are of the usual good shiny quality, extra leftover parts are: 1 helmet visor (grey), 1 gearstick (white/black), 1 round lamp (yellow), 1 flat lamp (blue)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The police officer/pilot is nice with belt, badge and pocket, the face is a normal smiling face with eyebrows.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was easy, maybe too easy and quick but what to expect from a polybag, right?</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Nice little model, however I couldn&#39;t help but turn the front light inside out, I think it looks much better.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Easy build, thanks to the two blue pieces in the rear it&#39;s easy to hold when playing.</p>
