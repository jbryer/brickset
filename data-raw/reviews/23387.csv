<p>Let&rsquo;s go on to the pros and cons of this polybag before we finish with the overall thoughts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Solid colour choices of dark blue and red with white and light stone grey mixed in. Pieces aren&rsquo;t too rare, but look great and can be used for other builds if you so choose.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Main model build looks similar to some of the Creator Microbuild Helicopters, however remains unique. Design looks great and is fun to play with.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Vertical Take-off and Landing feature is included in such a small build, awesome design choice and works great.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Instructions serviceable for a polybag</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>None really to speak of in this build.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Honestly I think this is a stand out Creator Polybag, the build looks great and is great fun to play with or just have for a desk toy. I strongly recommend this one to fans of the polybags LEGO offers. Many of the Creator Polybags rarely suffer much, and this is one where I honestly didn&rsquo;t find anything wrong with it. Again strongly recommended.</p>
