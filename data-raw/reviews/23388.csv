<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Imaginative build using many sloped pieces to replicate the kitty look.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Instructions are easy to follow, like most polybags.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Moveable limbs use Technic pins to rotate.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completed model is cute and cuddly looking, blocky kitty is fun looking and merges medium and light stone grey colours with white to make a solid looking kitty build.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Not a fan of the choice for whiskers on this kitty build, sadly not many alternative pieces for that are available.</li>
	<li>Big blocky head makes kitty model top heavy when legs are in different poses.</li>
	<li>Tail build has visible studs, not a problem for me, other builders may not enjoy this aesthetic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I suspect many of you will enjoy this set, there may be a few of you that aren&rsquo;t a fan of the mini animal builds from polybags. Or feel that this model is too chunky to be truly cute; however I find the model to be serviceable for what it&rsquo;s attempting. It&rsquo;s a nice looking model that could have used the newer ball joints in a much more poseable kitty, if you&rsquo;d prefer to MOC one then why not try it.</p>

<p>Still a strong offering from Creator, I think it&rsquo;s much more solid compared to the Eagle that I never managed to find in my area. So I recommend this to fans of Creator Polybags and Polybags in general.</p>
