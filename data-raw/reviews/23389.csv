No Pros or Cons here, or long speeches about the numerous different elements, we&#39;ll just get right on to an overview.</p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">As creator sets go this isn&#39;t bad, it&#39;s not great or anything, but it could be worse. The Fast Car is a quick build using your standard parts. It rolls quite nicely and the colour combination looks pretty good, I suppose the only thing wrong with it is the pieces chosen for the windshield, they don&#39;t match very well with the rest of the model.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">For Polybag enthusiasts I&#39;d say this is one you&#39;re going to want, for parents this makes a great little checkout impulse buy and the car is very playable, even the spoiler can be angled anyway you want. Unless you&#39;re really into Creator builds of this scale I&#39;d say you&#39;d be better off getting a polybag with a mini-figure or two in it. Mildly recommended.</font></p>
