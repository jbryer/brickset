It's really cool how the legs can move back and forth. The odd thing is, on the side of the legs, there are 2 boxes for holding something. This is amazing. 10/10!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The first thing you notice is the long arms and short legs it has. It's just kind of disproportional, but you get used to it. It has storage boxes on the legs, but doesn't come with anything to put in them, and the legs/waist are attached by only 4 studs and so the legs fall off a lot. The feet are sort of badly designed, and so it falls over backwards often. I suggest adding parts on the feet to prevent this. Other than that, it has some nice transparent pieces like the blades and lots of lights. I was disappointed by the lack of weapons, it's a mech with no guns! So I added some stuff, and now it's perfect.

Overall, it's great, but nothing worth seeking out in particular. Go ahead and buy it if you find a deal.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The little submarine is very cool and has a camera for those secret missions. This is a great set overall and is one of the best Alpha Team sets ever made!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jjr","2009-04-13T05:45:18.467Z","most impressive set","I got this set from my grandparents at my birthday, I was really happy with it because I liked alpha team so much.  on to the pros and cons

pros

shark, teevee, big and cool looking robot and we get dash, a very rare fig at that time
if fun to play with, it's like a bigger version of 4790

cons

very easy build, like most sets at that time
the visor of dash on the box shows a dive helmet thing, however in the set he gets a normal blue visor
wierd walking, 
I wish they made the windows transparant blue so it would still match the orginal color scheme of alpha team

overal this is the best alpha team set I can remember,",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
