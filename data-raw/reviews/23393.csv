<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like in the two magazines before there is no box but a foil package which can be opened and closed again because of a glue stripe. A very nice idea especially for collectors, since the package won&#39;t get damaged. Instructions are not included and also not needed; it is easy to build this minifig.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You will get 13 parts, e.g. a clear-blue shield, a golden spear and a nice gorilla-hammer.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Six parts result in an armored minifig of Grumlo.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I told before: it is very easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>On the one hand it is just a minifig with weapons. But on the other hand you also have the magazine, so your child may increase its reading level easily, because it wants to read without discussing (I think this will please other parents, too).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This combination of the magazine and minifig is good for the children, the parents and of course the collectors. There is just one thing to say: get it!</p>

<p>It&#39;s packed in a nice packet, which strangely has wrong picture in background, but nevermind, it&#39;s easy to open and you can use it again.</p>

<p>You build him quite fast but using all those nice pieces it&#39;s an unique experience.</p>

<p>He&#39;s very detailed and comes with rare golden spear, hammer, armour and shield, and he has light gray hands!</p>

<p>So what are you waiting? Get him!</p>
