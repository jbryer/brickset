I was lucky enough to get my hands on this Star Wars polybag from a generous trade partner in the UK, which I believe is the only country it is currently available in, so I thought I might as well lay out my opinion of the figure...</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start from the top and move down:</p>

<p>The head, now in dark red for the first time, is the same unchanged protocol droid head mold as when LEGO Star Wars first began. Like all the other more recent protocol droids, it&#39;s large round eye sockets are printed with a bright whitish yellow color for a &#39;glowing&#39; effect, which really stands out on the dark piece. Also, there is a thin silver strip printed just above the small rectangular &#39;mouth&#39;, nice little detail there.</p>

<p>Now, for the torso. The printing on this piece is almost identical to other newer protocol droids, with the white, red, blue, and gold wires visible through the opening below the chest plate, and round&nbsp;charging socket in the center. the only noticeable difference is the silver trim printed outlining the body plates and and charging socket, which reflects quite nicely when hit by light! There is also printing on the back, with a pattern of wires similar to the front, and a rectangular shape printed on back plate at the top.</p>

<p>For the first time on a protocol droid, the legs are printed, which adds a lot of detail to the figure, but the print only extends down to the knees, which makes it look slightly incomplete, but that&#39;s only a minor complaint. there is also some silver print on both sides of each knee joint, and two small stripes at the top of the right leg.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Overall opinion</p>

<p>The first thing that came to mind upon opening it was that it was a bit lighter than the packaging suggested, but there is certainly nothing wrong with that. All thing considered, this is an excellent figure, certainly a must-have for any LEGO Star Wars or polybag&nbsp;collector. You decide what you are willing to pay for it, but I definitely recommend picking one up if you can!</p>

<p>Overall&nbsp;<strong>4.5 of 5&nbsp;</strong>due to the obscurity of this character I will knock off half a point, but it is a great figure! So, given a chance, don&#39;t hesitate to pick one up!</p>

"Asdirko","2020-08-03T20:37:53.513Z","Average","<p>Knowing that this is a pretty rare figure, and I am fortunate enough to have a copy, I thought I would share some opinions about this set to find out if it&#39;s worth adding to your Star Wars minifigure collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set was a limited giveaway at select stores, and I happened to get mine at a Star Wars event. The only place to get it know is the second hand market, such as Bricklink, so is it worth your money?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The minifigures is TC-4, a very little known character, though a very interesting one with its striking Dark Red color scheme. The head is exactly the same as C-3PO&#39;s though in a different color, with printed yellow eyes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Body is also reminiscent of C-3PO, with the large power coupler and exposed wires. It has dark red hands and is very nicely printed, capturing a&nbsp;protocol droids appearance nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is not a lot to say about the pants, just some printing to denote what looks like...kneepads? Though it is the similar to other protocols within the Star Wars universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Its a nice figure, in a new color that stands out among other protocols, though it does appear very much like a discolored C-3PO. It is a nice collectors peice, but honestly, doesn&#39;t give the excitement that other polybags have, such as Darth Revan. Other than that, it&#39;s an okay figure.&nbsp;</p>
