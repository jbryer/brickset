<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The standard Alpha Team border, with a little scene. Good setup. I remember there being a comic in the back, although there isn't one on Peeron.com.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The most notable part, of course, is the robot diver body. It's very odd, and has a large number of uses. The robot arms fit very nicely, as do the hands. The plant and the skeleton orb's canopy are also great parts.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Charge is very cool. He has many details that make his head a very nice piece, and his suit is also very detailed.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's very simple. There's a little attachment at the back of the robot, the putting-together of the arms, building the Skeleton Orb, and putting the two parts of the plant together.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It consists of the Robot Diver, a plant, and a Skeleton Orb. It's not particularly special, but it makes for a nice scene and is very ""playable"".<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>The set is a great little impulse. It wasn't perfect, but neither was it flawed. This set is worth a few dollars, and makes for a great army builder.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,5

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-26T09:28:11.377Z","Team Alpha Go!","<p>Set #4790 Alpha Team Robot Diver: Being a fan of new and interesting ideas I collected the Alpha Team sets (some of which I gave away to spread the LEGO love and open up more space in my display/collection for the newer items.) I however kept all of my Mission Deep Sea Sub-Theme sets because, despite being majorly aquaphobic I dig the submersible-verse of LEGO. Because you don't need water to enjoy a good submarine battle between Alpha Team and Ogel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little impulse set was one of the first I bought for the new Sub-Theme and I found it to be most enjoyable, despite being so small. It includes the Mini-Figure Charge (That is his name, right???), a miniature submersible robotic suit, a freaky skeleton head in a dome and of course a green undersea frond thing, so you know he's under the sea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building this set is simple and takes very little time, despite this it is still fun and there are many different ways to add onto this little robot thing with more parts from your collection. (I once used the extra parts from my other sets to give him really long mechanical arms to do battle against the Mutant Killer Whale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The little frond thing comes with a green circular plate so it can stand up, and of course the skeleton head is placed in the dome pictured to the left, I really liked the new skeleton head design for Alpha Team's sets and wouldn't mind if LEGO returned to useing that head for new evil skeletons or minions of another villain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a cheap and fun set and I give it an overall rating of four, with a playability factor of five due to the endless amount of fun you can dream up using this set. If you're looking to add some of the older underwater themed sets to your Atlantis collection you can't go wrong with Mission Deep Sea. If you can find it for a good price, buy this guy, then pit him against the enemies of Mission Atlantis, it can't hurt. The yellow coloring of his mech is also a nice contrast to the red of the Atlantis theme.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4

&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The main build of the set is what looks to be an aquatic exoskeleton with the Minifigure of the set standing up to pilot it. The build of the exosuit is really simple, using a prefab body that has some interesting leg printing.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Clicking on some levers for the controls, arms, and lights and what looks like a jetpack gives you the main build of the set. The MEK is also given some tool with a transparent green cone and a fire piece attached to it, perhaps to clear away debris.&nbsp; The set also comes with a side build of seaweed and a skull in a transparent green jar. I&#39;m not familiar with the storyline of Alpha Team, but I believe the main villain of the series, Ogel, is trying to collect the skulls for his nefarious deeds.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Minifigure of the set is named Charge.

The Minifigure is equipped with a dark gray diving helmet and a transparent blue visor.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

"omega64","2020-11-11T18:12:52.547Z","Diving into my first review","<p>I&#39;ve owned a fair few older sets across the years, including some alpha team ones, but this set was the first retired set that I bought sealed in the box... which I promptly opened. Yeah, I&#39;m one of those people. Anyway, the review:</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES</p>

<p>This set includes only one minifigure, that being Agent Charge. Considering the size of this set however, it&#39;s completely appropriate. His wetsuit includes some very detailed printing by 2002 standards, what with the intricately detailed utility belt and a mesh design peeking out under his collar. The face is similarly elaborate, although his expression is a little odd. To top him off, we have both hair and helmet pieces, a small bonus I was not expecting. Although, if this is deep sea, then I don&#39;t think a snorkel will be much use!</p>

<p>BUILDS</p>

<p>Despite having a mere 32 pieces, three builds are included, so let&#39;s go smallest to largest. We have a very simple build for some seaweed, which does the job well considering it only comprises 2 elements. Then we reach the source of danger for this mission, one of many ogel orbs. there&#39;s not much to it, with only 1 more part than the seaweed, but it really looks the part, with the excellent printed skull inside and the transparent green dome encasing it looking quite grimy and evil, as it should. Finally, we reach the main event, the pseudo mech suit, and despite the whole thing basically consisting of a sparse selection of parts attached to a big one piece frame, there&#39;s a lot to like. For example, the main body features sublime printing showing some tubing on a backdrop of warning stripes. But if that doesn&#39;t sell you, the arms definitely will. They&#39;re made of those technic hinges that give each joint a huge range of motion, allowing for all sorts of poses. Gripped in one of it&#39;s claws is a... Flamethrower? But how would that work underwater? Okay, lets just say it&#39;s a high tech, waterproof laser cutter and move on.</p>

<p>VALUE FOR MONEY</p>

<p>Going by the price sticker on my box, this would have originally set you back &pound;3, about a fiver nowadays. That&#39;s about double the price of a modern CMF, meaning this was a perfect impulse buy back in the day&nbsp;for those who wanted a taste of the theme without breaking the bank (Or more accurately, the pocket money). Today, you&#39;ll have to pay a bit more, especially if you want it MISB like I did. I snagged my copy for a fairly reasonable &pound;25 or so, but who knows what it&#39;s worth now? Prices on second hand sites fluctuate constantly, so all I can say on that is happy hunting!</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>Alpha Team is often ignored or passed off as one of many failed experiments lego tried during their infamous financial trouble. But I think it deserves so much more love than it&#39;s given. This set serves as a brilliant showcase for everything I find so enjoyable about the range: exquitisite printing, great playability and just this undefinable charm that keeps bringing me back to Alpha Team. As one of lego&#39;s first action oriented ips, it paved the way for so many of the themes we love today, like Agents, Ninjago, and even Monkie Kid to an extent. So yeah, very good set from a very good (And underrated) theme.</p>
