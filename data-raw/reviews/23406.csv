<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the typical type for the Architecture range, and I like them. &nbsp;Very smart and strong box. &nbsp;The instruction manual came in at around 140 pages in book form, with a few pages at the beginning giving a brief history of the fountain. &nbsp;I like the books from a presentation point of view, but it can be a bit fiddly when trying to keep the page open and fnd the parts you need. &nbsp;As it was, I managed to open the book a bit too much and break the binding near the back *sob*. &nbsp;The instructions themselves are broken down very well into good small chunks, so that anyone can approach them without it being too complicated.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>731 parts makes it a pretty substantial model to build. &nbsp;The only fairly rare pieces I think are the small &#39;statue&#39; pieces that were included, I don&#39;t believe there were any unique pieces here.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigures with this model.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not a fast builder, so the build probably took me about two and a half hours altogether. &nbsp;The majority of the pieces are small; there&#39;s a lot of 1x1s and 2x1s which can be quite fiddly to put together. &nbsp;There are still a few bigger pieces though, particularly around the base. &nbsp;It was a very enjoyable build however and I had fun putting it together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model looks as good as it can do for one this size (the size is decent)&nbsp;- I am very impressed with how good it looks and very pleased with the outcome. &nbsp;The general detail is very good, and I thought the horses were a nice touch.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very, very good. &nbsp;A great model at this price point, and I am really pleased with the outcome and whole process. &nbsp;The designer has done a great job in capturing the shape and detail of the fountain and it&#39;s one that I am really happy to put on display in the house.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t have a huge amount if &#39;playability&#39;, but I don&#39;t expect it to. &nbsp;This doesn&#39;t detract from the model at all for me.</p>

<p>Now I just need to get some Lego coins to throw into the fountain...</p>
