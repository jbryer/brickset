Sooo
Pros
You get all the scuba gear in one set.
You get some of those new curved bricks with a mechanical pattern.
You get Flex (The best of all the Alpha Team minifigs).
You get a rope with hook on the end (which is a good gadget for Flex)
The engines rotate.
You also get a 1x4 with studs on side brick.

The cons
There is no where for Flex to sit.
Those X*%!!@# FLAPS KEEP FALLING OFF.

Over all, good with a couple of exceptions.

It has some yellow bricks that I haven't now before that can be practical for alternative models.
I will rate it with a 4 out of 5.

 (4791) is a LEGO Alpha Team set which came out in 2001. It comes
with 1 minifig and 42 pieces. This set does include no decals and 
there's one mistake in the instructions and no missing pieces.</p><p><br></p><p><span><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/4791-1.jpg[/img]</span></span></span><br></p><p><br>
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><br>The box and the instructions are very nice.
 As I told you at the beginning: There's one mistake in the 
instructions on page 4 when you build the minifig. Agent Flex is getting a white arm instead of an orange arm. Recommended age of this model is 6-12. At the end of the instructions you're able to find a comic.<br><br><p><span><br></span></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><br><span>The parts are really nice and useful for brickfilms and MOC's. What surprised me is that the cable was already attached to the cable drum when I opened the bag. Normally we have to attach the cables to the cable drum ourself.<br><br></span><span></span><br><span><span><span></span></span></span><p><span><span><span></span><br></span></span></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><br><br><p><span><span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Flex:</span></span> Flex comes with a blue suit with an orange arm and printed legs. He has a dark gray air tank and a dark gray helmet with the blue goggles. On his face you can see red hair, a smiling face and a headset. He also comes with gray hands and black fins.<br>

back are the fins and the cable. The fins come off very easily if you 
want to sviwel them. On the top you can see a dark gray harpoon on each 
side and on the bottom on each side you can see a turbine.</span><p><br></p><p><span><span><span>[img]http://www.klokriecher.de/gallery_pics/l/4791-1.jpg[/img]</span></span></span></p><span></span><br><br><h4>Ideas:</h4><br>This
 set also comes with 2 ideas which you can build with the pieces of this
 set. There're no instructions for those models but you can build them 
from the pictures on my website.<br><br><b>Positive:</b><br><br>Minifig<br>Very sturdy<br>No stickers<br>Nice pieces for brickfilms and MOC's<br>Ideas which you can build with the pieces of this set<br><br><h4>Negative:</h4><br>Not so many play features<br><br><h4>Summary</h4><p><br>All
in all this set is okay and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-26T17:17:05.027Z","Mission Begun","<p>Set #4791 Alpha Team Sub-Surface Scooter: A small cheap set from the Mission Deep Sea series, this set offers up a small, fast and easy build with potential. Sadly some of that potential is lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is still good, but it isn't great by any means. The Sub-Surface Scooter is a small vessel piloted by Flex of Alpha Team, the Mini-Figure is great and the winch gimmick included with this set is pretty nifty, but it is lacking a few crucial elements to make it a truly great set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first of which is a place for Flex to actually sit to pilot the craft, secondly where are the controls? Turn it on and you can't steer it anywhere, you just get taken along for the ride, thirdly the winch is missing a crank so you have to wind it by hand each time you want to use it to pick up an enemy sub or Ogel Minion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These three problems aside for the price you're paying on this set it is acceptable that some of these things are missing, in fact aside from the crank for the winch I suspect you could easily modify with existing pieces a control seat and panel so that Flex can actually steer where he wants to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set also has a few nice touches, for one it is a uniform yellow and black Alpha Team color, it includes two harpoon guns to fire on enemy attackers, and Flex comes with diving equipment and his regular cap. (I've given him one of my spare Space Police visors for it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printing on the figure is also a nice touch with one of the better face designs from the Alpha Team, he has an open grinning(?) mouth, and his costume matches the others in the subdued tones of the Mission Deep Sea uniforms for Alpha Team. (Yeah I really dig the subdued colors.) And when I say subdued I don't mean faded, but more darker in tone to give the appearance of seeing them underwater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall though I'd have to say unless you're a Mission Deep Sea Completist you can easily skip this set. Although if you're really desperate for sub pieces or mini-subs to include in your Atlantis display then this breaks up the reds of Atlantis with some nice yellows.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
