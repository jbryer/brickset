<ul>
	<li>Continuing what I said above, the playability of the neck suffers from the use of stepped hinges &ndash; rather than the new joint plates or even clip/bar plates &ndash; for articulation.</li>
	<li>Arms and legs are uneccesarily short (if you can call those legs! More like feet).</li>
	<li>Arms are hinged.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still better than Seismo.</p>

<p>Lunk has some excellent parts which can be used to build the model and play with, or in many of your own creations!</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t great for its play values, and it was a bit expensive, but I enjoyed building this and making many of my own creations with it!</p>
