<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Gobba</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Gobba set comes from the Lego theme Mixels, released in 2014. The theme was retired in 2017. I have fond memories of this set because it was one of my favorites because I played with it a lot and made up stories around an imaginary character. In my stories, Gobba loved to eat and chew on things.&nbsp; When I was playing with this lego figure, Gobba was the crazy action figure.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Pros</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The only build of the set is the character Gobba. He has short, stubby arms, squat legs, and a&nbsp; huge mouth with lots of teeth. His color scheme consists of brown and burnt orange with white for the teeth. His hands are attached by ball joints meaning they have a 360&deg; rotation, and the finger can move up and down. It does not have many possibilities, but what it lacks in movement makes up for imaginative goofiness. Its proportions are off, so it looks pretty funny, most of his body consists of his giant mouth, and the rest of his limbs are laughably small.&nbsp; There was also a Mixels show that aired on Cartoon Network. Although I did not watch it, I was familiar with the characters in the show.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Cons</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The brown Lego pieces break very easily. The piece used for the torso of the set is a four-by-four brown circular piece. The part where you click the feet to the base is fragile and breaks easily. I went through four of them in less than six months. The piece count is low, 57 pieces, for $5. Usually, I say a set is of good value when the set is $20 and has 200 pieces. Other factors that go into pricing/value include licensing and Minifigures included in the set. The piece ratio is my place to decide whether or not a Lego set is something where I want to spend my money.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Overall thoughts&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">For such a small set, I found it very enjoyable.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">If you want to buy this set today, it will cost you&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">about $20. I repeat, you may also want to consider buying an extra cylinder piece in advance.</span></span></p>
