<p>Meh building experience, parts, and value. Ok playability from the opening and closing mouth. It&#39;s a meh building experience due to some parts being boring, such as the legs for example. The parts are also not very exciting as it&#39;s mostly common pieces. The value is also kind of lacking due to Jawg being very blocky.</p>
