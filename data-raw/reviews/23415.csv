<p>Building experience was meh as it felt like it was very exposed in certain areas. The&nbsp;parts are meh and not very unique. Playability is ok with the opening and closing mouth.&nbsp;The&nbsp;price are ok for the Mixel at 70 pieces. The legs are also not very possible without Kraw falling.</p>
