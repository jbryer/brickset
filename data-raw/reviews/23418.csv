<p>Box/Instructions: Normal everything was broken up nicely. &nbsp;Easy enough for young builders but not so simple as to insult AFOL&#39;s</p>

<p>Parts: Lot&#39;s of ice cubes, the ships hull is nice and sleek and fairly long. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:Pretty much the same as in 60036 with the addition of the ships Captain. &nbsp;Again it&#39;s nice to see a female mini fig included. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The little mini builds are fun and add a lot of ambience to the whole set. &nbsp;The sled was a little different from the one in 60036 as were the helicopter and snow mobile which ads nice variety to the line and increases interest if you&#39;re building both. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: The final product is really impressive. &nbsp;The way the accessory and mini build pieces fit on the ship with out looking tacked on is pretty slick. &nbsp;It feels realistic as a&nbsp;representation of an Arctic expedition. &nbsp; All the varied elements give it a high level of playability and really make this a great value in my opinion. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: I would recommend this to set to anyone. &nbsp;I really felt there was a lot of brick for the buck. My tween step child loved it as much as I did and spent a lot of time rebuilding and playing with it</p>
