<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This has one of those long thin boxes that sort of makes the set look bigger on the shelf than you&#39;d expect, especially for a set that&#39;s under 400 pieces. This is probably because of how many large parts there are. The box&nbsp;does do an excellent job of representing the set.</p>

<p>There are two instruction booklets,&nbsp;which I don&#39;t think was necessary. The second book picks up at an extremely odd place at the very end of bag 2 where you&#39;re assembling the wheels. I assume that they want&nbsp;to let a second person&nbsp;work on the wheels while the first person starts on the rest, but the second person would finish with the wheels significantly before the wheels were ready to be attached. All in all, though, everything is up to the usual Lego standards.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For those who hate stickers, this set only has two!&nbsp;A lot of the look of the vehicle comes in the form of fire and teeth, so it doesn&#39;t need too many stickers for detail.</p>

<p>Parts: You get&nbsp;four&nbsp;large wheel pieces&nbsp;that come in two varieties. Also of note are&nbsp;three tail pieces that are&nbsp;half green and&nbsp;half orange connected to&nbsp;a 2x1 plate. The orange half&nbsp;is extra flexible;&nbsp;it&#39;s&nbsp;made with a different sort of plastic than typical&nbsp;Legos. There are tons of angled green pieces and rare parts I&#39;ve only seen in Chima Croc sets.&nbsp;In general, this is a pretty decent set for weird bricks and parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three figures in this set from three different tribes: Cragger the Crocodile, Stealthor the Sabretooth, and Vornon the Vulture.&nbsp;If you&nbsp;own more than a few&nbsp;Chima sets, you probably have a ton of Craggers already, but this one is a fire version with a different weapon than usual. He might be worth owning if you only had Craggers from older sets. Stealthor and Vernon are considerably less common as they didn&#39;t appear in any sets until late 2014 and only in $40+ sets. I&#39;d say that if you&#39;re not a Chima completionist, but you want a variety of different&nbsp;minifigures, this is a decent set since you&nbsp;get both Stealthor and Vernon in one.</p>

<p>One miscellaneous odd thing I noticed is that the way they show you to have Stealthor holding his weapon makes no sense for play purposes. If he holds his claw on the underside as shown in the instructions, he can&#39;t lift it off the ground because of his armor. It makes much more sense to have him grasp the claw from the peg on the back.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As with almost every Chima vehicle, the set is framed with a lot of technic parts and you spend the most time working on the various moving attachments. You don&#39;t have to stop to apply stickers except for one step, which is a nice change of pace from the norm. It&#39;s amazing just how many technic racks you end up cramming into the back of this. You&#39;ll be scratching your head about what the designers had in mind until the very end. I had a pretty good time building this vehicle.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The first thing I noticed upon completion was that the space this thing takes up&nbsp;is almost as much as the entire 680 piece Croc Swamp Hideout set. When I first saw this in the store, I thought maybe I&#39;d be parking this inside the mouth of the entrance to my hideout. No chance of that!&nbsp;The giant wheels and the wingspan of the side guns gives&nbsp;this an absolutely enormous&nbsp;footprint.</p>

<p>When you finish building, the vehicle is going to be sitting&nbsp;with the guns down on the side, which leaves a glaring aesthetic flaw: the red technic racks on the back are in full view, with no pieces to cover them. This problem is significantly lessened by pressing down on the tail to put it in &quot;Fire Power Chi Mode&quot; as shown on the back of the box. This is my preferred default form, and there&#39;s no reason to ever not be in this mode, really. Other than the bare red racks, it looks really great. I can&#39;t think of any way the front of the vehicle could be improved. The designer did a fantastic job overall.</p>

<p>There is also a tiny catapult and frozen tree that the ice tribes are supposed to use to fight back. Honestly,&nbsp;it&#39;s&nbsp;funny to think about how quickly Stealthor and Vornon&nbsp;would be destroyed if they tried to fight the Fire Striker with that catapult.&nbsp;It would be better off attached to a larger base that comes with some other set, as would the figures.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a worthwhile addition to any Chima collection, and you might also consider it if you just like technic vehicles with a lot of moving parts. There aren&#39;t too many&nbsp;vehicles that would fare well in a head-on collision with Cragger&#39;s Fire Striker. It&#39;s&nbsp;one of the most intimidating vehicles released.</p>
