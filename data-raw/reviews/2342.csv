My only complaints is the cockpit, which doesn't open. Cam is ok (but why doesn't she have those glasses anymore?).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-09T12:37:09Z","Not bad","I don't like AT2 much but this is a nice set. The fig is great with her special dark red hair. I bought it because it was on sale.

"danim","2008-01-07T19:28:51.233Z","Good Set","I bought this set a couple of years ago and built it in about 3 minutes. I think the articulated arms are brillant as is the TeeVee ROV.

The only cons are why is the diving equitment outside the sub and why is the cockpit glass not hinged otherwise a great set",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-02T11:29:01.037Z","Alpha Team Rocks!","I have this set and it rocks! Alpha Team was one of the best lego themes ever! I loved the small robot vehical! I like how it can reattach to the sub. I like the Cam minifigure and the Sub! Good set to get! It's an easy build and fun to play with!

"smiley905","2007-12-28T17:11:00.81Z","pretty good","the sub is allright, the arms are not neaded and the gun in the right arms looks silly. the proppelers are cool the tail fin is nice and the bumpers on the side are good peices, the cocpit doesnt open, so its hard to get the mf in and out. for the sub 3\5

the little robot rocks its well made and the yellow role bar thing that goes around it is a good idea, 5 out of 5

overall this set is a good buy well done",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Lego_Guru","2008-11-14T22:27:03.327Z","Awesome Set!","This was my first Alpha Team set and now it's one of my favorites. My favorite part of this set is the Teevee minisub. I also like the positionable arms and propellers. The minifigure includes diving gear( flippers, oxygen tank, and helmet). It's color scheme is cool to. The only thing that's bad about this set is the fact that it doesn't come with any bad guys. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

We get a handle where you can store the air tank and the black fins and on the back is the rear wing which is a very nice piece to have. On each side you can see a turbine with a propellor which sviwel full 360Â°. The sub also has a part where you can store the small sub which is a very neat looking sub. It comes with a very rare part which is printed. One of the markings on this element says 'TEE V'. On each side of the minisub is a headlight and on the top is a binoculars. <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span>The cockpit of the bigger sub can be opened very easily but there's not much going on in the inside. You only get two joysticks but no dashboard. Also a negative part about the cockpit is that the cockpit isn't very closed which means that the driver who is going to control the sub will die. Underneath you can see a little engine too and on each side is a headlight which fall off very easily. Also on each side you can see an arm which does sviwel. One arm is holding a camera. Even if this model doesn't have so many play features I would recommend you to get it because you get a rare element and a rare minifig in this set.<br><br></span><span></span><br><br></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ideas:</span><br><br>This

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-26T13:03:42.72Z","DIVE, DIVE. Stop the Evil Ogel with Alpha Team.","<p>Set #4792 Alpha Team&nbsp;Navigator &amp; ROV: The Alpha Team Mission Deep Sea sets were all very interesting and impressive looking sets. The uniform coloring of the Alpha Team submarines were also very appealing for display purposes and such and on top of that they could even fit in with the old Aquazone. (If you had any.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has a large selection of pieces to use in construction of a small submersible craft and Robotic Vehicle... I'm not sure if that's what ROV stands for, but it's good enough for me. The submarine is what we'll start this review off with. It is a sturdy little craft built to venture into the darkest depths of the sea. (As evidenced by the little lights on either side.) It also has twin mechanical arms for picking up hidden treasures or clues to Ogel's sinister plot or even to defend itself with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mini ROV is sort of like an extra Mini-Figure, it represents a named character (Tee-Vee) in his Mission Deep Sea form. It can travel into small crevices and caves, places the larger sub can't go. Being a relatively inexpensive set it still includes diving equipment for the driver of the vehicle in case of emergency evacuation needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is an interesting addition to any LEGO display. Her name is Cam if I'm not mistaken and she has a uniquely colored straight red hairpiece, it's a darker shade than the original Alpha Team Cam's hairpiece, making it more subdued. This entire theme had a more subdued tone to it color wise as opposed to the original Alpha Team sets of the previous year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Mini-Figure also comes with a unique printing for her face and torso, it isn't double-sided like some of the newer figures, but it still looks very unique and not uniform. Like the tons of Police Officers, Firefighters, Construction Workers and Citizens of LEGO City that march through my collection. She stands out. Aside from the flippers,&nbsp;helmet and breathing tank she comes with no other accessories though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all I'd have to say, if you like the feel of unique mini-figures in your collection then getting one of the Alpha Team sets isn't the worst choice to make. This set also makes a nice addition to any Atlantis display and breaks up the monotony of the all red submarines with a mostly yellow one. And for those who can't stand them, as a bonus this set does not include stickers, it's all printed bricks.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
