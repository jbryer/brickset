"one_wag","2014-06-02T09:20:01.997Z","Ah C'mon it's got Rocket Raccoon in it - what more do you need?","<p>Pleasantly surprised to see this on the shelves of my local toy shop...didn&#39;t hesitate in purchasing as this was one of the sets of the year for me.</p>

<p>First the con&#39;s - price - &pound;44.99 is &pound;10.00 too much - for the part numbers and the set itself once you have built it it doesn&#39;t look much.&nbsp; Also without seeing the film I cannot comment on how accurate it represents anything from the motion picture.&nbsp; But then Iron Man 3&#39;s sets were very tenuous.</p>

<p>Also how lazy do Lego think kids are these days that they cannot even &quot;flick&quot; fire the missiles - it comes with one of the new firing mechanisms.</p>

<p>Grumble over - on to the Pro&#39;s</p>

<p>Minifigs - Like the the title of this review - it&#39;s got Rocket Raccoon in it - splendid representation of the movie uniform - tail is far better than the Chima minifig tails - it attaches to the waist instead of the neck and is in soft plastic.&nbsp; Head is molded with shoulder guards and he comes, quite naturally, with an infeasibley large gun!</p>

<p>Next is Groot - on the box I was put off by the molded head/torso look - but that actual build is far better than the pictures portray - and far more articulate than Groot himself.</p>

<p>Karen Gillan&#39;s character is blue and wields standard ninja swords - nice to see purple legs and I really don&#39;t know who the other fella is with the hood - but he does come with a new gun design (well new to me) that has two stud attachments and two hand grip areas (one on the grip and one like a shot gun).</p>

<p>You get a round space ship built with lots of azure and bright blue bricks and the gantry has some nice dark red tiles and classic space fans will love the trans clear yellow pieces (you get an awful lot).</p>

<p>I admit that this review is a tad rambling - but the overall feel is that the set itself is great - just overpriced - but ultimately it has Rocket Raccoon in it....</p>

"sentinal07","2014-07-29T22:35:38.707Z","I am Groot!","<p>&nbsp;I have to start by saying, if you are a lego Marvel Super Heros fan, you need to get this set. I bought this set along with the starblaster, and I love them both. When I saw the photos for the Guardians of the Galaxy sets, this one was my favorite. Now some people may think, this one?!&nbsp; Why not the milano? I have 2 things to relpy to that: Rocket Racoon and Groot. These two figures are amazing, and make this set 100% worth it. Now on to the set break down.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a medium sized box, typical for a 40-50 dollar set. This set came with 2 small instruction manuals and a &#39;comic book&quot; as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with 433 pieces and costs 40 dollars, so the price per piece is just under 10 cents per piece. This is very good, especially for a lisenced set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As I stated in the overveiw, the minifigs will really drive this set. Rocket Racoon and Groot are great!! A sacaaren soldier comes in ever GOTG set, so he is not rare, but still a nice fig. Nebula looks cool, but since The movie has not come out yet, I am not sure of her role in the film.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The little mining pod is cool, but it seems a little out of place for this set. It obviously will play a part in the film, so maybe after I see the film, it will make a bit more sense to me. The mining base is cool, and has some good play features. It has a small catapult, a trapdoor, and a tower knock down/explode feature which are all very fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall, all of this stuff combined makes a very nice looking set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all, I love this set and would recommend it to anyone who is a GOTG fan</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-10-27T14:10:25.17Z","Groot and Rocket take on Nebula","<p><strong>Set #76020 Knowhere Escape Mission: </strong>The second largest set in the sub-theme and the only way to get Groot and Nebula this set is a mixed bag of good and bad and this review will attempt to explain it all to you.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: This one is the same design from past LEGO Marvel sets, so there isn&rsquo;t much to go over. That being said I find myself really enjoying the photo work done with the set. The front of the box has a thrilling action scene that showcases the set quite aptly and back explains all of the features with some fun action shots.</p>

<p>Instructions: There are two numbered manuals in this set, the first handles the build through bag one and half of bag two, the second builds the rest of bag two and finishes off with bag three. The manuals are standard for LEGO Marvel and they include very few cross-promotional images. I feel as though manual two has far more pages than manual one, so I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why LEGO decided to break it up between books. Perhaps for cost measures.</p>

<p>Comic: this is the exact same comic that was included in Starblaster Showdown. Nothing to add concerning it here, aside from the desire to see them add another page to show off all of the Minifigures from this year in the Marvel Super Heroes posters we saw for 2012 and 2013.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>A large number of pieces in this set come in different shades of grey, there are however a decent number of dark maroon pieces and some teal and light blue pieces. Because of the use of stickers these pieces can be used for anything if you avoid putting stickers on your sets. Handy for some parts, but not ideally priced for a parts pack.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Groot: As a buildable character he isn&rsquo;t considered a Minifigure, however we&rsquo;ll discuss him here. He&rsquo;s a bit of a mixed bag honestly, the choice of making him buildable has left some deeply disappointed. I don&rsquo;t see the problem honestly, aside from curious proportions the character captures the likeness quite well, and the use of balljoints was a nice touch. The biggest problem is the hinge plate elbows, I would have preferred balljoints here as well since their connection wouldn&rsquo;t be easy to fall off.</p>

<p>His waist is a huge issue though, he stands taller than even big figs like Hulk, but his waist just seems to be in the wrong place, as if he should be slightly taller. The sculpted piece might have needed a bit of a different design. No accessories unique to him.</p>

<p>Rocket Raccoon: This version of Rocket is in the outfit he wore at the beginning of the film. He has a double-sided torso print and that&rsquo;s about it. No leg printing, his unique head and tail pieces are the same found in the regular polybag. The big difference is his weapon, he includes a massive blaster built out of several pieces. It&rsquo;s a great build for an accessory, however it does tend to make Rocket top heavy. He also includes the silver orb.</p>

<p>Nebula: Karen Gillian gets a Minifigure before Matt Smith. That&rsquo;s right the Doctor&rsquo;s Companion Amy Pond cosplays as Nebula&hellip; Well maybe not, but this Minifigure represents the actress as seen in this film, and it does a great job of capturing her appearance on screen. She has a double-sided torso and a single-sided facial print with back printing, her accessories are two black katana, she&rsquo;s also got two different arm colours. Her right is blue and her left is silver.</p>

<p>The Sakaaran: Identical to the one found in Starblaster Showdown, this is the generic faceless grunt of the enemy forces. It isn&rsquo;t Kree or Skrull, but it will suffice I suppose. Not much to say honestly, what I said previously pretty much covers him.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Bag 1: Here you build the Groot character, which is a straightforward build, I enjoy some of the interesting selection of pieces used to make him, and he does feature a few of the nice small balljoint pieces. The rest of the build consists of a piece of set dressing, part of the large industrial looking device that is the main bulk of the model. This build isn&rsquo;t too troublesome, nor does it include any irritating or tricky parts.</p>

<p>Bag 2: Here you build another section of the industrial looking set piece, a much smaller section. This entire thing is modular, meaning you can attach it together in alternate configurations with a bit of minor alterations to the build, the instructions do not tell you how, however clever builders are sure to figure it out without much trouble.</p>

<p>You also build Rocket&rsquo;s little ball ship thing, the same one he used during the Knowhere escape scenes in the film. This is a very impressive little build that isn&rsquo;t too complex and features some nice splash of colour. We&rsquo;ll discuss the play features in the completed model, suffice it to say the ship is not without a few flaws.</p>

<p>Bag 3: Completing the large industrial set piece with the last few sections of the build and adding a small missile emplacement for the Sakaaran to use in the escape mission. This section of the build has a few irritating moments as you&rsquo;re working on the scaffolding, but once it&rsquo;s all together it is relatively solid.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Industrial Scaffolding and Set Piece: This large model is impressive, and features three play features. A small catapult with yellow tubes for projectiles, a falling trap door on top with the use of a technic pull-back trigger and a knock the entire scaffolding over gimmick. The gimmicks work quite well, and the design of the model is fairly impressive, it uses technic pins for a modular design allowing you to combine the numerous separate elements in any configuration you can think of. This model also has the benefit of not using any stickers.</p>

<p>Rocket&rsquo;s Space Ship: This round little vehicle isn&rsquo;t designed for deep space exploration, it&rsquo;s a construction vehicle of some sort. It&rsquo;s also loaded with charm, the cockpit is a bit of a problem though, the bubble doesn&rsquo;t fold in flush against the sides, so it looks a bit odd. The grabbing claws are not impressive, they can rotated, but they can&rsquo;t bend for useful manipulation of things, like Minifigures, so grabbing anything is limited. The rear section has an opening section that drops energy balls on the enemy. This is a great gimmick that works well.</p>

<p>Sakaaran Missile Launcher: This model is a nice addition to the set, it incorporates the missile launching piece to great effect and works well as an enemy emplacement to launch. It moves up and down on a hinged piece, other than that there isn&rsquo;t much to it.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Definitely a good set to get, especially if you&rsquo;re looking to get all of the Guardians. This set features two members of the team, a pair of enemies to fight and a nice collection of models that do a decent job of replicating a scene from the movie. Despite the controversial nature of Groot and the large outcry as to how he&rsquo;s constructed in certain circles of the internet, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a worthy set to pick up and one of the must have Marvel sets of last year. Recommended.</p>
