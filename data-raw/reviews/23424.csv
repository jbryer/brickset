"merman","2014-02-15T13:37:59.063Z","Amazing Licensed Set Worth the Bucks","<p>I had some doubts at first when I first saw this set. Wasn&#39;t the look of it too plain? Was it wirth the rather steep price? When I first had the huge box in my hands I was more convinced. When I started building and met the final result I was overwhelmed at how wonderful this set is.<br />
<br />
<strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
This is quite a sturdy big box filled with wonderful parts. The instructions were presented in three booklets, of which the dark brown was a big hard to distinguish at times. You start building some accessories and the beautiful pink Simpsons car. Then you begin with the garage, followed by the house itself. You end up with the removable section that contains Bart&#39;s bedroom and half of&nbsp;Lisa&#39;s bedroom<br />
<br />
<strong>Parts</strong><br />
A very important reasons why this set is so expensive, besides the license, is the fact it contains some unique elements in exceptional cartoonish colors. It has over 400 different parts, some only come in one each. Lego tends to become more expensive when it has a high amount of different parts. Also the set that contains more than 2,500 parts doesn&#39;t have an enormous amount of small parts that makes the part count rise skyhigh. It has nice amounts of purple, pink, dark pink, blues and greens. Usually I hate stickers and don&#39;t even apply them, but for this set the stickers really add something to the final result.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
For figs probably produced in China, this set is of extremely impressive quality. Some complaints have been made about the tired look on most figs, but that doesn&#39;t bother me that much. Some figs have bi-colored moulded arms and legs (they are not painted) and the heads are made of hard plastics. The figs look absolutely amazing!<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong><br />
The build is rather straighforward, but rewarding anyway. It is a nice touch you also build a lot of furniture besides building walls. Highlights of the mini builds are the TV and the barbecue. Very nice and clever designs!<br />
<br />
<strong>The completed model</strong><br />
Although not completely accurate to the &#39;real&#39; thing (it doesn&#39;t have Bart&#39;s room above the garage), the final house is rather impressive. The roof parts fit really well. Also the house is full of color and completely tiled on the floors (except the garage). The furniture is only attached to some studs, so can easily be removed. The final look is not just all tan, also because the mini builds. As I said before, the figs are absolutely stunning!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
Just get this set if you can afford it! You will not regret it. It looks amazing next to the Modulars and the Haunted House! This was my most expensive set ever and one of my few licensed onces, but it was worth every penny!</p>

"aldredd","2015-02-04T10:22:55.737Z","Fun to build, but not a Modular standard","<p>Although I&#39;d been keen to get my hands on this set, I probably wouldn&#39;t have bought this set for myself, but my wife bought it for my for Christmas - which is why I love her so much!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box&nbsp;Big, bright &amp; yellow - as you&#39;d expect. It&#39;s pretty full, but the box did seem a lot bigger that it really needed to be, given the drive towards reducing packaging.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly, a lot of tan and brown bricks and plates can be found. But there is&nbsp;a lot of colour in there too, with a good mix of tiles for all the flooring and colourful&nbsp;(read: garish) bricks and plates for the car and furnishings.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get the full family of Marge, Homer, Bart, Maggie and Lisa. Plus Ned - I&#39;d have preferred to see Snowball or Santa&#39;s Little Helper, but does allow for some fun scenes using&nbsp;Ned.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I somewhat naively&nbsp;assumed I&#39;d be building something similar to a &#39;Modular&#39; in terms of build style. it&#39;s a large building with 2500 pieces, which explains why - &nbsp;but,&nbsp;to be fair, the clue is on the box - this is listed as being suitable for ages 12+, whereas modulars are typically listed as 16+.</p>

<p>What you don&#39;t get is the detail that goes into the modulars. But, I hear you ask, what detail? Valid question - we&#39;re building a cartoon house in blocky, bold, colours. It makes for a pretty quick, easy going build for its size - but enjoyable nonetheless. You&#39;ll probably have no problem building this whilst watching The Lego Movie and singing along to Everything Is Awesome.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What you&#39;re left with is a fairly large build, with a detachable garage and lots of furniture / accessories. What this set lacks in build-engagement, it&nbsp;more than makes up in playability. Now, I don&#39;t really play with my sets. Heck, I don&#39;t really get much chance to display them - but I had some great fun setting up some scenes and playing the part of the characters. My daughter soon got involved, and we had a lot of fun playing with the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I felt a little deflated at the end of the build - for the size / piece count and price, I expected something a little more - I just wasn&#39;t sure <em>of&nbsp;what</em>. But once I stopped building and started playing with it, I found what that &#39;little more&#39; was - fun factor. This set oozes fun - and am now looking forward to the Kwik-e-Mart - it will most certainly be on my Buy List.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ps. You&#39;re still singing&nbsp;Everything Is Awesome, aren&#39;t you?</p>

"poroto","2014-06-11T14:22:13.84Z","very nice, but...","<p>Was really looking forward to this set till i saw it at the shops and found the inside of the house very plain and blocky (eeerrr you know what i mean, i hope) but since i already ordered through amazon, because its $100 cheaper than in Australia i waited with a little less enthusiasm.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is nice and big, shiny and colorful&nbsp;and screamed Simpsons, it also fits perfectly with the yellow of Lego brand. Instructions are the usual for these sets, 3 thick instruction booklets bagged with cardboard to keep em in perfect condition. Also small sticker sheet with the rug, skateboard, ramp and picture frame &#39;photos&#39;, my favorite&nbsp;sticker is the tiny &#39;property of Ned Flanders&#39; one, of which there are 3.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots and lots of parts, from Friends pink/purple to a light/dark blue which i though was nice to have without it being attached to &#39;Friends&#39; category&nbsp;:), otherwise its your standard colors with lots of flat tile pieces which make the house look nice and sleek. Also there are lots of BBQ utensils but colors are a bland yellow which are not the best choice and look cheap, straight to the spare parts for me and not a fan of them...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get the whole family, excluding Santas&nbsp;Little Helper and Snowball, but instead you get Flanders. At first i didn&#39;t mind however the more i thought about it the more it occurred that Simpsons Figurine collection already has Flanders so it would&#39;ve&nbsp;been nice to include the pets instead and a mini dog house instead of a BBQ we got in the creator house already.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Having built lots of these houses and structures i thought it was a straight&nbsp;forward build with nice touches like the stairs not being one piece and blocks stacked instead, the small bricks in between make it look much more detailed than your standard staircase. The most challenging part i thought was Homer&#39;s car, all those little pink pieces are hard to see and took me too long to finish the car having to look at instructions 100 times, but that&nbsp;is probably me and not the build itself, but i do have to say it was the most time consuming piece.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&#39;The completed model is big, chunky and a great interpretation of the Simpsons house from the cartoon, however, the inside is very cramped and the dinning table would be impossible to sit all characters and fit inside.&nbsp;Bart&#39;s&nbsp;room is also at the back and awkward&nbsp;to access, even Marge is challenging to stand as her hair piece doesn&#39;t fit unless the figure is placed on an angle and then straightened, hair piece is also heavy and needs balancing with the legs, but to add to all this is the fact that inside is flat tiled so slippery and tricky to stand upright (Marge only).</p>

<p>The lounge is nice and big with the tv and couch a standout, but again, even though it has a large open space, it still feels cramped as the roof is now low and have to get right in there to place mini figure, top is modular obviously cause otherwise unplayable with the top on. For display i had to remove roof and top floor to place minifig and then reassemble it cause even if i did reach with my hand, i couldnt&nbsp;see really.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In conclusion, you get 6 of characters, a great looking model which will be instantly recognizable and look great on display. But only on display, its hard to play with as it is so cramped. The car is nice as an iconic piece but i couldn&#39;t close the door unless Homer&#39;s hand was almost above his shoulders. Looks great but it could&#39;ve helped with maybe a few extra blocks in height for the first floor and making the removable like usual creator buildings and not just the roof.</p>

<p>I still like the look and wouldn&#39;t fault it other than for spacing, specially as its the first Lego build my kids got over in an hour or two and i interpreted it as a lack of playability from the model itself.</p>

<p>3/5 stars for me, nice and iconic but i was also not overly impressed with size. BTW is not small just in my opinion it could have been a tad bigger. Monster House is big but didnt feel cramped and was alot&nbsp;more detailed and easily accessible. However its the Simpsons house in Lego so you cant really go wrong! :)</p>

"mcleod4568","2015-05-11T07:09:33.59Z","A Great model but such a frustrating build!","

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is huge - about the same size as the Pet Shop or maybe the Parisian Restaurant but I have not really measured it accurately.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are over 2500 parts to this set &nbsp;and so it will look huge when you have finished building it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I must also add something that is annoying to me. Included are several cutlery parts as well as pots and pans for Ned Flanders to use I imagine but there is nowhere provided within the finished model to store them - no cupboard or any other storage space which is annoying.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigures look awesome. I love the heads of them as they look exquisitely sculpted and molded.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is where I must report my biggest annoyance. The method used to attach the garage section to the main part of the house utilises&nbsp;4&nbsp;4205105: Brick 1X2 W. Horizontal Snap bricks and 4&nbsp;4205107: Technic Brick 1X2, &Oslash;4.9 bricks. This was a massively frustrating annoyance for me when trying to attach the garage after finishing the main house. The way the walls of the garage are constructed near the door hole at the back meant that every time I tried to push the two parts together to click into place, the wall of the garage got destroyed in the process and I had to rebuild it. The walls of the garage just were not sturdy enough and kept breaking apart. So I had to employ some creative thinking and disassemble part of the wall of the house, attach the technic snap brick to the garage first then try an slot it in. This succeeded but only after 3 or 4 tries and must shouting of frustration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Otherwise the build was fairly standard, but I did enjoy seeing how the different beds were made.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks awesome. Enough said.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Would have been much more enjoyable without the hassle of attaching the garage but still I love this model and I would recommend it to any Lego or Simpsons fan. Regarding accuracy to the house on the show - I don;t care. It is still an awesome model.</p>

"wafflesdunne125","2016-03-13T21:40:53.943Z","AMAZING!!!!!","<p>I love the Simpsons. It&#39;s one of my favorite TV shows.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box itself is huge. HUGEAH. It came with 3 instruction manuals each very big, but it would be nice if we got one huge instruction manual.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice. Many exclusive parts such as Bart&#39;s Radioactive Man #1 and Lisa&#39;s paper. A few stickers from El Barto, to Property of Ned Flanders to the TV screen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>EVERY FIGURE IS EXCLUSIVE EXCEPT MAGGIE. AWESOME. We just need Grampa Simpson (available in Simpsons series 1), Santa&#39;s Little Helper, and Snowball II (both pets available in series 2), and maybe Ned&#39;s sons (Rod and Todd) but other than that great figures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build looks just like the simpsons house. Lisa&#39;s room should have a picture of &quot;The Happy Little Elves&quot; and a picture of &quot;Bleeding Gums&quot; Murphy.</p>

<p>Every other room is just about perfect.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>AMAZING</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a very great set, not just for Simpsons fans, but for people in&nbsp;general.</p>

<p>You can use this to make a lego town.</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2018-11-24T19:37:03.937Z","An American Classic Brought to Life by LEGO","<p>I never watched The Simpsons religiously to the point where I&#39;ve seen every single last episode in its 30 year run, but I did grow up with the show during its golden age, and seen enough to laugh at all the jokes and enjoy the stories. That being said, I was pretty excited when they started&nbsp;releasing Simpsons minifigures, and eventually major sets such as this and Kwik-E-Mart. I was gifted this for Christmas 4 years ago but didn&#39;t build it until the next Christmas as I was on vacation that year.</p>

<p>The build took 12 hours over two days, but despite having over 2500 pieces it wasn&#39;t particularly challenging compared to modulars&nbsp;which have similar piece counts but very intricate details. In contrast, the house is very simplistic in design and almost all of it is solid, continuous tan wall. It goes without saying that much of the build went towards stacking tan bricks on top of one another. Some of the smaller builds for the furniture had some pretty interesting building techniques though.</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp;include Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and Flanders. Homer has on his tie and security tag which is a call out to his job at the nuclear plant. Marge has on an apron, while Flanders is wearing a BBQ apron saying &quot;Hail to the Chef&quot;. Maggie&#39;s body piece is entirely solid. For some reason, Homer, Marge, and Bart have sleepy eyes but I don&#39;t really mind this. Bart comes with a skateboard while Lisa is holding a quiz where she got A+. The minifigures&nbsp;are excellent and very good quality. There was no doubt the heads had to be moulded separately as you simply wouldn&#39;t be able to capture all the details with conventional minifigure heads.</p>

<p>The house comes with a lot of loose details meant to be placed on their front yard. This includes Flanders&#39; BBQ grill with sausages, 2 lawn chairs with&nbsp;martini glasses, wheelbarrow, flower pots, mailbox, and skateboard ramp with &quot;El Barto&quot; spray painted on. The family car is included and can seat up to 4 of the family members. Cheese slopes on the front driver side are used to represent the permanent fender bender which never gets repaired. The roof is open top to accommodate Marge&#39;s hair (which in show makes her 3 feet taller), but we know that in show her hair gets bent in a 90 degree angle by the car roof whenever she&#39;s inside. A green radioactive rod is included, stored in the trunk, and is an obvious reference to the opening sequence when it gets stuck to Homer as he&#39;s leaving work.</p>

<p>The front entrance is surrounded by a brown archway to give the illusion that the door has a rounded top. A couple steps lead up to it with some greenery on both sides. Along the sides of the house are small brick-built bushes. The back door at the rear of the house goes out to a small section of concrete pavement. On the roof is an old fashioned antenna, and on the side wall above the garage is an air conditioning unit.</p>

<p>The garage isn&#39;t built integrally with the rest of the house but is instead attached to it with pins. In the garage are a work bench with toolbox, and tool rack/shelf with canisters and various tools. The garage door is built using plates and swings out to open as opposed to being roll-up like it should be in show. An arched entranceway (no door) on the side leads to the main house.</p>

<p>The main floor consists of the living room and kitchen. The living room includes the iconic couch, which can seat 3 comfortably, the antenna TV showing Itchy &amp; Scratchy, sailboat picture, and a piano. A small table with phone is&nbsp;located right beside the couch. The kitchen includes various drawers, cupboards, stovetop with oven, sink, pot, pans, cups, mixer, and several plates with utensils, apparently with cupcakes being served. There are 4 chairs and a round table which all sit loosely on the floor. There is a door which leads out to the rear of the house.</p>

<p>The second floor includes Bart&#39;s room, Lisa&#39;s room, Homer and Marge&#39;s room, and a bathroom. Bart&#39;s room has a Krusty the Clown poster on the wall, and a desk with a Radioactive Man comic. Above his desk is a pinboard. There&#39;s a shelf which has various items including a hat, radio, couple of boxes, and some sort of toy. A bed and night stand are also present. Lisa&#39;s room has a &quot;Jazz Fest&quot; poster, another bed with night stands on both sides, shelf with items such as books and magnifying glass, camera, hair brush, and table with vanity mirror. Homer and Marge&#39;s room only have their bed as well as Maggie&#39;s crib, with a lone basket sitting on the night stand. The bathroom has a shower, toilet with toilet roll, and sink. All the second floor rooms lead out to the staircase landing. The roof clearance is low at the edges due to the sloped roof and Marge will have a tough time trying to fit her hair under these places, but for the most part it&#39;s not much of a problem.</p>

<p>Accessibility&nbsp;is very well done as the house hinges at the chimney to allow full interior access. As well, the roof is split into 5 pieces and sits loosely on the house which can be lifted off to access the second floor. The section of the second floor containing the staircase landing, all of Bart&#39;s room, and 2/5 of Lisa&#39;s room can be lifted off&nbsp;to allow access to the living room below. Having the kitchen table and chairs remain in place is a little difficult since the kitchen is split right down the middle. The same problem exists for Lisa&#39;s room and opening up the house can cause the loose objects (camera and hair brush) to fall through.</p>

<p>The overall appearance of the house is fairly accurate and I appreciate the techniques used for the second floor windows and main floor bay windows. The interior is very brightly coloured&nbsp;and&nbsp;remain truthful to how they appear in the show. There are a lot of ordinary parts which come in rare colours which I&#39;m sure is much appreciated by MOCers.&nbsp;One look at the set and to me, it&#39;s pretty obvious which show the house is from. However, for the sake of practicality, it wasn&#39;t possible for the designers to capture every detail to the tee. Many of the rooms and compartments were eliminated, and existing rooms were re-oriented and relocated. There are so many differences that I won&#39;t list them here in my already monstrous review.&nbsp;One obvious example from the box art is how there is supposed to be a room above the garage. For comparison, <a href=""https://cs.pikabu.ru/post_img/big/2013/03/14/8/1363260144_1922695251.jpg"">this</a>&nbsp;is the original house layout, and you can see just how different it is from the LEGO set. For a playset though, it would be unreasonable to expect a perfect representation. Safe to say for most people, just a few simple details is enough to trigger memories from the show and make those connections to what&#39;s being represented by the LEGO set.</p>

<p>Overall this is a remarkable set, and, regardless of whether you watch the show or not, it serves as a wonderful play house. I think the price was around $250 CAD which is really good not only for all that you get, but the unlimited possibilities you have to build your own houses. The Kwik-E-Mart&nbsp;was once on my wish list but I guess I had other plans. Oh well, easy come, easy go.</p>

"Set_71006_the_Goat","2020-10-12T11:12:12.98Z","Perfect play-set","<p>The Simpson house (set number 71006) was the first&nbsp;Simpson set along the Lego Simpson&nbsp;cmf series (set number 71005) in 2014. I have to say this set is amazing and enormous: it weights 3.62k, it is 23 cm high and 42 cm wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the actual set tho. The house is not completely accurate (there should be a section on the second floor that just isn&#39;t there), but it has an incredible amount of details. On the first floor we have the iconic brown couch, where you can easy fit 3 figures. In the same room we have the blue telephone seen during <em>The mysterious voyage of homer&nbsp;</em>(season 8, episode 9), the purple piano, the staircase leading to the second floor&nbsp;and, of course, the tv with an itchy and scratchy sticker on it.&nbsp;We also have a reproduction of the kitchen. You can enter this room by simply opening the house, that is hinged in the middle to ease the access. Inside the kitchen we can find a table, 4 orange chairs and a complete set of pots, plates, forks and knifes.Talking about the second floor, ourselves humans can get our hands in there by simply removing the roof. We can find Homer&#39;s and Marge&#39;s bed, Maggie&#39;s crib, Lisa&#39;s room, the only bathroom in the house and Bart&#39;s room. Bart&#39;s room is put on tiles, so you can easily remove when you want to, but the brick will hold it thigh we you don&#39;t want to move it. The rooms are well detailed and they&#39;re great! Every section of the floor in the house is covered with tiles (light blue for the living room, yellow and light blue for the kitchen, purple for the bathroom and dark green for all the other rooms on the second floor). Next to the house we can find a detachable garage with a work table, vacuum cleaner and a set of tools that can be attached to the&nbsp;tool rack. The set also comes with the iconic car driven&nbsp;by homer and i gotta say it&#39;s perfect, even tho you can&#39;t fit the whole family. The sets also gives us a ton of small side builds, including a grill with 2 sausages, 2 fruit cocktails, a ramp for Bart&#39;s skateboard, 2 garden loungers and two flower pots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figs are very similar to the one we got in the cmf, tho they have different printings for the head and the body.</p>

<p>This set costed &euro;199.99, $199.99 and &pound;188.99 and it included 2523 pieces. Even without considering price per pieces, the value you get here is amazing.</p>

<p>Personally I love this set, the build is so nice and detailed and the figs are really good. I recommend this for sure!&nbsp;</p>
