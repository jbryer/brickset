"AyCarrumba","2015-11-15T13:23:24.41Z","My first Fire Station Playset","<p>This was a gift from a family member for my Sons 4th Birthday. I also chose to buy this for my Nephew&#39;s 3rd birthday a few months ago, so I&#39;ve now built and played with this set twice!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is vibrant and fun with a good depiction of the built set and its components. The Instructions are great with simple step by step pictorial guides that enable children to build with minimum guidance.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with other Junior sets, there are large parts that make up the &#39;bulk&#39; of the set. The vehicle chassis has proved popular with my son, enabling him to create vehicles with ease - I suspect it might begin to annoy in a year or two when his skills improve but for now it&#39;s perfect. The Slide is really nice, such a fun alternative to a firemans pole. Of course there&#39;s a Bin fire to put out, and printed screens on the Control room computer.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two neat little Fire Guys, one with a beard and one with glasses. Did Lego miss a trick not making one a Female Fire Fighter?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple and Fun! The control room comes together nicely and I love the arch over the ramps.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Such a fun play set with great scenarios to play out. The Fire station is well set up for an emergency, with a bed, the emergency slide, and the fire engine of course.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very happy with this set, especially at its slightly discounted price point. It&#39;ll build in well to larger fire stations in future. My Son enjoys it hugely and I know my Nephew has as well. Recommended.</p>
