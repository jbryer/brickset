He has a bucket full of Duplo, but after seeing him playing with proper Lego blocks at Legoland&nbsp;Windsor I&#39;ve realised he&#39;s more than ready for the real thing. I was planning on buying just a box full of bricks, but he chose this set and I&#39;m very glad he did.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a very handy plastic tub, which has an obvious use as a storage box for a growing collection and is a well thought out move on Lego&#39;s part to supply this with what is likely to be a first set.</p>

<p>Whilst he&#39;s too young to follow the instructions alone, I could easily see him being able to in a year or so, and we had great fun building it all together. He enjoyed putting together a lot of the minifigs and putting the wheels on the catapult.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is our first proper Lego set (I&#39;m returning to Lego after 30 years)&nbsp;but I&#39;m very impressed with the selection of parts. The doors and windows of the dungeon are especially nicely done.</p>

<p>However, what makes me especially pleased with this set is that you get three full bags of extra pieces that aren&#39;t needed for the main build. With these you can build all kinds of things - we&#39;ve only done farmyard animals so far - making it great value for getting started.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are I think all pretty standard from the Castles theme, but it&#39;s been interesting to see how my son has taken to them. He loves the skeleton and the bad knight (who reminds him of the bad red pirate at the Legoland Windsor pirates show).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As you&#39;d expect the build wasn&#39;t difficult for an adult and took less than an hour. I don&#39;t have a &quot;non Juniors&quot; build to compare it to and can&#39;t comment on how feasible it is for a child, but everything was very clearly and logically labelled and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a supposedly simple set I&#39;m really impressed by the attention to detail. Lovely little features like the table with the wine cup and leg of chicken, the shield above the gate and&nbsp;the ladder to the tower have really impressed me. We&#39;ve only had it a couple of days and he&#39;s loving playing with it, and I&#39;ve easily been able to modify it with the extra parts to build a double height tower.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Really, really impressive first set for making the transition from Duplo, and enjoyable to build even for an adult. Recommended.</p>
