I have a lot of &quot;good guys&quot; cruising around in the deep blue, but not enough evil ones to fight with. I like this set it impressed me more than I thought it would, and its fun to build too.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Imperial13","2007-06-29T10:33:01.14Z","Okay...","When i got this set way back the main set was the figs, and sub. While mine didn't come with a spear its still pretty good.

PROS:
figs
spear
ship

CONS:
didn't come with good guys
cockpit doesn't even seal
no deep sea animals


All in all it would have been better with more figs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Outcast","2008-07-10T14:33:24.107Z","Ogel's Only Submarine","This is the only Ogel submarine in the Mission Deep Sea line. All the rest are mutated sea creatures. Anyways, it's a good set that comes with 3 (!) drones and is fun to play with.

Pros:

-3 Drones
-Special drone pilot minifig with medal (I don't think he's in any other set)
-Lots of 'shark fin' pieces
-Trans-orange saws and 2 claws
-Orb dropping function adds to playability

Cons:

-Not air tight! (Common flaw with Mission Deep Sea)
-Only two scuba tanks
-Could have included some seaweed (like with the AT Aquatic Mech) or a small AT vehicle

All in all, this is a great set and even more fun if you have an AT vehicle.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-11T20:13:08.997Z","best alpha team ever made!","this set is increadible. first of all this set looks evil and nasty, the way it should. now im not a big fan of the minifigures but it comes with 3 or 4 and thats more than enough. i love the little orbs it has and the hands could do more than a little damage on the alpha teams stuff. if you happed to see one of these (i doubt it) definitly get it, its awsome

p.s. i know the cab doesnt seal but who cares, theyre skelitons they dont need air!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pepper","2008-02-26T17:56:20.543Z","IT DOES COME WITH A SPEAR!","I think that this was my first Alpha Team set. I got it at Wal-Mart a few years ago. Onto the the pros. and cons.<br/><br/>Pros.<br/>cool minifigs (three skeleton drones, one without an airtank, but that one has a badge)<br/>clear lime-green spear<br/>skeleton orb<br/>arms with claw and buzzsaw<br/>cool clear red pieces<br/><br/>Cons.<br/>needs good guys<br/>not the sturdiest<br/><br/>Overall, great set. LEGO should not have discontinued Alpha Team.",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T15:48:43.793Z","A lot is good, a lot is also bad...","This set has just as many flaws as it does pros. The set has no good guys, not a one, so there's one problem, it's a one sided fight (a single figure as well as maybe a mini watercraft would help).

The set has a partially open cockpit, and the set is stingy with scuba tanks, so the pilot, who is in the open cockpit, is most likely going to drown... (but aren't they alredy dead...)

The set isn't that sturdy, but has a great design, especially with the double fins in the back. The two arms are very posable, so there's another pro. 
--The two bars for the scouts can be reused as lightsabers (for you Star Wars geeks [which I am not!])--
The set also has some really cool features, like the claw, buzz saw, stow and go for the two minions, flip top for the back, and the really cool orb dropping function.

Overall, pretty good, giving that it only has bad guys...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-07T11:20:49.11Z","LEGO Alpha Team - Ogel Shark Sub Review","As most sets I got this one as a present. This set includes 3 skeleton warriors. One of them is exclusive to this set. This exclusive skeleton warrior has an badge on his torso. The whole sub looks very cool. It's sturdy and a nice built. The coolest thing are the arms on each side which you can sviwel. One arm has a two claws which are from the LEGO BIONICLE - Toa Onua set from 2001 and the other arm has a translucent orange chainsaw.<br><br>What I don't like about this set is that the cockpit isn't very closed. The windscreen piece and the translucent red computer piece which we get are very cool. I also like the way how you can transport the other two skeleton warriors in the trunk and the way how you drop the bomb.<br><br>All
in all this set is a grood model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"RCT3Dude96","2011-02-23T23:47:59.123Z","Submersables were never this cool!","My earlier Lego sets, but&nbsp; it still shines with win. If you have a good guy ship, then this set becomes even more awesome since it has an enemy. If not though, the sub can still be swooshed around. there are many unique pieces in the set, like the saws, the movable arms, and the cockpit. The set is a tad bit pricey, this could count as a 15$ set, but 20$ for 115 pieces is a bit much. Overall, it's a great set with intimidating features, and a somewhat high price. An awesome set to posses.<br>",TRUE,4,5,5,4,4
