<p>Glurt is a very weird-looking thing. He/she is very small, has pop-out eyes, a viny tail, and snake hands/guns(I have no idea what they&#39;re supposed to be), and black ears. The build is straightforward.</p>

<p>Parts: There are some really cool parts in here for 5 dollars. The lime green arches over the eyes, the viny tail, the snake hands, and the teeth are all really cool pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Glurt may be weird, but it is also is kind of cute in my opinion. However, it is probably more useful as a parts pack with all the cool pieces. You can buy it&nbsp;for 8 dollars now. By no means is Glurt a must-buy, but if you really like the look of it or you want the parts for a custom creation, I would definitely go for it and buy the set.&nbsp;</p>
