<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Mixels come in plastic packets like large-scale CMF bags. There is a nice vibrant image of the Mixel in question on the front, and their cartoon image along with their name is in the upper corner. The package has a cubit-shaped window in the front to view the parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are obstructively folded in half, making it quite difficult to use without flattening them first. Bad move, LEGO.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This one has some great ones! The car part/&quot;cockpit&quot; element used for the front of his body isn&#39;t exclusive, but not common. The V-shaped car&nbsp;part in Green used on his head is exclusive, and his &quot;nose&quot; and the large leg &quot;shells&quot; are uncommon. He comes with the three-tooth plate, and the eye-print Technic balls. There are two pairs of ball joint pieces&nbsp;(2x1) for the legs.&nbsp;The best parts in the set are the two transparent neon green&nbsp;<em>starfish</em>, used as slime splats!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple, but one lovely part of Torts&#39; construction&nbsp;is his large legs. Why? It allows the ball and cup joints to be switched on his body, which grants his legs forward movement as well as outward!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Character and slime ooze from this Mixel. He has a great look, some brilliant parts usage, and just looks good.</p>

<h3>Articulation</h3>

<p>His arms fold left and right, and his legs can rotate forward/backward and outward. His eyeballs can be adjusted for different degrees of zaniness. Again, a lot of expressiveness here!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This one is great. Terrific character, clever design, and overall fun make this the best Glorp Corp Mixel, and possibly the best one of Series 3!</p>
