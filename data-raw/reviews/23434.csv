<p>This set comes in a small box. The dimensions are 5.1 x 7.1 x 0.6 inches and weighs 0.11 pounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any cool or unique parts in this. The tan and dark tan pieces are really nice to get. You get two printed pieces in this set which are two 2x2 tile circles for Scorpi&#39;s eyes. The total piece count for the set is 70.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me&nbsp;around 5 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice Mixel. The spikes really add to it and the tail is really cool (hence the name). He has eight legs (six with black spikes and two with silver). His head rotates 360 degrees. The has two different connecting points that allow for great mobility and movement. Overall this is a really good Mixel. I recommend it for anybody who is a fan of the Mixels series. If you aren&#39;t this isn&#39;t a must-have, but still would be a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
