In this one, i think the source of the model&#39;s inspiration was a small dragon witch or something related due to the way the face is built up. However the things I was most impressed about this set were the parts, which I find very useful for custom MOCs and minifigs, in this case the unique parts being two of the witches hats and two of the cyclops minifig heads. However, apart from the parts the end result is also quite nice and I think Lego has portrayed this cartoon network character very well judging by the amount of pieces each mixel is built up on and the figure itself features the opening and closing mouth, the movement of wings, tail and feet and you can also make some great poses from it.</p>
