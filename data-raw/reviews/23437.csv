<p>I do like the trans purple parts and quite a few of the others, but you can&#39;t build too much else with just this set alone.</p>

<p>I would&nbsp;recommend this set mainly to Mixel collectors, or&nbsp;those who just want some special parts.<br />

<p>Minifig</p>

<p>This set contains no minifigures.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes in a small plastic packet. It is hard to open without ripping if you&#39;re a collector. The instructions are 25 pages long with easy to follow steps.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The parts are mostly purple and black. There are some white and blue pieces as well.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>The build is quite short and enjoyable, taking only between 5-7 minutes. There is a lot of repetition in the build.</p>

<p>Completed model</p>

<p>This is my favourite model in the series. He has two light sabre&nbsp;translucent purple as wands. He has a cone shaped wizard&#39;s hat. There are two pointed teeth and a printed single eye. There is also a mini monster that is not shown on the packet.</p>

<p>This set is definitely one to get, for MOCs or not.</p>
