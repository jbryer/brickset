<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The standard Mixels packet, showing off the physical model, the cartoon, and a window for the parts. The instructions are annoyingly folded up, making them a challenge to hold open.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Wizwuz has some nice pieces. The coveted purple parts are a 2x2 round brick, a V-fin car piece, a sloped car front, 6 small bows, and a 2x3 plate. He includes the Technic-ball eyes, and the three-toothed plate. The other standout part is the Chima energy blade in transparent light blue. The ball joints are used on the abdomen and the hook.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly simple, and it&#39;s only repetitive for the six legs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He&#39;s a good little Mixel. If you hang him (or hold him by the hook) he looks great, and the expression is better than you think it would be. The magic breath adds a lot to his appearance as well, and he&#39;s probably the friendliest spider(like) creature LEGO has made.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Articulation</h3>

<p>His head hinges upward, and his lower jaw can move up and down. His eyes can be rotated for different expressions, and each of his legs (6) can be moved up and down on their connections. His abdomen is on a ball joint, and his hook is too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s the most articulated of the tribe, and I love his design, but the character of Mesmo and Magnifo seems to outdo him where there poses lack. Still, don&#39;t pass him up, since he is still a good Mixel.</p>
