"Cheshire_axolotl","2014-07-24T16:27:52.17Z","Excellent Playability and Travel-Friendly Vehicle","<p>Riverside Raid was a bit of an impulse &lsquo;buy&rsquo;. I wanted something small so, if I loved it enough to keep it out, I wouldn&rsquo;t have to sweat about finding space on my (heaving) Lego shelves. The new ultra-agents theme looks pretty sleek and I figured this would be a good taster&hellip; Plus, I had &pound;10 on my VIP card. Win!</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>First off, I&rsquo;m over a decade over the target audience, but I can immediately see the appeal in this chase vehicle. The build was quick but quite fun, minus the triggers (see below), and the final product serves as both a rather bulky &lsquo;quad bike&rsquo; (not shaped like any quad bike I&rsquo;ve ridden!) and a &lsquo;jet speeder&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, I quite like the watercraft. What remains of the quad bike on the split leaves a lot of be desired though and I wish they&rsquo;d dispensed of this &lsquo;two-in-one&rsquo; approach and given poor Adam a vehicle instead. It&rsquo;s going to be a short chase unless he&rsquo;s got super speedy feet!</p>

<p>As a standalone set, this is perfect. We have the basic ingredients of hero, villain and vehicle. Bike-mode has raised rear wheels to keep the winch clear from the floor (the hook securely tucks into the body of the jetski, so it won&rsquo;t drag) and it runs about nicely on thick rubber wheels: smooth floors, thick carpeting and even over grass/gravel outdoor surfaces. In addition to this are two grey crates with handles, our villain needs something to steal after all, the contents of which advertised as the agent&rsquo;s &lsquo;mission&rsquo; for the set.</p>

<p>Crates aside, this vehicle is relatively sturdy and, if you pop off the shooters and two blue &lsquo;Parabolic Elements&rsquo; (*4581214*) at the rear, it should survive fully intact in pockets and backpacks. My cats stole this from the top of a bookcase, over a 6ft drop, and must have been batting it about all morning - it&rsquo;s none the worse for wear.</p>

<p><strong>It&rsquo;s Not Flick Missiles! </strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never come across the &lsquo;trigger for mini shooters&rsquo; (*6051334*) before and this was a new one for me. At first I assembled the guns with just the 1x1 round trans orange bricks popped into the white mini shooter (*6076599*) and wondered what on earth these odd left-over grey pieces were. A quick flick back through the instructions later and I&rsquo;d corrected my mistake. But what were they? Needless to say, after accidently shooting myself in the eye&hellip; Yeah... &nbsp;Just be aware they actually fire with a fair amount of oomph.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures: Surprisingly Sweet for a Small Set.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Adam Acid</strong> is certainly the highlight here, with his trans-green head and half&rsquo;n&rsquo;half face. He isn&rsquo;t a pretty villain, but he&rsquo;s quite unique to look at with those gritted perfect/deteriorated teeth. The theme continues down into his torso with an across-the-body belt of (toxic/acid?) bombs and a green left arm that apparently has melted through his hoodie sleeve. Oddly though, his hoodie sleeve on his good arm extends down to his hand (Wearing one grey glove perhaps? Michael Jackson fan?). The nice torso print continues onto the back: the hood, the across-the-body weapon belt with a securing buckle and further &lsquo;melt&rsquo; about that left shoulder. The legs are unprinted, standard dark blue &lsquo;jeans&rsquo;, and not the grey legs seen in some photos. From an AFOL perspective, he makes a nice fit with the Monster Fighters, especially about the &lsquo;crazy scientist&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Max Burns</strong> was always going to struggle in comparison. His legs are printed, with a chain (Pocketwatch? Wallet?) and a bright agent belt buckle. The torso has back-printing with the collar and tailoring folds of the jacket; the front has some charming touches. A slightly scruffier take on a suit, the tie has been loosened with the top shirt button undone and his Agent (ID?) lanyard is hastily pinned at an angle. Add in ginger &lsquo;surfer&rsquo; hair and a double-sided head (smirky open smile and determined frown, *Head No.1489*), kids will love him&hellip;. Me, not so much: he looks far too arrogant and green!</p>

<p>His hair now belongs to a nice young lady; his head now belongs to a mean-spirited child throwing balls at the 10244 Fairground Mixer&rsquo;s dunk tank &nbsp;and that wonderful scruffy suit now belongs to what I define as &lsquo;glasses-wearing hard-working single-dad&rsquo; minifigure trying to kick back after work with his kid at the fairground. Bless him, he&rsquo;s actually so stressed out, he&rsquo;s forgotten to take off his office ID!</p>

<p>The torso really has a great look and I&rsquo;m definitely tempted to grab a few more to populate either a decently sized stag party or a post-office take-out run.</p>

<p><strong>Overall: Excellent Playability and Travel-Friendly</strong></p>

<p>This is a great little set. Outside of the minifigures there&rsquo;s nothing really here for the AFOL, but grab it for the kids. Whether for at home, or to take built on holiday, this will definitely be a hit. Chances are, they&rsquo;ll need a hand with the string as this is fiddly &ndash; isn&rsquo;t it always! - but there&rsquo;s a great amount of play to be had here. &nbsp;I imagine washing sand out of the wheels will be a bit of a mission if it&rsquo;s running about on the beach (but you can replace sandcastles with sand-hideouts and sand-highways!) and after outdoor play, you might be wiping tire-tracks off the walls and furnishings when the chase gets heated, but it&rsquo;s genuinely fun and welcomingly robust.</p>

<p>Just watch out for those shooters!</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2014-09-09T22:50:43.647Z","Better living through chemistry.","<p>I truly believe that there is something about spies and supervillains that is&nbsp;inherently appealing to the 11 year old boy in all of us - and if you disagree, then why are you reading this review? The golden age of the outlandish super spy being pitted against maniacs living in volcano lairs may have been extinguished with the emergence of gritty and &quot;realistic&quot; thrillers like Jason Bourne and his ilk, but those of us who remain in arrested development will always have an affiliation for men and women of dubious morals who dress cool and use shiny, high-tech gadgets and machines to stop the bad guys from taking over the world. It&#39;s timeless.</p>

<p>And since Marvel&#39;s&nbsp;<em><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D."">Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>&nbsp;</em>has failed spectacularly to deliver in that regard, we are once again left adrift to find new super spy outlets. But lo! The toy gods of Denmark have heard our cries, and out rolls Ultra Agents, LEGO&#39;s own homegrown version of the super spy organisation. I was personally mired in my &quot;dark ages&quot; during the first iteration of Agents, so I was immensely thrilled to hear that LEGO was giving the theme another go-around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Riverside Raid is the smallest set in this wave (with more to follow, I hope), and thus is likely to serve as an introduction to the theme for many a casual buyer. While licensed themes will frequently shuttle off three or sometimes even four Minifigs in a tiny set like this one, nonlicensed themes tend to be a bit more conservative. Of course, it would be impossible to advance a conflict-driven theme without a goodie and a baddie to pit against each other, and so here we have Agent Max Burns going up against the Toxic Avenger...er, that is, Adam Acid. These Minifigs are superb, and the MOC potential is just off the charts. Up until now there have been a mere handful of City Minifigs sporting any attire that could pass for the &quot;man in black&quot; look, and now we are simply spoiled for choice. Adam Acid - silly name aside - is just as cool, though his see-through head and mismatched arms may appeal more to kids than to grownups. It&#39;s actually a bit creepy, but there&#39;s still a bit of yellow &quot;flesh&quot; printing left on him, meaning that this dude is literally being burned alive by acid...bit violent, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>The main build here is a little ATV-esque vehicle that actually looks pretty good on its own. The key gimmick here is that the top half of the vehicle can break apart and turn into a boat, so the scenario here is presumably that Agent Burns is chasing Adam along a dockside of some kind and Adam somehow escapes into the river, prompting Burns to give chase by detaching the boat from the chassis beneath it. Some imagination is certainly required since Mr. Acid clearly has no boat of his own, so you might have to cannibalise an appropriate one from <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60058-1/SUV-with-Watercraft"">elsewhere</a>. It&#39;s a neat idea that&#39;s well-executed for a small set, though quite frankly I much prefer the complete design as opposed to the boat being detached since what remains looks incredibly naked without it. And since this is an &quot;action&quot; theme, you get two crates with mysterious radioactive containers in them as an obligatory action setpiece. Fun for the whole family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is unusual in that it hovers tentatively between two set cliches: it&#39;s more expensive than a typical (nonlicensed) impulse buy, but it&#39;s not quite a &quot;battle pack&quot; either. It&#39;s not hideously overpriced overall, but I can see that some may hesitate. It&#39;s a cool set with great Minifigs in its own right, but if you can find it for a couple bucks off, that would probably be better still. I&#39;m pretty satisfied with Ultra Agents so far, and I hungrily anticipate more.&nbsp;</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-19T13:36:11.37Z","Quad Bike Spy Action!!!!","<p>I like this set. The build is simple and produces a slightly ungainly oversized quad bike relative to the minifig.</p>

<p>There is a nice selection of trans blue parts and a couple of stud shooters.</p>

<p>The upper chassis looks to me like it could separate into a boat / jet ski to chase villains over water, which is some nice extra playability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The &quot;baddie&quot; minifig is an ugly looking critter with limited weaponary.</p>

<p>The &quot;goodie&quot; minifig has hair that makes him look newly recruited and&nbsp;very young.</p>

<p>Pros -&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simple for younger fans.</p>

<p>Extra land and water playability.</p>

<p>Winch fun too.</p>

<p>Cons -&nbsp;</p>

<p>Physically big relative to the minifig (it&#39;s taller than a car almost).&nbsp;</p>
