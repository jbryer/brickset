"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-27T06:19:40Z","Uh, what is it?","I got this in a 3 dollar ziplock bag at savers mixed together with loads of megabloks. It was broken up into several sub-assemblies and frankly, i didnt know what to make of it. at first i thought that it was a smaller sub similar to the ogel one and all the extra canopies were from some other sets.

Eventually i found instructions and i was horrified with what i came up with. i never thought lego would actually put out an open-air subamarine with unprotected divers... but.. there it was. Just about the only regular pieces in the set are a handful of plates. the set relies heavily on specialized pieces and would only reccommend it to those looking specifically for those parts

The good:
Uh, lots of interesting parts, lots of canopies
A minifig torso with dynamite strapped on...
Green and red transparent cylinders

The bad:
Open cockpit design
streamlined canopy lines but a totally ungraceful layout.
Specialized pieces are mostly in limited-application yellow

The ugly:
Buying this at full price",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-16T18:14:14Z","JUNORIZED","THe set is VERY JUNORIZED the open air part is the worst especially when you buy it with all your money definatly not to good although it has some nice features to it such as the cargo box and litle robot submarine things.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Republic_Commando_Sev","2007-08-02T11:33:32.207Z","Okay","My sister got this set for christmas. I don't like it! The Cockpits are open on the side. The streamlining isn't to good, and it breaks apart and it should come with three not two minifigs! Good thing I got it for one third the price!
Pros:
Minifigs,
Pieces,
Saws
Cons:
Breaks a lot,
Streamlining,
Cockpits are open on side,
Don't get it full priece!

"smiley905","2007-12-28T19:43:02.7Z","this set is ok","i like it, i think the two robots on the side is the coolest part, and it needs 1 more guy, because if both of the robots are being used theres no one to drive. the arms are wierd, it makes it look less like a sub, and more like a giant robot. it has a lot of proppelers which is good, and the storage case is cool. i dont like the little &quot;lab&quot; in the middle it is completly open and all the computers would mess up. i like this set, but it could be much better",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Agent_Flex_the_Lego_lover","2008-01-30T19:05:00.497Z","Very cool set","This set is very cool. It is one big sub orcan be tooken apart and made into a smaller sub. This is done by taking the front and the back of the middle and puting them to gether. It also has 2 little robots that come of the side. They can explore little caves or fix the sub if its broken.
The 2 alpha team agents that come with it are very cool. This set coms with scuba geer and a lettle water thing that can be used by the figs to swim around very fast.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Planetsbend","2010-11-17T18:18:18.433Z","One of my most favorite Alpha Team sets.","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>This set has many great small pieces such as scuba gear and the ability to take the small one-manned vehicles is pretty cool. As well as taking apart the ship and connecting different parts. An awesome addition to any lego collector's collection.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
