"Gnackfotzler","2014-11-02T20:42:41.9Z","5 Stars for Design and Playability","<p>I have all the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit sets but somehow this one inspired&nbsp;me to spontaneously write my first review.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I like the green box design&nbsp;used for this &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; wave better than all the previous waves because it looks just a bit more polished. As usual,&nbsp;the front of the box shows an&nbsp;overview&nbsp;of the whole set. While I scratched my head at&nbsp;the&nbsp;&quot;Boat does not float&quot;-warning right under the name of the set,&nbsp;my four year old daughter spotted a nice little detail which is&nbsp;the&nbsp;shadow of the dragon Smaug spitting fire in the background. The back of the box shows several images&nbsp;of all the playability features. Inside are two bigger numbered bags and two smaller unnumbered ones.</p>

<p>The (single) instruction booklet&nbsp;has&nbsp;the same green design as the box. Maybe it is my old eyes&nbsp;but I always find a strain on my eyes trying&nbsp;to discern the dark brown from the red brown bricks in the images for the construction steps.&nbsp;That goes not just for the instructions for this set but for all of them. Also, I have to add that I usually find the warning signs not to shoot each other in the eyes a bit superfluous. However, after trying the&nbsp;new spring-loaded shooter which is included I understand why it is needed.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Speaking of the spring-loaded shooter:&nbsp;After all the relatively lame (in terms of shooting-action) mini-catapults in previous Lord of the Rings and Hobbit sets, this part&nbsp;really surprised me. It is easy to load and when I fire it from&nbsp;the edge of&nbsp;a 1 meter high table, the projectile flies almost 4 meters far before it hits the ground. That thing would&nbsp;take the real Smaug down!</p>

<p>The other parts which I find noteworthy&nbsp;are&nbsp;the&nbsp;dark&nbsp;brown 2x2x2 bow plates, the dark&nbsp;grey slide handle, the 3x6 earth green angle plates, the gold lattice windows in the earth green frames, and the silver metal parabolic reflector.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are five minifigs included and they are all unique and&nbsp;superb. What I like about&nbsp;Bard and his son Bain are their two-sided heads. Not only do they have two different facial expressions on each respective side. Also, the alternate faces are &quot;dirty&quot;, supposedly to reflect all the ash and dirt from the fight against the fiery&nbsp;dragon. Tauriel has a new&nbsp;greener&nbsp;outfit and her good-looking red elven hair. A perfect addition are also the two Hunter Orcs with their new hair pieces, in my opinion the best hair pieces for Orcs so far.</p>

<h3>The build and the completed model</h3>

<p>What I really enjoyed about this build was that it gradually builds up the playability features. First, there is the expected break-away wall and ladder. Then, there is a little lamp on the right that&nbsp;you can turn to throw some burning stuff onto the Orcs (or the good guys - depending on which side you&#39;re on). Then, there is a&nbsp;barrel swinging on a rope which can be used&nbsp;to hit them over the head. I loved the bell in the top of the tower which is not fixed but can swing, as well. Then comes the&nbsp;green roof of the tower which I find beautiful. And then, at the very end, comes the ballista which shoots the black arrow. It could have been introduced&nbsp;a lot earlier in the instructions because it is not on top of the tower, only in the middle. But I must admit that this actually managed to build&nbsp;up a bit of&nbsp;suspension in this&nbsp;AFOL chest of mine.&nbsp;Optically, I find that this set&nbsp;represents Lake-town very adequately. The red and dark brown, the earth green and the specks of new dark red make the structures&nbsp;look refined and realistic. On top of all that, combining this set with 79013 Lake-town Chase, is enough to build a nice little lake-town. They really go together very well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The minifigs, the build, the look and the playability leave nothing else to wish for in a licensed&nbsp;set of this price range, not just for collectors.</p>

"disorientedperson","2015-01-01T14:23:48.3Z","Great set, a few gripes","<p>I received this set for Christmas, and thought I&#39;d give it a review.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box for this wave of Hobbit sets&nbsp;is my favorite out of the three waves. The green just looks good. There is one simple instruction booklet; it&#39;s nothing special.</p>

<h3><b>Parts</b></h3>

<p>I only give this section four stars because there are a couple of places where the coloring is inconsistent. First is the 1x1 slope on the bridge rail. If you look at the picture, you&#39;ll notice that it is lighter brown than the rest of the rail. Now, I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to see the movie, so maybe there&#39;s a <i>huge deal&nbsp;</i>in the film about a discolored bridge rail. But I don&#39;t think so. :P My other complaint is that the barrel is topped by a lighter brown. I&#39;m a bit disappointed, because this is a <em>great</em> set, and I think that&#39;s a detail that LEGO shouldn&#39;t have overlooked.</p>

<h3><b>Minifigures</b></h3>

<p>These minifigs are beautifully&nbsp;designed, and are exclusive to this set according to brickset. Bard is the same as from the last Lake-town set, except, I assume, the back face is different. The Tauriel&nbsp;fig I could really do without, but that&#39;s just an opinion. If we have to have her, at least it&#39;s different than the one from Mirkwood&nbsp;Spiders. The orcs&nbsp;have great printing but they&#39;re nothing special; orcs are just orcs. The only character exclusive to this set is Bain (Bard&#39;s son). It&#39;s a fine figure, and interestingly the only child from the Hobbit (though there are none in the book). I don&#39;t understand why the hair is orange; it looks more brown to me in the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>The Build</b></h3>

<p>Nothing really stood out to me during the building process; it&#39;s fairly simple and I don&#39;t really have any thoughts about it.</p>

<h3><b>The completed model</b></h3>

<p>The model is fun and has many play features. However, in my opinion, it doesn&#39;t work very well on display. Here I have listed the play features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Swinging barrel</li>
	<li>Falling lava? from opening of door</li>
	<li>Crossbow with Black Arrow&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Wall that breaks</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Overall opinion</b></h3>

<p>This is an decent set, and while I have a few complaints, I would recommend this to all Hobbit fans.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-11-02T15:27:26.13Z","The Fall of Smaug?","<p><strong>Set #79016 Attack on Lake-Town: </strong>Sadly it would appear that the license for Middle-Earth will be no more, so if you&rsquo;re a fan you definitely want to pick up the entire series. Some of which is not as well thought out as others, however this set is one of the better sets from the Hobbit Theme. You want to know why? Read on and find out.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The Battle of the Five Armies have a new green box design compared with Desolation of Smaug&rsquo;s bluer toned boxes. The lonely mountain is seen in the background of the upper section of the box where the logos are. You also see part of the fortress&hellip; Or possibly the ruins of Dale it&rsquo;s difficult to say for sure because the set blocks off this logo.</p>

<p>I enjoy the design choices for each film of the LEGO Hobbit boxes, as it allows us to witness the journey that Bilbo has and helps differentiate them from the other Themes on the shelves.</p>

<p>The instructions include a minifigure checklist, nice cross-promotional images of the other sets in this wave and details the build of the set in both numbered bags which is how the set is broken up. It&rsquo;s a standard design and works very well for this theme, I&rsquo;m just sad that we only had four sets from this year.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set is chock full of awesome parts, loads of brown and some dark green bricks of all types as well as a few plates. We also get one of those new spring-loaded shooters, a piece that has some controversy, yet at least isn&rsquo;t as out of place in this set compared to the flick-fire missiles they included in the Mirkwood Elf Army set from 2013. However that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s five minifigures in this set, three heroes and two villains. But some great selection here nevertheless.</p>

<p>Hunter Orcs: Identical printing on the pair of them with double-sided torsos, some minimal leg printing around the waist and single sided facial expressions. Each of them have different accessories, one has the large flat grey scimitar and the other has your standard quiver and bow from LEGO Castle. The best thing about this pair of Orcs is that they introduce a brand new hairpiece. It&rsquo;s a nice scraggly looking dirty mangy piece of hair, it&rsquo;s a pretty decent new sculpt and I love it, can&rsquo;t wait to see what LEGO might re-use this hair for.</p>

<p>Tauriel: We&rsquo;ve seen this lady elf before, and aside from her head, hair and elven bow the rest of her is brand new. Brand new with a nice double-sided torso print and some printed legs. I enjoy this new minifigure, her body print is less obviously feminine and so could be used for elf army building if you were inclined to buy doubles of this set. My one nitpicky comment would be that it is a bright shade of green and brown compared to the rest of the Mirkwood Elves we&rsquo;ve gotten previously.</p>

<p>Bard the Bowman: Bard is a pretty great minifigure too, he&rsquo;s got some nice leg printing adding to his coat print on the torso print and the undershirt is also shown across torso and leg prints. He has some nice back printing too, the only problem is the double-sided facial print. One side is normal and might be a smile, the other is gritted scuffed up and dirty. Which is not bad, it looks great, but since the torso doesn&rsquo;t have any &lsquo;battle damage&rsquo; printing it kind of stands out more.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think the hairpiece is the same, however it does bear a similar look to Qui-Gon&rsquo;s hair over in Star Wars, the sculpt is similar I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s meant to be the same. Accessory wise the Bowman has, you guessed it, a bow. Interestingly the larger elven bow instead of the standard Castle style long bow, which is a nice change and shows that this human may have some real talent with the bow. (Which of course he does, as seen in the films.)</p>

<p>Bain son of Bard: A short legged child minifigure, Bain has a double-sided torso and a double-sided facial print, similar to his father one of them plain and smiling and the other is scruffy and dirty from battling the orcs. Honestly I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded seeing the torso print have some of the dirt these faces have so that they wouldn&rsquo;t stand out so oddly. He has a fish for his accessory, not to eat mind you, but to smack the orcs around.</p>

<p>A solid group of minifigures here and the hunter orcs have some great new hair pieces that don&rsquo;t have the pointy ears, so have more use for other minifigures outside of the orcs.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>As I said the build is broken up between two numbered bags. Each bag builds up one section of the area of Lake-Town that this small story is meant to tell, the opening battle from the film where Bard is trying to use the black-tipped arrow to destroy Smaug.</p>

<p>As I haven&rsquo;t picked up the earlier set comparing this to Lake-Town Chase will not be possible, so we&rsquo;ll discuss this build as a standalone. The build is pretty impressive actually, creating a section of a building that is located on the edge of a lake. It can be a pretty repetitive build in some areas, though minor repetition is necessary to make a building of this type.</p>

<p>I love the build of this set honestly it works when it becomes a solid final model, however during the build itself it feels like you&rsquo;re making something really great; it&rsquo;s a solid build compared to some of the weaker Hobbit sets such as the weaker Barrel Escape set.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The final build for this set is a very impressive looking building with a bridge connecting both areas, which is typical of Lake-Town building designs. There are a lot of play features for this set that actually integrate with the build quite nicely. On the shorter side of the build there&rsquo;s a breakaway wall with a ladder on to protect against the hunter orcs, just above that is a spinning barrel on a rope that can be used to attack the orcs.</p>

<p>Open the door on the larger side of the model with the roof and some translucent orange studs will fall out on your head, probably meant to show the orcs being burnt by fire or molten lead or something. And there&rsquo;s the large crossbow with the spring-loaded missile, you get two in the set in case you lose it. As I said the play features are integrated into the set quite nicely and don&rsquo;t detract from the general look of the model, compared to play features, such as the large trap in Dol Guldur Ambush which is just a bit too large for that set.</p>

<p>The colour scheme of this model is also quite nice the light and dark browns with the dark green roof and the white accents just looks awesome. There&rsquo;s little to see and do &lsquo;inside&rsquo; of the model, the house or whatever it&rsquo;s meant to be is a bit cramped because of the size. Compared to what was shown in the movie with the large tower, this is an unfortunately off scale model, however that doesn&rsquo;t detract from what you get in the set and it comes together quite nicely. The price is also right for some doubling up and expanding on Lake-Town a bit with moded versions of the build, since Lake-Town Chase was such a larger set and impractical for that purpose. This set compliments the previous set from Desolation perfectly.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I really can&rsquo;t praise this set enough, it&rsquo;s a solid model with some great minifigures that I recommend buying multiples of just to expand on Lake-Town in your Hobbit displays. A shame we didn&rsquo;t get much from this wave, there&rsquo;s no Dale and the Erebor builds aren&rsquo;t much compared to what is shown in the films. Still, it&rsquo;s nice to see Hobbit going out on such a strong note, with this, the Battle of Five Armies and the set with Smaug it&rsquo;s a solid wave that I recommend in all. This one you can&rsquo;t go wrong with.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-09-20T06:45:46.94Z","The Pictures Don’t do This Set Justice","<p>So I only recently discovered how amazing the LOTR line was and have been purchasing sets I can get for a bargain. This set however had zero appeal to me. The minifigures weren&rsquo;t anything special (Bard and Bain just aren&rsquo;t as exciting as dwarves or members of the Fellowship), but even worse, the pictures of this set made it look terrible. Well when I saw the set for $8 (minus minifigures of course) I had to get it, and oh boy am I glad I did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is actually an incredibly well designed set that looks beautiful, and while it does have a very clear front and back, the back of this set isn&rsquo;t terrible, it just lacks the details you see on the other 3 sides. Plus it offers tons of playability for a relatively small set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build</b></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t expect to be blown away here, there is nothing to revolutionary here other than a really nice slanted roof. However, there is nothing symmetrical about this set meaning that nothing is repeated! You build the set in sections which is pretty cool as you can see the whole thing come together. And while you may not have any mind blowing techniques, it is a fairly complex build due to the fact you are building with very thin walls. As I&rsquo;ve discovered with almost all LOTR&nbsp;sets, it is the building experience that makes this line awesome.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Model</b></p>

<p>The pictures of this set made it look very two dimensional to me, but that certainly isn&rsquo;t the case. Yes, the back could use more details, but certainly that is something you could fix yourself. But it is truly amazing how many play features got packed into this set. You have a breakaway wall with a ladder. A swinging bucket that offers a full range of motion. A booby trapped door that drops stuff on invading orcs. A bell that can be swung and does make a plastic knocking sound.&nbsp;And finally the bow and arrow used to kill Smaug. The last one is the only disappointment and it is very minor. It uses a spring loaded missile with black missiles which I love, but it can only be aimed vertically, it has no horizontal motion. Now it is in a very tight space making it difficult to get a full range of motion, but I&rsquo;m going to try my best to solve this problem because it should be doable with a ball socket.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I do recommend this set.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have Lake Town Chase, but quite honestly I feel this is a better set as it offers you the most important location in Lake Town and it is composed of two buildings and a bridge which is more than sufficient in representing this location. I would have liked a larger boat, not just a dingy, but anything larger would have been oversized for this set and detracted from the structures.</p>

<p>This may not be my favorite LOTR set, but it has some pretty stiff competition. It&rsquo;s a great mid-sized set and a lot of fun.&nbsp;While I wouldn&rsquo;t pay a fortune for it, it is certainly worth much more than $8 I paid for it.</p>
