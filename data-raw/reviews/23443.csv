<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The primary model</h3>

<p>The bulldozer turns out quite nicely, with a raising/lowering plow in front, a raising/lowering furrow-digging tool in the back, and a four-piston engine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scale is ridiculous. The seat only&nbsp;fits a microfigure or smaller, and assuming a microfigure is five feet tall - just imagine a three story tall bulldozer in your driveway. If you ignore the scale, this really is quite nice, though.</p>

<p>A gear differential is used to connect both tracks to the piston engine and ensure that the tracks can move independently.</p>

<h3>The secondary model</h3>

<p>The secondary model is a &quot;trench digger&quot;. I&#39;ve never heard of these vehicles before, but in this case it is a tracked vehicle with a spinning set of blades that can lowered to the ground behind it to dig a trench as it goes.</p>

<p>The gear digging toll looks quite strange (mostly because it&#39;s cobbled together from leftover parts), but the truck looks quite nice without it (The tool is easily removed).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scale is much more proportionate here than in the bulldozer.</p>

<p>Again, the gear differential will keep the piston engine moving even when one track is not moving. As with the bulldozer, the tracks run very smoothly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set includes 62 large track links (and 6 small sprockets), a large yellow technic panel used in the bulldozer&#39;s plow and the trench digger&#39;s roof, and a gear differential, to connect the tracks to the piston engine and allow them to move in different directions.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t many gears in this set, following what seems to be a trend for TECHNIC sets - more of the functions are becoming less reliant on gears and others are becoming more gear efficient.</p>

<p>There is the usual assortment of Technic parts and connectors here, and 4 small gear racks used for engine vents.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Great assortment of Technic parts, at a great piece to price ratio</li>
	<li>Plenty of large track pieces</li>
	<li>A nice looking working four-piston engine</li>
	<li>Looks great&nbsp;<em>without</em>&nbsp;the stickers</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>Scale is&nbsp;<em>way</em>&nbsp;too far off</li>
	<li>Lowering furrow digging and trench digging tools can&#39;t really be used without damage to the pieces, so they&#39;re really just decoration</li>
	<li>It&#39;s yellow. Seriously, this would&#39;ve looked so much better in red</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I would definitely recommend this set to TECHNIC fans and MOCers.</p>
