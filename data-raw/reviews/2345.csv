"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-12T05:34:32.237Z","LEGO Alpha Team - Ogel Underwater Base and AT Sub Review","This set is a very awsome set which I enjoy a lot. We get 4 minifigs in this set. Two of them are Ogel's skeleton warriors which are very basic to the LEGO Alpha Team theme. The third minifig is Ogel who is a very basic LEGO Alpha Team character as well. The last minifig is agent Dash who comes with his scuba-gear and his Alpha Team uniform. The yellow sub which Dash is driving is a little bit too small. It has no weapons so he won't have any chance to defend himself. There're also no controls inside the cockpit so how is he going to control his sub?<br><br>The base for Ogel is much cooler. We get a secret entrance on the back. The 'wall' does sviwel and it has a sticker. The skull on the front does open too. On the top we have some propellers which sviwel and a sviwel flick-missile canon. The base does open if you want to work in the inside of that building. We get a place where you can create some bombs which is like a laboratory. I also like the dark gray trident pieces which we've seen in the Turaga Nokama set from the LEGO BIONICLE theme. I really can't complain much about this set. The only thing which I would have changed is that the sub of agent Dash. I think there should be some controls in the inside of the cockpit and the sub should have gotten some weapons to attack Ogel's base.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"LegoMunchy88","2011-06-12T12:42:18.923Z","A Pretty Good Set","<p>Ogel's Underwater Base and AT Sub is a nice set, but not the most exciting thing ever. The best part of the set is the playability, the story can go on and on, even with just this set alone. Unlike most sets, you can have an hour-long story with just this set. Now, onto the review. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>Ogel-My favorite Ogel of the three versions, the only difference being the red transparent hook. The gold visor is also nice, and included with all Ogels. </p>
<p>Dash-I think Dash has a nicer face in the Snow Alpha Team, but the better body of the three series. </p>
<p>Skeleton Drones- Some of the best minions in any secret-agent vs. villian series, the best being the transparent spear and the helmet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p>The set, once again, is great for playing with, but doesn't have too many special pieces. The build is a big repetitive, as well as the design, being mainly four exactly the same curved sections. The outside includes a skull, which is nice, and a cannon, which I really like. Although the cannon is supposed to be used to hit the AT sub, it's also fun to shoot Dash with it. It also have those four nice transparent viewscreen pieces, but I think the should have either had no animal pictured on it, or make the animals pictured different on each one.&nbsp;I mean, the sea isn't semetrical, right? The inside has nice control panel pieces, but they're hidden away in the far corners of the set. The bomb-building thing is nice, but nothing special. The best part of the set is the blue revolving door/portal piece, but I'm not sure what it actually is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>Overall, the Ogel Underwater Base and AT Sub is a great set for those who like to play with their sets, but not the best for parts, and the build is extremely repetitive. I like it, though, and personally think that it's the best set of all the Alpha Team sets, but that really isn't saying much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
