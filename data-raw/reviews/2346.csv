"legozander","2007-04-05T05:23:57.82Z","Fantastic.","I really like old alpha team sets like these. This one being one of my favourites. The good: Cool tentacle peices. Two Onua mata claws. Transpearent yellow spear. Cool Ogel minifig(Anyone reailse Ogel is lego spelt backwards?). Cool transpearent cockpit peices. Also the cockpit can detach from the rest of the set! The bad: Nothing! A great set with no problems. Well done Lego!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Outcast","2008-07-10T14:39:05.03Z","Mutant or Robotic?","The one thing about this set that confuses me is that it is called a 'Mutant Squid' and yet Ogel can go inside and there is a computer! So is it a Mutant Squid or a Robotic Squid??

Pros:

-Ogel minifig with trans-red hook
-2 trans-light green jewels!
-Tentacle pieces
-Trans-light green spear
-2 binoculars

Cons:

-Mutant or robot?
-Could have came with an orb

Overall this is a great set! Buy it if you can!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-31T11:33:57.923Z","LEGO Alpha Team - Ogel Mutant Squid Review","I know the set looks cool but it's not my favourite set of the LEGO Alpha Team theme. As in each Alpha Team set you can find a comic in the instructions. This set comes with a minifig called Ogel (it's LEGO spelled backwards). He is the leader of the bad guys and he looks very evil too.<br><br>As I told you: the sub of Ogel looks cool but it's not my favourite because this set doesn't have many play features and because the cockpit isn't shut completely. What I like about this set are the mouth with the claw pieces of Toa Onua from the LEGO BIONICLE theme and the tentacles which are from the LEGO Dinosaurs theme. The eyes are made out of binoculars and we also get two gems in this set. This model is very sturdy and it has no stickers.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full galery I made for this set

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-26T12:46:11.913Z","Evil Ogel Leads the Attack","<p>Set #4796 Ogle Mutant Squid: I have found that this set makes for a wonderful LEGO toy and a great addition to my Alpha Team Mission Deep Sea collection. It is simple and quick to build features a lot of great looking pieces and manages to give hours of fun for anyone. (Even AFOLs have to play around with their LEGO sometimes.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is also a cheap way to get the Mini-Figure of Ogel, the evil enemy of the Alpha Team. I'm not sure whether this is intended to represent an actual living breathing animal or a strange mixture of organic and mechanical submersible craft, like a Biomechanical Squid or something. But it looks impressively evil either way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This version of Ogel has a ruby crystal hook for a hand as well. (I suspect he's similar to Doctor Claw from the live action Inspector Gadget film, comes with multiple mechanical hands to menace his enemies on the Alpha Team with.) He includes a fancy armored vest using the peice from the UFO Aliens mini-figures and a gold chromed mask. (Kind of makes for an interesting Cobra Commander look.) The set also includes a transparent green spear and two pairs of binoculars which are part of the squid, unless you build an alternate model using the parts then Ogel can use them as accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say this set is definitely worth owning and the transparent red pieces give off a definite sinister vibe for this Mutant Squid Biomechanical Submarine thing. If you're just starting out with underwater themes using the newer Atlantis sets I strongly recommend you consider bolstering them up a bit with some of these classic underwater theme sets. And you can't go wrong with the Ogel Mutant Squid. Also, Ogel is Lego spelled backwards... Best name for a Lego Villain ever!</p>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,4
"BrickbyBrickDFM","2020-05-17T06:25:12.477Z","First Alpha Team Set... Great Introduction! ","<p>Alpha Team set 4796 (Ogel Mutant Squid) was a great introduction for me to this series. &nbsp;The Ogel (LEGO spelled backwards) minifigure had an amazing&nbsp;sinister look to it. &nbsp;The one red eye and red hook hand made him the star of the set. &nbsp;It is a small build, but got some unique pieces in this set. &nbsp;It is neat that Ogel&#39;s underwater ship has the long black squid like tentacles. &nbsp;The art work on the box stands out with the metal border&nbsp;and the dark underwater bubbles/flames. &nbsp;It is a small set (56 pieces), but worth the price. I have bought additional Alpha Team sets because of this first set. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
