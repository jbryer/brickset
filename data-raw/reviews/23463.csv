<p>So, overall, not bad decoration for a figure. The stripe pattern is repeated on the back of the body, as well as on the arms and even on the sides of his legs.</p>

<p>He is also &quot;two-faced&quot;, with the wink and smile expression that is shown on the packet, plus a cry baby expression on the other side. In my case, the latter face is positioned a little too low, so that the bottom of it is visible below the hairpiece.</p>

<p>Might have helped if it had an accessory of some kind, but it was a free figure.</p>
