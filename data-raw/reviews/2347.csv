I once told a story where the killer whale snuck up on Cam and Flex and knocked them into the oacen and they started a fight.but Flex knocked the zombie off the whale and it was back to normal! Over all a deffinite 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I use them for the arctic version of the alphateam. The depth Charge torpedo is cool. If you put this thing underwater the propellers will spin. Averall:10/50.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-28T19:59:49.843Z","not too great","the only thing i realy enjoy about this set is the arms, i think theyre realy cool, the peices that slide over the technic peices are nice. the head os ok but not that cool. i like the propelers, and the fins are good. i dont like the tail, it looks quite blocky. 
the drones are not cool and i dont like them. its not a great set i wouldnt advise getting it. (also the tounge is cool) bye",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The minifig is pretty cool and his laser spear is awesome. The claws on the whale thing were very neat and make him look scary and intimidating to the good guys! Awesome set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BobaFett2","2011-01-19T11:27:13.047Z","It's a dinosaur!","<p>The set harkens ""back"" to the Dinosaurs sets of 2001-in fact, it's basically a Kronosaurus with mechanical arms and attachments!<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The awesome border has the Alpha Team logo and an evil Skeleton Drone on it. In the center is the set, making waves and showing it's depth. Very nicely presented.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>You only get 57. However, there are a few highlights here. Obviously there's the ""whale"", which is a very nice little piece and fits into the Dinosaurs theme as well. Then there's a trans neon green spear-very nice piece. You get two propeller hubs and TECHNIC tubing as well. Lastly, you get two trans neon green crystals for the eyes.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>The Skeleton Drone looks quite nice. The suit doesn't look like it was made for water-it's the same as it was in 2001-but it's nonetheless a very nice torso. The helmet is one of the oddest ever, and very nice.<br>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's simple-but there's more than there appears. The arms, tail, and ""harpoon"", are all built. But it's not particularly complex.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>I don't like the arms-they're very thin. They do look mechanical, as they are supposed to, but they aren't amazing either. The tail is also odd. The propellers and harpoon are great, although simple.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>If you can get this for less than 10 dollars, I'd recommend buying it. It makes for a great addition to your Alpha Team collection, as well as a nice gift for someone young-the easy build and great minifigure are all very nice for those with little building experience, and the parts are easy to use.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-26T12:34:47.777Z","Killer Whale, Killer Scale","<p>Set #4797 Ogel Mutant Killer Whale: The only thing bad I have to say about this set is the fact that it doesn't have the right coloring to be a Killer Whale, its basically all black when I think it would look cooler if it actually had a mixture of white in there like on a real killer whale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>True this is intended to represent a <strong>Mutant Killer Whale</strong>, but still if you started with a base Killer Whale specimen and mutated it shouldn't it still have some of the white markings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is still killer, whoops bad pun, the thing is built using the same pieces as the LEGO Dinosaurs Mosasaurus (I think) and it is pretty nifty as far as building something out of LEGO goes. I like unique builds and this is one of the uniquest sets that I own as far as construction goes. It's simple to build too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure included I really dig, even when I had plans to get rid of all Alpha Team sets from my collection I was really wanting to hold onto this one for the Mini-Figure alone. It's a basic black and red Ogel Minion body with a skull head on top. And the skull is suitably evil looking much different from the skeletons in the classic Castle and Pirates sets of the late 80's early 90's.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also looks good next to the new Atlantis theme sets, a large bulky looking mechanical like whale built out of unique pieces, terrorizing the Atlantis Expedition and devouring up the Atlantis keys. There's a lot of good potential with this set so if you're looking to expand your underwater theme, this one is a definite good choice.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-28T13:38:36.57Z","LEGO Alpha Team - Ogel Mutant Killer Whale Review","The Ogel mutant killer whale was a very quick built and it also includes some pieces which I've seen in the LEGO Dinosaurs theme. We get a basic skeleton soldier who appears a lot in the LEGO Alpha Team - Mission Deep Sea theme. You won't have to complain about stickers but the whole set looks very awsome.<br><br>On the top of the whale is a cool harpoon gun and the arms of this whale look cool as well. The eyes of that creature are made out of a gem piece. It's a good set but it's not my favourite LEGO Alpha Team set I've got...<br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
