"Blade","2007-09-05T03:02:24.973Z","Cut Down to Size.","This set is from a series I was never really able to collect much of. Which I feel is a shame as it seems like a nice underwater series. This model is a kind of Aqua scooter. It has a big spinning circular blade attached to a hinging arm. It also has handles for the mini-fig and a rotor at the back. Model is well designed for cutting through things.

The mini-fig is Ogle, who is all black with shoulder guards and a gold visor for his helmet. He also has a red fluoro hook for a hand and a red bionic eye by the looks of it.This is also one of those sets that comes with a small two page comic at the back of the instruction book. 

The only real let down with this little model is he cant hold onto both the handles of the model at the same time but dose he really need to as his other hand is a hook.

Overall this model is pretty straight forward. Looks intriguing but has very little playability. I feel this model is a 5/10 and is great if you have its other two companions or the rest of the series. Also good for any under water fan.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Outcast","2008-06-29T17:14:16.153Z","Great little set!","This is a good set for its size!

Pros:

-Easy way to get Ogel
-Only set with saw in trans red
-Good parts

Cons:

-Could have included a piece of seaweed, or an orb etc.

All in all this a good set for cheap! :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pepper","2009-06-02T13:01:27.717Z","nothing special","I got this set a few years ago for my b-day. It is an OK set, nothing special, but a good, easy way to get Ogel.<br/><br/>pros:<br/>-Ogel<br/>-the saw is cool, and it spins<br/>-could be used for Rock Raiders or Power Miners<br/><br/>cons:<br/>-none really, except kind of boring on it's own<br/><br/>Overall, this set is pretty much good only if you have other Alpha Team sets. I don't particularly reccommend it, but if you have Ogel's Base, you might want to get it.",TRUE,2,2,2,2,3
