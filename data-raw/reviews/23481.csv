Released in 2014 to coincide with the release of The Lego Movie it was made by the company ClicTime.</p>

<p><b>Features</b></p>

<p>This clocks features are normal for a clock with its display showing either a 24 hour or 12 hour clock, also it shows a time for when it&rsquo;s alarm goes off. On the back there are multiple buttons for setting the time and alarm, and one for hour and another for minutes to set an alarm of the time you need to hold down either the Time Set or Alarm Set button and press the hour button to set it to the right hour then the minutes button to set it to the right minute then let go of the Time or Alarm Set buttons.</p>

<p>Also at the back there is a On or Off switch for the alarm and a plate been held down by a screw that contains 2 AAA Batteries i believe. And one more feature is if you press down Emmets head the front display will light up Blue.</p>

<p><b>Looks and Playability</b></p>

<p>The design of the clock is made to represent Emmet in his high vis uniform with his name tag, showing his face with a smile and no hard hat on.</p>

<p>Some of the i guess you can call play features are the fact his arms and legs can move like a normal minifigure&nbsp;can.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To finish off my first review of a clock i will recommend this to a parent wanting to decorate their child&rsquo;s rooms but overall this is something that can be passed on. I will also say i wished it had a minifigure&nbsp;like the old watches did.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -&nbsp;</strong>Got a decent price for what it is and functions very well</p>

<p><strong>Cons -&nbsp;</strong>Lack of potential play features, Could have come with a minifigure&nbsp;like the old watches did.</p>
