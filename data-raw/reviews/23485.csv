Not sure what it is that makes it so abysmal but it truly is! &nbsp;It just feels like it was rushed and is purely a money making add on for the movie! &nbsp; I even feel the graphics are poor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>There might be the 15 levels but unlike LOTRs,&nbsp;Batman&nbsp;2, Marvel, Pirates of the Caribbean, the Harry Potters, there is nothing really extra to do out of the levels. &nbsp;Even the extra trophies&nbsp;you achieve on PS3 Xbox are pretty simple. &nbsp;Really disappointing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope&nbsp;that Tt will be back on form with the hobbit game out in a few weeks. And that it even beats Lego city undercover for the wii u!</p>

The game has some problems, but overall I found it to be very enjoyable if a bit bland due to certain issues with execution.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>This is a direct tie-in based game. It follows the same formula of the other LEGO Video Games with the unfortunate problem of being rushed to reach a deadline. This is obvious in how the hub world is handled, with each area of the movie a separate world that isn&rsquo;t interconnected. Hub Worlds that are more interconnected often feel much better executed than the disjointed hub worlds that are separated for whatever reason. Perhaps it is a limitation of the hardware.</p>

<p>The title has a large selection of levels, though not much else going for it. There are few quests to deal with, not as many side-events and a very limited number of collectibles and characters to play. In fact some of the characters from the movie are absent, which is unfortunate, though understandable due to licensing issues.</p>

<p><strong>Game Play</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to the game play there aren&rsquo;t as many issues here as past titles. I can&rsquo;t recall any game breaking glitches that forced me to reset the system. The cut scenes are taken directly from the movie, which is a bit jarring because the level of detail in the animation changes when you&rsquo;re playing the game.</p>

<p>I recall a few puzzles in some stages being quite frustrating at times, while others were so simple that it detracted slightly from the experience. The world is still quite vast and despite needing to hob between sections of the universe it is very enjoyable to see many characters walking around.</p>

<p>I feel though that this title was just too rushed. There are instances of story pacing that just do not work as well for a game as they would for a movie, and some of the voice acting seems to be a sound-a-like, at least where Will Ferrel is concerned. Ultimately the game is a rushed product.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Being that this product was rushed to make a deadline it seems very bland. The music in point is extremely repetitive and irritating during the hub worlds. There are some pacing issues and the characters are a bit lacking in abilities, with too many similar characters and not enough variety or excitement compared to other titles from this company.</p>

<p>With something like The LEGO Movie I honestly feel that the standard formula from TT is an inappropriate fit. The game plays it too safe, there isn&rsquo;t enough imagination here and while I can see that they were trying when they introduced the Build Manuals feature which was a very enjoyable new feature that has remained ever since. I can&rsquo;t really recommend this to casual gamers, only hard core fans might seem some value in owning everything from TT. The Marvel and DC Super Hero games would be a better fit for folks looking for more excitement and more to do, even the DLC for this game was very lacking and quite limited without any new levels or anything aside from a few more characters.</p>
