The set consists of 18 pieces and is basically an Ogel drone, sitting on top of an octopus, that has a small harpoon dock mounted under it.

The octopus is a basic black octopus but to do something a little different they have given you two pieces to make his eyes neon yellow, which is different.

The Ogel drone is quite a cool looking character and if you like him this set is a cheep way to get him. He is dressed in pants and a shirt that have one side red and one side black. He has a grey oxygen tank and a full, neon yellow mask. His face is a skeleton head.

The dock is very simplistic too. Really it is just a board with two neon yellow harpoons on it that hinge 180 degrees.

Overall the set is very basic but has a few good pieces. I'm sure it was quite cheep so a good one for keeping the children happy. I feel this set is a 5/10 or Average as it has no real con's but has no real pro's either. This set isn't a necessity for your collection but pick it up if its cheap enough or build it yourself from existing pieces you have.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
