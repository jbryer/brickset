"Pariah_","2019-05-20T17:16:51.483Z","interesting set","<p>I don&#39;t know how I ended up with this one, but I did. I pulled it out from my big box of bricks and played with it a little.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>It has three parts, a wheel base, middle part and top part. It has a lot of stickers and the parts are really specialized that they can&#39;t be used for much else. I guess if you get this new, the stickers would work for custom speed champions cars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>Its only Ok. You can rearrange the parts a little but that&#39;s practically it.</p>

<h2>Value for money</h2>

<p>on Ebay, this set ranges from 15 cents to 100 dollars (USD). The average price is probably around 10-15 dollars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall rating</h2>

<p>its an average happy meal toy, not as bad as the Galidor ones but still quite interesting as of how it was styled.</p>
