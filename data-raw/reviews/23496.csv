So a minifigure pack it is!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A&nbsp;blister pack with&nbsp;a hilly landscape with&nbsp;castle as background,&nbsp;I don&#39;t think I even got the chance to take a good look at it before it was torn to shreds though. Instructions are not included but since this is just a minifigure pack they aren&#39;t needed anyway. I liked the small box minifigure packs used to come in better and no, that&#39;s not just nostalgia: I don&#39;t like plastic packaging in general.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Metallic armour? Check. Metallic helmets? Check - wait, what&#39;s up with that visor? Yes, back in the eighties weapons&nbsp;and armour&nbsp;only&nbsp;came in a standard, non-metallic&nbsp;colour (either black, brown or grey) but since they were all like that it did not bother at all. That&nbsp;light bley visor on a metallic helmet really stands out like a sore tooth though, as does the bley axe next to the metallic sword and spear. And I just checked, both these parts are also (or at least were)&nbsp;available in a metallic&nbsp;or pearl grey&nbsp;colour so that couldn&#39;t have been too hard to change? I&nbsp;might even&nbsp;have&nbsp;preferred a black visor&nbsp;to this light bley one...</p>

<p>A nice touch are those chrome gold coins reminiscent of the coins found in old pirate sets but with smaller denominations, the modern gold ingot feels slightly anachronistic though maybe those are older than you think? Again, I liked the plumes from my childhood better than this one, not because they were nicer but because they came on a wheel of three (three different plume sizes of the same colour)&nbsp;while here you receive just one.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Well, these are a giant leap forward compared to those from my childhood: crisp, multicoloured printing on front and back, one of them even has some armour printed on his legs. They are similarly equipped as their counterparts in #850889 Dragon Knights but seem to have received the better end of the deal with that bowman, and I like the treasure a lot more than I would have liked that&nbsp;tiny catapult #850889 comes with. The armoured knight has a double face; a&nbsp;determined one&nbsp;and&nbsp;a scared one with the latter being&nbsp;the children&#39;s favourite. Every once in a while when they&#39;re not looking, I turn the head back around to the determined face but&nbsp;next time I take a look at&nbsp;the knight he&#39;s&nbsp;again reduced&nbsp;to being a scaredy pants.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a minifigure pack, and they even come completely assembled so no build at all. Then again, if you want something to build you get something else.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Old minifigure packs (eighties again) used to have a mix of all available factions instead of including figures from just one. This can work both ways, the previous system allowed you to buy one box and get figures in opposing factions reinforcing&nbsp;them all&nbsp;at once, ready to do battle.&nbsp;With the new system you can select exactly which faction you want or need reinforced, but if you still want an even distribution you&#39;ll need to buy more than one set and they&#39;re hardly cheap as it is. That is actually my biggest problem with this, you used to receive six figures (or e.g.&nbsp;five and a treasure chest) but this set only includes four and a treasure chest at a much higher price. Granted, production is better so most likely more expensive too but maybe, just maybe, my kids would have liked more if slightly less detailed knights&nbsp;(remember that equation in the introduction)?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I seem to prefer the old way of having a mix of different factions in one box, as now we have a rather underdeveloped Dragon Knights faction to take on the reinforced Lion Knights, but this way does allow a bit more variation in each army. In the end you can argue all day about producing battle packs with just one faction or more factions, but for the price I feel it could have included at least something more.</p>
