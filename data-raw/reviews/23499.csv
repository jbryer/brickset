<p>I found a listing for this figure on eBay. It was lumped in with The Lego Movie: Everything Is Awesome Edition Blu-ray, for $11.39. I&rsquo;d say it was a real steal. Let&rsquo;s get into my review, shall we?</p>

<p><b>Instructions:</b></p>

<p>This set comes with one piece of paper, telling you how to put together the figure. It also shows the display stand in action (more on that later). The tag line at the bottom reads &ldquo;ASSEMBLING IN 2014&rdquo;. Not very sophisticated, but the printing on the paper is exclusive, if that&rsquo;s your thing (it&rsquo;s mine).</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>

<p>This set only comes with five pieces. It takes 10 seconds to put together. Still, they are Lego bricks, so that counts for something.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>This promo comes with 5 parts: Emmet&rsquo;s hard hat/hair combo, his torso, legs, head, and an exclusive printed minifigure stand. The print on the stand is The Lego Movie logo, and the printing is very high quality for something that was free. This piece is the main draw of the set, and I wish that it was used for the CMF series. This piece&nbsp;exclusivity raises the price drastically when buying second-hand. Other than&nbsp;that, this set is not very &ldquo;Special.&rdquo; Pun intended.&nbsp;The head printing on the figure is the same print that can only be&nbsp;found in TLM CMF series, which is a nice bonus. The only downside&nbsp;is that it&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t include the 1x2 instructions tile that the CMF figure does.&nbsp;One side of his head is an open-mouthed grin,&nbsp;and the other is an open-mouthed, eyes closed print (think of someone laughing).</p>

<p><b>Playability:</b></p>

<p>This promo can provide hours of fun. It&rsquo;s a minifigure and can be used with other bricks that you own. It can also be displayed on the stand, which is it&rsquo;s best use.</p>

<p><b>Value For Money:</b></p>

<p>I&nbsp;would&nbsp;definitely not recommend purchasing this on eBay. It&rsquo;s too expensive, and not really worth the money when you&rsquo;re buying it for the stand. I would definitely recommend snapping this figure up if you ever find a dirt cheap listing like I did.</p>

<p><b>Overall Rating:</b></p>

<p>This set is definitely worth buying if you find it cheap. The figure is nice to have if you didn&rsquo;t get a chance to buy it in the CMF series, and the stand&rsquo;s printing is really useful and nice to have. Overall, I rate this set 5 Octan Propagandas out of 5 Octan Propagandas.</p>
