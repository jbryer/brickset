<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a really nice &quot;Architecture&quot; format with the unfolding front (the same format as BTTF) and it is much sturdier than a normal Lego System box. The yellow and black stripes on the side are also a nice touch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The instructions are quite nice and have a square binding unlike normal System sets that have the magazine-like books. The instructions are pretty easy to follow even though there are no numbered bags and it even shows which initials on the torsos go with which minifig for anybody unfamiliar with the names of the Ghostbusters. Both the front and the back of the book are filled with fun facts about the set and the Ghostbusters movie, plus some character quotes throughout the build.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are amazing in this set! You receive 8 dark red studs with the hole (9 counting the extra), 4 black whips, a light blue-ish grey CMF stand, a blue pneumatic hose, many never before seen metallic sprayed pieces and many new prints, no stickers with this one!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs in this set are outstanding! You get all 4 of the Ghostbusters with their back packs and accessories. The back packs do have a printed inverted round tile which adds great detail that honestly, we could have lived without but Lego still added it in there! All of the torsos are different because of name tags and even wrinkles and how much the shirts are buttoned up; the backs include the Ghostbusters logo and the Ghostbuster&#39;s first name. All of the heads are also different and exclusive, they all include scared faces when you turn them around for when they encounter a scary ghost!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty straight forward even though there are no numbered bags (the only downside to the build) and no stickers means that there is no hassle with peeling and unaligned stickers. the build itself contains pretty cool building tricks and uses odd ways to build things throughout. The only kind of &quot;hard part&quot; is when you are putting the small multi-side bar pieces into the pneumatic hose but they slide in nicely after you break through the first quarter millimeter.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The car itself is pretty amazing. It seems like it is made mostly as a display item because it has next to no play features, but it does role nicely and is pretty sturdy. Unfortunately only three of the busters can fit in the car and only one backpack in the back, but you do get a stand for the figures so my point about display comes back into play there. Even though the sensors etc. on the roof that are very detailed look fragile it&#39;s actually pretty well put together aside from a couple of things. The car as a whole just looks great with the smooth plating and that vintage car look.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall the set is a great buy and I don&#39;t think there is much more to be said!</p>

"tkettle9719","2014-06-26T05:13:01.293Z","LEGO Ideas 21108: Ghostbusters Ecto-1 REVIEW","<p>In the thirty years since it was made, the original Ghostbusters film has spawned two generations of love for one of the greatest comedy films ever. The genius ideas that came from Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd&#39;s script proved a remarkable success on-screen. It comes as no surprise, then, that fans of the horror comedy would find new ways to celebrate one of the greatest films of all time. And that&#39;s exactly what Brent Waller would do. His prototype was already beautiful and instantly recognizable as the Ecto-1, a modified 1959 Cadillac ambulance. But here, for the sixth Lego Ideas set, Lego has finally hit the mark with a perfect product of the Cuusoo/Ideas line, better than the DeLorean (which &nbsp;I liked, but it did have its faults), Minecraft (a mediocre representation of a wonderful game), and the Curiosity Rover (which I never had the opportunity to purchase:( )</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The minifigures are gorgeous here (aren&#39;t they all, nowadays?). Every Ghostbuster&nbsp;is instantly recognizable; Egon&#39;s&nbsp;glasses, Ray&#39;s cheeriness, Peter&#39;s calm, and Winston&#39;s mustache; all beautifully realized. In case you needed to identify them, every torso is detailed with the nametags of each Ghostbuster in order to identify them.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>This set is chock-full of detail; with the torsos of each Ghostbuster printed on front and back, the accessories such as the ghost catcher and the proton packs, the hose and the ladder, the entire roof area (it&#39;s perfectly realized with every single detail realized); it&#39;s not hard to tell that this is the Ecto-1 from Ghostbusters.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>There are absolutely NO stickers in this build. NONE! ZERO! ZIP! And really, other than the Ghostbusters logo and the license plate, there really didn&#39;t need to be any. Thankfully, though, those parts are fully printed on to the bricks, making them, in my opinion, a little cooler and WAY more desirable. Collectable, too, I suppose.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Very interesting building structures; although most of the build isn&#39;t necessarily groundbreaking, there are two features which I find... fantastic! The first is the side windows, which are oddly constructed right into the car rather than directly on the sides (well utilized space, too, but it looks a bit awkward inside), and the wheel structure, which is attached by means of a brown cross axle extension, is also a bit unexpected. A creative build, to say the least.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Cons</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>All of these cons are nit-picky, as they always are with Lego. The most egregious error on display, though, has to be that all four of the Ghostbusters cannot fit inside the car at once (at least, not while sitting). While all four can theoretically fit inside simultaneously, one of the guys has to be in the ambulatory (double entendre caught, hopefully) position, which just feels a bit odd.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Although I have not personally experienced this issue, many cases have been reported of the collectable instruction booklets falling apart, with photo evidence to prove it. This is not something I would expect of a specialty set, especially in the limited Cuusoo/Ideas range. Also, many of the instructions are not well-printed; I confused a few of the stud piece colors, which made me go into a panic attack.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Finally, I think that it&#39;s worth noting that the minifig collection could be a little more expansive; I, for one, would gladly pay a little more for Louis, Dana, Janine, and maybe even Slimer to join this set. As it is, there is plenty of playability here; yet, I can&#39;t help but feel it could be that little bit cooler.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>With that said, then, I think that wraps up this review. This is a wonderful set to display; it&#39;s minifig-scaled, filled with detail, and it looks distinct. This Ecto-1 was well thought-out and excellently realized, even more so than the DeLorean. And, while the model was really finalized by the actions of Lego employees, I can&#39;t help but thank Brent Waller for making this set a reality. The release of (possibly) the only Lego Ghostbusters set was incredibly well-timed, and it also helped to show just how important this movie is to people. He helped to unite people for one cause, and that takes some skill. Hopefully, Lego will release a short wave of sets with the other characters of the series, but for now, let&#39;s just marvel at the fact that Lego made a Ghostbusters set! No one could have imagined this a few years ago, but sometimes, dreams do come true. Let&#39;s just be thankful that Lego didn&#39;t decide that &quot;No job was too big. No fee is too big.&quot;</p>

"Sethro3","2014-09-15T18:14:12.367Z","I called. They answered!","<p>I loved this movie as a kid. I never imagined LEGO would be able to release something like this. As an adult I don&#39;t love the movie as much, but the set brings back so many of those nostalgic feelings, it makes up for it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The IDEAS boxes are wonderful. They really give you value for your money. Be careful when opening it so it doesn&#39;t rip out the tab though.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of useful pieces for MOCs. The end result shows what you can really do with LEGO. I like the new 1x1 dark red round plate with hole.&nbsp; Very useful! And the silver metallic color is useful.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figures don&#39;t really look like the actual cast, but I always welcome new minifigure prints and hair in new colors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very clever build techniques. Especially the window angle. The rear fins work really well at this scale. SNOT building at its finest.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would highly recommend this set. I don&#39;t know how well the play value is considering it just sits on a shelf, but some of the details look like they might fall off easily.</p>

<p>Display piece = YES</p>

<p>Light play = YES</p>

<p>Rough play = I&#39;d rethink it.</p>

"zipsforbananas","2014-07-06T14:59:38.473Z","""Generally, you don't see that kind of excellence in a major Cuusoo set...""","<p>After a very mixed reception to the Delorean, this set, the first of the&nbsp;Cuusoo set to be released under the new Ideas branding (though still regarded as set #006 in the series) is an absolute triumph. The feeling of Cuusoo was somewhat muted, subjects that weren&#39;t so universally appealing, or popular culture that wasn&#39;t realised all that well. I can see why this set was released under the new brand (though it got all the way to production under the old label), it sets off Lego Ideas with quite some oomph!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>From the moment you pick this set up in its box you know you&#39;re holding something special. The flap design where you only have to snip two sticker seals to be able to get in, and that you know this box will survive the experience make the whole set feel special. The hazard tape printing on the edges are a nice touch, and I haven&#39;t even mentioned how good the cover picture is yet! The back of the box has an alternate view and a couple of shots in film strip down the side; in all you get to see just about everything the car has to offer, and you get a good view of the figures, though not with their display stand.<br />
I did quite like having just the five bags sorted&nbsp;according to part size (roughly speaking!) rather than numbered bags. For a build this size it was no drawback at all and I think adds to the overall feeling of coherence, that this is a special and self-contained set.</p>

<p>The instructions are in a lovely booklet as the presentation so far would lead you to expect. It&#39;s bound and has the cover photo and hazard tape pattern along the bottom. It starts with a few pages on the Ghostbusters film and on the Ecto-1 vehicle, and at the end before the part list there&#39;s a double page on the designers, Cuusoo and Lego, and a page on Ideas after the part list. The instructions themselves are good, clear, and well paced.<br />
The presentation is spiced up with a black background throughout, adding to that quality feel, and there are quotes from the film sporadically throughout, though more frequently at the start it has to be said.</p>

<p>And one thing conspicuously absent is a sticker sheet. Whoop! All the pieces are printed! You get four 2x2 white curves with the Ghostbusters logo printed on, four black boat studs with printing <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">(a new technique this year?)&nbsp;</span>for the proton packs, and two presumably Chima-lion-yellow&nbsp;1x2 tiles with the license&nbsp;plate number on. All very nice to have, especially given how TLG so often seems to avoid printing.<br />
Oh, there&#39;s a 2x2 sloped brick with a computer screen on too, but that&#39;s a very old piece.<br />
And that&#39;s a nice segue into the next section...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Though just about&nbsp;every part of this set is good and strong I&#39;m tempted to say this is where it is strongest.<br />
There are a plethora of SNOT pieces, including many I regard as rare because they&#39;re still fairly new - 12 of the light grey&nbsp;1x2 angular plate (bracket) with 2x2 studs coming upwards and 13 of them in white with just the 1x2 studs on the side, and a load more besides.<br />
The chromed pieces are great too, lots of grilles, 1x1 cheese wedge slopes, and most excitingly four<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;1x1 round bricks and&nbsp;</span>two&nbsp;1x2 sloped grille &quot;roof tile&quot; pieces.<br />
The 1x1 dark red round plates with a hole in the middle will be of interest to many an MOCer I&#39;m sure, as will all the white slopes, and I always like having trans window panels of any kind.</p>

<p>You can see most of the interesting parts just looking at the vehicle, but the moments in building it that drive home just how many there are are the places where you&#39;re creating 12 stud long walls of studs on the side from brackets, and a few steps later you add another row on top!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>These are of course fantastic, each character having his own initials printed on his torso too, and with great head printing and good choices of hairpiece to represent each one. They all have terrified faces on the reverse too, which should add to the playability if they&#39;re snagging ghosts (the glow in the dark sandwich board ones from old castle sets?).</p>

<p>What makes them really special is their proton packs, made very cleverly with clips where you might expect a plain plate, adding not just greebles&nbsp;but also the way the packs are attached to the minifigures. The printed boat stud pieces&nbsp;are very nice, as are the dark red round 1x1 plates with a hole, and the whips used as the pipe/cable/whatever-it-is-that-carries-and-conducts-a-proton-stream.</p>

<p>And because they are so special they get their own stand, complete with the hazard tape theme, and a very cleverly attached logo on the front. (I inwardly went &quot;wow!&quot; when I realised how the 2 wide short slope was attached in two places - a theme to be repeated later.)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I can&#39;t say there were a great deal of clever techniques in the main build (beyond the very clever side windows), but the entire vehicle has plates mounted vertically on all four sides which keeps it constantly interesting.<br />
The back end is the least interesting of the 4 with just the one 1x4 brick with 4 studs along one side providing the side-mounted studs.<br />
The front has a nice mix of brackets projecting studs from the bottom on each end, and a bracket dropping studs downwards in the middle, so that when the front module is attached it creates a kind of clamp around the front end. Since the brackets that have the studs going upwards have come into sets I&#39;ve always been pleased to see them used this way, adding something to the&nbsp;structure of the set instead of just being cosmetic.<br />
And the sides continue&nbsp;that theme, with what seems to me an opulent number of brackets attached to the underside of the central area, and the same number of shorter brackets added above them, creating that same kind of clamp. The sides are especially nice as they demonstrate very clearly the ratios needed to line up studs vertically relative to the heights of the bricks, and over the back wheels the depth of the bracket is used, demonstrating how one stud plus the depth of the bracket is the same as the height of one brick. Lots of little things that will teach some builders how to use SNOT brackets better, and all together achieve a&nbsp;very compact and coherent feel within this&nbsp;model.<br />
It almost feels more like a miniature model or action figure vehicle than a Lego model, in no small part because of this!</p>

<p>The construction of the sides of the vehicle is worth mentioning in its own right too, with the nice combination&nbsp;of short wing plates and more brackets mounted on the side for the rear bumper and brake lights. The newish 1x2 short curve pieces, and the double width 2x2 pieces are a big part of how the side section goes together. The way the symmetrical 2x2/2x4 wing plates are used to create the wheel arches&nbsp;and the sloped sides you don&#39;t need are covered is nice. The whole section is a real joy to put together as you feel every part you place adds something significant to the structure, or adds a very nice finishing touch as the car begins to come together.</p>

<p>The side windows are terrific too, almost a part of what I&#39;ve been highlighting already with them resting on cheese wedge pieces to get the angle, and held in place&nbsp;cleverly with clips that are themselves cleverly mounted around where the seats would be.</p>

<p>The final part of the model (predictably!) is the roof, and building up the greebles on top is fun! It&#39;s got lots of little pieces all round giving a wonderfully geeky and homemade feel, just like it should have. And the colours, trans blue lights, red and white too, bright green and yellow containers, all make it look great. and the way the blue hose from the side of&nbsp;the car&nbsp;tucks in and the ladder comes down over the side integrate it well so it doesn&#39;t really look like it just lifts off easily.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As I said earlier the finished car looks far more like a model made from a kit or an action figure&#39;s vehicle than a Lego model, it&#39;s just superb with all its contours and details. I suppose a lot of the pieces are small, but it&#39;s also surprisingly small for a 500+ piece model, testament to how cleverly and compactly it&#39;s constructed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t imagine playability is all that high as there aren&#39;t really any features to the car, but there&#39;s&nbsp;plenty going on details-wise, and the inside is spacious enough to fit a couple of figures with their packs stored in the back, three if you squeeze them in with no regard for personal space. But then most of the action should happen around the figures not the car anyway, right?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a really fantastic set! The presentation is fantastic, from the moment you open thee box and pull out the instruction manual&nbsp;it feels high quality, building the display stand for the figures first means you&#39;ve got that display feel going throughout, and when you put the roof on the car you instantly think how great it will look displayed, possibly in front of the box!<br />
It&#39;s a great homage to Ghostbusters, works well as a collector&#39;s item, but all the while it remains a great Lego set.<br />
I&#39;ll admit that the price did seem a little steep to me, I was wandering the Lego store for quite a while&nbsp;before I decided to buy it, but having built it I can confidently say it&#39;s worth every penny, it actually seems quite good value!</p>

<p>I&#39;m so, so glad I bought it, if you&#39;re reading this unsure and still aren&#39;t sure now you&#39;ve read it, I think my final words should be - buy it, you won&#39;t regret it!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Amazingly, I was expecting the book to fall apart as others reported.&nbsp; It did not, thankfully.&nbsp; The book IS massive!&nbsp; I found it far easier to hold it and build one handed.&nbsp; The black background of the pages was a bit hard on the eyes at times, but no bother.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen bigger kits that had 2 and 3 books that were easier to deal with.&nbsp; This is a rare case I really do wish they don&#39;t do again.&nbsp; Its also a challenge to tell silver bricks from trans-clear at times.&nbsp; Again, this is a build and learn thing like any.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box, on the other hand... the bags were very poorly designed.&nbsp; Several bags, not numbered as so many modern kits, it seamed the bricks were random more then they should.&nbsp; This required far more work space then I could comfortably use or reach and I&#39;m far from the child of years ago.&nbsp; Dealing with everything in a gigantic mass greatly slowed the start of the build.&nbsp; I would sure recommend anyone prepare a bigger workspace and sure separate colors, even if you have to use dinner plates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This was an amazing design that lived up to every expectation as the Brickset previews and reviews showed.&nbsp; This is due to the designers really thinking &quot;sideways&quot; with common bricks.&nbsp; As far as I know, there are no unique bricks to this very unique kit thats quality&nbsp;sure doesn&#39;t happen very often.&nbsp; What disappointed me most was the lack of a P.K.E. Meter that was a key prop of the Ghostbusters Universe.&nbsp; If anything that should have been specially designed?&nbsp; Come on.&nbsp; I did love, however, the lack of stickers!&nbsp; The few bricks that host logos are painted as the minifigs are.&nbsp; That gets 5 stars alone.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs are very fair for the actors... less Vankman&#39;s hair.&nbsp; Bill Murry could only dream of the locks he got from Legoland.&nbsp; Revisiting the fact Lego made no&nbsp;custom molded bricks for this amazing kit, if one thing that should have been made unique... should have been a thinning hairline.&nbsp; Its a big kit to have no customs.&nbsp; I do love the 2-faces each has, allowing options in display or play, depending.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been building more kits then I care to admit this&nbsp;past years, as my love for Lego re-grows.&nbsp; I strongly believe the build was slowed due to the issue of poor&nbsp;inventory design as I mentioned and a hard to manage book.&nbsp; Sure, a younger builder may need&nbsp;help and&nbsp;sharing a build&nbsp;between parent and child is never a bad thing.&nbsp; I still feel I&#39;ve built far lager kits in far less time on average.&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, after the rough start was behind me the kayos quickly faded and the beautiful build took shape as it always seams to do.&nbsp; I&#39;m also lucky to have a spectator who thinks Lego designs are pure magic so I get to stop every couple steps and show the kit off, knowing I&#39;m doing well along the way.&nbsp; I don&#39;t really see any room for improvement or addition I would wish to ad as they did such a good job on this kit.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What always impresses me most about movie-based Lego kits is when they come so very close to reality... or movie reality.&nbsp; This happens almost never in buildings, more commonly in vehicles when possible.&nbsp; The only complaint you could ever possibly have is the odd bit falling off in handling... but you would be a&nbsp;newbie in the world of Lego to not expect that.&nbsp; If repairs are just snapping something back on?&nbsp; What&#39;s the issue?&nbsp; This model would look wonderful as a prize on a shelf with your mixed collection or on its own or in a shadow-box.&nbsp; Well worth the time, money and effort.&nbsp; My only regret is the lights don&#39;t really work and that&#39;s a whole differnt page of adventure I&#39;m not willing to explore for spoiling this peice of art.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you love Lego... and you clearly do or you wouldn&#39;t be on this site... and you love this classic 80&#39;s movie... I don&#39;t know how you couldn&#39;t buy this kit!&nbsp; For me, I think it may be a rare mixture of loves where I would buy a kit like this.&nbsp; Classic cars?&nbsp; Classic adventures?&nbsp; Classic movies?&nbsp; The only way it would be better is if I had no clue this kit existed and someone was thoughtful enough to get it for my birthday and surprise me.&nbsp; hehe.&nbsp; Sometimes you have to do those things for yourself... however the ultimate&nbsp;thanks is due to the designers.&nbsp; Lets hope this magic&nbsp;comes again... someplace else.</p>

"sudorum","2014-12-28T04:22:41.45Z","I Ain't Afraid of No Ghost","<p>What a neat set. In my opinion, it&#39;s the best set to come out from the Cuusoo&nbsp;Ideas line. When you&#39;re going up against the Ghostbusters though, the competition&#39;s gonna be tough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both the box and the instruction booklet have a distinctly retro feel. Unlike the typically large,&nbsp;thin&nbsp;instruction books that&nbsp;recent Lego&nbsp;sets come with,&nbsp;the Ghostbusters book is small and compact. Due to this, the pages don&#39;t lie flat on their own. Only the application of constant pressure keeps the pages from flipping back to the front of the book. This problem&nbsp;complicated the construction&nbsp;process a bit, but not enough to cause extreme frustration. The build is simply too interesting to be hampered by a flaw in the instruction book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was surprised to find out that the Ghostbuster&nbsp;uniform&nbsp;isn&#39;t&nbsp;generic; it actually includes each character&#39;s respective&nbsp;name&nbsp;on its backside and their initials on its front. No&nbsp;complaints about the minifigures included in the set, but it&#39;s regrettable&nbsp;that Lego didn&#39;t include Slimer.&nbsp;Nevertheless, Rotta the hut from the Clone Wars sets makes for a suitable stand in.</p>

<p>The Lego Ecto-1&nbsp;shares a striking resemblance with its film counterpart.&nbsp;Even the little details, like the Ecto-1 license plate,&nbsp;have been accounted for.&nbsp;The interior includes a steering wheel and&nbsp;a computer that is possibly some kind of ghost tracking device. Unfortunately, only three of the Ghostbusters can fit in the vehicle. And that&#39;s only if all of their packs have been removed. I absolutely think&nbsp;the model could be improved if its size was expanded. A UCS type set, for example,&nbsp;would be more accurate and also more impressive on display. I&#39;m actually curious as to why the Ecto-1 isn&#39;t&nbsp;more of a display set, because the minifigures come with a display stand of their own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since this set is from Cuusoo, it&#39;s unlikely that Lego will make any more Ghostbusters themed sets. This is a huge disappointment, because imagine how great it would be to have minifigures&nbsp;of Zuul, Gozer, and the StayPuft&nbsp;Marshmallow Man! Ghostbusters is definitely popular enough to warrant a greater variety of sets.&nbsp;</p>

This set was the first, but it was not to be the last. Time to discuss this set in detail from packaging to performance. And I ain&rsquo;t afraid of no ghosts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The front of the box has a very impressive shot showing off the contents of the set, with a spooky green mist everywhere blocking off what I assume to be the firehouse entrance where the car typically is seen zooming out of. The back has another great shot, with the car parked facing Ray, Egon and Winston who hare shooting their proton wands while Peter stands nearby and the trap is in front of him prepared to catch something. In the background you can see a shot of New York. Each side of the box has some hazard yellow and black lines at the top, making the box look like a ghost trap. Overall a very impressive box design.</span></span></span></span></p>

This thick card stock style of manual is very well executed, the step-by-step build instructions include some fun elements from the film and there are some detailed information pages on the designer, the builder who created the Ideas set and the original film. A great looking book and stands out compared to standard LEGO instructions.</span></span></span></span></p>

These being the original interpretations of the uniforms they do not include arm printing. All four have the exact same printing for their double-sided torsos as well, the only differences are the first name on the back and the initials on the name tag on the front.</span></span></span></span></p>

His face has two printed expressions, one with a slight smirk/smile and the other showing a worried/frightened expression. The Proton Pack looks great, built out of several pieces the design captures the look of the proton pack exceptionally well, using a lightsaber hilt for the neutrona wand means you can attach light bars for simulated proton streams if you wanted. Egon also includes a standard LEGO walkie talkie, which is unfortunate, no new pieces for Ideas sets mean no unique PKE meter accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>

The choice of The Joker&rsquo;s new hair piece from 2012 for his hair is an unfortunate inaccuracy, however because of the mandate that no new pieces will be sculpted for LEGO Ideas based sets that means the existing parts are all you can expect.</span></span></span></span></p>

One terrified, the other typical Bill Murray bored/indifferent look. He includes a proton pack, of course, but nothing else.</span></span></span></span></p>

He includes a proton pack, naturally and another walkie talkie.</span></span></span></span></p>

His hair piece is the standard go to piece for Bruce Wayne and other characters, it&rsquo;s not a bad look for Winston, however it doesn&rsquo;t quite match his look in the film. Just too smoothed back for Winston.</span></span></span></span></p>

Not the best designed Ghost Trap, however it does a fairly decent job of capturing the likeness of it.</span></span></span></span></p>

The overall look of the model captures the on-screen appearance quite nicely from a purely external look, unfortunately there are some aspects of the build that render the vehicle very disappointing in certain aspects.</span></span></span></span></p>

Due to the build and choices made the characters can&rsquo;t all fit inside, you can fit only two of the Ghostbusters into the vehicle at any one time, with one in the back and one in the driver&rsquo;s seat. It&rsquo;s the only flaw in an otherwise impressive model, however it is a huge one.</span></span></span></span></p>

I strongly recommend this set to all Ghostbusters fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Mattg821","2015-01-17T15:40:36.147Z","Awesome set","<p>I am an AFOL and got this for christmas(after dropping plenty of hints to the missus).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>You definitely feel like you are getting a premium kit with the cuusoo/ideas sets and this one is especially nice because it is Ghostbusters. The book is first class too.&nbsp;Ghostbuster signs and number plates.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Printed Ghostbuster signs and number plates. No stickers(always nice).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Awesome Awesome Awesome Awesome.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You either complain about no numbered bags or you just get on with it. personally i don&#39;t like numbered bags. I like to tip it all out and go for it.old school. A pleasure to build and see&nbsp;ecto-1 come together. I have given this set 5/5 and the only complaint i could muster is the definition of colours of the 1x1 slopes and 1x1 round pieces in the instructions it isn&#39;t clear the difference between shiny silver or clear but by the end of the build there aren&#39;t any left over that would make you think you have gone wrong but this isn&#39;t even a real complaint. This set is perfect.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>ABSOLUTELY&nbsp; smashed it!!!!! After the disappointment of the back to the future Delorean ECTO-1 is superb. From a distance or close up it just looks the part.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>First class. Probably best as a shelf display piece but still playable. Thank you Lego Ideas.</p>

"MiSiU","2015-07-29T08:20:45.417Z","Blast from the past","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set is a part of the IDEAS series and as such comes with a slightly different instruction. It is thick and well printed but unfortunately my copy didn&#39;t last through the whole building process with pages ungluing and falling away. Overall a good layout (with some comments from the minifigs on some pages) with average gluing quality.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As an IDEAS model the whole idea is using the bricks available from other sets but still you&nbsp;got to&nbsp;love the fact that all specific parts are painted. No stickers. Check those lovely plates.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Awesome. Knowing the movie I had no problem distinguishing individual parts to build the characters. They even have initials on their shirts! The backpacks are big but their built is well thought and firm. Also included is a special base to place the minifigs on.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a complicated mode with lots of parts changing direction but it all helps towards stability of the completed model. I had a ton of fun building it and it took me around 1,5 hours to assemble everything.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks like a lot of fun to play. It&#39;s firm and I don&#39;t see a possibility of anything falling off while playing. The problem is that it&#39;s not scaled to fit on LEGO streets. As it&#39;s size matches the scale of minifigs it is comparable to large trucks not normal LEGO cars. Still it looks great on a shelf.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set. If I were to point to weak points those would be: poor gluing of the Instruction (like I mentioned before - mine had pages falling away during building) and the price factor (the model is relatively small and fast to build meaning the time to play with it is limited). Still it looks so good when finished that I can recommend it with clear conscience.</p>

"Deathcakes","2016-01-09T12:32:28.007Z","Excellent 'busting action with just a few ""but""-s!","<p>To be perfectly honest I&#39;m not the biggest Ghostbusters-fan. I grew up during the 90&#39;s and Ghostbusters was on TV a lot. I mean, like a lot-lot... And I really liked it and I&#39;ve got the toys and fond memories to prove it! But like I said, It wasn&#39;t my go-to favorite thing.</p>

<p>That said, I have absolutely no regrets picking this set up!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is my first IDEAS set ever and I was a bit surprised by the packaging of this set. Instead of the standard-y cardboard box you&#39;re used to shoving your thumbs into to open - You&#39;re getting a thick, double-folded, re-sealable, painted-on-the-inside cardboard box!</p>

<p>The instruction booklet is also oozing with premium-feel as you get a thick booklet with a bit more &quot;fluff&quot; content than your standard instructions. This fluff comes in the form of full page images, little quotes on the build pages and stuff like that. Oh and it&#39;s also printed on a different quality of paper that adds to the premium-experience.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Ok so the first thing I noticed when I opened the box up was&nbsp;was that the parts&nbsp;didn&#39;t come in the numbered bags. I don&#39;t really know why and while I don&#39;t really mind it I actually do prefer the numbered bags. With them you have a clearer structure in the actual work of putting the lego&nbsp;together. You know that &quot;ok, for this section there&#39;s these pieces and nothing else&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the un-numbered bags I had to open each of them up and sort them by color/size. Didn&#39;t take that long nor was it in any way off-putting but it felt as if it lacks the structure the numbered bags offer.</p>

<p>Oh and by the way - There are absolutely no stickers in this set, which for me is a relief. I&#39;m not a fan of the stickers I must say. Although I have gotten better at it, which is a skill in itself I suppose!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are really good, as you&#39;d expect! They&#39;re very detailed and as far as I can see the only thing that differs from the outfits the &#39;Busters wear in the movies is that these little guys are lacking painted boots. It&#39;s in no way a deal-breaker but I think the little black boots on them would give them a little contrast to the otherwise very beige overalls they&#39;re sporting.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I mentioned earlier&nbsp;the build is made a little more complicated than, at least what I&#39;m used to, due to the lack of numbered bags. Other than this the build itself is not very hard or time-consuming (of course apart from the manual sorting you have to do, again due to the lack of numbered bags).</p>

<p>Oh and I&#39;m not sure if it was just me being unorganized/clumsy or if this was actually my first set that was missing a piece. It was when I came to the side-windows that I noticed I didn&#39;t have one of the 2x1 bits that are supposed to represent the bars in between of the windows. Luckily I had a spare one from another set, so it was fine!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>After finishing the build I gave it an inspection and even though I don&#39;t remember the movies that well I could tell that the attention to detail here is really something extra. The metal-finish of the grill, the caddie-fins and half-covered back-wheels along with all the doodads on the roof.. The car is&nbsp;just a treat to look at and putting the figures next to/into the car makes it even better!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Apart from the lack of painted boots and numbered bags, which are my only real complaints - This is an excellent set and will most certainly be one of my favorite sets in my possession! And that&#39;s coming from someone who&#39;s not THAT into Ghostbusters. It just makes me want to go fire up the movies and have these little guys bust the last little bit of halloween decorative-ghost I forgot to put away!</p>
