"ASonic87","2014-10-07T00:09:41.77Z","Epic lair!","<p>I wanted this set as soon as I saw it, but it seemed too expensive, so I was waiting for a good deal and got this for 32$ on ebay, which is I guess quite a good price. For this price it is a steal!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box artwork is nice, I love TMNT series boxes&nbsp;(cartoon ones, not the movie)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Set includes lots of purple parts, which could be of interest. Also cool glow in the dark studs, windows, and LOTS of weapons.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I wasn&#39;t too crazy about Michelangelo or Raphael, since I already had them from other sets, but the purple Shredder is awesome! I like him better than the one from 2013, which I also own. Also the robo foot ninja is fun. Mike from this set can be useful, since he has a serious facial expression showing some teeth, while most of other sets (probably except the jumpsuit one, but that&#39;s not the classic shell body print) come with goofy faces. Raph is ok.. nothing special, still exclusive to this set (if I&#39;m not mistaken). The other foot soldier is just your normal black foot soldier, nothing special.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very fun! I love building lairs/houses and this set is all charm. The stairs technique is a bit clumsy, but the idea is&nbsp;really amazing! Using the window pieces (if that&#39;s how they&#39;re used) for the up/down movement is a sweet idea. The minus here is that sometimes the ladder gets jammed and doesnt&nbsp;close up very well, depending on how your bricks are lined up.&nbsp;The very top is absolutely gorgeous, with transparent blue and white pieces. The stairs and saw shooting play features are epic.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is quite sturdy (expect the side windows, which are meant to be easy to bring down by Raphael&#39;s plane), the plane is nice as well, liked it much better than the one in Baxter Robot Rampage. Overall the lair looks very nice, light on or off ;)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t know why this set doesn&#39;t get enough credit, but it is really good. Maybe its the RRP, maybe its rating from people who are not into TMNT, but if you ARE into TMNT and you can get this around 40$&nbsp;or even 45$, then you will not regret it. Worth every penny.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: Nice way to get 2 turtles AND Shredder in one set.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Beautiful design<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Fun build<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lots of weapons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Good playability<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many purple parts<br />
<br />
Cons: High RRP (get it for less if you can. Hard to find cheap deals for this one)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Shredder&#39;s cape gets messed up when you try to sit him down on his throne.&nbsp;</p>

It&rsquo;s a nice looking set that serves as a base for the Foot Clan to operate out of, you can add on to it with parts for your own MOC Vehicle garages for the Foot Clan vehicles from the other sets. It&rsquo;s a really great set, for what it is, we&rsquo;ll discuss all the aspects in this review.</span></span></span></span></p>

The action shot on the front is awesome, and really showcases the set quite nicely. The comic on the back is another fun one, I kind of wish the comics on the boxes were re-printed inside the manuals because if you recycle the boxes you&rsquo;re going to be getting rid of them.</span></span></span></span></p>

Mostly corresponding to the numbered bags, though not quite. With a box this large I half expected them to be protected in cardboard, however it isn&rsquo;t, so be mindful of potential creased, curled or damaged manuals. The first one ends with the Minifigure checklist on the last page, the second includes the cross-promotional images.</span></span></span></span></p>

If you&rsquo;re looking for pieces from this set and not wanting to pay for the full set, I&rsquo;m certain you can find them on Bricklink. You can also find a lot of glow-in-the-dark studs in this set too.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s unique to this set, he includes his two sai and features the standard printing found on turtle torsos and legs.</span></span></span></span></p>

Despite being captured by the Foot he still has his weapon. To make it easier to escape I guess. Not much more to say here.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Foot Soldier: Your standard Foot Soldier here, nothing new to say about the print work or anything else. Also he isn&rsquo;t unique to the set, I am really tired of LEGO giving these guys that stupid mace weapon though, the flail with the chain just doesn&rsquo;t strike me as a proper Ninja weapon. At least not for the Foot, he definitely could use one of the spare katana in this set as his standard weapon.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Shredder: This version has the same print found on the Shredder&rsquo;s Dragon Bike Minifigure. The differences here are the black torso and legs used instead of the alternative armour colour. He has a purple cape, this is the Shredder you expect from Ninja Turtles. Covered in dark imposing armour and ready to strike at a moments notice. He has all the same accessories as his previous version. He does have a new facial print though, with an open mouthed scowl or shouting expression, it&rsquo;s a nice difference for the character and I&rsquo;m glad we got at least two distinct expressions for him before the Theme ended.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Robo Foot Ninja: This uses all the same parts as a regular Foot Ninja, the only difference here is the new extension piece used by Lord Garmadon to give a mini-figure four arms instead of two. There&rsquo;s not much more to say, with the print being the same as a regular Foot you could change it into one easily by leaving off the extension piece. Honestly that piece doesn&rsquo;t really fit in properly on this Minifigure. The special armour sculpted onto it for Lord Garmadon doesn&rsquo;t match what a robot foot soldier has from the show, since they are made by Kraaang bodies. But I wouldn&rsquo;t see LEGO making a new sculpt for one Minifigure, too bad it would have been nice though.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: This bag builds the turtle vehicle and the bottom section of Shredder&rsquo;s Lair. The vehicle is a fast and simple build, nothing too impressive to discuss with it however there are two stickers that are used for detail work on the tail-fins of the flying vehicle.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Shredder&rsquo;s Lair is a much more involved build as it is broken up between the numbered bags. This lower section of the lair is mostly building the central stairs leading up to the platform where Shredder&rsquo;s throne will go, but it doesn&rsquo;t include the stairs, just the framework for where they&rsquo;re meant to go.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: This is where you get to build the stairs and the rest of the lower side areas beneath the central stage where the throne for Shredder will go. In other words the jail cell and a small weapons storage area. This bag also includes the foot soldier and Mikey Minifigures.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Building the stairs is pretty interesting, considering that part of the play features of the set are also being built into the staircase itself, as you go from one level on to the next you might feel a bit repetitive as some of the steps are similar, but all in all this is a really satisfying part of the build. All of the baseplates from bag 1 have been secured now so nothing is in danger of falling apart while you&rsquo;re securing it and shoring up the foundations. The manual ends with you completing the sliding staircase play feature and that, once it&rsquo;s finished, looks fun, but can be a nuisance during the next build as it will slide back and forth while you&rsquo;re working on the upper walls and throne.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 3: This finishes the lair build with the large windows of the Dojo and Shredder&rsquo;s Throne. This part of the build is fast and fun, I love the way the windows work and the little roof thing is a really fun little section to build because of all the clear 1x1 bricks that make a great looking pattern. My only complaint about this build is that the side windows are only attached with jumpers, so they like to fall off and wiggle around whenever you move the lair and change the way it&rsquo;s displayed. The finished product is impressive though, let&rsquo;s discuss why right now.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is the headquarters of the Foot Clan. As such you have a lot of dark colours, much different from the Sewer Lair of the Turtles. As models go this is a solid looking one, it is a large open room, with Shredder&rsquo;s throne at the top and large windows looking out on the city of New York. It is unfortunate that this set isn&rsquo;t as large as the turtle lair, it would have been nice, but the model is still a complete set piece. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like anything is missing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There is a central set of stairs made with mostly purple and black pieces that lead up the Shredder&rsquo;s Throne, it&rsquo;s quite imposing looking and the play feature for the stairs isn&rsquo;t intrusive at all. You basically have a tab in back that you pull out to lower the stairs, exposing a hidden projectile launcher. Push the technic pin and launch the technic gear, also known here as a large saw blade, at the turtles storming the lair. It&rsquo;s a very clever little play feature and suits the Foot Clan quite well, I can see them making such an elaborate trap.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Under the floor on either side are two small alcoves, one is used as a dungeon, where Mikey has been trapped. The other holds a spare weapon rack with shuriken and katana. The next play feature here is the pull-away jail wall, using the hook on the end of Raph&rsquo;s vehicle, you can simulate the daring rescue of Michelangelo by flying off and pulling the wall out at the same time.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The final play feature for the set is Shredder&rsquo;s Throne itself, the thing is sitting on a single jumper, pull it up and you can have Shredder rocket away to escape and fight the turtles again another day.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">All in all this temple build for the Foot Clan works great, it has many impressive design choices, with slanted windows a large open space to put at least half a dozen Foot Soldiers, and some interesting non-intrusive play features. There&rsquo;s also numerous glow-in-the dark studs littered all around the set, once they&rsquo;ve been charged by light and then shrouded in darkness it makes for an eerie looking place.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Raph&rsquo;s Vehicle is standard fair. The model looks like it was cobbled together in the sewers using whatever parts the turtles could find, the rescue hook for breaking Mikey out doesn&rsquo;t stick out too badly and the wings aren&rsquo;t too big or get in the way. It&rsquo;s really not much, but it adds nicely to the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The small foot catapult isn&rsquo;t much to talk about either, it holds a minifugre and you can launch them at the enemy, it does what is advertised and fits in nicely as an additional micro-model play feature for the younger crowd this set is aimed at.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set is a must own set for Turtle fans, the main model is very well put together and only has one flaw in my mind, the fact that the windows attached only by jumpers fall off far too easily. It includes four unique mini-figures and is priced well for what you get, being a TRU exclusive it isn&rsquo;t that easy to find, with the retirement and discontinuation of the Turtle Theme you&rsquo;re best chance to find it these days is the secondary market. I would still recommend this set though, it&rsquo;s fairly decent, the stickers for detailing aren&rsquo;t too numerous and if you&rsquo;re a completist for this Theme you&rsquo;re going to want it. Plus it&rsquo;s the only &lsquo;base&rsquo; set you&rsquo;ll find for the Foot Clan.</span></span></span></span></p>
