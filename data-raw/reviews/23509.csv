<p>There is obviously no building this key chain, it comes whole in the package</p>

<p>Be &nbsp;warned that no parts are removable, you can not take this apart as you could a regular minifigure.<br />
The bottom part however&nbsp;can be connected to other lego if you wanted so and the legs are separately movable.</p>

<p><br />
I feel this is a pretty accurate version of Boba Fett and a cool little piece to add to my keys.</p>

"ChrisBricks81","2017-07-22T18:55:31.747Z","Great but fragile keychain","<p>This is a very nice keychain. As a big Boba Fett&nbsp;fan it was the obvious choice when I needed a new one.</p>

<p>It just looks great although it doesn&#39;t have a range finder. It just wouldn&#39;t stick to the head ofcourse&nbsp;when it&#39;s in your pocket.</p>

<p>One big big downside about this awesome keychain... The paint doesn&#39;t stay on. Within a week the paint started to come off as my keys scratched&nbsp;the minifig.</p>

<p>would have been nice if it had some extra tough coating or something.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-08-13T06:56:28.087Z","Got it for the minifigure ","<p>So I&rsquo;m not too interested in a keychain, however, I wanted a Boba Fett minifigure&nbsp;and the ones available on Bricklink&nbsp;are almost as expensive as the sets that include them. So I saw this as a cheap way to obtain a minifigure, even if it isn&rsquo;t perfect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On YouTube I saw videos showing how to remove the keychain by heating it with a candle until you can just pull it out, so I figured it was worth a try. Turns out that it is just as easy as they make it look in the videos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, there is a&nbsp;hole in the top of his helmet, but I can deal with that. It does sit a little loose on the head so you may need to be a bit careful while playing. You can attach a rage finder to the helmet as well, but it doesn&rsquo;t come with one. The head is blank, so you may want to swap it out with a storm trooper head. The jet pack and cape are normal. But it&rsquo;s the body and legs that are interesting. The body is missing the peg that the head attaches to. Instead, there is a hole where that peg should be. The legs, likewise are missing their two pegs and they have been replaced with a single long peg that protrudes thru the hole where the neck should be. This is sufficient for holding the minifigure together, and while it is assembled it looks perfectly normal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So may son won&rsquo;t be able to completely swap out body parts on this minifigure, but he can swap out many of them, and it&rsquo;s kind of cool to have this unique construction. I&rsquo;m happy to have this and am glad I didn&rsquo;t have to pay a fortune for a legit Boba&nbsp;Fett!</p>
