"Novelty","2007-08-29T10:04:27.16Z","Cross - Off","This set contains of a structure with two crossbows and a shield attached, built atop a turntable thing and manned by a minifig.  There's almost no building to this set and the only movable part outside of the minifig is the turn-table.  Nevertheless it has some nice design points - the quiver on the back of the minifig for the crossbow and the lion shield in front protecting the minifig.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-19T12:46:47.86Z","Useful to castle","This is a small set from the knights kingdom subtheme (don't knights' kingdom), due to be small, I am reviewing this set in comparision with small ones. The set have a little building, and too a minifigure and some itens. Due to the size, this set was also packaged with sweets as the 1287 set, or in a polybag, as the 4811 set. The minifigure have a helmet proper to archers and a piece on his back to looks like with arrows. A shield was putted in the front of the little building, and two crossbows at the sides. A plate is under the building to keep it. Is easy to put any minifigure in this small building and play with this. This have a good design altough small, due to the shields and the good positioned crossbows. If you think that the design frustrates, is easy to make a new one, with more castle sets or little ones like this. Is good to play with the minifigure, hanging something like the crossbows or the shield, or only moving this at the building. The playability and builting is great to a small set, deserving a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-11-03T02:06:45.43Z","Defence Archer","<p>In the long run I can't complain about the price of this given that it found it's way to me as a Stocking Stuffer one year. So it provided a few minutes of amusement putting it together. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is rather small with 1 minifigure featuring at the time, a new style of helmet for Castle that I hadn't seen before. I also like this set as it's on a turrent with a pair of crossbows providing long range attack and defense and unlike many other small castle sets I've gotten over the years, this one is not a catapult. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I'd been thinking at the time, I might have gone out and gotten a few more to create a bit of an army build with them, not just one... though I might be able to easily duplicate this from other pieces.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,5
"Ernst","2011-06-17T17:41:41.247Z","A nice additional set","<p>Overall a&nbsp;3 brick rate because it is a nice set, nothing spectacular but no complaints either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience not more than 2 bricks because there is not much to build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nice parts, 2 bows to shoot and a shield for protection. A nice&nbsp;thought is the turntable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability is ok as long as you have other sets from this theme. Just place him in front of the Castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A cheap little set so value for money is 4 bricks, thanks to the low price.</p>
