<p>The batgirl keyring is a cool one as it is based of a minifigure that was exclusive to one 2014 DC superheroes set .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure is nice as it has the exclusive cowl hair combo from the set , a nice exclusive face print , a lovely lavender cape , an accurate torso print and plain black legs .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is my third favourite keyring in my collection just behind the gingerbread man and the BB9-E . I would recommend this to Batman fans but I do believe it is retired .&nbsp;</p>
