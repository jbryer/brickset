Includes 2 ninja, a gray and a black; 2 soldiers, a blue and a red, and one samurai with armor to the body and also a helmet with a golden piece. The weapons are some katanas and a shotgun. It don't have buildings or horses, but have also two flags, one blue, another red, with the spears too used as weapon of the castle theme's joust. It is useful, for an army builder, or for a small set, for these categories, i rate this 5/5. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

also this set comes with sort of a poster. its got alot of the 1998 ninja sets on it and this one. the back has 1999 sets.

overall 10/10 and good if you want alot of ninjas!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Chaz777","2009-04-10T09:37:18.593Z","Building=0. Playability=Through the roof!","This really is an army builder. Unlike the new star wars army builder sets that give you four pretty much identical guys plus an unnecessary vehicle (7668, 7667), this, as you can see, gives you five interesting (read: cool) minifigs, each with their own personal weapon/ accessory.
As well as being good for populating your 18th century Japanese landscape, I think this is also a perfect set for little kids who just want to play, because all they have to do is put the minifigs together and get playing, and all the accessories make that possible. I know this, because that's what I did when I first got this set.
As for Ninja collectors, even though I know you will want this set anyway because it's part of the collection, It might be worth hunting down one or two more, because it fills out all areas of the collection, giving you an extra robber for 6088, a spare Samurai and his apprentice for 6083, and two more ninjas for, well, they looks cool with any set, don't they?
And obviously, you can never have too many Katanas, blunderbuss's, flintlocks or battle flags, which is what you're getting here.
So really, this is a great and useful set. The reason I've given it a four is because it isn't really a proper set, but credit where it's due, this is still cool.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-14T13:17:24.94Z","LEGO Castle (Ninja) - Ninja Knights Review","This set is more a battle pack for the LEGO Castle (Ninja) theme. We get a gray ninja, a black ninja, a blue swordsman, a red swordsman and the chief. We get two cool and rare flag pieces. This set has two gray katanas, a black katana and two rifles. If you want to build a ninja army I would recommend you to buy as much of this set you can. This set doesn't have any play features but it's still a good set if you want these minifigs and their accessories.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"WoutStopmotion","2013-10-23T16:20:55.51Z","Perfect Ninja figure collection!","I recently bought this set for about 10€, which seems a fair price, since it's a bit old. In the end it's a good set with quite some figure parts to make customs with.<br><br><b>Building Experience<br><br></b>What building experience? When i bought this set, they came assembled already... And even if they weren't, there is almost no building experience. Let's see what we've got - a figure collection. You get five Ninja themed figures. Figures aren't hard to build at all. The fun i got out of building was posing them like on the box art (although i didn't got a box - the set came in a plastic bag and a piece of paper saying ""4805"" on it).<br><br><b>Parts<br><br></b>Parts review? Let's just call this a figure review. The figures you get are a bunch of ninjas. The figures look very nice and they have nice design, and nice parts. You get Ninja headgear (which i can see used as terrorist headgear - no, that's just for people that create custom figs!), flags, two cool guns, three various coloured Ninja swords, some cool faces, and some torsos could look very nice on custom figures (the guy on the left's torso could be used as a vest or something like it, and so on).<br><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>Not too much playability, but still some. A kid could easily just play war with the figures for hours, you could make a castle for the figures, build stuff with the parts, and so on. But still - it has no play features or anything. It's still just a figure collection, i quote another review title: ""army maker"".<br><br><b>Value for Money</b><br><br>The price has raised a lot because of how old this set is. 10€ seems kind of much for this set, but in the end it's pretty much worth it, since the figures and parts are very cool.<br><h4><b>Overall Rating</b></h4>Nice figures with nice parts. You can use them for a lot of stuff, but still, it remains a simple figure collection and some stuff isn't as useful as the rest. A three out of five.<br>",TRUE,4,3,2,3,3
