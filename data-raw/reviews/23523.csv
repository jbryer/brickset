<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I tore the bag open with ease.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>He was all there.&nbsp; The cape is a great color and I don&#39;t mind the new 52 design.&nbsp; He is a great addition my LEGO Justice League.&nbsp; The quality is great and I think we can all agree that DC sets and Characters&nbsp;are in huge&nbsp;demand.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you missed him, grab him quickly on the second hand market.&nbsp; I hope he shows up in a set later.&nbsp; We are going to need a Daily Planet, Fortress of Solitude, Wayne Manor, Gotham Museum of Technology and Science, and a Justice League Satellite Headquarters.&nbsp; I think we still need the following villains;&nbsp;Gorilla Grod (hulk style Figure), Braniac, Black Manta, Dark Seid, Doomsday, Sinestro and Metallo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is so much material to draw from with DC and I hope we get years and years worth of sets.&nbsp;</p>
