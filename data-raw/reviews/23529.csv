"steinman17","2014-05-12T18:58:09.26Z","Very nice set with a ton of features","<p>One of my favorite images from the Star Wars movies is of the Sandcrawler way off in the distance, just a blip on the screen. This set is the opposite of that iconic image, as it is massive. It is loaded with features and sits prominently on my display above all other sets I own. Definitely the centerpiece of my collection.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is huge, it even has a box inside of the main box. I&#39;m guessing it is for structural purposes so the box doesn&#39;t collapse on itself when stored. The Instruction booklet is one big tome of star wars info and Lego diagrams. I can see myself storing it right alongside my other Lego books. My second biggest gripe with the whole set though, is the background color in the instructions. It makes it difficult to discern the blacks/browns/greys of the set. This never really posed a problem, just made me do many double takes to make sure I had the right pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Comes with tons of various pieces, obviously based on its size, and the little details on the hull are fantastic. Really gives the set character. My biggest gripe, and I docked a whole star for this, is the sticker use. I would expect that when paying this much for a set The pieces would be printed on, but there is a whole sticker sheet that must be applied. I am very OCD about sticker placement, and it brought me unnecessary anxiety when applying them to such an expensive set that will be displayed prominently among my collection. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Huge assortment of figures, the centerpiece of which is the four Jawas. They are very nice, with better eyes, than previous Jawas, however many will not be happy there are no capes, but this wasn&#39;t a problem for me, because I never really liked capes on minifigures. Also includes a Luke Skywalker (with a lightsaber, although he doesn&#39;t yet have on in the movie), Uncle Owen, updated C-3PO, R2-D2, and the various other droids from the scene.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fantastic. Broken down into 16 numbered builds, this set was very fun to put together. Some of the ways the designers made the various odd angles, especially the nose, is very cool. The crawler has a very solid technic structure that all the parts are fastened into making the whole set fell very nice when picking it up. Nothing feels loose or iffy. Putting all 304 pieces of the treads together was pretty tedious, but nothing to dock any points for. Two or three times, however, i missed an arrow pointing for me to push some technic fasteners in to lock a new part in places and I had to go back and do this, but I got them all.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Like I&#39;ve said before, this this is amazing. It has many action pieces. The best of which are the front hatch, which acts just like a draw bridge, and the way the technic pieces make the rear wheels turn. The crane system is very cool, as well as the doors on each side to slide the crates into. Until something bigger and better comes along, this set will be the centerpiece of my collection for a long time.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Couldn&#39;t be happier with my purchase. If you love Star Wars and have the cash, get this set. You wont regret it.</p>

"legodan1974","2014-05-13T19:52:49.72Z","Fun Assembly, My Kid Loves It","<p>This is one build I won&#39;t forget, in a good way.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a keeper</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>More reddish brown than you will ever need.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The 4 jawas are simply a must have</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Oddly fun</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A big hit with the fascinated six year old.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I bought this on April 30th 2014, as I knew I had a few days off in early May to put it together.&nbsp; With the son at school, I assembled it over the course of three days.&nbsp; This would be a monumental task if done in a rush, but done at a relaxed pace, it was strangely enjoyable.</p>

<p>The many droids and figures keep my six year old puttering around this monster in the mornings before school.&nbsp; The play features are neat, and the stow away storage bins are great.&nbsp; At night I separate and hide the &#39;six piece robot&#39; into all of the secret containers, and in the morning I find the little guy assembled again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously not priced to be a child&#39;s toy, but the bonus of having my son love it so much is that every time he pulls a wall off, or drops a book on it, I have an excuse to haul out the hefty instruction manual and fix it.</p>

<p>I explained the cost to my wife as &#39;buying memories with my son.&#39; I will remember building it when he was six, (it took 3 days!) and I will remember him playing with it too.&nbsp; And this thing is going to be around a long time.&nbsp; It would take decades just to break down in a landfill.</p>

"Duq","2014-12-30T02:20:55.213Z","Fantastic set - even if it's too small","<p>The Sandcrawler set was never going to be proper minifig-scale; it would have to be a meter long and half a meter tall. However without the minifigs it would be a fairly dull brown box on wheels so the designers had to make a compromise. Did they get away with it? Hell yes!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is BIG as you&#39;d expect from&nbsp; 3000+ part set. Bags are numbered 1-16 and for some reason some bags are in a plain white box inside the main box. The back of the box, along with the usual pictures that show play elements, strangely says &quot;Exclusive building instructions included&quot;. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re any more exclusive than any other set instructions; they tend to be unique to a single set...</p>

<p>The instructions are in a single 308 page book which interestingly starts with a few pages about the prototype and the set designers. The instructions are very good and easy to follow. The same can not be said about the online instructions. I built the set with my wife, with one of us working from the downloaded pdf instructions. At times they are so badly pixelated I needed to switch to the book to see the details.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>3296 of them. Looking at the set image it&#39;s hardly surprising that the bulk of the parts are brown plates in various shapes and sizes, some unique to this set, with some dark tan, dark orange, dark brown and tan mixed in. There&#39;s also a good bit of Technic for the internal structure and cranes. And let&#39;s not forget 304 Technic thread links.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Brickset lists 14 minifigures but 4 of those are brick-built droids and another 3 are R2-D2 and two cousins. C-3PO is included and of course there are Jawa&#39;s; four of them, with two different torso prints. Uncle Owen is there, but no aunt Beru, and of course Luke. Most of them are unique to this set while some appear in one or two other sets.</p>

<p>While she doesn&#39;t appear in the droid-buying scene I would have liked to see aunt Beru and I definitely would have liked more Jawas. Still, the minifigs you do get are all pretty good.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a good set to build with two people; once the first part of the chassis is built a good few parts are built as modules that are attached left and right. The tracks are a bit repetitive to build but otherwise there&#39;s good variety in build techniques; some Technic for internal structures and cranes, greebling on the outside and various ways to connect sub assemblies at all sorts of angles.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once you&#39;re done there&#39;s an impressive monster sitting on your table. The overall shape is great and there&#39;s enough colour variation to break the brown monotony. It&#39;s a pity though that the colour patterns are symetrical; left and right are exact mirror images. At the back, where the engines are, there&#39;s more opportunity for details and it doesn&#39;t disappoint; it&#39;s Pete Reid in brown ;-)</p>

<p>Where this set blows all previous UCS sets out of the water is in play functions. It rolls and steers (but not on a smooth surface), the front ramp can be lowered and most top and side panels open to allow access to the interior. Because of the size there&#39;s just the one big space inside; no multiple engine rooms and workshops.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a Jawa speeder bike, a working crane at the front and a working crane inside and there are different grips that can be used with the crane. There are also of course many boxes and crates for the various droids.</p>

<p>The bridge is a bit cramped and has no real windows. This again is where the size/scale compromise bites but the designers have done a good job; the outside looks the part and there&#39;s just enough room and equipment inside to play.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a fantastic set. It&#39;s not cheap, especially when you consider that 10% of the parts are chain links, but it&#39;s worth the money. It looks great from the outside and it&#39;s full of play features on the inside. There are a few details that could be improved but that shouldn&#39;t stop anyone from buying it.</p>

"zipsforbananas","2015-01-29T14:43:12.3Z","A very nice set, though I sense an identity crisis...","<p>This is undoubtedly a very good set, impressive in a whole host of ways, but something doesn&#39;t quite sit right for me. Nothing that ruins the set mind, but a bit of an identity crisis.<br />
A lot has been made of this being an Ultimate Collectors&#39; Set but not having a name plaque. The standard of build and the size of it sure do make it UCS, but the lack of plaque, the abundance of minifigures and the smorgasbord of play features all suggest it&#39;s not. Perhaps it is, but all those factors disqualified it from getting a plaque!<br />
What all that means is, for a&nbsp;UCS set it&#39;s lacking something, feeling ever so slightly compromised by the play features, and for a play set it&#39;s just downright huge and expensive,&nbsp;and at 14+ it&#39;s surely out of the ability range of many of its target audience.</p>

<p>Now that slight negativity is out of the way, on with the extremely positive review!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is huge, and I made the mistake of not asking for a bag (they cost 5p in Wales!) meaning I had to carry the ungainly thing in two hands, perching it in one arm whenever I needed to scratch my nose, but always worrying I&#39;d drop it with how large it is! (I almost fell over getting off the bus too, but that was nothing to do with the box, totally embarrassing, and I saved myself without putting a hand down so maybe I redeemed myself?)</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great box too, with a beautiful Tatooine (<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">double)sunset and a diorama on the front, and what would normally be a full box print on the back, next to a montage of the play features. Plenty to tempt you to buy it!</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">And the instructions, strangely called &quot;Exclusive&quot; on the box (which set doesn&#39;t include it&#39;s own exclusive instructions?), continue the quality feel. It&#39;s common now in 2015, but this may have been amongst the first sets to have on single bound book, and it suits the set well. There&#39;s a really nice 6 pages of info about the model at the start in UCS fashion, and the instructions from there are well paced and clear enough.</span></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts is where any set of this size is bound to excel, and though shades of brown dominate it&#39;s a welcome break from Star Wars light grey, and there is a great selection.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of Technic, with some very interesting pieces for a System set. There are some nice hinges and plenty of SNOT pieces. Of course&nbsp;there&#39;s a ton of brown plates, but some great wedge shapes, and a lot of dark tan and some dark orange too. Plus there&#39;s the tracks, loads and loads of tracks!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As much as minifigures&nbsp;seem strange in a UCS set, it&#39;s becoming more common (I&#39;ve only got 4 UCS sets and they all come with minifigures), and it a System scale they really suit, in fact they really make the set.</p>

<p>Missing for a long time, since the 2005 Sandcrawler, we get four&nbsp;<strong>Jawas</strong>&nbsp;here. Though some are disappointed they don&#39;t have capes I think they look good as they are. You wouldn&#39;t get to see the back printing with capes either, and it&#39;s fantastic. The torso design is varied, two different designs for the bandaliers and&nbsp;two of each. The classic hood looks good as ever. And seeing them in the flesh I now think the eyes look really good, not as big and cartoony as they seemed from the photos, but nice and bright within the hood. The little critters look as mysterious and suspicious as they should!</p>

<p>I find the&nbsp;<strong>Luke Skywalker</strong>&nbsp;a little disappointing. He&#39;s the same as the Cantina set, and though his hair piece is excellent and the printing is really good I don&#39;t see how either of the expressions suit the set all that well. And his face is severely suffering from the post-2014 over-detailed ageing. He&#39;s the wrong side of the Wampa attack and bacta tank (and Mark Hamill&#39;s&nbsp;car crash!) to have this many lines and wrinkles, it&#39;s a real shame. The lightsaber is strange too as we&#39;re the wrong side of meeting Obi-Wan for Luke to have it yet, but I guess a Luke in a play&nbsp;set would be odd without one (yep, it&#39;s a UCS play set).</p>

<p>The same can&#39;t be said for&nbsp;<strong>Uncle&nbsp;</strong><strong>Owen Lars</strong>&nbsp;however. His torso and leg printing is brilliant, the hair that also appears on General Cracken&nbsp;is fantastic, and on a character of his age the face printing is perfect too! His expressions are great, and I especially love his stubble! The only slight weak point is the light tan printing on his dark brown legs is a little see through, but that&#39;s pretty normal so it&#39;s hardly a criticism.</p>

<p>The other 7&nbsp;(8?) of the 13(/14) figures are all&nbsp;<strong>Droids</strong>,&nbsp;so&nbsp;for a set based on a droid warehouse we get the full payoff!</p>

<p><strong>C-3PO</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>R2-D2</strong>&nbsp;are the best versions yet.&nbsp;<strong>Threepio</strong>&#39;s printing is just sublime, all dirty and in need of an oil bath, and with his restraining bolt on, he&#39;s finally got one silver leg! Well, part silver, as far as the printing will go! And&nbsp;<strong>Artoo</strong>&nbsp;is surprisingly a complete reprint, in a very, very nice dark blue, and with the slightly chromed dome, but the classic printing unlike the Ewok Village&#39;s use of the Clone Wars design. Maybe there&#39;s not much to that, but I&#39;m glad for it.</p>

<p>The other two&nbsp;<strong>astromechs</strong>&nbsp;are nice.&nbsp;<strong>R5-D8</strong>&nbsp;is blatantly&nbsp;<strong>R5-D4</strong>&nbsp;who we saw in the most recent X-Wing, but it&#39;s always nice to have him, his conical head piece is still a nice new-ish feature, and to be fair he&#39;s integral to this scene in the film! The mysteriously anonymous&nbsp;<strong>R2 Unit</strong>&nbsp;is great too, green and white, adding to the overall colour palette! Great filler figures.</p>

<p>The highlights of the minifigures&nbsp;(though the Jawas and Owen are great)&nbsp;are&nbsp;the three brick-built droids.<br />
The <b>Gonk Droid</b>&nbsp;is lovely in dark grey and with I think&nbsp;the only printed tile of the set. I&#39;m a little bemused as to why SNOT pieces are used to put studs on the top where they would have been anyway, but he&#39;s a fun build none-the-less. Something makes me want the post-box design from the old set, but nostalgia apart, this is the best version of him yet.<br />
The&nbsp;<strong>Treadwell Droid</strong>&nbsp;is just plain fun, a handful&nbsp;of&nbsp;Technic and various clip pieces create a fantastic droid, the flick-fire piece with binoculars on gives him bags of character, and the way the arms stick out and spin will be sure to make him a favourite with anyone who wants to play with the set, though he may be a little fragile.<br />
And the absolute triumph of the set is the&nbsp;<strong>R1-Series Droid</strong>&nbsp;in its gloriously respendent dark green with yellow piping. He&#39;s fun to put together with a load of small pieces, and standing so tall he stands out in every way among the selection.<br />
(There&#39;s a six piece &#39;droid&#39; too, but seriously, he looks like a bad day in an advent calendar! I can&#39;t bear to count him as a figure!)</p>

<p>All in all there are all the figures you&#39;d need to recreate everything from after the escape pod crash up to the droids being bought, and of course finding the destroyed Sandcrawler later on. The minifigures look fantastic lined up next to the model in display, in diorama, and of course in play.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is where the model comes a long way off being a play set, any younger builder would surely need a lot of help, and the tracks bored me silly.&nbsp;14+ is right for the standard of the build, but that&#39;s a big scratch against this being a play set.</p>

<p><strong>The overall&nbsp;build</strong>, except for the tracks, is engaging and rewarding. I did it in a three short-ish&nbsp;sessions, an hour or so on the afternoon I bought it to get the first four bags and the majority of the frame made, a little burst that evening to get the rest and the tracks done, and back in the morning to put all the panels on. I&#39;m quite glad I split it that way, the frame was really fun to build though it was slow in a few Technic- heavy parts, the plates were all really fun,&nbsp;and having the tracks out of the way on their own while watching TV was nice!</p>

<p>The <strong>first 6 bags</strong> that build the <strong>frame</strong> are well paced. You build the floor frame fairly quickly in bag one, cover it over and make the steering in bag two, and three and four build the sides up as far as they go. Bag five is a nice change of pace in the middle of it, putting the central sections of the sides on, curiously just resting in place to begin with. And then bag six pins them down with the larger Technic frame giving you the shape of the main body.</p>

<p><strong>Bags 7 and 8</strong>&nbsp;are the cumbersome tracks. As is their nature you build the same frame part with wheels eight times in all across the four track units, two per bag. Except for the central parts that attaches the two sides of each unit together and has the connection to the Sandcrawler&nbsp;the units are all identical. It&#39;s fun enough building the first one, it&#39;s just that all four and the 172 track pieces get wearing. Psych yourself up for it and push on through it though, it&#39;s not so bad really. And the way they sound when you trundle the beast across the floor is brilliant, almost making the build worth it!</p>

<p><strong>Bag 9</strong>&nbsp;has the last part of the frame and the door, and with it you see the whole shape of the vehicle. This is probably where you could bring in someone younger as the techniques are pretty simple from here on. From there in <strong>bags 10 to 13</strong> you build up the side panels with a bag for each side, the front and some lovely parts that clip in and fill in the gaps in the sides (masses of brown SNOT brackets in them! 32 in all!) with a bag again for each side. At this point the build looks largely complete. I went 10, 12, 11, 13&nbsp;so I could finish off a side at a time, and to split up the mirrored sections to minimise the repetitive feel and spread out the enjoyment of seeing it come together. I&#39;d really recommend it. Those clipped on gap-covering pieces are especially pleasing to place and worth savouring!</p>

<p><strong>Bag 14</strong> has the cockpit, nice for what it is and cleverly clipped in place on the frame for the crane built in bag 9, the front of the cockpit, and the beginnings of the roof. It feels like a real&nbsp;turning point in the build;&nbsp;it&#39;s just what you need when you&#39;re reaching the end of an epic job like this.</p>

<p><strong>Bag 15</strong>&nbsp;has the majority of the roof&nbsp;and a little remnant of the Technic build that I suppose is nice to have spread out here, and&nbsp;<strong>Bag 16</strong>&nbsp;is the final sprint, putting the roof on the cockpit, and then building up all the little bits for the play features&nbsp;and the awesome brick built figures. It&#39;s a nice wind down at the end, and except for the monotonous feel of the tracks the whole build was really nicely paced and fun.</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a&nbsp;great&nbsp;build, and the only complaint is pretty much unavoidable, top marks! You won&#39;t regret putting the time and effort in.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Judged on it&#39;s own the finished model is brilliant. The multitude of subtle and curious angles are great, it looks like a patched together rust bucket just like it should, but all together it looks coherent. The clipped on pieces that go between the sections on the side are a big part of this, they&#39;re really clever and do so much to both break up the vertical&nbsp;studs, and pull the separate sections together visually. The nose of the cockpit is a real treat too, how well the ball joint connections&nbsp;create the flare at the top of the slope and how nicely the front fits in. And I don&#39;t count it so much as a play feature as just an expected feature, the opening door at the front fits perfectly in place&nbsp;and lowers and raises so quickly with the nice chain mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetically </strong>I think it&#39;s a real treat.&nbsp;The mix of studs on the side with not a few plates or half plates (the 4x4 with 4 studs, or 4x6 with studs round three sides) is good, just enough to look textured. The little smatterings of colours, a lot of dark tan at the nose, just a little dark orange, and some dark brown, again are not plentiful but do just enough to break up the feel. And there aren&#39;t many greebles on the side, one section on the back of each side giving a little piping set back into the side, but really it doesn&#39;t seem to need it. Each side has the feature of the light tan door that looks great, and all those small variations with the constant change of angles, especially those lines of SNOT brackets adding some hollow studs too, break it up and make it look excellent.&nbsp;More than that, the back end is stuffed full of greebles and the roof has plenty too, I think it&#39;s got everything it could need.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s crawling with&nbsp;<strong>play features</strong>&nbsp;if you&#39;re that way inclined. The tracks steer nicely from the back with the fun-to-build system, accessibility&nbsp;to the interior is excellent with four side panels hinging up, two sections of the roof lifting off and the other hinging, and the ramp lowering. Pushing boxes through the sides is actually quite fun, and all the crane attachments, places to put them, pieces to sort, and the little truck to move them will give kids loads of ways to play with the set, turning it into a half garbage heap, half workshop like it&#39;s meant to be. The little storage pods on the sides are fun too, though the &#39;droid&#39; you can build with the parts is a bit pants!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great set, and compared to the last 2005 version it&#39;s superior in every conceivable way. The old brick built thing looks just plain clumsy next to the surprising&nbsp;nuances of this set,&nbsp;it&#39;s bigger too. 9 years one we&#39;d expect progress, and we&#39;ve got it!</p>

<p>And I wonder if perhaps&nbsp;I&#39;ve been making too much of the&nbsp;play set/UCS mix. The UCS side of it doesn&#39;t seem to suffer for it, so why not just see it as a bonus? It&#39;s a success as a UCS set in almost every way...</p>

<p>But I can&#39;t help but add almost in there. Next to the other UCS sets I have (Imperial Shuttle, Super Star Destroyer and Slave I)&nbsp;this set seems very small - especially next to the new Slave I which is almost &pound;100 cheaper&nbsp;this set looks expensive and tiny! Maybe that says more about Slave I than this set, but in my collection it looks like it fits with the AT-AT, Sailbarge and Tantive IV more than the UCS sets. It&#39;s maybe the biggest of them, and next to the Ewok Village I can&#39;t quite decide if it looks small or not. But to my mind it belongs in with those System sets, as a beast amongst them of course, but it&#39;s just not a UCS set in size and wow-factor. The value is genuinely good, maybe the play features do sap something from the UCS feel after all.</p>

<p>I really do like it, I&#39;m very glad I&#39;ve got it and would recommend it, but that little sense of not quite belonging means I can&#39;t quite bring myself to give it full marks. I suppose we shouldn&#39;t expect every set to excel in every way, so this is a great part of the Star Wars range, but it&#39;s somehow it feels every so slightly less than&nbsp;the standout it should have been.</p>

"Chemistry2101","2019-06-04T20:44:06.537Z","Is this really UCS?","<p>As suggested by the title of this review, I am dissatisfied by the characterisation of this set as Ultimate Collector Series,&nbsp;or rather, there are some features of this set that I don&#39;t feel fit in with what I at least have come to expect from the UCS line. My aim in this review is to explain why I hold such an opinion. On with the review.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>There are a fair number of technic pieces, and a lot of plates, but nothing really special or memorable. Obviously there are a lot of brown.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>The minifigs are seemingly one of the major selling points for this set, which is weird as a set branded as UCS, but nevertheless they are fantastic. The jawas reappear in LEGO form for the first time in a decade, Owen Lars is more detailed and more accurate than the previous version, and the large assortment of droids really make the Sandcrawler feel busy and bustling; the three astromechs are all wonderfully designed, C3PO is looking better than ever, and the Treadwell&nbsp;and Gonk&nbsp;droids are superb. Luke Skywalker however, simply is not. He should not have Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;lightsaber yet, and his face looks far too aged for the character at such an early point in the saga; it really doesn&#39;t look great. Still, I&#39;m sure anyone buying this set will probably already own a (or more likely, many)&nbsp;Tatooine-themed Luke, so won&#39;t be too bothered, as they will mostly be focused on all the other great minifigs.</p>

<p>The Model:</p>

<p>The model is highly detailed, and a massive improvement on its predecessor, with great usage of technic parts, lots of plates, and SNOT techniques to create a much better outcome than the brick built Sandcrawler we saw before. The inside is reasonably well detailed, with plenty of space for all the extra bits that come with the set; three crates, a small jawa craft, and attachments for both cranes. Once all of these extras are stuffed in, however, there isn&#39;t much space left, so don&#39;t expect to recreate any scenes inside the belly of the crawler. The front section has a bridge area for the jawa to pilot the Sandcrawler from, and this area actually works really well, with plenty of room. The front panel also unfolds in film accurate fashion to provide a ramp in and out. Overall the model looks superb, but to me the set feels quite small, especially for the piece count and price. My Sandcrawler is displayed in the same room as my other UCS sets and it&nbsp;definitely looks the smallest of all of these,&nbsp;even smaller UCS sets like Obi Wan&#39;s Jedi Starfighter. It&nbsp;is quite surprising that many of the&nbsp;other UCS sets&nbsp;feel bigger, when a lot of them&nbsp;have significantly fewer pieces. The Crawler does feel very dense though, so perhaps its&nbsp;size isn&#39;t too much of an issue, especially if you are going to display alongside other &quot;playsets&quot;. In all honesty I didn&#39;t really notice this until I got the UCS Imperial Shuttle,&nbsp;and that dwarfs even the Millennium&nbsp;Falcon.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>This is a fantastic design, and by far the best LEGO Sandcrawler to date, but it feels too much like a playset&nbsp;to me and doesn&#39;t really feel like it belongs among&nbsp;the other UCS sets.&nbsp;A superb set, and I would definitely recommend for anyone who wants a Sandcrawler as this is really the only decent version TLG has ever produced. If you are a UCS collector that wants big, detailed LEGO sets, I would still recommend it, but would say that you should not really expect a UCS. Notably it does not have a display plaque, a staple of UCS models. Additionally the number of minifgures is unusual and seems more indicative of a large playset, akin to the Death Star or Ewok Village, and certainly the numerous play features would back this up. Not only are there lots of them, but they do compromise the design somewhat in places, the most obvious example being the gear that protrudes through the roof that can be used to steer the crawler during play. It&#39;s a nice play feature but it compromises displayablility to an unacceptable level for a UCS set in my opinion, and further adds to my wondering whether or not TLG meant for this to be UCS in the sense that most UCS sets are. Who knows what they think most of the time, I certainly don&#39;t. What I do know is that this is a fantastic playset, but only a mediocre display set, so in terms of whether you should buy it, it really depends what you&#39;re looking for in this set. If you&#39;re only into big, detailed display models, I&#39;d recommend most other UCS sets first; if you want a set with play value, or like displaying all your LEGO Star Wars sets, you won&#39;t be disappointed.</p>

"scalawag","2020-06-14T07:15:13.5Z","Awesome Sandcrawler","<p>This is a really awesome set.</p>

<p>The build is great with a lot of interesting techniques used in construction and some really nice engineering which makes this a very solid build when completed.</p>

<p>The minifig line up is great too with some nice exclusive figures and some brick built droids.</p>

<p>For a UCS set this has a lot of play features (yes it is a UCS set. &nbsp;Lego decides what is in the UCS range and this says UCS on the box!). &nbsp;</p>

<p>2 Cranes, steering, drawbridge style front ramp, storage crates and boxes, storage compartments, control deck, moveable/removable panels and a lot more besides. &nbsp;This is something you could play with for hours and still find new things to do.</p>

<p>I totally love this set and would recommend it to anyone. &nbsp;The only downside to this set is the price now it has been retired but to be fare these can be had for a reasonable price and are not crazy over expensive like some retired sets can be.</p>

<p>If you like how it looks then buy one if you can. &nbsp;You won&#39;t regret owning this set.</p>

"Vikn","2021-02-05T03:48:47.457Z","The ""set that got away"" as a child, improved in near every way","<p>When I was a kid I pined for the original Sandcrawler set but never was able to get it. It embodied one of my favorite Star Wars Aesthetics, the grimy, industrial SCIFI vibe that much of Tattooine and especially the Jawas held. For me, the only comparable SW aesthetic were&nbsp;the bounty hunter/Hutt/Criminal areas, locations and scenes.</p>

<p>I got back into Lego for the first time as an adult in early 2019, right before my 26th birthday. That lasted until Christmas of that year. I had used up most of my display space and so I somewhat jokingly told my wife that I would stop buying Lego if I could cap off my hobby with the perfect set, in no way expecting her to get the very expensive, retired Sandcrawler She had no real issue with me getting Lego sets, as she is the same with&nbsp;fashion, specifically buying too much Lululemon, but we hyperbolically tease each other for money wasting hobbies.</p>

<p>Yet to my disbelief, she somehow got the vastly improved version of the set I&#39;d wanted as a kid. It was the largest set I&#39;d ever gotten at the time, still is near the top. So, mostly due to display space limitations, my interest turned to other hobbies for all of 2020. I recently got back into Lego and just started using Brickset.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If my reviews seem largely too positive, it is only because I am beginning the process of reviewing my older sets with those that really stand out to me, my big favorites.</p>

<p>I&#39;d imagine most or even all adults who were childhood fans of Lego had at least one set that represented&nbsp;<em>the one that got away. I </em>would also imagine that the Sandcrawler was that set for many. If you have the chance to get this set at a &quot;reasonable&quot; price, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate for a moment.</p>

<p>It is one of the more involved builds. While I can&#39;t imagine there are ant &quot;difficult&quot; sets for an adult to build (Colored step by step instructions basically make them all pretty easy) some sets involve more complex mechanisms and techniques. This is one of the better examples of such a set. I normally strongly dislike play features, being a 27yo man, they remain completely unused but still increase prices, but the features in the UCS Sandcrawler feel more like Lego&#39;s attempt to approximate a machine and the complexity of the Sandcrawler&#39;s fictional mechanics. They add to the experience, both build and display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is as almost good as it gets, even with the tedium of sorting through small brown pieces. The minifigures are great, I thought at least. I LOVE when a set includess a variation of buildable star wars droids. They&#39;re tiny and simple, but getting the chance to see an improved manifestation of the interesting droids that only briefly appear is just fun.</p>

<p>There is really not much to complain about with this set. I got VERY lucky with UCS sets, the only ones I have being the Slave I and this...having two of the best, I am not rushing to get any of the retired UCS sets that I am far less interested in. They&#39;ll seem worse relative to the two I have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a must-have for SW fans, that&#39;s basically all that needs to be said. Since I got it, I have seen the price rise steadily and so It&#39;s unfortunate that many won&#39;t be able to afford it...but IF you can and you love Lego Star Wars, I can&#39;t recommend this set highly enough.</p>

"RundownPear","2022-04-27T18:34:36.07Z","Decent UCS Set, an Amazing Lego Set","<p>This is a set that you really have to look at through the eyes of the 2014 Lego landscape. A time before the Assault on Hoth controversy and before the 18+ rebranding of all adult-focused Lego sets. Retailing at $299 (~$350 in 2022 USD) the Sandcrawler was a great addition to the UCS and larger Lego lineup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is simply fantastic. So many interesting techniques are used to achieve a steady frame and accurate angels. From the slight angle of the cockpit&#39;s roof, to the excellently done treads, this set earns its place as a UCS display model despite being a focused playset. It is stable and strong and the detailing is top tier. They were able to achieve a strong connection of the front ramp to the main body when closed, and it comes together with the main body panels perfectly. The size is large and the build feels heavy, despite not being minifigure scale it still towers over almost every other SW vehicle.</p>

<p>The interior contains a well-developed crane system with several attachments to move the included cargo boxes around and load them onto the included speeder. Although I wish the droid shop was included I&#39;m still satisfied with what they came up with. The biggest con is the side crane can not be deployed to the exterior without removing a majority of the vehicle&#39;s roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures fit perfectly with this set. You get Luke Skywalker, Owen Lars, R2 and C-3PO, two pairs of Jawas, two astromechs, and three brick built droids (including a Gonk). The figures are nice and complement the set well and can be used to set up a nice display scene recreating Owen Lars&#39; purchase of R2 and C-3PO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the biggest con of this set is the lack of a plaque, it would have complemented it very nicely like how they did it with the later UCS Falcon and AT-AT. The price back when this was released was also quite high, it was equivalent to $350 today which is the same as current MBS sets. I think $50 less would be more appropriate. This is a great set and I consider it a must-have if you can find it for a reasonable price.&nbsp;</p>
