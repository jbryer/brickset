"Novelty","2007-09-03T08:54:04.3Z","Bull Chop","A siege machine, this one is bulky and heavily armoured with two axes in front and two crossbows.  The wheels give it a clunky and bulky look.  There is a handle for holding the contraption and a flag for identification, both of which are good design touches.  What's missing is a way to attach the shield to the front of the cart, but failing that, the minifig can hold it over its head when the need arise.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-03T13:09:44.28Z","Axe cart","This small set is one of the castle theme and knights kingdom subtheme, was released in the year of 2000. Like some other castle little set, this is a small cart with a lot of weapons. Altough this is small, all the pieces included are useful for other sets. The minifigure is  a knight of the bull, that still good designed altough is simple. The minifigure have a crossbow, a shield and a helmet, too used in other castle sets. The cart is easy to build, features two wheels,difernet from some other carts, this is more big. The cart's base is too simple but it is increased with axes, a spear combined with a flag and another crossbow. Altough the building is easy, the design and color scheme are nice. As a small set, this have no much playability, is more to increase other castle sets. Overall, another good small set of the castle theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-07-13T05:30:55.357Z","Charging Bull! ","I have been meaning to review this one for a while, but other models kept being found. I thought this cart looked quite viscous when I first bought it, mainly due to the size and number of weapons. Its basic make-up is a 4x4 with wheels and a handle. I really like the way you get six weapons with it ( 2x Large Axe, 2x Cross Bow, Spear and Shield) which can really add to you play if you don't have a large collection. I also like the way the spear doubles as a mast for the flag, very bad guy like. 

My main concern with this model is the angle its on when held by the mini-fig. If he holds it with his hand the right way up the cart angels down making the axes very ineffective. It's like the handle is too low or the wheels are too small. To fix this you need turn the mini-figs hand upside down and also have him hold the cart more towards the top of the handle. Also if you axes have become slightly bent in storage or play, have them bending up to raise the level of the axes.

The mini-fig is quite cool with a brown top, bearing the bulls logo, black pants, sleeves and helmet. His face is quite detailed with eyebrows, bags under his eyes, freckles, fringe and his eyes are solid silver.

Overall this is a great model, aesthetically pleasing, nice colour scheme fitting in with era and team, and can be used individually or as an army builder (For weapons and men). I feel this models only let downs are that it really needed and second fig and the angel of the cart could have been designed to be easier for little kids. Due to this I feel this model is a 5/10 or Average. I think it is a good one for the castle fan or someone who loves weapons. Would recommend purchasing if spotted. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-11T10:07:16.487Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - Axe Cart Review","This set is a good set for army building and very easy to build as well. This set may doesn't have many play features but it looks very nice. The only problem is that the crossbows on the top are a little bit touchy. But if you look for some weapons which you need to build an army it's a good set. It's a neat little set to have but I would recommend you to buy the bigger sets first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Ernst","2011-06-17T17:59:05.72Z","One man army","<p>Very nice little set with lots of weapons and a good addition to the other Bull Knights sets, although some points of critisism too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building gets 2 bricks because there is not much too build here too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parts are ok although the wheels maybe better could have been the smaller ones with spokes. Missing is a sword, better would have been one sword&nbsp;instead of a crossbow. And a horse would have been a wellcome addition, considering the weight of the cart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability a 5, simply because it has all the qualities for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money a 4 because it's cheap and with all the weapons worth its money; average value â‚¬4,00 so available for everyone.</p>",TRUE,3,3,2,5,4
