<p><br />
The first thing most of us want to do when visiting&nbsp;Legoland&nbsp;is learn to build the large Park scale figs that populate the MiniLands, the coolest place in the Parks. It&#39;s not&nbsp;easy figuring out how to build one of these figs because you can&#39;t get very close to them in the Parks, and they require lots of bricks. &nbsp;So.......it is okay to cheat and buy this little set for about $20.US at FL or CA&nbsp;Legoland&nbsp;parks;&nbsp;you may find it on sale even cheaper if there are any left at this point.</p>

The parts are not particularly exciting, but what is so cool is that you can build either a tan faced or a brown faced family with this one set. I chose to build both and probably will do a yellow skin tone as well in the future. After building this set twice, I had more confidence that I could build in&nbsp;Legoland&nbsp;scale after all. It would be lots of fun to create a building in this scale for our new figs. And to make lots of varied friends for them to interact with in those settings. Building the set takes 20-30 minutes for most folks, and is not that difficult with the well drawn instructions.&nbsp;</p>

During my first visit to a Park (in Germany,) I didn&#39;t really get into the scale of the many figs because I was too busy photographing the luscious sights of MiniLand. &nbsp;As I visited the other five Parks and then returned to the FL &nbsp;Park three months ago, it began to sink in that this scale is nothing like anything most of us will ever build because it is just too large and requires&nbsp;too many bricks and too much space.</p>

<p><br />
But it still is fun to try to build in Park scale. And it definitely is challenging. That is where this set perfectly fills the bill. You come away feeling that you, too, can build these large figs your first attempt. Then it is a matter of changing out parts until you make the fig your own. So quit your dawdling and get on the bandwagon for MiniLand scale figs. And don&#39;t have all the fun as the rest of us want a little of it, too!</p>
