"Novelty","2007-08-31T05:11:47.833Z","Bull's Breath","This is a nice little cart - and it is very well equipped for such a small cart. It also functions as a siege machine with the flames coming from the front. There's handles for holding and pushing the cart, a shield to protect the card handler, and the clips for the weapons on the side so that the minifig can grab those to join the battle when the cart is no longer useful.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

It's a very simple build and it's also a good set to get if you want to build an army. I also can't complain about the design which LEGO gave to that minifig. It's a neat little set to have but I would recommend you to get the bigger models first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
