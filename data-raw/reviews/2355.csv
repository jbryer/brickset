 PROS
*nice set design, while being small.
*only 3.99!!!
*nice torso, sheild, helmet, and crossbow's!

 CONS
*one extra crossbow, so if you use it for parts you'll always have extra. However, can be perfect if you have extra minifigs.
*not much playability, it could have been better if it came with a bull.

Overall Playability: 6/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"omgbrick","2007-12-21T16:27:35.92Z","Castle Army builder","This was the smallest set in the Knights Kingdom but itâ€™s still very useful because of the minifig.
This small set was around 2 dollars. I found a large bin of these and some snow scooters so I bought 1. The set comes in a polybag with every thing inside of it. The instruction manual is just 1 piece of paper folded up. The build is simple just a minifig with a little turret. The main attraction for this set is the fully armed minifig. He has legs with some metal armor printed on them a good torso quiver and a helmet. As for armaments he can use one of the crossbows on the side of the turret and use a shield for defense.
Over all this is a nice archer army builder and I suggest getting 1 or more. 5/5

"Novelty","2007-08-29T10:04:23.067Z","Cross - Off","This set contains of a structure with two crossbows and a shield attached, built atop a turntable thing and manned by a minifig.  There's almost no building to this set and the only movable part outside of the minifig is the turn-table.  Nevertheless it has some nice design points - the quiver on the back of the minifig for the crossbow and the lion shield in front protecting the minifig.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-10T02:20:23.717Z","Great set - Great Price","I have had this set since it came out and after reading other reviews, I double checked and when I got this one retail at the time was only 1.99 !! Now that value, cross bows are cool, mini figure has quiver and the weapon roatates. Great set at a great price.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Being an AFOL I am still hoping to one day actually own a large castle set or five to build a great display. But for now I can settle with the cheaper alternatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set #4811 Defense Archer was a set from the first era of Knight's Kingdom (And the only one I have representing this era of the Castle theme.) it was released not only as a polybag set, but a boxed version as well. I only ever saw the polybag version and picked it up one day during grocery shopping on impulse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's very little here in this set, you're given a small amount of pieces, less than fifteen I believe and you build up a small medieval style turret weapon to defend your castles with.</p>
<p>It takes less than a minute to build, but it offers up tons of play options even with a limited number of Castle sets in your possession.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure is one I find to be quite enjoyable as far as knight's go. He's the only one I have so far with that particular style of helmet (I'll be perfectly honest I'm not sure what the different styles are called.) and he has a nice printing for his uniform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lacking accessories isn't that big of a deal for this guy, he get's to stand at a stationary double-crossbow defense platform and rain arrows down on the enemy storming the castle. As a plus you can remove one crossbow and the sheild included with him so he can leave the tiny defense platform and join the rest of the knights leaving for battle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really what more can I say about this set that others haven't mentioned before me? Overall I give it a four rating with five for playability (the possibilities are endless.) If you can find one for cheap on e-bay I'd say snatch it up, especially if it's in a lot or something. Having more than one also helps troop build your LEGO Knights.</p>",TRUE,4,3,2,5,3
