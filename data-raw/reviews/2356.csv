"Novelty","2007-08-31T06:01:53.503Z","One-armed Destroyer","This is one of the 4 shiny chrome sets from the 2000 Knight's Kingdom line - where in each set there was one piece that was coated in a shiny layer of chrome.  This set contains a catapault on wheels, a soldier and a knight with a shiny chrome sword.  The design and build of the catapault is interesting, with the flag in front and the embellishments and the mini-tower complete with the flag.  However there are two flaws with this catapault.  The first is that it lacks attachments for it to be horse/dragon drawn or to be pushed/pulled manually.  The second, and the more serious one, is that the design of the &quot;pressing&quot; end of the catapault is too short, and it is thus very difficult to work the catapault.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

It was not even disclosed in the magazine you got the suprise once it arrived. That alone is enough to try to obtain this set. The catapult works well enough and you get another good knight for your battles in Knights Kingdom. Overall a must for a serious collector (the Princess)!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-24T17:03:23.153Z","Very Cool!","This is a set from the knights kingdom subtheme (don't knights' kingdom theme from 2004), and this isn't a small set, or a big sized, but a special one with chromed pieces. To this set don't be expensive were putted one shiny p&#237;ece, the sword. One of the most cool swords in the history of lego castle, is one of the greater in playability. The minifigures are a knight and an archer with a crossbow. The designs are simple but cool, like the armors printed on the body or the helmets. These minifigures are from the army of the knights of king leo, with a lion symbol. The colors of the knight, black and red, don't looks like much with the symbol and the shield, but still useful for any army(more the olders, with don't limited color scheme). The catapult have wheels of carts, not the best, but good for keep a price don't very expensive. The flags were very included in many colors on previous sets, this have a blue one to looks like with the colors of the catapult. The building of little tower separates the flag of the shooter part of the catapult, this can shoots more than pile like pieces, and works well. To play with is easy, but isn't great for put minifigures on it, only makes the catapult runs with a shield in the front. Ramp pieces were placed at the two sides of the catapult, in the left, to keep the catapult don't falling and  don't dismantling. The pieces are useful, the colors to the knights kingdom or knights' kingdom subtheme/theme, or in any of the olds, that were very colorful. The building is easy, and when completed, is easy to play with, being recommended too for childrens, because the catapult works very well. Anyone can launch the pieces with this catapult, and due the playability, building, contents and features(like the sword), this deserves a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-26T10:49:07.127Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - Knights' Catapult Review","This set is a small but it's great for army building. It has a nice catapult with a great looking shovel which can shoot the rocks on the bad guys. There're no more play features but it's still a great little set. I also like the minifigs we get in this set. This set is the cheapest way to get a female knight minifig from the LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom) theme and we also get a piece which you can use to build a silver knight.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
