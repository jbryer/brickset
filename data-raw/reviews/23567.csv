<p>It is a Polybag... no need to explain it more</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good pieces... but I have a comment to write later on here</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Awesome Minifigure for the EU</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy to build since it is a Minifigure</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly... it is a great figure and all, just wish that the other side of the head was his true face before he became a Sith Lord.&nbsp; There isn&#39;t much to say about the figure.&nbsp; It should also have a small biography so that people can understand who Darth Revan was and that he is from KOTOR (Knights of the Old Republic) [or even a link online or something]</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2014-07-27T23:18:10.05Z","A decent figure","<p>When I saw this minifigure available&nbsp;from the LEGO Store, I decided to make an order - making a Star Wars buy just over 400 DKK, gave me access to this now &quot;free&quot; figure and a &quot;free&quot; Star Wars poster, pretty cool. Quick delivery from the Store itself.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The set comes in a polybag&nbsp;without instructions. Neither there is any spare parts.<br />
I usually keep my LEGO boxes for collection, but since this set comes in a polybag... Well, there is no box. So I kept the bag - which has a higher quality than the standard transplanted bags in box sets.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Good parts, but again - no spare parts. Simply makes up a figure.</p>

<ul>
	<li>1x Standard lightsaber&nbsp;hilt (Chorme).</li>
	<li>1x Red transplanted lightsaber blade</li>
	<li>1x Black cape (Cloth)</li>
	<li>1x Black cape head piece</li>
	<li>And printed legs, torso and head - exclusive to this set.</li>
</ul>

<p>The legs are printed on half&nbsp;the front surface. The torso only contains front printing&nbsp;and the head piece is single printed (No double face).</p>

<p>Note that the clothed cape is not safety packed, the polybag&nbsp;contains nothing more than the parts.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>... Well...</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Short, simple and easy. Hard to fail.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>A unique figure for now; looks cool - great for display alone and for the collection.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Totally worth the price (&quot;free&quot;), get it while you can.<br />
Awesome figure for any Star Wars collection.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-05-20T20:56:18.59Z","A new Sith from Expanded Universe.","<p><strong>Set #5002123 Darth Revan:</strong> This character is a fan favorite, I know absolutely nothing about his back story or his contribution to the Star Wars Lore/Mythos, what I do know is he&#39;s highly desirable and this Minifigure is relatively impressive for a free giveaway item.</p>

<p>Revan features a single-sided torso print showcasing his armoured outfit quite nicely. The legs feature limited printing bringing the detail from the torso down into the legs with his sash and other elements of the protective body armour he wears. He has nice dark-red hands, which is a rare colour for Minifigure hands, a pearl silver hilt and a red lightsaber blade.</p>

<p>The head printing gives us a look at the mask he wears, which is somewhat similar to Kylo Ren&#39;s mask design and is printed on a darkish grey head, he includes the old style black cape and hood piece to round out his appearance.</p>

<p>Overall, this character means very little to me. I&#39;m not aware of him as well as I should be, however to receive one for free in LEGO form is greatly appreciated and I&#39;d recommend this item for the sake of variety in the Star Wars collection and fans of Star Wars Minifigures. His black and red colour scheme is extremely impressive as well and looks sharp.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2016-10-15T21:59:49.557Z","Dark Lord of the Sith; Servant of the Light","<p>Darth&nbsp;Revan. The name has been legendary among Star Wars fans since <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>(KOTOR)&nbsp;was released over a decade ago. The game was praised for its great story, and Revan was the key character in the game. The plot gave the player the opportunity to chose Revan&#39;s destiny, either to redeem himself and return to the light; or to reclaim his title of Dark Lord of the Sith. This plurality has helped cement the character&#39;s popularity, as he is one of a few Star Wars characters to tread the path between light and dark.</p>

<p>As a kid I played <em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>, and with our&nbsp;Lego sets a friend and I recreated Revan and several other characters in the game to play out adventures with when we visited each other. Revan&nbsp;is an iconic character, that has stuck with me through out the years. I still fire up my old Xbox disc of <em>Knights of the Old Republic </em>from time to time, and dive back into its great story.</p>

<p>When Revan&nbsp;was first released in 2014, I was out of my home country; and missed out on him completely. The scalpers on Bricklink and Ebay had such high prices I doubted I would ever be able to get the figure.&nbsp;I was thus, very happy to hear he would be released for Force Friday in 2016! After purchasing a Star Wars set at 10:00 pm Mountain Standard Time the Thursday night before Force Friday, I was able to qualify to receive Revan with the purchase. A week later, the package arrived at my door.</p>

<p>The polybag is a simple design. No instructions were included, although building a minifigure should be a straight forward process for any Lego fan. To my chagrin, I realized all the parts for this figure have been made in China; meaning they aren&#39;t completely to par to the Lego parts manufactured in Denmark or Mexico. However, China&#39;s Lego production has improved drastically over the years, and a close inspection revealed that the quality of Revan was high enough that only a thorough inspection revealed any imperfection. I am ultimately satisfied with the quality of the figure.</p>

<p>The torso, leg, and head pieces are all exclusive to Darth Revan.The head print represents the Mandalorian mask he wore as a Sith lord, and the mask he can claim again at the end of the game if the player decides to take Revan down the path of the dark side. The torso only had front printing, but this is not an issue due to the cape covering his back. The torso and hip prints aligned nicely, and helped complete the look of the figure. His lightsaber hilt had a nice sheen to it, although not nearly as shiny as the chrome lightsabers&nbsp;that were retired many years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only complaint is that his cape is the old style cape, and is not very flexible. This could be easily rectified, but since I am planning to keep my Revan for display and light play purposes, I will let him keep his original cape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am highly satisfied with this figure. I hope those that missed its release will be able to get another chance to get it from Lego. I am happy to have it in hand, and feel like a long lasting desire to finally own a piece of KOTOR in Lego form has finally been satisfied.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A polybag with no instructions.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Great parts, including the head with mask print and torso. &nbsp;These are incredibly detailed and highly resemble the original character.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The only thing in the set is Revan himself. Like I said above, he looks extremely accurate.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a minifigure, so not challenging at all. The only trouble I had was trying to figure out how to pose the lightsaber to fit in my Character Building display case.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>See above.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great minifig, I highly recommend it!</p>

"DarthRevan01","2020-10-05T20:33:37.153Z","My favorite minifigure of all time","<p>In my opinion, this is one of the best Lego Minifigures of all time! The prints are great, the character from which the minifigure is based on is great! Revan is easily my favorite character&nbsp;of all time! The minifigure is great to use in MOCs and Dioramas, and I&#39;d really like to see it in a set, like a duel set between Bastila Shan, Darth Malak and Revan.</p>
