"Odeinoichus","2014-07-23T15:51:50.68Z","Eat My Shorts","<p><strong>Set #71005 Bart Simpson: </strong>Bart is a part of pop culture and is, like the rest of his family, quite iconic. This is the only licensed theme where LEGO&#39;s yellow coloured Mini-Figs makes sense.</p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">This figure is even less detailed than his father, Bart has no printing at all on the front of his torso, instead he has back printing showing off a rear pocket with slingshot that is actually printed partially on the short legs he comes with.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Accessory wise he has his distinct looking green skateboard with printed red stripe. This makes him one of the easier figures to find using the feel method. Everything about Bart is unique, he has a unique torso with the two-toned plastic arms, his short legs also have unique colours and yellow breaking up the blue of the figure&#39;s usual wardrobe (shorts and shoes). The head sculpt captures the look of the character perfectly and his unique to him.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Overall this, like the rest of the Theme, is something I find myself really liking and highly recommending for the unique nature of the character selection and the new methods and colours of plastics being used to capture the animation likenesses. However I am aware that some people just won&#39;t want them in their collection, they aren&#39;t for everybody, they are still quite good though I do think Bart suffers the most when it comes to accessories as the skateboard isn&#39;t all that impressive or unique compared to the rest of his family members.</font></p>

Not only did it raise in price from $2.99 to $3.99, but the idea of using an adult cartoon as a minifigure theme was certainly not welcomed. The series sold very well, however, and it was a much, much, MUCH cheaper way to obtain the whole Simpson family.</p>

<p>Bart Simpson has a specialised head sculpt that was made for this character, however it was not new to this series, since it was incorporated in the house set as well. This version of Bart did have new printing, however. Though they were pretty unpopular back then, I love the use of moulded heads within this series, as it definitely makes it feel worth the $4 dollar price tag.</p>

<p>Though this was the first CMF series to include them, Bart&#39;s dual-moulded arms aren&#39;t exclusive, as they were included with the Simpsons House set. They still look fantastic here, and once again, this was a much cheaper way to obtain them. Now, his use of red for the torso has always been a bit controversial, since Bart from the TV show had a bit of an orange-red tone. Orange was included with the Simpsons Series 2 Bart, but here, it uses red, like the house set. The use of red really works for me personally, but I can admit that it isn&#39;t entirely screen-accurate. This figure&#39;s torso is actually exclusive, however, thanks to his back printing, which depicts his sling shot. It&#39;s a really advanced print, but what impresses me even more is how it carries onto the back of the legs, as well.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, his short legs are tri-moulded in light blue and yellow. The tri-mould effect was not new for this figure, however it is exclusive, thanks to the continued sling-shot printing&nbsp;at&nbsp;the back. Back leg printing is something I&#39;m not sure we&#39;ve ever even got since, so it was super advanced for the time.</p>

<p>As far as accessories go, Bart only includes one, however it is a good inclusion. His skateboard was also included in the house set, but that variant used stickers, while this uses red prints. The use of purple for the wheels is a very interesting and obscure colour for those pieces, and overall, I am satisfied with that skateboard.</p>

<p>Overall, though this isn&#39;t the most exclusive figure thanks to the house set, this is an absolutely fantastic inclusion, since said house set is a little more expensive than this. Just kidding, it&#39;s a LOT more expensive, so this is an absolutely fantastic way to get the character. This is an easy 5 out of 5 figure for me!</p>
