I may one day get the house, though I&#39;m not sure on that, however I will maintain that despite the controversy among LEGO&#39;s fanbase this series is definitely impressive. Now on to the brief review.</p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">I have found that this series has the least amount of printed detailing, they are all rather simple prints for the torsos and few if any have leg prints. This is because the Mini-Figures are meant to capture the look of the very simple animation designs from the show.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Each of them also has a uniquely crafted new head piece capturing the particular character&#39;s likeness quite nicely. Homer here is sporting his casual look for sitting around the house, or going off to Moe&#39;s Tavern and the like. The torso print is very simple, with just a shirt collar and a small stomach line to indicate his obese nature. His arms are cast in two separate colours, white for the upper arms for his shirt sleeves and yellow for his bare arms.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Homer includes two accessories, a printed television remote tile and a printed donut smooth stud, both are iconic for the character. His unique head is very impressively sculpted, it looks spot on to the animation model and is a great looking piece. Not very useful for MOCs, but still highly impressive for a LEGO Mini-Figure head.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">One final thing of note, Homer has a unique leg colour, it&#39;s a much lighter tone of blue that I believe is quite rare in LEGO as most blue legs are a more solid colour.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Overall, this Figure is definitely up to personal tastes when it comes to collecting it. Fans of unique style Mini-Figures will love all of the Simpsons line, fans of the show will also enjoy them, those interested in unique parts and accessories could find a use for many of the pieces with possible exception to the head. I would definitely recommend the figure.</font></p>

Parents were very unhappy with LEGO for releasing a minifigure series based off an adult cartoon, and branding it ages 5 and up. Another main source of controversy with this series was the raise in price from $2.99 to $3.99. Despite all that, the Simpsons Series was pretty successful. The first character in the series is Homer Simpson, who includes 6 pieces, and was released in 2014.</p>

<p>On top of the raise in price and adult theming, this series was controversial for its use of moulded heads. It might seem like a silly complaint nowadays, but in 2014, fans were used to normal, round minifigure head pieces, so the use of specialised heads was somewhat unpopular. However, after LEGO released their short film on YouTube based off the Simpsons, which used normal head parts, most fans instantly favoured these. I, on the other hand, love the moulded heads, and I think they look incredibly detailed. Homer&#39;s head piece was not new for the figure, since it did come in the Simpsons House set a few months earlier. This piece did not stay exclusive, but its introduction here is superb! The huge, bug eyes are accurate, and the quality of printing regarding the brown mouth is excellent. Black hair is printed around the rim, as well as at the top of his rounded head, and that all comes out looking excellent.</p>

<p>This CMF&#39;s torso has some printing that was introduced with this series. It&#39;s really accurate to the show, but some LEGO fans complain about the rump in his stomach being printed, as it lacks 3 dimensions. I can see where they&#39;re coming from, but it doesn&#39;t personally bother me. The lack of back printing doesn&#39;t bug me with this character particularly, since this character isn&#39;t overly detailed in the cartoon. Now, this series had a lot of interesting qualities, as previously discussed, but another new feature to add to this series is its introduction of dual-moulded arms! I&#39;m surprised to see them introduced in a series that&#39;s already so heavy on new moulds, but that might explain the jump from 3 dollars to 4. Anyway, dual-moulded arms are incredible to get in CMF&#39;s, and casting them in white and yellow makes it useful outside the setting for generic civilian minifigures.</p>

<p>The legs have no printing, but I think they might&#39;ve been new for the series in that colour. They are the literal perfect tone, and they match wonderfully with Homer Simpson from the TV show. Moving on, his accessories are the best possible inclusions, them being his iconic donut, and a remote control. The remote is printed on 1x2 dark grey tile, and all te individual buttons are super simple, but so effective. The dounut (or doughnut,) does look slightly odd with a flat centre, but I can totally excuse that. Including three new designs with a 4 dollar figure would be a lot for LEGO to tackle. Either way, that donut has been used many times since, and it really is a fantastic print.</p>

<p>Overall, despite the price jump from 3 bucks to 4, this is a fantastic figure, and a much, much, MUCH cheaper alternative to the Simpson&#39;s House set. The included head-mould is brilliant, but the brand new dual-moulded arms introduced with this series are brilliant! Overall, this is an easy 5 out of 5 figure for me, and that&#39;s a sign of a great figure, considering I haven&#39;t even seen the show.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
