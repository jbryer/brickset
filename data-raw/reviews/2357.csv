"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-03T22:08:19Z","Good for pieces","...it has some good castle building pieces. The breastplate is the most common of the silver pieces that the different sets (apart from the sword). It has a treasure chest and some battlements. Good for expanding King Leo's Castle.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-10T02:33:06.327Z","Ladder-Silver Breastplate-Skeleton-Treasure Chest","This if memory serves was a S&amp;H exclusive. I like all the pieces in this set, especially the grey castle piece which can expand other sets. You get alot for the money in this very useful set, if you come across it purchase it you will like it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-31T05:57:07.957Z","Skeletal Tower","This is one of the 4 shiny chrome sets from the 2000 Knight's Kingdom line - where in each set there was one piece that was coated in a shiny layer of chrome.  This is the only set of the 4 that has a building, although it is not much of a building.  It also comes with a skeleton that has a helmet, a treasure chest full of jewels and a soldier with a chrome breastplate.  There's not much building involved, although there are some nice design touches including the multicoloured gems in the treasure chest, the helmeted skeleton and the flag atop the &quot;tower&quot;.  The tower itself seems too much as a facade, and the flames atop it just looks out of place hanging off the side.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-03T13:20:07.873Z","another good small set","This set is one of the small sets released in 2000, from the castle theme and knights kingdom subtheme. The building is easy (of course, because this is a small set, so, it have no much building envolved) but the color scheme and design still nice. The two minifigures included, a knight and a skeleton, are simple but good designed, altough features no much new things. The knight is different from some others, have a helmet in classic style, a great axe, a shield and an silver armor, that makes it better. The skeleton is just like the others, but have a helmet. The few building involved is a little scenery, a tower bulted above a green little plate. The tower is good builted altough simple, it also have builted a flag, a stair and some torchs. The set also includes some coloured pieces in a treasure chest. Altough the set have no much building, this is a small set that had a cheap price and features like all the other sets, some useful pieces, to increase and build your creations.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-26T10:54:58.9Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - Dunegon Review","This is a very simple set of the LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom) theme. There's just one small tower with a treasure chest in it and the only play feature you get here is that the ladder can be moved up and down. We also get two minifigs in this set. One of them is another skeleton figure and the other one is a knight figure which has a silver armor which you can use to build a silver knight. It's a good set for little money but I think you should buy the bigger ones first before you get this model.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
