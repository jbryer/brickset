<p><font face=""Courier New"">Marge is the Matriarch of the Simpson family, she&#39;s also one of the few Mini-Figs in the set with more than simple printing, her torso is double sided showing off the pearl necklace she&#39;s famous for and the upper portions of her customary green dress.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">For accessories she has a pink purse and a printed tile with the magazine Donut Fancy printed on it, something perhaps Homer would find more appealing. She also has the half-skirt accessory to represent the bottom of her dress, meaning that her legs are rather plain looking solid yellow plastic with a lime green waist piece, making the figure look extremely odd if the dress piece isn&#39;t on.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Her head is uniquely her own, it would never work for much MOC figures, and it is easy to feel for in the pack. Strangely enough it actually has a hole in the top for typical hair accessories, if you have any Friends set with hair bows you can see what she&#39;d look like wearing one.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Overall I think Marge is a decent looking figure, once again with some unique colours, her torso is actually quite good for MOC figures, if you wanted to collect more for mini-figs parts. I recommend the Simpsons series in it&#39;s entirety if you really enjoy the characters, if you aren&#39;t a fan you may want to use some of the pieces for parts, the only problem is that the heads don&#39;t really serve much purpose outside of the Theme.</font></p>

Though the whole family was included in 71006, this minifigure series provides exclusive variations of the characters, with new printing. Thus is the case with Marge, who includes 8 pieces, and was part of the first CMF series to cost $3.99.</p>

<p>Her head sculpt is brilliant, and maybe the most detailed piece of the whole series. The intricate bulbs for the hair are so detailed, as is the slight curving of the entire assembly. The large, white eyes made this an exclusive print for the time, though it was later reused in the Kwik E Mart set. The blue and yellow combination is appealing to look at, but the unique moulded heads in this series were somewhat controversial when this line launched.</p>

<p>The torso was made specifically for this figure, but it, like the head, was later reused in the Kwik E Mart set. That&#39;s a little unfortunate, since it takes the uniqueness and exclusivity out of this design, but that isn&#39;t a problem with this figure, that&#39;s an issue with the aforementioned Kwik E Mart set. Anyway, the printed detailing is not bad whatsoever. I love the iconic red necklace, and this figure has some impressive back printing, which wasn&#39;t super common in 2014 CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>While difficult to attach, I&#39;ve always preferred the use of cloth skirts over printed ones. Printed skirts feel a little shallow, so getting it as a genuine piece is appreciated, at least by me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legs lack printing, but that&#39;s not a problem, since she has that cloth skirt. As far as accessories go, she includes two, and I appreciate the inclusion of dual-pieces. She includes a small, pink purse, which is a fantastic accessory, but my personal favourite of the two has to be her 2x2 tile with &quot;DONUT FANCY&quot; printing.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an excellent alternative to obtaining this character to the expensive Simpsons House set. Heck, this version is better, since it represents her on-screen outfit a lot better. She&#39;s an easy 5 out of 5 for me!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
