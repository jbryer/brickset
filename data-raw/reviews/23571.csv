<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The lisa i got was in a pack. Which is frustrating if you just pick blindly. There are a few key things to feel for when getting these single packs. There are plenty of guides to help you identify who you want in these blind picks. But the pack has a great design and come with a generic minifig chart and directions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lisas&nbsp;head is the star of this fig. I love these new heads. So detailed. She comes with the child legs (not posible) her skirt and her sax which is killer. Really cool when set up.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Lisa simpson. Duh. The reviews on her.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>its a two second build. The skirt is kind of a pain to get right but not impossible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Comes with a stand as all the figs do. Great for display and play.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you like the simpsons its a no brainer. Get it. Happy hunting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lisa is also a more detailed looking Mini-Figure when it comes to printing, much like her mother she has a double-sided torso with her dress and necklace printed on it. She has the shorter legs, similar to her brother with half red and half yellow colours and a small skirt piece to finish off her iconic dress&#39;s look.</p>

<p>Her head, like with all the Simpsons series is unique and a brand new piece, she also comes with the saxophone accessory which is nice to see in use again. I think Lisa suffers from a few issues though, her accessory is very iconic, it&#39;s her personal instrument after all. However it may have been nice to see her with a picture of bleeding gums murphy, or a printed tile with her doll design mint in the box just to give her more accessories. Also I find her shorter legs make the cloth skirt piece look terribly bunched up and too thick, she&#39;s one of the first short legged mini-figures to include this particular piece and I can see why other short legged LEGO figs don&#39;t use it.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d still recommend this to fans of the Theme, and the pieces are useful aside from the head if you like using unique prints for custom Mini-Figs. I just feel that she is a bit weaker from the set due to the limited number of accessories. Something many of the kids from Springfield have problems with because of the nature of this theme. I do still like the saxophone, I just kind of wish she had something extra.</p>

This was the first series to retail for $3.99, however, which was somewhat controversial.</p>

<p>Another element of this series that caused controversy was the use of moulded heads. I personally love moulded heads used in LEGO minifigures, so obviously, I love Lisa Simpson&#39;s head sculpt. The intricately moulded spiky hair at the back is superb, as are the big, printed eyes. This head sculpt, with this arrangement of printing, actually stayed exclusive to this figure, believe it or not.</p>

<p>Something that wasn&#39;t exclusive, however, was the torso, as it was the exact same piece used in 71006. I don&#39;t hate its usage here, as this is a much cheaper way to obtain it. Lisa has back printing that looks nearly identical to the front, and if it weren&#39;t for the arms, I would never know the difference between the back and the front.</p>

<p>Identical to the sets once again, she uses a cloth skirt piece that does have a nice, triangular pattern at the bottom. I prefer cloth skirts over shallow, printed ones.</p>

<p>The legs are, once again, the same as the legs found in 71006, if I&#39;m not mistaking. I adore tri-moulded small legs, so their inclusion here is absolutely appreciated.</p>

<p>Accessory-wise, she includes a saxophone. That piece wasn&#39;t new for the series, as it&#39;s a reuse of the Series 11 Saxophone Player&#39;s accessory. Its inclusion here is, obviously, fitting.</p>

<p>Overall, I like Lisa a little less than the rest of her family, since almost all her parts, minus the head, were not exclusive. I&#39;m still gonna give her a 4, however, since this is a cheap alternative to obtaining the character.</p>
