<p><font face=""Courier New"">Maggie is using a brand new torso, a single solid piece with no separate legs, it&#39;s a baby jumper. This limits her poseability considerably, but is very cute and captures the likeness of the character quite nicely, unfortunately I don&#39;t see much use for this expensive new sculpt, or what I assume would be an expensive new sculpt. With possible exception to further Simpsons baby mini-figs this new piece won&#39;t be used often outside of the Theme, unless LEGO wants to make an infant ghost figure or something.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Her head is as always unique to her character and her accessory is Bobo the stuffed teddy, a very appropriate accessory for her and really the only one she&#39;d even come with as I don&#39;t recall her having much else that she could use as an accessory.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Overall this Mini-Figure is a must own to complete the family from the blind bag series, and I strongly recommend at least trying to get the entire family if you don&#39;t like the Theme enough to collect the figures. I&#39;m afraid her parts aren&#39;t too useful for MOCs though if you are trying to get unique parts for mini-figures.</font></p>

She includes only 4 pieces, which is less than the normal piece count for CMF&#39;s. Maggie was part of the first series to retail for $3.99.</p>

<p>The head piece was made specifically for this character, but not specifically for this series. The first appearance of that head was in 71006, however the printing here is exclusive. Speaking of which, I like the squinty eyes, and her red binky is adorable, as is her small bow. Maggie is an adorable character, and this head sculpt indefinitely captures that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The torso mould is certainly interesting, however it wasn&#39;t made exclusively for this series. It was first introduced in 71006, and it was later used in Simpsons Series 2. I love that mould, as it makes her appropriately shorter than her siblings, Bart and Lisa. It&#39;s caste in an accurate light blue tone.</p>

<p>Her accessory, besides the head, is the only exclusive part of the figure. That piece honestly looks a little spooky, but nonetheless, it&#39;s accurate to the show.</p>

<p>Overall, Maggie does look a little too similar to the one found in 71006, but this is obviously a much, much, MUCH cheaper way to obtain her. I&#39;m gonna give her a 4 because of that, but I do kind of wish she was more exclusive.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
