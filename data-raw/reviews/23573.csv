<p><font face=""Courier New"">Grandpa aka Abraham Simpson is another simple printed Mini-Fig, he only has a small bit of print on his torso for his collar. Something I neglected to mention is that aside from the animation models having simple details I assume there are less prints on this series because the unique head sculpts all have highly detailed print work for the eyes and other unique facial traits.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">His accessory is a printed tile with the Springfield shopper printed on it and Old Man Yells At Cloud. Another nod to one of the many episodes seen in the series, though I don&#39;t remember which one, so many to keep track of sometimes I forget certain details.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Overall while Grandpa isn&#39;t exactly the most detailed figure, he does have some good traits. His torso and legs are unique and great for MOC enthusiasts, the accessory is a fun little nod to the show and the head is greatly detailed with another unique sculpt. I look forward to seeing if this Theme will feature more sets in the future and recommend snatching up what you can as the Theme is surprisingly popular despite the huge controversy and has sold out this series quite rapidly.</font></p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-10T16:34:08.53Z","exclusive HEAD MOULD!","<p>All 5 members of the Simpsons family is included in the Simpsons series, but another member of the extended family is incorporated as well, that being Grampa Simpson. This character was released in 2014, where it was part of the first ever series to cost $3.99.</p>

<p>Grampa&#39;s head sculpt was made exclusively for this figure, and it was never used outside the series. The sculpt work surrounding that head is detailed, and not only is the printing atop the head superb, but he has a surprisingly lot of printing for the white eyes, and brown beard. I like how the mould resembles Homer, which is accurate to the show.</p>

<p>Abe&#39;s torso doesn&#39;t have a lot of detail, but honestly, he doesn&#39;t need it. The detail incorporated is accurate to the show, and honestly, if it was overcrowded with detail it could ruin this figure&#39;s aesthetic. Abe has no back printing.</p>

<p>The legs have no printing, so we&#39;re gonna move onto his accessory, which isn&#39;t very usable, but it is pretty fantastic. Disclaimer, I have never seen a single episode of The Simpsons, but I know some iconic bits and pieces from the show. This 2x2 tile definitely captures Abe&#39;s iconic moment of yelling at a cloud, thus, it&#39;s a very fitting accessory.</p>

<p>Overall, this series was made for characters like this, and I can&#39;t think of a better inclusion in the series. Abe has the perfect level of detailing, where it&#39;s not too much, and not too little. 5 out of 5!</p>
