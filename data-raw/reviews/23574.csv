Of course the prints are different, but at least you have all the main characters included with the house without having to pay so much.</p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Flanders is one of the many denizens of Springfield that flush out the rest of this series, which I have to say is the first series to include the most short legged characters. Flanders has a nice green torso which represents his iconic sweater, complete with a nice little collar print showing off the undershirt. Another great piece for MOC fans.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">His legs are a nice dark grey as well. Accessories include a toolbox and a coffee mug, the mug is from Flanders&#39; Leftorium store with a clever I heart South Paws print, since he is a left handed character, and his toolbox is the same found in the House set with a Property of Ned Flanders sticker printed on it. I really like these accessories for the character.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Overall once again I recommend the figure, I understand though that this Theme isn&#39;t for everybody. I do love the detailed unique head piece LEGO made for him though, that mustache and his customary thick glasses look great. It&#39;s amazing the level of detail the sculptors captured in all these figures and I really hope we see either future sets or another series of Mini-Figs to continue building up our small LEGO Springfield displays.</font></p>

I know Ned Flanders is a prominent character in the show, however, so that&#39;s good enough for me to have a place in this series. Ned was also included in 71006, however this is a new, more classic variation. This series was released in 2014, where it was the first lineup to cost $4 bucks a pop.</p>

<p>Ned&#39;s head sculpt is identical to the one in 71006, even down to printing. I don&#39;t have a problem with that, considering how expensive that set is. The detail on Ned is just as good here as it was there.</p>

<p>The torso printing is exclusive to this figure, and I like how it matches Ned&#39;s more iconic appearance from the show. The print in 71006 sported an apron, but I like this design better, despite it being light on detail. He doesn&#39;t have any back printing.</p>

<p>Ned&#39;s legs are plain dark grey without printing, but his accessories are the opposite! They&#39;re packed with detail, which is something I definitely welcome. His toolbox says &quot;Property of Ned Flanders,&quot; while his white coffee cup says &quot;I luv South Paws.&quot; I&#39;m sure fans of the show would love those parts, but I haven&#39;t seen a single Simpsons episode. They&#39;re still good inclusions.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice variation and alternative to Ned from 71006, so obviously this is a 5!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
