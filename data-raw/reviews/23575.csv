<p><font face=""Courier New"">Krusty has a very unique head, the most obvious when trying to feel for him next to Marge. He&#39;s also very limited in print detail on his torso with his shirt&#39;s collar and little bow tie, plus again the small stomach line to indicate his paunchy stomach.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Accessories are limited to the pie piece, it&#39;s a great piece, and suits the character as well as anything else considering LEGO would never have given him a liquor bottle or something more raunchy where this character is concerned. Although I kind of wish he had a Krusty Burger package or something, since that would have been a nice accessory to include.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Courier New"">Overall I think Krusty is a great figure due to his unique parts, the legs are a lime green colour and a pink torso with two-toned arms. The pink upper arms with yellow lower arms, great for MOC figures. His head looks great too and he is one of the more famous characters from Springfield. Strongly recommend him.</font></p>

But perhaps the strangest CMF clown is Krusty the Clown from the 2014 Simpsons series. He includes 5 pieces, and was part of the first series to cost $3.99.</p>

<p>Obviously, my favourite part of this figure is his head sculpt, which is insanely detailed and intricate. It has a HUGE palette of colours, including white eyes, a red nose, yellow head, white teeth, tan mouth, and blue-green, bubbly hair. Speaking of which, his hair is insanely detailed and intricate, and this whole sculpt is possibly my favourite piece of the entire series.</p>

<p>Krusty&#39;s torso has a small amount of detail on the front, but no printing at the back. It&#39;s caste in an uncommon tone of pink, but the arms are my second favourite part of the series. Dual-moulded arms were introduced to&nbsp;the CMF line with this series, so getting them here is brilliant. The colour combo of yellow and pink is useful with civilian CMF&#39;s, so I love getting them here.</p>

<p>The legs have no printing, but the colour used is not that&nbsp;common. Krusty&#39;s accessory is a pie, perhaps lemon meringue, and I believe this was exclusive to the figure, thanks to the colours used.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#39;t know jack crap about Simpsons, but I know this figure is fantastic. Not only is the head piece amazing, but his dual-moulded arms and colour used are uncommon. 5 out of 5!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
