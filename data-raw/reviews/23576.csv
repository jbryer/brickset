Here, not only do you have a popular character from the best cartoon series of all time, you also have one of the master builders from The LEGO Movie.</p>

<p>The blind bag is hard to open without scissors but once you use some to open it, it&#39;s fairly straightforward. Instructions are unnecessary for this but there are some anyway, which I suppose is helpful if you have the intelligence of Homer Simpson. In that scenario, I imagine they would be helpful and explain how to build the minifigure&nbsp;in a easy-to-understand way.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are fantastic. It&#39;s a great likeness for Milhouse, due to the inspired idea to have specially moulded&nbsp;pieces for the Simpsons minifigures. The accessory is a great reference to a funny sight gag related to the lack of spectacled superheroes and Milhouse&nbsp;finding one he can relate to. It&#39;s nice that they have gone for a more obscure item rather than a obvious one.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a relatively straightforward build with only placing the comic book in his hand proving fiddly and difficult. Anyone can build this.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>LEGO Milhouse is a fantastic(if expensive) minifigure and one every Simpsons/LEGO Movie fan should own.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2014-08-14T15:08:02.977Z","Enter a Master Builder","<p><strong>Set #71005 Milhouse Van Houten: </strong>The Simpsons CMF sub-theme has the single most short legged characters ever before released and on top of that they have the most memorable LEGO characters from Springfield OHIAMAUDE for the first batch. But Milhouse has the distinct pleasure of being featured in The LEGO Movie as a Master Builder.</p>

<p>Milhouse as Mini-Figure&#39;s go doesn&#39;t have much to discuss for a review outside of that interesting fact. Aside from being a figure in The LEGO Movie he doesn&#39;t have much detail work to speak of, his torso is uniquely coloured however with a light purple tone, he has two-toned arms like many from this Theme and the short legs are also two-toned though I can&#39;t be sure if it&#39;s two separate plastics blended together.</p>

<p>He has a unique head and a 2x2 printed tile with an issue of Biclops the comic book for an accessory. There really is just not much more to talk about than that. Overall the Figure looks great, the unique sculpted head piece is distinct enough that it shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to find via the feel method and the torso and legs may interest MOC enthusiasts. I&#39;m not sure what else he could have had as an accessory, perhaps Bart&#39;s Soul paper from that one episode, especially if it was a 1x2 printed tile, it would have helped find him far easier with the feel method to include both types of tiles. Still I highly recommend this line for fans of the show, the movie and unique mini-figures in general.</p>

It was pretty controversial, for a few reasons, but fans of the show were pumped about this set of 16. The raise from 3 dollars to 4 wasn&#39;t very welcome, but the inclusion of intricate, moulded heads was probably the reason for the hike.</p>

<p>Speaking of moulded heads, Milhouse Van Houten sports a great one that combines yellow and blue in an appealing way. The ridiculous red glasses are equally fantastic, as is his bulbous nose that&#39;s accurate to the show.</p>

<p>My favourite part of the figure is undoubtedly his torso and arms. The lilac torso is gorgeous and super useful outside the setting, and the dual-moulded lilac and yellow arms were not only new to the figure, but they&#39;re extremely useful for generic LEGO figures.</p>

<p>Milhouse&#39;s short legs are tri-moulded in dark-red and yellow, and I always love getting detailed short legs.</p>

<p>Milhouse&#39;s only accessory is a 2x2 tile of a biclops comic. Again, I don&#39;t understand its significance, but I&#39;m sure fans of the show dig it.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great figure not only for its intricate head, but for its pretty torso and arm colour. I&#39;m gonna rate him a 4 out of 5!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
