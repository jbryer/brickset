As a Mini-Figure his look is distinct and he&#39;s got some interesting pieces. Though not much else to discuss.</p>

<p>As one of the short-legged characters in the Theme he includes short light brown legs and a striking blue torso with&nbsp;a single sided print for his customary shirt. The unique head is actually bald, instead of sculpting hair onto him it&#39;s all printed, scraggily looking black hair. And his expression is suitably Ralph. He includes a printed 2x2 tile with the infamous valentine from the classic episode... Er, whatever it was called, I don&#39;t recall titles just situations.</p>

<p>Overall I find Ralph to be quite a fun addition to the cast of Springfield in LEGO form, I really hope this doesn&#39;t become a one-off Theme like the old Avatar the Last Airbender (who only had two sets made for it) I&#39;d love to see Troy McClure and other famous characters appear in future sets or CMF Series. Ralph is another great Mini-Figure and I rate it accordingly, plus recommend him for fans of the show.</p>

<p>Ralph Wiggum&#39;s head piece was new for the series and is exclusive to this figure to this day. I love that it&#39;s a new sculpt, but it just does not look good. If you&#39;ve seen this character&#39;s physical appearance from the cartoon, this head appears too small, and those soulless white eyes appear super creepy. The hair printed around the rim is appreciated, but I don&#39;t know: something about that piece doesn&#39;t do it for me.</p>

<p>Ralph&#39;s torso has the same issue as the head, where it just doesn&#39;t match the character&#39;s on-screen appearance. Homer Simpson has the same issue, but for some reason it isn&#39;t as big of a blaring issue with him as it is here. Ralph has no back printing.</p>

<p>His legs, while they are caste in a very appealing nougat tone, have no other detail. This 2x2 tile is certainly appreciated, however, though I don&#39;t understand it since I haven&#39;t watched the show. I&#39;m sure fans of the cartoon will like this, however.</p>

<p>Overall, I appreciate the new head sculpt, but something about Ralph doesn&#39;t exactly cut it for me. It just doesn&#39;t match the on-screen character as much as I would&#39;ve liked. I&#39;m still gonna give him a 3 out of 5 since he is a good inclusion.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
