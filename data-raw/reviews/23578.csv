"Odeinoichus","2014-08-14T15:30:05.15Z","Thank You, Come Again","<p><strong>Set #71005 Apu Nahasapeemapetilon:</strong> There are two reasons I dread seeing his character here, first it may mean we won&#39;t see a Quick-E-Mart set in the future if the Theme continues, second it means having to spell out that impossibly long name.</p>

<p>Apu is awesome good fun as a mini-figure. He&#39;s got some nice light tan legs, a dark green torso with printed chest bearing shirt, revealing his curly chest hair, actually this is one of the first mini-figures to feature that detail in printed form if I&#39;m very much not mistaken. And his head is once again nicely sculpted perfectly capturing the look of the animation model. He also has one of the most unique accessories, a squishee cup, first seen with Larry the Barrista over in the TLM Sub-Theme. (Albeit with a different print)</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d have to say this is a great addition to the Theme and his accessory is so impressive I can see a lot of collectors buying multiples for that cup alone. Unfortunately if they ever make a Quick-E-Mart set that means they&#39;d either be using the exact same torso/leg combination or giving us a different version of Apu. Personally I&#39;d take the Bowling Pin Outfit on him for that set if it ever get&#39;s made. I recommend tracking him down if these are still being sold in your area and you haven&#39;t found him yet, just feel out that unique cup and bob&#39;s your uncle. And as his catch phrase goes, Thank you, come again.</p>

Apu is one of those characters, as he was included in the Kwik E Mart set, though that was released a yet later. This series was the first time we got this character, and he&#39;s a welcome inclusion, since he was a fairly prominent fella in the cartoon. Apu was part of the first series to cost $3.99. I don&#39;t know anything about The Simpsons, but from my understanding, this character has been permanently removed from the show due to what people say was a &quot;racist stereotype.&quot; I&#39;m shocked LEGO even included him in this series because of that, but fans would&#39;ve more than likely lost their minds if he wasn&#39;t incorporated.</p>

<p>His head sculpt was new for the figure, but it didn&#39;t stay exclusive. It was directly reprinted for 71016, and while I wish that set woul&#39;ve provided some sort of exclusivity, this is a fitting print that captures the character.</p>

<p>Apu&#39;s torso is exclusive, and very much appreciated. It isn&#39;t very useful outside the setting, but I don&#39;t expect it to be, since it was made for this particular character. He has no back detailing.</p>

<p>His legs have no printing, so let&#39;s talk about his accessory, which is easily my favourite part about the figure. The white lid atop is brilliant, but the green tone used is not the most common shade of green in LEGO.</p>

<p>Overall, some people might be offended Apu was included in this series. I totally understand their frustration, and I&#39;m not condemning anyone for saying that, but as far as this minifigure goes, I like it. The new cup mould is brilliant! 4 out of 5 points on this one.</p>
