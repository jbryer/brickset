"Odeinoichus","2014-08-14T15:46:44.957Z","HA HA!","<p><strong>Set #71005 Nelson Muntz: </strong>Resident town bully found in LEGO Springfield, beware this dangerous fugitive who is armed and mischievous.</p>

<p>Nelson is a great looking figure, once again with the short legs in two tones, LEGO Mini-Fig yellow and a vibrant looking blue colour. His torso is a lighter shade of blue with orange shirt print, the outfit Nelson wears pretty much every day of his life. The head sculpt looks brilliant, it matches the animation model perfectly and gives him teeth visible from his upper lip, yes this means he is one of a very elite few Mini-Figures with teeth. He also comes with a baseball bat accessory, other than that nothing much else to point out.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend this mini-figure to everybody, it looks great, has some awesome parts for MOCing new characters and the head sculpt is gorgeous. The level of detail LEGO puts into each of these unique heads makes for some great display pieces. Definitely can&#39;t wait to see if 2015 will continue to include some awesome Simpsons characters to add to the collection.</p>

Nelson Muntz definitely looks off. He was released in 2014, includes 5 pieces, and was part of the first series to retail for $3.99.</p>

<p>Nelson&#39;s head sculpt was new for the figure, and that mould looks good. I think it does capture the character decently, thanks to the printed brown hair. I like hiw white teeth showing as well.</p>

<p>The problem with this character comes with the torso and legs. In the show, Nelson is a hulking brute who loves to pick on Bart and Milhouse. But in this series, he&#39;s the same height as them! I understand mid-legs wouldn&#39;t be introduced for another 4 years, but I would have just scrapped this design&nbsp;altogether, despite him being a prominent character in the show. With that being said, Nelson sports some good detail, and the dual-moulded arms, which were new for CMF&#39;s in this series, are included here, and the colour combo of tan and dark yellow makes them useful for generic LEGO figures.</p>

<p>Nelson&#39;s legs have the same moulding as Bart&#39;s, but the legs with this figure don&#39;t have a slingshot printed at the back.</p>

<p>Nelson&#39;s bat is included, and I&#39;m a little surprised at ts incorporation, since it is a little brutal. It isn&#39;t exclusive or anything, but I don&#39;t mind its inclusion.</p>

<p>Overall, this character does not translate well into LEGO if you ask me. I&#39;m only gonna give him a 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
