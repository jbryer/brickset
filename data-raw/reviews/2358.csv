"Blade","2008-01-04T20:39:37.95Z","Taming the Beast","This is a hard set to review as it contains a whole 15 pieces and consists of a mini-fig and animal but that doesn't make it automatically bad. This set is the third in the collection of the four chrome armour sets in the Knights Kingdom collection from 2000. The idea is collect all four sets (4816 - 4819)and you can create a mini-fig with all chrome armour. It looks good but I don't wish to go on about it. I think I paid about $7 AUD back then, so not too bad.

The mini-fig is one of the baddies from the bulls. He is dressed in black pants with a bulls shirt on and the cool chrome dragon rider helmet. His face is quite well done and looks generally evil or angry but not scary. He is armed with a long axe and a full size shield baring the bulls logo.

The dragon is just a normal dragon with moving tail, arms, mouth and wings. The dragon also has fire coming out of his mouth which can be removed. The fire and the wings are both fluro orange. The dragon is obviously black.

Overall this set is good but it has been done before. Obviously the helmet is what makes it different, semi-rare and collectable. I feel this set is about a 5/10, as it has nothing really to make it stand out above other sets like 6007 other than the helmet. I would recommend it if you need more dragons, like the Knights series or are after ...the precious...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This subtheme isn't the same Knights' Kingdom theme, this have too two sides, one  enemy of the other, but don't have much characteristics of the characters or action figures. This is one set after the ninja and classic castles, but still cool for a castle set. The contents are few, and the set don't have buildings, but still cool for a small set. This isn't also an army builder, but is more a pack of a knight and his dragon. The dragon isn't the best, but have the size to put a minifigure on it. The complete set looks like with a set from the fright knights subtheme, named &quot;Bat Lord&quot;. But this set, dragon rider, isn't very completed. The set Bat Lord had a knight, his helmet, a staff with a bat, a cover, and a silver sword. This is more proper to the minifigure rides a dragon, without many equipments, only with a weapon(in this set is a axe), a helmet(a silver one) and a shield. This is a good set, but the &quot;Bat Lord&quot; set is greater. Altough it, this set still deserving a  5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"DrathMaul1997","2010-08-12T09:49:16.09Z","Good for £3","<p>I got this set from Toys R us if I remember rightly. I don't recall what the price was but Brickset says it was $5 in the US, coming to about £3 in the UK I think, If you can get it for this low a price I would recommend getting it.</p><p>The dragon is the largest part of the set (forgive me for stating the obvious) And is Pretty nice. Its body is almost completely solid, the only separate parts (and the only bits that move) are the tail, top jaw, arms, and wings. There is also a flame that can be put in the mouth, giving the impression that it is breathing fire. The only con I can find is the fact that it's not very moveable.</p><p>The mini figure is <i>Very </i>cool, he comes with a shield, Giant Axe and a Very shiny Helmet, Which comes with a set of horns to put on it. Another nice part is the fact that he comes with <i>Printed trousers</i>!! At the time these where very rare (and they aren't too easy to find Nowadays) so this is very nice.</p><p><br></p><p>So, that's it.
