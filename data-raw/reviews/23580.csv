"Odeinoichus","2014-08-14T16:00:12.65Z","They fight...","<p><strong>Set #71005 Itchy: </strong>A rather odd choice for the first batch, I suppose if this is it for The Simpsons there will be a lot of fans who wish that LEGO had given us a few more characters besides these cartoon mascots, however seeing as how The Simpsons are well known for this particular in-world cartoon a lot of fans might have wanted to see them.</p>

<p>Itchy is the weakest choice of characters, however he&#39;s still excellently detailed and sculpted. His torso and legs are again, unique, the torso is a double-toned colour with orange and the same light blue colour of his flesh.&nbsp;His accessory is the large club first seen with the Caveman, he&#39;s actually fairly easy to find because of this and I accidentally wound up with two.</p>

<p>Overall while I appreciate LEGO reaching out to all corners of the Simpsons mythos for characters I do find that Itchy and his partner are the weakest of the selection of characters. Mostly because they stand out more next to other LEGO Mini-Figs and also they are pretty violent characters. I also don&#39;t like the materials used for the heads, Itchy&#39;s head is a more rubber like material which may or may not deteriorate over time, and it squeaks obnoxiously whenever you turn it on the torso peg to have him look in other directions.</p>

<p>I recommend this figure more for completionists and dedicated fans of the show, casual collectors might be more interested in just sticking with the denizens of Springfield and not the cartoon world within a cartoon. On the plus side he is one of a handful of Mini-Figures with a printed belly button.</p>

You see, within The Simpsons is a cartoon called &quot;Itchy and Scratchy,&quot; which is a direct knock-off of Warner Bros&#39; Tom and Jerry. Itchy and Scratchy is an overly violent show, so getting them in this series is somewhat surprising. Itchy was pat of the first series to cost $3.99.</p>

<p>Itchy&#39;s huge, ridiculous head sculpt is so fantastic. Of course like the rest of the series, It does look a tad bit creepy, seeing it in 3D, considering The Simpsons is a 2D cartoon. This headpiece is made entirely out of rubber, which some might despise, since rubber is more prone to damage. Personally, I don&#39;t care about the use of rubber, as it doesn&#39;t really bother me. The moulding around this piece is pretty intricate, especially around his huge, dish-like ears.</p>

<p>Itchy&#39;s torso is not useful outside the setting, but it isn&#39;t supposed to be, since it was designed for this particular character. Itchy has no back printing, but his dual-moulded arms are very welcome, especially coloured in orange and light blue.</p>

<p>Itchy&#39;s small legs have no printing, but they are cool to get in that shade of blue. His club is certainly a very fitting accessory, acknowledging how comedically violent their show is. That club was not a new piece or anything, but it&#39;s always nice to get it with CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Overall, while I personally would&#39;ve saved Itchy and Scratchy for Series 2, seeing as they&#39;re TV characters within the show, Itchy is still a good figure. He&#39;s very detailed, and though it does look a little eery, his big, rubbery head sculpt has great detailing. Overall, he&#39;s a 3 out of 5, and the reason he&#39;s not a 4 is for his weird inclusion.</p>
