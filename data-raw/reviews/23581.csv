<p>There isn&#39;t much to discuss in Scratchy&#39;s review that wasn&#39;t already covered in Itchy&#39;s. I still find this one of the weakest out of the lot, along with his cartoon nemesis, both are up to personal tastes for collectors. I do like that Scratchy has a very unique torso and leg colour combination, this shade of grey is fairly unique for a Mini-Figure I think.</p>

<p>The new tail piece he get&#39;s is a nice accessory too, and the woodsman axe suits the character as well as can be expected. I still don&#39;t like the material used for making the heads, he and Itchy have a softer rubbery plastic that might deteriorate faster than other materials, though we won&#39;t know for at least a few years. I still find the sculpt work for the head very impressive though, it captures the character perfectly.</p>

<p>Overall, again I&#39;d only recommend this one to hard core fans and completists who want to have all sixteen figures. It&#39;s safe to skip this one for the casual collectors, hope to see more colours of the tail piece for future mini-figures though. Again he also has a bellybutton which is a nice touch and might be another useful piece for MOC Fig builders.</p>

<p>Scratchy&#39;s head sculpt is insanely detailed, and obviously, it was exclusive to this CMF. It&#39;s caste in a soft, rubber material, which some might despise. I personally don&#39;t give a darn dang whether it&#39;s plastic or rubber, but I guess I can understand someon&#39;es frustration. Nonetheless, regardless of material, it is so frickin detailed.</p>

<p>Scratchy&#39;s torso sports some fur, but there&#39;s nothing going on at the back.</p>

<p>Scratchy&#39;s tail piece was, believe it or not, a brand-spanking new part for this figure. Obviously it&#39;s been reused, recoloured, and redone numerous times since, and it&#39;s also caste in rubber.</p>

<p>Scratchy has no leg printing, but his axe sports some good detail! It wasn&#39;t new or anything like that, but it&#39;s an extremely fitting accessory.</p>

<p>Overall, my opinion for him is the same as Scratchy, except I like him a little more thanks to his new tail piece. He comes in at 4 points for me!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
