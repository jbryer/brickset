<p>I&#39;d have to say yes, Chief Wiggum may be another LEGO Cop, but he&#39;s got a great look to him. His legs are printed, his torso is single-sided print and his arms have some printing. The typical police uniform style print, however I think this print may be unique to the character. Although he doesn&#39;t have any noticeable paunch, which makes him look weird because aside from his head he isn&#39;t noticeably obese.</p>

<p>The head sculpt is great looking though and capture&#39;s the chief&#39;s face perfectly. Accessories include police baton and megaphone with actual print on the piece, it&#39;s cast in grey plastic and has an orange stripe painted on it.</p>

<p>Overall while he might just be another LEGO cop, he&#39;s a LEGO Springfield cop, and could lead your LEGO City police if you so chose. I recommend him as one of the better offerings, plus he looks great next to Ralph. If LEGO continues the Theme and makes a Mrs. Wiggum we&#39;ll have the whole family.</p>

<p>The chief&#39;s head piece is massive and spectacular, crowded with loads of fun, interesting detail. It&#39;s scattered with colour, such as blue on his police hat, the gold on his badge, his white eyes, his yellow flesh, and the bulbous hair at the back. This mould was used in 71016 Kwik E Mart, but that variation ha exclusive printing, so the piece included in this CMF is exclusive.</p>

<p>As far as his torso goes, I absolutely love it simply because of how useful it is. It can easily be slapped onto a generic LEGO City civilian, and it wouldn&#39;t even look like it came out of The Simpsons. He doesn&#39;t sport back printing, but he does have some gold detailing on his arms, which is definitely appreciated.</p>

<p>The Chief&#39;s legs are excellently decked out with various pieces of equipment, like a big, black belt and handcuffs.</p>

<p>His accessories are pretty great. He uses the Series 11 Constable&#39;s baton piece, only this time it&#39;s done in grey. He also uses a megaphone with an exclusive painted orange strip. This was before the era of dual-moulding, so it&#39;s printed.</p>

<p>Overall, Chief Wiggum is one of my favourites of the series, and not necessarily because he looks accurate to the show, because he really doesn&#39;t; I love him for his useful prints that can easily be applied to custom police characters. I also love his detailed head sculpt. Overall, this one is gonna score a 5 out of 5!</p>
