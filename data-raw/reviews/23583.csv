"Odeinoichus","2014-08-14T17:39:17.217Z","Excellent","<p><strong>Set #71005 Mr. Burns: </strong>There&#39;s nothing like a bit of mayhem in the morning, and there&#39;s nothing like having the best villain of them all in LEGO form. It&#39;s no Sideshow Bob, but Mr. Burns is a fantastic character to find in this Theme.</p>

<p>He has a unique dark green coloured torso and legs with minimal print for his suit, with a visible white shirt and black tie underneath the suit jacket. He has a wonderfully malicious looking head sculpt, matching the look of a vulture with his hooked nose and bald top surrounded by blue-grey old man hair. He also has sculpted teeth in his upper mouth visible.</p>

<p>He comes with the Inanimate Carbon Rod and the three-eyed fish printed&nbsp;on a Mini-Figure head glass bowl, two perfectly exhilarating character specific accessories for him.</p>

<p>Overall Mr. Burns is a must own character. I really hope LEGO surprises us with more Mini-Figs in 2015 so we can get Waylan Smithers to toady for him, however who can say what will happen next year. I strongly recommend him, also his entire torso is great for MOCing some business suit wearing Mini-Figs in your LEGO city. The fishbowl with mutated fish is also a great accessory.</p>

Either way, Mr. Burns is the last of the series. He includes 6 pieces. and was part of the first series to cost $3.99.</p>

<p>Mr. Burns&#39; head sculpt was a new piece for the figure, and it never appeared outside this series, like many other sculpts in this set. This head differs from most others in the series in that it&#39;s caste in rubber. I personally don&#39;t mind the use of rubber, but I guess I can understand why some collectors from hot climates might be worried about it cracking and drying. Plus, rubber gets damaged much easier than plastic. Nonetheless, I do like the printing all around, and his sharp nose is the reason why it was moulded in rubber.</p>

<p>His torso is surprisingly useful outside this setting! I can easily see it being used for MOC&#39;s, which is always great! He has no back printing, but that is to be expected.</p>

<p>His legs have no printing, however his accessory does. I know nothing about The Simpsons, so I don&#39;t know the context, but a three-eyed fish is printed on a generic, clear minifigure head. This is the only time that head piece appears in this series. He also includes a translucent green rod.</p>

<p>Overall, again, I don&#39;t know jack crap about Simpsons. I do, however, like this figure for his useful torso. I&#39;m gonna give him a 3 out of 5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
