"Novelty","2007-08-31T05:42:26.13Z","Bull's Hide","This is one of the 4 shiny chrome sets from the 2000 Knight's Kingdom line - where in each set there was one piece that was coated in a shiny layer of chrome.  This set has a horse-drawn chariot with 2 soldiers, one of which is equipped with the shiny shield.  The chariot is solidly built and seems very stable.  Unlike previous chariots though, the connection between the horse and the chariot is fixed, which conveys stability, but loses the pivoting ability.  The chariot itself is rather basic, but nicely decorated with crossbows and a flag.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-01-09T09:07:31.64Z","War Wagon","This set is the fourth and final in the collection of the four chrome armour sets in the Knights Kingdom collection from 2000. The idea is collect all four sets (4816 - 4819)and you can create a mini-fig with all chrome armour. It looks good but I don't wish to go on about it. I think I paid about $7 AUD back then, so not too bad.

This one is the second of the baddies and for a cheepie has a bit to offer. The wagon itself is very strong, sturdy and well designed, so it wont break too easily during play. It is armed with duel crossbows, one on either side, making the wagon very hard to attack. Also unlike most carts the horse is attached by fixed rods which help with the overall sturdiness of it. Speaking of the horse, it is wearing a red face shield bearing a pair of horns on top, so don't get in his way. The cart has large wheels, which are well suited and fixtures for the flag plus that rare silver shield.

The mini-figs are typical to the theme wearing black pants chain mail shirts, one bearing the bulls logo, black helmets, one has a pair of horns and the faces are quite mean and daunting looking. The driver has a whip and a sword, while the passenger arms the crossbows, with a quiver of arrows on his back.

Overall a few more pieces than the third set and a little more playability mainly due to the two mini-figs but again nothing super special. The shape is different and the well designed. I personally wouldn't want to get in it's way, thus the title. I must touch on the shield for a second and say the way its not completely metallic, with the fade to silvery while looks excellent. I would say that  this model is a 6/10 mainly because it is different to most of what I have and really looks the part. I would definitely recommend this one to a castle fan or anyone who is after a model of this nature.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This set isn't very great or very small, and needs be reviewed in comparision with sets in this size. This was a special one, due to the silver shield, one chromed piece, like others of the same subtheme. This set have two minifigures, two knights with bull as symbol. This set have a cart, with different buildings in comparision with the old ones, but have contents previously included, turning this useful. The helmet have a part to put the horns(two as one piece) above. The itens are useful, like the whip and the red flag on the cart, also the little sword(not the same silver from  the knights' catapult set)and the crossbows, good positioned at the sides of the rider minifigure above pile like pieces. In the cart can be putted one minifigure, good positioned, don't making the cart dismantles. The connection pieces are different, the old ones were more visible and had different color scheme of the set (normally were red or blue), but this have the same playabilty, can't put a minifigure in the horse, but it isn't necessary. This have too the plates that keeps the set, and the essential wheels, the same from medieval carts(don't try to put them in  city or racers, looks like nothing with them). The colors, the itens(and the helmet for the horse) and all the contents makes this set useful. The playability is easy, and the ability with the horse too, because for where this go, the cart too go. This needs a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-27T10:11:11.76Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - Bulls' Attack Wagon Review","This set is a great army builder for sure. It doesn't have any play features but we got two nice looking knight figures for the bad guys. It also comes with a silver shield which makes this set very valuable. This set also doesn't have any stickers to worry about. For pieces and minifigs it's a good set but I would recommend you to get the bigger ones first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
