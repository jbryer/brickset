Despite the ridiculouslessness, the cart in this set is rather nice - it has a handle, a flag and a good barrel for transport small things - coins, gems and the like.  It would have been great if the minifig wore a helmet instead of a crown.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Why rate this set low, is easy to play with, have a cart(is useful, many carts were used on castle themes, if you have one, this set is a option to increase this), and the king minifigure, with the crown(it isn't very shiny, but still cool). The cart also have pieces to make a small box without cover to carry some pieces or itens, and have a flag in a spear, to be the weapon of the king. Why rate this set low only because the king is riding the cart? If you have another castle minifigures, you can put this making that! It runs well and is easy put a minifigure(king or not)riding it, also three years old childrens can do that! For review this set, is necessary see if it is useful, playable, and have good contents. For a small set, this have these things, and deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
