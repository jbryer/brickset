I know she likes the Friends theme.&nbsp;It was on sale for $4.99 and looked like a smart buy.</p>

<p>The quality of the paper and the spiral binding was better than I was expecting. The paper is a true notebook-style thickness while the binding was solid and anything but flimsy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The book comes with 16 random pieces to use on&nbsp;the plate that is attached (<em>or glued I assume</em>) to the front cover. The choice&nbsp;of pieces is pretty under whelming in my opinion. The few flat plates included are neat but the other parts seem to be just a random mish&nbsp;mash of shapes and a few flower heads. I looked&nbsp;at&nbsp;the parts to&nbsp;see if something could actually be built from it all. Consider me stumped. Having said that when my neighbor gave her 8 year old&nbsp;daughter the notebook the young lady&nbsp;thought it was great.</p>

<p>Overall the rating is a 4 due to the excellent quality of the materials (<em>and the few flat plate pieces</em>). As a notebook it&#39;s a nifty LEGO-themed item and a good value at $5.&nbsp;But the pieces are a real disappointment.</p>
