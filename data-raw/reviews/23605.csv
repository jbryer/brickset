"Odeinoichus","2015-12-15T21:45:20.523Z","Slightly Mediocre, but no less Fun Polybag","<p><strong>Set #30115 Jungle Boat: </strong>This little polybag is a set from the Jungle Rescue Sub-Theme of the Friends line and it&rsquo;s a pretty straight forward looking model/set without much to say. So let&rsquo;s go over the pros and cons of this little set.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The model in this set is a decent sort. A nice little motor boat for Olivia to pilot and doesn&rsquo;t use any bad design choices. Includes lime green pieces and rose flower tops.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Olivia mini-doll included.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Also includes a frog piece.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Walkie-talkie piece is in orange, unique new colour.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Olivia Mini-Doll has no unique prints and isn&rsquo;t too special.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Limited accessories to play with for Olivia.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Set works better as an addition to the larger Jungle Rescue sets.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I would still recommend this set as a decent little polybag. The boat model itself is a fun little build and includes a nice new colour for the old walkie talkie accessory. It is however a bit weak in the choice of mini-doll piece, Olivia&rsquo;s legs are quite common in the colour scheme chosen here and her top doesn&rsquo;t match well with them. Still I&rsquo;m certain the younger builders will enjoy mixing and matching mini-doll parts.</p>

There are lots of boats and animals in the LEGO world. Lime is one of my favorite rare colors, and it doesn&#39;t clash as much as some pastels.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The bag seemed bigger than necessary for the contents. Even for a small set, the build was easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The footrest really secures the figure; I love this since minidolls often have trouble staying put. The lilypad layout was nice but the frog could&#39;ve more distinctly looked like a frog. Having the radio be bright light orange was nice for some variety.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A nice addition to my small minidoll collection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very straightforward even for a small set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It shows modern streamlined design compared to 1990&#39;s #6508 Wave Racer.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A good polybag, but not the greatest.</p>
