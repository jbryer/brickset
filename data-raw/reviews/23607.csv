I really dig it and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Awesome looking mini prop glider vehicle with way more pieces than the Repair Lift.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Arctic Scout minifigure features double-sided torso print, and leg printing, not often found in polybags. Great helmet and dark blue hands as well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Instructions simple and easy to follow.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Completed model includes printed arctic team print on a sloped piece and is a solid looking build that is fun to play with.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is back heavy, will tip over backwards when sitting on the skis, they move too easily/loosely making it difficult to sit stably without the pilot in the control seat.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Too few orange pieces, would prefer a few more orange coloured pieces to fit in with the arctic sub-theme vehicles than what is provided.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No accessories for the minifigure, no skis, no ice axes, nothing. Most unfortunate.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall good solid offering here and a great introduction to the Arctic Sub-Theme, definitely recommend tracking this one down for your City collection and polybag fans are going to love that you get a printed piece and double-sided torso and leg printing which is not often found in polybags. Buy multiples for parts and just because this is a seriously awesome little build.</p>
