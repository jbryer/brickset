I never bought the Mobile Rocket Launcher, the only original Classic Space set missing from my collection, because it seemed like just a mobile version of this fantastic base. Now, I regret that decision.....

Anyway, this set brings practicality and many new functions to your Classic Space colony. The gantry for the rocket moves, the rocket is ready for launch with a satellite on it's nose-cone, there's a fuel truck for all the other buggies running around the space sets, and it comes with two rubber hoses that can attach to most units, especially the two refueling spigots that the base provides. There is even a third fuel hose mounted on the side of the rocket gantry! I still have the original rubber hoses, and they still work great. 

The vehicles can hitch up together(and the tanker section is extremely well-designed), and the set came with 3 astronauts who use two walkie talkies, and a wrench; which was the first (and only) space tool for a long time.

This is a terrific set which looks great and provides lots of imaginative possibilities. A true classic, I had a blast putting together last night for the first time in 16 years or so. Too cool!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I love the fold arm against the rocket, perfect companion to 6970 and 483.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T00:02:15Z","Great set","This is the first set I remember getting. Awesome. The base plate was used for years by five kids and started to crack along the craters, the hoses were chewed beyond recognition and I don't think it stayed in set form for more than a day - but the little computers, the taps, the minifigs, the rocket sections all became indispensable parts of countless other models. A great set and filled with nostalgia for children of the 70s.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-20T17:17:06.123Z","A fine set.","These were the days.  Blue space stations with trans-yellow windows, plenty of little pieces and not a hint of dumbing down.  The base is the control centre for a rocket launch.  There are a couple of vehicles, including one to fuel the rocket, and the design is great.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Speninator","2009-09-05T22:57:08.28Z","cool!","This set is absolutely terrific, and in it comes with a small car to tow a fuel tank a rocket a control room three figures and many rare pieces.

CAR: It is nice, mainly because it is the right size to fight in the palm of my hand. It also has a pair of air tanks at the front, but they fall off too easy, so they are just spare tanks for astronauts who have lost their own. Where could they lose them though? This is before aliens existed.

TANKER: This tanker here is pretty useful for transporting any of your valuable fuel any where else. It has two pipes under neath it's tank and you can attach it  to the fuel dispensers to load up.

ROCKET: Tis, This rocket isn't exciting. All it is is, white and black. It has, a wierd thing on the top. And it can be launched, two the sky.

BUILDING: This building is simple, yet has a big effect on the set. It has six control panels inside and on the top it has a large rotating radar, for detecting where the rocket is.
Then it is connected to where the rocket can land, and it branches off to be come the fuel dispensers. There also is a post that connects to rocket to load up fuel, and it will drop when It launches.


Overall, terrific for its age.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rollo_Tomassi","2009-10-15T21:35:42.59Z","We are GO for launch, Alpha-1!","Just bought this today (30 years too late) and I might be more impressed than I was when I was five!  The control room is full of computers and the yellow trans windows are very nice.  The radar on top is a brilliant mechanical design.  The launch brace for the rocket is very cool (and is way underused in later sets). Even the old school ""faucet"" and ""steering wheel"" pumping valves add to the playability. And my favorite part is the little 2-part mini vehicle.  The first is simple but effective little land rover.  And it connects to a very awesome little tanker truck complete with fueling hoses!  Why did not more sets have little fueling tankers?  I would have been driving all over the place with that little tanker refueling my Starfleet Voyager and other space and ground vehicles!! 

In any case, this entire set works together for the single purpose of launching the rocket and satellite into orbit.  A very classy playset that still looks great 30 years later.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"skinnylawyer","2012-10-16T02:20:00.43Z","My first-ever Lego set back in the day","<p>Back in my childhood, this was first of the two Lego sets I owned - I got it when I was 7, and it was given away when I was 12. Now that I am 36, and have rediscovered Legos, I had to make sure to add this set back to my collection, and via a lucky eBay bid, a decent example joined my collection for about USD $60 including shipping.</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>Pretty well illustrated and straightforward. Though it is important to position the foundation pieces on the crater base plate right - it was a bit of a challenge back in my childhood.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>A very contemporary science fiction approach to this set, with seven computer terminals: three blue ones overhead in the control room, three blue ones at waist level in the control room, and one gray one on the tanker truck.</p><p>Also back in the day, I thought of the transparent pieces as very awesome, especially in the case of the yellow transparent pieces: nine 1x4 bricks for side windows of the control room, and one 6x8 plate for the control room roof. I am a big fan of the Lego Space Classic's early building color scheme in general (blue buildings, gray vehicles, yellow windows).</p><p>Love the steering wheels being used as valves for the refueling mechanism. Also love the elbow pieces being used to build the fuel tanker. The launch tower's ability to swing away is another plus.</p><p>This is an early Space Classic set, so the rocket is only a stack of 2x2 cylindrical bricks that have no structural reinforcement at all. A common complaint is the tendency of the rocket to fall apart in mid-play, which I do remember. Additionally, the radar dish is solid rather than hollow (I prefer it that way).</p><p>Last, but not the least, the crater base plate. I love it. Perfect for testing the fuel tanker truck's terrain-navigating abilities.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I absolutely adore the astronaut minifigures that were the inhabitants of Lego Space. This set comes with three: one red, and two white. The white minifigures have some yellowing due to the aging, but are presentable. All three minifigures come with the Space Classic logo on the torso, which has a tendency to wear out and fade over time with play; my set's minifigures have moderate fading, but they don't look too bad. I've always loved the air tanks and the helmets of the Space Classic minifigures.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>With 187 pieces, the build took me only an hour - and only because I took some time to clean some of the dirtier pieces using soap and a toothbrush.</p><p>The tanker truck is built first, and they are very straightforward construction. The fuel tank itself (rear half of the truck) is clever, consisting of two identical stacks of four gray 2x2 cylindrical blocks each turned on the side, and attached to the chassis via elbow pieces. Love the way that a 1x2 gray tile with protrusion, a common piece in Space Classic sets, is used as the attachment point for the rubber fuel hoses.</p><p>The base is a straightforward, easy build, once the foundation pieces are properly placed on the crater plate. Not many potential areas for mistakes either.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks awesome, and quite playable. Thanks to a tanker truck and three minifigures, it's got many play possibilities even as a standalone set, and if other Space Classic sets (such as vehicles) are added, the possibilities go up even further.</p><p>Now that I am a grownup, my Lego Space Classic collection is a nice decoration on my bookshelf, and even for that purpose, this set does not disappoint at all.</p><p>The use of a crater plate makes the set easy to move around for display or play.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>This was an awesome set back in my childhood, and remains an awesome set today. I'm so glad to have this set in my possession again, reminiscing my childhood days while relishing my present day as a grownup collector of Lego sets. It is also a nice look back into what made science fiction ""click"" back in the day; while the kinds of computer terminals that are portrayed in this set look outright dated by today's standards (they are too big, the screens appear to be CRT monochrome, too many complicated buttons/switches, etc), they would have been considered the wave of the future when this set was introduced in the late 1970s.</p><p>I have no memory as to what the cost was back when this set was new, but I am only giving 3/5 for value, because on some eBay auctions, the price can shoot up well past $100. Though again, for what I did end up paying ($60 including shipping), considering the collectible value and nostalgia, it's been a much better value proposition - for me.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,3
"iwybs","2018-09-27T04:18:49.607Z","Son of Apollo","<p>A friend of mine once asked why I like Classic Space so much.&nbsp; I replied that unlike any other Space subtheme, the first waves of Classic Space feel like they could represent a real future in our solar system.&nbsp; The moonbases of Classic Space might be on our moon, or they might be on the moons of Jupiter, but they are in our imminent future if all goes well.&nbsp; Precisely because they are so plain, the Classic Space minifigures can represent real-world astronauts or cosmonauts much better than the more detailed minifigures of later themes, and their big smiles just give you a good feeling about everything they do.&nbsp; After about 1984, though, Lego Space is firmly in the land of comic books, neon lights, and Saturday morning cartoons.</p>

<p>The Alpha-1 Rocket Base is probably the best example of this.&nbsp; Nothing says far-future tech beyond anything we would know how to do if we would just get back to the Moon already.&nbsp; Any sounding rocket launched from a lunar base will need a firing table, a fueling tower, a fuel truck; it will need valves on the ground through which to pump the fuel; it will need a blockhouse for launch control and tracking equipment; a little rover will be needed to get around the launch site just as much as little golf carts are needed to get around scientific and industrial campuses on Earth.&nbsp; For lack of an atmosphere, the sounding rocket will need no payload fairing or guidance fins, and it will have a large nozzle for maximum expansion of the exhaust gases.&nbsp; There will be no pressing need to build the rocket as a long cylinder for aerodynamic purposes, but there won&#39;t be any pressing need to abandon the long-established form of a rocket either.</p>

<p>This rocket base, then, is as realistic as a rocket base that&#39;s not part of the Town or City themes can be, and it looks great.&nbsp; Later Space rocket bases are more fanciful, sporting large areas of glass or profusions of bizarre dishes that must be comm equipment of some kind, launching rockets with guidance fins and neon colors or absurdly proportioned compartments for minifigures, or being built into moving mountains and guarded with flying saucers.&nbsp; In other themes, the Discovery sets had a pair of nice rockets of similar size, but they didn&#39;t interact with minifigures very well.&nbsp; The 2011 Space subtheme&nbsp;of City had a nice realistic rocket with crawler, service structure, and blockhouse, but its very realism limits storytelling possibilities, as any kid who&#39;s reasonably well-read about the space program knows that its rocket can&#39;t send a man to the Moon.&nbsp; By setting itself just far enough ahead as to be actually&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;the Moon and adopting a Kubrickian&nbsp;aesthetic, the Alpha-1 Rocket Base is just realistic enough to satisfy space buffs while still lending itself to all sorts of out-of-this-world adventures.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen copies of this set go for about $60-100 on eBay, depending on condition and completeness.&nbsp; That&#39;s a pretty good price - right about in line with inflation and comparable with more recent rocket bases.&nbsp; If you&#39;re lucky, you might even catch it for $40.&nbsp; You should definitely get it if you can.&nbsp; It&#39;s a true classic.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-03-30T21:05:49.51Z","Small but Excellent Base","<p>So I still have all my Classic Space sets from when I was a kid. However, there are two things that I never had, a crater plate and a base. All my sets are vehicles, either ships or terrestrial vehicles. This set therefore filled the two major gaps in my collection. While it did cost me about $50 to piece together on bricklink, considering that is including the crater plate as well as quite a few translucent yellow and printed parts I decided it was justified. Now that it&rsquo;s complete I&rsquo;m really glad I have it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Set</b> <b>and</b> <b>Playability</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes it is a very small base, the actual &ldquo;house&rdquo; really can&rsquo;t fit more than 2 minifigures comfortably. But it does have some nice printed computer panels, including some inverted ones which look very nice. In fact it&rsquo;s small size is rather believable seeing how it would be very difficult to transport a larger structure to the moon.&nbsp;The radar dish on top of it is actually very cool with a full range of motion and quite a bit of detail. It also has a launching platform which is pretty cool and very reminiscent of the Apollo missions. While I do have a mobile rocket launcher, this is much more believable, plus it comes with a very realistic satellite so that the rocket actually serves a purpose. Yes, it may not be to scale, but it is large and it would be unreasonable to make it any bigger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also comes with a very cool fueling car and hoses to transfer fuel with which is a pretty unique item for Classic Space. Obviously space ships need fuel but no other sets in my collection address this requirement for powering vehicles. This adds a lot to the playability of this set, but also to all my other sets, in a way I now have a lunar gas station!</p>

<p>&nbsp;<b>The</b> <b>Build</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like any set from the 80&rsquo;s you won&rsquo;t be blown away, but it does make nice use of hinges, seats, and a lazy susan&nbsp;to make it so it isn&rsquo;t just standard stacking. It&rsquo;s a little hard to see where to place bricks on the plate and the launching tower, and it probably doesn&rsquo;t help that I had to download instructions, but with some very careful counting you can figure it out. A decent sized chunk of the set is the tanker, and it may actually be the most interesting due to the SNOT technique used for the tanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>There are a lot of really useful parts in this set, namely to trans yellow and printed slopes, but also the hoses, sink faucets (which I had never seen before), and a bunch of seats that allow for simple SNOT builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>While it is small, it is One if a few&nbsp;bases built on a crater plate and I believe the only Classic Space set to address the need for fuel. And since it&rsquo;s much more fun to fly or drive around than it is to do research or sleep (what else do you do in a base), this set definitely makes a lot of sense for anyone looking for a Classic Space base. The set is from the late 70&rsquo;s, so before I was born, but fits in just fine with all my early to mid 80&rsquo;s sets. The only difference is that it probably has a little more gray than my other sets, but nothing wrong with that!&nbsp;The price was very high, but any other base would probably have cost me a lot more, and the crater plate didn&rsquo;t really cost me any more than if I was to buy a standard 32x32 baseplate new in a store. I highly recommend this set as it is a lot of fun to play with and will definitely compliment your Classic Space fleet.&nbsp;</p>
