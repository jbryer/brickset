Anyways, onto the review. I preordered Lego: The Hobbit for my 3DS, not so much for the game but for the preorder figure. Good Morning Bilbo Baggins&nbsp;comes in a polybag&nbsp;and has only four pieces, but the minifigure is very nice and worth preordering the game for.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: Arvo-FS, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Parts</span></p>

<p>With only 4 parts, there isn&#39;t much to say here. The robe is cute and if you do a lot of MOCs then you might be able to use it somewhere.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The whole thing <i>is </i>a<i>&nbsp;</i>minifigure. Bilbo is adorable in his robe, and he has a double sided head, one smiling and the other worried. I think this is the same head used in the Bag-End set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Four parts, 5 second assembly. It wasn&#39;t fun or boring, it&#39;s just putting together a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Bilbo looks good, and is fun to play with, depending on how many other sets you have. If this is your only LotR/Hobbit set, the playability would be 1 star. If you have more, then it could be 5. It&#39;s fun putting Bilbo in situations he was not expecting to happen, like putting him in the Battle at the Black Gate!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The preorder was worth it, and I&#39;m glad I did it to get is minifigure. He&#39;s cute, the game is fun, and it was overall a good deal. If you haven&#39;t preordered the game and you can find it online for a good price, grab it!</p>

"lkb57","2014-04-23T05:53:06.023Z","Mr. Baggins of Bag End","<p>This is a fantastic minifig, and definitely one that collectors will want to get their hands on. Bilbo comes with a double-sided &quot;night-robe&quot; torso that also includes printing on the arms, and a two-expression face . . . one happy, one nervous.</p>

<p>The cons? Well, at the moment, the only way to get this minifig&nbsp;brand new is to have pre-ordered the new <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/5004205-1/The-Hobbit-PS4-Video-Game"">Lego Hobbit video game</a>, which means you have to shell out $50 for the whole game. Or you can pay something like $20 bucks to get the minifig second hand through Ebay.</p>

<p>Like many others, I wish TLG&nbsp;would make these exclusive minifigs&nbsp;more readily available. 20 bucks is a lot to fork over for a minifig. Other than the price, though, I&#39;m a happy camper with this little guy. If you&#39;re a true-blue LOTR/Hobbit fan, you&#39;ll want to add this Bilbo variant to your collection. If you&#39;re a more casual collector, skip this and get more Lego bang for your buck with another set.</p>

"Emmafofemma","2014-11-04T00:42:36.01Z","""Nope you can't come in, you've come to the wrong house!""   ","<p>After recently re-watching the extended edition of The Hobbit, I came over an interesting discrepancy in the naming of this set&nbsp;that I felt motivated enough to mention in my first&nbsp;review&nbsp;for this website. It would seem that&nbsp;the minifigure of Bilbo&nbsp;Baggins, while amazing and highly detailed, was&nbsp;labeled Good Morning Bilbo Baggins&nbsp;but in actuality&nbsp;he&nbsp;wore this outfit exclusively at night in the film when he greeted the dwarves at his entrance, so really he should be &quot;Good evening&quot; Bilbo Baggins. It was actually his outfit in the Bag End set that he greeted Gandalf in the film in.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just another standard polybag. Not much worth mentioning, although the picture&nbsp;makes a great background&nbsp;for Bilbo, depicting him in his natural environment.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>4 pieces are included to make up the minifigure:&nbsp;a pair of short legs&nbsp;in a dark red or maroon color, a highly detailed torso of the hobbits patterned&nbsp;robe that include&nbsp;printed arms, a head piece (the same included in Bag End If i&#39;m not mistaken), and a hairpiece that is used for all minifigure versions&nbsp;of&nbsp;hobbits that comes in Bilbo&#39;s dirty blond hair color.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As minifigures go for the hobbit line this is one is one of the more detailed ones to come out of the line. I don&#39;t believe any other minifigures have arm printing out of the theme but I&nbsp;may be mistaken.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quick. Simple. One of the most common builds for Lego fans is assembling figures to go along with their set so most shouldn&#39;t have a hard time building this product&nbsp;unless they are&nbsp;unfamiliar with Lego&#39;s before receiving this.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A beauty on its own and looks great when placed inside Bag End.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you are a collector of the Hobbit this is a must have, and is well worth paying third party prices &nbsp;which I believe are currently somewhere around&nbsp;$20-$30. Even if you are not a collector you still might want to consider picking this up if you&#39;re willing to pay the price because it is an amazing figure with beautiful detail.</p>

"LordofHobbits","2016-08-28T22:27:55.59Z","Best Minifigure Ever!","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With the highly detailed torso print and dark red short legs, I consider this to be one of the best minifigures of all time!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; There&#39;s not much in way of box or instructions as it is a polybag, but I really don&#39;t think the art on the polybag does the figure justice.&nbsp;It&nbsp;looks a lot better than what is displayed on the packaging.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With the exclusive print and rare dark red short legs, this minifigure&nbsp;has excellent parts for a single minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Again, since it is a polybag, there&#39;s nothing much in way of build or minifigures,&nbsp;as it is in its entirety, a &nbsp;minifigure.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The completed model looks excellent on display with the highly detailed torso print!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My opinion has many pros and cons. It has next to to nothing in build process or playability, but I think the pieces and display value make up for it, especially as it was free. It&#39;s a great minifigure with great detail, but I would only recommend it for collectors. It is the most excellent minifigure I have ever seen, though!</p>

"NotoriousJam","2022-02-18T08:06:16.647Z","A cozy and detailed minifigure to bring warmth to any home, best in a hole in the ground!","<p>The Good Morning Bilbo Baggins minifigure is such a happy and heartwarming little hobbit figure! The small intricate patchwork of his bathrobe just captures the level of detail and textures which the LOTR and Hobbit sets gave us in nearly each&nbsp;LEGO minifigure, with little reflective copper swirls encircling the front, back, and arms of his little robe! The arm printing is very well done additionally, and makes up for the lack of leg printing. The medium dark flesh (not really a suiting name for the colour)&nbsp;hair piece captures the curliness of humble little Bilbo perfectly. The use of a less common smiling expression, only seen elsewhere in the Hobbit set #79003 An Unexpected Gathering, is a very nice touch as well.</p>

<p>This minifigure has one of the most detailed torsos in my opinion from the Hobbit lineup, and can make any LEGO household more welcoming and peaceful (as long as no dwarves stop by for a visit!), and is easily one of my personal favourite obscure minifigures to be made for the Hobbit theme! We may have not asked for a Bilbo Baggins in a bathrobe, but we got one, and oh boy is he wonderful!</p>
