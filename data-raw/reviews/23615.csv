This is a real shame because they had planned to make the third film a full DLC package once released, as of this date those plans have been pretty much forgotten. Which is unfortunate, but we&rsquo;ll get back to that at the end, for now let&rsquo;s discuss the game.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>Much like The Lord of the Rings we are given an extensive Hub World to explore and interact with. All of Middle-Earth returns, from The Shire to Erebor, in fact I believe we even get to visit Mordor at some point for a few hub world puzzles, which is rather interesting.</p>

<p>The game looks and plays like The Lord of the Rings, with some impressive design choices and a great looking group of Minifigures with a unique and diverse set of skills. The game is also broken up between daytime events and nighttime events. Unlike other titles TT did not provide much for DLC content with this title. Just a set of characters to add to the Free Play selection.</p>

<p>They&rsquo;ve included more forging of items quests as seen in the original title and created some new build puzzles for Middle-Earth. Overall a decent looking game.</p>

<p><strong>Game Play</strong></p>

<p>You get to travel through An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug. Once you finish that there&rsquo;s a lot to collect and experience in the hubworld, with tons of stuff to do in searching through Free Play levels and the like. Dialogue is used from the films and new material has been recorded for the quests using voice talents not those found in the film.</p>

<p>The biggest problem with the game is it plays as an unfinished adventure. Because The Battle of the Five Armies is not represented the story ends abruptly, the game ends and you&rsquo;re left with an incomplete adventure.</p>

<p>I did not encounter any of the typical glitches that TT LEGO games usually have, perhaps I was lucky in that case as I have heard it does suffer from other reviewers. However there isn&rsquo;t much of an issue with this game on that front compared to others. There are a lot of Mythril Bricks and collectibles to find though, and sometimes the game refuses to spawn certain characters when you expect them to appear.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t really recommend this game for the most obvious of reasons. The story is incomplete. It doesn&rsquo;t conclude the story naturally and you&rsquo;re left with only two movie&rsquo;s worth of levels to explore and enjoy. It&rsquo;s a huge shame because I would have enjoyed hearing Sir Christopher Lee reading the narrative during the third film&rsquo;s cut scenes. He was the true highlight of the game and makes it worth owning for fans of The Hobbit, however I still feel that TT and WB Interactive cheated everybody with this title by not waiting and making it a full and complete game with all three films. I hardly think we&rsquo;ll ever see an update for this game, extremely disappointing.</p>
