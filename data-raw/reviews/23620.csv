"mcklego","2014-08-02T22:40:39.2Z","One of the greatest sets I've built","<p>After collecting over 100 sets of lego this will be my first review. One of the greatest sets I&#39;ve built, although I do have a couple of criticisms.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Set comes with several numbered bags for 3 build stages across 2 books. At first I thought this was a bit of a cop-out but soon realised why Lego had done it - this set has a lot of small parts that come in very small quantities... just sorting one set of bags took some time and created and array of piles many of which were only a couple of parts.</p>

<p>Instructions are clear enough in good light but in lower levels, or if the light is caught wrong on glossy pages can be difficult to distinguish some colours. The various translucent colours and grey or metallic pieces are perhaps the hardest to distinguish.</p>

<p>The box is a bit weak in my opinion for the price.It would be nice if products in this price bracket and up came in boxes similar to those found in the Architecture series of sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of unique pieces in unique colours. I&#39;d guess this set has more Earth Green (or I prefer racing green!) bricks than any other out there.</p>

<p>Whilst there are not that many stickers, I&#39;m never been a fan of them on any sets (as they have perished slowly on many of my older sets). Here you get number plates and you can choose from a few regions, front and rear Mini badges, left and right Mini badges and stickers for the front and rear pillars that hold the roof. Would be nicer if they were printed on, although even if they do perish as a whole they are unlikely to diminish the impression of the model too much.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took around 2 hour per book at a steady pace (including unboxing and sorting). Some unusual building techniques and a very dense built gives the final model a real weight and quality feel.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great, would have been nice to have front wheels which steered, but would have been difficult in the compact form. Personally I would have preferred the engine to be sacrificed if necessary to accommodate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set overall, shame about packaging and stickers but would highly recommend as a whole. I&#39;m sure the set will be seen as a classic in years to come which is only fitting of this classic little car.</p>

"FlagsNZ","2014-08-16T08:13:04.523Z","Nostalgic return to the Mini","<p>My first car was a metallic blue 1275&nbsp;GT Mini which was a Mk IV model assembled in New Zealand in 1980. This Lego set is a faithful&nbsp;rendition of the Mk VII Mini which were assembled in Britain between 1996 and 2000.</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini"">The Mini</a> is an iconic British car which revolutionised&nbsp;the motor vehicle industry in the 1960&#39;s. With its transverse front wheel drive engine and its extremely compact size, the Mini changed the small car paradigm.</p>

<p>The Mini was voted the second most influential&nbsp;motor car of the 20th century behind the Ford Model T.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a box packed full of parts. There are several bags which are numbered into building stages 1, 2 and 3.</p>

<p>The instructions come in two books; book 1 is for building stages 1 and 2, with book 2 finishing off with stage 3.</p>

<p>The instructions come in a plastic sleeve&nbsp;which is lined with a card that also protects the two sticker sheets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The standout contribution in&nbsp;parts&nbsp;for this set are all the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_racing_green"">British Racing Green</a>&nbsp;bricks, plates and&nbsp;tiles. The tan and white tiles used to detail the interior&nbsp;upholstery&nbsp;also makes this&nbsp;a worthwhile build.</p>

<p>There is a four cylinder engine under the bonnet with an oil cap on the top. This is revealed when the bonnet is opened&nbsp;up.</p>

<p>I especially like the round headlights and fog lights on the grille with small round indicator lights. It is clearly the profile of a Mini.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5568/14932645015_6bdd4ceb4e.jpg"" style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16.363636016845703px;"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a really neat build. It took a few hours and was never a drudge. Lego has developed some clever ways&nbsp;of using parts which means that the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Advanced-Models"">larger Creator</a> sets are very realistic.</p>

<p>The finished model is well built and very solid.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The set is finished off with a&nbsp;picnic&nbsp;basket with a&nbsp;freshly&nbsp;baked&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4622738"">loaf of bread</a>, a&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4178398"">bottle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/3000240"">glasses</a>&nbsp;and two wedges of&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6023173"">cheese</a>. A <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6057892"">picnic blanket</a>&nbsp;offsets this and all can be fitted neatly into the boot.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">It is the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4125213"">steering wheel</a>&nbsp;which lets this model down. It is large and out of scale with the rest of the model.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3907/14745985379_e8750c3d88.jpg"" /></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">I have tried out a&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4580510"">smaller steering wheel</a>&nbsp;which is found in some Technic sets. I think it is a better fit for this model. From memory, the steering wheel in my Mini was small in size therefore I believe&nbsp;this building variation is faithful to the real car.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5578/14746083687_c20b6a9e00.jpg"" /></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">As this is a British car, it is good to see that the steering wheel is on the right hand side and the set has not been designed for&nbsp;continental drivers.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Using this smaller wheel leaves room so that the non-functional gear&nbsp;stick and hand brake can be operated more effectively.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;""><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5552/14745984959_2041a75ee7.jpg"" /></p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The wheels don&#39;t steer but I think it would be difficult to make a steering system&nbsp;that would work with the existing <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6056443"">wheel arches</a>. The hubs would need to be modified.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The wheels are finished off with <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4617460"">hub caps</a>&nbsp;making them look like mags.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">There is a mix of printed bricks and stickers. There has been a big discussion recently on the <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/11981/sticker-horror"">use of stickers in Lego sets</a>&nbsp;and I won&#39;t add to that here.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The silver racing stripes down each side of the body,&nbsp;all the gauges and radio on the dash board are printed.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">There are two sticker sheets; one for Mini Cooper logos and the other having a selection of registration plates for different countries. There is also some black and green stickers&nbsp;designed to make the front and rear <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6055224"">roof&nbsp;pillars</a> appear thinner.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">I haven&#39;t applied any of the stickers and it has not detracted from the overall look of the finished set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a fantastic display model and would look great at home or work. It is a very realistic rendition of the Mk VII Mini and can be clearly identified with any model of the Mini.</p>

<p>The two doors open, as does the bonnet and boot. There is a spare tyre&nbsp;under the floor in the boot and the picnic set.</p>

<p>The roof lifts off revealing all the detail of the interior.</p>

<p>This is a collectors set which will appreciate in value.</p>

"DeeHants","2015-01-30T23:16:56.033Z","Faithful to the original","<p abp=""642"">Given the original Mini has&nbsp;no straight lines, this model does a very good job of imitating it.</p>

<p abp=""642"">There is a huge amount of detail packed in to such a small space, from the spare wheel, to the seat detailing, to the dash, engine and the flood lights, yet despite all that, it&#39;s still a very sturdy model.</p>

<p abp=""642"">There is a nice selection of rare parts, and the build makes some nice use of SNOT, but wasn&#39;t that complex.</p>

<p abp=""642"">All in all, this is a very worthwhile buy and you&#39;ll enjoy the build&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;displaying&nbsp;it afterwards :)</p>

"ZooMotorPool","2015-06-14T19:48:07.533Z","Mini Cooper Mk. VII: A LEGO for Petrolheads","<p>I was a long time LEGO player (you can see my collections). I enjoyed the building process the most after I find out that I tend to destroy and re-build the whole set every time I get bored with arranging their display. They are now mostly gone, because I was just a child back then. There are a few survivors, the 1997 LEGO Divers theme are the only complete set that I have right now.</p>

<p>I have many hobbies, being quite a petrolhead is one of them. So, Shell started offering LEGOs back in 2012, and again in 2015. I decided to get the <strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40195-1/Shell-Station"">40195-1 Shell Station</a></strong> from nearest petrol station. The building process sparked back my interest, but sadly it was too late, I only managed to get <strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40194-1/Finish-Line-Podium"">40194-1 Finish Line &amp; Podium</a></strong> and <strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40192-1/Ferrari-250-GTO"">40192-1 Ferrari 250 GTO</a></strong>. Not a particularly great set, but it did spark my interest in LEGO back.</p>

<p>And then I saw this mark 7 Mini Cooper. After contemplating for several weeks, I decided to get one anyway. It is labelled as &quot;Creator&quot; &quot;Expert&quot; and &quot;16+&quot; How hard can it be? Especially for a veteran builder like me.</p>

<p>This review will be mostly about &quot;old LEGO guy&quot; trying the new LEGO stuffs.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>As you can see in brickset.com page of the product <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10242-1/Mini-Cooper-MK-VII"">here</a>, the box is rather large. Here is a picture of it with a pen, Mentos container, and a Blackberry to scale (at the bottom is the finished model).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v242/Johnsy/LEGO/Mini%20Cooper%20Mk7%20Picture%201.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 282px;"" /></p>

<p>The box also gives you approximation of the size of the real thing using the tyre as the 1:1 picture scale.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v242/Johnsy/LEGO/Mini%20Cooper%20Mk7%20Picture%202.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 282px;"" /></p>

<p>Older LEGO boxes are less pictorial, but when they are at this size, they will feature a flappable solid cover lid that allows you to peek the contents inside through a clear plastic &quot;window&quot;. This one doesn&#39;t have it. It doesn&#39;t have a cardboard container and clear hard plastics that usually hold the minifigs like the old ones. Everything is put into numbered polybags, which are let loose inside this huge box.</p>

<p>These are new things for a LEGO hobbyist rejoining from 1997. There is more than one instruction book, which I consider as pretty normal due to the number of pieces and complexity of the build. But there is no LEGO collection showcase booklet, because today, there is LEGO.com.</p>

<p>So do the boxes from old era wins or the new 2014 boxes have toppled them? Well, I prefer the older ones, they feel more expensive and just better.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Modern LEGOs are pretty easy to build despite the &quot;Expert&quot; label. Because the instruction booklet of a LEGO set today is pretty much step-by-step with only 4 to 5 pieces installed at maximum for a step (probably more for 1 stud-sized pieces). Each book also corresponds to which polybag numbers. It is very neat and well-sorted, and little wonder that they needed to print more than one booklet. This allows for team-building, which I used to do with my younger brother.</p>

<p>Back in the old days, they don&#39;t give you insets and they don&#39;t give you which part are being installed, the pictures are mostly showing pieces that are &quot;just there&quot;, which &quot;wasn&#39;t there&quot; in the step before. So you have to carefully scrutinise each picture before moving on to the next one. I believe this is more fun, although quite frustrating if you missed one or two pieces.</p>

<p>I have to say, the new instruction booklets are more interesting. It allows more than one person to build the LEGO. In the olden days, since there is only one book for a relatively big sets, there can only be one builder, and the other have to fill other role that doesn&#39;t need the booklet, such as assembling minifigs and helping the builder to find the pieces (since they are not put into numbered polybags). Yes, the building process is much more enjoyable, but it is a tradeoff.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>LEGO has gone for the looks in the modern era. And it shows. We have a lot of SNOT pieces here. It arguably makes the finished model look very polished and realistic, but not very LEGO-ish in a way. My younger brother builds the <strong><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75040-1/General-Grievous-Wheel-Bike"">75040-1 General Grievous&#39; Wheel Bike</a></strong> and it doesn&#39;t impress him much. He feels that there is too much &quot;cheating&quot; going on with the new weird parts, as if we are just assembling a pre-fabricated model toy.</p>

<p>The mark 7 Mini Cooper set has a lot of things I never saw before. As an &quot;old guy&quot; I too feel that there is a lot of &quot;cheating&quot; indeed. Colours are more varying these days, especially for hidden builds, you&#39;ll see that LEGO dared to put mismatching colours.</p>

<p>&lt;picture 3&gt;</p>

<p>And stickers are plentiful this time. From the chromatic Mini emblems and the normal stickers for license plates, for which we are given extra options (British, Danish, German, US, and Australian).</p>

<p>My brother has expressed his disdain for the newer parts. But I think, we have missed quite a lot of LEGO developments. While I understand his point of view, but I think LEGO is just doing their best to expand into better &quot;Model Team&quot; sets here. Especially with this beautiful British racing green finish and very neat cheatline.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are no minifigs given for this set. I was expecting a Technic-sized minifigs. But we don&#39;t have any. So that picnic basket is for nobody. But as I see it, this is a display model. It doesn&#39;t need one.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Honestly, it is rather quick and easy. The booklet of modern LEGOs are extremely simple and very user friendly. Technic parts? Easy! New pieces and parts that are unfamiliar to veteran builders? Figurable within fraction of a second. Extremely long studs? You don&#39;t even need to count! As if LEGO has considered all of these when they design this set.</p>

<p>While I am eager to see the finished product, I also want to be challenged by the whole building process. I just didn&#39;t. For most of the process, I just rushed to finish, and found almost no difficulties beside the stickers, because we all hate stickers right?</p>

<p>&lt;picture 4&gt;</p>

<p>I like the interior build the most. It is where attention to details are being judged. My only complaint is that the steering wheel is too large that it touches the driver seat and has a very little tilt movements. The engine is the second. Everything is well-thought and the use of the claws as manifolds is genius. I was skeptical at first, but at the end of the build, the claws are neatly placed so it really looks like manifolds when finished.</p>

<p>In the end, I have to say that I enjoyed building my brother&#39;s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6338-1/Hurricane-Harbour"">6338 Hurricane Harbour</a> more. There are more things going on there than in this 1,000+ bricks set. Maybe because I was just a child being overwhelmed back then. Maybe I am currently an adult with bigger and better brain this time. But my memory is not part of that thinking process. In my mind, the older one has better building process: it is much more involving. I remembered putting in the sea walls, assembling the boat, and the control room.</p>

<p>With the new instruction book, this big Mini Cooper Mk.7 model build is just a flash. Patterning the seats is probably the most memorable part of the process. The spare wheel well is the first amazement point. The engine is the &quot;Wow! I didn&#39;t know LEGO can do that&quot; part.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>At first, it seems that LEGO is really ashamed about their trademark studs. The model is entirely covered with SNOT pieces. Nearly everyone in the house did not realise that it was a LEGO before I pointed it out. This model is &quot;that&quot; good, but at the same time, people do not see it as a LEGO, which kind of kill the purpose of building one.</p>

<p>LEGO also tries to create an illusion of thin pillars using stickers.</p>

<p>&lt;picture 5&gt;</p>

<p>From my view, it doesn&#39;t work. All I feel is another ordeal with sticker placements. I have to wrestle with my OCD all over again, hurting my finger tips, trying to slide stickers neatly into the centre of the piece. Well, why don&#39;t they use more for the interiors? The dashboard badly needs the sticker, but they just don&#39;t put any! All of the dials in the driver&#39;s panel are just speedos. Stickers will be very welcomed here.</p>

<p>&lt;picture 6&gt;</p>

<p>Lastly, everything looks perfect (I already mentioned the steering wheel), except one. One thing. The mirror! This one needs an explanation so casual viewers will understand that this little thing is a mirror.</p>

<p>&lt;picture 7&gt;</p>

<p>Newer LEGO is all about the looks, the finish, and it already trumps almost every older LEGOs that I have. Model Team can never look this good and finish this perfect. Yes it is rather boxy and not quite like the real thing despite being this huge. Nevertheless, I dare to say that this is the new LEGO high. From far away, people already know that this is a Mini, but even up close people still have difficulties to identify this model as a LEGO. It is too good to be true, yet disappointing at the same time.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The boot, the doors, and the bonnet opens nicely and offer nice eye-candy treats inside. A decent boot space for picnic needs. An interior with patterned seats that can recline and movable headrest, moving gear stick, hand brake lever, and steering wheel that can be spun around, but doesn&#39;t turn the front wheels. The wheel roll is very smooth.</p>

<p>The set is equipped with a picnic basket assembly, containing a baguette-like bread, cheese made from sloped 1x1 SNOT, a couple of wine glasses, a bottled water assembly, and a picnic mat folded nicely and fit into the boot space without hassle. This gives you an option to display the model with the picnic peripherals neatly arranged outside the car (like the box illustration) or neatly packed inside the boot.</p>

<p>Lift the boot, and you will have a spare wheel, which is different, it has different wheel (rims), noticably thinner, deeper and more pronounced treads. It will also fit nicely into the hub cap in place of the original tyre. But the thick original tyre won&#39;t fit into that spare wheel space.</p>

<p>The details are simply amazing.</p>

<p>If you have extra 1x4 SNOT in black and British Racing Green (which is probably very rare, and this might be the only set that has it), you can stick the optional licence plate number stickers and change it as you please.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Every weakness in this set is alleviated by the looks of the finished model. It will teach many creative minds in the future that yes, you can build a LEGO that looks very realistic and detailed. Every time I glanced at this model, sitting nicely at my display cupboard, I feel very fulfilled. I can&#39;t wait for LEGO releasing another iconic people car of our time models in this format. MG T? Citroen 2CV? DS? Austin Healey? Or probably more modern cars, such as NA (first generation) Mazda Miata? I can&#39;t wait.</p>

<p>This Mini Cooper mk.VII set really worth the money, the time, and the contemplating process that I&#39;ve been going through. Yes, LEGO has changed very far since the last time I played with them 18 years ago. But this is like love at first sight, I want it immediately after seeing the picture. I know the consequences, so I have no regrets. I am a petrolhead, and this thing has a character.</p>

"Wom","2016-01-15T20:49:49.62Z","Iconic British car which has a few let downs ","<p>After buying the VW T1 and the Ferrari F40 it was just a matter of time before I would buy this small British car. The other two builds were great fun and reviews on this Creator model were positive as well. This &#39;advanced models&#39; series is one of the main reasons I got back into Lego after my dark ages, combining a couple of my interests (cars, cars, more cars and Lego).&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""	http://static.tweakers.net/ext/f/Pul0145ugQgOJiRL7rncJGai/full.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<p>The almost square box I bought is missing the &#39;Expert&#39; labels these kind of sets get nowadays. It does feature a nice summer setting at the British country side. At least,&nbsp;that is what I expect from the background. Together with the displayed contents of the trunk (the Mini comes included with a full service picnic basket) it pictures an ideal setting for a car like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box opens on the top or down side, different than what you would expect. Next to all the different angels of the model there is also a picture of the real Mini. Lego based this set on the MK VII, the latest Mini of this type to be build. I think everybody agrees that this little car has been one of the most iconic cars of all ages. It was surprising to see that there is no official BMW/Mini logo located on the box. Just a small copyright text, that&#39;s all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the first things I noticed after opening the box was the quality difference of the instruction booklets. The look and feel of the first manual felt a lot better quality-wise opposite to the second part of the manual. For the instructions itself this doesn&#39;t make any difference, but I found it surprising&nbsp;to see.</p>

<p>Lego was wise in choosing the color of this model. The Racing Green fits this car perfectly. The green and white color scheme works wonders for the car, although Lego missed out on the roof. A lot of Mini&#39;s have decorated roofs with different prints. In my opinion they could have opted for an Union Jack style roof. But nothing you couldn&#39;t do yourself off course.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some stickers to be applied, but nothing too difficult. You can choose different countries for the license plates. Lego offers a couple different sets of license plates&nbsp;as a sticker. I chose the American one (Connecticut State)&nbsp;as this features my first name. I&#39;m an idiot, I know...</p>

<p>Also included are a couple of printed bricks, used for the racing stripes&nbsp;on the exterior and for the dashboard on the obvious inside of the car. Overall there are quite a lot of 1x1 parts used for this build, but nothing you haven&#39;t seen before in other sets.</p>

<p>The actual build is always the best part with these models, and the Mini is no different. Little to no repetitive actions needed and there are some really nice mini&nbsp;builds to create. The four cylinder engine is small but cleverly designed and the pic nic set is just dripping in&nbsp;cuteness&nbsp;(as stated by my girlfriend). Although the advertised age is 16+ I can imagine that children half that age could build this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lego made some choices which I find a bit hard to understand. The steering wheel used is way too big to fit properly in the car. To have the proportions right it needs to be half the size. Another this which bugs me a bit is the use of the silver cylinder&nbsp;bricks to create the &#39;chrome&#39; bumpers. As with every brick they have information printed on them. But in this case you cannot position the bricks in such a way they don&#39;t show. You can hide them, but then you make the half-way cutout visible which is also a terrible sight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After spending about three hours on building the Mini it was&nbsp;completed. This must have been a hard model to transfer into Lego, looking at the real-life&nbsp;curved car. With moveable doors, hood and trunk it checks all the things you would expect to move at&nbsp;a model like this. The interior (expect the steering wheel) looks great and detailed, the exterior is an 8/10 at best. For some reason the cars feels a lot heavier and bigger than you would expect. The details are nicely done though, but Lego needs to make sure that next time they fit a spare wheel it matches the other four. It&#39;s all in the details with cars like this.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Out of the three cars I&#39;ve build in the Creator series this one feels like the least favorite one. This&nbsp;doesn&#39;t mean this is a bad set. It just proves that the other sets are even better. The build process is heaps of fun, there is a lot of details to discover and together with the pic nic set it make for a nice display model. The roof construction is not very solid, so I wouldn&#39;t recommend this car for it&#39;s playability. All in all a great model from Lego,&nbsp;</p>

<p>BTW, If you already own this set I would recommend the following MOC:&nbsp;<a href=""http://nkubate.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=760"">http://nkubate.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;layout=item&amp;id=71&amp;Itemid=760</a></p>
