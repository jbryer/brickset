<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Gorgeous and festive packaging. &nbsp;Standard instructions. &nbsp;Nothing special here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is one of the areas where I think this set excels. &nbsp;It includes a lampstand piece that is new to me and I love the way things go together. &nbsp;There is some SNOT (Studs Not On Top) building and lots of fun ways the pieces are used. &nbsp;VERY imaginative. &nbsp;The set we have came with a trans-red stud that we used to turn the small, single reindeer into Rudolph. &nbsp;I saw another set that didn&#39;t come with this piece (the instructions don&#39;t call for it), but I had one in our stash that we added to that set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s Santa, Mrs. Claus and elves! &nbsp;What is there to say other than...FUN?! &nbsp;I love the red toy sack that Santa carries. &nbsp;Others have commented that this is new this year. &nbsp;My understanding is that, in years past, the sack was brown. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad to see the red one in this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>See comments above. &nbsp;My wife and I had GREAT fun putting this set together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A classic in my opinion. &nbsp;I just don&#39;t understand the harsh reviews on the lego shop website. &nbsp;I REALLY like this set and heartily recommend it. &nbsp;The playability is fantastic and the festive nature of the set really cheers the heart. &nbsp;Thanks Lego! &nbsp;I think you hit a homerun with this one.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Belongs in any lego fan&#39;s collection. &nbsp;Looks great! &nbsp;Good price per piece. &nbsp;Great colors. &nbsp;What&#39;s not to like? &nbsp;Merry Christmas!</p>

"FlagsNZ","2014-12-04T07:28:34.953Z","Add this set to your box of Christmas decorations","<p>I have waited until December to build this set at the same time as getting out our Christmas tree and trunk of decorations.</p>

<p>I am also enjoying each morning&nbsp;building the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60063-1/City-Advent-Calendar"">City advent calender</a>&nbsp;gifts (spoiler alert - This hyperlink will take you to images of the 24 daily gifts).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box shows what the full set will look like with Santa&#39;s house, Santa&#39;s helpers and their workshop, Mrs Clause with a tray of fresh baking, a decorated Christmas tree&nbsp;and the North Pole. There are five reindeer&nbsp;and the sleigh full of toys and a toy making machine.</p>

<p>The instructions come in two books with book one making the reindeer, sleigh, tree and North Pole. Book two makes Santa&#39;s house and the elves&#39;&nbsp;workshop.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7543/15323384343_cba951e958_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are split up into three groups of numbered bags.</p>

<p>There is a great range of interesting parts in many great colours.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with six minifigures; Santa, Mrs Clause and four elves.</p>

<p>Santa has a sack full of presents and Mrs Clause is standing in her&nbsp;long skirt and red cape with fresh baking to refuel&nbsp;the hard-working elves. As the year draws to the end,&nbsp;they have a lot of work to do.</p>

<p>There are five brickbuilt reindeer; four adults and one calf. The reindeer have their faces&nbsp;printed on a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6079045"">1x1 brick</a>.</p>

<p>Folklore suggests that Rudolf should have a red nose and that there should be <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Visit_from_St._Nicholas"">eight reindeer</a>.</p>

<p>The set came with a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4178640"">spare ball</a> which I have used as Rudolf&#39;s nose.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The set as included in the box has a very limited elves&#39; workshop. A companion <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40106-1/Toy-Workshop"">Toy Workshop</a> set compliments this set and was available <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/12550/santa-s-workshop-available-now-and-double-vip-points"">free from 1 October</a>. I have been fortunate to get two complimentary&nbsp;Toy Workshop sets and these have added substantially&nbsp;to the&nbsp;versatility of the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8646/15320754974_308ec71f27_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Each Toy Workshop comes with an extra two elves, so I have a total of eight elves to work with.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8564/15323383453_6284f53643_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The Toy Workshop comes with the Nutcracker soldier, toy bulldozer and train and two gifts already wrapped.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>These images show a fusion of Santa&#39;s&nbsp;Workshop and two Toy Workshops. I thought I would show what can be done if you have been fortunate enough to obtain the extra sets.</p>

<p>The house is orginal; it is only the workshop that has had an extension added.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7517/15941056851_87a3d5be0b_z.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The house has two levels; the ground floor with a roaring fire and a loft where Santa can read all the letters sent from children from around the world.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7473/15941057621_2c91e16105_z.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The Toy Workshops each&nbsp;come with a bench vice and a polybag full of tools. There are pots of paint and two brushes. These are essential items for a functional workshop.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8573/15943014675_6bb225d098_z.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I know that my&nbsp;review includes parts from the extra sets, but I do feel that Santa&#39;s Workshop as shipped benefits from the inclusion of the complimentary&nbsp;Toy Workshops.</p>

<p>Adding the extra work space, tools, paints and brushes completes the workshop. Extra toys reveals how hard the elves have been working.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7505/15756984489_647dfe41e0_z.jpg"" /></p>

<p>If you get the chance, add this set to your Christmas decoration inventory. If there are Toy Workshops still available, then consider getting a couple of these as well.</p>

<p>I have space set aside for the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10235-1/Winter-Village-Market"">Winter Market Village</a>&nbsp;and I am adding each of the advent calendar&nbsp;trinkets as the days are counting down. They all look great together.</p>

<p>To all the Brickset community,&nbsp;I wish you all happy holidays.</p>

"sudorum","2016-01-01T01:40:17.33Z","Santa Made it Himself","<p>Santa&#39;s the top fig in this set, no question about it. But Mrs. Claus is close behind him and proves to be an excellent interpretation&nbsp;of Santa&#39;s better half. I also appreciate the fact that Santa&#39;s slaves, er... I mean elves, all have unique faces and clothes. They could have easily been given the same&nbsp;generic faces, but Lego opted to add some individuality to them.&nbsp;I don&#39;t mind that the reindeers aren&#39;t&nbsp;molds; in fact I, think their blocky design lends&nbsp;the set a homemade feel that adds to its&nbsp;Christmas spirit.</p>

<p>The conveyor belt of toys looks absolutely great, but it&#39;s a shame that it doesn&#39;t move. And maybe I&#39;m being picky, but&nbsp;the belt isn&#39;t connected to anything, so the device&nbsp;looks as if it generates toys&nbsp;from nowhere. For my money Santa&#39;s sleigh is the highlight of the set. It&#39;s incredibly simple, but perfectly captures the&nbsp;twists and curves of Santa&#39;s iconic ride.&nbsp;There&#39;s also more than enough room for a handful of gifts in the sleigh.&nbsp;Among these gift wrapped presents are two uncommon Lego pieces&nbsp;-- a pink translucent wand and a mint green guitar. Adding a Lego package to the collection of&nbsp;gifts would have been a perfect touch, but alas, no such package is provided.&nbsp;On a down note, the sleigh is a bit lacking in reindeer and would be perfect if two more&nbsp;were included, raising the total number of reindeer&nbsp;to seven&nbsp;(including the little one).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving on to Santa&#39;s shop, the first floor is decorated with a fireplace and a decal&nbsp;portrait of Santa and the Missus&nbsp;posing in far off Fiji. A small stair case leads down to the elf workshop, which has a wooden stool and workbench for toy making.&nbsp;A ladder in the first room leads up to the second floor, which is really just a small&nbsp;room that houses Santa&#39;s chair and a stack of letters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a good holiday themed set, perhaps not as detailed as previous versions, but not lacking in holiday cheer and certainly worth being added to the Christmas collection.&nbsp;</p>

"Sethro3","2015-07-24T21:41:29.55Z","It's time to get ready for next Christmas","<p>I love the winter village series. I was excited to see another building this year instead of the Market. It feels more cohesive. This scale of building fits better with the original three installments compared to the Cottage in 2012.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;
<p>- Great scale and color scheme.</p>
</p>

<p>- New parts plus old parts in new colors. Always welcome.</p>

<p>- Number of figures</p>

<p>- Brick built reindeer exemplify what Creator is all about.</p>

<p>- Good price/piece ratio. Better price in general vs Market/Cottage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>- Elves should have more consistent uniforms similar to the CMF (in my opinion)</p>

<p>- Mrs. Claus should have a different top that matches her dress/apron.</p>

<p>- No room for the conveyer belt inside the workshop.</p>

<p>- Something feels off to me about the main window compared to the other windows.</p>

<p>- I would say no Rudolph is a con, but they said they couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t acquire the licensing to accommodate having a red-nosed reindeer. Plus, it is an easy fix on our own.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>I think this is a great addition to the winter village series, although not necessarily to the village itself. I realize it is the north pole, but that would require me to move it on a hill or something away from the rest of the village. It adds a lot of character to the series, but still feels disconnected because of the location.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt, I&#39;d still recommend getting it. They aren&#39;t available for very long after the initial release and you wouldn&#39;t want to miss out on the fun details this has to offer. Plus, you don&#39;t want to pay aftermarket prices on eBay for a set like this.</p>

"Scott1","2014-12-25T14:54:04.22Z","Nice Set!","<p>Santa&#39;s Workshop is a very nice set. There are some rare colors included. It has plenty of playability and is very detailed as well!&nbsp;It is just as good for display as it is for play!</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the minifigures. All of them are pretty good, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;don&#39;t like Mrs. Claus&#39;s torso piece.&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t &quot;flow&quot; with the rest of the body.</p>

<p>The build was alright, but when I was putting together the 2nd part of the workshop, I tried&nbsp;to put the&nbsp;roof on and&nbsp;the&nbsp;walls fell apart. It is a bit fragile when building, but other than that, it was&nbsp;easy and fun!</p>

<p>The price is very low for a set containing 883 pcs.</p>

<p>Overall, it is a&nbsp;excellent set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"harvhope","2015-12-27T16:35:10.027Z","After Christmas LEGO relaxation","<h3>Loved putting this together. &nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes with 3 different sets with various bags labelled 1, 2, or 3. &nbsp;You put together 4 distinct pieces with the two parts of the building coming together at the end. &nbsp;The instruction book is&nbsp;quite good although it is hard to tell at times between light gray, dark gray, black and sometimes even the dark brown. &nbsp;Wish they&#39;d come up with a legend for the pages. Particularly problematic for the 1 little dark purple &quot;dot&quot; I couldn&#39;t figure out where it went. Lots of left over pieces (extras thrown in it seems)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Santa Claus with beard, Mrs. Claus with cape, 4 different elves. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>This set is definitely an &quot;Expert&quot; level. &nbsp;It takes concentration too as some of the pieces are unusual placement but end up with an interesting effect - eg. fireplace or reindeer harness system. &nbsp;First they have you put together the whole reindeer, then remove the 2 pieces to allow for the harness - but instructions are a little vague here. &nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to do this while also watching Christmas movies - not recommended - had to redo a few things. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sleigh is an interesting design. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Criticism</h3>

<p>Front stoop of one story section of workshop keeps falling off while holding it to build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Opinion</h3>

<p>I really enjoyed this one - makes a good addition to the collection. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a normal box that has the &quot;Expert&quot; stamp on it. The instructions are easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The coolest new part I the set is Santa&#39;s bag in red, a new color for that part. Also, we get the elephant trunk pieces in gold for the first time. There are a decent amount of stickers, but they really do add to the overall feel of the scene. &nbsp;We also get a new print on the 1x1 tan brick that looks like eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>We get Santa, Mrs. Clause (who gets a double sided head) and four&nbsp;unique elves. &nbsp;They each have the ears molded into thier hats and one of them gets a dou sided head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set &nbsp;also includes reign deer, which are so cute and loveable. There are four adults and one kid. The adults can stand alone or attach to the sled. The child can&#39;t attach to the sled, but that&#39;s ok. Also, there is a spare trans orange stud in the set that I recommend putting on the child deer Asa nose to make the red nosed reign deer that everyone loves.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like the completed models. We get a good conveyer belt that makes toys, On it there is a racecar toy and a toy of Benny&#39;s SPACESHIP SPACESHIP SPACESHIP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The workshop house is good. There&#39;s a place for Santa to read his mail and a fireplace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really like the sled. There is room to fit many toys and four reign deer can pull the sled. It doesn&#39;t bother me that there aren&#39;t eight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also get very good Christmas tree and North Pole sign.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is great. It gives very iconic Christmas scenes that are recreated very well in Lego. This set fits perfectly in any Lego city.&nbsp;</p>

"Brick_Jay","2016-11-01T10:44:11.947Z","A nice festive set but...","<p>This is a nice set. There are many things I like, and there are things which I think could be improved. Let&#39;s start with the facts, this set retails for &pound;59.99 in the UK, has 883 parts, has 6 minifigures and is recommend for ages 12+, but I think an 8 or 9 year old could build this with no help.</p>

<p>There are 6 minifigures: Santa Claus, which is the same as the Santa from Series 8 CMFs, but comes with a new red sack. There is also Mrs. Claus, who I think, is excellent. Her parts are brilliant and comes with a plate of biscuits (or cookies). You also get 4 elves, which are nice, as they all come with the elf hat and ear&nbsp;mould from the Holiday Elf from Series 11 CMFs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Santa&#39;s sleigh is probably the best thing about the set but I still have one problem. There are only 4 reindeer (there is a total of 5 in the set) to pull Santa&#39;s sleigh, I&#39;m pretty sure there is 8 (or 9, if you include Rudolph). However, apart from that, the sleigh is impressive. It can hold many presents and it feels very festive. There is also a cute, little baby reindeer. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The machine to make toys is brilliant. It is quite detailed but wasn&#39;t hard to make at all. You can also build some little toys, which are supposed to come out of the machine. It looks like a yellow car and a mini Benny&#39;s Spaceship, spaceship, spaceship!!!</p>

<p>The actual Santa&#39;s Workshop is slightly disappointing. I wish it was bigger, the interior doesn&#39;t have much detail. There is a chair for Santa to sit and read letters, and there is a small table to build toys. However, there are some nice stickers to add inside, including a mat, which reads &#39;Welcome Ho-Ho-Home!&#39;. There is also a sticker, which shows Santa and Mrs Claus on holiday and a poster, which reads &#39;Santa Needs You&#39;. I feel like there should have been a big workshop, full of machines and toys, a kitchen to make cookies, a bedroom and a shed to hold the sleigh. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a very small Christmas tree, not like the big one in the Winter Toy Shop and there is a small sign, which reads &#39;The North Pole&#39;, which is very nice.</p>

<p>Overall, it is a nice set. The machine is nice, but I feel the workshop is far too small and the sleigh should be pulled by 9 reindeer instead of 4. However, aside from that, it is a great set and I definitely recommend you get this set (I got 2 of this set to make the workshop bigger and to have 8 reindeer instead of 4).&nbsp;</p>

"lentil","2017-01-03T19:27:00.483Z","Adorable Christmas set","<p>We received this set as a Christmas present and were quite excited to put it together. It is a cute little set chock full of details. Makes a lovely display piece, and also potentially quite fun to play with.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>I&#39;m really not sure why this set is labeled &quot;Expert.&quot; It does not have a huge number of pieces, the instructions are quite simple and straightforward, and there was nothing difficult to build. I would say an 8-12 year old child reasonably familiar with LEGO could put it together with no problems. The bags are numbered and so no piece sorting is necessary. Each step puts on only a few pieces at a time. There are a few more details than a typical young child-oriented set, but nothing warranting &quot;Expert&quot; status imho.</p>

<p>There are a lot of annoying stickers, but some good printed pieces too. The stickers are bright and really cute, to be fair.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>A great assortment, and all very well realized: Santa with red bag, Mrs. Claus with a cape and colorful tray of cookies, and four elves all with different outfits, pointy ears, and green conical hats.</p>

<h3>The Finished Model</h3>

<p>I really liked several things about this model. First, the color scheme is just lovely. Excellent use of mixed warm brown tones on the buildings - an example of fantastic use of LEGO&#39;s expanded color range. I particularly like the combination of gold lattice and vertically oriented trans red plates to form one of the fancy windows - gives a gorgeous stained glass effect. I also appreciated the stone pillars by the steps, the detailed stone chimney, and the cute little brick-built candy canes which are hinged outside the door, so they can be angled in odd directions for a jaunty effect. The string of lights on the roof is also incredibly cute and cheery. The stone steps made from round grey plates/tiles looks a bit awkward to me personally, but other than that I love the overall design of the houses. The two houses snap together at an angle (as shown in the picture) but do not hinge closed. You can also display them separately if you like.</p>

<p>I also like the anterior parts of this set. Santa&#39;s sleigh features a handsome color scheme in dark forest green, black and gold. The curved gold pieces forming the runners look great, as do the elegant black lanterns at the back. Santa&#39;s ride is stylin&#39;!</p>

<p>The brick built reindeer are beyond adorable, especially the little baby reindeer. My 10-year-old daughter immediately decried the fact that there are only 4 reindeer rather than 8, and Rudolph is missing! The last is easily rectified by swapping in a 1x1 trans red stud for the brown nose on your choice of reindeer. Perhaps the other reindeer are getting a pre-Christmas massage at the spa?</p>

<p>The only thing that really bothers me about this set is how the reindeer attach to the sleigh. They are linked to each other with a plate, so they need to be entirely parallel or it will not snap correctly. Yet the reins are so close together that they cannot physically stand exactly parallel - their antlers end up getting in the way so that one must be slightly ahead of the other. Angling the antlers differently helps somewhat, but not entirely. We did our best to smush everything in but the effect is very unsatisfying and seems strained and uncomfortable. If the reins were only one reindeer width apart this problem would have been solved - not sure why they designed it this way...</p>

<p>The little toy making machine is perhaps my favorite part of the set. It has so many little details for such a small object: two levers that move up and down, a steering wheel that turns, detailed printed gear panel, red and green trans bulbs on top, and best of all a whirling thing-a-ma-bob on top that actually spins! The design of the conveyor belt is also very nice imho - the grills look great and the bright red and white pattern on the side is simple yet very decorative.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>In truth my daughter has not played with this set yet (possibly because we got WAAAY too many other lego sets for Christmas this year...), but I think it does offer decent playable features. The toy-making machine in particular should be fun to &quot;operate&quot; (note that the conveyer belt does not actually move though), and the elves definitely look ready for lots of mischievous adventures. The interior of the house is not terribly detailed, but the workshop has a little table with paints and tools, and there is plenty of room inside for characters to hang out. The doors of course open and close and there is a ladder up to the second floor, where Santa has a big comfy looking armchair. If your kid is into Christmas play, this will probably appeal.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Very attractive for a Christmas display, gorgeous colors and details, fun and easy to build. Hope LEGO makes more along these lines!</p>
