<p>The Build</p>

<p>The building experience was quite fun and enjoyable with the stacking of the ender crystals and I loved the lego rendering of the fearsome ender dragon</p>

<p>The Finished Model</p>

<p>The finished model looked beautiful with the end stone and obsidian contrast. I loved the addition of the light-up brick and the ender dragon brick built figure was spot on. The major problem though was it lacked playability and actually contained no play features and the terrain was nice looking but vacant. I understand the end is a vacant place but I believe they could have added an exploding crystal or exploding bed play feature to make the set more interesting</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>634 pieces $70 :)</p>

<p>3 endermen and diamond steve</p>

<p>ender dragon is spot-on</p>

<p>light-up brick</p>

<p>great for display</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>Lacks play value big time</p>

<p>compact size</p>

<p>boring for a kid</p>

<p>After many years, I&#39;ve finally decided to review this set. I don&#39;t remember for how long I&#39;ve had it, I&#39;d say about 6 years is my best estimate. I really love this set, especially for that Ender Dragon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Build Experience + Model</b></p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I remember much from the build experience. The only thing I remember is that it was easy, which makes sense as this is a minecraft set.</p>

<p>The small island (forgive me for not using proper terms, I have little knowledge of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>) looks alright, but it doesn&#39;t have the unique color or texture present in the game. The towers look nice thanks to the sparse purple studs placed throughout the black build. The turrets are also cool, and one of them has a special light brick.</p>

<p>The Ender Dragon egg is a neat little add-on which gives more accuracy to the source material.</p>

<p>Finally, the Ender Dragon. It is quite large, so it manages to capture the shape and detail of the real dragon. The wings use a specialised piece which fits with the rest of the build. The play function of the flapping wings works pretty well, and it definitely allows for some fun play moments. The articulation checks out, with joints placed in all the right spots. The dragon is really all I could ask for in this iconic dragon.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Steve is decked out in his diamond armor, which is fitting for the occasion. No problems with this figure. The endermen are also surprisingly accurate, giving off a creepy vibe.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>For $70, the price per part ratio is quite low, but given the volume of plastic in this set, I feel the price is appropriate. There is sufficient play and display value to justify such a steep cost, and I feel that this dragon warrants a high price.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Amazing dragon</li>
	<li>Good endermen and Steve</li>
	<li>Fun play features</li>
	<li>Decent display value</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Mediocre p/p ratio</li>
	<li>Some bland builds</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I am so glad that I was able to get this set before it retired. While I was still a kid when I got it, I made a lot of memories with it and I will continue to cherish it. I recommend this set to any big&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>fans.</p>
