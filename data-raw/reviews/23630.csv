<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is fairly large, considering the amount of pieces. &nbsp;On the front it shows a big pile of all the parts, and on the back it gives a list of all the pieces, and images of the 8 models and 10 inspiration&nbsp;models to build.</p>

<p>The instructions are composed of 2 books. &nbsp;Book 1 gives you the instructions to building the minifigures&nbsp;and the models. &nbsp;But unlike your typical instruction book, this one shows you how to complete all 8 models in chunks. &nbsp;In other words, several mini-models that can connect together to build one scene. &nbsp;It shows you how to build these individual &quot;chunks&quot; in Book 2. &nbsp;So for example, you would build a chunk of terrain using Book 2, then connect it to another chunk of terrain using Book 1. &nbsp;So instead of normally going from Book 1 to Book 2, you get to use Book 2, THEN Book 1. &nbsp;It sounds complicated, but it&#39;s quite easy when you open the instructions for yourself.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With 518 pieces, you can build so many things. &nbsp;Although parts are limited, your imagination can use these pieces to build anything! &nbsp;Here&#39;s a brief list of the kinds of&nbsp;pieces you get:</p>

<p>blue water/orange lava pieces/plates</p>

<p>green grass plates</p>

<p>sand pieces/plates</p>

<p>stone pieces/plates</p>

<p>dirt pieces</p>

<p>red mushrooms</p>

<p>torches</p>

<p>furnace</p>

<p>Redstone/Lapis lazuli ores</p>

<p>TNT block</p>

<p>carrot</p>

<p>bread</p>

<p>crop pieces</p>

<p>flower pieces</p>

<p>fence thing</p>

<p>wooden plank/stone brick pieces</p>

<p>glass pane clear pieces</p>

<p>iron door pieces</p>

<p>+much more!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>3 minifigures&nbsp;come with the crafting box. &nbsp;Although Brickset says there&#39;s only 2, I and the box&nbsp;include the mooshroom. &nbsp;But first I&#39;ll tell you all about Steve.</p>

<p>All Steves look the same in these 6 new minifig-scale&nbsp;sets. &nbsp;But each Steve has a unique element(s) to it. &nbsp;What&#39;s unique to THIS Steve is that he comes with a diamond pickaxe. &nbsp;Like I said in my last review on 21115 The First Night, Steve&#39;s clothing and eyes are a little bit out of color. &nbsp;Also I said that he needed a short sleeve shirt instead of long sleeve.</p>

<p>The skeleton also comes in set 21114 The Farm and 21118 The Mine. &nbsp;It has a normal skeleton body, except for the head. &nbsp;The head looks how the head of a skeleton normally looks in minecraft. &nbsp;It&#39;s a white cube, with 2 black lines for the eyes, a gray line for the nose, and a long black line that spans the equal width of the eyes. &nbsp;The skeleton is armed with a bow. &nbsp;The only things I would change are the arms. &nbsp;They are bent slightly. &nbsp;In Minecraft, the arms are straight so that they can stick straight out and shoot arrows at the player, who in this case is Steve. &nbsp;The issue is not a big deal, but you can swap arms if you have straight white &quot;arm&quot; pieces that can attach to the torso.</p>

<p>The final minifigure that Brickset disregarded is the mooshroom. &nbsp;Appearing in Minecraft&nbsp;as a cow that is red instead of brown, has red 3 mushrooms on its back and head, larger eyes, and gives you mushroom stew instead of milk, this is the only PASSIVE mob of Minecraft&nbsp;that does not exist in real life; chickens, cows, sheep, pigs, squids, villagers(humans count), bats, ocelots, horses, donkeys, cats, dogs, and rabbits&nbsp;all exist in the physical world. &nbsp;Anyway, back to the mooshroom, it has the same new head mold as the cow, sheep, pig, and spider minifigures. &nbsp;Like the cow, the mooshroom has the same white patterns as it. &nbsp;It also has the same utters. &nbsp;However, there are obvious differences, like the different colored skin, and that the mooshroom has 2 red mushrooms on it&#39;s back and the cow doesn&#39;t. &nbsp;The only thing I would&#39;ve changed is adding a 3rd red mushroom on it&#39;s head. &nbsp;The typical adult mooshroom in Minecraft has 3 red mushrooms on its body: 2 on its back(which LEGO included), and 1 on the top of&nbsp;its head. &nbsp;If they&#39;d also added horns to the side of its head, that would make this mooshroom complete.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You can build absolutely anything in this set. &nbsp;I built a small tower over a mushroom biome. &nbsp;It didn&#39;t take that long, even though I was flipping back and forth through the books. &nbsp;Making the chunks was fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There are 8 models to build that the instructions give you. &nbsp;1 is a crop/flowerland&nbsp;with an oak tree and running water. &nbsp;2 is a fort I guess with a couple trees and a cropland and a beach. &nbsp;3 is an area of running water and lava in a grass/sand biome. &nbsp;4 is the one I built, a mushroom biome with an area of running water and a little structure with a furnace. &nbsp;There is also some cropland. &nbsp;5 is a grass/sand biome with running water, cropland, and weird oak plank structures with water in them. &nbsp;6 is a biome with a stone structure with an iron door. &nbsp;7 is a tower in a grass biome with an iron door, and the little structure from the one I built at the top. &nbsp;Finally, 8 looks like a cave sort-of thing with a sophisticated entrance. &nbsp;Within the &quot;cave&quot; are lapis lazuli and redstone ores, with a magma pit and water area. &nbsp;But you can build absolutely whatever you want in this awesome set!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion is that this set is AWESOME! &nbsp;TOTALLY worth the money! &nbsp;This set is really really a must-have for Minecrafters and more!</p>
