<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box itself is very heavy and deep.&nbsp;On the back it displays the functions of the set along with pictures of Steve&nbsp;doing a variety of things&nbsp;in and around his hut. When you open the box there are&nbsp;3 bags of pieces, a large plate and an instruction book. The instructions are thick and are very clear. It also gives you inspiration to &quot;build your own creations&quot;, although these&nbsp;are not very true to the game.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a very good selection of parts in this set and I&#39;m sure there will be some&nbsp;people who buy it&nbsp;just&nbsp;for the pieces. The crafting table, wooden sword, pickaxe&nbsp;,axe and furnace pieces are &nbsp;all new and VERY game-accurate.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The 3&nbsp;minifigs in this set look as true to the game as Lego could make them. I expect that the creeper was very hard to design... My favorite&nbsp;minifig in the set is the creeper.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This build is quite straight&nbsp;forward but a fun little build&nbsp;all the same. Very&nbsp;easy compared to the Parisian cafe :-)&nbsp; Probably ok for 6+ years.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks very nice and is packed with neat features and game-accurate details.&nbsp;But&nbsp;the size and design&nbsp;of the house&nbsp;is&nbsp;not what the average&nbsp;Minecrafter would make&nbsp;on his or her first night. &nbsp;Most players would run out of time and resources before the sun set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is great for Minecraft&nbsp;and Lego fans alike. Even toy collectors will like this set because it will probably sell out very quickly in stores. I hope this review&nbsp;helped you choose your next Lego set.</p>

<p>This set is great for a first Minecraft set, which is why I got this one first. &nbsp;Don&#39;t let the title deceive you. &nbsp;There are a few issues with the set, but overall this looks like what a Minecraft player would build in the first day of mining and crafting in order to survive the first night.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was bigger than I thought it would be, which was a good sign considering that bigger boxes mean bigger sets. &nbsp;It showed all of the function that this set had.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With 408 pieces, this set was divided into 3 or 4 bags(I don&#39;t remember exactly). &nbsp;As I was looking at some of the pieces, like the crafting table pieces and furnace and stone brick/oak plank parts, I saw all of the detail on them.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>3 minifigures(not micro thank god) come with this set. &nbsp;Steve, who is the default skin in Minecraft, has his usual cyan shirt(although it looked more light blue) with blue pants(though they look more dark purplish-blue) and a happy smile. &nbsp;He comes with 3 weapons: a wooden sword(shown on the front of the box), wooden axe(to chop down trees), and a wooden pickaxe(for mining stone). &nbsp;The only things I would change about Steve are the hues of his clothing, and the color of his eyes. &nbsp;In this set and others, his eyes are a blackish-purple haze instead of blue like they are in the game. &nbsp;The final thing I would change about Steve is the arms. &nbsp;In Minecraft, Steve has a short-sleeve shirt on, which means some skin is visible. &nbsp;LEGO could&#39;ve done this with Steve AND the zombie from 21113 The Cave &amp; 21118 The Mine. &nbsp;This was possible, because they did shorten the sleeves of Bart and Homer Simpson from 71006 The Simpsons House. &nbsp;Hopefully in future Minecraft sets, LEGO will fit Steve with shorter sleeves.</p>

<p>The creeper, who&#39;s face is the main symbol of Minecraft, is another minifigure in this set. &nbsp;With no arms, this hostile mob is the first to appear in the dusk of the first night in a new world. &nbsp;With unposeable legs,&nbsp;&nbsp;this green walking bomb isn&#39;t great for posing as if appearing to stand in one place. &nbsp;It looks as if it&#39;s always walking, because that&#39;s how the stubby legs were made. &nbsp;The creeper comes with 1 weapon, and that&#39;s itself. &nbsp;What I would&#39;ve changed about the creeper is to incorporate the pixelation&nbsp;of Minecraft into this mob, as it looks in the game. &nbsp;I also would&#39;ve made its legs poseable in different ways.</p>

<p>Finally there&#39;s the pig. &nbsp;Although Brickset doesn&#39;t consider the pig a minifigure, the box and I do. &nbsp;Being stubby in looks, this minifigure is Steve&#39;s &quot;untamed&nbsp;pet,&quot; for you cannot tame pigs in Minecraft. &nbsp;You can ride them with saddles, but cannot tame them to sit, stand, and attack mobs. &nbsp;Pigs cannot fight in combat, so it doesn&#39;t come with any weapons. &nbsp;What I would change about the pig is its hue: it comes in the set a carnation pink, whereas in the game it&#39;s much darker.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took 65 minutes for me to complete. &nbsp;It was fun, though! &nbsp;It was as if Steve was building his house! &nbsp;I was surprised but happy to see that there were no stickers included, which meant that every detail colored detail on the pieces were printed!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is VERY fragile! &nbsp;If you pick it up from 1 end, another section comes apart. &nbsp;It looks great though! &nbsp;You build the terrain around his house(which in this case is grass) with a few flowers here and there and an oak tree!</p>

<p>Steve&#39;s house has an attached wooden fence on the side(with a fence gate) where Steve can keep his pig. &nbsp;There are glass windows all around, and what amazed me the most was the stone and stone brick features on the perimeter of the house. &nbsp;TRULY amazing what LEGO did with that! &nbsp;In the front of the house, there&#39;s a wooden door that Steve can use to go in and out of his house. &nbsp;Inside, there&#39;s a crafting table, large chest, bed, furnace, and some wooden plank detail. &nbsp;Right next to his bed on the wall is an area to hang the wooden pickaxe. &nbsp;The set also comes with a long piece of bread, which can be put in the large chest, as well as 2 torches, 1 for outside &amp; 1 for inside. &nbsp;What could be better about the torches is if they lit up like the ender crystals from 21117 The Ender Dragon.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion on this set is 4/5 stars. &nbsp;The reason I didn&#39;t give it the 5th star is because of all the bad things I mentioned. &nbsp;But 4/5 stars is&nbsp;great!&nbsp; It&#39;s not excellent, but it could be better.</p>
