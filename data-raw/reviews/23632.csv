<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The box art is very nice. &nbsp;It has the trademark creeper face and a grassy outline. &nbsp;The background of the picture shows a regular forest biome with its typical oak trees. &nbsp;It also shows a river being the runoff of the farm&#39;s irrigation system.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The instructions are good, and have no errors. &nbsp;The inside of the instructions have helpful&nbsp;areas that show you what parts are needed for that step instead of having you examine the picture for the needed parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The set does actually feature some neat parts. &nbsp;The printed crafting table is one of them. &nbsp;It has an okay&nbsp;print on the top, but ugly and sloppy print on the sides. &nbsp;The green and blue baseplates are good, and could definitely be used as grass and water in MOCs. &nbsp;The carrot, stalks, chest, bread, and flower stalk pieces are interesting, but none are exclusive to this set. &nbsp;The new head pieces for humanoid and animal mobs are new.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The skeleton is cool, and I&#39;m glad Lego didn&#39;t try to make it too square. &nbsp;They used the typical skeleton body and legs, along with the arms from Ninjago skeletons. The bow that the skeleton is holding is not the original bow, and it has a cubic design.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Steve is not wearing any armor. &nbsp;I would have expected him to be wearing a leather tunic and cap. &nbsp;Steve&#39;s head can be interchanged for the pumpkin that is growing in his farm. &nbsp;Steve is holding a wooden shovel, and I really wish he also had a wooden hoe. &nbsp;That would have probably made this set &nbsp;perfect.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sheep is exclusive to this set at the moment.&nbsp; It&nbsp;has a 2x3 size, not including the head. &nbsp;It uses notched beige 1x2s&nbsp;for its legs. &nbsp;The printing on the face looks pretty good, and a&nbsp;lot like it does in Minecraft.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cow is also exclusive to this set at the moment. &nbsp;It has a 2x4 size, not including the head. It too uses notched 1x2s&nbsp;for its legs, but in brown. &nbsp;The face looks utterly just like it does in Minecraft.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build<strong>/craft</strong></h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The build is not too lengthy, and the only tedious and repetitive part is when you have to craft&nbsp;10 fence posts. &nbsp;Placing down the finishing touch of the birch tree gives a sense of accomplishment, and then your farm is done!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The completed farm looks very nice, and looks like something you would see in Minecraft. &nbsp;There is a tree for the skeleton to hide under, and the farm and animal pen both look great. &nbsp;Everything could be crafted in just one Minecraft day, and every part looks like its patron block.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, the set is great, and it all looks like it would in Minecraft. &nbsp;The set has everything it needs. (all except for that wooden hoe.) &nbsp;This set would be great paired up with the First Night. &nbsp;I would recommend this set to anyone who&#39;s built a farm in Minecraft.</p>

<p>The parts are good most of the time for Minecraft sets. The price is reasonable for what&#39;s included. The playability doesn&#39;t offer much. The building experience was terrible as the build was&nbsp;not stable and is currently&nbsp;broken for me.</p>
