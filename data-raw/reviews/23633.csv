"MicDobbe","2014-11-08T11:29:30.09Z","Great set for the lovers of Minecraft & Lego","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is bigger than you would expect a set of 249 pieces, mainly because there are a lot of 2-high blocks.</p>

<p>Instruction book shows the &#39;regular build&#39; and also gives you inspiration on how to adjust and rebuild your structure.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A great variaty of parts are included, blue, orange and gray&nbsp;base plates. Also black is used to represent obsidian and orange bricks (with a few translucent orange) are used to represent lava.</p>

<p>Lots of light gray&nbsp;2-highs, some 2x2x2&nbsp;brown parts which come with&nbsp;a jumper-tile in a green color.</p>

<p>Also included are 4 printed TNT 1x2x2 parts.</p>

<p>To make the ores (and represent either water of lava in the bucket)&nbsp;1x1x1 rounds are used in various colors.</p>

<p>Also included: chest with bread, iron pickaxe, torch mini builds, bucket and a ladder.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>For the minifigures Steve is included without armor, a zombie and as a build-minifigure a spider is included.</p>

<p>For the minifigure-heads an all new piece was made, also for the spider-head a strange new part was made.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very enjoyable, taking average time for a 249 part set.</p>

<p>The best thing about it is that you can change it however you want, and easily combine it with other sets.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">itself is very nice, it shows lots of different &#39;parts&#39; about the cave which you may encounter in&nbsp;</span>Minecraft<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">: ores (iron/gold/coal/red stone), lava, water, dirt and chests.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">What is very </span>satisfying is that no stickers were used and everything you see is printed !</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very nice set for those who love both Minecraft and Lego, it isn&#39;t pixel-perfect but that would require a lot more pieces (hence upping the price).</p>

<p>If you are in doubt about whether to buy any of the Minifig-Scale sets, start with this one and you&#39;ll be convinced !</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is rectangular and quite small in size. The front of the box shows the set in all its glory in a Minecrafty&nbsp;back ground and also states to &quot;build your own creations&quot; and that inspiration is included.&nbsp;The back of the box shows Steve&nbsp;mining ores, running away from a&nbsp;zombie and creating obsidian. It also shows the alternative model which&nbsp;is at least more game accurate&nbsp;than &quot;The First Night&quot;. The box also shows the ores included&nbsp;with the set along with the TNT. When you open the box there are 2 bags of pieces and an&nbsp;instruction book. The instructions are bigger than most people would expect and are very clear.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are lots of good parts in this set including the bread, the bucket, the chest, the iron pick and many more. My favorite is the spider&#39;s head.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs in this set are very game accurate and look good. My favorite&nbsp;is the spider.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very quick and easy but fun. I would say that a 6 year old could make it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model when made looks very much like the typical cave that you would go in when you play Minecraft. The removable iron,&nbsp;coal, gold and red stone ores look very good. you also get torches, TNT&nbsp;and a chest. The lava is very good and looks just like it does&nbsp;in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a must have for Christmas&nbsp;but it is selling out quick in the stores. Ultimately&nbsp;whether&nbsp;you like Lego or Minecraft or both you have got to have this in your collection.</p>

These were microbuilds, eventually though LEGO came to realize the sheer ability for profit that Minecraft represents. And so we now have LEGO Minecraft as an official Theme. I am not a Minecraft fan, I have never played the game and know next to nothing about the elements of the game, however I am a fan of creative LEGO ideas and while Minecraft might not be the most original of ideas, when you consider some of the Classic LEGO sets that are designed and created each day, however if you&rsquo;re a fan of brick building than this Theme is definitely for you.</span></span></span></span></p>

LEGO Minecraft isn&rsquo;t new, the design of these boxes matches those found with the LEGO Cuusoo/Ideas Minecraft Microbuild sets. The box has a nice pixelated look, all green, except the bottom flap that is brown. It is designed to match the game and it works brilliantly, the front shows the set and gives you a list of the characters found inside, the back shows off all the various ores you build and the alternative build of the model found in the back of the book. Great box design, good job LEGO.</span></span></span></span></p>

They are very well designed, considering that this is mostly using 2x4 bricks, the simple nature and design of these instructions really impress. On top of that we also get a throwback to truly Classic LEGO sets of the distant past, Rebuild Inspiration is found in the back, showcasing an alternate configuration for the Cave. There&rsquo;s even some nice artwork and a small write-up detailing what Minecraft is (for those of us who don&rsquo;t follow the game or its popularity), as well as a nice showcase of the other sets from the wave.</span></span></span></span></p>

To that end I can&rsquo;t say that there&rsquo;s anything rare in this set. We have some nice printed 1x2 bricks with TNT on them and a bagette piece first used in LEGO CMF, still most Minecraft sets are a great source for bricks, so make excellent parts packs for MOC fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

This version of Steve is found commonly in many sets, the new square headpiece looks very nice, and features the most printing for the face, the torso has a small amount of printing. Accessories include a pail for carrying harvested ores and a pickaxe.</span></span></span></span></p>

The overall design of this spider is great, it&rsquo;s suitably creepy and captures the likeness from what I&rsquo;ve seen through online images quite nicely. It&rsquo;s nice to see the creative way the LEGO designers create the creatures, enemies and characters from the game.</span></span></span></span></p>

What doesn&rsquo;t make too much sense is splitting this build between two numbered bags. This build is one half of the cave, and honestly there isn&rsquo;t much to discuss here. After spending a lot of years building intricate models the simplicity of this one is its charm though. No stickers, no printed elements, just bricks and putting them together.</span></span></span></span></p>

Sometimes just building with a bunch of bricks can beat out all the Themed LEGO sets of the modern age. What&rsquo;s really fun is how you can take this model and merge it with other models in the Wave, it&rsquo;s all designed with a bit of modular thinking, meaning that The Cave, while a simple and slightly smaller model compared to others, can be attached any number of ways to other models such as The Mine or The Farm.</span></span></span></span></p>

"CrescentSky","2016-02-08T22:06:17.717Z","Don't Dig Straight Down!","<p>As I got back into Minecraft&nbsp;by buying a new account (I&nbsp;lost my old one), I thought it would be nice to buy some Minecraft sets. The sets themselves have grabbed my attention before (especially 21118 The Mine), but I had never been tempted to buy one until now, and&nbsp;it appears I picked a good one to start with!</p>

<p>&nbsp;<span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is very well detailed, covered in grass block-like printing all around, and even looks like dirt on the bottom! It also displays Steve and a zombie with some &quot;action features&quot; and an alternate build. The instructions are also well decorated, with grass block printing (again) in the background. the instructions also tell you how to build the alternate model, which is really just a slight variation of the main build.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For such a small set, some wonderful parts are included. A light nougat chest, two 1x2 white printed tnt bricks, an iron pickaxe, a light grey bucket, and special molded heads for Steve, the zombie, and the spider.&nbsp;For the price of the set, the value of the parts is astounding, and would be great for reselling online.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has two or three minifigures&nbsp;depending on how you look at it. Steve, a zombie, and a spider are included, all of which have special heads and, if applicable, torsos. Lego could have gotten away with only including Steve and the zombie, but I am very glad that the spider is included as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build of this set is split into two parts, the first of which makes most of the actual cave section and the second makes the entrance and platform on top of the cave. The first build was surprisingly in depth and more complicated than I expected, but the second was a bit under whelming. For a set this small, however, the build was surprisingly good.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>My only complaint about the model is that the sections it is built in are not very well connected. Usually they are only held together ny four studs, and I had some trouble getting it to stay together when building it and during transportation. Another small thing I would have prefered&nbsp;is the color of the gold ore to be yellow instead of golden, to better match the in-game block.&nbsp;Despite these flaws, I still am very happy with the appearance of the set as a whole.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was really surprised about how good this set turned out to be. It is a wonderful introduction to the minifig-scaled&nbsp;Minecraft sets, and would go well with any other sets in the line. I fully recommend this set to anyone interested in the Minecraft theme.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of unique pieces, such as the iron pickaxe, a light-grey bucket, two printed TNT pieces and the custom minifigure pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure collection in The Cave is good, containing Steve with his iron pickaxe, and two of the most common hostile mobs, the Zombie and the Spider.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is fine, although it can be hard to transport, unless you put a large plate under it. Steve can mine ores, as well as run away from zombies.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would recommend this set to people who either are starting up their collection, or who have The Mine, as this is practically a scaled-down version of The Mine. This set gave me a lot of fun playing it.</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2016-06-21T02:31:01.447Z","Dumb Ways to Die","<p>Hello Brickset users. Welcome again to yet another review by me. This time, we are reviewing the Cave. Overall, I &nbsp;really like this set. This is really nice. Let&#39;s jump into the review</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: The box is pretty clear, showing the set surrounding a forest biome. The instructions ar every clear and no technic parts are involved. Another wonderful upside is everything is printed instead of stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: Parts are really nice. You&nbsp;get many common colors and designs. The most striking parts to me are the ores and TNT, minifigure&nbsp;heads and accessories and torches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: Minifigures are basic for the most part. You get a zombie, which you can find in many other sets. Steve is armed with an iron pickaxe to mine the ores. This is also common, as both can be found in several other sets. The spider, however, is exclusive to this set and The Mine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The build was really easy. All I needed help on was the spider, which was a little difficult. Everything else was very straightforward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: The Cave looks like a cave. The chest is nice. The ores and the figures are a welcome inclusion. Just try not to get hurt, as there are many places where you are likely&nbsp;to die! (Just kidding!) I really like the completed model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: I think the age group is fine. I see anyone not having much of a problem with this set. This is both a great set for kids and collectors because you can act out scenes from Minecraft, or just display it and combine it with other sets to make a minecraft world. The price is really good, for only a low price of $20. I would highly recomend&nbsp;this, wheter you play the game or not.</p>

"BlobfishBricks","2020-04-28T01:10:43.44Z","Fun Set, Not a Stand-Alone","<p>This set was my second in the Lego Minecraft, and it did not disappoint me. However, I don&#39;t believe I would have enjoyed it as much had it been my first minecraft set.</p>

<h2>The Build&nbsp;</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The build was just like any other Minecraft build, not too complex. Mostly just block stacking, but still fun. There were two bags in this set.</p>

<h2>The Minifigs</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Two minifigs are included, not at all rare Steve and a Zombie. This was, however, in the first wave of Lego Minecraft, so I guess it was good for its time. The other character you get is a spider, which is still pretty good. Overall the minifigs were fair, but good for their time.</p>

<h2>The Finished Build</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When finished, the model is a pretty good size, though given the name is &ldquo;The Cave&rdquo; there isn&#39;t much cave interior. There is quite a bit of ore, including gold, coal, iron, and redstone, plus lots of stone blocks. There is also a nice lava fall, combining with a lake forming obsidian. Nothing special was made for the obsidian, unfortunately. Other than that, there is a little outside world with grass and dirt, but nothing too special. The only thing left to mention is the little shelter up top, with a little ladder leading to it. Up there is a torch and a nice chest with a loaf of bread.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Overall the set is pretty fun, and makes a nice playset. However, it seems it does not stand alone very well (I got this along with the First Night set). The lack of space is a bit disappointing, though it is a twenty dollar set. I would recommend this to anyone who already has anther minecraft set, such as The First Night.</p>
