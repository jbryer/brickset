<p>As a fan of Minecraft as well as Lego I was hyped to get one of these.</p>

<p>My local Lego store had all the Minecraft Sets already in store. Maybe it is due to the fact that they were celebrating their 1 year anniversary.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box design is awesome and the instructions are printed on a higher quality paper. Overall giving a very polished impression.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As many have already stated online the set consists mostly of basic blocks.</p>

<p>Although my only gripe is that there is a whole lot of gray tiles but I guess that is to be expected with the mine setting.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigures are awesome and very Minecrafty. Some would argue that the arms are&#39;nt blocky but I don&#39;t mind really.</p>

<p>There is Steve with iron armor, iron pickaxe and iron helmet.</p>

<p>A Creeper, a Skeleton with a bow, an awesome Spider as well as a Zombie</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was very Enjoyable for me to build as it is the first proper Set I own since quite a few years.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Oh my does it look awesome. The set offers quite some verticality. With the awesome minecart tracks it is somewhat deep too. So it looks and plays really great. With different layers to play and explore.</p>

<p>The only major gripe I have is with the chest which isn&#39;t blocky at all with its rounded curves and handles and the ladder.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this set exactly grasps the concept of Minecraft for me and translates it to Lego.</p>

<p>I do like the Minecraft Micro builds but this is something entirely different. It was well worth the high asking price for me.</p>

"D_O_S","2017-01-06T05:03:54.657Z","Greatest Lego Minecraft Set","<p>The Mine in my opinion is the best lego minecraft set currently. The minecart is a very clever and unique and creates playability. It also has some good minifigures although not exclusive, they are appropriate for the set. This set offers everything a minecraft fan could want.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>The build took three hours, though it involved a lot of stacking like all the other minecraft sets but did not feel like a chore or repetitive.</p>

<p>The Completed Model</p>

<p>The completed model was very large. It was inches across and almost a foot tall. It was plentiful in space and had&nbsp;four distinct levels which each offered surprises. The lower floor contained water and lava and a very cleverly made minecart railway. The second floor had two mine shafts and a ramp which allows the cart to tumble down as well as the home of the spider. The third floor had a chest with bread where a zombie lurks and a tnt explosion play feature. The top floor is meant to emulate the overworld and has two nice trees.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>15 by 8 by 12 inch huge build</p>

<p>minecart railway</p>

<p>plentiful space for play</p>

<p>well done minifigures and game elements</p>

<p>tnt explosion works well</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>$110 for 922 pieces (a little high)</p>

<p>hard to find</p>

<p>railway needs maintenance to optimize playability</p>

<p>One problem we encountered was that when we tried to unassemble the pieces that were still together from the previous owner, many of the 1x1 tiles broke in half.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure if this is due to the mine car putting pressure on them or not but we are going to replace them with other 1x1 round tiles we have.</p>

<p>Lots of building options and fun to play with.</p>
