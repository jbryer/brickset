"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-30T11:45:09Z","Useful","The set on its own isn't too good, but is great for any town collector, if only for the hydrant and street lamps. The gate piece is very fragile and falls over easily. The cop car isn't up to much but the tan car is nice. The thug is nice and young spidey has a very good head.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-21T21:32:09Z","Nice City Accessories","Had to pick up one of these for my train town at LSAH price of $10.  I would recommend this set at $10 for the city accessories.  I love the hydrant, two trash cans (with lids), the lamp post, and the street sign with lamp. Unfortunately, stickers are required for the street signs.  The cars are excellent except for the lack of doors and very low clearing between the car bottom and ground. I really like the spiderman vehicles (except for the lack of doors). The gate is ok and if placed on another plate (like a road plate), works well.  The set should really be worth $10 and at this price, I think its worth it. Offers playability on its own or with your city.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-08-02T07:42:37.427Z","city accessories!","i finally opened my copy of this set, and i'm pleased to find a lot of useful parts and ideas for a lego town: not only 2 individual, fully equipped cars, but also a gate, a trashcan, lamps, street signs etc. the criminal is surprisingly well dressed, spiderman has a nice torso, so there's nothing to complain about the minifigs. 
the only thing i don't understand is the gate mechanism, trying to provide playability, but failing in this regard. well, that doesn't bother me, i strongly advise to get this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"MIDAS","2010-07-10T13:59:58.99Z","A really great spider-man set!","<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Introduction</span><br></p><p>This was always one of my favourite spider-man set, and it's a shame that it's since moved on to build other things really! I got it from a friend who went to legoland in about 2004, so i can't really complain about the price at all - though it's about right I think.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Minfigs</span><br></p><p>The minifigs are all pretty cool, though i find the world city cop seems unseasonably happy for what is happening in the scene. Spider-man looks cool, it's his early outfit and it represents it fairly well. The criminal is okay, though he looks very different in the film, his outfit looks cool enough.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Main set</span><br></p><p>I do like the two cars, they're greatly detailed and it's weird that they didn't adopt this style of car building for city sets. The gate is a little clumsy, but still quite cool, and the extra bits such as the fire hydrant, street signs and cat are all great additions. It also has what i guess is the radioactive spider that started it all in trans red.</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Overall</span><br></p><p>It is a great set worth looking for online if you really want it, but i'd say a better idea would be to print of some instructions and try and build the cars with pieces from other sets, maybe in other colours for variation! You'll probably find this for between £30 and £60 online, which is a bit much for what you get, but it's a classic that's worth tracking down!&nbsp;</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pros and Cons</span><br></p><p>For the people without much time, like me, pros and cons;</p><ul><li>Quite a good looking set overall.</li><li>Nice cars and good minifigs.</li><li>A classic set!</li><li>Cat and spider both good for cities.</li><li>Same with fire hydrant and lamposts.</li><li>Gate looks cool!</li><li>Represents the scene well!<br></li></ul>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
