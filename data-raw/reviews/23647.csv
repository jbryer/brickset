<p>Now this is hardly anything to talk about, so I&rsquo;ll do a short pro/con list for sake of everyone&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Parts are interchangeable with other pens and can be customized to your liking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Waste of money unless you&rsquo;re collecting</p>

<p>-Barely compatible with system sets</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>-Junk</p>
