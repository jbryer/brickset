"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-15T13:51:21Z","Great Set","I have bought him yesterday. It is my first box with spidy (I had the little box with gr. goblin and Mary-J. already).
It is a terriffic set not only for the minifigs but also for the laboratorium things and the computers with   Windows(R) on the screens. 2 normal and one flatscreen. It is ideal to make a lab or university thing with it (with Dr. Killroy). I like it that they made so many different characters from Spiderman. They must do that a bit more with Harry Potter. The new hairpiece of Mary-Jane is also very nice (hairpiece Hermiony but Orange).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Great double-diorama piece with a nice assortment of appropriately designed minifigs. It's a wonderful set but the retail pricetag gets me cringing again as Lego cashes in heavy on the media tie-in. I lucked out big time on a clearance set. 

Good:

miniFigs:
Green Goblin has some extra helmet details, and the individual figs are excellent, accurately recreating the movie. Spidey himself is awesome, comlete with web rope that you can hang him from or use to snare the bad guys. His eye-glass-wearing alter-ego is striking as well. Mary Jane and the mad scientist are nicely figged, MJ with her new hairpiece, the scientist with a welcome new face design. Norman Osborn is included, yellow from the waist up just as he was in the transformation sequence, so at $30 retail, this set includes six figs. 

Lab Details:
For spidey's lab, the radioactive spiders in their glass box and the one hanging on the ceiling are nicely rendered, as is the overhanging screen and an elegantly simple microscope. I have dreams of turning this set into the inside of a starship.
For Goblin's lab, the computer is just incredible. I never thought Lego would pull off a flat-screen computer, but they did, and it is awesome. The door and glass window piece are nicely done and give a good sense of the scene.

Bad: 

sparseness:
The set as a double-diorama looks kind of bare, minimalist as the trend is going. I feel lucky I got a clearance price. There aren't many bricks or walls, so the minifigs and printed pieces really carry the set. 

Set gets a 8 for awesome details and minifigs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-06-07T10:38:08.03Z","excellent minifigs","this set is worth owning just because of the unique and good looking minifig torsos: the scientists tie and grey jacket, mary janes outfit, and peter parkers shirt - not available in any other set and fitting any town diorama.
the set itself consists mainly of special parts, the huge transparent glass piece being a valuable addition for your shop windows in town. 
you don't get this set cheap any more, it is very much looked for because of the features i named.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LEGOmyeggo","2007-06-12T10:08:28.857Z","WINNER! ","This is truly a winner. I adore this and I own it. It has useful pieces such as: 
-the computer monitors 
-the clear cup
-the six minifigures(Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Spider-Man, Osborne, a scientist, and Green Goblin)
-a spider collection
-a case to hold spiders in
-a big screen
-a tan balcony
-a glass window in G.G.'s lab

It is very fun to build and you can change Mr Osborn into the green goblin with a twist of your fingers. This set is top notch and worth the cost. If you are into Spiderman sets this one is a must.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Brock_the_Builder","2009-06-04T18:02:37.123Z","What Amazing Minifigs!","This is a very cool set with awesome minifigs.  It also features a lot of graphics via printed parts and stickers.  The set doesn't have any extra special tricks, aside from a prehistoric spinning mechanism similar (but less advanced) to Darth Vader Transformation.  But, it does give you two small individual playsets linked with a hinge plate, along with LOTS of minifigs.  When I was done building the set, I just sat back and marveled at the 6 people cramming the 2 small baseplates.  Perfect!  And such rare characters as well-- I love this set!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"woodall_aidan","2010-08-05T21:37:52.797Z","Very Good Spider-Man Set!","This was my first Spider-Man set. The pieces were very useful, a camera, a DNA tile, etc. It came with very rare figures: Peter Parker without the double-sided head, Mary Jane in her green jacket, a scientist, the works! I very much liked the ""LAB C35"" sign. Frankly, I liked all of the transformation lab! Spider-Man with the classic blues was a nice touch (excluding the fact that I lost it).

"AETerry","2010-11-12T22:58:32.907Z","Origins Review","<p>I managed to pull this off E-Bay at a decent price and for some reason I thought there'd be Goblin's Glider in this set... that was my real let down... not having looked at this picture close enough...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you get 6 minifigures, many of which are rare and hard to get...Green Goblin, Normon Osborne, Dr. Strom, Maryjane, Peter Parker and Spiderman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The small details of accessories and computers are just awesome to get and are what truely carry this set through. It's also very much like getting 2 sets in 1.</p>

<p>Fortunately a PDF file of another set, I can pull off creating Goblin's Glider with my&nbsp;other Legos.</p>",TRUE,3,5,3,4,5
