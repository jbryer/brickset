"mikemakesmusic","2014-07-09T21:01:52.44Z","Fun carnival related kit","<p>This kit goes great with the Fairground&nbsp;Mixer (http://shop.lego.com/en-US/Fairground-Mixer-10244)! &nbsp;It came free from the Lego Store with a qualifying purchase during the month of June 2014.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: &nbsp;Polybag with folded instructions; no surprises</p>

<p>Parts: 66&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: 2 -&nbsp;The boy has two faces: happy and sad. &nbsp;The vendor has one face, but has a beautfully printed torso front and back.</p>

<p>The build: simple</p>

<p>The completed model: elegant with a low parts count. &nbsp;A good static display in a carnival/fairground setting.</p>

<p>Overall opinion: &nbsp;I really like this little kit. &nbsp;Thanks for the gift, Lego! &nbsp;It&#39;s the perfect complement to the Fairground Mixer.</p>
