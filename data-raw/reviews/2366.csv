"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-29T19:25:35Z","Good City Bridge","Just picked this set up today. Playability (10): definately a fun set. Includes bridge, cablecar, taxi, and four figs including spiderman and the green goblin. Design (8): Creative, nicely built, and pretty sturdy. Pieces (8): good selection of pieces (mostly standard with a few specialty parts like the large cablecar/train ends (very nice)). Colors are good with nothing out of place. Price (7): a lot to pay for a bridge and cablecar, although I purchased at a reduced price. I'd like to see this set around $30. AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: Taxi is very long but only holds the driver. Ever hear of a one-seated taxi? Don't like having to use stickers for detail. The road/bridge is only wide enough for one car at a time (no trucks allowed). No way for figs to climb to the cable car.  I guess they have to jump from the bridge?  The rail that the cable car hangs from 2-studs wide has the rail piece on one side but could have had 1 x 8/10/12s on the other side for additional support. Beige 2x4x3's? Just give us 3 standard Lego bricks.  LIKES: I bought this more for the bridge but the cable car is really neat and works pretty well.  Sewer drains on the bridge are a nice detailed addition.  Good ideas on back of box. This set doesn't even need to be associated with SpiderMan. It's a neat set with/without the association to the movie. Overall: 8.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-03T04:02:16Z","The second best set of the Spider-Man theme","This one comes off second best after the Hideout IMO. I expected it to have more parts - 355 is not enough for 70 euros! Still, this is a great model with the green goblin and his glider the cabin car and the two-faced M.J..
They should have kept closer to the original Queensborogh Bridge,though or at least made the bridge's pilons higher.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-06-07T10:56:13.217Z","impressive bridge","from the view of aan adult fan of lego, this set may contain too many big parts, but taking the perspective of a kid (for whom this toy may have been produced ;-) ), the set ist just great: very stable, with an actually working cable car (that also provides a cool train front), and a street on which cars can roll down from the bridge.
the only unique minifig here is mary jane with a very fancy white combination. a nice touch with a double meaning are the brick-stickers.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-01T23:08:29.13Z","Incy Wincy Spider","There's a lot of good things going for this set - the working cable car for starters, a bridge that actually looks nice, a taxi and of course spiderman.  The not so good things - the bridge only has one lane and most of the set is taken up by large pieces, reducing the piece count.  Still, that doesn't detract from the overall set design.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-10T02:42:42.28Z","The cable car will actually cross the bridge","Great mini figures(4) Spiderman, Green Goblin, Cab driver and Mary Jane. Unique pieces to build the bridge, roadway to make the bridge span (cool). The only slight fault is the Taxi seems a little to long and almost out of proportion, but its a Taxi!! Once set is completed the set is about two feet in length. Great set worth the investment..",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"spyder38","2008-08-24T14:35:50.14Z","uggghhh!","very juniorized, only good pieces are goblin's glider's 3 purple pieces and spideys web don't get it! the bridge can only fit one car- the lame taxi. the only reason i gave it a 2 is cuz of the pieces i mentioned, and lego finally came out with a taxi. lame, but still a taxi. and stickers are used where printed pieces could have been.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"LEGOmyeggo","2009-06-14T18:10:25.14Z","One nifty set. ","This set is very nifty and cool because you can turn a crank on the top of the bridge to cause the Roosevelt Island lift to move on the cable from either side of the bridge. It is also neat in the fact that it includes the Green Goblin with his flying machine thing, Spider-Man, Mary Jane, a taxi with a driver, and a bridge. However, the bridge is very short in its length and so I expanded the bridge to make it longer but now the cable car can not move next to the bridge anymore. 
Anyways, besides this fact it is a great set that I realized when I received it as a birthday gift-but is not worth $50 USD for sure!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"keithyw","2008-12-11T00:03:22.047Z","Useful Set","One of the big pluses of many of the Spider-Man sets was the ability to adapt it to your town.  This set in particular gave us three pretty unique elements to the town system: a taxi, cable car and bridge.  For myself (and probably other avid town collectors), these elements add a good amount of detail to a large metropolitan type of city, even without the Green Goblin and Spider-Man figures.

I don't really have too many issues with the size of the pieces.  But I do have an issue with the taxi, which is somewhat useless because it doesn't seem to be able to hold more than one figure (what good is a taxi if you can't put other people in it?).  Second, there's absolutely no way that people can come down from the cable car.  Of course, that was Mary Jane's plight in the movie, but here you don't need the Green Goblin's presence to make her life difficult!

I do appreciate the look and feeling of the set though.  My personal purpose for purchasing this set wasn't for the Spider-Man nor Green Goblin elements, but the additional town elements.

"TheDarkKnight","2008-12-11T08:18:51.217Z","Awesome Spidey Set!","This is a nice Spidey set! This is really awesome, and takes a little while to build.

Pros:
Spider-Man minifigure (duh!).
Green Goblin.
Mary-Jane.
TAXI!
Taxi Driver.
Spider-web
Cable Car (actually moves by turning-handle).
The Bridge! It takes a good while to build (yay!) and the &quot;lights&quot; on top really set it off!

Cons:
Cable car disconnects easily
GG's glider is pretty.... small.
Stickers

This is a GREAT set! If you have the money, I STRONGLY suggest you take it and get a hold of this et on eBay or some such other website.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"RacersFreak","2011-02-09T00:43:17.657Z","Hmm,","This is a very strange set. Firstly when i tried to find this set it was like trying to find a Ghost. I had no idea where it was, it didn't seem to be anywhere and i didn't even know if it was being sold. Secondly when i finally did get this set i noticed i said on the side of the Box; Made in Korea ... Huh? Omg LEGO is supposed to be made in Denmark. I mean yes the 2004 line of LEGO strangely enough did have a lot of sets saying Made in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland, Germany, Korea, China or the Czech Republic and with the Korean or China lettering near the end resembling that the Box or Packaging was made in Korea or China, But this was all made in Korea! Wow that was just strange. I mean i knew from that point that the Quality wasn't going to be very good, because those European Manufactures in Denmark, Czech Republic, Sweden ... are Number 1! when it comes to Quality, but Made in Korea it was bound not to be as good. Anyway i put that to the back of my head and started to build when ... <br>I opened the set up to find all the pieces were really greasy! Omg, the pieces were in Brand New Sealed Plastic Bags and there Greasy my God what is this Korean LEGO company doing... No wonder LEGO stopped there contract with Kora in 2005! I mean it was disgusting, all the pieces felt slimy and wet it was horrific! Anyway i started building it with the hope i wouldn't get some disease and just kept building until i finished the Taxi when ...<br>Omg i realized the design is so UGLY! I mean the designers at this Korean LEGO company were insane! Not only that but the Mini-figs were really greasy to and the Printed elements on there face didn't look very good. I also found the Bridge useless ans small and very UGLY!<br><br>Wow besides that the Tram thing is OK, however it doesn't work that well and makes the entire things wobble, anyway get this set if you want...but be warned!<br>",TRUE,2,5,2,4,2
