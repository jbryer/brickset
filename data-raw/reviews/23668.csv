"Tar_Domo","2014-09-01T14:39:42.667Z","A Great Book For Lego SW Collectors","<p>This book has great information about LEGO sets and also nice pictures. The exclusive old-stylish Luke minifigure&nbsp;is a great extra with his yellow head and nice printings. It&acute;s a minifigure for LEGO SW collectors but I think also kids like it as a &quot;funny extra&quot;.</p>

<p>In my opinion the best part of the book is the timeline where you can find all the LEGO SW products released from 1999 to 2014 though it has not all the 2014 summer sets. It also tells from what Episode the sets are.</p>

<p>After that it tells information about Anakin theme sets and Podrace theme sets and so on. In my opinion it could focus more also on the older sets.</p>

<p>After the set information with themes it has a minifigure gallery. It is a nice add but I&acute;m pretty sure there are not all the minifigures. I even have some that I can&acute;t find there but it&acute;s still funny to compare there the old and new characters. (Personally I like a lot of the old ones better).</p>

<p>It&acute;s a good book for LEGO SW collectors to have.</p>

It shows the most recent sets of Star Wars™ Ships up to about mid 2014 and it shes which sets came before it. I love looking through this book and compare the older sets to newer ones and thinking about which sets they should remake. The minifigure that comes with it is an updated version of the original Luke Skywalker from 1999 and it is great. It looks like the original but it now his back printing. This is a great book for fans and collectors alike. I would highly recommend if you like to look back at what was and think about what could be.",TRUE,5,4,2,2,3
"Minifig290","2018-10-06T23:14:08.767Z","144 Pages Of Great SW Info","<p>Hello all, Today i&rsquo;ll be looking at the 2014 LEGO Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary: Updated And Expanded that retailed for &pound;16.99. This book has two items to be excited about firstly the Awesome book that offers a great read and secondly the Luke Skywalker Minifigure who is exclusive.</p>

<p>Let me brief&nbsp;this awesome book and look at the&nbsp;figure (NO SPOILERS)</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Included with this book is an awesome exclusive Luke Skywalker in his Tatooine wear, this figure made to represent one of the first Star Wars characters as he has a yellow skin tone. His yellow head has the simple black dotted eyes with eyebrows and a line for a mouth. Luke torso is a slightly redesigned version of the 1999 figure, it&rsquo;s printed on a white torso showing his shirt with a belt that holds his lightsaber&nbsp;and has some creases&nbsp;which where absent on the original. His legs are printed on a tan pair showing his trousers, the hip part is white. Finally his hair is a classic undetailed&nbsp;hair in tan that the original Luke from 1999 had. Sadly the figure has no accessories.</p>

<p><strong>Book</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to brief each chapter.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 0: Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The first 10 or so pages has the Contents an Introduction and a awesome recap of every Star Wars set (including Polybags) ever made from 1999 to June 2013 from Micro Fighters to UCS to Planet&nbsp;Series and even the Midi-scale sets.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 1: Prequel Trilogy &amp; Clone Wars</strong></p>

<p>Pages 16-57 are full of LEGO Prequel Trilogy and Clone Wars sets and figures and facts about each vehicle and minifigures. Page 34 is dedicated to the Republic Gunship that tells the reader about the 2013 set but also has some info on the two previous versions from 2008 and 2002.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 2: Orginal&nbsp;Trilogy and Expanded Universe</strong></p>

<p>Pages 69-97 are like chapter 1 full of info but about the Original Trilogy and Expanded Universe. Page 66-67 are dedicated to the UCS Millennium Falcon from 2008 that has a ton of detail about the sets features and detail, but doesn&rsquo;t have any info on the 2004 or 2012 versions as they are on a previous page. Pages 70-71 has the Death Star and Pages 76-77 has the 2006 and 2014 Play scale Star Destroyer&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 3:&nbsp;Specialist Set</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike previous chapters, chapter 3 is about a mixture of sets from UCS, Planet Sets etc, It takes up pages 100-117 making it the shortest chapter. Pages 104-107 are about all the Mini Sets (Mostly Polys). Pages 110-115 are full of different UCS sets over the years (1999-2014)</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4: Beyond the Brick</strong></p>

<p>Lastly the final chapter is about all the designers of Star Wars sets and how they mold parts, design sets and also has a prototype of a unreleased Self-Propelled Heavy Artillery Walker. Also this chapter has the Merchandise of LEGO Star Wars like Watches and Magnets also 124-125 is about all the Promotional items like Comic Con sets and extremely rare figures. Page 126-127 has MOCs&nbsp;and Page 128-129 are about the LEGO Star Wars games.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 5.2: Minifigure Gallery</strong></p>

<p>Finally for real the last few pages of the book have a Minifigure&nbsp;Gallery that shows every Star Wars Minifigure&nbsp;ever made and a Index and Acknowledgements. Pages 130-141 have over 800 figures.</p>

<p>_______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude my review of the Star Wars Visual Dictionary, i&rsquo;d recommend this to any LEGO Star Wars fan without a doubt, It&rsquo;s full of great detail and the figure is a nice inclusion. I&rsquo;ve giving this a low Playability and Build rating for obvious reasons of this being a book and not really a set, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean this is a terrible book as it was&nbsp;the best LEGO&nbsp;Star Wars book when it came out.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Best boom of its time based on LEGO Star Wars, Decent price, Well detailed redesign if a iconic figure&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Wished the Luke Figure had a accessory like a lightsaber</p>
