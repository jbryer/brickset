"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-30T18:37:04Z","There are some great components here but the overall set idea is lame.","I bought this set 06-29-2004 and put it together the same day.  It is easy to assemble.  The jewel thieves are nice but the best part of the set is the street lamp with the street signs!  The set includes a nicely done brown rat that would be more at home in set 4855 Spider-Man's (Subway) Train Rescue than on the streets of lower Manhattan.  The &quot;Diamond Store&quot; is rather lame as is the ramp in the middle of the street.  The fire hydrant that you build is a cute touch.  One thief is trying to escape on a Spidey decorated skateboard. This is so ridiculous that I gave the board to Spider-Man instead.  The other is trying to escape on a three-wheeled motorscooter with 2 jewels mounted where a seat should be.  This is so dumb that I put all 3 provided jewels into the first thief's backpack and have the first thief ride behind the second one since it makes more sense to flee the robbery on a motorscooter than a skateboard.  In summary, the set is definitely worth the money because it provides great components (Spider-Man, 2 thieves, rat, fire hydrant, street lamp &amp; signs, skateboard, motorscooter) even if the overall set idea comes across as rather silly looking.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-20T21:45:31Z","Not too bad","I got this set for my birthday and wouldn't have bought it otherwise, but I don't really mind it. The crooks are cool (except one of them has a spider man skateboard and the other has spiderman decoration on his jacket). When you consider that it only costs $17 Australian, you'll realise that it's quite detailed.

The bank is well done considering they probably only had a few pieces to work with the keep the price down. The jewels are cool, the lamp post and street signs are great but the overall idea of the set is somewhat lacking. I give this a seven because I've considered the many young children for whom this set will be great and begin many Lego adventures that they'll have.

"hustla187","2008-07-17T20:30:28.733Z","Could Be Better","This is a really weak set. The diamond store could be much better. The lampost is cool for any city. The ramp is kind of cheesy and useless. The skateboard is cool but not with a Spider Sticker. The 3 wheeler is OK but Lego makes too many of them. I can give this set a 3.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legoguysw","2008-09-06T07:01:23.793Z","Surprisingly, it is really good!","I'm serious! This doesn't appear in the film, but like i said in the Indy 4 camp set review, Lego needed a small scene to make into a set. So, they created a new one.
There are 3 minifigures in this set, Spidey, Bank Robber one, with a rather large backpack, and Bank robber 2, with a trike. Nice figures, with useless faces considering they are fleshie.
The bank is pretty good considering it is in a tiny set. Lego worked well on this, using the pieces they had to create a good looking building. Nice use of the ladder piece as a cage, and the tan parts are uselful, as is the dome for the diamond. The are 3 in the set, blue red and green. 2 fit on the back of the trike.
There is a fire hydrant, well made, a rat, and a good sign and lamp.
The ramp is nice, people say it is out of place, but it could be being used for roadworks or something! Use your imaginations people!
I don't know why the robber has a spiderman skatebord. We should just be glad there is a rare piece like this here!
Overall, 5 stars *****, a great set with good pieces, a good design, and good idea.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
