I was sceptical due to its obvious similarity not only to the arctic helicrane but also to the coast guard helicopter and the cargo heliplane. However, I was wrong; this is a great set, with enough significant differences to make it not only worth while, but also with the addition of the small H&auml;gglunds or whatever you want to call it - awesome. That I love those orange parts is just the icing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I say again: orange. Opinions on those special parts vary, especially when it comes to cockpits and such; given the ease and frequencies that my kids give every arctic figure a go in piloting I have come to like them. Why the plane body cover parts had to be single parts I do not entirely understand, but apart from that I don&#39;t complain. Did I say orange?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I do think that those arctic minifigs are somewhat redundant, but given that they might disappear in a year or so I don&#39;t complain. I wouldn&#39;t have minded a fourth fig given size and prize of the set though.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Straightforward, and, as most planes slightly repetitive, you do note the similarities to the forementioned similar plane/heli types. It is worth noting though that all those small H&auml;gglunds crawlers are slightly different in build, which I thought was fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>First of all I want to point out that the playability is enormous: Your crawler comes with a sledge and a supply pod on it, that you can move back and forth into the back-loadable plane. Needless to say that they are compatible to all other Arctic sledging devices, which enables the creation of longer supply trains if you own them. The easy-access cockpits are awesome, though have become somewhat standard. The two large rotatable turboprop engines and the ski landing gear complete the ice pilot supply feeling. I love it, the kids love it, what more do you want. Maybe one more minifig or so :p</p>

<p>I do not understand why LEGO has not included this great set into the &#39;regular&#39; row of Arctic releases this year. This might also explain the price; the rest, I blame on the orange.</p>
