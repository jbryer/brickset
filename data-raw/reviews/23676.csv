<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is quite big for it&#39;s size. It comes in several unnumbered bags.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No special parts. All general parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One Minifigure. Generic painter with a brush and a bucket. This set also comes with one spare brush.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was a little tedious at first as the parts are very similar, only differing in length.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is practical as it it a storage box but you can&#39;t really put too many things inside. You may want to avoid storing sharp objects too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The 2 storage boxes are stackable and they lie on too of each other separated by a smooth tile piece. I may buy one more set just to stack them up.&nbsp;</p>
