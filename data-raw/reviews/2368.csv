"ratz","2007-10-18T11:46:38.03Z","another fine spider-man release!","how come these spider-man sets are even better than genuine city-sets? this one is a perfect example: you get cars, a trike, a load of minifigs, and the small facade piece inspires to build the whole house. not to mention the small bits like tree, money etc.
that's more than you could ask for, so in spite of all criticism one has to admit that some people at lego have their bright moments :-).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"AETerry","2010-08-13T13:39:26.397Z","Doc Ock's Bank Robbery Review","<p>To begin with, this set is largely a reenactment of the Bank Heist scene from Spiderman 2. It's fun to have. And for $20, you do get a wide number of minifigures, one of whom is exclusive to this set and comparatively cheap ways to get a couple other figures. I am largely disappointed by the set as it's mostly just a facade front for the bank and not much else going on for it.<br></p><h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions like many LEGO sets are in booklet form with clear, easy to follow step-by-step illustrations.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 174 pieces to this, making it a good value for the $20 on the price per piece. Notable pieces are the glass windows for the bank, spider-man's web line and parts for building the bank vault.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>As stated before, you get five minifigures in all. Two Security or Police minifigures, Aunt May (and this is the only set to get her in just about), Doc Ock and Spider-man. Well worth it for three of them.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>Overall, I'm still disappointed in this set as a whole. And it's mainly with the bank itself as it feels too much like a facade and there's not a whole lot of interior detail or even a bank teller for it.</p><p>You do get a tri-wheel motorcycle, police or security car, a vault that Doc Ock can rip out of the walls and tree for some scenery.</p><p>So in the end with it being a facade, it just feels way too simple or unrealized concept.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As a medium range set, I feel in many ways this set does fall short of actual build. Minifigures wise, you've got your bang for your buck with the number, rare figure, Spider-man and Doc Ock. If I wanted an actual bank set to place in a LEGO town or city, this wouldn't be it, not unless I really on to it. The licensed name and movie tie-in are the key selling points to this set and for that, it can still be very decent.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
