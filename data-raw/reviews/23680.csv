"Dragon_Master_48","2014-12-26T03:12:06.41Z","Mighty MTT Rolls Into Battle","<p><strong>75058 MTT&nbsp;</strong>is the third non-mini&nbsp;version of the Star Wars Trade&nbsp;Federation Multi-Troop Transport (MTT). From its appearance alone, I prefer it over 7184 from 2000; however, as I am unfamiliar with 7662 from 2007, I cannot judge this set in regards to the previous one. Thus, I will evaluate it upon its own merits.</p>

<p>The MTT itself is very large and study. Several panels of the MTT can fold out for storage- overall, there are two panels for spring-loaded shooters, two on either side for blaster storage or the PK-4 Droid, two on either side for the pilot, one in the back for a STAP, and one in the front for carrying the droids. One complaint I had was the lack of space for the droids: only six can fit given the current build. Although I wonder if the build could have been optimized to hold more droids, given the current length and height of the MTT, it&#39;s a fairly reasonable amount (although still not amount I would have preferred).</p>

<p>Despite having a few mixed-up pages in my instruction manual, I enjoyed the build very much. Not counting the Battle Droids, I enjoyed the minifigure selection in this set. Both the Obi-Wan Kenobi&nbsp;and Qui Gon Jinn minifigures are superb and a welcome addition to any Phantom Menace set. The Naboo&nbsp;Security Guard is also a good addition to the heroes&#39; forces. The PK-4 droid is fairly interesting, although I would have rathered a Droideka.</p>

<p>The MTT is fun to roll along the ground, and with the included minifigures, you can stage a fairly large battle. The included STAP is very stable on its base, and is quite swooshable.</p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul style=""font-size: medium;"">
	<li>Great playability.</li>
	<li>Minifigures (other than the Battle Droids).</li>
	<li>Solid set overall, both in design and feel.</li>
	<li>Fun build.</li>
	<li>Pretty good for the price- better on sale.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul style=""font-size: medium;"">
	<li>Lacking in Battle Droid carrying capacity.</li>
	<li>Stickers.</li>
</ul>

<p>In conclusion, I really like this set, and would recommend it to any LEGO Star Wars fan. <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">If you can get this set on sale, it will be an even better value.&nbsp;</span>With the upcoming 75086 Battle Droid Troop Carrier and 75080 AAT, this set will have even greater playability, recreating the scene of the Battle of Naboo (for the most part).</p>

"cw_260304","2017-02-06T16:57:11.53Z","An okay set","<p>I think this set is an goodish set the build was good and challenging and you got good figures however compared to the 2007 MTT it is terrible there are lots of gaps and the droid rack only comes with 6 battle droids and it is a lot smaller and it was released for &pound;89.99 which in my opinion is a bad value but the playing value for the kids is brilliant as there are lots of play features.</p>

<p>overall this set is okay but i would definitely&nbsp;stick with the older MTT if you are a collector&nbsp;if you were getting this for your kids it is a must.</p>
