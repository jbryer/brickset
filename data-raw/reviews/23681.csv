<p>LEGO: Legends of Chima: 30265 Worriz&#39; Fire Bike</p>

<p>Pieces: 31</p>

<p>Release Year: 2014</p>

<p>Price: US $3.99</p>

<h3><u><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></u></h3>

<p>This set comes in the standard poly bag that LEGO has used for awhile now. The front shows Worriz on his bike holding some Fire Chi.</p>

<p>The instructions are just like other polybag instructions, small and folded up. They have great rendered images and are easy to understand for any level of builder.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 Just as I expected.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Parts</strong></u></h3>

<p>Nothing special here. All parts are pretty standard.</p>

<p>Overall: 2/5 Nothing worth buying this set flat out for, but not bad either.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Minifigures</strong></u></h3>

<p>For this set the main draw would have to be Worriz or the fact that it is for an impulse buy.</p>

<p>Worriz: Shows up in nine other sets and is in five sets with his red fire suit. Thus, the set is not to be bought of of his rarity in this set. But Chima characters have great detail and is still worth owning. I love the detail that goes into them and recommend them for any collection.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5 Not a unique figure, but still a great one to collect.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Build</strong></u></h3>

<p>The build is over as quickly as it starts, but what do you expect, you bought a polybag set with 31 pieces.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5 fast easy, nothing new in the means of building styles.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Completed Model</strong></u></h3>

<p>The model isn&#39;t terrible in how it looks, but there is something to be desired. The vechile loosely follows the build of other &quot;bike&quot; vehicles that LEGO has produced.</p>

<p>Overall: 2/5 Not a fan of the &quot;bike&quot; build, but with limited pieces it works.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Price</strong></u></h3>

<p>Price for this set is US $3.99. Piece count is 31 with 1 minifigure.</p>

<p>Price-per-piece: $0.129. This is over my typical $0.10 benchmark I hold for all LEGO sets but we must realize that this set is a poly bag and doesn&#39;t apply to the standard I set for most of the other LEGO sets.</p>

<p>Counting in Minifigures: One Minifigure at four pieces (head, helmet, torso, and legs). I count a minifigure at $3.00. Thus the rest of the set would come out to $0.99 at 27 pieces. Price-per-piece: $0.036 which is superb. But this ratio is found in all minifigure based polybag sets.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 Again, its a polybag, you get it for the impulse buy or the minifigure, at $3.99 most polybags are accurately build to fit that price. Thus when I see a polybag with a decent minifigure I go ahead and pick one or two up.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></u></h3>

<p>Simple set with a minifigure that works. Not a need to buy since Worriz isn&#39;t unique to this set. But not a bad one at that either.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5 Pretty standard set.</p>

That being said this is the cheapest alternative to getting him in his fire armour. It&rsquo;s an interesting polybag, let&rsquo;s go over the pros and cons of this.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Worriz in fire armour included with this set. Minifigure print includes double-sided torso and facial print, and leg printing. The printing is a bit more generic compared to the more unique printing from the first year, however it&rsquo;s still a great design.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fire Chi crystal included, cheapest method of obtaining one.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fire Bike includes accessory for Worriz.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model is quick to build and ready to go in under seven minutes.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Model is ugly looking, bike design could use some work. It&rsquo;s really just a glorified block with a pair of wheels attached by Technic pins. Not the best vehicle design in these polybags by a long shot.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d have to say despite the ungainly design of this polybag I&rsquo;d still recommend picking this up if you can still find it. If you&rsquo;re interested in getting some fire armour for custom wolf tribe members doubling up on this set is a good idea. On top of that it&rsquo;s still fun to play with despite looking like a death trap on wheels.</p>

It has some nice parts and a lot of room for playability. I love this set the most because of the sleek finish of the bike. It was a fun build and I overall really enjoyed it. I recommend this set!</p>
