And that says a lot....","<p>This set has been a lot of people&#39;s dream for a long time, a whisper, a rumour, the stuff of unrealised legends. Boba Fett is quite possibly the coolest character from the Star Wars universe, in many people&#39;s minds perhaps in all of cinema.&nbsp;This ship is distinctive, instantly recognisable:&nbsp;nothing short of iconic.<br />
It has a lot to live up to...<br />
...and boy does it!</p>

<p>I have to say as well that&nbsp;I was personally really very pleased with my little #8097 and not actually all that excited about the prospect of a UCS version. I thought it was a fantastic little set, and I liked the Lego proportions, preferring a set that looked at home with all my other System scale sets.<br />
But then photos of this set came out and I was intrigued....<br />
Then I saw the model previewed in the shop and a nagging feeling began to grow....<br />
The sheer size blew me away and I eventually admitted I had to have it....<br />
So I got it, and it lived up to everything I was hoping and more!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As you would expect&nbsp;it&#39;s huge! (This will be a running theme....) The instructions come in one bound booklet which is nice, much better than a series of stapled booklets, and they have sections on the ship, the design, and the like at the start. The instructions are clear throughout too, with only a couple of places where I would have merged a couple of mini-builds into one larger one, but that could always just be my own preference after all.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I can imagine a lot of people buying this set just for the parts. For a Star Wars set it&#39;s fantastic value, probably actually decent value compared to other themes! :P<br />
You won&#39;t be surprised to know most of the parts are dark red, light grey (do we honestly still have to say bluish-? It&#39;s new, of course it&#39;s bluish-grey!) and both sand and dark green. But apart from grey those are all highly desirable colours in their own right. A good number of them are uncommon, the dark red curves were spotted straight away from the photos as being&nbsp;new in that colour, and in fact all three of the dark red 45 degree curves are, as are the dark green curves (I&#39;d not have spotted one of them, they are or course larger than the pieces on 8097!)&nbsp;and a couple of the sand green pieces.<br />
But of course, parts-wise it&#39;s all about that canopy, brand new, trans-clear,&nbsp;8 studs wide - it&#39;s huge! Inventive MOCers must be drooling!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re not buying the set for the parts you could just as easily be buying it for the minifigures. They aren&#39;t all that spectacular and there are only four, but three are a very solid standard, and Boba is surely the best he will ever be.</p>

<p><strong>Boba&nbsp;Fett</strong>&nbsp;is just superb. He&#39;s gone through a few iterations in the last few years that have improved him, in some cases barely at all, but this version must be the best possible.<br />
He has front and back torso printing, leg printing, and even the long awaited&nbsp;arm printing. Of course, we&#39;ve had arm printing before in the Cloud City version, but Boba&#39;s had a big overhaul since the helmet-jetpack original.<br />
Every detail of this figure is superb. Being made in China the gold elbow and knee guards are gold rather than yellow. The left shoulder does indeed have the mythosaur print on.&nbsp;All of the detailing is refreshed -&nbsp;placing it next to the 8097 version amazed me at just how crisp and detailed the torso is. Even the cape has that little added panache, being in light tan but with a dark stripe across it. And I wouldn&#39;t have noticed, preferring my Fett to be faceless, but the head is new too!</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Bespin&nbsp;Guard</strong>&nbsp;is solid quality, not much different to the only other&nbsp;version, but with much crisper printing as expected. The hat is the current mould used for Imperial officers, but is unique in blue without the silver dot in the front centre. And his head is generic enough, previously from&nbsp;a couple of Rebel&nbsp;Endor&nbsp;Troopers. (Surprisingly, originally on the cook on the PotC Queen Anne&#39;s Revenge set!)</p>

<p><strong>Han Solo in Carbonite</strong>&nbsp;is everything you would expect, the same moulded carbonite part as ever, and identical to the most recent version from Jabba&#39;s Palace except for the face printing. The blinded side is the same except for the terrible trend for adding all sorts of&nbsp;extra lines, though this time they actually don&#39;t look too out of place. The reverse is a a concerned mouth-open expression, much like recent Imperial troops.&nbsp;Essentially, it&#39;s Han in carbonite&nbsp;<em>again</em>, but that&#39;s no bad thing.</p>

<p>And the&nbsp;<strong>Stormtrooper</strong>&nbsp;is exactly the same as the recent Star Destroyer version. Thankfully they are not easily distinguished from any of the more recent versions at a glance so they won&#39;t invalidate any armies, but I do really like the edging that has been added to the helmet printing, and the torso and leg printing is good. Again, a solid figure.</p>

<p>I suppose it&#39;s a shame there aren&#39;t a few more figures, but what would they be when the set is all about the lone bounty hunter? A pair of Bespin guards and Stormtroopers perhaps? Some other of the supporting cast from Cloud City? Let&#39;s hope their exclusion is a sign of more Cloud City sets to come before Episode VII dominates the 2015 schedule!<br />
The figure that matters is quite simply&nbsp;outstanding, I&#39;m happy enough with that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s going to get repetitive - every section could be the reason you bought this! I loved this build more than any other model I&#39;ve ever built! It was an absolute joy start to finish.&nbsp;It took me just over three hours (I&#39;m a fast builder), and for a build that long I wasn&#39;t as jaded by the end as I have been on other mammoth&nbsp;builds. It was here that I really started fearing that my beloved Imperial Shuttle #10212, the darling of my collection in so many ways,&nbsp;may be about to lose its crown.</p>

<p>The first satisfying thing is that you (almost) get just one bag per <strong>numbered bag</strong> - finally you can open one bag 1 and not have to search through the rest of them to find the other who-knows-how-many. Bag 1 actually is bag 1! (I think there were three numbered bags where there was a second, smaller bag.)</p>

<p>The next is that each bag builds a very significant portion:&nbsp;the bottom section of <strong>the dark red &#39;dish&#39;</strong> with the first, the top part with the second, and what joins them in the third. Building the significant chunks and then clipping them together is so tactile and begins the &quot;this is huge!&quot; feelings in earnest!</p>

<p>The <strong>stickers </strong>are mostly very easy to attach well if you are familiar with the sort of gap that needs to be left around the edges. The symmetrical pieces that went on the left and right 2x6 curves were the most difficult to get running centrally along the triangular curve.<br />
I do have a couple of complaints here though (beyond the general hatred of stickers that some have of course!). Though the sticker numbering is helpful, the stickers that go on the back of <strong>the&nbsp;stabilisers </strong>are very strangely numbered and placed - the three on each side don&#39;t go together, and the first three are 15, 16&nbsp;and 18, where the second three are 7, 12 and 19. Very odd!<br />
And I suppose it may just be me not paying enough attention (and I&#39;ll mention it here while I&#39;m griping about the stickers), but I wish I had realised the stickers for <strong>the canopy </strong>are best going tight to the 1x2 tile on top and leaving&nbsp;a larger gap at the edge before I&#39;d placed them. I assumed I should get them tight to the edge, painstakingly made them so, and then saw that the edge of the canopy is concealed behind bricks and the gap by the 1x2 tile is hideous. As Dr Dave Watson noted in his excellent review (I&#39;m only writing this as no review is yet attached to the set page) the stickers are a very good quality, very thick, and quite easy to remove and reapply. I managed that with one side, but the other had been applied for too long got slightly creased as I slid a knife under it to get it up again, and left most of its glue behind as I pealed it off. (I have half a mind to try and get a replacement canopy and sticker sheet from customer services!)</p>

<p>A highlight for me in the build was <strong>the cockpit area </strong>- finally Boba&nbsp;gets a decent place to sit! A 2x3 plate with a 1x2 printed tile? 8097, that was pitiful! Here we get the same 1x2 printed tile, but it&#39;s mounted on a large curved console, Boba has 2x2 stickers either side of him, and there are 2x2 printed&nbsp;slope computers that line up by his head in flight mode. Enjoy, Mr Fett!</p>

<p>The full size of the ship begins to emerge as you assemble <strong>the &#39;nose&#39;</strong> of the ship. First the underside, then the front, and finally each side in a bag of its own, the finishing touch of the guns in with the second side. As best as I can tell these side parts are the only part of the build that is not symmetrical (stickers in the cockpit and on the green curve aside), but as they make&nbsp;up a large portion of the ship&#39;s surface area it has quite an effect. The angles achieved are wonderful, very slight in places but very effective, and very cleverly with just a double clip and a new ball joint attachment on each side. The hidden weapon compartments are good too, folding out to face straight forward perfectly and looking suitably dangerous!<br />
My only real criticism of the set as a whole&nbsp;though is that the side panels&nbsp;seem quite flimsy compared to the rest of the build. There is some play that allows them to hinge away from the ship a little, and when you notice that you see quite a gap between the side section and the bottom edge of the cockpit and the huge green curves. I don&#39;t know what other options there could be for attaching the sides more securely, and I suppose the gap isn&#39;t all that wide, but when the rest of the set is so perfect I was a little disappointed when I noticed the little niggles with the very last parts of the build. Somehow coming at the end it feels like a rush job at the end, though I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just unfortunate timing in the build.</p>

<p>The final bag contains the ship&#39;s <strong>stand</strong>, full of Technic angles, and mystifyingly small! Four &#39;prongs&#39; slide into gaps you forgot you left in the very first section you built, and it takes the weight of the entire ship, leaving it maybe 15 degrees off vertical&nbsp;- fantastic for seeming in flight. It&#39;s a very funny feeling, finishing such an engaging and enjoyable build, yet being more amazed at the clever stand you built at the very end. I wonder if I&#39;d have preferred&nbsp;building it at the start instead, though now I think that I realise I did enjoy getting stuck straight into the rusty hull.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There&#39;s not much more to say when you&#39;re done beyond &quot;WOW!&quot; and maybe &quot;WOW!&quot; again!<br />
When I first saw the real thing in the Lego Shop display it was next to the also upcoming Detective Agency, and Slave I made it look tiny and strangely pitiful for a modular.&nbsp;I&#39;ve got this next to my old CRT TV&nbsp;that has the Super Star Destroyer perched on top. It&#39;s as tall as the telly, and somehow it&#39;s solid and chunky looking hull doesn&#39;t seem small next to the giant grey dagger-like wedge. Saying that #10221 doesn&#39;t make it look small should tell you how imposing it is! It&#39;s difficult to decide which is bigger when it&#39;s next to the Imperial Shuttle too. Both those other sets are larger in most dimensions, but Slave I just seems so solid. It is easily at home in the company of those other monstrous UCS sets.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve marked it down on playability only because it&#39;s so huge it&#39;s not easily swooshable. The greebles on the underside (if you can call them that, they&#39;re made from multiple bricks!) can easily be knocked if you just grasp the thing by the dark red &#39;dish&#39; and the clear spacers that make it seem like it&#39;s floating when it lands fly off even more easily still.</p>

<p>But for display, which is clearly the main intent, it is nothing short of astounding. Put it somewhere prominent and it is guaranteed to start conversations. You&#39;ll love gazing at it, remembering how fun it was to build, noticing all the little details&nbsp;that were lost in the sheer size of the build. Even knowing that I&#39;m not 100% happy with the side panels, I look at it and it seems cohesive, solid, like you could grip it anywhere to pick it up. And you almost can! I don&#39;t want to do it too much, but I did pick it up by the nose when I had almost finished building it, it was heavy at that angle but I definitely felt like my grip would give before the structure of the ship. It is an absolute beast of a model!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I imagine you&#39;ve grasped it by now, but I absolutely love this set. It&#39;s the most complete Lego model I&#39;ve ever built&nbsp;with the perfect proportion of different techniques, complex and old school (a surprising number of chunky bricks!), so many great details and highlights,&nbsp;and such a fantastic finished article. I&#39;ve decided, it doesn&#39;t steal the crown of my oh-so-loved Imperial Shuttle...&nbsp;I now have two prized sets! 10212&#39;s not quite beaten, but it&#39;s easily matched.</p>

<p>There is only one question.<br />
It&#39;s not&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;you get this set;&nbsp;it&#39;s&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;you?<br />
If you can, you should!<br />
If you can&#39;t, you should change that!</p>

"Ethiel","2015-01-17T09:35:01.097Z","A lot more than just ""the next UCS""","<p>I collect Star Wars UCS models and modular buildings. I write this review with my experience with other models of that size in my mind.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>the box is pretty much standard. But the instructions are worth mentioning. There are three primary differences to the usual Lego instructions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s one big book. Not 4 or more booklets, but a real softcover book.</li>
	<li>There are a few infos to the model in this book like details about the slave I and an interview with the designer. I never saw this in an UCS model before. It&#39;s not completely new, though. I&#39;ve seen this kind of infos in the lego ideas (cusoo) sets, like the Ghostbusters car.</li>
	<li>The background of the book ist grey. That&#39;s great, because it helps to distinguish between light grey and dark grey pieces. Please Lego, make this standard for ALL instructions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Value/Investment</h3>

<p>200 &euro;/$ for ~2000 Pieces is a good value for a licensed models. Regarding the success of previous slave-I sets and the overall quality of the model, this will raise in value, as soon as it&#39;s out of production. However, I do not expect a drastic price increase like with the star destroyers, because with 200 &euro;/$ it&#39;s much more affordable, so more interested people will get it during regular production time.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Great, big rounded pieces in dark green and red. There were also a handful of pieces I&#39;ve never seen before.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Very high quality. We&#39;ve all seen these characters before in other sets, but these one have a very detailed prinitng, not only on the front of the torso, but also on the legs and on the back. But I am no minifg expert, so I can&#39;t tell you, whether they are completely new.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very fun to build. The set is delivered in numbered bags. You open then one after another to build the model, so you spend a lot of the building time on building the model, not on searching the right piece. It took me about 4,5 hours to complete the model. There are a few steps that need to be done twice, but that&#39;s okay. The build get&#39;s even more interesting in the end, when building the nose to complete the model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s sturdy an surprisingly playable. And playing makes sense, it&#39;s in minifig scale! I love it and still hope for more minifig scale UCS sets. The cockpit can be opened/removed, the seat of the pilot can be tilted for different flying positions, the &quot;wings&quot; adjust themselves to flying position and the cargo bay can be opened to store poor carbonited Han Solo. And there are hidden weapons in the chassis. However, it&#39;s not perfect for playing. Some parts of the chassis are not meant for holding the model and will fall apart, if you do. The cockpit does not completely close, there&#39;s always a small gap, because there is no hinge. The windscreen is connected the nose, so it has the same angle.</p>

<p>But it does stand true to the original model. It only seems a bit to wide on the base. Well, I need to watch the movie again to verify this. :-)</p>

<p>I have 7 Star Wars UCS sets, but only 3 have the fit-for-living-room-seal from my girlfriend. This is one of them.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great model and a lot more, than I had expected when buying it. It&#39;s sturdy, has great colors and has a decent size to display it proudly. It&#39;s absolutely playable, so it&#39;s hard to think of it only as a model for displaying.</p>

<p>The slave I is one of the most interesting ships in Star Wars. But it&#39;s not as famous as a Star Destroyer, X-wing or Millenium Falcon. Therefor you really need to be into Star Wars. Many friends that are not, will ask you a lot of questions like &quot;what&#39;s that ...thing... over there?&quot; So in my eyes the Slave I falls still short to the Imperial Shuttle, which simply has the greater overall design and is therefor better for displaying. Still, in terms of realizing an already existing design with lego, this a superb model.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re into Star Wars and Lego, you need to get this.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re into Lego, but not a Star Wars enthusiast, there might be better choices for you (but not many)</p>

<p>If you want a great model for displaying, you should try to get the Imperial Shuttle first, as long as the price is still acceptable.</p>

"BlueStation","2016-04-17T04:03:59.39Z","Impressive Re-creation of an Iconic Ship","<p>Though he did not receive a lot of screentime or focus in the original Star Wars trilogy, Boba Fett has nonetheless captured the imagination of Star Wars fans as one of the most unique and mysterious characters in the saga. His occupation as a bounty hunter (specifically the bounty hunter who finally brought Han Solo in) in league with the Empire helped widen the Star Wars universe beyond the Empire/Rebellion and did so with very little dialogue, definition, or backstory. While fans would later get more backstory in Episode II (along with an unending amount of clones utilizing his design, dulling his unique impact), there&#39;s no beating the original visuals from The Empire Strikes Back. I feel that one of the major reasons for Boba Fett&#39;s popular and enduring legacy is his truly iconic and one-of-a-kind ship, the Slave I. Nothing else in the saga looks anything like it, and yet it&#39;s hard to think of Star Wars without it - it&#39;s undeniably of this universe. This set brings the Ultimate Collector&#39;s Series touch to the Slave I, and it largely lives up to that lofty standard.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a large and attractive box depicting Slave I cruising near the Cloud City, with the back showcasing the ship on a Bespin landing platform and featuring the several functional elements built in. The instructions are in one bound book featuring information on the ship and the Lego designer. I was surprised to learn the initial design and first model of the ship was completed in just 1 week after the digital design had been drafted - impressive!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Evidently a new trans-clear windshield piece was created to accommodate the scale of the new model (and it&#39;s hard to imagine it&#39;s application in other sets, though Lego has been creative with parts usage before). There are many rare or unique pieces in sand green, dark green, and dark red that are very attractive though I definitely did not approach this set as a parts pack. Many of these pieces are sloped, angled, or SNOT pieces which help achieve the visual of the unique shape of the Slave I.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>While I am trying to grade this set fairly based on the typical approach of most UCS sets up to this point, I do want to make a point that the minifigure selection here is a missed opportunity and is frequently a missed opportunity in this UC series. I understand that the draw of most UCS sets is the display of the impressive model, the complex build, and the collectable nature of the UCS release. But it seems to me that that collectable aspect would be enhanced by a greater minifigure selection, especially with many characters still rare or never released in Lego form. Sets such as the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75059-1/Sandcrawler"">75059-1</a> Sandcrawler or the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10236-1/Ewok-Village"">10236-1</a> Ewok Village seem to be working to rectify that, but that is not the case here.</p>

<p>This is especially noticeable with a Cloud City-related set, because there have been so few sets in this range. It&#39;s become an astonishing oversight in the Lego Star Wars lineage. Lando Calrissian, a major character, has been released just a handful of times. Luke Skywalker in his Cloud City outfit and dueling Darth Vader (the most iconic Jedi battle of the saga) has been re-created I believe just once. How is this possible? Endless waves of Hoth sets continue to be released but the Cloud City, one of the more imaginative Star Wars settings, is largely ignored. Finally this year we saw the release of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75137-1/Carbon-Freezing-Chamber"">75137-1</a> Carbon Freezing Chamber, but with so few minifigures and such an incomplete version of the location, it was a massive disappointment. No Lando, no Lobot, no Chewie with C3PO, no Leia, and on and on. One hopes that the release of that new small set will at least lead to a few more in Cloud City (as Lego often focuses on a setting in phases).</p>

<p>The minifigures that are included here are impressive, though. Boba Fett himself is one of the most detailed figures I&#39;ve ever owned, with seemingly every chip of paint, every arm accessory, every piece of armor included on the graphic printing throughout the figure. It all seems to be here - the shoulder &quot;cape&quot;, the jetpack, the helmet antennae - this is a fittingly impressive figure.</p>

<p>I also have a lot of love for the Bespin Guard - it would be nice to have a couple of them to flank <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9678-1/Twin-Pod-Cloud-Car-Bespin"">Lobot</a> (or in the future, an updated Lando), but it helps to provide color to the Cloud City scene and adds uniqueness to the set.</p>

<p>A frozen Han Solo piece is included, which is snapped into a technic-based door that fits nicely inside the vehicle. Oddly Han Solo is also included - I don&#39;t know if this has been a prerequisite for any set featuring the carbon-frozen version but seems unnecessary here, though his facial expressions are nice for the situation he was in. The set is rounded out with a standard Stormtrooper.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build begins out with the lower half of the base/bottom of the ship, first defining the outer edges of the craft. This surpisingly (to me) featured a 1 stud wide layer, with studs on the sides of some pieces to connect to the rest of the ship. This surprised me because I would expect a large one-stud-wide assembly to be too flimsy a bottom layer - so far though it has held up well. This is the reason why recent versions of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75094-1/Imperial-Shuttle-Tydirium"">Imperial Shuttle</a> have had the main fin/vertical stabilizer so heavily built with technic pieces - it&#39;s more stable. Still, this seems to have worked for the Slave I here; hard to say on the &quot;swooshability&quot; factor though - this is a large craft.</p>

<p>The top half of the base is then constructed and a technic assembly brings the two halves together while also starting to build out to the technic supports that will reach into the cockpit on one side and extend out the long end of the ship on the other side (the bottom when the ship is flying upright).</p>

<p>I was impressed by the level of detail given to the bottom of the ship - the glow of the engines and the unique shape of the fuselage on this side. I didn&#39;t check it against stills from the film but it feels like the ship felt in those movies - and with the 90-degree upright flying position the ship uses, the back/bottom is seen often.</p>

<p>The wings are then built out and while the visual detail is impressive, they at first seem flimsy. This is rectified with later technic additions that stabilize and align the wings to the ship, and allow them to naturally fall into the accurate flight or no-flight positions depending on how the model is resting.</p>

<p>The cockpit comes together quickly and as noted in the instruction manual - this UCS set (unlike some others) is minifigure scale, improving playability and not losing displayability. I have not owned previous versions of the Slave I but this one feels accurate to movie and figure scale and Boba Fett sits nicely in the cockpit seat provide which rolls back to angle him 90 degrees as the ship takes off. Disappointingly given the size, the seat is not allowed to move side-to-side as it appears he does in the film - but this is a minor quibble.</p>

<p>After building out additional structural support for the rest of the ship&#39;s frame (using a combination of technic and system pieces), the top/front of the ship fuselage is achieved utilizing SNOT techniques and many attractive sloped pieces. Some carefully planned technic connections allow for the unique angles of the ship and visually get the job done here, though at first the assembly feels flimsy. As it all comes together, to the designer&#39;s credit, it now seems very sturdy as a whole. The windscreen seems loosely connected however, technic-connected by one main pin and two pins that guide the piece in place, but is not connected at all on the top-side. In other words, don&#39;t swoosh the set upside-down.</p>

<p>The last stages of the build are the side fuselage pieces, largely assemblies of plates and detailing accessories as well as a compartment on both sides for additional hidden weapons, which carefully can be moved in and out.</p>

<p>There are some stickers to apply throughout the build - I think they mostly add wonderful detail in displaying scratched/chipped paint and mechanical elements, and integrating the windscreen into the fuselage. The set would still likely look impressive and detailed without these additions, but I think they work and have no major complaints. The only sticker issue is the Slave I display sticker with ship details - it&#39;s difficult to accurately apply the massive sticker to the large studless plate, so approach this step carefully.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Two things strike you immediately as the model comes together - first, the unique shapes and coloring of the ship have been impressively re-created in Lego beyond any previous Slave I set, and second, this set is HUGE. It is absolutely massive. I couldn&#39;t believe the size of it. It is a UCS set and so that feels appropriate, but it&#39;s still pretty jaw-dropping to look at. Some large Lego sets end up feeling kind of smaller than expected once built - this is not one of those. This set is huge and will almost certainly surprise you how large it ends up being.</p>

<p>While there are a few aspects meant for playability, including the fact that the set functions as minifigure scale, this is mainly a display set. It&#39;s heavy, and sits nicely on the technic-built base, but is hard to hold or &quot;swoosh&quot; and parts of the fuselage seem like they could be broken off with too much movement. I want to stress that it does end up being a sturdy model, but that was a surprise throughout the build as many stages did not seem sturdy enough at the time.</p>

<p>Given the scale and level of detail I was hoping for some potential defined interior of the ship. It&#39;s not depicted in the film really, but it&#39;s suggested that the interior of Slave I has holding cells, rooms, etc. and it would have been nice to have some interior to that effect, or even just a connection to the cockpit that makes it conceivable how Boba Fett walks into the ship and reaches the cockpit. Perhaps due to the frame that needed to be built to accommodate the unique shape, this was not a possibility. With a UCS set however, you want to see the design leave no stone unturned.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this is an impressive set by any measure. The Slave I, one of the most visually unique vehicles and iconic ships of the Star Wars saga, has never looked better in Lego. The size is jaw-dropping, and the detailing throughout makes this as close to a definitive re-creation as one can imagine.</p>

<p>There are some missed opportunities in the minifigure selection and the interior detailing. However these are understandable given the aim of this model to give the Slave I the UCS treatment. This goal is accomplished and it&#39;s an impressive set to display.</p>

<p>One hopes that Cloud City will be a better-represented Lego theme in the future and if given the level of design and care that this ship has gotten - Lego Star Wars will reach new heights of fan imagination and collection.</p>

<p>This build was done over the course of a couple days when our schedule met up. Be sure to clear your schedule because this is a huge set. The completed build itself compares in size&nbsp;to the Death Star.</p>

<p>Building:</p>

<p>Building this set was straight forward as long as you follow the directions. The instruction book is huge and easy to skip a step if you&#39;re not paying close attention.&nbsp;We had many problems with parts coming apart and breaking off. A lot of time was wasted reattaching parts on the rear of the unit multiple times. Two people were defiantly&nbsp;needed to repair and put things back together and tighten things up. The dark red slope pieces also like to come apart.</p>

<p>There is lots of places in this build that use stickers.</p>

<p>Putting the forward guns together was really annoying. The pieces did not want to snap together and I was using enough force to slide things together that it felt like it was going to snap the thin &#39;technic axle&#39;</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>The construction of this ship is fragile and it is heavy. I don&#39;t know if anyone can actually play with this ship&nbsp;without all sorts of pieces coming apart and large sections breaking off. This ship does not like to rest on any part of itself.</p>

<p>The canopy over the flight deck does not contain any hinges and the carbonite cargo is not easy to access once the build is complete.</p>

<p>This will defiantly be an item for display rather than play.</p>

<p>Oddity:</p>

<p>During the build we had one weird slope piece that was a slightly different shade of green on the forward section of slave one above the guns&nbsp;than its counter parts. Seems like a weird misprint and defiantly&nbsp;stands out.</p>

<p>Display Stand.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to need to use the display stand and have a large place to put this unit. The display stand is made of technic pieces. If you&#39;re like us you&#39;ll struggle to figure out how to get Slave One to sit on it. The instruction manual did a poor job showing you how to attach it. As with building Slave One we had a few pieces fall off when it came to rest on the display stand.</p>

<p>The display stand really doesn&#39;t seem all that sturdy and I&#39;m not sure how it will hold up in the long run. It seems like the long technic parts might end up sagging over time.</p>

<p>The informational plaque is also obscured by Slave one.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>This set looks great and is great to display in your collection. However it is not a set for playing with and it doesn&#39;t really seem like any scale to other Star Wars sets. The build is flimsy but huge and you get a lot of pieces for your money. I recommend this for the Hardcore Star Wars fan, but not for anyone looking for play.</p>

Picked it up online from Target for around $215. &nbsp;This was a fun build, took me the better part of a day to assemble and is now the centerpiece of my Star Wars Lego collection. &nbsp;It&#39;s a very large set (to scale with the mini figs) which i love. I only have a few minor complaints with this set. The side walls to the tail are a bit fragile as well as the wings. i had a bit of a struggle to get the wings to attach to the side of the ship evenly. Overall this is a must have for anyone who has a Lego Star Wars display. Beautiful.</p>

"LegoMoose","2018-01-08T13:44:13.433Z","LegoMoose's UCS Slave 1 review!","<p>This is one heck of a set. It is the biggest one I own!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting off, it is perfectly scaled to a minifigure. It is very nicely detailed and is just a great thing to look at. Playability wise, there isn&#39;t much. You can put Boba in the cockpit and his seat should rotate along with the axis of the ship. The wings will also rotate depending on if the ship is in its landing or flying position. There is a little door at the front of the ship that can be swung open and your Han Solo in carbonite will fit snugly in there. There are some hatches on the sides that open to reveal a missile launcher and on the other side, a gun. The viewscreen is a specially made piece for this set. On the bottom of the ship, there is some nice engine detailing.</p>

<p>The set itself is pretty large, but also is very sturdy. The set also comes with a little stand that is <strong>VERY&nbsp;</strong>well made and I can keep my Slave 1 on it without so much as blinking. Of course, don&#39;t put it by a ledge or anything.</p>

<p>The minifigures you get are;&nbsp;</p>

<p>An exclusive Boba&nbsp;Fett ( at least I think so comparing all the other Boba&#39;s. This one has different arm and leg printing)</p>

<p>A bespin&nbsp;wing guard</p>

<p>A Stormtrooper</p>

<p>Han Solo</p>

<p>And Han Solo in carbonite&nbsp;(Han Solo fits in the back of it)</p>

<p>All in all, this set is more of a model than a play set. I love getting my first UCS set, and this is probably one of my favorites.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building is great, the model is great, the price per piece is set just right. It is just an awesome set. My rating is a <strong>5/5</strong>. I would&#39;ve liked to see a bit more playability, but the model is just too nice to lower the rating for that.</p>

<p>Have a great day/evening and happy building!</p>

"Chemistry2101","2020-04-24T12:46:32.453Z","An Absolute Masterpiece","<p>When this was released back in 2015 and I saw it on display at my local LEGO store, I just knew I would have to buy it, it just looked <i>that</i> good. At the time it was only the 3rd UCS set I owned, and my first real display UCS set, so it&#39;s thanks to this set that I got into collecting this particular line of Star Wars LEGO. Anyway, on with the review!</p>

<p>The Box:</p>

<p>The box art looks amazing, with a beautiful&nbsp;scene of the model over Bespin. Definitely some of the best box art TLG has ever produced. Personally I don&#39;t really care about the box too much, but if you like a well-designed box then you certainly won&#39;t&nbsp;be disappointed.</p>

<p>The Parts:</p>

<p>The parts are pretty amazing and offer a nice range of colours and shapes, with nice amounts of the dark red, sand green and dark green on offer. There are a lot of nice curves and slopes that lend themselves very well to recreating the iconic shape of the ship. The &quot;windscreen&quot; piece is really nice, and is actually still unique to this set.</p>

<p>The build:</p>

<p>5 years on, I can&#39;t say I remember too much about the build other than it was fun, and that it took a reasonable amount of time for my 13 year old self to complete. There are some really nice building techniques used to create the iconic shape, and the internal technic frame is quite interesting to construct. Personally I remember loving how the sleek exterior curves came together, and overall it was just a nice, satisfying build. The one issue I did have would be the stickers. Now I know there is a long-running debate within the LEGO community as to the pros and cons of using stickers (mainly cons). While I understand that maybe a printed plaque isn&#39;t the best way to go, as it is hard to achieve enough detail,&nbsp;I do think maybe pre-applied stickers could be an option for those who want really precise alignment. For the other stickers in the set I&nbsp;think printing is definitely the way to go, and to be fair to TLG more recently we have started to see more printing and fewer stickers being used on the more expensive sets. The stickers on this set aren&#39;t nightmarish but are plentiful and&nbsp;do need to be applied accurately to achieve a nice end result, so just bear that in mind if you are considering purchasing.</p>

<p>The Minifigs:</p>

<p>Being a UCS set the minifigs aren&#39;t really this set&#39;s&nbsp;major selling point but they are nonetheless a welcome addition. The Boba minifig is nice but if you&#39;re buying this set you probably already have a similarly detailed version of him given how many sets he appears in. The Han Solo in Carbonite is a nice inclusion and can be clipped into the entrance to the ship for in-flight storage which I find to be a particularly nice if unnecessary play feature in this UCS set. Again though you may already have him and there is nothing unique about this version. Another Stormtrooper is always a good thing as you can never have too many Stormtroopers, but if you want lots of Stormtroopers there are much cheaper ways out there to buy them. The Bespin&nbsp;guard is a great figure that at the time was unique to this set however nowadays there are other sets containing the same or similar figures. Still a great figure though.</p>

<p>The Finished&nbsp;Set:</p>

<p>Unlike some of the older UCS sets (ahem, Super Star Destroyer, I&#39;m looking at you) this set has been designed to be viewed from all angles, and has not only lots of sleek curves on the top, but also some fabulous engines and other mechanical detail on the underside. I particularly like the SNOT walls that are fixed onto the base to give it a smooth finish, as well as the trans clear studs and 1x1x1/3 rounded tiles that lift this set up off the ground when not on its stand to give the impression of hovering, just like in the film. The cockpit is well-designed and rotates nicely to any orientation of your choice, and the fins at the sides drop nicely with gravity to face down at all times. There are numerous hatches on the side of the ship that can open to reveal weapons, and the main guns rotate together as they are connected via a technic axle. The main entrance to the ship consists of a door the flips up and forwards, and this can be pushed into the roof of the ship above it as it were to remove it out of your way. The stand fits well into&nbsp;the back of the ship to provide a robust yet unobtrusive method of display, and shows off the ship fantastically at&nbsp;a great angle.&nbsp;Overall the design is very pleasing and could not really have been attempted better at this part count (1996).</p>

<p>The Price:</p>

<p>At &pound;179.99 or $199.99 for 1996 this set falls on or below the often quoted 10ppp or 10cpp cost to part ratio. Given that this is a premium product intended for display, I therefore think the price is very reasonable for what you get. Noting that this is only available on the aftermarket these days, it should still be available MISB for approximately retail price as this set does not seem to have experienced the massive value increase of its forebears strangely enough. I would therefore suggest the cost is still very much worthwhile for this set, at least for the moment.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>Overall I really love this set, especially since it was the catalyst that sparked my collecting of at least 12 other UCS sets to date. It has an absolutely phenomenal design with very few if any drawbacks, except perhaps the stickers, and the stand is a great way of displaying this set to its full potential. The minifigs are a nice but unnecessary inclusion for what is very definitely one of the true UCS greats. Would I suggest you buy it? I would argue that depends on what kind of LEGO enthusiast you are.if you&#39;re a collector and displayer of larger sets, and have the money and room to spare, then I would definitely recommend you get this set sooner rather than later while it&#39;s still available at a decent price.&nbsp;</p>

"Deadlocked21","2020-03-31T16:20:45.427Z","Phenomenal Set","<p>This set is, to me, everything that a UCS set should be. Whereas some sets feel repetitive and/or boring to build, this was enjoyable from start to finish, extremely satisfying to watch it come together, and ultimately a beautiful result. It doesn&#39;t feel like this set is wasting parts in any way, nor does it overlook any details for the sake of a lower piece count, and the end result is one of the best display set Lego has ever made.</p>

<p>First, the minifigures. At the time, this set featured a brand-new stormtrooper design that was a significant improvement on its predecessors, a Han Solo in carbonite that looks great, a pretty unique Bespin guard and, oh my god, Boba&nbsp;Fett looks stunning. The design on every single part of this minifigure is perfect. The legs, arms, torso, helmet - hell, even his cape is vastly improved over previous models. I do wish it had some other bounty hunters (i.e. Bossk or IG-88 or something like that), but every minifigure feels great.</p>

<p>As for the displayability of this set -&nbsp;I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m not the biggest fan of the stand - it works perfectly fine, but it feels like the set is going to drop every time I put it on. That barely detracts, however, from the amazing job Lego did on this set. Not only did they create a brand-new window piece for it (which looks amazing), but the curvature of this set is really quite astonishing.</p>

<p>The one and only area where it&#39;s &quot;lacking&quot; - and I really don&#39;t feel like this is a flaw, given it is first and foremost a display piece - is the playability. Do not, and I cannot stress this enough,&nbsp;<em>do not</em>&nbsp;get this for a kid to play around with. It doesn&#39;t have any flick-fire missiles or stud shooters or anything like that, and it&#39;s heavy enough that a normal kid would probably drop it trying to fly it around. This barely detracts from it though, and I can honestly say that this is probably up there with the UCS Millenium Falcon and Star destroyer as one of the best UCS sets ever made.</p>

"jalc_45","2020-12-31T23:23:03.767Z","Considered by many the best set in the Star Wars theme. ","<p>I hope the title doesn&#39;t cause any controversy. I acknowledge the sheer size and detail of the UCS Falcon, and admire the majesty of the UCS Imperial Shuttle,&nbsp;but in my humble opinion, you just cannot beat the combination of the two, here in this set.</p>

<p>When I first laid eyes on this set, it was the year 2015. I was only eight years old, and, in all honesty, wasn&#39;t very intrigued. Two years later however, this set was my main Christmas wish. I did, obviously get it, and I was very happy with it, and I still am. (Also, please excuse any grammatical inconsistencies, considering I am only a thirteen-year-old.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Box</strong></p>

<p>Standard lego box, albeit no logo/design on the top banner, as in Yoda&nbsp;on #10240. Upon opening the box, you will find nothing different, no smaller boxes like in&nbsp;Master Builder Series sets. The art on the box is fantastic, it beautifully captures&nbsp;the likeness of Bespin clouds with the sun shining on them, much like the box art on 75251.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Bag one&nbsp;contains our first minifigure (more on that later), and is just starting the base of the ship. Bags two, three and four are more of the same, three and four in my opinion being very enjoyable with all the different slopes pieces you are applying. Bag five connects the two pieces of the base you&#39;ve&nbsp;built. Bags six and seven have one minifigure respectively, and they&#39;re just building some of the structure and the wings. Eight and nine finish up the cockpit. Ten starts building what I would call the nose, and introduces this lovely cockpit canopy piece, new for the set. Eleven and twelve are the armor on either side of the &ldquo;nose&rdquo;, and thirteen is the stand and the final fig. The build is overall&nbsp;enjoyable, not very monotonous, and relatively long for&nbsp;about two thousand pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The first is a generic Bespin guard, the first since the year 2006, that figure had both&nbsp;dark skin, and arm printing. The skin tone was appreciated because Lego was introducing some diversity in their sets, and I wish they would do that&nbsp;more often generic no-name figures. And arm printing&nbsp;is always appreciated, but this already got some so it&#39;s fine. The second minifigure would be Han Solo in carbonite, along with a minifigure whose design is based off of Han Solo, or at least, what Han Solo looks like directly after being released from the carbonite, so it is an accurate figure to include to be encased in carbonite. Only one bag later, we have the star of this set, Boba Fett. The arm printing is exquisite and extremely detailed. The last Boba Fett we got was young Boba Fett two years prior, and the last armored version of him was 2012. The final figure is a pretty generic Stormtrooper. This specific version of it debuted the year before and it looks nice still. I, owning both this Sormtrooper helmet mold, and the most recent bulky one definitely prefer this older one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Complete Model</strong></p>

<p>The completed model is *clearing throat&nbsp;to&nbsp;a Darth Vader impression* &ldquo;Most impressive.&rdquo; The footprint is large, but not obscenely so, to quote my mother. Displayed up on the stand, it poses quite a menacing figure. The wings will rotate along with the ship on their own, the cockpit however, must be rotated manually, but it will rotate. The dual cannons on the &ldquo;nose&rdquo;&nbsp;the bottom are linked, so they&nbsp;rotate together. Just for the sake of clarity for the rest of the review I will be talking about the Slave 1 as if it is in landing mode, so don&#39;t get confused when I&#39;m talking about the location of different details on the set. The sand green rectangular shape among the light grey just to the direct write of those large dark green semi-circle looking pieces, is a hidden panel that pops out. On the side facing us in the photo, it has&nbsp;dual ion blasters (I think), and on the opposite side in the same place, it has a concussion missile. The loading ramp directly underneath the nose of the ship (as if the nose is a roof) does not lift up or move in&nbsp;any other way, contrary to previous Slave 1 models, as that was where you stored Han&nbsp;Solo in carbonite. If you were minifigure sized and you walked up a loading ramp you would see a large grey slab in front of you, that is the door. You can lift up the door so it is parallel with the bottom of the nose and store the Han Solo in carbonite. It clips on with the door, so they are connected together. The set is incredibly sturdy so don&#39;t be afraid to, as in the designer video for this set&nbsp;Hans Burkhard Schl&ouml;mer said, &ldquo;Swoosh it around.&rdquo; In the back of the ship there is a small hidden door (escape hatch), that resemble an upside down capital &ldquo;T&rdquo;. So if you lose any Minifigures or pieces inside you can just pop the door open shake it around and the piece will slide out.&nbsp;The &ldquo;escape hatch&rdquo; is not very large and doesn&#39;t look bad. The back is extremely detailed, and I really like everything about it. My only qualm is the fact that the engine detailing should really be orange instead of blue, but that&#39;s relatively minor. One last thing about the cockpit, there is a bit of standing area, with pretty cool printed pieces that have been used before, and rent very common these days. I would say about two figures could stand there only in landing mode though. Otherwise, they would be sideways.&nbsp;There is more interior room, but it&#39;s&nbsp;unusable. No studs for anyone to stand on anywhere, and it is extremely hard to access. There&nbsp;aren&#39;t an incredibly excessive number of stickers in the set but there are still quite&nbsp;a few. I would get up and count them but I really don&#39;t have the energy. Instant ramen I feel like has been the only food in my body for days, and it is not very nourishing, but I digress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Verdict</b></p>

<p>The large size, many little greebles (spelling?), sheer amount of detail, and the amazing Boba Fett fig make this set quite possibly my favorite (I&#39;m American, remember?) set of all time. It was well worth 200 dollars, I would easily buy for 250. If I had 250 dollars that is... heh. Anyways, if this a set you are thinking about getting, and you can find it for less than 300 dollars (or the equivalent in whatever currency you use), please, BUY IT.&nbsp;</p>

"Vikn","2021-02-03T03:50:07.26Z","My luckiest acquisition!","<p>What else can I say that hasn&#39;t been said about this beloved iteration of one of the most beloved ships in Sci-Fi? I&#39;d wager this is one of the few sets that was able to please every Lego fan, no matter their preferences.</p>

<p>I only got back into Lego when I was 25-26ish, so early 2019. I had loved them as a child but my teen-adult hobbies were pretty much as far from Lego building as possible...more things like music festivals and partying than indulging my nerd side. However, after getting married and chilling out a bit, I randomly had a yearning to buy a set while shopping for a heater with my wife.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After buying the one set I began a year long adult lego rampage that ended in December 2019 (but my 2nd lego phase began last month). In that years time I had some amazing luck in acquiring sets that were retired prior to my resurfacing interest in Lego. Three of my luckiest finds were the UCS Sandcrawler, the Tower of Orthanc and, of course, the UCS Slave I.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I equally love each of my crown jewel sets, after having time to really think about it,&nbsp; I concluded that I was most fortunate to find the UCS Slave I. Seeing how beloved it is and how every star wars lego fan covets the best iteration of Boba&#39;s ship (as well as the general price it goes for) I can&#39;t believe how fortunate I was. Late 2019 I found this set for UNDER the original retail price (170$) on my local craigslist.</p>

<p>Brand new and in the unopened box, I jumped on the chance to have this. The seller was not a lego fan and was just trying to unload a ton of toys and items he had in storage.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So enough of my quasi-boasting about my luck and gratefulness about finding this and onto an actual review. To be honest, It won&#39;t be long because there is little to say that hasn&#39;t been already repeated innumerable times.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build? As near perfect as a lego set can be. There are around half a dozen builds that just felt flawless and where I was entirely engaged for the duration. This is, of course, one of them. Peak lego experience.</p>

<p>The model is supremely display-worthy. My biggest complaint with certain lego sets, particularly vehicles, is the scale. I really don&#39;t like the sets where the scale if well under minifigure scale...I understand that it isn&#39;t always possible or reasonable for Lego to make everything to scale, but nevertheless, it&#39;s a major factor in my decision to buy a set. I also strongly dislike facade buildings for similar reasons as my dislike for shrunken vehicles...to be fair, I equally don&#39;t like OVER sized vehicles. I want as close to accurate size and aesthetic as possible, but that&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>This is the closest to true minifigure scale of any set I am aware of. Assuming that the unique Boba minifig is human-sized, the UCS Slave I looks almost exactly the right size proportionally.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While there isn&#39;t much to the interior, it does have a more detailed cockpit compared to any other Slave I. The area from the entry door to the cockpit isn&#39;t build up like an interior but it IS roomy enough to feel like the inside of a ship. I can imagine a skilled builder (or just someone willing to&nbsp;take apart such a model) being able to modify the build in such a way that gives it some interior detail. The interior is certainly tight, but at least it has some form of pathway through the ship, something I can&#39;t say for the much smaller 20th Anniversary Edition and I would imagine any before it.</p>

<p>What puts this set apart from others is the realistic scale, impressive look and enjoyable build. There&#39;s really very few sets I could reccomend more to a major Star Wars fan, especially those who love the criminal underbelly and grimier locations. Boba Fett has always represented much of that for fans.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t imagine any review&nbsp;will turn people away or towards the UCS Slave I, this seems to be one of the most universally loved or desired sets by Lego fans. At this point, being retired, I would say this is still worth the high price it tends to go for. No other iteration of the Slave I does it justice like this. All I can do is reiterate my experience with it and hope it motivates some fans to try and buy it themselves.</p>

<p>In the last part of my review, I will briefly compare the UCS Slave I to the 20th Anniversary edition. I own both of them. They were at the very top of my list to purchase being such a fan of the ship and the aspects of Star Wars that it represents.</p>

<p>The UCS model is the clear choice for adult SW fans who are after a realistic, detailed and display worthy model. Its accuracy outdoes the 20th Anniversary model by a pretty wide margin. For someone like myself, it can&#39;t be beat. The size difference is also notable, with the UCS model having nearly 2k pieces and the 20th Anniversary Edition having half that. The size is immediately apparent, with the UCS model being far more accurate. To me, accuracy in these types of sets matters a lot. I know that isn&#39;t universal. I also tend to avoid sets that give us an oversized version of a ship for the same reasoning...&nbsp;the larger set isn&#39;t always better, but in this case and for my standards, it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there are some areas in which the 20th Anniversary set outdoes the UCS model. First off would be the minifigures. Both sets have a small selection. The UCS Boba Fett is far superior to any iteration and feels like a major gift to fans. Aside from Boba, the UCS set has a typical storm trooper, Bespin Guard and Han Solo with his carbonite block. They&#39;re good, but Boba is the only standout. The 20th Anniversary set has 4-LOM, Zuckuss, a newer Han+carbonite and a special collectible princess Leia.&nbsp; The Leia is solely for display but the others contribute directly to the set. The Boba is still great, just not quite the UCS minifig. Its basically a matter of Stormtrooper+Guard vs. 4LOM+Zuckuss. I think most fans would prefer the latter two, theyre just far more exclusive and interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another area where the UCS set is beat is playability. Not a factor to me, but I assume some younger fans (or maybe older, IDK) do consider it when deciding on what to get. While the UCS model is well constructed, it is clearly for display purposes... I wouldn&#39;t put it through a child&#39;s playtime and expect it to survive. The 20th Anniversary version is extremely durable and even has a handle for flying it. The techniques used to contruct this model with half the pieces of the UCS model really seem to ensure this is one of the most durable lego ships ever. It feels like you could drop it without much issue, but that isn&#39;t something I would care to test.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So that&#39;s it. Go with the 20th Anniversary Slave I for playability and Minifigures. Otherwise, the UCS is the best Slave I and one of the best SW ships lego has ever produced.&nbsp;</p>

"RundownPear","2022-03-22T13:58:44.24Z","A Classic From the Modern Age","<p>This is the earliest set of recent memory that I can definitively say is a classic. The build is near perfect with the only complaint being the main body sags from the cockpit a little (this can be easily fixed with some technic). It has some cool features such as the deployable canon and missile as well as the door by the loading ramp. This mixed with the accurate scale and stable base make it a somewhat viable play, which&nbsp;is unique amongst the UCS line. This was no accident as the designers wanted to make it a swooshable yet displayable model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures range from good to amazing. The Boba Fett included is one of the most desired figures out there with insane amounts of detailing and a unique face print. The auxiliary figures are nothing above average but aren&#39;t bad or misplaced. It is a shame this was before the UCS sets came with built-in display stands as that would have been nice to see here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is one of the most solid sets out there. Great display presence, great value at the time of release, and a great build. Can&#39;t recommend this set enough, although I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this gets remade within the next 3 years. &nbsp;</p>
