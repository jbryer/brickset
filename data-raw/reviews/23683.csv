"TheFadedTBCap","2014-08-24T20:43:36.91Z","The Set Batman Fans Deserve, But is it the One They Need?","<p>Being a VIP member has its advantages, and getting set like these early is definitely one of them. &nbsp;Being the big Batman fan that I am, as soon as this set was revealed I had to get it. &nbsp;It does not disappoint. &nbsp;The LEGO Group does a great job of replicating the Tumbler from The Dark Knight Trilogy. &nbsp;It really is one spectacular model.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>To contain the over 1,800 pieces, the box is pretty large and thick. &nbsp;The front portrays a front/ left&nbsp;side view of the Tumbler cruising the streets of Gotham in the search of the criminal and corrupt. &nbsp;It also shows the two exclusive minifigures in the is set: Christian Bale Batman and Heath Ledgers&#39;&nbsp;Joker. &nbsp;On the back, there is another picture of the Tumbler, as well as alternate positions like the back, interior, and a blue print like view from top, front, back, and side views highlighting the gold elements. &nbsp;There is also a picture of the display stand with the minifigures standing by. &nbsp;One side&nbsp;of the box shows the minifigures and the front tires in actual size. &nbsp;The box gives a good look at what you&#39;re about to get into.</p>

<p>There are five instructions&nbsp;manuals to follow. &nbsp;All have the same image of the front of the box as their cover. &nbsp;The pages inside resemble blue graph paper with &quot;Classified Wayne Industries Applied Sciences Division&quot; stamp added on the top right corner of some pages,&nbsp;which is a nice touch. &nbsp;The list of pieces can be found at the end of the fifth manual. &nbsp;They are easy enough to follow throughout the build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Only the tires and minifigures are new to this set, but that doesn&#39;t stop it from having very rare and useful pieces. &nbsp;There are many angular plates/bricks, clips and hinges, tiles, sideways building bricks, and Technic elements. &nbsp;The new tires are fantastic heavy duty wheels and really do match the movie Tumbler.</p>

<p>Though the parts are great, spending 200 dollars on set just for MOC building is a way too much. If by some chance you can spare this kind of money on set to build you own model, this is a great set for black elements for vehicles like cars, planes, or spaceships.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures in this set are a great touch&nbsp;and are well designed, even though the model isn&#39;t minifigure scale&nbsp;by any means. &nbsp;The Batman is similar to other Batman, but is designed to look like Bale&#39;s representation from Nolan&#39;s movies. &nbsp;His face is double-sided, both sides having a white strip to give the cowl its white glaring eyes. &nbsp;One side of the face is a calm but serious expression. &nbsp;The other side is more of a stern&nbsp;and angry face. &nbsp;Both faces show the emotion in the mouth, since its the main thing showing under the mask. &nbsp;The torso is well detailed with printing on the front and back displaying a muscular and well armored battle suit. On his torso is also a bronze belt that looks very similar to the one in the films. &nbsp;The belt continues from the front and is printed on the back. &nbsp;Batman comes with a black cape with a wavy cut bottom and a batarang. His legs are solid black.</p>

<p>The real prize minifigure is the Joker, based of the one from <em>The Dark Knight</em> movie. &nbsp;His green hair flows around his head in multiple directions. &nbsp;Like Batman, he too has a double-sided face. The first side shows of an evil&nbsp;smiling expression, displaying his scars, white makeup, and black painting around his eyes. &nbsp;The other side of his face is a frowning expression in anger, still with the makeup and scars. &nbsp;Its cool to have a tan head with white printed makeup similar to the films. The Joker&#39;s torso is purple with blue gloves. &nbsp;The front of the torso is printed with his purple overcoat, green and grey vests, and his multicolored tie. &nbsp;On the back there are lines representing the depth in the fabric. &nbsp;The pants continue his over coats down to his knees. &nbsp;on his right leg the is a silver chain that slips out between the overcoat. The Joker is really a well detailed minifigure.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build was very fun and was cool to find out how all the angles worked out. &nbsp;It took me over a couple hours to complete and came in many bags labeled in 11 steps. &nbsp;There is pretty much every type of joint used to create the Tumbler&#39;s plating, including clips and hinges, clicking joints, and ball joints. &nbsp;There is also a great use of Technic bricks to get the angles&nbsp;needed. &nbsp;It starts with a strong Technic base with plates added to it. &nbsp;From here you build the interior which has two nice seats, the lever like in the films, and many different display screens, &nbsp;The screens are all stickered&nbsp;tiles and such, so it would look really lame without them. &nbsp;Other sticker issues was applying a circle red dot on a circular one by one plate (good luck). &nbsp;From this base. you build&nbsp;off using various bricks and plates to create a sturdy foundation to apply the plates and other bricks to crate the angled armor. &nbsp;Building it shows you how much detail is in this set. &nbsp;The really fun is seeing how the designers pull out all the stops to create&nbsp;the details from the real Tumbler. There are a lot of great techniques throughout this build. &nbsp;However, some these techniques lead to many bricks resting on single clip joints and other weak connections leading to some fragile and easily movable parts.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>When the model is finished, it truly is a masterpiece. &nbsp;It looks so remarkable similar to the movie Tumbler it is amazing. &nbsp;It all just molds so well. &nbsp;The interior can be accessed by removing the resting roof parts on&nbsp;top. &nbsp;These parts are just laying there on plates. so they will fall off if tipped over. &nbsp;Inside there is a&nbsp;well designed with its monitors, two seats, and the lever and handles. The back shows the the rocket propulsion device with some fuel tanks and gages. &nbsp;There are also two shock absorbs that are made from some worm gears (completely for looks) for the massive tires ready for any terrain. &nbsp;The sides show more angled plating and an angled window as well as a ventilation system. &nbsp;The front shows the two prongs&nbsp;connecting to the tires and the tilted back windshield&nbsp;with little wipers as well as headlights. On the top near the back as well as the sides near the tires there are adjustable flaps or wings. &nbsp;It is also huge! &nbsp;Much bigger than I expected. &nbsp;The model is about 17 inches long, 6 inches high, and 9 inches&nbsp;wide. &nbsp;The display stand is cool too with many great facts. &nbsp;It is also clear that the finished model is made for display rather than for play. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>This is an awesome set! &nbsp;The way that it resembles the real Tumbler it is truly amazing. &nbsp;The details are great and the minifigures are a nice touch. &nbsp;Even the display stand is a cool feature. But with all that being said, this is clearly meant to be a display set. &nbsp;With no functions&nbsp;or minifigure compatibility, it was not designed for playing around with, docking its playability. However, the parts are good and bout 10 cents a piece isn&#39;t bad at all. &nbsp;This is a great set any Batman fan, especially one that enjoys LEGO building too. &nbsp;If you have the cash and fall into the LEGO Batman fan category, this is the set for you.</p>

"scolioreset","2014-08-29T09:07:52.817Z","The Tumbler? Oh, you wouldn't be interested in that...","<p>If you know this quote from Batman Begins, then you can guess my opinion already.&nbsp;What can I say about the Tumbler that you don&#39;t know already? It is a fantastic vehicle designed by Nathan Crowley and Christopher Nolan before the filming of Batman Begins. It&#39;s a vehicle that works for real, it&#39;s noisy and it&#39;s the king of the roads of Gotham City. It does come in black... You want a vehicle like this... You want a Batmobile! But as a Lego set, do you need it? Do you deserve it? (my first language is french so please bear that in mind while reading the review)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>My first impression of the set was definitely positive&nbsp;because the box is huge! When I got the set from Lego Online (thanks to Lego btw), I already knew what to expect from the actual set since I saw it in a Lego Store... but I&#39;d no idea of how big the box was. I was a bit sad of opening this box (despite being very careful) because the preview is good, the pictures are fantastic. The idea&nbsp;of showing some blueprint-like pictures on the bottom is very cool which adds a lot to the &quot;Applied Sciences Division&quot; factor. The picture of the vehicle in the Bat-Bunker is amazing too but it&#39;s nowhere near the actual size of the vehicle once you&#39;ve done building it.</p>

<p>The idea of splitting the instructions into five books is something I don&#39;t really enjoy because I wish that every single UCS set would have binding rings. It would add a lot more to the &quot;prestige&quot;, I don&#39;t know... Despite this, it&#39;s still great to take a peak before building it. We have a look on how parts are put together, how you&#39;ve to place sections so you can get the angles right. It&#39;s a bit complex. I&#39;ve also seen a small mistake with the &quot;preview&quot; image while opening the bag 7. It&#39;s the same image than the actual REAL preview of what the set should look like once the pieces from the bag 8 are put together. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the only one who have seen this mistake but take a look at the turbo jet on the preview for the bag 7. Other than that, I would also prefer different angles despite having no problems putting the sections on the build.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Before jumping into the actual set... the minifigures are completely superficial despite being fantastic. Warning: DON&#39;T get this set for the minifigures. If you can, buy them from Bricklink&nbsp;but there&#39;s no doubt they will be expensive. As they&#39;re... they&#39;re great. The Batman figurine... I like the the printings. The Batman Begins armor seems to be an excellent match for the set because we&#39;ve seen this armor AND the Tumbler mostly in the first movie. The face is pretty basic but the fact that there&#39;s no smile is really funny compared to all other Batman sets. I suppose this is for the &quot;Christian Bale&quot; look but... Is it what he&#39;s underneath? After all, it&#39;s what he does that defines him. Overall, the armor-printing is great!</p>

<p>The Joker... the most wanted Heath Ledger Joker... is absolutely awesome. I do understand why this was such an anticipated minifigure and Lego was brilliant enough to put this version of the Joker in this set. The printing is great but I do admit that the printing on the face (especially the white) isn&#39;t that clear. Otherwise, the eyes and the mouth really pop out. Again, you&#39;ve the choice of two sides. I do like the smiling one because it reminds me of the Interrogation Scene from The Dark Knight. The serious look is also great because he looks a bit menacing. Overall, great minifigures but, for me, they&#39;re overshadowed by what the actual set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Since I didn&#39;t build hundreds of sets, some pieces of the set were totally new to me. I&#39;m mostly used to the Star Wars starships with the traditional mix of both Technic and System. I&#39;m impressed by the axle and the panel that are holding the tires. By the way, the tires do give you a preview of the size but they really help the Tumbler to stay on the table. It doesn&#39;t roll easily because the tires are quite sticky. The rest was not that impressive but there a lot of black bricks. If you intend to buy the Tumbler for the pieces, you will be disappointed because except the Technic&nbsp;panels, there aren&#39;t many rare pieces from what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is probably the set I&#39;ve enjoyed the most since 7150 TIE Fighter &amp; Y-Wing because at this time, I was finally jumping into Lego and Star Wars but I&#39;ve been a fan of Batman way before. I always wanted to have a Batmobile in Lego and there I have it (I missed on the 7784 UCS Batmobile). However, the set is designed so well that I&#39;d to stop and take a look on how sections were put and how much the angles had an impact on the overall set.</p>

<p>The build was sometimes complicated because of the instructions not being exactly precise in what angle (viewpoint on the instructions). I&nbsp;was a bit confused but it took me nearly 6 hours to build the Tumbler. The first bags are the longest parts of the build because it&#39;s the skeleton and the interior of the Tumbler so you need to be careful on how you put the pieces and Technic parts. At the beginning, it&#39;s sturdy but as it progresses, the set becomes flimsy so you need to be careful while moving it around to reach specific angles. Oh and, Lego... Can you please stop with the stickers in UCS sets? Thanks in advance...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is where the set really shines. Once you&#39;re done, you&#39;re proud... because the set is ABSOLUTELY fantastic! It&#39;s not a 100% replica of Nolan &amp;&nbsp;Crowley&#39;s design because I&#39;ve spotted several mistakes that are perfectly forgiven by the amount of details and care that have been put on this set. The Tumbler is gigantic, it can roll, the interior is wonderful too. I cannot think of a single thing done wrong except the flaps being really fragile but that&#39;s to be expected from a set like that. It is as big as I saw it in Lego Store, it&#39;s really heavy but it looks much better once you can see all the details and effort. The propane tanks, the jet turbine, the tires... It&#39;s just clear with the size and details that including a Bat-Pod would be too much and the pricepoint would be ridiculous. Even if you include the Bat-Pod, it wouldn&#39;t be minifigure-scaled. Sometimes, you need to make a choice.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Put the stickers and flimsy sections in the cons... and the rest are pros. The Tumbler is a fantastic set! If you&#39;re a fan of the Tumbler or the Batmobile in general and you&#39;ve any form of interest in Lego, I do recommend you check out videos and pictures so you can have a good impression of the set. If you got the money and you love The Dark Knight Trilogy... it&#39;s about&nbsp;time&nbsp;I send you this&nbsp;message: it&#39;s THE set for you and I hope you&#39;ll get it!&nbsp;I had so much fun building it, it looks great on my table... I really felt like a young child having a first Lego (I know how it feels). Despite this, it&#39;s NOT a set for the kids since it has no play features! Of course, they&#39;ll enjoy seeing the parent or the older brother/sister building the set.&nbsp;The stars I give are based on my critique, opinions and realistic infos about the set.&nbsp;Again, if you have enough money to afford this set and you love the Batmobile/Nolan trilogy, then it&#39;s a set for you. This baby looks more than just fine. Kudos to the designers!</p>

"AdeelZubair","2015-03-25T18:19:12.007Z","“Why So Serious? This Baby Works Just Fine!”","<p><strong>First Impression</strong><br />
2014 was a very impressive year for LEGO fans; a huge number superb sets that were released including this impressive and outstanding recreation of the Tumbler from The Dark Knight Trilogy. It was first mentioned by Jason from The Brick Show on Youtube that we have a UCS Tumbler on the way. Since then many have speculated the set would be released because last year was the 75th anniversary of the Caped Crusader and we would see a Batman vehicle based off the classic Batman comics or movies such as Jerry Robinson&rsquo;s, Batman 66&rsquo;s, Batman Animated Series or even a redesign of the Batman &amp; Robin Batmobile. In fact I would love for LEGO to release those but the popularity of The Dark Knight movie made this model happen. After many fans have trying to replicate this iconic vehicle and many LEGO Ideas submissions we have finally got a UCS Batman Tumbler from LEGO themselves! I was super pumped for this set: one hand it&#39;s a large scale car model (which I enjoy) and it&#39;s based on a very much loved film franchise and character that I and others enjoy; the price just put me off until now! Was it worth it though?</p>

<p><strong>Unique Parts</strong><br />
Besides the obvious exclusive minifigure parts there are two exclusive pieces those being the Tyre Wide &Oslash;81,6X44 (front wheels) and the Pearl Gold Wheel Bearing Back. Surprisingly the Batman head is exclusive.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
This set includes Batman and the Joker minifigures, I guess they are only included to boost sales for rather large set; even though they are not in scale with the model as the box states. Those minifigures will drive collectors and people to purchase the set who are not even interested in the model (who wouldn&#39;t be?) which is pretty sad if you ask me. I got it purely for the model; the minifigures and stand are bonuses! They both can be displayed on a sleek and simple display stand with the information plaque in the centre which has many different stats and information about the vehicle. I like that The Dark Knight logo isn&#39;t placed at the top of the plaque, were it could have been cheesy. The plaque is instead titled &#39;Wayne Industries - Applied Science Division&#39; which makes more sense as the Tumbler was known for all its cool facts and makes the model feel authentic. This is my first set with a display stand and plaque so I can say it took about 15-20 minutes to get the sticker right but it did catch some dust after multiple times so I have very few bumps on the stand but it&#39;s very minor. I like that it&#39;s not that sticky as other stickers which made it much easier to apply.</p>

<p>The Christian Bale Batman is based on the Batman Begins suit since we have already got The Dark Knight Rises one in 2013. I&#39;m really digging the level of details on the front and back of the torso; it&#39;s very movie accurate and doesn&#39;t look cartoony which 2013 one did. The most disappointing part about this minifigure is the lack of leg and arm printing, if this was based off a comic version of Batman it wouldn&#39;t be a problem but the fact it&#39;s not as detailed as the Marvel movie variants it&#39;s really disappointing for such a large set. Batman comes with a Batarang but it&#39;s the one that we have always had, I would have liked an exclusive Dark Knight Batarang instead. The main highlight for this set is the first ever Heath Ledger Joker who has been a fan requested minifigure for a very long time. He is pretty much perfect unlike Batman; he has a detailed torso and legs. I really like that just front of the head has white faded printing to give it the face paint effect, whereas normally he has a white head instead. His smirk is so sinister. I&#39;m not sure if the Earth Blue hands are accurate. Like the Batman minifigure he also doesn&#39;t come with an exclusive accessory but at least Batman came with one but the Joker doesn&#39;t have anything; maybe an exclusive knife or Joker card would have been cool. I have put the pair of very precious minifigures free from dust so they are not on the display stand but it still does look good without them.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
Besides rolling it backwards and forwards, several adjustable flaps, some movable interior details and the two sections of the removable roof it doesn&#39;t have anything else. It&#39;s hasn&#39;t got is primary features from the movie; those being an ejectable Bat-Pod, opening doors and steering. I understand and can see that the main goal was to get all those angles and shapes that we see on the actual Tumbler which the designer at LEGO has achieved. It&#39;s such a shame as it would have completed the model but I guess LEGO have given the fans an opportunity to modify the model and do it ourselves. I must say that getting its wheels to turn and motorize it must be really difficult. Not to mention ejecting a Bat-Pot from the model. Maybe there is a person out there who could figure it all out and make it work successfully and keep all the great angles and shapes Adam has put into the model. I had problems with adding the sub-assemblies during the end since they can be fragile which means it&#39;s not recommend for play.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong><br />
This set contains 18 numbered bags (1-11.) This set contains five instruction booklets and two sticker sheets which come in a cardboard sleeve to keep them straight. To note, I got an extra sheet of the smaller stickers for some odd reason? Really, for a set this size they could have made it into a thick square bound book like they have done with a few sets already and included some facts about the movie vehicle and the LEGO design process.</p>

<p>Boy was very challenging, I really enjoyed the build, it took me around 8 hours to build which was very surprising since most people took about 4-5 hours; it&#39;s very different to the models I normally build which are rather simple like the Modular Buildings. It takes a while to build the main frame of the model but after that it quickly comes together with many sub-assemblies. I understand that most of the time man made things are symmetrical so this had a mirrored build and it does get slightly repetitive but at least I didn&#39;t see more than &#39;x2&#39; in the instructions. I had a hard time attaching the front wheel assembly that attaches to the Technic panel; it took some time to actually make it stay on since it&#39;s held on with many studs. I also found out that the design could have easily made that area stronger with a few of Connector Peg W. Knob; we get loads of extras of those so it&#39;s not really a problem. I also thought a few more of Slide Shoe Round 2X2 could have been used to make some of the assemblies much stronger like the chairs. The stickers where the only down side to the build which slightly stressed me out but I found out that sticking a corner of the sticker on the back of the actual sticker sheet makes it much easier and fingerprint proof. The main frame is very study when complete but like I said the sub-assemblies are the weak areas in terms of stability but I don&#39;t know how else it would have been possible. What makes this model different from many other LEGO models is that you cannot easily tell how it&#39;s built; due to all the non-linear shapes and angles achieved throughout the model. I can say we do have two elements in the front wheels which are visible, that&rsquo;s not intentionally part of the design but that fact that only the black is visible throughout the whole with a few hints of grey and gold details; normally we would have exposed blue or red LEGO Technic pins which normally takes away from most LEGO models but in this case it&#39;s only very minor which is great for a model at this scale.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong><br />
This retails for &pound;159.99 in the UK and contains 1869 pieces. The price shocked me; then I saw the designer video and was impressed with the size; now that I own it I can say it&rsquo;s damn huge. It&#39;s beauty is the size and details; just speechless. The Dark Knight and Batman fans will really appreciate this model, it delivers a different and educational build experience, compared to your average set as it&rsquo;s aimed towards adults and collectors. The other day I checked the price for the Tyre Wide &Oslash;81,6X44 &nbsp;and I discovered that they are on the LEGO Bricks and Pieces feature and they go for about &pound;8 each! Now I can understand why the set costs so much, the large tires must be very hard to make and manufacture so therefore the price reflects that. I added all the tires and rims and it came out close to &pound;40. What this means is it would have cost &pound;120 without the tires and rims. You have to understand that&#39;s the main reason why the set costs so much. Just like real cars. I plan to buy two more for a Bat-Pod MOC in scale with this Tumbler.</p>

<p><strong>Theme Popularity</strong><br />
LEGO Batman sets always to well and this will make a great collector&rsquo;s item.</p>

<p><strong>Exclusivity</strong><br />
This set is available at LEGO Stores and Shop.LEGO.com and other selected retailers. Surprisingly it&rsquo;s still listed 1 per customer online which means resellers will be upset and tells us that there is limited availability.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong><br />
I like the fact they changed the colour of the banner for this set and made is a mix of grey and black. The way they presented the model is just like it&#39;s jumped off the screen. On the back of the box we see a main image of the model in the basement, and just below it we have several technical views of the Tumbler. The back also gives us a good look at the interior which is pretty much impossible to see once built.</p>

<p><strong>Growth Potential</strong><br />
This will do very well as an investment just because LEGO Batman has always done well in the secondary market plus the popularity of The Dark Knight will make it stand out. I can see its price tripled when it&#39;s discontinued since LEGO has limited one per customer on Shop.LEGO.com.</p>

<p><strong>Display Attributes</strong><br />
Yes, this is a great collector&rsquo;s item and display piece with minor flaws like: It&#39;s hasn&#39;t got is primary features from the movie; those being an ejectable Bat-Pod, opening doors and steering. I understand and can see that the main goal was to get all those angles and shapes that we see on the actual Tumbler which the designer at LEGO has achieved. The model looks how you would expect it to look, it&rsquo;s definitely looks like a Tumbler and is instantly recognisable; it&#39;s not a very pretty model as it&#39;s a military tank therefore it&#39;s won&#39;t be target to some individuals who like models from LEGO Creator Expert but it&#39;s a great and cool vehicle and a great addition to any LEGO Batman collection. It would be a nightmare dusting this model as it has many different angles whilst using elements with visible studs. Whist having all those studs showing takes away from the Tumbler look and looks like random selections of elements put together; one way they should have avoid this if they tiled the entire model, but it would have greatly affected the RRP making it harder for us and costs to make new molds and colours would have been as issue for LEGO. So in a nutshell it had to be done like this. The back view is its most comfortable and standout area in the entire model. The tires are another standout in the set they are so sleek; I wouldn&#39;t want those catching any dust! I can see people modifying this in &lsquo;5 - Brick Yellow&rsquo; and &lsquo;138 - Sand Yellow&rsquo; for the Tumblers used in The Dark Knight Rises, it would take quite a bit of planning to accomplish. I would have liked some lights included but they are not really necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Final Analysis/ Conclusion</strong><br />
Overall this set it is a must have set for every Batman or The Dark Knight fan. If you&rsquo;re a LEGO collector of cars this will also be a unique model and it will stand out from other LEGO cars since it&#39;s probably one of the biggest car or vehicle of this scale. This set has two unique and exclusive minifigures so if you&rsquo;re a Batman fan it&rsquo;s defiantly worth. It also leaves you hanging to try and modify it because it wasn&#39;t realistic enough for the designers to get all its primary features into a model of this size but purely as a display pieces it defiantly triumphs as a model and stands out to the other exclusives that are currently available. This set is a best seller so get your hands on it while you can! Hopefully with the success of&nbsp;this set we get a UCS&nbsp;Batmobile from Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice next year!</p>

<p>I just took it out of storage and thanks to heavy handling techniques I needed to rebuild the majority again and wow, the experience has just reinvigorated my regards for the set and the designer!!</p>

<p>The techniques used are crazy to provide the finished model with a look that more than captures the iconic film&#39;s vehicle. Its clever, fiddly, frustrating and mainly black but aside lots of large scale models, the build is engrossing</p>

<p>It has no playability in the slightest - it&#39;s&nbsp;a display model that has my work colleagues in agreement - its cool</p>
