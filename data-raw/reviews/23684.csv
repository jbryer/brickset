"richselby","2014-08-03T11:54:41.773Z","Exo-Suits You, Sir!","<p>Perhaps the most anticipated Lego set of the year. But did it live up to the hype?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instruction booklet borrows&nbsp;the Lego&nbsp;Architecture aesthetic, i.e. white-on-black text,&nbsp;in a slim square bound volume. There&#39;s a decent introduction (repeated in several languages), &nbsp;complete with a picture of Pete Reid (Lego Ideas)&nbsp;&nbsp;and Mark Stafford (TLG Designer). It&#39;s good to see both their contributions acknowledged. Then there&#39;s two pages of sci-fi&nbsp;story (again, in several languages)&nbsp;to give the suit a bit of context, which you can take or leave. &nbsp;And then of course the actual building&nbsp;instructions which are clear and easy to follow. Just like in the Architecture range, the instructions are interspersed with thumbnail pics and factoids, e.g. &quot;twin exhaust pipes&quot;.&nbsp;It seems odd to me the thumbnails are not on the appropriate building page, but that&#39;s a small complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>When you tip the parts on the table, you think &quot;WTF is this?&quot; &nbsp;The part inventory looks like no other Lego set <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">I have ever seen, </span>be&nbsp;it&nbsp;System, Technic or Bionicle. Just lots of really small fiddly&nbsp;parts, and some funny ball axle elements to join them all together.</p>

<p>The largest element is a 2 x 6 plate, and that is not very large at all, especially when you consider the size of the complete model.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">If you&#39;re approaching this set&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">without&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">preconce</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">ptions</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">, I suspect the figures will&nbsp;</span>underwhelm<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">.&nbsp;Just one plain logo on the torso, no leg or back printing.&nbsp;</span>If you&#39;re old (or nerdy) enough to feel a touch of nostalgia for the Classis Space era, you will be instantly wowed by the green classic space figures. Like Classic Space, but green. Back in ye olden days, these figs came in white, red, yellow, blue and black. So &#39;green&#39; expands the Classic Space universe, whilst staying true to it. (Provided you can overlook the helmet style. Classic Space figures had slender straight-sided&nbsp;helmets.&nbsp;These guys have rounded motorcycle-style&nbsp;crash helmets. Yet curiously no motorcycles.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It takes longer than expected. &nbsp;It&#39;s fun. And it&#39;s unorthodox. Usually when I build, I look at the picture of the sub assembly, pull out the parts, and just go for it. This time I needed to resort to the step-by-step pictures, which really made for an enjoyable build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks as good in real life as it does on the box. Highly poseable. Love the big grippy claws.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to say my kids (aged 5 and 9) also loved it. They don&#39;t have any fondness&nbsp;for Classic Space, but within a few moments, decided it was a headless Decepticon, which was good enough to keep them amused for hours.</p>

<p>The one problem is that some of the greebly&nbsp;bits fall off in play, particularly the old-style droid arms. They seem to be made of a softer than usual plastic, with poor clutch.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Wonderful. I have no problem in recommending this set to all Lego fans. In fact - er,&nbsp;please sir, &nbsp;can we have some more like this. Please?</p>

"tkettle9719","2014-08-11T05:05:54.663Z","LEGO Ideas 21109: Exo Suit Review","<p>The time has come: this year&#39;s most anticipated set, the Exo Suit, is now flying off shelves and the internet, with everyone in the community joining in the Neo-Classic Space frenzy this year. Peter Reid waited to share his masterpiece with the world for nearly three&nbsp;years, and&nbsp;his advertising and frankly magnificent piece of art paid off, making&nbsp;his dream of mass producing a Lego masterpiece&nbsp;a reality. And boy, has Mark Stafford, due to his partnership&nbsp;with Pete, made this set a standout model for display. To put it simply, this more than does justice for a replication of the original Exo Suit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set was not a dream come true&nbsp;for everyone, though, it seems. And that is something I&#39;d really like to emphasize: the people that are receiving their Exo Suits are very lucky.&nbsp;After about two hours of constant refreshing and waiting on Lego Shop, my order finally pulled through, and the Exo Suit was purchased, with shipping confirmed the next day. As of the time of writing, the set is currently out of stock, with no current knowledge on when&nbsp;it will eventually be restocked. And none of this is the fault of the customers; Lego really needs to get their act together with these kind of specialty sets; temporary servers, increased stock of&nbsp;supply to meet the demand, etc. Part of every review is the experience and, frankly, this experience was difficult for me, and impossible for many. And this isn&#39;t the only time this has happened with an Ideas set; it was the same issue for the Curiosity Rover and the Research Institute released at the same time.&nbsp;I hope this teaches Lego about the importance of meeting demand, because this fiasco, and the similar events above, are&nbsp;embarrassments to the company. Although this issue is not reflected in my ratings of the actual set, I will say that this is something that the Lego Group needs to fix.&nbsp;With that said, let&#39;s talk about the Exo Suit, shall we?</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>-Where to begin? The first really great thing about this kit, especially considering that it is an Ideas kit, is that it has a ton of rare parts, something I didn&#39;t expect to see. Among the many new parts are: transparent green 1x1 round tiles, (light gray hub caps, telescopes, heads, inverted domes, 1x2 bricks with 4 knobs,&nbsp;disks, and a flex hose),&nbsp;(silver dishes and rocket points), (green oxygen bottles, mid-90s helmets (not the original space helmets), and&nbsp;spacesuits), a black walkie talkie, (dark gray bow plates, barrels, and ball cups), an inverted flat tile with a furnace printed on, and a yellow round 2x2 tile. Lots of variety, and a few other pieces not in the inventory on the site, make sure that the Exo Suit is always an interesting, creative, and certainly never dull&nbsp;build.</p>

<p>-So now we work chronologically with the set: and first thing&#39;s first: the minifigures. The two characters in here, Pete and Yve (convenient&nbsp;names, I must say) are amazing; while they use reused faces (which is never a bad thing), the real attraction is the green space suits. This brings the tally up to five colors, I think; red, yellow, blue, white, and green. The new helmet is actually greatly appreciated, and the green is a fantastic choice that really SUITS the mech well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The robot turtle is built next, and boy is it...pointless? No; and actually, quite the opposite. In fact, it&#39;s a great addition to the model. Another of the famous creations of Mr. Reid, his turtles are a magnificent addition to the set, providing a little pet of sorts for the two adventurers. The guns are a smart design, the legs are ingenious, and it&#39;s just a little ball of fun. And, FYI, I named my little buddy RoboSquirtle; the metallic parts really complete it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The small platform with the barrels is also a nice little play feature; the Exo Suit removes the barrels, holding one in each hand, while it stands on the platform. The barrels are well-designed, rather plain and generic, but it works fine here; as will be seen later, they fit very snugly and comfortably in the hands of the Exo Suit, making them a great way to get some form of playability out of the kit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-First off, WOW! This kit looks incredible. I &nbsp;was sort of unsure about how this would come out due to the first few pictures of the kit looking a bit off on the box photo, but the comparison photo of the original and the actual kit puts to rest any anger as to the official set version. Many of the original touches remain, such as the claws, arms, and the processing units, but the set makes necessary&nbsp;adjustments to make it look thicker, stronger, and generally more&nbsp;a real Lego set rather than a fragile work of art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The Exo suit is not meant to be particularly colorful; in fact, the genius behind the original was that the old model was very monotone, so it could hide some of the illegal maneuvers it took to make the original such a beautiful piece of art. However, Lego, with their &quot;legal&quot; build, can take some liberties, and does so very responsibly in two ways: the contrast of grays, with the dark, the light, and the silver, is fantastic and realistic; although the main color is the light gray, the other colors help the model to really pop and emphasize detail. The other great color decision is the addition of transparent yellow in the feet and on the cockpit; I feel as though the model is much more lively and active with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Once the finished product is made, the Suit really doesn&#39;t feel fragile; with Peter Reid&#39;s original, I would never touch it. It looks like an&nbsp;extremely fragile work of art, and touching it would be unethical in a number of ways. With the official model, however, many creative uses of pieces make sure this model is stable. Ball joints are used as intended, but their employment is necessary&nbsp;here. The barrels on the arms, in my opinion, work quite well to hide what&#39;s going on inside of them, and look good anyway. The hub caps and dishes on the feet give the model intricate detail, and the various power and processing builds give the model a realistic feel. The whole model is just creative and smart, and it&#39;s just as sturdy and strong as it is detailed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>-One of the big problems with this set, and I know I&#39;m not alone in this, is the fiddlyness of some of the builds. While most of the set set outline is incredibly well-done, I can&#39;t help but feel that it has some noticeably difficult mini-build going on, such as the processing units on the arms and the bottoms of the legs. Those two parts of the build are excruciatingly difficult.&nbsp;While I like a challenge in sets, I&#39;m also a bit of a perfectionist, and I could never really get those two parts right. They are very fiddly, and will likely never be perfect. You have been warned, perfectionists.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-This is not a set for kids; sure, it looks fun, but the Exo Suit is not a model for children. While the box calls this a &quot;building toy&quot;, this is definitely more of a small display model, along the lines of something from UCS or the modular builds line. The main reason to not let children get close to an Exo Suit (besides greediness and fragility on the small details) is that there&#39;s not really much to do with the Exo Suit. Sure, you can make it do amazing things with its hands and do some fantastic poses, but it does little beyond that. Of course, there&#39;s no real point to, but this is not something for the kiddos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The whole setup and creation of the official Exo Suit is great; well thought-out, a faithful adaptation, and surprisingly close to the original in many aspects. Unfortunately, the one part of the build that is not in any way faithful is the cage cockpit. I don&#39;t dislike this one; it&#39;s also inventive in its use of handlebars for the cockpit; however, the original was very tight-fitting and seemed to me, at least, something that could have been adapted a little bit more easily. With so much faithfulness to the original model, it&#39;s just a little bit overwhelming to see the model this different.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Like every set I own, I would change a few things on this model, particularly the cage (if you can tell, the adaptation was a little much for my tastes); yet, I believe that Mark Stafford and Peter Reid have made something very special, and I am humbled to own the collaboration that these two have produced. A couple years ago, I could never imagine something like the Exo Suit even being an idea (no pun intended) to produce. But sometimes, a rare chance comes along that changes lives and promotes an entirely new model. And that&#39;s what Lego Ideas is all about. Now, Lego fans all over the world can celebrate the release of what is hopefully the first set in a line of Neo-Space sets (hint, hint, LEGO!) and take it all back to the beginning. If you have the chance (and hopefully you will sieze that chance&nbsp;if Lego decides to actually meet the demand for this masterpiece), then purchase it immediately. Don&#39;t hesitate; I can tell that this will be gone before you have the time to make a decision on it. It&#39;s worth every penny.&nbsp;</p>

"Chills","2014-10-10T15:52:47.107Z","A set like no other","<p><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">It&#39;s been about 2 years since my last review. I&#39;ve been busy with a new house, new baby, etc, but I&#39;m back!</span></p>

<p>I&#39;d been watching the LEGO Ideas sets and while some were interesting, none captured my attention like the Exo-Suit. Pete&#39;s submission looked great, and I was one of the early voters for it. I&#39;m quite pleased that it was chosen for production. However, I was disappointed to find out how quickly the set sold out on Shop@Home, both first and second runs. Both eBay and Amazon had sets for sale, but at much higher prices. But I was patient. After a couple of months&nbsp;I was finally able to nab this set in one of the moments on Amazon when it was selling for RRP. So my excitement for the Exo-Suit was renewed!</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>When the Exo-Suit arrived at my doorstep I was excited, and the feeling only grew when I handled the box. It is beautiful, with fun images of the suit in use on the front and back; along with the battle turtle, and Pete and Yve. My wife joked that Pete is doing the work while Yve is telling him what to do. Quite the realistic relationship. lol</p>

<p>The coolest thing about the box is that it is has a&nbsp;flip open top. This detail, while not exactly the same,&nbsp;brings me back to my childhood days of LEGO set boxes with flip up lids where you could see the parts under a transparent piece of plastic.</p>

<p>The instruction book is just that, an actual book with a spine. There is a story in front about Pete, Yve, and the suit, and the instructions are next. The printing is very detailed, which is necessary due to the small parts used in the set. Most pages also have a spot which highlights a design element of the suit or the turtle, further showing the amount of detail LEGO put into the production of the suit.</p>

<p>The only thing about the instructions is that you need some bright light to read them well. The background is dark and the pieces are all shades of grey.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I am predominately a Star Wars collector since coming out of my Dark Ages, so when I opened this set up and saw the multitude of tiny pieces I was in awe. There are SO many itty bitty pieces to this set; in fact the largest piece is a 2x6 plate. The rest of the parts are very small technic pieces. Most are shades of grey, but you do get some pearl grey pieces, which I think are pretty cool and add a bit of neat detail to the monochromatic build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not much of a MOCer, so I don&#39;t know how well these pieces could be used for other creations. I will say that I now have pieces I&#39;ve never had before. Another plus for this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>When I was a kid I loved the classic space sets. Pete and Yve really brought me back to those days. They do not have the real old-school helmets, but the figures are still classic space in my book. And they are green! I&#39;ve never seen a green space figure before, they may have existed, but this is my first. Two&nbsp;great additions to my collection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Here is where I was really blown away by this set. The build was unlike anything I&#39;ve ever done before. Since the Exo-Suit is composed of tons of tiny technic pieces it uses techniques I&#39;ve not seen in the other sets in my collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build consists of quite a few mini-builds, which are all pretty straight forward. With all of the tiny pieces sometimes the build felt like it wouldn&#39;t be a very sturdy set, and would fall apart, but it holds together quite well. I will admit that my thick fingers had a bit of trouble with some of the sections, but one just has to be patient with the tiny pieces.</p>

<p>There&#39;s only one section that I felt could have been more solid, the small covers for the shoulder fronts. They are cool looking, but tend to pop off if not handled carefully.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once finished the Exo-Suit is quite sturdy, even though it looks like it might be fragile. It also has all of the joints one could want to make it playable: shoulder, wrist, finger, hip, knee, ankle, etc. It is quite pose-able;&nbsp;you can do much playing with it, and it&#39;ll stay together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really like all of the detail, each tiny piece looks like it has a function in the suit. The overall feel is very mechanical, but elegant. Pete or Yve fit snuggly in the cockpit. I like how LEGO added the battle turtle (which is pretty cute) and the barrels and platform. These small features add quite a bit of playability to the set. The Exo-Suits&nbsp;hands easily grasp the barrels; and can hold onto other things, like if Pete decides to pick Yve up so she doesn&#39;t have to walk back to base.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is just a fantastic set, with all of the details one could want from a classic space set. You can really see that LEGO put a lot of thought into the whole package, from the box, to&nbsp;the instruction book, to&nbsp;the build and the actual set. I&#39;m very pleased that they stayed close to Pete&#39;s original design, too.</p>

<p>This set has it all, from playability, to cool parts, a VERY unique build, and fun minifigures. I think LEGO has done a fantastic job with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am happy I bought it, and even more so that I found it for RRP even though it wasn&#39;t on Shop@Home. If you&#39;re on the fence about this set, I say get it! You won&#39;t be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

"Mattg821","2015-02-01T15:58:43.93Z","Lego Ideas have done it again.","<p>This is my&nbsp;third Ideas set and I have&nbsp;&nbsp;yet to be let down (I&nbsp;like BTTF too much ).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Once again well presented and makes you feel like your purchasing something a bit more special than your average set. hefty manual with story and the work in this one is a joy to behold. There is a back story and everything.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I read one review that said something about how on opening the box they thought it looked like a load of spares and I agree it does look like the leftovers after building the death star. Though you dont&nbsp;judge a book by its cover I did think hows this going to come together. That said good selection of parts. I would love to see someones alternate build.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>classic space in green,nice. Some seem disappointed&nbsp;with the newer style helmet but i think the old style wouldnt&nbsp;suit.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Bought this on Saturday and saved it till Sunday morning to build. Big mistake ive got one kid on one side of the table building Mixels&nbsp;and the other asking me to build the Heartlake&nbsp;school. So next time i will wait till after bedtime. The way it comes together is good and I dont think two legs or arms are repetitive. The detail is fantastic.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Lego Mech suit=Awesome. looks awesome from any angle. Ive seen loads of reviews and read blocks mag and compared it to the original design and I think its superb.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Just had a battle with some Mixels and two kids playing with the suit and it did ok. The shoulder greebling&nbsp;is a bit loose but some say lightsaber rods can be used to strengthen them.If you are only displaying this then it will be fine. If you like lego space you need this set. The robot turtle is pretty awesome aswell.</p>

Both together are a first, LEGO Classic Space in green, and a huge draw for fans of Classic Space. A shame they didn&rsquo;t recast some actual classic space helmets for the duo as that would have made them both perfect to blend in with LEGO Classic Space sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

You can dump the bag or bags into the box and just sift through them like a jigsaw and build your model.

"DrFrankenstein","2015-12-19T19:52:03.057Z","Back into space","<p>The Exo Suit is hands down the best set that the LEGO IDEAS crowd-sourced experiment has produced to date in my book. This model strikes the right notes of nostalgia, coolness, and innovation without being condescending or pretentious.</p>

<p>The moment you take a look at the box, you will know that this is not your typical LEGO fare. The beautiful artwork will immediately appeal to any sci-fi fan with the deep-blue color of the box and the sand dune landscape providing a throwback to the box design of the orignal LEGO space sets from the early 80s. The cardboard, booklet, and print quality are a step up from the norm for LEGO products adding to the impression that you are getting something that stands apart (much like the Architecture theme). The booklet presents gives a nice introduction to the set with background on the LEGO space theme, the designers, and an open-ended space cadet story to set up the characters&#39; universe.</p>

<p>The build is a bit fiddly with lots of tiny seemingly random parts from a variety of themes. Building the turtle is quick and fun (nice creative use of parts here), but the exo suit will test your patience. Getting the parts to stay in place is requires a fine touch to say the least.</p>

<p>The finished model looks nice overall. The little turtle robot is cute. The nice part about the exo suit is that is is poseable with its many joints. The bad part is that many of the decorative parts are barely held together and pop out at the slightest move or touch. To me this is more of a display model than something that a young child could play with. I am sure though that it holds together much better than the original design proposal that it is based on.</p>

<p>For me, however, the highlight of the set are the minifigures. Who ever does not love classic space people with their helmets and gas cylinders (even if they look more like scuba equipment than true space suits)? Add the unique green color which has never been used before for these minifigres, which looks very cool. And end with the female astronaut, which is another first for the theme. Does it ever get better than this?</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-02-10T01:25:18.71Z","A Modern Classic","<p>Here&#39;s PicnicBasketSam again, reviewing another of his Christmas haul! I got this one looking through a LEGO Store on Christmas Eve with a $50 CAD gift card, and lo and behold: One lonely Exo-Suit, hidden behind an Ultra Agents display. I dropped the Protectors I was holding and grabbed it without a second thought, and let me just tell you now: it was absolutely worth it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is really small, about $20 normal size. But it opens like a pizza box and is very classy&nbsp;with thick, black cardboard. The contents: One thick bound instruction book with equal classiness and a handful of bags full of small grey greebly bits. Yummy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>321 grey greebly bits, with hints of transparent colors here and there, a bucketload of Technic, and green Classic Space figure parts. Some of the best&nbsp;parts include 10 silver robot arms, Friends handlebars, green classic space torsos and airtanks, inverted domes, round tiles with holes in the middle, and assorted greebles. Great for alternate models; I was able to make half of a TIE Fighter, Classic Space-styled from this.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two classic space people, in green. Awesome in their simplicity.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pleasantly long and tricky, just like it should. Some repetition in the limbs, but that is to be expected.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s beautiful. A little platform with barrels, a slightly modded Peter Reid Robo-Turtle, and this slice of awesomeness... I mean, uh, mech. It&#39;s got detail through the roof and poseability through the replacement roof erected 20 feet above the previous one. Plenty of fun to be had here.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s spectacular, and certainly on the Top 5 Best Sets of 2014. It&#39;s tons of fun, a great display model, a great parts pack, and it has some very popular minifigs. There&#39;s something to be had for every single type of LEGO fan imaginable. If you don&#39;t have one, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re reading this for. I can&#39;t stress the awesomeness of this set enough. GET AT LEAST ONE OF THESE THINGS RIGHT NOW!</p>

<p>(Side note: I paid $45 Canadian for this set. That&#39;s a bit much for anything else with a similar part count, but I&#39;m not going to be all judgemental now. Cynicism is saved for the junky sets.)</p>
