"FlagsNZ","2014-08-17T09:00:07.197Z","A fantastic new theme for Lego","<p>As soon as I saw this set heading for Project Review I hoped that it would be accepted by Lego.</p>

<p>It was the astronomy theme that hooked me.</p>

<p>I was drawn to the originality of this Idea and impressed that it was not based on a licensed theme.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>There is something special about the Ideas box. It is printed black inside which makes it seem different than regular Lego boxes.</p>

<p>The instruction book is also of a superior quality. It is a stapled booklet printed on better quality paper.</p>

<p>The first page introduces Dr&nbsp;Ellen Kooijman (Alatariel), the designer of this Ideas set&nbsp;with a good photo of her working in her&nbsp;laboratory.</p>

<p>It was&nbsp;Ellen Kooijman&#39;s&nbsp;aim to &quot;increase the overall number of&nbsp;female Lego figures&nbsp;and to make them more interesting as charcters.&quot; I believe&nbsp;she has successfully achieved this with her Research Institute set.</p>

<p>I have placed a male minifigure as a research&nbsp;assistant in the vignettes.</p>

<h3>Chemist</h3>

<p>The first vignette is that of a chemist. It has a lab bench with draws and a cupboard filled with equipment.</p>

<p>The bench has a stand&nbsp;for Erlenmeyer flasks, chemical bottles, beakers,&nbsp;glasses and pipettes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5589/15027858965_67fea75a5d.jpg"" /></p>

<p>These pages of the instructions have a couple of organic chemical chains as the watermark.</p>

<h3>Palaeontologist</h3>

<p>The second vignette is a palaeontologist.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3918/14939865071_6970bf32d2.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This comes with a microscope and a dinosaur skeleton. I call this a Legosaurus rex (Rex is&nbsp;Latin for king, Regina is queen).</p>

<p>I like the brick built dinosaur.</p>

<p>I have spent a day building a Tricerablocks and Ptechnicdactyl.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3879/14942582032_014ac57ca9.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There is a Triceratops and Tyrannosaurus rex&nbsp;in the watermark on these instruction pages.</p>

<h3>Astronomer</h3>

<p>The astronomer has an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altazimuth_mount"">alt/azimuth</a> telescope and a smart board showing several constellations.</p>

<p>Embedded in the telescope is a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4217675"">sextant</a>. Until quite recently, I didn&#39;t know that Lego had a sextant piece.</p>

<p>I teach celestial navigation which is the art of using a sextant and chronometer&nbsp;to determine your geographic&nbsp;position. It is a dying art and has largely been made redundant due to&nbsp;GPS however there is some satisfaction in being able to demonstrate this skill.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3912/14939865471_44d1549c3a.jpg"" /></p>

<p>For once, I was not expecting a piece to be printed. The smart board has <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(constellation)"">Gemini</a>&nbsp;(the twins), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_Minor"">Canis Minor</a>&nbsp;(lesser dog), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auriga_(constellation)"">Auriga</a> (the charioteer), <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(constellation)"">Taurus</a> (the bull)&nbsp;and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orion_(constellation)"">Orion</a> (the hunter)&nbsp;constellations&nbsp;printed on it. I use <a href=""http://www.stellarium.org/"">Stellarium</a>, a free&nbsp;open source&nbsp;planetarium for your computer to project celestial information in the classroom similar to the way it is shown in this set.</p>

<p>I will be purchasing several <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/617926"">4x4 plates with four knobs</a> from <a href=""http://shop.lego.com/en-NZ/Pick-A-Brick-ByTheme"">Pick a Brick</a>&nbsp;so that I have some different constellations to display. I will make my own sticker graphics to match the theme in this set.</p>

<p>I feel that the telescope in this set is not befitting a role at a&nbsp;research institute.&nbsp;I have spent a day trying to make some other examples of telescopes. It is somewhat difficult to make tripods with Lego at the minifigure scale. Here is an attempt to make an&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_mount"">equatorial</a> mount.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5577/14756263319_077f1051bd.jpg"" /></p>

<p>A common low cost telescope is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dobsonian_telescope"">Dobsonian&nbsp;telescope</a>&nbsp;designed by John Dobson.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3873/14942581322_57b6a3224b.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The instruction pages for the astronomer has two constellations as a watermark,&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Major"">Ursa Major</a>&nbsp; (big bear) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursa_Minor"">Ursa Minor</a> (little bear). These are sometimes known as Big and Little Dipper. Ursa Minor contains <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris"">Polaris</a>, the pole star.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I have really enjoyed this build. I have enjoyed creating dinosaurs and have several designs in mind. It has so much potential.</p>

<p>There is a <a href=""https://ideas.lego.com/projects/74885"">Fossil Museum</a> on Lego Ideas that would clearly compliment this set. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I hope that this set will be the catalyst for a new theme for Lego. I feel that this is the starting point for a Research&nbsp;Institute or University building. As this must include an observatory, the building should not be in the city due to the effects of&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution"">light pollution</a>.</p>

<p>The Research Institute could be modelled on the&nbsp;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Academy_of_Sciences"">California Academy of Sciences</a> in the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Gate_Park"">Golden Gate Park</a>, San Francisco.</p>

<p>This could be the start of a modular Park theme for Lego.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set. I hope Lego use this open source Ideas process to design future sets. I think it has more potential as it is not linked to any other license and therefore will draw in a larger audience.</p>

<p>The overall star of this set is the brick&nbsp;built&nbsp;dinosaur.</p>

<h3>How to have fun with plastic dinosaur toys</h3>

<p>While it is not Lego, someone has had some fun with a little plastic dinosaur toy and I think it fits in with this theme.</p>

"brunonowak","2015-01-03T19:53:00.663Z","Unique inspiring Ideas set especially for parents of girls","<p>I was finally able to buy and build the Research Institute. At the time of this review I have an 8YO girl and as the parent of a girl that gets bombarded with stereotypes about what girls are supposed to be like in childhood and adulthood it is very cool and refreshing to see a set like this come to life.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is well designed, with higher end materials and finish as is the standard for Lego Ideas sets. The instructions are also the high end booklet with an introduction about the ideator and details about each of the professions &quot;depicted&quot; in the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are only a few unique parts in this set from my experience:</p>

<p>- The printed blackboard for the Astronomer</p>

<p>- The Erlenmeyer flasks for the Chemist (you get a green and a purple one)</p>

<p>Besides those there are quite a few rare parts in interesting colors like the pieces that make up the telescope and the skeleton. You also get some 1x1 tiles and a few interesting transparent ones for the Chemist lab.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All 3 minifigures are very detailed and only the Astronomer doesn&#39;t get any back print. All 3 minifigs have two different faces (on calm/concentrated the other one worried/stressed). I really like the way the prints are done as they depict different dressing styles for different professions making (my interpretation) the point that you can have your own personal style in any profession of your choice (most of the time).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun and the set came in a bag for each of the professions. The one I liked the most was the Paleontologist as the dinosaur&#39;s skeleton was a lot of fun to build and understand the pieces used to present such an accurate and good looking specimen in such a small scale. Kudos to <a href=""https://ideas.lego.com/profile/Alatariel/projects"">Alatariel</a> for that.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once you&#39;re finished with the build you can play a bit with it (especially if you have kids or are a kid yourself - regardless of age above 5-6YO) and there&#39;s plenty of opportunity for roleplay and interaction with other sets or MOCs you may have (I can see myself playing with my daughter with the 3 scientists going to a conference using the airport set we have). It would be harded to include this in play with Friends sets (which my daughter really likes) due to the different minifig sizes but I guess that is ok and expected.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great &quot;starter&quot; set into the Science and Research fields for Lego that left me wanting more. I hope the finished <a href=""https://ideas.lego.com/projects/46720"">Natural History Museum</a> fills that gap very soon. Highly recommended for kids to play with as much as for adults to have on display.</p>

Honestly like with most LEGO City based sets the design is simple and doesn&rsquo;t include anything unique, the torso print is single sided and may be brand new here, but the head being double-sided is I believe a re-use of prints found in the LEGO Movie theme.

Making a nice little Vignette for the Minifigure showing them interacting with each element. For this bag you are building the scene for the Chemist, which features a small work station, drawers and bottles soon to be filled with chemical brews for scientific study. The build is quick and easy to follow, there aren&rsquo;t any really tricky parts, which confuses me as to why this set was listed as only 10+ builders. Younger builders shouldn&rsquo;t have too many troubles with this first bag, the dinosaur skeleton might be a bit more troublesome though.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a very clever build, though not to scale considering the LEGO T-Rex piece is a much larger model. Perhaps the skeleton found by this paleontologist was of a juvenile, not yet fully grown. A microscope mini-model is also include for examining bones, it&rsquo;s a fast little build too with more SNOT techniques.</span></span></span></span></p>

The floor is made up of mostly alternating 1x1 tiles to simulated a tiled floor, it&rsquo;s a very nice technique that I haven&rsquo;t seen used often outside of Modulars.

I just adore the skeleton here because it is the largest use of pieces and includes very clever design elements. There are no visible studs in this build either except for inside the mouth and the eyes.

It&rsquo;s obviously meant for display only, which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing because all of the vignettes look great as display pieces. Unfortunately this means younger builders may not appreciate it as much as the older collectors. Considering it sold out relatively quickly however I&rsquo;d say this set is definitely a good one and one I would strongly recommend if you can find it.</span></span></span></span></p>

"DrFrankenstein","2015-12-19T18:39:26.27Z","More inspired than all of the Friends sets together","<p>When LEGO released the female scientists set (aka Research Institute), I managed to grab a copy as a gift to my scientist wife and it hit the spot perfectly. She very much enjoyed putting together the models in the set and liked very much the realistic portrayal of women working in research. The chemical lab in particular resembled very closely the lab that she works in.</p>

<p>The finished models look very nice and are different from each other (I haven&#39;t built the models in the set myself, so I can&#39;t comment on the built itself). Not only there is a lot of creative use of bricks in each model, but also the end results are stable and don&#39;t fall apart the moment one touches them. While my wife likes the chem lab the most (it had lots of beakers, syringes, and other props on the shelve and in the drawers), my favorite mini-set here is the dinosaur, which is really creative in its construction and parts use. The front support rod locks the skeleton in a stable position, just like a real museum display. Another nice part here is the magnifying glass held by the paleontologist, which actually contains a real lens.</p>

<p>The overall presentation of the set is very appealing. The box and booklet are printed on high-quality cardboard and paper - noticeably better than the usual LEGO products. I like how the booklet gives background on Dr. Ellen Kooijman and the scientific disciplines portrayed by the set. Definitely a nice gift set.</p>

<p>The Research Institute set is very unique and bold in its portrayal of working women. I don&#39;t think that I have seen anything similar amongst the LEGO products. While LEGO has a number of lines that are great for boys, its attempts to make themes for girls are not particularly inspired. The Friends theme, modeled after the Barbie and Bratz dolls universe, portrays life as a mix of pastel-colored beauty and leisure supporting the stereotype that &quot;all that girls want is fun&quot;. These sets have no hints of leadership, professional development, challenging the world. Fine if you are happy to go with the Disney princess flow, but certainly not something that will inspire your little princess to look beyond the castle. The Research Institute completely breaks this mold and gives a totally opposite take on what women are capable of. Now this is a set that parents can give their little girls knowing that it delivers inspired female role models, and keeps the bubble-headed bimbos away. I hope that LEGO releases more of these sets in the future.</p>
