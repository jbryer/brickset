"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-28T16:22:46Z","Brilliant!!","This is a very good set. Good for the price (maybe could be a &#163;5 cheaper) [+1]. The detail is definatley [+5]. The 'slammer' doesn't work that good so sorry... [-1]. The minifigs are good detail [+4]. The track is a bit short but you can add some more if you wantyed like I have [+1]. And that's my 10/10!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-30T19:04:57Z","Nice set but they should have used real train tracks","The subway car that comes with the set is fun to build and catches the look of a real NYC subway car even though it is no where near a model of one.  I don't know why Peter's newspaper editor/publisher is in the set but I like having him and his newspaper.  The subway motorman is nice too.  I would have liked some passengers for the train.  Spider-Man and Dr. Ock are also provided.  The slammer is dumb but it works.  The safety barriers and web covered towers do an okay job of stopping the train but I would have preferred a piece of Forest Hills subway station instead.  I haven't seen the movie yet - it just came out today, so perhaps the set mimics what happens in the movie.  The way Lego has you construct the train's railway results in a rather flimsy structure that is a very poor substitute for train tracks like those available in Lego's train sets.  I suspect that they did this to keep the cost down but I would have been willing to pay more for the real tracks.  In summary a nice set that could have been a 10 if Lego had used train set tracks instead of the flimsy solution provided.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-21T22:11:48Z","WOOHOO! nice!","Hey what a nice set! Very good indeed! It has Doc Ock, Spiderman, J. Jonah Jameson and a train conductor (4 minifigs! good)
The only bad parts are the fact that there are too many stickers (the printed bits on the side of the train and the signs on the barricades are stickers) and the new grays, but that's unchangeable (sadly)
I like the playability that's accurate to the movie (you launch the train at high speed down the track and stop it before it goes off the track with the webs). Including 9v track would make the set more expensive. It does have train wheels, only real small ones.
All in all, a real noce set that deserves an 8. 
P.S. If you have a magnifying glass, you can read the newspaper. Cool.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-21T10:28:33Z","Best Part of this Set is the Train Windows","Even purchasing this set on sale, I was rather disappointed. Aside from the nice quantity of train windows, roof, and three red chairs, the set doesn't offer too much more for the train enthusiast. 

The train is one whole brick too small and has no access (door) aside from lifting off the roof. I do, however, like the control lever which can be used on any train. The set definately should have used real train wheels (and 3 real straight tracks would have made it a whole lot better).

Understanding that this is a SpiderMan set, I'd rather just see a single subway car and Lego can keep the movie parts.

"LEGOmyeggo","2007-04-23T19:05:53.1Z","This set has its Pros &amp; Cons.","This set has pros and cons, they are as follows:
PROS:
Spider-Man's new darker color is nice.
Doc Ock &amp; The Subway Conductor are interesting. 
The subway is a great thing, and the black stop! and Danger! signs are useful, as is the web tower thing. 
It's nice that J. Jonah Jameson is included with a newspaper in his hand.
Nice new peachish skin minifigs, though! 
CONS:
This should have like two more subway cars, because this is the controls car, and only fits TWO passengers!
Track should be longer!
Smasher should be better, it falls apart!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-10-12T11:44:06.297Z","a pleasant building experience","i just built my copy of this set and i have to say: setting aside the aspect of the new colours (gray and minifig-flesh) there is hardly anything to complain about. this is a well designed, functional, not too small set that has a lot of interesting parts (3 types of windows, supports, big plates, cool minifigs...). those who like good models will enjoy building the train car, those who like to play will have fun with the slammer - i have no problem with it, it's quite stable even when hitting it hard.
so regarding spider-man-2-sets, it ranks right behind the phantastic boat shed 4856.

"hustla187","2008-10-22T18:44:17.093Z","Really Good For Spidey","This is an excellent set because you get Spiderman, Doctor Octopus, and the Daily Bugle guy. The newspaper piece is pretty cool and you don't see that very often. The train car is very cool and fun to play with. If you added more track with the train, you could react the scene in Spiderman 2 when Spiderman fights Doctor Octopus on the train. Overall, there is nothing wrong with this set and desrves a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
