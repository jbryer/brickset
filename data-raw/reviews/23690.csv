It fits well with the other outdoor sets from the Friends&#39; line. If you can&#39;t take your child camping, you can at least pretend you are playing outside with this accessory pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a very quick build and quite easy to assemble with the only bricks forming the tent floor. The tent itself is free standing and just attaches to the four bley&nbsp;pieces extending from the&nbsp;tent floor. The other accessories fit in well with the one pan stove and lantern being perfect. All they left out was a picnic table with benches or chairs. Where is Stephanie supposed to sit? And they forgot the bug spray, water purifier, sleeping bag and a hat with mosquito netting. And would Stephanie leave town without her cell phone and laptop...seriously?</p>

<p>For 15US, these other items could have been added. The price seems a bit high, but our family likes camping. So it was an easy decision using&nbsp;a 5US credit on my rewards account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this pushes&nbsp;your little ones towards camping, buy more than one! Thanks LEGO for pushing outdoor adventures, especially those for girls.&nbsp;</p>
