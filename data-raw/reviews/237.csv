"Novelty","2007-08-29T10:04:30.71Z","Cross - Off","This set contains of a structure with two crossbows and a shield attached, built atop a turntable thing and manned by a minifig.  There's almost no building to this set and the only movable part outside of the minifig is the turn-table.  Nevertheless it has some nice design points - the quiver on the back of the minifig for the crossbow and the lion shield in front protecting the minifig.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"United_Bricks","2011-09-03T17:41:41.803Z","Cool minfigure","This set came out as a promotion with Kabaya sweets in Japan. Its a nice little set, but don't spend to much buying this. You get one minifigure, which I think is cool. The arrow seat is nice, now on to the review.<br><br><br>The minfigure is nice, he is a good guy in the theam. His helmet is dark grey and is kind of rare, next is his head, his head is detailed with a mostache and hear with white highlights which I think is meant to make his hear look shiny. The torso is nice with armor printed on it, he has red arms. On his back he has a bag full of arrows. Finerly his legs are black with printing of armor on them, so this is a plus.<br>The arrowseat has two green 4x4 plates at the bottem, The arrowseat can move around, because it comes with a black plate with a round circle on top that moves around. You get two dark grey crossbows and a sheild with the knights kingdom logo on it.<br><br>Overall very good set. <br>",TRUE,3,3,2,4,4
