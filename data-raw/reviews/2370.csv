The set has a very nice piece selection including 7 smoked windows, brown 1x2s and columns, light grey bricks, a number of arches and slopes, and a nice assortment of large flat plates and round bricks (PIECES: 8). The hideout is nicely constructed with details that include a rickety front dock, a collapsing side wall, and a removable roof. What I don't like is the missing wall on left side (DESIGN: 7). The motor boat is simple but neat. In terms of (PLAYABILITY: 8), the set offers a lot of fun with the hideout, 4 figs, and accessories. KEY POINT: This set makes a great boat shed and I didn't even bother puting in the spider man fusion thing. Lego doesn't need the link to the movie to make this a nice set. Nix the spiderman and accessories, lower the price and you've got a great set without the hipe.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-22T11:00:34Z","Decent set","Bought this at Target the other day. It is a good set. Doc Ock's arms are cool. I didn't like the skin tones though, but two of the torso pieces are usable (Harry and Peter). There isn't much floorspace inside the warehouse because of that funky machine, but none the less a good set. Also note:new grays and new brown, but they're not that bad, people.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-10T17:00:00Z","One Set to Rule Them All...","Here is one building I don't care not having all the sides for!  I got this set at Wal-Mart after a mistake marked it down to $20!  I would not pay fifty for it but for the price I paid, I can't say that any of the Spider-Man sets are better.  Overall, I think the set works great as a hideout or as a boat shed as an earlier review said.  Very recommended if you can find it on sale.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-28T15:05:21Z","Brilliant!","I got this yesterday (27 Dec 04)in the January Sales for &#163;20.00 GBP and I must say this is a great set. I love the mini-figs, the new grey and flesh-tone figs don't bother me, though they don't go with many other of my sets, it's all good. There were only 2 problems with this set: The space inside is mostly taken up by the fusion machine, because one of the bar things take up one part of it and it's the old rival again: STICKERS! How many times do we have to see them? They are SO annoying, it looks like LEGO will never get rid of them and just put them on the sets themselves! I like the figures but there is only one Mary Jane out of thw whole of the Spider-Man 2 series which is a let down and I like her new look, with the darker hair and new face, but the clothes don't really match what she wore in the film but I guess that's what makes it better. But I do like the fact of putting Harry Osborne in the set, though he isn't in that particular scene himself, but you could use him as Mary Jane's fiancee like I do. But over-all a good set with useful pieces and a good set of figs. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-06T14:43:49Z","good! but could use some changes...","i love the blue baseplate (dont see to many of those anymore), and the way the roof is made is awesome! but its not to much like the movie's like the front side isnt tilted and falling apart,the wharehouse isnt big enough, and the fusion machine? oh i'l tell you people who &quot;think it has to be like the movie&quot; about the fusion machine! the color's wrong and dock ock (standing on tentacles) is taller than it! 

anyway,if you dont like it,the set includes more then half the pieces you need to build a better one (yay!)  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-01-07T15:47:34.42Z","one of my favourites!","this was one of my first sets in the new colours - at first i tried to avoid sets with flesh-coloured minifigs and the new gray, but this set looked so fantastic i could not resist (meanwhile i got used to the new gray anyway).
best of all i like the building, it looks really stylish &amp; rotten with those big windows and in the grey-brown combination. the minifigs are neat, i don't mind wether harry was in that scene or not. also this was the last set to come with a blue baseplate - its a shame it is out of stock now, with all those boats (creator-sets) coming in 2008!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradosis","2009-06-16T01:55:02.543Z","Nice Building, But A Bit Lackluster Otherwise","This set is hit and miss, with some good features on the one hand, and a lot of problems on the other. First, the good. The set overall has a very appealing color scheme of light grey, dark grey and brown, though the accents of yellow and blue do detract from the set. The set is built on a blue 10"" x 10"" baseplate, which is always nice to have another one of. The building itself is very nicely built and colored, though for some reason there are yellow colored bricks in the building messing up the flow and color scheme. And for the final good point, there are lots of 2x2 round brown bricks to be had with this set.

And then there are the problems. The miniboat is small and really lackluster. The Spider man launching device is also lackluster. There are holes in the dock. There's no door on the building for some reason, just an open doorway. The five minifigs are underwhelming. I'm not a fan of the contraption in the building, which  took a lot of parts to build. And there aren't really many details considering the size of this set. The front windows open up by splitting apart, the roof attaches using various technic parts, but there's not much else.

I'm not a huge fan of this set, though I'm also not a fan of the Spider Man theme in general, so I'm a bit biased. I guess if you're a fan of the theme you might find this set more appealing than I did. As it stands, though, the main reason I'd recommend this set would be if you want a good amount of brown parts, or can find the set used on ebay for a low price like I did. I'd give the set a 74/100.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"keithyw","2008-12-11T00:07:29.247Z","Great For Anything But the Movie","Again, like the other Spider-Man sets, I bought this set for the future potential of using it as spare pieces.  Of course, it represents a shady warehouse where Doc Ock hangs out in concocting his machinations to re-do his energy experiment.  However, if you look at the exterior of this set, it kinda has the potential to act as a church.

Since there aren't many unique buildings in the Lego town world these days, I thought it would be quite useful as a church or dock warehouse with some renovation.  No real need for collapsing pieces, so I would just revise those sections to be sturdier.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
