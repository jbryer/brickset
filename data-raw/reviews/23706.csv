<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>your normal polybag, i like the battle image on the end of the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>a new minifig, so some new parts there, the chain saw blades that are pretty rare. the sloping part at the front is also rare</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>a sabre-tooth named sykor. he is exclusive to this set, but will soon&nbsp;also be&nbsp;in 2015 set, as well as rumered to be in a summer 2014 set we still do not have an image for. i like his detailing, with a broken fang, and cool looking chains this is both cool and is accurate to his tv apperince.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>nice and easy, as well as fun. got it done in 2 min</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>love the use of the chainsaws, the bulk is focused on the front, so the back or side do not look TOO good, but it is a poly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>okay but 1 or&nbsp;2 improvments would be nice</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A cheap alternative to larger sets with Sykor in it. If you&rsquo;re only interested in the minifigure.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Sykor print is impressive, the leg printing, double-sided torso, double-sided face and unique head gear printing is all very detailed and shows off the ravages that the ice tribe have gone through being frozen for so long. Chima Minifigures are some of the best that LEGO has introduced.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model is a fast easy build which leads to fast fun times with this set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Transparent blue skies and bladed ice bits included in the set.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sykor has no weapon accessories.</li>
	<li>The model uses an ordinary steering wheel for control, it stands out a bit as out of place on such a tiny model especially as the vehicle would probably not have an actual engine as typically they&rsquo;re controlled by Chi.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say this is a decent sort of polybag, nothing too difficult or disappointing here outside of the fact that Sykor only has a Chi crystal for an accessory. Sykor&rsquo;s a pretty decent looking Minifigure from the Saber-tooth tiger tribe and this is the cheapest method of obtaining him if you&rsquo;re only looking to collect the minifigure. Mildly recommended though it&rsquo;s safe to skip.</p>
