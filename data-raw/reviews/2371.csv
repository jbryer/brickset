"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-16T13:48:24Z","Its alright","The only thing good about the Spiderman line of sets is that they are essentially town sets in disguise. The ambulance rules and saves me from having to buy an after market one at a jacked up price. There are a lot of pieces in here that I haven't seen for some time (actual car doors, the light blue wind screen and the doors and windows). Don't care too much about the Doc or the new darker blue version of spiderman. Hopefully Lego keeps on this trail of town themed sets, just add more to the buildings and loose the Marvel spin.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

the wall piece with the stickered window is also a nice idea to complete a full building.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-09-30T20:00:34.747Z","Why Isn't Lego Sticking with 4- Wide Cars?","This set I think is the last time I saw Lego make a 4 wide vehicle. Lego did well on the ambulance which I praise for doing so. Lego needs to go back to the 4 wide vehicles and the ambulance is a good example of that.
      Besides that, the building seems to be a little weak. The front looks nice, but where are the walls? It doesn't seem right. The minifigs are nice also with Spidey and Doc Ock. 
    Overall, this isn't bad, but I give it a 4 out of 5.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"xboxtravis7992","2016-03-22T21:52:26.723Z","A Super Hero Set from my Childhood","<p>With the large wave of Marvel Superhero sets we are now getting tying into Disney&#39;s MCU films and cartoons, it seems a lot of Lego fans have forgotten about the earlier Marvel sets. The Spider-Man 2 sets were based off the hit film; a movie which is considered by many to have been what started the current Hollywood &quot;Superhero Movie&quot; craze. Unfortunately this set came out at a time Lego was struggling financially, and sets tended to be simple and &quot;juniorized.&quot;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing spectacular about any of the parts here; the colors are common and are widely available in many sets. The pieces used for Doc Ock&#39;s claws were new at the time, but are now in wide distribution.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is were the set really shines (a omen for future sets perhaps?)</p>

<p><strong>Spider-Man;&nbsp;</strong>this probably is still one of the best Spider-Man figures Lego has made to date. From the dark red and blue colors in the plastic, to the metallic printing; it is an accurate depiction of the suit worn by Toby McGuirre in the original film trilogy. The figure&#39;s detailing could also represent the suit worn by Andrew Garfield in the short lived reboot series.&nbsp;Spidey comes with a white rope to represent his webs.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Otto Octavius;&nbsp;</strong>the main villain of the film was both dangerous and sympathetic. The figure here represents the costume Alfred Molina wore during Otto&#39;s initial fusion energy experiment. The robotic tentacles were a new&nbsp;design for Lego, and have been used with very little changes for future versions of Dr. Octopus.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Harry Osborn;</strong>&nbsp;while rather bland in comparison to the other figures; Osborn&#39;s minifigure is far more versatile. I have disassembled him and rebuilt him dozens of times; his suit having been worn by my Tony Stark figures and his face and hair showing up in different builds.</p>

<p><strong>Paramedic;</strong>&nbsp;One of Lego&#39;s earliest figures to represent racial diversity. If my memory serves me correct, the only other figures with varied skin tone that Lego made at the time were those for Lando in Star Wars, and the short lived NBA collectible figure line. This figure is spectacular, and well represents the world of New York City.</p>

<p>It should be noted though that there is one figure notably absent from the lineup, Otto&#39;s wife Rosie. Seeing that her death was a big factor in his turn to evil in the film, it is upsetting that Lego chose not to include her in this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>So yeah this was 2004; meaning Lego was building very &quot;juniorized&quot; sets. So this build is very bland. Very bland. At least there is some Technic building in the middle, but not really anything of note.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>So yeah, the final model didn&#39;t offer much. The fusion generator set up was just strange, with blue and yellow &quot;battle droid&quot; parts being used to represent the reactor arms instead of a more realistic gray color. The trans purplish/blue disc pieces used to represent the fusion reaction are a strange thing to, especially seeing that the film hyped the fact &quot;fusion power is the power of the sun&quot; and the reaction in the film was a orangish colored sun. The building&#39;s facade is also rather simple and small. The ambulance is basic to, although the printed slope on the hood is nice, the build feels dated. The use of large stickers for the side distracts from the model.</p>

<p>Play feature wise there is a mechanism that causes Doc Ock to be launched in the air by pushing the fusion reaction down, but that is about it. An alternative model is offered at the end of the instruction booklet that suggests placing the fusion reactor on the back of a pick-up ambulance...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a strange set. I love the figures, but the model itself suffered. The parts are currently scattered in my spare parts bin, and I don&#39;t know if I will ever rebuild the model. Still, there is a lot of nostalgia to this thing that makes me appreciate the set. And all the minifigures included here are A+ grade; and have enough details they can be used with the newer Marvel Superhero sets.&nbsp;</p>

"RJSS","2017-04-17T20:04:08.237Z","Let's call it... interesting...","<p><em><strong>The Minifigures</strong></em></p>

<p>The minifigs included&nbsp;are undoubtedly the highlight of this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Spider-Man, in his Spider-Man 2 movie costume, looks wonderful with plenty of silver lines on his suit. The figure comes with great back printing for the head and torso, which is quite surprising in minifigures dating back from the mid 2000s. The muscular details are achieved through subtle color changes on the suit, instead of the obnoxious, cartoony&nbsp;black lines we&#39;ve gotten in newer iterations of comic-based characters from the Superheroes theme. There&#39;s plenty of details to look at in this figure! As per usual, Spidey includes a white vine piece to work as his web for some fun swinging action.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Harry Osborne comes with a dark gray suit, with a few vertical white lines printed on for detailing. Sadly, the lack of leg printing does hurt the look of this minifigure. Interestingly, LEGO decided to recycle the 2002 Studios Actor&#39;s face for Harry, as this had previously been used as Norman Osorn/Green Goblin&#39;s face, although this time it is printed on a flesh headpiece, instead of a yellow one. The minifig&#39;s hairpiece was, in fact, also borrowed from Norman&#39;s previous minifigure outings in the Studios/Spider-Man&nbsp;theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Ambulance Driver, despite being a generic City mnifigure, includes some great details as well. The figure&#39;s blue jacket is printed with a zipper and a Star of Life badge, and includes white gloves. The most notable thing about this figure, though, may be the skin tone, as it is what we the community like to call Metru Brown. Reddish Brown is the color used for the great majority of&nbsp;dark-skinned minifigures, so this makes up for an incredibly useful and exclusive headpiece. A nice bonus comes in the shape of a white briefcase piece, here used as a first aid kit.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Doc Ock (or Otto Octavius, as he should be called in this set&#39;s context) is perhaps the main draw, given he is exclusive and very hard to find nowadays. He&#39;s in his light gray lab jumpsuit, though we get some superb silver details across his waist to simulate the harnesses that attach him to his cybernetic tentacles. The headpiece has exclusive printing, depicting lab goggles with green lenses. The tentacles themselves, although very impressive looking, are somewhat tricky to pose and extremely space-consuming for a minifig, not to mention, also not exclusive to this set, but still pretty nice to get and obligatory for Octavius&#39;s character.</p>

<p><b><i>The Build</i></b></p>

<p>The two builds included here are a small 4-wide ambulance, and a build for the Fusion Lab.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The ambulance, as other reviewers have pointed out, is fairly reminiscent of the older Town and System sets from the 90s, as most of the vehicles in such sets&nbsp;also made use of the 4-wide style. Up front is a nice printed 3x4 slope; this is unusual as printed slopes are usually the small 2x2 type. The sides are presented with some nice details, although sadly STAMPs&nbsp;(stickers across multiple parts) are used, thus making that part of the model&nbsp;undissassembleable&nbsp;(?) after applying the stickers. A stretcher for an unconscious Doc Ock is also included.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Fusion Lab&nbsp;can, perhaps, be divided in two parts: the facade&nbsp;and the interior, both build on large 6x14&nbsp;plates joined by hinge bricks.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The former section of the building, as its name suggests, consists of a large red wall to cover up the interior. It is detailed with profile bricks, and uses older-style pieces for the door and windows, which are delightful to get in a more modern set. There is also a stickered&nbsp;glass pane piece, with an&nbsp;&#39;&#39;Otto Octavius Enterprise&#39;&#39; logo on it. It is rather inaccurate, as Otto&#39;s project is actually funded by Oscorp in the film; it would have also been wonderful to get an Oscorp&nbsp;decorated piece too, but sadly we don&#39;t.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The interior is build on a higher level, making it look rather wonky when placed next to the facade section. It includes a small brick-built rendition of Otto&#39;s Fusion Reactor. The reactor is a very small build, but remains quite screen-accurate. There is also a small spot for the operator (in this case, Doc Ock) to stand on, nicely decorated with a small computer keyboard.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Play Features</em></strong></p>

<p>The set includes a small but rather ingenious play feature, which makes the &#39;&#39;Operator&#39;s Spot&#39;&#39; bust open when the &#39;&#39;Sun&#39;&#39; orb on the reactor is pressed down. It is&nbsp;simple in concept but putting it together is such a fun experience thanks to the clever way in which it is designed, which is, basically, a contraption made from gears and tiles. It&#39;s great to see such&nbsp;builds and techniques in a small, $20&nbsp;set.</p>

<p><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></p>

<p>Overall, the value within this set is stunning. There are&nbsp;4 minifigures (3 of which are exclusive, and 2 of which are quite desirable), plus two builds with a good parts selection. The issue, though, is that the builds are rather weak, being horribly scaled (the ambulance is almost as tall as the Fusion Lab&#39;s facade), and rather simplistic. Being realistic, though, having to stick a vehicle and a building into a small $20&nbsp;set very much restricts what you can actually do, anyways. The original $20 RRP presents some wonderful value, but the current average asking price for a used, complete copy of this set is about $50, which might not seem a very good deal. However, the minifigures included are mostly cheap and can be easily bought online separately.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Final rating: 8.5/10</em></p>
