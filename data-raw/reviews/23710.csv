<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice box. Gave me a very good idea of what was inside.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Kind of just one basically, unless you want to count the links in the chain.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Errrm. One!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Over too soon if I&#39;m honest. It comes ready assembled.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks like R2D2! What more could you ask for?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was given this as a Christmas present. Oh joy I didn&#39;t think. It&#39;s about 1/3 scale bigger than the regular R2&nbsp;figure so no play value, unless you want to destroy the Empire with a Gamma infused droid. However, wait until you have a power cut, and your kids have worn out the batteries on your torch playing murder in the dark, and this comes into it&#39;s element. The light is really strong. I&#39;ve had this for six months. Probably use it for a few minutes every other day and the battery is still going strong. Use it to check on our resident hedgehog at night. Get stuff from the car in the evening. The back door key is attached to it. The kids leave it alone because it&#39;s Daddys. I&#39;d honestly be lost without it. And it&#39;s totally charming. Great product!</p>
