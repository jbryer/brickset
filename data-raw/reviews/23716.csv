"Mr__Thrawn","2020-12-31T03:07:35.203Z","Easily the Best of the LEGO Films","<p><em>The LEGO Movie,&nbsp;</em>the 2014 animated film directed by acclaimed duo Phil Lord and Chris Miller, was a surprise critical and box-office hit. Its universal themes and humor, coupled with the massive roster of celebrity voice actors, proved a winning formula. The dedication to craft is impressive: every sequence, barring the live-action ones, is animated using entirely existing LEGO bricks. The cast is great too: Chris Pratt, Elizabeth Banks, Community&#39;s Alison Brie, Charlie Day,&nbsp;Will Arnett, Nick Offerman of Parks and Recreation, Will Ferrell, and even Morgan Freeman appear in major roles. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill have cameos as well, a nod to Lord/Miller&#39;s 21 Jump Street. The score by Mark Mothersbaugh is fitting and catchy, and who can forget &quot;Everything is Awesome&quot; (no one can. We want to but we can&#39;t.) The movie is a lot of fun to watch again and again; definitely worth owning.</p>

<p>The Blu-Ray and DVD transfers look good, and the special features are mostly fine. I quite like the commentary track, though. It&#39;s quite comprehensive and features the directors and starring cast (minus Morgan Freeman).&nbsp;The animated shorts are okay, nothing too special, except for the truly excellent Michelangelo and Lincoln: History Cops.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Blu-Ray can be obtained for a few dollars at various retailers, and, as previously stated, I think it&#39;s a must-have for any LEGO fan.</p>
