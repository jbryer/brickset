I won&rsquo;t be reviewing the movie itself, or any of what is actually there, since there are many more competent reviewers online that can do that.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>This version of the LEGO Movie is in a large plastic case that is sealed and includes the unique mini-figure, the blue-ray and dvd case and a special looking 3D Emmet Photo. It really is an interesting combination and I think it does a suitable job of attracting the eye on the shelf. The inclusion of a physical representation of Emmet in 3D is a nice addition for younger viewers, they can put it anywhere they want in their room and enjoy it whenever they play. A shame it doesn&rsquo;t include any actual studs for attaching to a brick built picture frame.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Vitruvius: This minifig represents the character as seen in the prologue of the film. It uses the same basic parts from Vitruvius in the actual sets, the cape and hair piece, but features new torso printing, a different coloured hairband (silver) and his signature facial print before he was blinded by Lord Business. It&rsquo;s a great figure to include with the movie, unfortunately his mystical staff from that same scene is not included, ordinarily we don&rsquo;t see accessories, however for a film character such as this it would have been nice for them to include it.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>The film included in this set is a combination package. You get the film on DVD, regular Blu-Ray and 3D Blu-Ray. For that price it is very impressive, the special features on the DVD are limited, as is usual. The special features on the blu-ray include many fun and interesting behind the scenes featurettes, a sing-along for Everything is Awesome with some fun visuals, interesting build-your-own tutorials for emmett&rsquo;s car and double-decker couch by actual LEGO Model designers and an audio commentary by cast and crew that is as equally entertaining as the film itself. It will hold your attention for over two hours.</p>

<p>I especially enjoyed the building tutorials as they show different custom models from the designer that can be built in-place of the actual models seen in the film. All presented in a fun and easy to follow manner.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of LEGO, and who isn&rsquo;t? You will love the LEGO Movie, and the extra contents included in this set add many fun extras that everyone can enjoy. The bonus Minifigure is a great choice, though including an accessory for him would have been greatly appreciated. With a sequel already guaranteed I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing what will happen next time. I recommend this version over the others if you truly want to have everything in a neat little package.</p>
