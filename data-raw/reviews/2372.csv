"cys07gz","2009-04-04T07:52:20.56Z","A rather silly set","Yes, I am 48 and should not have been buying a 4-Junior set, but even 4-Junior, here are the issues that i think the set is silly about.

1.  The ramp. Don't think anybody, junior or otherwise, will, or can, utilize the ramp for ""jumping"" by any vehicles, particularly the two ""motorcycles"" in the set with less than stable mechanisms.

2A.  The two ""motorcycles"". They cannot stand on thier own, and there is no place where you can build on to help them stand except some ""heavy duty"" (for a junior set) Technic pieces.

2B.  The two ""motorcycles"". They do not have a handle bar. Even there is no sterring mechanism, it is unthinkable that a motorcycle could have no handle bar. For the two motorcycles in the set, this results in the minifigs having to keep leaning forward, but without anything to hold on to, to get a better fit.

3A.  The helicopter.  Don't think giving Spidey a seat will cost Lego, or the buyers, too much.  I pity Spidey's bottoms.

3B.  The helicopter.  This is not the only set, junior or otherwise, that Lego puts a ""lift all the way and in the roter's way"" canopy to a helicopter.

The only good thing is that I got a set with one helicopter, two motorcycles and three minifigs for only HK$100, which is about US$12.8, from Yahoo HK.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
