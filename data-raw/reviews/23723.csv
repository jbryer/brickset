Instead, you drag and drop the bricks inside the app. Then the AR part launches where it snaps pictures of your real car. However, all it does is to verify that your real car corresponds to the one you already built in the editor. If it matches, then you enter the racing game. So there is absolutely nothing gained from the scanning sequence- it&#39;s just a little something they tossed between the design &amp; race phase. Very disappointed.</span></p>

<p>There are various Creator sets that have similar parts at a much lower price.</p>
