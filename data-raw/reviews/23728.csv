"Odeinoichus","2016-08-01T23:13:48.9Z","Impressive Small Scale Set.","<p><strong>Set #40109 Mini-Cooper: </strong>LEGO is a real fan of making miniature versions of some of their large scale vehicle builds like the Volkswagen Camper Van and this year&rsquo;s impressive Mini-Cooper. This one was given free on LEGO S&amp;H with qualifying purchases. Is it worth owning? Read on and find out.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Lovely use of pieces to replicate larger build. Nice rare dark green parts included.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Instructions easy to follow and use.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Finished model is awesome, seriously this thing is so much fun and has such wonderful detail for something at this scale. It&rsquo;s so much fun to look at and play with and makes a great desk toy display. The lovely dark green colours used really make it pop and stand out.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Roof has some issues, 1 x 2 tile used to make the roof completely smooth sticks out and ruins the overall curved design and look of the model.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Doesn&rsquo;t include micro-scaled picnic basket. Minor complaint, but it would have been an interesting build to see included if possible.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall you can&rsquo;t go wrong tracking this one down. You can add more rare dark green pieces to your parts list and the model&rsquo;s not bad either. Strongly recommended and a really fun build.</p>
