The minifigures aren't nice too. the cars are almost the same and the café is almost empty. no, I don't like this set! I saw that on the internet people give €20 for this set! that's way to much!</p>

<p>Don't buy it!</p>",TRUE,3,1,2,4,3

Doc Ock and Spidey look more realistic than their regular minifigure counterparts. On the other hand, the set has interactive characteristics that surely should allow for any kid to be entertained. As a collectible, it is also valuable, but mainly for the figures, in my opinion. Overall this is a good set that all Spider-Man fans can enjoy.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
