<p>This was the title of the e-mail newsletter I received from the Lego VIP program on the first of July 2014, stating: &quot;Relive the golden age of LEGO Space, with this FREE VIP-EXCLUSIVE Classic Spaceman Minifigure when you spend 30 &euro; or more.* Only until 7th July! &quot;</p>

<p>So I did! I am reliving it now as I just received my order from Legoshop@home, and among the sets I ordered TLG was kind enough to include this nifty little vintage retro Lego astronaut, accompanied by a small brick build robot.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This tiny set actually comes in a box! That is right; a box, not some polybag but a sturdy&nbsp; white cardboard box with a matt finish (opposed to the glossy finish of most other boxes Lego sets are packaged in).</p>

<p>The dimensions of the box are: 15,3 by 10,2 by 3,1 cm. In the upper left corner on the front of the box is the familiar Lego logo in a red square. Underneath the logo is some text printed stating: ages 6+ ; piece count 19 pcs ; and &quot;building toy&quot; in six different languages. Centre right on the front is a retro style picture with the contents of the box: the robot on the left and the white astronaut on the right posing against a black night sky with stars, placed on yellow lunar sand dunes, which is very reminiscent of the box art and front covers of instruction manuals of &#39;classic space&#39; Lego sets from the late 1970s and early 1980s as I remember them from my early childhood. There is also a small picture of the opened booklet included in the set, printed on the front of the box, placed in the centre at the bottom covering left bottom corner of the photo depicting the Minifigs. The lower right corner of the front has an extra logo with a yellow 2 by 2 brick with a banner across it with &#39;2014&#39; written on it.</p>

<p>When you cut the transparent round seal you can remove the top cover which slides over the inner cardboard box folded like a tray with double walls. The bottom of the tray reveals a big classic Lego space logo. Furthermore the artwork of both the outer sleeve as well as the inner tray of the box feature a Lego stud design print.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>According to the piece account written on the box there should be 19 pieces inside the box. I counted only 18 pieces inside the plastic bag.</p>

<p>the retro astronaut is comprised of five pieces.</p>

<p>The brick build robot is made out of 13 elements.</p>

<p>This little robot has made its appearance twice before, both times in 1985. Once identical as it appears in this set, namely in set: #6931&nbsp; FX Star Patroller. And once in different colours (blue and grey), and with a 2x2 plate attached to its underside in set:&nbsp; #6952&nbsp; Solar Power Transport. However, without the short black light-sabre/rod element hidden inside its torso, as that element did not exist at the time.</p>

<p>There are no extra spare parts inside the bag, which in regular Lego sets are usually scattered in tiny amounts throughout all the numbered bags included.</p>

<p>I can only assume that the nineteenth piece in this set is the booklet?!</p>

<p>Apart from the helmet which is a newer type, this Minifig is, as far as I can tell, exactly the same as the original space Minifigure. The &#39;original Minifig helmet&#39; worn by classic spacemen, as well as other Minifigs from the eighties and late seventies such as the classic knights, and classic town Minifigs had a thinner chin/jaw strap, more prone to cracking and breaking. The &#39;old&#39; helmet looked different, it follows the curvature of a Minifig head more closely in outward appearance, as opposed to this helmet, which bears more resemble to a motor helmet. Personally I favour the look of this helmet over the old one, and may one day update all my other classic spacemen with this model helmet too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There really is not that much to say about the build since there are only 18 Lego elements in this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A Minifig and a brickfig.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set a lot, I would not have placed an order at this time if it had not been for this for &#39;VIPs only&#39; set which I felt compelled to get.</p>

<p>If you cannot get hold of this set, the parts itself are easily bricklinked, or maybe you already have all the elements in your own collection?! The big draw for me was nostalgia. A new and prestine Minifig which is fun to have and display. Plus the way the set was presented with the box and booklet.</p>

<p>About the booklet: from front to back there are 16 pages. The first two pages (after the cover), are the instruction manual for both figures. The rest of the booklet contains numerous pictures of old sets and Minifigs from 1976 untill 2013. Well Actually 2014 if you count this little set along. The booklet has a sewn binding instead of staples, which is a nice detail, yet the resolution of many pictures inside unfortunately is very low, and that is quite a disappointment.</p>

<p>First thing I did when I built the figures was rummage through my spare parts looking for a visor to attach to his helmet, while I was at it I also went looking for a head with a &#39;modern&#39; facial expression of my liking, since I personally prefer the tremendous variety of face prints of today over the &#39;antique&#39; smiley faces. Some people won&#39;t like that, but hey! That is just me. I also decided to give him some binoculars and a double barrel raygun to hold in his hands, since the minifig does not come with any props. Then it was time to display him and his robot alongside some other space Minifigs from my collection.</p>

<p>If you like this set, and you live in a country in Europe, you still have today and tomorrow to place an order, make sure to get a VIP account if you haven&#39;t got one, to be eligible to get one! To all fans of Lego elsewhere, I hope that TLG will make the set available too for anyone outside Europe. This is a great little set to add to your collection!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is quite nice, and better than a polybag. A tray slides out from one side of the box.&nbsp;This contains the instructions and a single bag of parts.</p>

<p>The first 2 pages of the instructions show how to assemble the spaceman and robot. There is a 3 stud long bar running through the robot&#39;s body. This helps keep the arms from falling off, and is a useful part. The rest of the booklet has an abbreviated&nbsp;history of Lego Space, running from 1978 to 2013.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Personally, I find the 1x1 SNOT brick w/ four studs quite useful. There is, as I said, a three stud long black bar, which has appeared in 43 different sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The spaceman is great, especially&nbsp;if you have&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21109-1/Exo-Suit"">http://brickset.com/sets/21109-1/Exo-Suit</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not much to say here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The robot is cute, and fits right in with any classic space MOC</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great Minifig and Robot, but not worth spending extra money so you can&nbsp;reach $99.99 to get it.</p>
