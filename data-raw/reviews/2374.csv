So that night, I found out lego was a great toy. As my first set, I recomend this set to people ages 4 to 100. This is a great set indeed, a very good set.

"Freezdried","2010-01-28T12:11:47.56Z","Classic, awkward spaceship","I give this set high marks simply because of its nostalgic value.  I just built this the other day, and was impressed by what Lego designers were able to do with such a limited amount of brick types.  I remember that I always liked getting space sets because they seemed like they were on the 'cutting edge' of brick design.  All the cool new bricks made their debut appearance in the space sets.

One thing I loved about this set as a kid were those clear bricks that didn't have the inner supports.  Before this time, transparent bricks had inner supports, so they weren't really clear.  Finally, Lego designed bricks that were truly transparent.  It seems like such a given, these days, but back when this set came out it was quite an innovation!

When compared to later spaceships, this one looks a little boxy. But still, given the time, this was a great toy!  I mean, just think: this came out in 1978!  Pretty cool for a toy from the '70's!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"gelkster","2011-02-11T21:50:16.51Z","My first (& best) Space set","<p>I recall getting this one Christmas,&nbsp;I think I was 7, &amp; to date it's my favorite Lego set of all- so much so that I can assemble it from memory. Though my collection was small then, this set introduced several unique pieces- the trans yellow cockpit hatch, the gray forklift piece (rare to this day), the front blue slope w/ Space insignia, the ""LL924"" bricks. It was the perfect set for those who couldnt afford the Galaxy Explorer! I recently rebuilt it, &amp; used alternate pieces in place of those that were gone. I began using Bricklink to get most of these pieces back so I could restore my Space Cruiser to its original glory. While&nbsp;a few&nbsp;pieces still elude me, the ship looks great &amp; I have it built to this day!&nbsp;I love the cockpit hatch, swingout cargo doors, &amp; gray buggy/forklift. The white driver needed a radio though.&nbsp;What did YOU use the green cylinder for?</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5

<p>This set is&nbsp;flawless. It is compact with a perfect selection of figures and parts. The price fits the set perfectly and feels as if it is just one of an entire fleet. Its parts are revolutionary with the plates that form the wings being able to make more accurate planes and the many blue parts to make buildings standout in a city or display. The most valuable part is actually the translucent yellow window on the roof of the ship which is great for skylights and custom creations. overall a 9/10 not my favourite set but definitely worth the price.</p>

<p>(much of the review stays the same however with it&#39;s inflated price in the modern day the set is great however if you can find an open copy under $50 I think it is worth the money.)</p>
