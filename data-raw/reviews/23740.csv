Similar to past Character Encyclopedias this title is more for younger readers. That being said, AFOL parents may enjoy reading this to their children and sharing in the fun.</p>

<p>Presentation</p>

<p>This book is a lot more colourful than the plain white covered encyclopedias from other LEGO Themes. There is still a white background on the front cover, but it is surrounded by the classic purple tones of the LEGO Friends Theme. 176 Pages make up the bulk of this book, many of them individual pages for the Friends, their homes and places of business and just about everything else from the Theme since 2012. Having been printed in 2014 not all sets are represented, which is to be expected from an ongoing Theme, however the back does include a complete visual listing of all sets up to the point of publication, including the Polybags, with a few strangely absent exceptions.</p>

<p>There are also pages dedicated to all the animals and most accessories, however we&rsquo;ll cover more of that in the actual contents. The presentation is very well thought out, the cover grabs your attention, the pages showcase the sets and characters quite nicely and it is the type of quality one expects from DK Publishing and LEGO.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Naya: As Minidolls go Naya isn&rsquo;t much to discuss mostly because there are very few printed pieces for these dolls. The torso has a nice flower print white sleeveless shirt and is wearing a rich purple skirt with purple and dark pink sandals. Her hair is blonde and she has light brown eyes. What makes Naya unique compared to most other Minifigures or Minidolls found in DK Publishing books outside of the Brickmaster line is that she includes actual accessories.</p>

<p>Yep, Naya comes with a light purple shopping bag/basket and a printed tile with an Iphone print. This is a welcome addition for something from the Friends Theme, as it gives the minidoll more to play with. It&rsquo;s such a shame that, possibly due to costs, DK doesn&rsquo;t include unique accessories with any of their other novels. Even Harry Potter didn&rsquo;t get a wand when he was included with the DK LEGO Harry Potter books.</p>

<p>Contents</p>

<p>You would be amazed at how much can actually be featured in a book based on a Theme with mostly five characters. Not only are there pages dedicated to all the mini-dolls introduced, with fun facts and little asides that flesh out their character and backstory, but you also have pages and whole sections dedicated to the animals, the places of Heartlake City and the vehicles that the Friends drive, fly or float around in.</p>

<p>The back has dedicated pages to the mini-dolls in a fun gallery, the sets and the animals and accessories in large visual checklist style pages. Though there are no checkboxes to tick. And while most adult fans might not be the target audience of this type of endeavor it still offers much to appreciate. It&rsquo;s also nice to see that all the animals are given names and personalities, so that the younger fans have something to base their stories around when playing with the sets, though I&rsquo;m sure LEGO&rsquo;s online site might have mentioned those before now.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Recommended, like all DK Publishing material this is a decent enough addition to the library of the fans of this Theme in the desired age range. With another year now passed and more Friends on the way next year I can safely say that we&rsquo;ll probably be seeing an updated and expanded edition in 2017, more than likely. However this book is still worth tracking down, as there is quite a bit to see and enjoy.</p>
