<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging feels a little wasteful for such a small set, but it was a treat to open and a reminder of Lego&#39;s high standards. &nbsp;It keeps the tent cover safe, too, which in my mind completely justifies it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The main attraction in this set is the fabric tent cover. &nbsp;It is very high quality, which redeems&nbsp;the long wait since the last set with a&nbsp;fabric tent. &nbsp;Older tents had to have pieces hold the flaps closed, which was unattractive and a nuisance... this tent is cut so that the flaps overlap, and hold each other closed, which is a wonderful feature.&nbsp; The tools, crates, fish, popsicles, and blue heads - which are cleverly used as propane tanks - are great additions too, and the tent base is constructed with some of the newer clip pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;add a great deal of play to the set, and use the same faces and clothes that feature prominently in the other city arctic sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very simple, and isn&#39;t the focus of the set. &nbsp;It&#39;s fun to assemble the accessories and to see how quickly everything comes together, but be aware that the set is essentially all accessories.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While this set is very simple, it&#39;s also very unique. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t stand well on its own, but it makes for great fun when paired with other arctic creations. &nbsp;The&nbsp;tent and a snowmobile would make for a great scouting expedition, but it&nbsp;could just as easily be an outpost, outbuilding, or supply storage area for a base camp (and it even comes with the supplies!).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is an excellent bonus pack, and I was very excited to be able to pick up a copy of such a special offering. &nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Any number of this set would&nbsp;make a great addition to&nbsp;any</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;adventure, arctic or otherwise... so long as you&#39;re not trying to blend in, that is, given the color! &nbsp;Very highly recommended indeed!</span></p>
