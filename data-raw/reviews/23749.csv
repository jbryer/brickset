<p>The box is striking its done with the super shiny cardboard that is seen in all the SDCC&nbsp;sets and some regular sets. It has 2 seal tags one which is long and narrow with the number #/1000 (mine is 673)&nbsp;and a round clear one which are located at both ends of the box.&nbsp;The instructions aren&#39;t particular special, normal quality (good) and it does its job (better).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of cool pieces but the ones that stand out is silver non-printed droid&nbsp;head as missiles, silver 1x1 smooth stud as the end of the missiles. The orange slope pieces found at the front and back of the cock pit</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Only includes&nbsp;1 minifigure.&nbsp;rocket raccoon which&nbsp;was original exclusive till it was released in a toyrus&nbsp;exclusive polybag. The detail is crazy on the minifigure including detailed arm print&nbsp;and side leg printing on short legs. On top of the unconventional printing the back and front torso detail is also very detailed. Definitely the most amazing part of this mf is the custom shaped head with amazing face priting and has built in shoulder guards and the rubber raccoon tail. The con is that this minifigures unlike the sdcc exclusives mf are made in china.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took me 30mins go slow. was fun small build to sum it up. These sdcc sets are always small but they usually have some very good building techniques this is no exception.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I display it on a shelf with the rest of the sdcc sets that I own like&nbsp;dagobah, throne of ultron and&nbsp;the box&#39;s aren&#39;t particular big so I put the boxes behind the set and with this set I put rocket raccoon in&nbsp;front of the ship as it looks better when he isn&#39;t riding it like pictured.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set can&#39;t be judged like a regular set because it isn&#39;t. Lego has designed this set to be a collectable&nbsp;as so the box is the highlight as a lot of these well sadly be sealed either for a long time or forever. It makes a good small display and and small enjoyable build for non-lego collectors, as a lot of these will be going to comic book fans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its designed differently to impress a different demographic other than kids like the normal sets and other than afols like direct to customer sets. It does a great job and these few sets have probably gotten new people in the lego hobby&nbsp;</p>

<p>When comparing this to other SDCC&nbsp;sets It isn&#39;t my favourite, I like it a lot but prefer the minifigure scaled sets like the superman comic #1, throne of ultron and 1966 tv show bat mobile.&nbsp;</p>
