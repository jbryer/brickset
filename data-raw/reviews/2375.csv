"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-01T00:20:21Z","I like this set","It seems to be the continuation of 4097...... I like the new weapons, it's better than 4097. The only thing is that the colour scheme is rather dull this time...... I prefer brighter colour. 
However, if u have 4097 as well, displaying all six of the robots is magnificent.
Play on.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-13T14:10:19Z","Awesome.","This set rocks. The weapons, the colors, and the fact that it is another robot designer set! It has more building possibilities that the Mini Robots set. I like the new colors of &quot;teeth&quot;, and the 1x1 cylinders, they make good gun barrels. I have to say it's original, and Lego can make really big machine guns.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

YEAH!","just like the minirobots and green xpod they all sport some good articulation, but i just liked the minirobots set better cuz they all had guns. the red one just has a trident and shield (not complaining!) and the blue  one is a bird-bot thingy, dunno what that does. customization helps a lot thoygh",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-02-21T16:52:34.45Z","Great Robots!","Okay, first off these robots rock! The weapons are great and so are the colors(except the tan. Dunno where it came in with red and blue.)which make the set up what it is. However when I bought it it was missing pieces- the other anneteanea and part of the machine gun. I was mad but it still is a great set and is better than the first. I would rate it a 5/5 if I got all the pieces",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My review will be done with one pro and con for each robot, as seen on the front box and instruction manual.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>-Red: The staff/pitchfork and the wings make this look exceptional.<br></li><li>-Blue: The wings make this model stand out from the others.<br></li><li>-Yellow-Tan: The gun makes this bot look like a real leader, and the color is pretty nice also.<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>-Red: Though they are great pieces for the shield, the angled cockpit pieces are a bit unfilled and weird-looking.<br></li><li>-Blue: The loss of a weapon is a bit disappointing, and makes this look like the weak bot.<br></li><li>-Yellow-Tan: The thing on his right arm is weird, a bit of a filler.<br></li></ul>
<p>This set is exceptionally good, something I would have easily paid 30 dollars for since the design on the robots is so great. I recommend this to all who love technology.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
