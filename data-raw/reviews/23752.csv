"Mr_K","2015-02-08T22:38:50.147Z","28 years in to collecting, and this is a favourite","<p>If you can manage to get past and forget about the crazy price, you are in for a treat.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Great box! Very eye-catching. The instructions come in 2 booklets. I still feel with most new sets that the instructions are over-simplified these days, but that&#39;s probably me just showing my age.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For me at least, there are a heap of great new parts. The gatling guns are really fun, and there are some great connector parts to clip the side doors onto the main hull. Yes, there are stickers and my wife was more disappointed about this than me. But I didn&#39;t really expect them to paint the details on. They stickers are top-notch like usual though, and easy to re-position when applying if required.</p>

<p>Really like the tan colouring, as usually Star Wars sets are all grey and black, with some red for good measure.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Firstly, no Chewbacca. As this is from Rebels, I&#39;m assuming he&#39;s not in the episode, though my wife was really disappointed. I have Chewbacca from another set so it&#39;s all good with me, and the Wookies you do get here are fantastically detailed. Really like the Kanan figure as well, and since this is my first Rebels set, he is new for me.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really fun actually. While the ship is symmetrical on the outside, the inside build is varied and fun. The way the instructions lead you through the creation, I found was really well done and ensured there was always a new fun part to build on the next page.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very &quot;swoosh-able&quot; ;)</p>

<p>While not huge, it is and looks solid and bulky for a fighter jet. It&#39;s quite impressive with the big gatling gun wings and the little touches, like how the back fin sits. All the guns that don&#39;t fire, look great with how they are built, and there is more play value here than what I thought, as there is a small gun platform that fits in the back. Kanan can fit on this with his lightsaber, inside the ship. The compartment for this doesn&#39;t allow the head-space for a Wookie to stand on it, but I like to have the Wookies piloting the ship (it is a Wookie ship after all).</p>

<p>All characters can fit in the ship at once, bar 1 Wookie.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I loved the look of this piece from the first announcement pics, and then died at the site of the price ($100 here in Australia). I would never have bought this set for myself due to the price per part count. My wife bought it for me since she knew I really wanted it, and I&#39;m really glad she did.</p>

<p>Beside the price, this is one of my all time favourite sets Lego has made. The design of the ship is great, and along with the colouring, it is a breath of fresh air in the Star Wars line (yes, I know there are trade federation tanks in this colour, but the brown sticker markings really make this one pop).</p>

<p>Great, sturdy model where nothing is going to come off too easily.</p>

<p>I should note that none of the figures can stand up in the central cargo area (where the big doors on each side fold down). This area is only for the cargo.</p>

<p>For me personally, this set ranks up with the 10188 Death Star and 9496 Skiff.</p>

<p>If you can, wait for a sale (but in Australia Star Wars Lego sets don&#39;t really ever go down by much). I would recommend adding this set to your Lego collection at some point though, perhaps even if you&#39;re not usually a Lego Star Wars collector.</p>

"jenks87","2015-02-10T00:08:07.31Z","Not really a gunship...","<p>The first thought would be a Wookie version of the LAAT gunship, but upon completion you will realise it does not even come close, this is really a &quot;gun-ship&quot;; a ship with guns.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is big with the same theme as other Star Wars Rebels sets</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of curved slopes which are used for the walls, sides and wings of the ship</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Wookies are great, although still limited as they cannot move their heads, but there are prints on them with makes it great.Kanan Jarrus comes as a very plain figure, other than having a dark-tan skin colour and a very rare hairpiece, this figure is just a normal printed figure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The design is typical of recent Star Wars model; there will be a central-frame like structure that seems to be designed to hold the entire model together (or most of it)&nbsp;in case you drop it. However having such a frame on such a small model means there isn&#39;t much space for anything else. The patterns are all stickers and are all on the exterior except for the pilot&#39;s controls.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The front cargo hold is really a cargo hold, it does not fit any figures. For the rear cargo hold maybe a single Wookie can fit in with the gun-sled thing.</p>

<p>The front pilot stands while the one at the back sits, the pilots also do not have proper pilot controls; the front pilot has a transparent 1 x 2 panel piece with a sticker on it, the pilot at the back (which i presume is the gunner) has a printed 1 x 2 tile piece, neither has levers or anything along that line.</p>

<p>The gunner&#39;s cockpit can&#39;t close fully either.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you are looking for a troop-transport gunship, stick with LAAT, this is more like an Apache than a Hind equivalent.&nbsp;</p>
