However, it is most definitely a worthwhile addition to any fan&#39;s collection. There&#39;s not a component out of place in this set, and everything comes together to evoke everything I love about the Batman franchise. The build was excellent-not too challenging but no five-minute effort either-and the finished product is a joy to behold.</p>
