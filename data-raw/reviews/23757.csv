<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same one as the 2013 and the other three 2014 giveaway (the plastic blister pack with a display bubble). The pieces come in a very small bag, as it only has 16 pieces. The cool thing is that because this minifigure is not pre-built like the others, the instructions come on the inside&nbsp;of the card when it is folded out. Then you have simple instructions to assemble your Cutesykitty&nbsp;(or Cheerykitty&nbsp;depending on what you like).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As this is only&nbsp;Unikitty, this only comes with 16 pieces. A usual unikitty comes with 14 pieces, but LEGO give you the pieces for a spare head which is nice. There are four exclusive pieces in this set (the two heads and the two eyebrow pieces). The rest of the pieces are available&nbsp;on the Unikitty in the Cloud Cuckoo Palace set which costs $30 down here in Australia ($20 U.S).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set only comes with Unikitty, but as this a Comic Con exclusive, it will not be available&nbsp;in any other set (That sucks for people who can&#39;t get it as there were only 1750 of these made). The Cutesykitty variant is so adorable, and after watching The LEGO Movie again (Great movie by the way) I realized that this variant is in quite a bit of the movie, especially in Cloud Cuckoo Land. The Cheerykitty variant is also really good, although Cutesykitty is my favourite. Both would be good in making a stop-motion.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is definitely&nbsp;a great minifigure for anyone&#39;s collection, although it may be expensive. I paid around $120 for mine, and I don&#39;t regret it at all. If I were you, I would get it only if you really wanted a complete Unikitty&nbsp;(or LEGO Movie) minifigure collection or if you are a person who buys expensive minifigures like this. My&nbsp;personal rating is a 9/10. It would be a 10/10 if it would be available&nbsp;to the general public at a cheaper cost. If you can find this at a reasonable cost, you should buy it as you will love its cuteness (or it&#39;s cheeriness).&nbsp;</p>
