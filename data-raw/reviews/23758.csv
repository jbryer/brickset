<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is colorful, and has some nice prints of the set and minifigures, mine was a little bent up, being the last one in my Lego store.<br />
<br />
The instructions were equally well done, although mine were bent up in the box. This was no hindrance to the build however.</p>

<p>Any one familiar with my reviews knows I don&#39;t pay much heed to the box or instructions, since I, well, open the boxes and build them, and plan to keep my collection indefinitely, I don&#39;t keep the boxes and store the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Well there are a lot of various shades of green, including light green, three shades of transparent pieces, and a few black and yellow to even things out. Two &quot;light&quot; projectile launchers that fire the round 1x1 pieces, and two more &quot;heavy&quot; spring powered projectile launchers are included, and we get the transparent-ish cape like&nbsp;space Bat wings, one of the minifigure launchers, a few large wings and long &quot;boat&quot; body pieces...it might not hit the 10 cent per piece mark, but it gives a good variety of pieces. The set is more then the sum of it&#39;s parts though.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>?Sinestro - Casual fans will know him as Ryan Renolds&nbsp;mentor/drill sargeant/dissenting authority figure&nbsp;from that movie, but he&#39;s about the quintessential Green Lantern villain. He comes with a Ninjago-esque transparent weapon made up of clear yellow, has the J Jonah Jameson hair, a pink head and a yellow and black outfit to mirror his adversary&#39;s.</p>

<p>Space Batman - So everyone who has bought a DC set has Batman. Every non-Superman themed set has one, and I&#39;m surprised he didn&#39;t pop up in the Superman movie sets as a teaser. This one is different though, similar to the &quot;snow commando&quot; Batman from the Mr Freeze/Aquaman set from last year. White suit and cowl, the aforementioned wings, secured with two coin pieces to a transparent back pack piece, and&nbsp;a different golden faced head (...sealing the mask in the vacuum of space I guess?) are moved in for this, and he does look different. I mean another Cyborg or Flash variant would have been cool too, but this is just the second Batman of this wave, so he&#39;s cooler then the usual Batmen.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it, nothing else to see here.<br />
<br />
Jokes, I bought it just for the Green Lantern mini figure. It could have been three times the price and been a terrible set, and I&#39;d still have willingly handed the money over. He comes with a green version of Sinestro&#39;s outfit, has a two sided masked head (scowling and smiling), his standard brown hair, and a brickbuilt lantern, which I think in context of the instructions and photos, is stolen by Sinestro. A weapon or colored construct of some kind would have been great, but the set did come with a spare green projectile he can use as a club or a spear. I guess the other part is that he has his own jet, so I can&#39;t say the guy&#39;s undergunned.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A quick build, I think at most it was two bags, but it was fast and to the point...and the special feature of the jet took me until it was finished for me to discover it&#39;s feature. It is a small set, and for me had a few small surprises</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I will just come out and say this: It looks like an old Russian or Chinese MIG aircraft, but scrunched up. Still super neat, and the armaments are top notch, and if they made it in gray they&#39;d have a neat military set going. The colours&nbsp;match GL&#39;s, and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s a construct of his ring, but the plane is really neat.</p>

<p>The standing structure also has a piece that can easily be moved back, opening the structure and releasing the lantern, or captured Batman, or what ever you think is the best prize for Sinestro to have. Any of the launchers, minifigure, light or heavy, all work to move the key piece back. It makes for a fun game, which is kind of a bonus.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a usual offering of a $25 (CDN) licensed&nbsp;set on paper. You get a small play set and three figures, maybe a key artifact to the comic or movie story, and one villain vs. two heroes. I wanted to be unimpressed by this set, truth be told, so I could gripe about Green Lantern&#39;s ignoble launch, and how he was included in a hastily assembled set. But like a lot of sets like these ones, I am again rather impressed. You get a cool looking jet, that has a genius&nbsp;firing mechanism, and a target that actually reacts to being fired upon. That alone would make this a great set. Make GL, Batman and Sinestro as three spacemen, or military guys, and palette swap the pieces, and I&#39;d still be satisfied with the set. Getting a long anticipated minifigure, his arch-nemisis and...well a Batman...goes to make this a must buy.</p>

"ModularRoger","2015-04-19T01:06:09.227Z","Better Than Expected","<p>At first, from a distance, this set did not excite me much but I picked it up on a whim and have to say that I am very impressed, and glad to have it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Usually I do not get attached to the boxes, but this one is very nice looking and I have held onto it. The imagery on both sides is terrific, with starfields and lunarscapes&nbsp;doing a great job of priming one&#39;s imagination for play or display.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The big thrill here is all of the green, in several shades both transparent and opaque and beyond the expected studs and&nbsp;small pieces, there are some nice larger plates. Also, there are no stickers. The two logo-pieces are printed, thankfully.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All three of them are nice. It would have been cool for Green Lantern to have a smaller handheld construct accessory like Sinestro does. One could probably customize such a thing with a green lightsaber blade, etc.&nbsp;The last thing that I needed was another Batman minifigure, but I found myself loving this one with his astronaut-themed printing and silver cowl/helmet (let&#39;s call it a &#39;cowlmet&#39;).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy, quick, not too exciting but it was interesting to see how the built-in firing&nbsp;mechanism for the missiles came together. Excellent design there.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The thing that has impressed me the most about this set is the very thing that looked the least compelling when I first saw pictures of it last year: the spacecraft. While I am one who likes Green Lantern having a ship as opposed to just flying around by himself, this ship seemed simple and unimaginative at a glance. Holding it in my hand, however, I have fallen in love with how easy it is to swoosh with two fingers, how playable it is--high powered missiles and stud-shooters--and how fantastic it looks flying in front of a lamp with transparent green portions glowing.</p>

<p>This set is basically the same layout as the 76000-1 Batman/Aquaman/Mr. Freeze set but I like the &quot;holding cell&quot; cell better in this one. The Sinestro Corps logo is a great target to fire missiles at.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For the price, this is a great value. You get three brand-new minifigures and once assembled, the whole thing feels much more substantial than its piece-count would suggest. Deceptively attractive vehicle, nice assortment of interesting-colored parts. Would definitely recommend.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T21:44:03.34Z","First of the Lantern Corps","<p><strong>Set #76025 Green Lantern vs. Sinestro: </strong>DC Super Heroes are finally beginning to get out of the every set should be about Batman phase. With this latest batch of sets we are treated to some interesting new characters. First up Green Lantern and his arch nemesis Sinestro!</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: New to the designs for these sets this year are the Justice League logos and a group shot of the JL, other than that the box design is pretty much the same we&rsquo;ve seen before from LEGO DC Super Heroes. It does showcase the set quite nicely though and all of the play features. It also advertises the Super Jumper, a new LEGO piece designed for imitating super heroes ability to leap into the air and achieve flight.</p>

<p>Instructions: The instructions detail the builds in this set quite well, as is typical in most LEGO sets. You won&rsquo;t find difficult or frustrating elements during the build and no stickers, what little detail work is found in this set is printed elements. For cross promotional images found in the last few pages you will find some images for this year&rsquo;s sets, some for LEGO Movie sets and a two-page ad for the new Justice League vs. Bizarro League.</p>

<p>Comic: This year&rsquo;s comic focuses on the story surrounding the sets from The Justice League. There are pages detailing action and typical LEGO brand humour from all of the sets except for the Target only exclusive. The back cover also features a handy Minifigure checklist for the sets from this year.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The set features a predominant number of black and green pieces. Standard plates, bricks and other pieces, including studs. The newest pieces found in this set are the new style of stud launcher, found on Green Lantern&rsquo;s plane. The radar dish with the Sinestro Corps logo printed on it might also be extremely useful to own multiples of, other than that I don&rsquo;t find anything too unique from this set.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Green Lantern: This new super hero looks like he just stepped out of the LEGO movie, his costume is a double-sided torso print and leg printing. He includes two expressions, a serious determined to save the day expression and a happy smiling face. For accessories he includes a nicely constructed Green Lantern Power Battery, it uses nine pieces and is about the height of a Minifigure, which is really disproportionate, however is an awesome micromodel accessory for the character.</p>

<p>Space Batman: Another variation of Batman, taken straight out of LEGO Batman 3 Beyond Gotham. This version of Batman has a white torso with a double-sided torso print depicting his space suit, his legs are plain white with a grey belt, no printing. His backpack uses a brand new bracket piece in clear plastic, it attaches a thin plastic wing cape to the back using a 1x2 plate for his jetpack with rods and half cylinders to mimic engines.</p>

<p>His cowl is a new piece in a nice metallic silver colour. He includes a single batarang accessory, a spare head for when he isn&rsquo;t in space and a spare cape for when he&rsquo;s not in-flight. The main facial print on the white Minifigure head resembles the breathing mask worn by Scuba Suit Batman from 2014.</p>

<p>Sinestro: The Arch Nemesis of the Green Lantern Corps and a former GL himself, Sinestro is decked out in his customary yellow uniform. It&rsquo;s a double-sided torso print with leg printing a black version of Joker&rsquo;s hairpiece and a double-sided facial print. One side is angry the other a more neutral sinister expression.</p>

<p>For his accessory he is given a yellow clear rod with a Ninjago Technic Blade piece in yellow clear plastic. No Yellow Lantern ring to be seen, which is unfortunate as it would have been nice to see them re-use the one ring piece sculpted specifically for LotR in different plastic colours to represent the rings used by members of any Lantern Corps. Though it wouldn&rsquo;t have been accurate. It&rsquo;s just a shame, the animated specials feature actual power rings, but LEGO has chosen not to sculpt them yet as new pieces for whatever reason.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The main build featured in this set is mostly a Green Lantern jet, which is build using mostly green pieces, representing a lantern construct. Though some black elements are used, I suppose to give it more colour. The build is entirely straight forward and deals with simple, easy to follow steps, the small Lantern holding construct of Sinestro&rsquo;s is designed to keep GL&rsquo;s power battery captive, and features part of the play functionality of the set.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s build is also quite simple and easy, without any difficult moments. All in all the build is actually quite satisfying, despite being limited due to the number of pieces involved, since this is meant to be a cheap set for fans of the theme.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Green Lantern jet is pretty much a vehicle for a character that can already fly, similar to the Invisible Jet, its design looks pretty good for a GL Construct, it might have been interesting to see the model in all transparent green and black bricks, however I can understand why LEGO wouldn&rsquo;t want to use that as it would mean making far too many new pieces in transparent ABS.</p>

<p>Anyway, the jet includes two flick-fire missiles, to fire them there is a Technic pin and gear system built into the rear of the jet, turn it left or right and you can fire one of the missiles. There are also two stud launchers.</p>

<p>Sinestro has captured GL&rsquo;s Power Battery and placed it inside of a yellow fear construct. This model is designed for the Super Jumper play feature introduced with these new DC Justice League sets. The Super Jumper apparently has a design flaw that damages Minifigure legs when used. The play feature is to hit the large printed Sinestro Corps dish to break open the cage and free the Power Battery.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a great set for picking up and I&rsquo;m glad that LEGO finally gave us a set featuring Green Lantern. Before this set the only way to have him was by getting the SDCC or NYCC exclusive Minifigure. It&rsquo;s also nice to start seeing more Justice League inspired sets, even if the models are not as iconic as some of Batman&rsquo;s vehicles. It&rsquo;s also nice to have more villains, it would have been nice to see a Red Lantern here as well, however it is what it is and I recommend picking it up for the holidays.</p>

"redbeardlegoman","2017-05-07T05:18:55.033Z","A great start, but let's get some more GL sets.","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the best sets I&#39;ve ever bought, and is near perfect in my opinion. &nbsp;It&#39;s a great start, and I hope it will eventually be known as the first of the great Lantern sets.<br />
<br />
<strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
<br />
It has them.<br />
<br />
<strong>Parts</strong><br />
<br />
I&#39;m not sure how many of the parts are new, but I would like to comment on the parts I like, and some thoughts on what parts I would like.<br />
<br />
The printed Green and Yellow Lantern parts on the jet and container are sure to please those who hate stickers. Though I&#39;m fine with stickers, it&#39;s nice that these are printed, and I think they look excellent. &nbsp;I sometimes think the green lantern logo would stand out better in lighter green, or with a white background, but I&#39;m content nonetheless.</p>

<p>The green lantern power battery is well-made with a few parts.</p>

<p>I think that it&#39;s cool that Space Batman comes with folded and extended wings. &nbsp;Having them made of thick plastic sheeting is a good idea.</p>

<p>Sinestro&#39;s&nbsp;weapon is great. &nbsp;It even carries his vicious perspective in a nice leitmotif.</p>

<p>I wish that it were possible to make more of the jet out of transparent green parts. &nbsp;I&#39;ve heard that transparent parts are prone to become inseparable when locked together for a long period of time. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know if that is true, and if so, I hope it can be overcome some day. &nbsp;As a big fan of the GL comics, I would prefer to see transparent constructs. &nbsp;Having said that, the transparent, green and black combination works (though I&#39;d maybe have gone with more green).</p>

<p>I should also say that I am glad to see that the action-jumping piece thing is not coming out in newer sets. &nbsp;Mine all sit in a small sorting compartment, because even though I hate them, I can&#39;t bring myself to throw them away.</p>

<p>If I could wish for a part, it would be the rings. &nbsp;Could there not be&nbsp;green and yellow transparent versions of the One Ring from the LOTR sets?</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>If you must shoehorn Batman into every set, do it like this! &nbsp;Space Batman?! &nbsp;If I have to explain to you how awesome that is, you won&#39;t understand it. &nbsp;To top it off, this minfigure looks excellent. &nbsp;Anyone who wishes to build a Batcave MOC cannot call it complete without this batsuit.</p>

<p>I honestly believe that this Green Lantern looks better than the Comic Con release of years before. &nbsp;Not that I would ever turn that one down, I much prefer this one. &nbsp;I think it captures what I see in my head when I think of Hal Jordan.<br />
<br />
Sinestro is, I feel, the runaway star of the set (which I am sure he would agree with). &nbsp;He&#39;s garbed in his Sinestro Corps uniform, which pays homage to the jesterly stylings of his original outfit while mercifully not being it. &nbsp;The pink of his head is the perfect shade of the Korugarian&nbsp;tyrant. &nbsp;His facial expressions with his burning yellow eyes are good enough that I wish I had a second minifigure just to have both on display.<br />
<br />
If I could make any changes to either figure they would be as follows:</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if dual-moulded legs were made at the time, but that should be a natural for any future iterations.</p>

<p>I would also have given Sinestro an elf hairpiece with the same shade of pink on the ears. &nbsp;Well, maybe. &nbsp;The shape of the hairpiece used is closer to the widow&#39;s peak Sinestro sports. &nbsp;I&#39;m kinda&nbsp;torn. &nbsp;Is it too much to ask for a new mould? &nbsp;Maybe.</p>

<p>Having said that, though, I am still thrilled with these minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build was pretty simple and straight-forward. &nbsp;Nothing really remarkable, but a fun steak-and-potatoes build all the same.<br />
<br />
I made a couple of changes - namely changing around the transparent green air scoops on the sides to face backwards, making the body more streamlined.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>This is fun to play with right away. &nbsp;The well-integrated spring shooters and darts make it fun to shoot the target dish on Sinestro&#39;s cage around the power battery. &nbsp;Even the stud shooters are at least sensible on a fighter jet. &nbsp;And whether or not you bring Batman into the action, he&#39;s certainly the most swooshable minifigure&nbsp;I&#39;ve got. &nbsp;He&#39;s ready to help take on Brainiac in his skull ship, or an invading Darkseid.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>I hope that this is the first set in a long-line of Lantern Corps sets. &nbsp;With the upcoming John Stewart and ship in the Build Your Own Adventure book/set, I am optimistic that I could one day have a Carol Ferris Star Sapphire, an Atrocitus&nbsp;big fig, a Saint Walker Blue Lantern, even an avaricious Larfleeze and his army of Orange Constructs.</p>

<p>There are many sets that I berate myself for not picking up when I could. &nbsp;I am very happy that this was not one of them.</p>

"JVM","2015-08-25T11:04:48.33Z","Strong Set for it's Price Point","<p>Part of a new wave of DC Super Heroes sets inspired by <em>Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham</em>, this is one of many new sets that begin to emphasize the Justice League and it&#39;s members over Batman and begin to really expand on the DC Universe -- and it features the long-awaited release of Hal Jordan as Green Lantern! But is it a worthwhile $19.99 purchase?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box shows a very appropriate space-y background that&#39;s a nice break from all of the &#39;city&#39;-style backgrounds on LEGO sets, and shows off the action features, besides an uncessary emphasis on the new &#39;Super Jumper&#39; feature. The instructions are typical and I had no major issues following them this time around. The box also emphacizes the Justice League aspect, also a nice break from the almost purely Batman focus of the last three years.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set contains three totally new minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Space Batman: </strong>While it&#39;s a little disappointing that DC sees fit to include Batman in almost every set in this theme, it&#39;s great to see him in an all-new suit and the space suit is pretty cool, with two sets of wings, a new backpack piece that is pretty useful, and a new mask. It&#39;s a good representative for a new suit and he&#39;ll be a fun minifigure to see helping save the galaxy beyond Gotham.</p>

<p><strong>Green Lantern / Hal Jordan: </strong>After three or four years, it&#39;s great to finally see Green Lantern appearing in a LEGO set, and luckily it&#39;s an affordable one. That alone makes this a pretty important minifigure release, not to mention he&#39;s essential to most Justice Leagues. The two faces are one determined and one grinning,&nbsp; which seem appropriate for the character, and the mask is pretty detailed compared to, for example, Robin. The white gloves are an accurate choice but stick out a bit due to the minifigure&#39;s black-and-green color scheme. It&#39;s not as shiny or colorful as the Comic Con version&#39;s greens, but this is more comic and game accurate. The choice of Hal Jordan makes some sense given he is the version featured in the recent GL film, LEGO movie, Batman game, and most spin-off Green Lantern media today, but here&#39;s hoping the iconic John Stewart is on the way, too. I slightly wish he had a piece to represent his ring, such as a couple green (any shade!) transuculuent 1x1 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Sinestro: </strong>An unexpected but welcome addition is Green Lantern&#39;s former mentor and arch-nemesis, Sinestro, recreated quite well with his purple-pink skin, a devilish snarl, slicked black hair and his yellow-and-black Sinestro Corps uniform. A great choice to expand our Legion of Dooms! He has a special weapon made from transuculent yellow but I found it a little difficult to figure out what it was - nonetheless, it&#39;s addition is appreciated and quite meaningful to give the villain a way to menace our heroes.</p>

<p>It might have been nice to see one more character here but it&#39;s hard to think of an especially appropriate choice. Perhaps someone to pilot the ship? Carol Ferris could work - it&#39;d be more female representation, she&#39;s logical as a pilot who can&#39;t normally fly, and she adds to the Green Lantern side of the lore. Most members of the JLA are capable of flight after all.</p>

<h3>The Set</h3>

<p><strong>The Parts: </strong>There&#39;s a couple unique parts here that even I know of -- Sinestro&#39;s weapon is made of a new piece and the familiar bar in the new color of transuculent yellow. I believe many of these transculuent green pieces are in that color for the first time as well, including the canopy. I might&#39;ve used more greens and less blacks personally. Batman&#39;s transuculent &#39;backpack&#39; and mask are new pieces for 2015 as well, and both welcome additions. The new super jumpers are an idea I love and support in theory but they can cause damage to figures - and probably to little fingers - so I don&#39;t recommend using them myself.</p>

<p><strong>The Build: </strong>Not much to say here. You&#39;d be hard-pressed to find a fascinating build at a small price point, in my opinion. I haven&#39;t personally built a lot of aircraft so it was a little interesting to piece together a jet, but I imagine to any AFOL or most TFOL&#39;s, this is something they&#39;ve done dozens of times before.</p>

<p><strong>The Model: </strong>We have a small tower with a green lantern and a ship presumably made from the parts of Hal&#39;s Ring. The former is a simple build but it works well for it&#39;s intended purpose and has some playability as the tower can be opened and another figure can be inserted, such as Sinestro or Hal Jordan. The &#39;jet&#39; makes no sense from a story standpoint - neither Space Batman nor Green Lantern need any kind of ship - but it&#39;s a charming little build that&#39;s surprisingly durable despite it&#39;s size. I&#39;m a big fan of the new spring missiles and shooters, which work a lot better than the old flick-fires, and they blend into the build well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a very strong set for it&#39;s price point, and while it&#39;s main source of value to the more experienced builders and collectors will be a great roster of minifigures, including the long-awaited Green Lantern himself, kids and younger collectors will take more interest in the play feature-packed jet and the lantern tower in addition to the great heroes. It&#39;s a set worth picking up for most LEGO fans!</p>

"Professor_X","2015-09-08T20:10:08.523Z","""In brightest day, in blackest night...""","<p>With nearly every DC Comics set being based on Batman, It was very exciting when a Justice League subtheme was announced. This set in particular, due to the Green Lantern minifigure, got me and &nbsp;many others very excited, and I couldn&#39;t wait to get my hands on it. If you had high expectations for this set, you won&#39;t be disappointed. To show&nbsp;you why, let&#39;s take a look at the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build:</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build consisted of 3 parts; The minifigures, Sinestro&#39;s&nbsp;containment unit, and of course, the Green Lantern Jet. a super jumper is also included, as well as a comic&nbsp;book&nbsp;which chronicles every set in the wave.&nbsp;While the build was very quick and not especially complicated, I was so excited to get it I enjoyed it much more than I anticipated!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures:</p>

<p>Green Lantern:</p>

<p>&nbsp; Fans have been waiting since the release of the Green Lantern Comic-Con exclusive back in 2011 for a Green Lantern Minifigure to appear in sets. This one is no disappointment. Based on his New 52 version, Hal Jordan is an amazing minifigure. The bright green contrasts incredibly well with the black and white on hisgloves and logo to form a very eye-catching minifigure. Green Lantern has two expressions, one very stern and the other with a goofy smile. He has no accessories unless you count the actual &#39;Green Lantern&#39; that&#39;s included.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sinestro:</p>

<p>&nbsp; It&#39;s been really great to see not only so many new DC super heroes but also so many great Super Villain minifigures, and Sinestro is certainly one of them. The black and yellow of Sinestro&#39;s costume combined with his fuchsia&nbsp;head makes him an extremely eye-catching minifigure compared to Green Lantern. He appears to also be based on his New 52 version, and his head has two expressions, one serious and the other angry. Sinestro is armed with a construct staff made of the first ever see-through yellow bar piece&nbsp;and a see-through yellow blade piece from the Ninjago theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Space Batman:</p>

<p>&nbsp; While I&#39;m not very fond of all the different Batman suits, this one is very unique. Space Batman&nbsp;Is mainly white and grey, and while he certainly isn&#39;t&nbsp;as eye-catching as the other two minifigures, he has some really nice detailing on his torso and he sports an exclusive silver Batman cowl. There are two strange things about this minifigure. The first are his wings, which are clamped in place with a plate to a new see-through neck bracket piece. Two sets of wings are included, one set is folded in while the other is opened in the classic bat-shape. The other strange thing are his head pieces. One head is printed with a space mask, while the other is reused from past versions of Batman. The second head looks strange because of the lack of a chin strap on the new cowl.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Completed Set:</p>

<p>Sinestro&#39;s&nbsp;Containment unit:</p>

<p>&nbsp; While this is obviously a piece-filler, it is none the less a nice model. It can be used either to contain the brick-built green lantern or to hold a minifigure. The dish printed with the Sinestro Corps logo can be hit with a minifigure by launching it from the super&nbsp;jumper. This causes the front part of containment unit to fling forward, releasing whatever&#39;s locked inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Green Lantern Jet:</p>

<p>&nbsp; The Green Lantern jet, which makes up the bulk of the set, contains a lot of interseting pieces including two see-through light green fins and a nose piece printed with the Green Lantern Corps logo. The jet can seat one minifigure and is heavily armed with stud shooters and spring-loaded missiles. The missiles can be shot by turning an engine piece in the back. This is accomplished by threading a technic pin through the jet which is attached to a short technic piece at one end and the engine piece at the other. This piece taps the missles, shooting them off. The only flaw in this is that the missiles have to be shot of individually, but I think this can be overlooked since it isn&#39;t that big of a jet.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts:&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; With three exclusive minifigures, an interesting model, and a $24.99(CA)/$19.99(US) price point, if your a Super Hero fan buying this set is a no-brainer. If you&#39;re looking for rare parts, this set definitely fits the bill with at least four exclusive pieces and many more rare ones. So in other words, my conclusion is: GET-THIS-SET!</p>
