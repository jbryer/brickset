"TheGlynreaper","2015-02-04T20:12:11.41Z","one of the best Micro Managers YET","<p>While a lot of people may buy this set for the Super Angry&nbsp;Unikitty&nbsp;and Batman Figures to me the overlooked star of this set is the micro-manager</p>

<p>Box/Instructions the set comes in a small box similar to the getaway glider and melting room set and the instructions of course are containing of one booklet</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - other than the exclusive Super Angry&nbsp;Unikitty&nbsp;parts theres nothing new parts wise to tell</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures - the skeletron is just a basic figure that is already available in other sets but it comes with a gun that has a red roundish piece on top beware though as when holding the weapon the minifig becomes a bit top heavy , Batman is the same batman as in the movie which shows due to his expressions on his double printed face his butt kicking mode and screaming mode also i dont know if its me but his legs seem shorter than the dc universe and LEGO Batman versions he also comes equipped with his buildable grappling hook/blaster weapon that is seen in the movie also he comes with his trusty batarang and lastly the exclusive Super Angry&nbsp;Unikitty&nbsp;which while isnt a minifigure but a buildable figure of 14 pieces&nbsp;it has some nice prints on the parts</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build - the build is very simple but also very very fun batman and skeletron will have trouble standing with the weapons in hands , the highlight to me is the micro manager which is one of the best yet as some of the other efforts were pretty weak</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model - as ive said before the micro manager is amazing compared to others as for once the gimmicks actually work , at glance you will notice a small tab at the back so as super angry unikitty go behind press down on the tab and the 2 front panels will fly off and not just drop but go a decent distance destroying the micro manager it has also 2 push missiles at the front which can be projected by pressing in the 6083620 pieces</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion for a set consisting of 2 minifigures , 1 buildable figure and a micro manager i cant believe how much fun im having with this set , if you are into collecting the lego movie minifigures or the micro managers then i reccommend this set</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-10-25T19:06:11.55Z","What's this feeling? I'm getting VERY ANGRY!","<p><strong>Set #70817 Batman &amp; Super Angry Kitty Attack: </strong>In 2015 three more LEGO Movie sets were introduced to fans and collectors alike. And while nowhere near as impressive as the sets introduced in the Summer of 2014, these three new sets did offer up something interesting. This one however is one of the weakest offerings from the LEGO Movie Theme. And the reason why? Read on to find out.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: This box is tiny. Literally this is the smallest box from this Theme yet and while it does include all of the impressive design choices from the Theme I have to admit this one doesn&rsquo;t do nearly as well enough as the others in showcasing the set and making you want it. Because mostly the Minifigures turn out to be the big draw of this set, sadly.</p>

<p>Instructions: Very straight forward and easy to follow. Sharing in the design of past LEGO Movie Theme manuals. I do have to bring up again, the fact that LEGO chose not to include Minifigure Checklists with any of the Movie instruction manuals is a bit unfortunate. It would have been nice to see a large poster image showing off the various different Minifigures from the Theme all together, because some of them have origins in Themes of their own, such as Batman, Johnny Thunder, The Green Ninja and of course the other Master Builders.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set is pretty poor for parts. Nothing in it stands out to me as useful for parts packs or MOCs. It&rsquo;s just a small number of parts, the most unique offerings are the Unikitty facial print and the new head for Batman. Basically Minifigure pieces.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Speaking of which, this set includes two Minifigures and a buildable character. Some interesting choices for this set actually, let&rsquo;s discuss each one now.</p>

<p>Skeletron: The same grey robot-skeleton we&rsquo;ve seen in past LEGO Movie sets there isn&rsquo;t much new being brought to the table here, it&rsquo;s just a basic skeleton with a robot facial print. This one gets to carry a nice weapon. The new gun piece commonly found in the possession of Lord Business&rsquo;s army. What more can I say?</p>

<p>Batman: Using the same old cowl piece we&rsquo;ve long associated with him, Batman in this set features a brand new facial print that matches some of his expressions from scenes in the movie. It is awesome! At last LEGO makes different faces for the Dark Knight, separate from all the common faces found in the DC Super Heroes line. He&rsquo;s the big draw to the set, he also includes a batarang and a buildable grapple gun.</p>

<p>The grapple gun uses your LEGO Space gun first introduced in the past few years, with some additional pieces added onto simulate the look and design of his grapple gun. It is a very impressive little micro-build and I&rsquo;m glad to see LEGO finally acknowledging this accessory in proper minifigure scale. It&rsquo;s much better than the old LEGO Batman unique sculpted pieces that were used to make the grapple gun back in 2005/06.</p>

<p>Super Angry Kitty: She&rsquo;s back and she&rsquo;s angrier than ever. This version of Unikitty is in her flaming red and orange angry colours with tufts of orange print around her legs making it look like she&rsquo;s on fire. Her face has closed eyes and her mouth is open revealing her sharp teeth. She&rsquo;s prepared to put an end to Lord Business&rsquo; robotic army of micro managers.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>There is really very little to build in this set. You are building a new Micromanager and it&rsquo;s going to be very quick of you to build them. Personally I would have preferred it if they included pieces to build Unikitty&rsquo;s Super Angry head, the massive brick-built head she uses when she gets really angry. Sadly that isn&rsquo;t the case so you&rsquo;re stuck with a fairly dull build. Unless you enjoy the micromanagers at this scale.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Micromanager in this set is fairly standard. It has a nice feature where you can push down on a plate at the top that causes the head to blow off. This is a really nice play feature, which stands out because it means you can have Batman or Super Angry Kitty utterly decimate this Micromanager.</p>

<p>It also fires two missiles by pushing on Technic axles in the back. This feature detracts from the model when seen from behind. It might have been nice to include a small clear stand for this Micromanager to hover on since it would have added to the piece count. The claw arms aren&rsquo;t new, we&rsquo;ve seen this same build on other Micromanagers at this scale.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>My overall opinion of this set is, you&rsquo;re basically going to want it for Batman and Super Angry Unikitty. Skeletron isn&rsquo;t a big draw and the build of the set is fairly basic, without much to offer since it&rsquo;s just another Micromanager. The price for the set is a nice draw though, I can only mildly recommend it though because it&rsquo;s just lacking too much of a satisfying build. This honestly is like an accessory pack for The LEGO Movie Theme, not that, that is a bad thing, but it could have included more. We have yet to see Michelangelo the Artist from the rank of Master Builders, or even Dumbledore, which would have been nice to see as extra characters in this set during the climactic scene at the end of the movie.</p>
