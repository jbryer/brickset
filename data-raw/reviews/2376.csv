And I have to say I was a bit disappointed by this one.  I expected something more &amp; to have more pieces after 4505.  You can only build a couple of things from the instructions at the same time.  You only get 2 new trans canopies as opposed to 3 in the smaller set &amp; it could have done with more trapezoidal flags.  There are insufficient standard slopes &amp; inverted slopes, I would have thought there would be more of them to use in combnation with all the new curved slopes.

However my 4 year old is very pleased that I can make a pasasble stingray using the parts &amp; colours from this set",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
