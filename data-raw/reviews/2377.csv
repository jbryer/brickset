"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-08T16:47:42Z","Great cars","Just bought it today and was very surprised with the huge amount of instructions. There are a whopping 17 Instructions in a set with a total of 25 Models. The Tyres are looking good, but slightly too big for normal Lego City scale cars. There are plenty of useful pieces for MOC cars and trucks.
Now to the scale: The vehicles are mostly a little bit smaller then minifig-scale, but some are even real minifig scale. Some models even fit minifigs, when you modify them slightly, like taking out the interiors. There are a little bit less pieces then in the older 4100 but here are the smaller ones. Even some chrome parts, which I haven't seen very often are included in this set.
Overall a great 10/10 for me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I went into the LEGO store and emerged from my Dark Ages that I had been in for about 20 years. 
I bought this set on clearance at Target shortly after coming home from my vacation. Target is my favorite store and I would always pick up LEGO sets and put them down after talking myself out of buying them. I guess after being able to play with LEGO at the LEGO store, coupled with the immense sculptures and talking to a LEGO builder at the store, I was hooked and &quot;had to buy&quot; this set.

This set is a great source of red parts, slopes, wedges and plates. The main models are beautiful as are the inspiration models. I built a Jeep Cherokee styled vehicle and this set was a wise choice because there are so many parts when compared to the Tiny Turbos I could have bought for the same price. I got this for 4.98 at Target, the same price as a TT. I was excited to see that even though there were different parts than I remembered from my childhood the building experience hadn't changed. Creator sets are some of my favorite to buy because of the tons of ideas included in the instruction booklets and countless possibilities each set presents us with. They are also a great way to build your stock of certain colors. need green, buy the Mythical Creatures set #4894, need dark red buy 4507, Prehistoric Creatures. 

If you enjoy building vehicles and can still get your hands on this set, I would highly recommend adding this set and pieces to your collection.

Thank you Downtown Disney and the LEGO store! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
