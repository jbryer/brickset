This is no exception, and while we are now nearing the end of the Chima Theme, some might say similar to Ninjago before it, how fitting that there comes a book such as this. One that details every mini-figure from the Theme. Or just about.</p>

<p>Presentation</p>

<p>The book itself shares the layout we&rsquo;ve come to expect from Character Encyclopedias. With images of the characters on the front and back you know what to expect. Also of interest is that the book itself has a white background for the cover, similar to the other books of this sort, meaning that they will look uniform on the shelf.</p>

<p>Again you have so many pages 176 to be precise, with facts and pictures aplenty. I&rsquo;m still not a fan of the thicker front-cover, I understand it is to keep the Mini-Figure safe during shipping and all that, however it makes the book just a tad thicker masking the actual number of pages and I feel shamelessly pads the price up due to the thicker stock for the cover. It also causes the shelf space to be reduced when you put all of these books side-by-side. Still it is to be expected when you start picking up books of this sort.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Firox: I believe this is one of the most detailed figures to come with one of DK&rsquo;s books, being a Chima Minifigure that shouldn&rsquo;t be much of a surprise. Firox is a member of the Fire Tribe, a phoenix to be precise, he has a double-sided torso print, detailed leg printing, the standard phoenix head piece with printing around the eyes, a double-sided facial print whose only notable differences seem to be that one side is smiling and the other is frowning, very hard to spot without looking at the printed beak.</p>

<p>He includes a golden shoulder armour piece with gold clips for the orange wings and an orange Fire printed Chi stud. All-in-all a very impressive looking Minifigure. Interesting bit of trivia this is not the first character to be named Firox, one of the Power Miners Rock Monsters from 2009 shares this name. Naturally they aren&rsquo;t the same character, but it is interesting that LEGO would re-use the name for a different Theme after so many years.</p>

<p>Contents</p>

<p>Broken up into short chapters for each of the Chima Tribes, the book covers every Minifigure and set from 2013 and 2014 with a few pages at the end of the book showing all of the Minifigures (or just about, some variants may be absent) and all of the sets.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that they produced this before 2015 sets were finalized as it stands to reason that an updated and expanded edition will be required to feature the last few Minifigures from the last spattering of sets that 2015 gave us.</p>

<p>The pages are very interesting and are what you&rsquo;d expect from this sort of book, I will note that there may or may not be mistakes. I am not 100% when it comes to accurate facts, and like with any printing of this sort it is to be expected that some elements might slip through the cracks, or be mis-quoted.</p>

<p>I find it interesting and impressive that even the CHI Constraction figures are represented in this book, even having pages dedicated to the first wave. The second, harder to come by wave, is suspiciously absent for whatever reason.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>In the end I&rsquo;d say this is a great companion piece for fans of the Theme. It details many of the characters and their backstories, shows a decent catalogue of Minifigures and includes a unique character for the Fire Tribe. Sadly while I would recommend picking this up, it might not hurt to wait and see if an updated version is in the works to finish off the Theme properly and include every set from Chima.</p>
