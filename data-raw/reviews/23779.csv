The LEGO police car was a great set. it was very fun to build and had a cool look. the parts were very good and i loved the double windshield but i wish the clocking tool could fit in the car. when i got this set, it was already discontinued. I really wanted it because i loved the design. It looks great on my shelves and is fun to push around. It really is a fun set.&nbsp;</p>
