"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-17T13:08:29Z","Excellent House","First of all I must admit I didn't have this set, but I would definitely buy it if it is available in my country (this set is sold in Europe only at this moment). Not only the house looks nice, the bricks it contains (white bricks, roofs, windows and doors) are useful for building any other kinds and style of building. I would bet if TLC makes it available worldwide it will be a bestseller!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-06T20:42:27Z","Wow! Really good House by old style","I think that most of LEGO manias want to this set for house making. Because of the roof, window &amp; door block is too hard to take nowadays.

This set is mini figuer size. Moreover, there are lots of 1x1 tiles in this set.

For the LEGO town dreamer, this set is good solution.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T06:12:23Z","AWSOME","I have been waiting ages for lego to release some more or atleast 1 more house set like they use to and they finnaly have. I dont care how much this one costs becuase im getting it ass soon as i see it. These houses look nice and on lego.com theres another pick. Its a windmill house. 10/10 for me! One of the best new 2004 sets they have made!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-11T13:16:15Z","best","i dont know about you guys but i think this is the best town set lego has made in years. i dont think they have put this much detail and effort into a town set since the early 1990s.  i have to give it up to lego for taking my heart back to the true style of legos.  :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-18T08:46:09Z","I love the......, o I just love it all!!!","I got it off the internet and when it came in I thought I could wait a while before starting to build! 

Well that lasted about half an hour, then I couldn't control myself anymore. I had to build (especially since it has been a looooooooong while since lego made something as nice as this!)and I did not stop till the roof was on.

This house is standing next too my already classic 361 house, but they look great together. The one a classic the other one an instant classic. 
I can see my daughter sitting here, in thirty years, and she'll probably look back at 4886 as I'm looking back at 361. Remenising about a time when they made real lego!

Just one minor point, they should have put an old tree in and not build one from scratch. But that's just me. Go get this one if you're into building!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-30T06:20:07Z","Close to perfect","Excellent set. Lots of very useful bricks and good instructions and ideas. In my view there are two minor mistakes. It is strange with only 1 shutter on each front window (?) and there are no windows on the back and on one side. It still rates a 10 though since if not for these minor flaws it would simply be the best set ever!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-30T09:30:48Z","Nice House","I just bought this yesterday while went for shopping to LEGOLAND G&#252;nzburg. I know, I'm getting there very often since I'ts only one hour away from me.
Now i'm reviewing some of the models:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Small house (quick build):
This house is very small. There's much space around that building. The Architectural style of this is ok for the size. There's a streetlamp near the building and a garden around it. The plants are custom build The only thing that makes me mad is the bad look of the chimney. It's looking very ugly with this style. 9/10 
-----------------------------------------------------------
2. Medium House (experienced build):
This house also uses a rather small footprint. So there's space for the garden, which is better looking at this house. The plants are custom build again, which is a nice touch as this isn't common to lego sets building the plants with just basic bricks Slopes or plates not with special plant parts. The Building itself has many storeys and very classic techniques, because of the 4 Walls and the non existant floors it's just like old 70s style. There are architectural elements in that building, like 2 colors on the corners, which looks good. But again the damned look of the chimney. But it get's a 10/10 for architectural details.
-----------------------------------------------------------
3. Building Bonanza (Advanced Build):
This house rocks. It's extremely realistic and minifig scale. The Garden looks pretty good with it's position. The plants are custom built like in all houses of the set. The house has no interior as all houses of the set, but this can be modified if you have enough bricks. The four walls take it very close to the old style from the 70s. This house uses over 600 pieces and there are still about 40 or 50 left over. The back has no windows, which takes it away from perfection, but the architectural style takes this very close. Simply a 10/10.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Overall: This set is the bomb when you're into buildings or if you need some very useful pieces for houses in classic town scale. Otherwise it's great on display altough not very well standin next to old LEGO Town buildings. It's simply a great outstanding set that really deserves a 10/10 in total.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-06T09:30:15Z","The house thta saved Lego...","This is one of the best Lego sets in years.

It's also a Designer sets which mean there would be no minifigures, you you want minifigs buy a System Theme set.

The house is great, the roof comes off, there are a ton of pices, all the roof pieces are great.

The things you can biuld with the set are wonder, a lighthouse, windmill, or the cool house.

Then on the inside you can set the house up any way you want with your own pieces so if you choose, you can play with the house as if it were a doll house.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-11T16:00:41Z","A House is always nice.","A great house with great pices, the other thing that could make it better would be a second floor.

No people, no problem, buy a minifig set.

The House has 600+ pieces for 40 American dollars, thats a great price!  Most 600 piece sets cost at least $70.

"David","2005-07-10T16:50:08Z","Traditional Construction","This set epitomizes traditional lego construction and I highly recommend it for anyone starting out with lego or anyone who wants to make, or has already built, a lego town.

The size is compatible with mini-figures, and although the set did not include any (this is a designer set afterall), the door and window elements are invaluable for a mini-figure scale theme; that and the roofing bricks meant I went out and got two of these sets for my town.

A suggestion for non-lego customisation: It looks great with an LED lighting the interior.

This is the best of the designer sets, in my opinion, and I hope it is a big seller for Lego.

"Cashcleaner","2007-02-17T12:31:08.687Z","Good Value","I think Lego is really going back to it's roots with this set, and the release of the Creator House (4956) in 2007 leads me to believe we'll see these types of kits in more abundance over the next few years.  It's not perfect however, and I would point out that the scale is a bit too large for minifigs.  Externally, while the set is nice and detailed, if you take a look inside you'll note that there really isn't a lot of space to put furnishings or figures.  Also, while the front facade and sides have all the vents, windows, and doors, the back of the model is completely blank.  I rear window or chimney would have been nice to break up the empty wall space.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-27T08:41:06.247Z","Super Dooper House!!","I mean, this is what every Lego house should be or should have been.  It is to scale with a minifig (except there's no upstairs, just an 'attic'), you just need to add a bed and some furniture.  The trees, bush, and flowers are all very detailed, and the stone walk is also very nice.  The windows can also tilt open, and there's a porch light as well.  There are shutters on the bottom floor's windows, and a white fence around the front yard.  It's a Lego dream house!

Pros:

-To scale with minifigs

-White fence

-Shutters

-Front door

-Porch light

-Stone walkway

-Trees, bush, and flower patches

-TONS of great pieces

Cons:

-No furniture

Altogether 6/5.  Great set, PLEASE get it if available!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pod120","2009-06-07T22:39:31.077Z","Two in One!","I bought this set with left over Christmas Money in January 2007, and at first was a bit disappointed with how much playability I received from it. However, I busted it up and left it in a plastic bag for a few months until I decided to make two separate houses on the two separate 16x32 stud base plates. One was a small cottage with a driveway, and the other a taller house with a small park next to it. I used more than 90 percent of the pieces between the two houses and got more playability from them as I did from the main set design. In the end I was happy I had gotten the set.

Pros
-Includes 2 16x32 stud baseplates and 2 doors so that two houses can be built at once!
-Trees and green baseplate increase set look and interest
-Windows, Paving and Roof elements broaden design variety

Cons
-Simply looks outdated compared to newer house sets such as Beach House and Family Home. It does not have so many interesting elements and real life objects. But I guess they could not have evolved without the existance of this set.
-Not a set I would suggest to search for now, but a great set that took Lego houses to a more modern level",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
