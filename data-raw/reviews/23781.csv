<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Love the mostly yellow Lego box -- feels very &quot;old school&quot; Lego. There is a cute little story about the bat and the pumpkin on the back. My daughter (age 3) really liked hearing the story.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good mix of black and gray parts. The set uses lots of SNOT-compatible parts, as well.?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was more interesting than I thought it would be for a holiday set. Nothing too tricky, but lots of small parts and some basic SNOT techniques meant my 3 year old couldn&#39;t really help much (she sorted the parts by color for me).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This bat is really cute! The wings, ears, and feet move for some good playability.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m always a sucker for the limited edition holiday sets. The cuteness of the bat made this set an impulse buy at the checkout of my local Lego store. It&#39;s one of the best holiday sets I&#39;ve grabbed -- cute, fun to play with, and a lot of good parts for the money. It certainly beats last Halloween&#39;s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40055-1/Halloween-Pumpkin"">pumpkin</a>!</p>

I know it&#39;s already reviewed, but I figured I&#39;d do this one since it&#39;s fairly fresh on my mind and I&#39;m surprised I found it there since it&#39;s apparently a lego exclusive, but I digress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I usually lean towards minifigure scale sets more but this one has a lot of charm, and had more playability than I thought it would, even though that doesn&#39;t usually mean much to me.</p>

<p>I like the way both the bat and the pumpkin are built up, with not many studs showing on either model. The flipper-like pieces used for the mouth and the teeth look nice, the wings have a cool set up that makes them turnable, and the pumpkin is, well, a pumpkin. The stem was really irritating getting on.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say pick this up if you happen to see it...somewhere, want a cool halloween set, or just a cool set like this for cheap.</p>
