<p>But what you give up is less colors of the rainbow and more standard colors.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has two seals at the top near the red handle. It picks up like a suitcase with two flaps that fold and overlap the sides. There isn&#39;t a seal on the side flaps.</p>

<p>It does feel rather light for 1000 pieces, though.</p>

<p>Lego has retired this product as of 2015.</p>
