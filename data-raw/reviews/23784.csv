"ModularRoger","2015-05-03T16:59:52.95Z","Small But Substantial","<p>The main attraction in this set is the Sabine Wren minifigure, but it has a number of other things going for it. I was trying to decide between this and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75048-1/The-Phantom"">75048 Phantom</a>&nbsp;but in the end, I think that Ezra&#39;s Speeder Bike is better on several levels.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has the typical &quot;bright&quot; artwork of the Star Wars: Rebels theme, looks fun and matches the show&#39;s aesthetic. The instructions, unsurprisingly, are split between the two speeder bikes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts are of course very small. The ones that stand&nbsp;out to me for their quantity here are the &quot;plates with perpendicular studs&quot; (such as&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6020193"">6020193</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6052126"">6052126</a>). So aside from building the proper models, this set provides a lot of detail-level parts to perhaps add finishing touches to larger MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As usual, the minifigures included run the gamut from the commonplace Stormtrooper to the first-time-ever Sabine Wren. The biggest single disappointment of this set is that Sabine does not have her Mandalorian helmet. Undoubtedly it is no coincidence that the large upcoming Imperial Assualt Carrier will include the helmet. Still, Sabine is a nice figure with two-tone hair, a good torso and a couple of blasters. (Although, it is perhaps notable that her character on the show has skin that is&nbsp;in-between &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; so the typical flesh-tone of her face and bare arms is not really accurate, if one is paying close attention.)&nbsp;This is the same Ezra Bridger as in the Phantom set, but here he has a lightsaber and a wrench instead of a blaster and a helmet.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">As they are basically the same exact design but with&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">different</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;colored bricks, I followed the instructions for Ezra&#39;s green/orange model and then had fun trying to build the </span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">S</span>tormtrooper&#39;s<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;bike without the instructions--oddly enough there is exactly one part difference, but it is not visible when the models are complete--just going by memory and using the already-completed one for reference. (I mostly succeeded.)</span></p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>The two speeder bikes are very dense, much heavier than one might imagine from a picture. Personally I enjoy the &quot;same design, different colors&quot; theme. The nose section can telescope out or in and each bike has two stud-shooters. Durability seems good overall, owing in part to the heavy construction method. And because these use so many &quot;common&quot; pieces, one could possibly construct more of them in different color schemes for other characters, or to use for staging races.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>My primary motivation in picking this set up was to complete the crew of the Ghost. Although the Phantom docks with the Ghost, this set (Ezra&#39;s Speeder Bike) is a better value in terms of brick-ratio, includes more minifigures and in my estimation Sabine trumps Chopper. The Ezra figures are a bit redundant, either way. Overall, this set is good bang for the buck and offers a lot of playability for the size. Probably the best value of any of the Rebels sets thus far.</p>

"goodbeard","2015-05-19T17:00:29.803Z","A very nice set, but the UK version is a little different!","<p>This is a fantastic little set for all ages, the swoop-bikes/speeder-bikes are very well constructed and will hold up to a lot of play. The caveat however is the UK version (and presumably international) is slightly different -- replacing part of the design which may affect it&#39;s playability.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice packaging, did not notice any errors in the instructions and they were very easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A great mix of parts in different colours, lots of those fantastic angular plates and some fantastic technic pieces make this a great set. <strong>However, </strong>I bought this set primarily for piece <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6129364"">6129364: Fric. Element, Cylinder</a> and was dismayed to find that is seemingly exclusive to the US sets; here in the UK that part of the model is replaced with <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4234599"">4234599: Technic Cross Block/Fork 2X2</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6054858"">6054858: Tube W/Double &Oslash;4.85</a>. Without the other piece to hand I am unable to test how this change has affected the strength of the model, though the extra connections suggests some fragility. The Technic Cross Block does seem more versatile but also has appeared in more sets, so many collectors may have this part already.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are nice, though it would have been good to have a helmet for Sabine. The helmet on the rebels style stormtrooper seems to just pop off, and while this hasn&#39;t been too much an issue you may want to keep your eye on it during play!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The first few steps feel very flimsy but once the main body of the speeder is built up a bit it feels very solid. Ezras is built first and the imperials is built second, I did not notice any differences between the builds other than the colour swap and less stickers -- which is actually a shame as it would have been nice to stick the imperial logo on!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A very solid build that is really fun to play with, my two boys enjoyed playing with it and managed to not break anything off!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really enjoyed this set, and although I did not get the pieces that I wanted it for, I am happy with the alternative that was used. Brickset holds the instructions for both US and UK/Int builds should anybody wish to perform a comparison. Overall, 5/5 would buy again!</p>

Ezra&rsquo;s lightsaber, in the series this is a unique device which acts as both a blaster and a lightsaber, combining elements from both weapons. In LEGO form it is a mediocre attempt at recreating the iconic weapon, instead of giving us a new hilt piece basically Ezra is wielding a binocular-saber. Yep, a pair of LEGO binoculars are used for the hilt, meaning that it can&rsquo;t double as a blaster. An unfortunate choice, however seeing as Ezra&rsquo;s hilt would be unique to him I guess costs were an issue with this particular accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>

It is a fairly simple build to follow and doesn&rsquo;t really have much to be concerned over with exception to one step. Placing the small flagpole rods inside of the technic silver pieces, forgive me I&rsquo;m not familiar with the name, but it&rsquo;s the long piece that looks like a piece of a car engine also used for The Bat. Anyway getting the rods to slide effortlessly into the technic pieces can be frustrating, and I urge caution, as a full grown adult I was afraid of snapping the pieces in half rather than getting them situated inside. A lot more force was necessary considering I haven&rsquo;t had tolerance issues like this before when using these pieces.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Cold_fuzion","2015-05-25T19:08:05.333Z","High speed pursuit and the missing pink helmet","<p>This set was bought as part of my quest to get the entire crew from Rebels and this was the least expensive route to get Sabine Wren.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Yeah, it&#39;s a box.</p>

<p>The instructions where clear enough I was able to pop this together in about ten minutes while most of my attention was focused on watching the Clone Wars.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t normally look to sets in this price point for fun/unusual parts, but this one has a few. The printed dome and decent variety of dark green parts were a pleasant surprise.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Stormtrooper: I&#39;m not really one for knowing the exact differences between the various troopers, so I can&#39;t really tell you how different he is from the 11,000 other troopers you might already have. I will say the figure does a very good job of conveying a general Stormtrooper vibe and I guess that&#39;s good?</p>

<p>Ezra Bridger: Ezra feels a little off. I think it&#39;s the hair color. I do love the creativity of using the binocular piece for his rather unconventional lightsabre. Brilliant move.</p>

<p>Sabine Wren: The hair is perfect as are the legs and blasters. I have no real issues with the face either, but the torso bugs me. The armor is too dark and red instead of pink. I was also very sad to find her pink helmet also does not make an appearance. I also think she could use arm-printing for the shoulder armor as she seems a little incomplete without it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty simple and repetitive build (even if the bikes are slightly different for some reason), but I&#39;m not sure what else one would expect from looking at this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The speeder bikes are actually pretty cool. I was on the fence on whether to even bother building them, but I&#39;m glad I did. They&#39;re surprisingly sturdy and very swooshable. I did not, however, bother with the stud launchers. I believe the speeders will find a home in my permanent layout (whenever that comes to be).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great little set, but suffers too much from the Star Wars Tax, IMO. This should be a few dollars cheaper than it is. The lack of Sabine&#39;s helmet was also the cause of sadness, but I do not regret the purchase at all.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2018-12-23T23:29:52.38Z","Great Speeder Bikes","<p>I was really excited for this set to add to my Rebels collection. This is also the first set that&nbsp;Sabine Wren came in.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instruction Manual:</strong></p>

<p>The box for this set was normal size for a set of this price. The dimensions of the box are 26.2 x14.1 x 6.1 cm and weighs 0.57 lbs. The size of the instruction manual is the normal size for the set as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There are a few special parts in this set. You get some dark green pieces which were nice. Also the dark green dish with the orange printing on it was pretty cool piece to get as well.&nbsp;The blasters used for Sabine were a nice touch as they aren&#39;t as common. The total piece count for this set is 253</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>In this set you get three figures:&nbsp;Ezra Bridger, Sabine Wren, and a Stormtrooper.</p>

<p><strong>Ezra:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Ezra comes with a lightsaber. Personally I would have liked something better than a light grey binocular&nbsp;piece for his lightsaber&nbsp;hilt. I have since added a normal lightsaber hilt (For me it is better than the grey binocular piece).&nbsp;He has a double sided head. I&#39;m not a big fan of his face (as it doesn&#39;t really resemble his face from the show, but that may just be me).&nbsp;The detail on Ezra is okay. He has a tan jacket with an orange shirt under it. Some minor printing on the legs&nbsp;as well. The bird symbol on the back of his jacket was a very nice touch.</p>

<p><strong>Sabine:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Sabine comes with two blasters. Also has a doubled sided head.&nbsp;Her hair piece is really cool with the colors. It is a nice resemblance to her hair on the show. The printing on her body and legs are really good as well.&nbsp;This is also her first appearance in any Lego&nbsp;set. My only problem is that they didn&#39;t give her, her helmet. I did later go and buy it because it is so iconic with her. Also instead of bear arms, I would have rather had her armor on her arms instead. Other than that they did a good job on her.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Stormtrooper:</strong></p>

<p>The Stormtrooper is unique in that it is different from the traditional stormtroopers. The blue markings on the side of helmet show that. Also the mouth printing on the helmet is more compressed than the original stormtroopers.&nbsp;Besides that pretty much the same with the printing on the body and legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build was fairly easy took me around 15&nbsp;minutes to build. The set comes with half a dozen stickers. The speeder bikes are exactly the same in build just different colors.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I was finished with it I was very happy with my purchase. Watching the show it was nice to get Sabine and Ezra. The speeder bikes are some of the best I have every seen Lego make. My only problem is the handles they use cannot be reach by the Minifigures (I ended up switching them out with levers so the Minifigures can reach them). Also not a big fan of the stud shooters.&nbsp;They just kind of look weird just&nbsp;sticking out the side of the bike.&nbsp;Other than that they are amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a very good set not only for the figures but also for the speeder bikes. Also getting Sabine for the first time. The figures are great. The bikes are just awesome. I love them. I just wish they would have gave Sabine her helmet. They are some of the best speeder bikes I have ever seen or owned. Overall I&#39;m&nbsp;giving&nbsp;it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Nuruodo","2016-01-02T22:39:23.197Z","Fighting in the streets of Lothal","<p>I bought this set before Christmas, mostly due to its minifigures, I&#39;ve to say. Speeder bikes were nice, but I do wanted to get Sabine (and I didn&#39;t have money to buy the Imperial Carrier). Now that I built it, I think it was worth the price and it&#39;s a nice set, also for the speeders.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small as the ones of the same range sets. On the front&nbsp;there are the bikes about to collide while Sabine shoots at the trooper; on the back there are a nice cartoon (usually we only find play features on the back) and some play features. Instructions were written in only one book, pretty small, and they were easy to be followed.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts were divided in two bags, one for each speeder. For both parts are basically the same, with only color changing. To create the extensible tip some Technic bricks are used. In the rest of the set there isn&#39;t much to say, just that many rounded parts are used.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are what makes this set desiderable, in my opinion. We find Ezra, Sabine and a Stormtrooper. The trooper is like all the ones we find in &quot;Rebels&quot; inspired sets, with light blue signs on the helmet. Ezra is armed with a particular lightsaber, with a binocular instead of the usual hilt: this because of its special saber that has a blaster-equipped hilt. I liked the way Lego tried to imitate it. Sabine is very nice, I love it! She is equipped with two pistols similar to the ones given to some Clone trooper Captains and Commanders in older &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; sets: you will notice that the sight is practically absent on them. The figure is nice and well done; it&#39;s very precious because this is the only set, together with 75106 Imperial Carrier, in which you can find her.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very very fast. Once you create the first speeder, the second one can be built with closed eyes. However it was a nice build, I can&#39;t say I didn&#39;t have fun. Maybe just because they were identical it was funnier!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed models are nice and very loyal to the original ones. They are big, I&#39;ve to say &quot;huge&quot; compared to the figures. But also in &quot;Rebels&quot; these speeders always seemed to me a bit too big. However, Lego decided to make them very detailed, so their size is justified. Stud-shooters aren&#39;t too in sight (as always, I&#39;d prefer Lego sets without them).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a nice set, with good minifigures (you get Sabine!) and funny models. It isn&#39;t a great set, but if you like &quot;Rebels&quot; (like me) and you want to recreate Lothal, this is a very desiderable set. It&#39;s price is low, and so the piece-for-piece is, so I don&#39;t see any reason you shouldn&#39;t buy it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Low price</p>

<p>&ndash; Nice minifigures (Sabine!)</p>

<p>&ndash; Good playability&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Repetitive build</p>

<p>&ndash; Very very big speeders</p>
