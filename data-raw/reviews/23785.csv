"Mymaker_Rex","2015-01-03T23:47:24.533Z","Nice walker, nice figures.","<p>This is probably going to be the only time I&#39;ll be fine with a set being non-canon and completely inaccurate. Why? Read ahead and find out...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like all boxes in this new wave, I&#39;m not particularly blown away. There&#39;s the action shots, product info, and a new Disney logo. I barely notice the box, I&#39;m tearing into it before I examine it, funnily enough.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This being a clone walker, there will be a variety of light and dark bluish grey pieces, but also included are some nice dark orange slopes and tiles, which may be useful for those doing a desert themed MOC.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Ah, the controversy behind these figures. On one hand, they are completely inaccurate. Phase 2 clones never landed on Geonosis, and certainly didn&#39;t have this camouflage. On the other hand, the printing is absolutely incredible. The camouflage is beyond belief and contrasts perfectly with the medium orange colour. The new &quot;grinning clone&quot; face is also nice for the Airborne Troopers.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A simple and quick build, not much effort, although the multi-stud shooter might be difficult to set up for a younger audience (5-10 years perhaps). For TFOLs and AFOLs, I doubt any issues shall be present.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The walker is a nice design, triggering nostalgia from the Clone Trooper Battle Pack from 2009. The stud blasters fit to the back and can be used by a rear gunner, but the main playability feature is the new rapid-stud shooter, which fires 6 studs by turning a rod on the walker&#39;s back, a feature which I&#39;m sure will be much loved by kids and teens ( I should know, I am one ).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a nice set. Unless you are making a Geonosis MOC, there&#39;s really no reason to buy multiple of these, but at least get one, just to see the quality of those printed troopers, and have some fun with that new stud shooter.</p>

"Charlot2106","2015-07-09T16:31:37.057Z","Awsome minifigures for collectors! ","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>First of all, the box demonstrates the product accurately while being&nbsp;interesting and the instructions are very clear and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As for the different parts of the set, I liked how as a battle pack, this set still includes over a hundred pieces.&nbsp;Also, the Geonosis&nbsp;Clone Troopers has&nbsp;an awesome&nbsp;new design with their brownish-orange color with camouflage prints on the helmet, torso, hips and legs. But in my opinion, the best part of this set are the new blasters and the rotation gun located on the Clone Trooper Walker. At first, I thought that the blasters would be cheap and would shoot up to about 5 to 10 cm (1 to 2 inches), just like all lego&nbsp;(springfree)&nbsp;canons, but it ended up being very effective and shooting up to 2 meters (8ft) ! Finally, I loved how many pieces were unique to this set and how they all fited&nbsp;into a nice, sweet looking battle pack.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As I said before, the minifigures are unique, innovative and easy to fit with other sets such as &quot;Battle for Geonosis&quot; or the &quot;Clone Turbo Tank&quot; to make awesome fighting scenes on your shelves. A great investment&nbsp;to fulfill&nbsp;my clone troopers&#39; collection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The building process, I&#39;d say was the one of the most interesting of all battle packs I&#39;ve had. Contrarily to other packs such as the &quot;Mandolorian&nbsp;Battle Pack&quot; or the &quot;Clone Troopers Battle Pack&quot;, this one features EFFECTIVE shooting system with the brand new rotating mini gun, which gives a unique and special point to this Lego set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great despite its simple look. Honestly, I originally&nbsp;bought this set for the cool minifigures&nbsp;but ended up with a sweet vehicle as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In conclusion, I think this is the best battle pack I&#39;ve bought so far and I would give it a 9 or a 10 out of 10. I recommend it for anyone with a minifigure&nbsp;collection or simply someone who desires to play or make battle scenes.&nbsp;</p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2016-07-24T05:12:28.06Z","A desert-camo mixed bag","<p>I like battle packs, especially well-done ones. They&#39;re an inexpensive way to increase one&#39;s armies of various factions. The 2014 and 2015 packs featuring Clone Troopers grabbed my interest when I was getting back into collecting (still after Kashyyk Troopers plus duplicates), especially after I received the 2013 Republic Gunship set as a birthday present. And I just so happened to have received a Toys&#39;R&#39;Us gift card with enough money to buy two battle packs, so off I went. I had previously purchased Utapau Troopers, and it had whet my appetite. For a while I debated which two to get (the considered choices being: a second Utapau Troopers set, Kashyyk Troopers, Geonosis Troopers, and Senate Commandos). I ultimately went with this and Senate Commandos.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small, as it should be for a set like this, and depicts the included troopers battling offscreen foes. The instructions are short and unambiguous, though be patient with them all the same - being folded up like a pocket roadmap can make them springy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set includes some ratcheting hinges, some angled plates, cheese slopes, curved slopes, an antenna, four of the stud-firing blasters, one of the new-for-2015 gatling cannons (and its associated rods), and plenty of dark blue studs to load them with. The stud blasters are a piece introduced in 2014, and come in two parts: the main body of the blaster, and its trigger. A stud is loaded into the muzzle, and the force required to make the trigger pop it off sends it flying an appreciable distance. Fired right, they can knock down an unanchored minifigure. In short, while cartoonish looking and in some ways not as storage-friendly as the non-firing blaster guns they&#39;re what many of us (myself included) dreamed of as kids - Lego Star Wars blasters that could really fire. The gatling cannon works similarly; in its case, a rotating wiper cranked via Technic parts is used to launch the studs. One final part of note is a 2x2 top section for 1x2 friction hinge bricks... and the absence of such a hinge brick to go with it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set includes two standard Phase II clone troopers in dark desert camouflage armor, and two Phase II Airborne clone troopers in the same. Essentially, Phase II troopers in the camo seen in the Second Battle of Geonosis from the Clone Wars cartoon. The regular troopers, as expected, use the modern printed-visor version of the Phase II helmet (which for those unfamiliar with it is a marked improvement on the original version from Episode III - that one is slightly misshapen and entirely too bulky, and the attempt at giving the visor some depth by making the &quot;lenses&quot; section a cutout is partly to blame). The Airborne troopers (helmets designed for ops high up where the atmosphere is thin) have skirts made from Lego&#39;s rough, papery cloth, which are preferable to the molded skirts from certain Clone Wars sets (since they don&#39;t block leg movement).</p>

<p>There are a couple of disappointments for me here. One is the inclusion of two Airborne troopers - I would have preferred a third regular clone trooper instead of two specials, or perhaps a Clone Scout Trooper since most of the Phase I troopers seen in Geonosis-camo in the show were wearing Scout-type helmets. But really, with the exception of the Kashyyk Troopers pack (most of the troopers seen on Kashyyk are also wearing Scout Trooper helmets). I would prefer these packs to have been either 4 regulars or 3 regulars, 1 special. The other disappointment is Lego&#39;s continued use of the &quot;white people&quot; skin tone for Clone Troopers. This whitewashing has been going on ever since Lego started doing Clone Troopers with faces - it has to stop! This continued screwup is what dropped the parts rating down to a 1.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As expected, the build is very straightforward and simple. The walker goes together in a jiffy, and comes out reasonably solid. Control detail at is small size is provided in an interesting manner: the use of the 2x2 top section for friction-hinge bricks. This also acts as a stop that keeps the sides of the cowling from closing in too far. Perhaps the most interesting/complex part is assembling the rigging for the gatling cannon and its control rod.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a smaller-scaled (not as small as the one from the Clone Wars Turbo Tank set, but not as outsize as the more detailed AT-RT sets) two-seater version of the AT-RT with an enormous gatling gun slung under the normal main gun. The gatling gun is worked by one of the modern-type axle splacers. Not the easiest to grip, but certainly not the hardest. The gun is at a good height for hitting minifigures, which is good for playability. The walker itself comfortably seats two and has clips for their guns near the saddlebags. It&#39;s a bit tight and looks a bit silly, but one can also stand the other two figs on the hips.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Fairly satisfied with this one. My main complaints are the continued whitewashing of the Clone Troopers and the inclusion of two Airborne troopers instead of a third regular trooper. Otherwise, it&#39;s a solid set. The AT-RT is a worthwhile model, whether you leave the Gatling cannon on or not, though it can also yield useful parts if broken up. Personally I plan on keeping mine built (though minus the gun), and rotating some of my Episode III clones out to crew it (unless I can get or -heh- clone additional new style helmets for them, they&#39;re sadly a bit of a hassle to fit in crowded transports). Well worth getting, might still be on the shelves at your local stores.</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-10-09T01:16:47.71Z","Deja vu... wait a minute, what is this thing even from?!","<p>Hello, reader who cares enough to read this! I&#39;m PicnicBasketSam, and today I&#39;m reviewing yet another very small set. Today it&#39;s a Star Wars battlepack, not my usual fare, but it&#39;s still small and packed with potential. Anyways, Geonosis Troopers features a custom clone walker and four Episode III clones, decked out in an orangey camo color. Frankly, it wouldn&#39;t be very helpful in combat to have the same color scheme as all of the other side&#39;s troops and the terrain, but whatever. Side note, this set is not actually based off of anything; in the Clone Wars cartoon, the fighting on Geonosis is over well before these armor was used, and that walker might possibly be an AT-RT. It&#39;s a bit hard to tell, but the armor plating, antenna, and guns make it seem like that, although... the gatling gun makes me think it&#39;s just something the designer came up with for fun.</p>

<p>Anyways, on with the set. The box is rather small, featuring the gatling gun action, clones shooting at an unseen target, and lots of reddish sand. The contents are 2 small bags containing about 100 parts, instructions, and no stickers at all! Yay!</p>

<p>The instructions are not particularly noteworthy.</p>

<p>The build is quick, unrepetitive, and reminds me of a certain other clone walker. Nice.</p>

<p>The minifigs are in pairs: Two normal Phase 2 clones, and two airborne clones. They have no jetpacks, skirts, special guns, or noteworthy things. Mainly, the difference is the helmet and the printed bandoleer.</p>

<p>The completed set is pretty sweet, actually. The walker looks threatening enough with that gun, and actually has moveable legs. It&#39;s very playable, although there&#39;s nothing for them to shoot at in a remotely similar price range. Aargh.</p>

<p>OVERALL OPINION<br />
I do like this set. It&#39;s simple enough, has very detailed minifigs, and is fun to play with. Not bad for $13.</p>

The shooting action is actually surprisingly good as well (never tried it out before). Also nice to get four mini-figs in such a small kit.</p>

<p>The desert camo troopers are awesome, but the walker really stands out. The legs are stable, the six-shooter doesn&#39;t look too out of place, and the head is actually a&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>cool design. All of it is just so&nbsp;<em>good</em>.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2020-02-09T21:48:28.207Z","Blast them Bugs!","<p>The geonosian trooper battle pack is AWESOME! The walker has the large stud shooter on the front which is kinda strange and makes the walker look like it is about to fall over, but adds to the playability. The stud shooters are not accurate, but they also add to the playability. The regular geonosian troopers look awesome but the airborne troopers are not seen on Genosis and i would have rather seen the desert camo ARF Troopers instead because we actually see those in the second battle of Genosis. Overall I would highly recommend buying this set seeing as it is so cool.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-12-29T14:31:46.077Z","Funny how these clones were essentially made up by Lego ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The Geonosis troopers battle pack is a pretty great one with fantastic Minifigures and a fun AT-RT build but these clone never existed in universe in film or television so I am curious where Lego got there inspiration .</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>The figures include two of each variation of clone starting with the regular phase two clone , his helmet in in light nugat and features camo printing , the heads are angry clone and the torso and legs are a light nugat and brown camo print , they both wield a stud shooter each , the Geonosis airborne trooper uses the airborne helmet from the 2014 212th troopers ( Utapau troopers) battle pack in light nugat with camo printing , the head is not angry clone it is neutral clone , his torso is similar to the others but has a strap and a shoulder pad and the legs are the same as the other two , they both wield a stud shooter each .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is a camouflage themed AT-RT ( all terrain recon transport ) , the feet use 1&times;4 dark grey slopes and 1&times;1 dark orange cheese slopes , there are hinge bricks used for the legs already has a grille slope on it , the base of the head is built on a 2&times;6 black plate and underneath is a fairly complex technic mechanism for a 6 stud shooter which can be twisted and you can then lose six 1&times;1 dark trans blue studs in rapid succession , the head uses a hinge attachment with slopes and angled plates to get the shape , there is a four stud space for a pilot , a back rest and finally a passenger seat with another four studs for a figure and a clip for a stud shooter and a large black antenna at the very back .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good battle pack , I just wonder where Lego got there inspiration from , this definitely is not in Revenge of the Sith (2005) and from someone who has watched the amazing clone was series a multitude of times this never appears there , however&nbsp; still recommend this very good but mysterious battle pack .&nbsp;</p>

"TheBrickDudeStudios","2020-07-09T12:25:06.167Z","Not the best battle pack","<h2>Builds</h2>

<p>This set comes with only one build And I think it is an AT-RT.</p>

<h3>AT-RT</h3>

<p>The easiest thing to spot on the AT-RT&nbsp;is the big stud blaster at the front. It is fine for playability but it is not that good if you are going to use it in a battle. There is space to put two minifigs on top.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>This set comes with four minifigs and they are two airborne troopers and two regular clone troopers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Airborne troopers.</h3>

<p>The airborne troopers have a cool helmet that is different from the regular clone troopers.&nbsp;They have a different print on the body. They have the same legs as the regular clone troopers.</p>

<h3>Regular clone troopers</h3>

<p>The regular clones have a normal phase two helmets on but a different color and print. They have a defferint body than the airborne troopers. They have the same legs as the airborne troopers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>My opinions</h2>

<p>This is a good set even though this is not cannon, but I am fine with that. Why do they always use stud shooters? That is the thing I do not like about battle packs. But still this is a good set.</p>
