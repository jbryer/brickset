<p>The set uses some interesting parts, definitely could be used for other creations.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I originally wasn&#39;t huge on these minifigures, as I would rather have a set than minifigures, but boy are these awesome! I always love extra&nbsp;stormies, the AT-DP pilots are excellent, and Agent Callus is quite brilliantly designed. Excellent minifigures, a perfect selection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You have to really pay attention to the build if you want the set to come out right. That&#39;s just stating the obvious. The build was extremely satisfying, you getto learn a lot about newer designs, how older pieces are used in new sets like this one, overall exactly what you would want from a build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The overall model looks so much like the later used AT-ST, that it&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s got the crooked legs feel, the head slightly bent down, you can pose one minifigure up top with the opening hatch, while the pilots drive the walker inside.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is an excellent lego set. The one problem I think to encounter is the fact that this set is more for posing than playing. The legs can barely move in the correct manner, but keep in mind that children would love to shoot things regardless with those spring loaded shooters. Overall excellent set released by LEGO.&nbsp;</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-10-09T22:18:09.407Z","Walker just from Rebels","<p>The AT-DP is a walker featured in the TV series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;, and its Lego set, in my opinion, is very similar to it. I like it very much, and I&#39;m happy because it was surely worth the price I payied.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is big and the instructions were good, except the part regarding the legs: I had problems with the first one, which&nbsp;couldn&#39;t assume the right position.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has a lot of dome-shaped and long parts. For the legs were used Technician pieces. The gun is very well done, with the new couple of parts that I also found in the droid gunship.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set includes a Rebels stormtrooper; two AT-DP Pilots, that got&nbsp;a &quot;strange&quot; armor and a strange helmet; Agent Kallus, with his bo-rifle and his particular helmet.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I didn&#39;t really enjoy building the set. I had problems, as I said, with the legs. But the cockpit was very&nbsp;funny to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is pretty impressive. It&#39;s very tall, and the cockpit can be opened in two ways, making it so nice to &quot;use&quot;. Also the gun is well done, because it can rotate very much.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A really good set that I&#39;ll suggest to everyone. I didn&#39;t expect so much when I bought it, and instead of a simple copy of Rebels&#39; walker I found one of the best &quot;Star Wars&quot; walkers. The Lego version could appear better than the TV one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; High detailed and accured cockpit and cannon</p>

<p>&ndash; Nice minifigures from <em>Star Wars Rebels</em>, Agent Kallus with his helmet</p>

<p>&ndash; In my opinion it&rsquo;s worth the price, and maybe a bit low priced</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Yellow parts not featured in the original model</p>

<p>&ndash; Legs can have a very reduced movement</p>

"KarolWes","2019-03-23T17:02:20.38Z","AT-ST bigger brother","<p>For a long time I wanted to get this set. Mostly because of the Agent Callus minifig&nbsp;and because I didn&#39;t had any other walker from Star Wars. So this set was my choice to fill this gap in my collection.</p>

<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>

<p>Model itself looks pretty cool. It&#39;s very high, and very stable. At the front has a big chin canon, which looks great and can be moved all around. It&#39;s mostly one-colored, done in LBG, with some additions in DBG and very few in yellow. Panel, which makes head are done well. There are attached at a special angle, leaning to the front. Dome parts on this panels looks like eyes, which adds this craft some what of a danger animal look. Top hatch, as well as whole top panel can be open. Hatch is designed perfectly and allows you to put a minifig&nbsp;half-inside which looks adorable.</p>

<p>Inside the canopy there are two very simple seats with consoles, very simple as well, just plain trans-red tile. You can put inside two pilots. there isn&#39;t any dedicated place to put pilots&#39; blasters, but in canopy there is enough space to keep them with guns.</p>

<p>Legs are made mostly from technic bricks and liftarms&nbsp;with use of many pins. There are one interesting&nbsp;technic in building this legs. To strengthen&nbsp;the construction there are used pins with bar (this from flip-fire missiles) and it&#39;s bar is attached into a small pin. It makes the model really sturdy, but process of building, and even more destroying, is so hard. This technic is used five times on each leg, if I remember correctly. So it fine idea, but realization is painful.</p>

<p>On the legs there are some small disk used as a decorations, and also some stickers. In fact there aren&#39;t many greebling&nbsp;which is quite sad given the size of this vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Play function</strong></p>

<p>Main function of this model is that you can shoot by rotating a head. It looks fine and work great, but when you treat this as a display model then it is very inconvenient. I prefer to keep it without loaded missiles. Apart that you can move main canon and play with the figures inside the canopy. Also legs have a little of posability&nbsp;but it is just one or two &quot;points&quot; on the ratchet joint (despite how you attached feet).</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are 500 parts in this set. Many of them are very common, but there are some nice one. We get in here many technic elements (mostly pins, but also some liftarms), technic bricks in various length, and many disks: 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 6x6, round plates, big ball joint&nbsp;used as a base for a cannon and big ratchet joint.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>We get four minifigs&nbsp;in here</p>

<ul>
	<li>Agent Callus - very important character in Rebel series. He is done great. He has a black suit with some kind of metal chest plate on a torso. It is very detailed, has even an imperial insignia and rank. Helmet is a special mold and appears in only one other set. It&#39;s black with silver front. Legs are plain. Head has double sided face one calm, one angry with nicely printed eyebrows and facial hair. He is equipped in long&nbsp;Bo-rifle. Only missing thing is imperial emblem that should be printed on arms.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>AT-DP pilot - we get two exactly the same figs. Printed very well. Has some small, pocket-like&nbsp;prints on legs and hips, great belt and vest. On helmet there are small Imperial insignia an mark in form of three red triangles. As a face he has print of part of his mask, which looks okay, nothing too fancy. It&#39;s rather unique minifig&nbsp;appearing only in one other set, but he looks similar to imperial combat driver (he has the same prints, but on gray parts). Pilots are equipped with small blasters.</li>

	<li>Last guy in this set is Stormtrooper in rebel version. Nothing special, ordinary minifig, but makes very well. There are minor differences between him and classic version of trooper. I especially like small blue stripes on a helmet. He has standard blaster.</li>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Set looks great, but could have more fancy details - some pipes, wires or something.</li>
	<li>Interior is very neat and doesn&#39;t need anything more.</li>
	<li>Playability of this set is close to zero. Mostly it&#39;s a display set, but has a very annoying shooting function.</li>
	<li>Parts are great, a few stickers, many technic parts.</li>
	<li>Minifigs are great, especially agent Callus, but they can add a wig pieces for him. Two exactly the same pilots are fine, and help you make a full crew of craft.</li>
	<li>Stormtrooper&nbsp;is nice addition to whole set</li>
	<li>For this price there could be one more fig for example one of good guys.</li>
	<li>Price is good.</li>
