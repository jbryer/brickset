"kr_lik","2014-12-29T10:24:43.583Z","Quite nice set.","<p>I bought this set in a polish SMYK store yesterday (so a bit earlier than it was supposed to be out). I overpayed for it quite a lot but then again that&#39;s what &quot;impulse-purchase&quot; is all about :)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box itself is quite nice. Not too big, not too small. Instructions are easy to read and pretty standard. There&#39;s a small sticker sheet as well, consisting of 6 small stickers.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 355 parts in this set. They&#39;re all pretty standard ranging from light-gray to dark-gray and black. Some red transparent bricks are also present. I think this set has a new part -&gt; (sorry for being an ignorant) an L-shaped light-gray brick with no studs. You can see it on the stock pictures on &quot;top&quot; of the wings (I think it&#39;s called a &quot;tile&quot; ;] ). Other than that - the printed domes are also interesting pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figs are basically what should draw you to this set. The Inquisitor is AMAZING. It has a new helmet, shoulder-pads and a lightsaber. This fig is pure awesome. It&#39;s definitely a must for all the SW minifig collectors out there. You also get a TIE Pilot (I think it&#39;s a new fig as well - different helmet from the last TIE Fighter Pilot we had) and an Imperial Officer (which also has &quot;new&quot; tag on the box meaning it&#39;s an exclusive!. Pure Empire gold!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is devided to 3 stages. Bag 1 - Cockpit. Bag 2 - &quot;Wing-holders&quot;. Bag 3 - Wings. The build is rather fast and a bit repetetive as the wing-holders are basically a mirrored versions of each other and the wings are a build of x4 of the same thing.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks rather good. It has a flicker-cannons (?), it opens the glass dome and the top dome so you can put a minifig inside. The only issue I have with this model is the size of it comparing it to the last TIE Fighter. But then again when I look at -&gt; http://www.theforce.net/swtc/Pix/books/weg/trenchtie.jpg &lt;- it MIGHT actually be the right size.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The model is nothing extraordinary. It&#39;s a standard TIE set and it will look good with the other TIEs in your collection. The minifigs tho are a MUST!</p>

"donutsftw","2015-01-31T00:46:32.27Z","Good but not quite great","<p>This TIE variant comes to us courtesy of the Rebels TV series. Apparently it&#39;s a TIE Advanced prototype. I thought the TIE Advanced was already a prototype... So is this a prototype of a prototype? Whatever, it still looks cool.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Do you like grey? Because if you do, you&#39;re in for a treat. There&#39;s 8 L-shaped tiles in light grey, which are still pretty uncommon. There&#39;s also the new 6x6 disks with bars used in the cockpit: one in trans-black and one in light grey. Both are printed and look like they&#39;d have all sorts of neat applications outside this set. There&#39;s 2 printed 2x2 round tiles on the wings, which look like they have the same print as the ones in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9492-1/TIE-Fighter"">9492 TIE Fighter</a>, the only difference seems to be the ones in this set are the re-designed ones with an O on the bottom instead of an X.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>At this point, I&#39;ve got so many different TIE pilots, so I can&#39;t say whether this particular one is a new print. Annoyingly, he&#39;s got a generic fleshie head, which is clearly visible because the pilot helmets don&#39;t cover the back of the head. Why Lego didn&#39;t use one of the black body-glove style heads like they used to I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>The Imperial officer is new (and exclusive) to this set, though he&#39;s fairly plain. He&#39;s got front and back torso printing, and a new face with slightly sunken eyes. It&#39;s a nice level of detail without going overboard. His hat is also a new mold and has some nice little printed details.</p>

<p>The Inquisitor is clearly the stand-out minifig here. He&#39;s got front and back torso and leg printing, and his armor is a new mold with some printed details on the torso and shoulders. It also has a clip on back to hold his lightsaber. Speaking of which, his lightsaber handle is a new piece: It&#39;s molded in dark pearl grey and unlike the normal lightsaber handles is symmetrical. His helmet is also pretty cool: Its trans-red visor is molded into the helmet. The only problem is that he looks bizarrely misshapen with both the helmet and armor on. With both them on, his head and shoulders look way too big for his body.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There&#39;s not much to say about the build: It&#39;s pretty simple, with only minimal SNOT. The wings are repetitive, but at least they&#39;re not too big. There&#39;s a few small stickers, but ship still looks okay without them since they&#39;re not in areas immediately visible from the front.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice spaceship... It&#39;s just it doesn&#39;t exactly seem like a TIE fighter. The wing panels look too chunky, in addition to not being black like every other TIE fighter ever. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s very accurate to the show though. The ship is nice and sturdy and very swooshable, and has one neat play feature: By twisting the hexagonal panel on the back of the fighter left or right, you can fire the &quot;lasers&quot;.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Unless you&#39;re a big fan of the Rebels show, you can probably pass on this set. It does make a great parts pack, but at 40 USD the price per part is a little high.</p>

"James_Bucky_Barnes","2016-08-19T14:39:00.917Z","Good but overpriced ","<p>This is part 2 of my rebel review series, part one is a review of the imperial troop transport.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is standard size for a &pound;40 set and the instructions were easy to follow</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only special parts are the windscreen and the cockpit hatch.</p>

<p>there are some useful gray and dark grey parts</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure selection is good mostly because of the inquisitor.</p>

<p>The Inquisitor:this is the main draw of the set. He is made of all new parts.He has a brand new head, an exclusive armour piece, a rare lightsaber hilt and an exclusive helmet.</p>

<p>His army make him slightly taller than other minifigures like pau&#39;ans. This is a nice touch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Imperial officer Aresko: this guy is not exclusive as he also appears in imperial assault carrier(review coming next week).He has a nice detailed head with bags under his eyes. My only complaint is that the dark tan uniform doesn&#39;t fit in with the other imperial officers</p>

<p>Tie pilot: At first this guy looks like the old tie pilot from the Original Trilogy, but look closer, he has a brand new print. He has know detailing on his legs but has no gray hands making him look more menacing. However the new tie pilot &nbsp;helmet leaves some of the flesh head visible ruining the all black look. I suggest swapping the angry clone head for a black head.</p>

<p>THE COMPLETED MODEL&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the completed model is good. It has a detailed cockpit and the spring loaded blasters don&#39;t take away from the look of the model. The are activated by turning a knob on the back of the model. It is a very clever feature. The wing fold up for landing mode.</p>

<p>However I think they should have included a rebel figure to increase play value. Maybe Zeb because he is only in one set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OVERALL THOUGHTS</p>

<p>Overall I think this is a very good set but is overpriced. If you see this on sale I highly recommend picking one up if you are a fan of rebels. It include the main antagonist of the series, the Inquisitor &nbsp;</p>

<p>Up next is the speeder bike chase!</p>

"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2020-04-21T05:07:24.35Z","Very Underated!","<p>Now Star Wars Rebels isn&rsquo;t my favourite TV show of&nbsp;all time, although I still enjoyed a lot of it. I got this set during my dark age, mostly just for the&nbsp;Inquisitor minifigure, who I thought looked excellent. However, does he still hold up? Is he the only good part of this set?</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Three minifigures are included:</p>

<p>The Inquisitor is, quite simply, the main draw of the set. He is very detailed and quite accurate to the source material. I especially like his armour piece, which is both detailed and can hold his special lightsaber on the back. The only downside is that his saber&nbsp;can&rsquo;t spin. Shame.</p>

<p>The Imperial Officer is also an interesting figure. While Brickset lists him as Cumberland Aresko, I should point out he&rsquo;s&nbsp;listed as Imperial Officer&nbsp;on the box. He also bears some resemblance to Yogar Lyste. Besides this, the tan uniform is&nbsp;not too bad and he is satisfying enough.</p>

<p>A Tie Pilot is also included. His identity could possibly Valon&nbsp;Rudor, but I can&rsquo;t prove this for sure. Nothing really stands out on the figure except for the helmet style which is similar to Stormtroopers in other Rebels sets. I&rsquo;m personally not a fan of this.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The design for the Tie Advanced is really neat. Many curved parts are used around the hull to great effect at capturing the sleekness of the ship. The cockpit is also quite comfortable. So, overall, the look of this ship is excellent.</p>

<p>As for playability, the ship has two main features. The first is the closing wings, while the second has a firing mechanism activated from the rear. However, both of these aren&rsquo;t anything special.</p>

<p><strong>Other:</strong></p>

<p>The price of this set was $60 AUD. Not bad for a very detailed ship and 350 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>This set is excellent. For a start, The Inquisitor is a very detailed figure and the other two are nice to get. However, top prize goes to the excellent and highly detailed ship build. In addition, the $60 price tag isn&rsquo;t bad for a LEGO TIE Fighter, when most of them are about $100. Great for fans on a budget.</p>

<p>So, is this a forgotten gem? Very clearly, yes! I highly recommend looking for it on Bricklink or eBay.</p>
