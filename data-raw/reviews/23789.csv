<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the new high quality packaging that I mentioned in the review of Anakin&#39;s Custom Starfighter, except this time around there was plenty of room for the bags, and the instructions were the flattest I have ever seen them. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;A majority of the parts in this set are &quot;Brick yellow&quot; and &quot;Sand yellow&quot; colored (the former looks tan and the latter looks dark tan, how they are yellow is beyond me), and most of these parts are curved pieces that were used to capture the unique look of the AAT. &nbsp;I could see these pieces easily being used in a Tatooine MOC, so this&nbsp;is an ideal scavenger set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Unlike most of the other sets released during this wave, NONE of the minifigures are new.</p>

<p>Jar Jar Binks looks exactly the same as he did in 7929 Battle of Naboo, and he still has his same old head mold that has existed for at least 15 years now. &nbsp;The printing is definitely an improvement, but I feel a rubber mold would allow for more flexible figure that would appeal to children more, but who likes Jar Jar anyway?</p>

<p>Battle Droid Pilots are a lot easier to come by than they used to, but it is always nice to add one to your ranks. &nbsp;Really just a regular Battle Droid with a blue torso and a sidearm instead of the usual blaster carbine.</p>

<p>The single Battle Droid included with this set is the same as they have always been, and in that case will not be elaborated on because I am positive that at least 90% of you own one. There really is no improvement to be had, unless an ingenious design was implemented that would allow for both legs to move separately!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was enjoyable, and took the expected amount of time of a $25 set. &nbsp;The only building technique that surprised me was the building of the engines (the piston looking things on the back), which went on in a way that allows for the correct angle to be achieved. Unlike most sets that contain them, the spring loaded launchers are hidden very neatly, and even have their own levers to fire them so you don&#39;t have anymore &quot;accidental discharges.&quot; &nbsp;There aren&#39;t any stickers in this set which may please some of you, but the very prominent launch tubes (the six holes on the front of the tank that launch missiles) are absent. &nbsp;A printed piece definitely would have been preferable, but I feel that two stickers to represent these launch tubes could have easily been done.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When compared to the source material, this model is relatively accurate. &nbsp;The play features are there, with the spring loaded launchers and the capability to hold both Battle Droids (One in the hull and one in the main turret). &nbsp;The angles and the color are also spot on, but there is one fatal flaw. &nbsp;It&#39;s too small. &nbsp;This was the main complaint from the get-go, and I have to say that it is correct. &nbsp;I felt that the arms that the side blasters were on were WAY too short, but upon looking at a photo of the one in Episode I, they are in perfect scale for the model&#39;s size. &nbsp;So why is this set so small? &nbsp;I have concluded that this set is small only because the MTT released during the summer was so small. &nbsp;This AAT is obviously meant to be a companion piece to 75058, or it would not be anywhere near this tiny. &nbsp;75058 MTT contains 954 pieces, while it&#39;s legendary predecessor 7662 contained a whopping 1330. &nbsp;If we had received an MTT that was the same size as 7662, I guarantee that this AAT would have been at least a $40 set and would have been much larger. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Although this set has it&#39;s flaws, it is still easily recognizable as the powerful war machine it was in Star Wars Battlefront. &nbsp;The curvature and greebling&nbsp;allow for a very accurate look, and it is in scale with itself. &nbsp;I recommend this set if you don&#39;t have an AAT yet, but if you own the original 7155, I suggest you keep that one safe, as this is probably the last AAT we are ever going to see due to the new Star Wars trilogy being released.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Great design</p>

<p>Very good price</p>

<p>Useful pieces</p>

<p>Cleverly hidden spring launchers</p>

<p>Flat instruction booklet</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>Way too small</p>

<p>No new minifigures</p>

<p>No stickers (a&nbsp;pro for some, but I honestly think they allow for better detail)</p>

<p>This is a great set for it&#39;s price, but it just isn&#39;t what I nor multiple other fans&nbsp;were looking for.</p>

<p>My next reviewed set will either be the Ghostbusters Ecto-1 or the AT-AP, so stick around!</p>

"KamKam628","2015-02-13T07:02:49.367Z","A nice reincarnation of the AAT","<p>I was looking for a new set to build my droid arsenal up a little and this was the perfect set for just that. But looking at the pictures of it, I thought it was&nbsp;too small. Here is what I now think&nbsp;of the newest version of the AAT (and only the 2nd from episode I).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has the new stormtrooper helmet&nbsp;logo, just as the other sets in the 2015 line. The instructions weren&#39;t really bent. It shows the play features, just like most other sets you see.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are just what you would expect from an episode I AAT. There are many nice curved pieces mostly in tan and some in a beige color. There are also some cool tan astromech bodies, but not sure what you&#39;d really use them for outside this set. It has many great pieces. I also got my first (and only so far) spring loaded launchers from this set. It also has a large light gray disc that fits on the spinny bottom part.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Almost every lego fan owns a battle droid or two so you probably know how they are. The pilot is the same, but with mostly blue body that has some tan printing. Jar-Jar has the same torso printing as he did in the Battle Of&nbsp;Naboo set. He also comes with one of the gungan shields that are also in the Battle Of Naboo set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fun and easy. It took me about 30 minutes to complete, and I thought I was building it pretty slowly myself. It has 3 sections of the build- the front/ hover part (I don&#39;t know what to call it), the middle section and the turret. The build is also symmetrical, but not really repetitive. It has some interesting parts to it, such as the turret and a little inside technic work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is great. At first I thought it was going to be too small, but it is actually pretty much to movie scale&nbsp;(don&#39;t quote me on this, as I haven&#39;t watched the movie in a while). It has a nice sleek design to it and looks great along with my other trade federation/ separatist machines. It is a very sturdy and good looking model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set surpassed all expectations. It has a great size and look (unlike the big clone wars hunk of junk, or the blocky 2000 version). It also has some nice good play features and it was definitely worth $25. I recommend this set to every lego&nbsp;Star Wars fan, not just separatist/trade federation&nbsp;sympathizers&nbsp;like myself.</p>

"Zrath","2015-02-23T09:00:16.85Z","Another chibi AAT? Isn't the Microfighters version enough?","<p>My first impression upon seeing the photos of this set was that the AAT was too chibi-looking. Chibi is a Japanese word for cutesified versions of things. It seems to have replaced the term &quot;super-deformed&quot;.</p>

<p>So yes, when compared to the original 7155 AAT from 2000 and the 8018 AAT (Clone Wars version) from 2009, this version is way smaller and oh-so-cute.</p>

<p>But I bought one anyway, because it&#39;s only $25 and it&#39;s tan! I like the original tan version of the AAT, as seen in Episode 1. I own two of the 7155 version.</p>

<p>The build is enjoyable, especially the turret. I like the design of the hinge for the turret hatch. It&#39;s all very clever. The part selection is nice, lots of tan with some dark tan thrown in. I&#39;m planning to eventually build some Ancient Egyptian dioramas, so I&#39;m always looking for cool tan parts.</p>

<p>The play features are cool. The twin missile launchers on the underside are fun. The hatches fit well over their openings and open easily. I do wish the turret rotation was clicky though, instead of being free-spinning.</p>

<p>Minifigure-wise, the pilot droid and battledroid are appropriate to the set. I like that the pilot droid has the smaller blaster &quot;pistol&quot;. I was hoping for a normal Gungan warrior but it&#39;s Jar-Jar Binks again instead. An extra Gungan would have been nice.</p>

<p>Overall, I like a lot of things about this set, but it is a not-very-good representation of the AAT. It&#39;s like the cartoon version of an AAT, like it should squash and stretch as it&#39;s being driven on the Naboo battlefields while battledroids and Gungans whack each other with giant mallets. It&#39;s a great parts pack though!</p>

"JerdaFoks","2015-11-13T13:58:31.513Z","The Pretentious Notion That Is Proper Scale","<p>Oh Star Wars... Even if I didn&#39;t adore that galaxy far, far away, as a Lego fan there is something of a duty to pay homage to Star Wars. The franchise was the first license acquired by TLG, and I firmly feel that it can be given most of the credit for launching Legos from &#39;that quirky European toy with the yellow people&#39; to a god of the household toy chest. So in complete opposition to the sentence I just penned, we have a more humble (and likely divisive) set that I found quaint from the moment I picked up the box until I swept up the spare parts: the third iteration of the AAT.</p>

<p>For those unaware (and also because it makes for a more cohesive transition between paragraphs), the AAT, or Armored Assault Tank, made its debut in the generally accepted debacle of a film Episode I: The Phantom Menace. But gungans and midi-chlorians aside, the film had a strong set of vehicle design with clear factions very reminiscent of the classic trilogy. This Star Wars-esque methodology for visual storytelling carried through best in the first generation tank: better than the MTT and droid starfighter from the same era anyway. The tank failed to make appearances in the next two films, instead finding a very welcoming home in other mediums, most notably the Clone Wars show from whence Lego&#39;s second generation AAT sprang.</p>

<p>This third version returns to the original color scheme, but is easily the smallest (full size anyway). This drastic reduction in size originally had me persuaded to not spend my money on the set, as I was more than aware of how&nbsp;<em>right</em>&nbsp;the scale of the second gen tank felt since my brother owned it. But as these things often happen, I purchased it a little while later as a small aside with some other mid-range sets. And funnily enough, of all the parts assembled that evening, this admittedly half-size tank was the most satisfying.</p>

<p>This satisfaction comes not from the pieces nor the build itself. The turret spins, the cannon and pilot hatches are hinged, and the missiles can fire (the mechanism for which is simple but amused me as time was taken to create one where for many larger sets the rods are just left to hang in the open... looking at you B-wing). And equally, I was not mesmerized purely by the design of the AAT inherent. Realistically, there&#39;s just not much&nbsp;<em>happening</em>&nbsp;with this set. Not anything we&#39;ve never before that is. Even the minifigs feel rather par for the course.</p>

<p>The power in this set is, in fact, its size. When the thought first struck me, even I did a mental check on what my brain had just metaphorically barfed into in existence. It seems like blasphemy at first consideration, especially when compared against its two older brothers. But my gut reaction was right... for once. Let&#39;s face it, despite many, many Star Wars sets standing as true crown jewels of the Lego medium, the majority of fully realized Star Wars Legos&nbsp;crest the forty and fifty dollar (US) mark. Sure it makes sense from a business standpoint (I doubt there will ever be a point in my lifetime Star Wars&nbsp;<em>doesn&#39;t</em>&nbsp;sell) and even from a &#39;proper&#39; scale view.</p>

<p>But the reality of this is that when given the ability to buy a Star Wars set, an X-wing or TIE fighter will probably win out over an accurately sized AAT in the minds of a lot of people. And that&#39;s why I appreciate, even genuinely like, this smallest of Armored Assault Tanks. For the regular fan or the average kid who isn&#39;t a die hard collector like me or you, this AAT doesn&#39;t ask you make that choice. It can be a spur-of-the-moment set, and even if it isn&#39;t, still makes good and then some on the promises its cover gives.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>The box shows the product on the Battle of Naboo. &nbsp;The instructions are clear and pretty easy to follow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>This set features a lot of tan and dark tan pieces. It also features some gray and black pieces. The set also features some spring loaded shooters and orange missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>The minifigures are very generic. The battle droids are the same as usual and are armed with blasters. Jar Jar Binks is the same as he is seen in other sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>The build featured a lot of technic pieces and complex building styles. It will take only a few minutes if you are an experienced builder, but will take longer if you are not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>The model looks just like the infamous tank in the prequel trilogy. The first play feature is the spring loaded shooters with orange&nbsp;missiles. Next, you can open the cockpits. Last, you can rotate the cannon on the top cockpit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I higly recommend this set, as it is a huge improvement over other variations. This set also goes well with the most recent Flash Speeder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Most box designs follow the Hasbro packaging design due to mandates from Disney, some of which are good designs and some of which are just blah. The packaging here is based on Star Wars Rebels designs, with Sabine&rsquo;s spray painted Stormie helmet in the upper corner and the Rebels symbol in the background.</span></span></span></span></p>

The two side-cannons are a repetitive though quick build due to the mirroring nature of these pieces, the rest is also simple and easy to follow much like others. Breaking builds up by numbered bags seems to shorten build times and allows for quick step-by-step builds using less pieces than if you opened all the bags at once and built it all up in one go like with much older sets from LEGO.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a very nice looking model that is scaled well enough to fit on a shelf display without taking up too much room, and while it may not be 100% to scale with Minifigures, it still works out quite nicely.</span></span></span></span></p>

There are also no stud shooters here to detract from the look of the model. Overall it&rsquo;s really great looking and the driver&rsquo;s compartment and main gunner&rsquo;s station can hold the Battle Droids included in the set quite well, though you will have to push the head down in order to close up the turret gunner&rsquo;s post for the Battle Droid.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;d have to say ultimately if you want this set and don&rsquo;t own an AAT yet, I recommend this set because it works well with the other recently released Naboo Phantom Menace sets. If you&rsquo;re looking for something more exciting, or own past iterations of this model that you prefer you can safely skip this set. I like it for what it is, a cheap option compared to higher priced retired versions on the secondary market with a nice, compact, overall decent looking model for display. And with enough for younger builders to enjoy when they play mock battles on the planet of Naboo. However I understand that my opinion may not be to everybody&rsquo;s tastes, so if you&rsquo;re looking for a decent option for your LEGO Star Wars shelves you can&rsquo;t go wrong here.</span></span></span></span></p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-09-04T23:27:11.967Z","Good set","<p>The Trade Federation Armored Assault Tank has appeared in Lego before but this model is the most accurate to date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Jar Jar Binks: Despite my issues with this character, the minifigure looks superb. He features a custom head piece with eye stalks and long ears in tan with salmon coloured highlights to nice effect. His torso is simple but appropriate with a vest and salmon pink arms. His grey legs are unfortunately unprinted. Jar Jar carries an atlatl weapon, and a fantastic energy shield which is transparent purple with gold trim.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pilot battle droid: Most Lego battle droids use the same custom legs, body, arms and head pieces. The pilot has a blue chest which differentiates it from other battle droids and the custom moulds look very accurate. It carries a blaster pistol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Battle droid: This set includes a standard tan battle droid with a blaster. The figure looks plain but appropriate, however I would have preferred a battle droid commander as it would have been more useful for this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>

<p>The AAT has a unique shape that can be difficult to capture in Lego and this model is reasonably accurate. This set is based on the original Trade Federation version seen in The Phantom Menace and has the appropriately tan colour scheme. &lsquo;In universe&rsquo; the model is a single colour but the mix of tan and dark tan in this set add visual interest.</p>

<p>The smooth shapes at the bottom of the model are created using large curve pieces which look very accurate but are missing the signature missile launcher tubes. I feel they could have been represented using stickers, a print or a redesigned body. I like the fact that this model is sticker free but the lack of missile launchers is unfortunate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The front body section of this model is less smooth than its movie counterpart but looks attractive and has room for a single figure. Two cylinders are angled back adding to the interesting shape of the vehicle.&nbsp;<br />
The two main guns on either side of the body look fantastic but don&rsquo;t rotate. This is possibly my least favourite aspect of the set as they rotate &lsquo;in universe&rsquo; and it would have been very easy to add this feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &lsquo;head&rsquo; of the model where the commander sits is oversized but detailed, and rotates 360 degrees freely. The sides have interesting texture and the front facing cannon can move up and down. The canopy opens and can fit a second figure which allows both the included battle droids to fit in the model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build incorporates a single action feature nicely. Dual, spring-loaded shooters are cleverly integrated into the model and they can be launched by the levers at the back of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
This set is a fairly accurate model of a nice vehicle &lsquo;in universe&rsquo;. It&#39;s not one of the most iconic vehicles but it&#39;s a good build regardless. All the figures are good although I&rsquo;d rather the inclusion of a battle droid commander. The action feature is great and the price good. $40 AUD is neither great value nor bad value so if you find it on sale I definitely recommend this set.&nbsp;<br />

"BillingsBrix","2021-07-17T16:44:41.623Z","Meesa called Jar-jar Binks","<p>First of all, my favourite character is Jar-jar. I received&nbsp;this set as a gift in 2020, 5 years after its release.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Unboxing</b></p>

<p>Opening the box, there are 3 numbered bags and 1&nbsp;instruction book.</p>

<p><b>The build</b></p>

<p>Bag 1 contains the parts to build the base of the aat, along with the spring-loaded shooter&nbsp;mechanism. It also contains Jar-jar Binks.</p>

<p>Bag 2 contains the parts to build the driver&#39;s area, the turret mount, the side canon mounts, and the side pistons.</p>

<p>Bag 3 builds the top turret and the side canons. It also builds the two droids.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigs</b></p>

<p>Jar-jar Binks is a delightful figure, with a special head mould. He also has torso printing on the front and back. He holds a boomba staff and a plasma shield. However, the two droids are very common.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>The completed model</b></p>

<p><i>The aat looks good from the front, but not the back.The top turret turns, but not the side canons. The spring-loaded shooters work well.&nbsp;</i></p>

<p><strong>Overall&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The set costs $66 new and $33 used. I wold recomend this used, but not new.</p>
