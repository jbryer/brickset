"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-30T12:05:35Z","Not bad! Not bad at all.","What a neato set, actually. For being so small, it does have some nice parts, like Jet, lots of tools, some Rock Raiders computer bits, and even an energy crystal. The model itself is quite swooshable, and you can have Jet swoosh over to the whatchamacallit and get tools or analyze the crystal. Plus it's Rock Raiders. (I really like Rock Raiders)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-31T12:12:01.05Z","Rock the boat","This is a nice set for spares.  The simple little hover platform, although nicely built doesn't seem to fit in with the theme.  There's a whole lot of tools and some really great pieces in the set and of course a neon-yellow crystal.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

THis set is cheap and afordable with loads of playability.  Crystal, minifigure, speeder, small/cool base, good accesories, all the necesary components for a truely awesome lego set.  get or you're missin out big time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Simple fun and easy to assemble, goes well with a few other Rock Raiders sets. I really am do like this little set, can't go wrong with it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-12-07T22:11:00.25Z","Tools Galore","This set is great, it has lots of great parts and accessories. It breaks down into two parts, the hover scout and the re-con station. The scout is pretty basic but the baseplate it is constructed on really adds the the feels of the set and gives it an interesting look. Front and back lights, controlled by gear sticks, I think any Rock Raiders collection could use a few of these. 

The re-con station is vital to the scout. It provides position, tools and crystal analysis. The station is equipped with a pick, radio, power handsaw and a torch. It also has a neon yellow crystal which really adds to the set.

The mini-fig is a female. That's right another lady to add to the collection. It it obviously a lady due to the long hair, long eyelashes and lipstick. She is wearing the full blue Rock Raiders uniform, with a breathing apparatus helmet and a neon yellow visor. She also has a pair of binoculars.

Overall I feel it is a mint little set that looks great on display and has heaps of playability, heaps of accessories and fits into the series very nicely. A 6/10 from me. A must for any space or adventure series fan.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Master_Shadow","2007-09-20T01:53:59.793Z","Great!","A Great set! It has all the items needed for this type of set.
The best bits are the peices...It comes with a super rare control console peice, pritty hard to find bace plate for that hovercraft, a tool store with a pickaxe, Radio with Short Handle, chain saw and Binoculars. Really cool helmet and the Neon-Green Helmet Visor suits the helmet well. The tools store can be used for any occasion. The lights on the hover craft really do make it look like a great craft. And the peice that makes this whole set possible to play with...An Energy Crystal :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-29T18:17:16.513Z","First Rock Raiders set","This was my first Rock Raiders set and it got me hooked on the theme. I really like the tools, the hovercraft, and the green crystal. I really think Rock Raiders should have lasted longer, but it didn't. However, I think this one or another Rock Raiders set should become a Lego Legend.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Rgijaba","2008-08-27T21:04:32.11Z","a nice little hover scout.","this set is Jet on a Hover Scout and a little controll pannel of some sort. the scout is a little platform, like the one used on the foot of the old AT-ST, engines on the back and head lights in the front, and a strange brick with levers on it. as for the smaller storage rack thing, it has a map, a raidio, spare head light (for when you lose one of your other ones, i suppose) a pick ax, and (most important of all) an energy crystle! there isn't much playability with this set alone, but you realy can't go wrong with this little classic!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Tri_pod_king","2008-12-23T00:23:01.763Z","I don't know about you, but I liked it!","In honor of the new Power Miner sets coming out, (Oh, come on, you gotta' admit they look cool) I decided to do a review of a 10-year-old Rock Raiders set, The Hover Scout.
                             I got this as an early Christmas present for either Christmas of 1999 or 2000, I can't remember. It didn't take long to build, and it took a lot to get bored of playing with it. This was a good starter set, along with 4930 The Rock Raiders, and has a lot of great pieces and tools. It also included my first female minifig! (I think her name was Jet) The helmet was cool, the crystal was cool, everything was cool! Especially the Brickonium (or Bricktonium) crystal. There wasn't that much to the set, as far as I remember, though. This was a classic set and if you see it in a garage sale or something, and is the right price, (under $7.99) I'd get this set!

"krysto2002","2008-07-23T16:52:27.81Z","For the fan, collector and player","This set is straight from the game (with a little somethign extra) and even alone is a great set. This has plenty of tools, which can be used numerous ways, and plenty of reuseable parts. The set has plenty of playability and for its price is a great deal. The clips may tend to bend if treated poorly, thus loosening their grip, but this applies to all clips, so remember, parts like that need to be handled gently. The minifigure incleded is fine, and looks great, but what older minifigures lack that new ones don't is the double sided printing, which adds a really cool touch, if only LEGO had invented that sooner. Since the set has tail lights, it keeps the back from being bland, and the control panel keeps the whole set from being just a ship, like many other sets that don't  do as well as the great ones.

A good price, a great set, who can resist!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2009-10-27T20:09:16.53Z","Awesome","Rock Raiders, in my oppinion is, and has been since the day I first saw them, THE BEST Lego Theme ever. This set is great in so many ways. You get Jet, who is my second favorite Rock Raider, an energy crystal, and several tools along with the Hover Scout and mini power thingy. 

Pros:
Great playability (or at least I managed to have a good time with only this and the Rapid Rider...)
Jet
Tools
Energy Crystals (I can never have enough!)
Teal!
Computer slope and tile

Cons:
...


All in all, this is a great set, and far better than the Stone Chopper of the Power Miners series. I highly reccomend this to anyone. Thank you.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-28T20:22:07.223Z","Hover? I hardly know 'er!","<div>I have already made my opinion known regarding the Rock Raiders as a whole, and I find that the Hover Scout is also somewhat emblematic of the problems faced by the theme. Thereâs always a danger of being too harsh when reviewing the smallest impulse sets, but really, when compared against sets like the Small Car (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=3177-1"">3177</a>), BBQ Stand (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=8398-1"">8398</a>), or - a little closer to home thematically and age-wise, perhaps - Sea Sprint 9 (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6125-1"">6125</a>), Hover Scout is just not quite there.</div><div><br></div><div>I suppose a large part of this is that the already tiny piececount is divided between two things: a computer terminal thing and the Hover Scout itself. Of these, the computer terminal thing is definitely the superior build. I guess the idea is that a Rock Raider person sticks a crystal on the top of the terminal and the computer determines its purity or something. Whatever it is, itâs a simple build that functions well in spite of its size.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>On the other hand, the Hover Scout is basically a specialised piece with a couple of decorative odds and ends on it. Compare this to the hovering vehicle included in The Rock Raiders HQ (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=4990-1"">4990</a>), which is so much more detailed in spite of being the same size. As a matter of fact, given that a nearly identical build shows up in that set, it begs the question as to what is so special about this one if one had a goal of collecting the Rock Raiders theme to some degree of completeness, which most surely would involve purchasing the HQ.</div><div><br></div><div>But I guess itâs not all bad. Hover Scout does come with a lot of great tools for your Rock Raiders to use, and the female Minifig (Iâm almost certain she actually has a name; I just donât remember it) is relatively uncommon. As far as impulse sets go, though, I feel that there are much better. As such, I would have to say that this set is strictly for Rock Raiders completionists only.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,2,4,3,3,3
