"Yorick","2015-01-02T01:34:38.98Z","Best battle pack yet!","<p>LEGO has made many Star Wars battle packs over the last 8 years, and this set is the best of all of them.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty standard, the front has a large image of the model, and the back has a few little pictures demonstrating the features in the set.</p>

<p>The instructions look the same, but in the back of the instructions, there isn&#39;t a mini poster with pictures of all of the star wars sets, or a list of minifigs. It is easy to follow, like all LEGO instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts in this set are pretty common, but a&nbsp; part of interest is&nbsp;definitely the trans-black 1x2 plate, which has come on very few sets, and there are six of them here.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I am really impressed with these new Stormtrooper minifigures. Unlike every other battle pack, there are 4 identical Stormtroopers (other then their heads, there are 2 different heads and 2 of each of them). LEGO has made many different types of battle packs, and all of them have a few different minifigs, this making it rather difficult for fans to get large amounts of troops; clone battle packs had 2-3 types of clones, and usually only one of them was a basic clone. The &quot;mouths&quot; on these Stormtroopers are different from the older stormies;&nbsp;the corners droop much lower then the older style. They don&#39;t match, but they look decent next to each other, not as bad as I feared when purchasing this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took maybe 10 minutes, but im not the fastest builder. It was an enjoyable build, with more little details then a typical battle pack. this wasn&#39;t a hard build; a 4-5 year old could easily build this set without much difficulty.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model is good for a battle pack; there was clearly a creativity involved when designing this set, but the model lacks some fundamental elements. The vehicle that the Stormies go on has no thrusters or propulsion. How does it move?</p>

<p>The playability is decent; the shooting guns are going to be loved by all children who can get their hands on them.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I liked this set;&nbsp;I would definitely get another given the chance. LEGO better make more battle packs like this in the future.</p>

"Mymaker_Rex","2015-01-03T19:52:01.847Z","Small but Sweet","<p>Hello, and welcome to my review of the Imperial Troop Transport. This set is based off of the vehicle of the same name form the Star Wars : Rebels TV show, and despite being horrifically out of scale, is a welcome addition to any Lego Star Wars fan&#39;s collection.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a small size, the same as all of the battle packs in this wave, and to the annoyance of some sports a Disney logo on both sides of the box. I myself am indifferent to this change;&nbsp;after all, it&#39;s the set we&#39;re after, isn&#39;t it? The instruction manual is rather dull, as with most; this particular one is 35 pages, with the build finishing on page 33. Riveting!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts included are mainly light bluish grey, along with some white, trans red and dark bluish grey pieces, with the occasional tinted piece, used mainly for the glass at the front of the vehicle. Again, not particularly interesting, although there&nbsp;are many&nbsp;slope pieces, which could be useful for certain buildings in MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Here is where the pace starts to pick up! The two variants of mini figures (yes, there are indeed two) are storm troopers, using the Rebels design found in The Ghost set, and can also be found in this year&#39;s AT-DP. The &quot;Italian Mustache&quot; design for the helmet is prefectley acceptable to me as although it appears strange, is accurate to the show. The different variants come with the heads; two with &quot;angry clone&quot; heads and two with a new &quot;grinning clone&quot; head, as I call them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very basic, not too entertaining, but gets the job done. The simplistist nature may bore younger builders, but for teens and up the build is so easy that the vehicle is complete before they have the chance to lose interest!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All in all, a nice set. The extra ammo storage is handy as I often lose spares. The flick missiles are the same as always, and the firing blasters&nbsp;too. They can attach behind the troops when they are stood in the transport, guarded by light bluish grey flaps, similar to the TV appearance of the vehicle. The vehicle is obviously way out of scale, being able to fit 3 on each side and 3 pilots in the front comfortably, but you can only expect so much from a battle pack...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set is definitley one to get multiple of. The figures great, making this (I believe) to be the first battle pack with nothing but 4, plain Stromtroopers. The build is small yet nice, with accurate-ish features and room for all 4 figures. A cheap price means you can build up your imperial army in no time!</p>

"Mineninja101","2015-04-09T01:32:02.49Z","The BEST Battle Pack yet","<p>My Grandma took me out for my birthday like she has for as long as I can remember. I had asked her if she could take me out after Christmas because the 2015 Lego sets were out. We went to the local Lego store and I bought Two of this set, one 75079: Shadow Troopers, and one 75083: AT-DP.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just a plain box with sort of a sand grey color to it. The instructions were nice and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The best parts in this set are the many sloped parts, other than that the rest are very common and easy in other sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four Stormtroopers. This is the only set in Lego Starwars history to come with four Stormtroopers. That is the best thing about this set. My only complaint about this set is the weapons: stud shooters.&nbsp; They don&#39;t make good guns for stormtroopers.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set was very easy to build.&nbsp; I would recommend this for young builders who wish to build an army of Stormtroopers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete build is very, very sturdy. Another reason why this is a good set for young builders who wish to build and army of Stormtroopers. This set has functions. Number one is the spinning gun on the top. Number two, you can open and close the flaps that enclose the stormtroopers. Lastly you can pull out a box filled with studs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is one of my favorite Starwars sets that I own. I plan on buying more of these. I hope this review was helpful.</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-10-31T06:12:38.03Z","Nice figures, but the vehicle...","<p>When I saw this set in a shop I had to buy it. Four Stormtroopers from&nbsp;<em>Rebels</em>&nbsp;were needed in my army, and I wanted an Imperial Troop Transport too. I thought I didn&#39;t care about the inaccuracy of the vehicle, considering it like a micro-set. But however, now I have to say that it&#39;s too different from original and too big respect a micro-set to be considered a normal vehicle or a micro-set. So... let&#39;s&nbsp;just review it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was very small, like other Battle Packs. However the images on it were pretty attractive, and on the rear it was shown how to use the ITT playable parts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are all common. Just Stormtroopers&#39; weapons are a bit more rare, although nowadays they are in most of Star Wars sets. So nothing special, regarding parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Yeah, minifigures are the best part: four&nbsp;<em>Rebels</em>&nbsp;Stormtrooper, armed and... well, not dangerous, considering their aim. However they are very nice and you can use their shooters to create a blaster barrage. Or you can simply imagine a funny chase with the Lothal rebels.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fast, I took less than a quarter of hour. The Transport is easy to build, but the cockpit part wasn&#39;t that bad.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model, as I said, disappointed me a bit. It&#39;s small and different from original model: only four spaces for Stormtrooper (six in the TV series), front guns are similar to cannons from real world (mobile and tiny in the TV series), AA turret made by two missiles and only rotating (liftable and made by two lasers in the TV series). This is just what I have to say, but however I enjoyed it although these differencies.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>So, it&#39;s very different from original but it hosts four nice Stormtroopers. Considering I paid&nbsp;it 16/17&euro;, was it worth the price? Yeah, I think so. I&#39;m very fussy about Lego Star Wars, and I expect from every set to be identical to original model. It isn&#39;t obviously possible, but I found this set very very different, so I&#39;d like Lego to release a real-size version of Imperial Troop Transport: I&#39;ll surely buy it, since I do like the vehicle in&nbsp;<em>Rebels</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Low price</p>

<p>&ndash; Includes from&nbsp;<em>Rebels&nbsp;</em>Stormtrooper</p>

<p>&ndash; A lot of playable parts</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Inaccurate and different from TV series vehicle</p>

"Dalek135","2015-12-02T00:17:37.29Z","A Battle Pack of Grumpy Stormtroopers","<p>This is my first Lego review, so I&#39;ll keep this simple. I settled down to review this set because it is one of my true favorites and also my first set of&nbsp;Stormtroopers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>The box artwork is really nice. However, though this is probably unavoidable due to the size of the box, the instructions were crumpled, which made it hard to read without holding it open.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:<br />
&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Parts were a nice selection of grey plus a few black pieces for the cannons and small elements of red and white. Last are the 3 brown glass pieces used for the viewscreen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Before I start talking about the minifigures, I must admit I have never watched Star Wars Rebels in my life and probably never will.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These are fantastic minifigures that as far as I can tell from looking at pictures resemble their on-screen counterparts. The armor is incredibly detailed and as always, the helmets look almost identical to the real thing. The heads of two stormtroopers are the usual angry expression while the other two are a new passive&nbsp;expression.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now&nbsp;many people complain about the fact that Lego&nbsp;Stormtroopers&nbsp;have the same face most of the time. I myself do not mind because you rarely see a&nbsp;stormtrooper&#39;s&nbsp;face. The stormtroopers carry the stud-firing blaster that is the new norm. I don&#39;t really mind it very much. Sometimes I imagine it&#39;s a grenade launcher.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>The build was enjoyable and fast, perhaps 30 minutes. It probably would have been faster had the instructions been unfolded. They had a tendency to fold over whenever I let go of them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>Excellent! This is perhaps one of the best battlepacks&nbsp;I have. You can fit all four stormtroopers on the vehicle along with their weapons. Another&nbsp;advantage is that you can easily carry the whole set by just packing the stormtroopers on it and going. No more walking down the stairs with a pile of minifigs in one hand and a model in the other!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The playability is okay. Though flick missiles are not my personal favorite, the stud blasters are excellent. Even though I hardly use them, they are a really fun(if inaccurate) toy. Kids could drive the vehicle into battle and have fun disembarking them into the midst of a battle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set is really a great one. 4 virtually identical minifigs&nbsp;provide a way to quickly gather armies of stormtroopers. The vehicle can transport all the minifigs so it is excellent for travel in the real or fictional world. This is a great army builder and unlike most battlepacks it has an equally interesting model.&nbsp;</p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2016-07-31T07:59:16.07Z","Don't Rebel against getting this pack","<p>After rebuilding my 4483 AT-AT in early 2015, I noticed that I could do with a few more troops on the Imperial side. With that on my mind, one of the first things I bought with my pay from my spring seasonal job was this battle pack. At the time I had no interest in Rebels (due to a now-embarrassing misconception that reading up on the show cleared up), but four Stormtroopers was four Stormtroopers.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small enough that you could just about cram it into the lower pocket of a pair of cargo shorts, as befits a battlepack. Like most smaller LEGO boxes these days, it has glued sides and a punch-out flap (both for ease of opening and as a deterrent to people filching parts and figures out of the box). It depicts the transport and its passengers in action on Lothal.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear and easy to follow. You might want to let them sit open for a bit, let them lose some of their springiness from being crammed into the confines of the package.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts are plates and slopes, in white and gray with a little red. Can be used in many things if one should choose to break the vehicle up. There&#39;s also some more interesting parts, such as a 2x2 turntable plate, some 1x2 double-hole Technic bricks, three 1x4 bricks with a groove in the side for sliding functions, and a 2x2x2 crate. You also get four stud-shooting blasters, their triggers, and plenty of translucent red studs to load them with.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get four standard Imperial Stormtroopers. They have very detailed printing, which stands out considerably when placed next to older stormtrooper minifigs. There is some stylization to match the cartoon, namely the exaggerated &quot;frown&quot; of the filter, but it&#39;s easily enough ignored when standing them amongst the ranks of non-stylized troopers. They use the same two generic human faces as the other 2015 battle packs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build goes by quickly, as one would expect for such a small, simple set. You&#39;re not going to be pulling your hair out trying to build this unless you&#39;re having a really bad day.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a shrunken, somewhat deformed version of the transports from the show; like a four-man Microfighter version. It&#39;s closer in relative size to the show vehicle&#39;s inspiration (a Kenner toy called the Imperial Troop Transporter). The two barrels of the roof turret are represented by flick-fire missiles for extra play value. It&#39;s fairly solid and holds the troopers easily.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is an excellent battle pack set. You get four regular soldiers, making it ideal for building armies up. The transport itself is very nice both as a model in its own right, and as a source of parts should you choose to break it up (as I did). It&#39;s well worth getting, and getting duplicates of.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts &nbsp; Not many total, but many are simply basic. The front blasters can be used on rifles as Clone rifles. There are a few other useful parts, but not very.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp; &nbsp;For $12.99, four updated Stormtroopers is great! When they updated the design in 2014, I was a little&nbsp;disappointed. With this set, though, I finally got my numbers back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build &nbsp; This thing could hold 9&nbsp;stormtroopers, 1 Combat Driver, and 6 prisoners or more troops in Rebels, now 4 troopers, That&#39;s it. I think this thing Could be better if you MOCed one out of 4 or so. But that&#39;s and IF.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model &nbsp; I would buy one of this or more just for the Stormtroopers. I honestly do not care about the stud guns, not much of a problem. The build stinks as a whole, but the TROOPS ARE WORTH IT. The build is salvage, though, which gives lots of spare parts.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2017-02-23T14:51:47.687Z","Freeze rebel!","<p>Still packing a great punch. After a few years of Star Wars Rebels and many sets with these Stormtroopers&nbsp;how have they held up? Let&#39;s read on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Like most battlepacks their appeal lies in their figures. This battlepack&nbsp;bears 4 Rebels styled Imperial Stormtroopers. But there in lies the rub for many folks with regards to this set. The printing is quite blocky and is more accurate to the TV show that inspired the set than to the Stormtroopers most fans are used to seeing on film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get 4 armor prints and helmets that are identical and 2 pairs of head prints, though both types of head prints are for clone troopers, something which is very odd as the series takes place much closer to Episode IV and thus most clones would be too old for continued active duty in the Galactic Empire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said the printing is very well done for what it is and the colors contrast well with the all-white armor of these troopers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>At just a bit over 100 pieces the build is simple and the lack of stickers make it go that much faster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once complete we get a very small version of what otherwise would be a very large transporter capable of holding many more troopers than the 4 this one carries. Still this design would go on to be used in the Freemaker&nbsp;Adventures and it looked oddly fitting there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As this one has no room for a pilot you will have to pretend the entire vehicle is a droid and the troopers issue commands to it. The model comes with a crate in the center of the build for extra ammo for our troopers. Additionally it has 2 flick-fire missiles on a turret on the aft section and two very large cannon barrels on the nose. Despite its sole function as a transport it actually can defend the troopers and provide fire support.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Before getting into this line of Star Wars LEGO I was very hesitant about the troopers&#39;&nbsp;design. Though I personally have grown to really like it. The colors are bold and the troopers, despite the more accented frown, do manage to fit in nicely with their more accurately printed brethren.</p>

<p>Still, I realize that for many their appearance is a deal breaker. If, however, you do not mind the look and simply need to amass many troopers then this set was quite a bargain and if you can still get your hands on it for a reasonable price it will still be able to fill your Stormtrooper ranks quickly. Plus they look great in multiples and with regular blasters. Not a bad little set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a standard box for a battle pack. It is the rebel style of box with a stormtrooper in the top right corner and the star wars rebels and the Disney logo in the bottom right.</p>

<p>It shows the stormtroopers disembarking from the transport under fire. The back shows play features and some shots of the stormtroopers. One shows the stormtroopers looking hard and showing of the might of the empire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found no mistakes in the instructions and they were easy to follow</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are pretty standard although this is to be expected from a battle pack. You do get four stud blasters</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes four stormtroopers with the rebel style printing. It is very detailed and there are no mistakes. Underneath the helmets are the standard angry clone heads, however one has a different print which looks like a questioning look. I like this diversity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some people say these stormtroopers stand out from the original trilogy version, but I think it is the other way round. At first I thought they were odd but they look normal now and here&#39;s why: the OT stormtroopers have yet to be released in a battle pack making the Rebels stormtrooper the more common.</p>

<p>My only complaints are that they could have included an extra helmet defaced with the phoenix logo as on the box(there is always a polybag) and the stud blasters. These are fun but oversized for a standard blaster. I tend to use them as heavy weapons or starship blasters</p>

<p>The build is quick and fun and easy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model is surprisingly good for a battlepack. Some people think the stormtroopers look silly standing up(I&#39;m fine with it) but you can make them sit down by turning the 4211613 sliding piece the over way round or replacing it with a 2x1x1 piece.</p>

<p>I think it is a solid troop transport but is nothing like the vehicle that it is based on which should seat six. I hope that they release a &pound;25 pound set of it in the future .</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I think this is an excellent army building set as it includes four of the same set. Even you don&#39;t like the build you still get four figures.</p>

<p>It costs &pound;11.99 like all battlepacks. I own two, one I bought for full retail price the other I got discounted for &pound;5.40. I am tempted to go get another for the reduced price.</p>

<p>I think you should definitely buy at least one of these if you are a star wars fan</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>*I will refer to this set and the vehicle as the ITT during this review*</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Building Experience-4/5</h2>

<p>Of all the parts of this battle pack, the build is the weakest. That&#39;s not surprising though, considering the price point of $15 USD. However, that does not say that the build undermines the fact that it still represents the ITT very well in the general shape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts-5/5</h2>

<p>Of course the other highlight is that you get 4 rebels-style stormtroopers in this set. They appear in 6 total sets, so they are somewhat common. Some highlights of the parts is the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4520307/box-2x2x2"">box</a>&nbsp;piece which you can never have too many of and&nbsp;4 of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6011817/flag-with-2-holders"">flag</a>&nbsp;piece in light gray. Besides that the pieces are mostly of the light gray colour. Also included are the always controversial stud shooters, 4 of them to be exact.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Playability-4/5&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s talk about the ITT now. Most fans should be able to recognise the ITT instantly, especially because of its newfound presence in Rebels and The Mandalorian. There are 4 places to fit troopers in on the sides, and the flag pieces can be moved up and down to simulate the doors. The crate piece can also slide into the center with a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4211613/sliding-piece-1x4"">sliding piece</a>. Also&nbsp;within the ITT is spots to store all the stormtrooper&#39;s blasters. The ITT is also equipped with 2 flick fire missiles situated towards the back of the vehicle, in the appropriate spot compared to the real model. However where the model falters is the lack of cockpit. There are some&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6001197/plate-1x2-tr"">trans-gray pieces</a>&nbsp;that are supposed to be a windshield, but it also disrupts the scale of the model because it is quite small in comparison to minifigures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Value for money-5/5</h2>

<p>For an original price of $15, it was a great deal and a great army builder as well, thanks to it&#39;s lack of annoying generic officers and/or crew members (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75132-1/First-Order-Battle-Pack"">see here</a>). However, it currently goes for around $26 new and $16 used, and I can see it&#39;s value increasing over the years because of the novel vehicle. If you like the rebel style stormtrooper, then this set is for you. Otherwise, something like&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75262-1/Imperial-Dropship-%E2%80%93-20th-Anniversary-Edition"">75262</a>&nbsp;Imperial Dropship or&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75165-1/Imperial-Trooper-Battle-Pack"">75165</a>&nbsp;Imperial Battle Pack may be better for you, even though they are more expensive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Great set! I like the recognizable vehicle for once, and having 4 of all the same minifigure is a sight to behold.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you found this review helpful.&nbsp;</p>

"RichardRSA","2021-01-08T22:31:15.957Z","A perfect battle pack","<p>I&#39;m not going to bother with breaking stuff down. It&#39;s 4 stormtroopers and an actual vehicle. There&#39;s even proper storage space for their blasters and the extra studs. The whole thing really is quite clever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing else to say, it&#39;s a battle pack, but one that doesn&#39;t waste its parts.</p>
