It&#39;s actually a pretty nice ship and a kind of predecessor to the X-Wing&nbsp;so having bought the microfighter&nbsp;version of that craft I thought this would make a nice addition to my mini micro collection and was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing special here, the box art shows that it is&nbsp;paired with the Vulture Droid - which doesn&#39;t appeal to me too much - and shows the other series 2 models and the minifig on the sides and back. Instructions are clear and straightforward as per usual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts come in 2 small bags and are pretty standard with the addition of some specific printed discs for the engine intakes. Mostly white and dark red with some black and&nbsp;grey for the solid parts which makes a nice change from the&nbsp;grey look of many SWMFs. Several white and grey trans&nbsp;cheese wedges for detailing, some studs and grilles and the 4 small wings use the clip on &#39;flag&#39; type pieces but with an angled edge. The wingtip cannons use a long pole type piece that secures into a double clip and is held very securely.</p>

<p>There&nbsp;are the same pink trans studs used on the X-Wing for jets and some bright green trans parts for the guns and flick missile heads. The curved wing tips are represented by the red 2x2 plates with the semicircle ends &amp;&nbsp;an antenna piece is used for the tailgun. Overall the parts are OK and there&#39;s enough variety that you could build your own starfighter variant if you got bored of this one.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Seems to be one of the less common minifigs and its a nice one. He has a cool helmet and printed visor/face plus the usual mini pistol. Would have been nice to have a leg print but the torso print is neat and double sided. He is my son&#39;s&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;so that&#39;s good for me.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing terribly challenging but fun enough - its mostly studs up apart from the nose, wingtips and engines. The way the engine and smaller wings clip together was neat, using a repurposed&nbsp;flick missile stick. The whole thing holds together well and feels solid. Nice inclusion of a clip for the pilot&#39;s blaster.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks really nice complete from most angles, the hinged wings mean you can pose it in &#39;attack&#39; position or not if you prefer.&nbsp;Chunky microfighter proportions and the overall look lend it&nbsp;to being whooshed about. The pilot fits in his cockpit nicely and it all works together well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Initially I was only going to get the AT-AT and Snowspeeder from this series but picked this up anyway on a whim and really like it - as does my son who helped me put it together. It&#39;s not really the most iconic of SW&nbsp;vehicles but it&#39;s a nice kit anyway so if you like the Microfighter theme then I&#39;d recommend it.</p>

"rex501","2015-04-04T18:01:27.54Z","pretty good build but had a small flaw","<p>When I heard that this set was coming out i was really interested in it and since no pictures were released yet, I had good hopes for the minifigure and the minifigure still fascinates me.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is normal sized and has a good picture on the front and the standard picture of the vehicle and minifigure walking and the flick-fire missles. The instructions are normal. nothing really new about them except when you start the build they have you building it from a back view for almost the entire booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are pretty standard except for a new 4x4 piece that has the middle 2x2 cut out of it but other than that the only thing interesting were the little colored studs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure is amazing and his hemet print is really cool. his face print is also really interesting and overall i am very satisfied with it</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was pretty interesting and was fun but found one problem with it. right behind the engine parts is the little gray clip that holds the flick-fire engine wing part. when I&nbsp;built it it was not going in the clip all the way because the wing part was too thick and so could not clip in all the way and was hard to turn to attack mode so i just switched it with the dark gray stud that sits behind it and fixed the problem.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>the completed model is normally chunky&nbsp;and is overall not very interesting but it still is worth the buy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set is overall worth the buy just for the minifigure and the minifigure looks pretty good in it so I am satisfied with it.</p>

"PooPotato","2015-07-28T20:12:35.793Z","My Favorite MicroFighter!","<p>When I buy a MicroFighter, it&#39;s usually for the minifigure&nbsp;so I can compliment one of my ongoing dioramas, such as The Battle of Geonosis or the Battle of Hoth. &nbsp;I usually don&#39;t pay too much mind to the mini-model, but this set is definitely an exception. &nbsp;I have always been very fond of the ARC-170, the 2005 7259 ARC-170 Fighter was my largest Star Wars set for quite a while, and I would say it is my favorite star fighter from the Prequel Trilogy. &nbsp;So keeping this in mind, it is easy to see why I snatched this off the shelf as soon as I saw it, and for once I was actually looking forward to building and displaying the mini-model. &nbsp;It is shown prominently in the beginning of Star Wars Episode III, and also makes a shorter appearance during the Order 66 sequence. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Little box, little instruction booklet. &nbsp;Not a lot to say here :P</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part selection is quite nice for this vehicle, with two printed pieces for the turbine and a nice mix of dark red and white. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Open Helmet&nbsp;Clone Pilot included with this set is one of the few minifigs from the MicroFighter line that I have no use for. &nbsp;I used the Closed Helmet Clone Pilot as the co-pilot for my Gunship in the Geonosis diorama, and I used the Rebel Pilot in a snowspeeder for the Hoth diorama. &nbsp;When Lego released their Episode III line, they didn&#39;t really focus on one aspect or scene of the movie, and released a large variety of vehicles from different parts of the film, so there really was no incentive for me to collect them all. &nbsp;With that being said, the Clone Pilot included with this set is a huge improvement over the ones included with 7259, as V-Wing pilots were used for that set due to technical limitations. &nbsp;The open helmet looks great, with a cool looking orange and yellow stripe down the middle. &nbsp;It is also nice that Lego didn&#39;t reuse the orange goggle printed Zev Senesca face and actually printed a new double sided Clone Trooper face with the goggles. &nbsp;One face looks moderately determined while the other looks angry. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly standard but fun. &nbsp;I love how the engines were built, and the customary flick-fires were hidden quite well. &nbsp;The nose of the aircraft was captured perfectly, and the main wingtip blasters look very tough. &nbsp;Unlike the other Microfighters I have, there is a clip next to the rear turret for the Pilot&#39;s sidearm.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is easily my favorite MicroFighter. &nbsp;It is a vehicle that I am very fond of, it comes with a cool minifigure that I really have no use for, and it represents it&#39;s bigger brother very well. &nbsp;I would have loved to see another full-size remake of this set from Lego, but I don&#39;t foresee that happening anytime soon with the new movie coming out this Winter. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Nice looking Minifig</p>

<p>Awesome Model</p>

<p>Nice piece Selection</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Same old price complaint</p>

<p>No real use for the minifig outside of this set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall my favorite Microfighter, and hopefully Lego continues with another wave.</p>

"VaderFan2187","2016-10-27T06:53:39.327Z","Missable, though the figure is quite good ","<p>Microfighters are cute. Some can be not-so-great (AAT), some can be great (Star Destroyer). Which category does this fall under?</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>Typical Microfighter-style box, small and compact. Not much action can be shown, thanks to the inclusion of only one figure and one mini ship. Just a standard box.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Like all other Microfighters, this build is pretty brief. Nothing particularly exciting here too.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Aside from the minifig helmet and the two PRINTED round tiles, there&#39;s no really interesting part in this set...</p>

<h3>Playability&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Only play function actually included is two flick missiles under the wings. Whats more fun that that is swooshing the ship around. But... that&#39;s about it.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Only one is included, and he&#39;s not good enough to be incentive for the set. His helmet looks too bulky to me, and he would benefit from a moulded visor. His face looks kinda weird. The torso is nice, but the legs are plain.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Decent value, at 95 parts this is one of the microfighters with better value.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Missable. Unless you love clone pilots or you are a microfighter completist, this set doesn&#39;t have much.&nbsp;</p>
