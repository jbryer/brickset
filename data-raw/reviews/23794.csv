Part of this is because I have a four-year-old and these are perfect for that age to play with since rebuilds aren&#39;t a major headache. Past that, I appreciate the accessibility of $10 a pop for some iconic SW vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a box, follow the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Giving this a five based on the&nbsp;<em>printed</em>&nbsp;roof tile in the front. Ratchet pieces are always good and the back grill/exhaust are not very common. This set hits the 10 cent/piece mark nicely, though for the size a $7.99 price tag would be nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I believe this minifig is exclusive to this set (minifig is currently not updated on&nbsp;Brickset), so bonus for that. Even if it&#39;s not, the grey helmet with red rebel log is great, the torso/leg printing is appropriate, and the white gloves make it Hoth-centric.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The best of the microfighters line are some of my favorite builds for what the designers come up within the ~100 piece limit. This build&nbsp;is fairly elegant with&nbsp;angled slopes and the robust cannons.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Chibi&nbsp;(cute-ish miniaturization) is great in limited doses and I think the microfighters line is perfect application for it. This build&nbsp;captures the look of the ship&nbsp;as well as 75049, given what it is. Flick missiles&nbsp;are neatly hidden under the wings increasing playability while keeping the model clean. Great snowspeederfor a kid (or adult) to swoosh around the house.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Love it. Paired with the AT-AT 75075, it&#39;s the best of Series 2 (Series 1 honors go to Millenium Falcon,&nbsp;75030).&nbsp;</p>

"joemmo","2015-03-17T22:29:05.99Z","One of the best Microfighters","<p>These are great kits, they remind of the simplicity and fun of the pocket money Space kits I used to buy as a child - just a vehicle and a minifig but of course these have extra nostalgia value with the Star&nbsp;Wars&nbsp;theme. They&#39;re fun to build and make good desktop models and you know, you can let the kids play with them too.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box art pairs this with the AT-AT - obviously. Other than that, standard stuff.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>97 parts in total&nbsp;but this builds up into one of the smallest microfighters, I think because so many of those parts are wedges in white, grey, orange and trans grey! Wings are a variety of angled flats.&nbsp;The cannons use some technic pieces quite cleverly to add some nice greebly detail&nbsp;and there are also some ratchet hinges that are used to hold the wings at an angle. Custom printed nose slope adds a nice touch.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I always liked the Rebel pilots and this guy is cool. Similar to the X-Wing pilot but with a grey helmet and some different printing -&nbsp;he has some great facial expressions. Comes with the standard mini-blaster</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing too complex as you&#39;d expect, its nearly all studs up apart from the cannons&nbsp;but&nbsp;the way the wedges, triangular flats&nbsp;and hinges are used to create the shape of the speeder is pretty neat.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like this one and of all the Microfighters, this is one of&nbsp;the most &#39;accurate&#39;. It captures the shape and stance very well. The only thing I&#39;m not madly keen on is how the wings are little loose on the ratchet hinges but in reality it doesn&#39;t affect the model much.</p>

<p>Importantly for play - this is a kids toy remember - this one holds together pretty well for zooming and crashing about no matter how you pick it up. That can&#39;t be said for all the series.</p>

<p>The flickfire missiles are nicely hidden underneath but also easy to fire, &nbsp;- its not important to me but my son loves to &#39;boom&#39; them.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The Snowspeeder and AT-AT are a great combination, probably the strongest of the series 1&amp;2&nbsp;in my opinion and if you&#39;re a fan of the original trilogy then this is one to get.</p>

He looks great and isn&rsquo;t the exact same as the pilot with the x-wing, which could have easily been done. Great for army building fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

On the underside of the two wings are flick-fire missiles, which is pretty functional and doesn&rsquo;t detract from the overall design of the vehicle compared to the placements on some of the others. The towline is made of a standard LEGO control stick piece, which works, but is a bit weaker compared to how nice the gun builds worked. I might have preferred a small microbuild in place of the single piece for this particular feature of the vehicle.</span></span></span></span></p>

If you can still find this where you are, which shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, grab this up.</span></span></span></span></p>
