<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Boxwithinstructionsyesitis.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too spectacular, though Jang at Jangbricks got way excited for this <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6089147"">new plate with hole piece</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>AT-AT pilot is only found one other pleace and he looks great. The back of the helmet is up too high and shows a lot of skin, otherwise love it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quick but satisfying build. As with my other reviews of the microfighter line, I enjoy how each piece has an obvious purpose and there&#39;s very little excess to these builds.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Surprisingly, it feels complete. At first seeing the pictures for this model, I was skeptical at how an AT-AT would translate to this scale, particularly because there are no knee joints in the legs and the flick missiles hang awkwardly off the side of the body. The completed model is just what it&#39;s supposed to be, incorporating all of the major elements and just being fun to play with. My four-year-old loves this model because of the poses and character it has.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Get it. Make it fight with the snowspeeder. Enjoy.</p>

"Tar_Domo","2015-01-17T13:17:45.933Z","It looks so fun","<p>This is my first series 2 microfighter. When I saw the pictures about the upcoming LSW sets this was one of those that made me exited about this winter wave.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A standard small microfighter box. Instructions were a very thin booklet and they were easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This has some cool round parts. It includes also a lot grey parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>AT-AT Walker is the only minifigure. It is the new version with the grey helmet and comes with a pistol.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took maybe 10 minutes. There were no problems and I made no mistakes. This should be easy to build even for small kids, a perfect first&nbsp;lego star wars set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This has&nbsp;three main&nbsp;features:</p>

<p>&gt; Two flick-fire missiles</p>

<p>&gt; you can put its legs to many different positions, making it look fun or more realistic (it looks fun anyway)</p>

<p>&gt; its head moves</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Nice add, has great features and is fun. those legs are so short, it makes it so fun!</p>

"AdeelZubair","2016-06-25T14:23:12.61Z","Cute, Cute, CUTE!","<p>The &lsquo;Star Wars - Microfighters&rsquo; sub-theme is one which has a very unique style which fans like to call &lsquo;Chibi.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s basically models which are out of scale for Minifigures which also have exaggerated proportions for particular elements of the model. It&rsquo;s a huge improvement over the previous &lsquo;Planets&rsquo; sub-theme in terms of successful products. This is why henceforth it has taken its place and has proven to be successful in sales, and indicates why it will return in 2016 for a third wave.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>As with all &lsquo;Star Wars &ndash; Microfighters&rsquo; this set also comes with one Minifigure, in this instant it is a AT-AT Driver which has only appeared in one other set (75054 - AT-AT) in this exact variant.</p>

<p>This variant comes with a small black pistol and is the fourth design of the AT-AT Driver in the LEGO medium. The &lsquo;135 - Sand Blue&rsquo; colour is a huge improvement over the previous design which had greys instead. I believe the 194 - Light Stone Grey&rsquo; is also accurate for the helmet judging by the reference I found from the movie. The printing on the head, torso and legs is outstanding; this is definitely the best variant of the character in the medium.</p>

<p>Sadly this Minifigure has two problems one is the use of a Clone Trooper head which has even shown up on the new First Order Stormtroopers. Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t see this tread going away anytime soon, it&rsquo;s pretty sad given how inaccurate it is for Star Wars fans. Honestly substituting it for a blank head would have solved that particular issue. The other problem in terms of design and accuracy is that the shoulder pads are absent; I&rsquo;m not exactly sure how it could have been achieved other than printing, having small fabric would have been redundant given how small this detail is. These two issues aren&rsquo;t anything too major to take away from this incredible Minifigure; one of them could easily be fixed with one additional head element, it&rsquo;s these type of issues I feel should be raised to improve upon future products.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience / Display Attributes</strong></p>

<p>The Microfighter AT-AT took up to 10 minutes to assemble given how small the model is. The set contains two small unnumbered bags and one instruction manual. The model starts with the main body which uses three SNOT (Studs Not On Top) assemblies; two on the sides and one on the rear.</p>

<p>The rear has a clip which could allow you to clip the AT-AT Driver&rsquo;s pistol onto it if you choose to. Next we follow with the head which has an awesome amount of detail and representation given how accurate it is in this scale. One thing I dislike about the head is the absence of the small ball joint system which doesn&rsquo;t allow its head to move around more freely; another easy fix with only five elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1x 6039479 - Plate 1X2 Ball &Oslash;5.9 Middle</li>
	<li>2x 4211397 - Plate 2X2</li>
	<li>1x 6043656 - Plate 1X2 Ball Cup / Friction Middle</li>
	<li>1x 4211398 - Plate 1X2</li>
</ul>

<p>The next is the four legs which have significantly very large feet to hold the model well when posing it and to remind us the sub-theme&rsquo;s exaggeration of proportions, which does help. I partially like how the legs are being held with the technic plates. The final assembly is adding the flick fire missiles which are placed in a suitable and open area unlike other particular sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Analysis / Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I absolutely adore this Microfighter model. It&rsquo;s a very unique addition to the Star Wars theme given that it&rsquo;s fully poseable as well being so cute and have a sense of character and emotion similar to the LEGO Creator animal models on a smaller scale. Even with those minor quibbles I mentioned it still feel it&rsquo;s not worth missing out. Therefore I would rank this first place as the best Microfighter LEGO has produced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Design: 10/10</strong> &ndash; The design and execution of the sub-theme makes this one cute and unique LEGO Star Wars product that you wouldn&rsquo;t normally find in the theme.</p>

<p><strong>Build: 7/10</strong> &ndash; The building experience is not very exciting however the use of SNOT and the assemblies of the limbs are very intriguing for new builders at such a &lsquo;small&rsquo; price.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure &ndash; 9/10</strong> &ndash; This AT-AT Driver variant is an outstanding design, one which is near perfect and a great successor over the last three variants.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: 9/10</strong> &ndash; Lack of the small ball joints takes away from movement in the head otherwise the playability for such a small set is outstanding!</p>

<p><strong>Parts: 7/10</strong> - Not prettiest parts selection as is with the most Star Wars models with all the greys however it does have multiples of different elements if you wanted to use them elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Price: 7/10</strong> - I don&rsquo;t agree with the prices of these Microfighters, for 88 pieces this is not really good value for money however the Minifigure and the concept of this particular model makes up for it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 9/10</strong> - Definitely everything a young kid would want, some small nit-picks may frustrate AFOL&rsquo;s, like me!</p>

<p>This set is currently available in stores and online, you still have a chance to pick one or more if you haven&rsquo;t already. Or if you already own one I would suggest picking up the &lsquo;75074 -&nbsp;Snowspeeder&rsquo; as the instructions encourage the customer to pair with this model. Great&nbsp;stocking filler for Christmas!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard for all Microfighter sets. &nbsp;2 internal bags. I wish they would have made the boxes big enough or the booklet small enough that they didn&#39;t have to fold the booklet in half. &nbsp;It&#39;s not creased, but it still annoys me for some reason.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Mostly standard pieces. &nbsp;I do love the the mechanism used to articulate the legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Minifigures</span></p>

<p>My favorite helmet of all the Microfighter sets. &nbsp;Underneath is an angry clone head.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Really enjoyed the build. &nbsp;Some of the other Microfighter sets were actually kind of&nbsp;boring. &nbsp;Not this one. &nbsp;I loved seeing the familiar form coming together.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Displays very well and cone be posed many ways with an articulating head and legs. &nbsp;The disk feat produce a&nbsp;very stable base even with 1-2 feet in the air. &nbsp;Another of my favorite features is the transparent red plate&nbsp;up front. &nbsp;With it being stacked on a 1x2 plate it makes the nobs look like eyes.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Again, my favorite Microfighter vehicle&nbsp;and minifigure, both in the same set. &nbsp;Pairs well with the Snowspeeder. To me, it is a great value for the price.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2020-05-28T05:03:21.99Z","Great Microfighter","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box 5.6 x 4.8 x 1.8 inches and weighs around 0.2 pounds. It comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any cool or unique parts in this set. You just get light and dark grey pieces in this set. The light grey dishes and medium dark grey dishes are nice to get. The total piece count for the set is 88.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>AT-AT Pilot:</strong></p>

<p>I was really happy to get this figure to add to my Star Wars collection. The pilot has the normal imperial trooper head. The detail on the helmet is great. The red imperial logo on either side of the top of the helmet&nbsp;looks amazing. The detail on the torso is well done. The respirator pack on the torso looks really good and there are tubes on the back from it. There is minor printing on his legs. Overall a great figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy, nothing to it. It took me under 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great microfighter. The walker itself is great. The head can move up and down. The walker is armed with two trans red flick missiles. The legs are really cool. You can adjust them so walker can be in a lot of different positions (Which I really like). The AT-AT Pilot is an amazing figure to get in this set. I highly recommend this set to add to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The AT-AT microfighter is (like the republic gunship) a good set with whacky proportions that work .</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>The AT-AT driver included is slightly updated in the 2020 75288 AT-AT but this figure is still sufficiently detailed with the TIE pilot / Inferno squad helmet used with printing everywhere in the face , the head is another......guess what......angry clone , the torso features a Darth Vader style control pad and some life support tubing and the legs are plain but at least it has printing , he does wield a single blaster pistol in black .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build has a nicely shaped head with a 1&times;2 trans red plate for the window , a modified 1&times;2 dark grey plate for underneath cannons and two light grey levers for side cannons , the body is quite bulky and features snot techniques on the sides using slopes and a hinge connection for the neck that has a restricted amount of articulation , the top has a spot for the driver to be perched and each side is gifted a flick fire missile , towards the end there is more sloping ,&nbsp;the very back has greebleing detail and the legs are identical and have motion at the top and at the feet which are comically large .&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good microfighter and in my opinion the 2021 remake looks nowhere near as good as this one but I suppose that is quite biased but I still recommend it .&nbsp;</p>
