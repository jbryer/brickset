<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This was my last purchase of the Series 2 microfighters and it falls solidly in the middle of the pack. Very good, but doesn&#39;t pack the same punch as the classics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tier 1 - AT-AT and Snowspeeder (buy together!)</p>

<p>Tier 2 - ARC-170 and Republic Gunship (both equally good)</p>

<p>Tier 3 - Vulture Droid and Homing Spider Droid (surprise, the droid vehicles are decent but still bland)</p>

"PooPotato","2015-02-16T17:35:50.943Z","The Microfighters Are Back With a Vengeance!","<p>The first wave of Microfighters didn&#39;t interest me at all, whether it be the vehicle design or the minifigure selection, they just didn&#39;t seem all that interesting. &nbsp;However, when the 2nd wave came around, I was very excited to get my hands on them. &nbsp;The vehicle selection was much more diverse, and it seems like these are meant to be bought in pairs, such as the Republic Gunship with the Homing Spider Droid, and the AT-AT with the Snowspeeder. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is of&nbsp;high quality like all of the new sets released this winter. &nbsp;It depicts the model flying over the Geonosis plains with a Droid Core ship taking off in the background. &nbsp;The instruction booklet was folded once down the middle, but it was easy to crease out the fold and open it like any other booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts for this set are very unique, and I&#39;m not entirely sure they would be useful for a MOC of any sort. &nbsp;One thing I&#39;d like to point out is the small 1x1 round tile with the Imperial symbol on it. &nbsp;Of course this vehicle wasn&#39;t used by the Imperials, but Lego did make a 1x1 round tile with the Republic symbol on it for 75006 Jedi Starfighter&nbsp;&amp; Kamino. &nbsp;It seems strange that they couldn&#39;t just use that design, but it really doesn&#39;t&nbsp;detract from the model from a whole.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure selection for this wave is much better, with the minifigures either being exclusive to their respective microfighter, or only being available with a much more expensive set, which was the case with this one. &nbsp;The Clone Trooper Pilot is easily one of my favorite minifigures, and the fact that he comes with printed legs only makes it better. &nbsp;I would like to get some more of these printed legs so I could replace all of the ones on my Phase I troopers. &nbsp;He looks fine piloting this Microfighter Gunship, but he looks even better co-piloting its much larger scale cousin. &nbsp;I might even have to buy another one of these so I have a pilot for my AT-TE...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was short and sweet, and nothing was too surprising. &nbsp;However, I do think I&#39;ve discovered a mistake in the instruction booklet. &nbsp;During the build, it calls for a 1x2 plate w/knob to be attached to 1x1 angular bricks. &nbsp;This is on the rear of the model, and if you have seen the Republic Gunship in any of its other forms, you would know that there is a rear turret on the vehicle. &nbsp;The instruction booklet never actually tells you to put an antenna on the back, though the model does come with a spare. &nbsp;I even looked at the part list in the back, and it says that the set only comes with two antennae. &nbsp;Luckily you are given a spare, so you can stick that antenna on the back and give your Microfighter a little extra defense.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is instantly recognizable, and it looks pretty cool next to the 75028 Clone&nbsp;Turbo Tank. &nbsp;The part selection&nbsp;used to obtain the sleek look of the Republic Gunship is great, with the open cargo bay and the bubble turrets all being included in some form.&nbsp;The play features are two flick fire missiles on both wing tips.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this model and I like the minifigure. &nbsp;I still hate dropping $10 for just one minifigure, but if the minifigure is hard to obtain or exclusive to its respective microfighter, it makes the burden easier to bear. I can actually see myself purchasing this entire wave in the near or present future, as long as it doesn&#39;t get in the way of me purchasing the UCS Slave I...</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Great model</p>

<p>Awesome minifigure</p>

<p>Play features (Gunship pairs with Spider Droid, flick fires etc.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Price is still a little steep</p>

<p>Not an entirely useful part selection</p>

"joemmo","2015-03-05T21:40:07.113Z","Republic Chunkship","<p>This wasn&#39;t on my top list of Microfighters to buy originally but I got the Clone Troopers vs Droidekas set as a present and though it would go nicely with those - seemed like a good excuse!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box art is good and the theme pairs it with the Homing Spider Droid from the Battle of Geonosis. Instructions do the job of course</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This kit really has a great mix of smaller parts including some curved plates and blocks,&nbsp;a good selection of SNOT pieces, 3x2 angled plates, wedges and&nbsp;studs. The specialist pieces are some printed studs with the Republic insignia on which was a nice detail. The engines use a variety of cylinders, cones and plain &#39;droid heads. There are hinged clips for the wings&nbsp;and a couple of lightsabre handles acting as a missile launcher. Its also nice to have some more colour in there with the white, dark red and little hints of green.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a standard clone pilot with the yellow marked helmet but he&#39;s pretty cool with printed legs and the mini-blaster.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As mentioned there are a lot of SNOT pieces in here and the build uses them to create the side of the ship and mount the engines on the wings. It was a quick but fun build with some nice touches.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model is pretty nice really although its one of the more exaggerated kits&nbsp;proportionally, even amongst the Microfighter series. There is a lot of detail packed in with clear studs representing the turret pods, antennas for the front guns and a clever use of the cheese wedges to get the distinctive tapered shape of the hull.</p>

<p>I do have a few&nbsp;issues with it though&nbsp;- the first is that the wings seem unneccesarily thick - 5 plates in fact which seems a bit too chunky. The wing angle is achieved by putting them on a hinge with a clip used to restrict the downward angle but they are still a bit flappy.&nbsp;My biggest gripe is that the build is just a little intolerant to how you pick it up. For a smaller child it is easy to ping off the side plates if they squeeze it a bit hard so its really one for more delicate handling.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;d probably rate is as #4 out of 6 in the series 2 SWMF sets. AT-AT and Snowspeeder&nbsp;joint top with ARC-170 in at 3, the droid sets&nbsp;aren&#39;t really grabbing me right now.</p>

<p>Despite my reservations over its robustness it&#39;s definitely cheaper and more swooshy than the big Gunship sets though&nbsp;and if you like a clone battle then its quite a fun set. As I wrote in the intro, this goes pretty well with the Clones v Droidekas set which has a Microfighter-ish&nbsp;style version of the command centre so maybe grab that and a Spider Droid and have a low budget mini battle!</p>

"vikings","2020-05-25T04:46:03.063Z","Republic Gunship","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 5.6 x 4.8 x 1.8 inches and weighs 0.22 pounds. Comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any really cool or unique parts in this set. You get two printed pieces in this set which are two studs with the Republic logo on it. Overall a pretty simple and basic part haul. The total piece count for the set is 105.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:</b></p>

<p><b>Clone Pilot:</b></p>

<p>This is a great figure to get. This isn&#39;t an overally common clone trooper and was really happy to get this figure. Comes with a normal clone head and is armed with a pistol. The helmet is great and has the classic yellow markings on it with red republic logo on either side of it. The torso has great printing of the pilot&#39;s respirator pack. The pilot also comes with printing on the legs as well which is really good. Overall this is a great figure to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me less than 10 minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty good microfighter. The clone pilot is a great figure to get in this set. The gunship itself is pretty good (A little bulky). The wings are a little thick (5 plates to be exact). I think if they were 3 plates thick it would be better. Other than that it has a great look to it. The wings are equipped with two trans green flick missiles. The engines look nice on the wings as well. The levers on the front represent some canons, and the clear studs on the side of the ship and on the wing represent the laser canons. The gunship doors are left open which I really like. I do recommend this microfighter to any Star Wars fan as it is a nice smaller scale of the republic gunship and getting the clone pilot adds to the set greatly. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a cardboard structure that houses the lego elements used to build the set pictured on the front. The instructions are located inside the box and are used to assist you in building the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are basic and are easily found throughout other sets but they are used extremely well to create the perfect look of a republic gunship. I like the way that the designers have used the R3 unit hed piece as I don&#39;t have any of them except those from this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The clone pilot included in this set is extremely detailed and looks very much like the real thing. But I have to say, I&#39;m not happy about the fact that the microfighters have only one &nbsp;minifigure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quick and it only took me 5 minutes to complete.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed &nbsp;model looks great on your shelf.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I think that this is a great set and I would definitely recommend it to you. I also think that it tires your fingers when trying to wtwrite a review for this set.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-11-26T19:46:13.073Z","Nice but phase one clone pilots need a change ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The republic gunship microfighter was my second of the sort and while the proportions are massively out of whack , I believe that they work well overall .</p>

<p>Minifigures -</p>

<p>The single figure of this standalone microfighter is an episode two phase one clone pilot the helmet features very accurate detail but is inaccurate in the way that it has the phase one fin when clone pilots have them absent , the head is the angry clone head.....yay , the torso features the appropriate fight suit detailing and the legs are simplistic and work for any phase one clone he wields a single blaster pistol as expected .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build , starting at the nose features two mirrored builds unsung a 1&times;1 lime green snot brick with a lever attached for the bubble turrets at the front of the craft in universe , the cockpit area features a 1&times;1 cheese slope as a windshield and a slot for the minifig , the sides feature a stud in stud assembly for the laser pods in each side below the 1&times;1 printed republic emblem , and a surprise slot to show an open troop bay with the open doors being represented with angled white plates at the very end , the back features a slope out then back up effect with the missile launchers on top represented with two light grey lightsaber hilts and the wings are identical in each side and feature the huge out of scale thrusters and a flick missile each .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>not the best but still good is hat I think of this but truth be told I would prefer a play scale&nbsp;&nbsp;one with clone wars Minifigures not the episode two version and if it was episode two they better change the helmet but overall I recommend it .</p>
