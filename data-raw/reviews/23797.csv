<p>On the small-size box you see an illustration of the battle droid riding the homing spider droid in what could be the battle of Geonosis (this is probable as Geonosis is the only official battle these participated in besides Felucia and that is a very flora-heavy planet and as such does not match the box art-work).</p>

<p>A small instruction booklet is included which has 27 numbered pages and 14 steps (not counting side-steps), it also has a parts-list and advertisement for the other <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Star-Wars/subtheme-MicroFighters"">Microfighters</a>&nbsp;along with some for the MicroFighters-app.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For the parts are included the droid-pieces (with an extra forward and sideways arm), a medium size blaster, a relatively large amount of small&nbsp;Technic pieces and also some corner pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A dark orange battle droid is included, it isn&#39;t the most exciting figure but it is nice to get a different variation on the regular battle droid.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself is quit fun although&nbsp;it is pretty repetitive as you have to build the legs 4 times.<br />
Some corner pieces are used to give the Homing Spider&nbsp;Droid &nbsp;a rounded look in the center.</p>

<p><br />
There is also a small seat space (2x4 brown tile) for the Battle Droid although without any studs to connect him.<br />
Also in-universe these Homing Spider Droids were not controlled by a Droid</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is quite accurate for its size and is actually pretty good looking.<br />
The pose-ability is limited to turning the 4 legs but not much more can be expected from a build this small.<br />
A single flick-fire missile is included on the lower part of the middle of the Homing Spider Droid.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This will probably be one of the less popular Microfighters but it is a good set in its own right with a good price/piece ratio and a fun little build.</p>
