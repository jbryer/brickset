"_add_um","2015-07-20T21:28:31.79Z","Highly recommended for any DC Comics fan!  ","<p>When Lego announced the DC Super Heroes line I was excited because it meant Lego would be able to finally expand the character catalog which so far had only been focused on Batman. However unsurprisingly due to his popularity, Batman remained the star of most of DC sets from 2012 to now (bar a handful of Superman sets). However 2015 changed things up finally and now I&#39;m glad to see Lego have finally made Justice League sets. Gorilla Grodd&nbsp;Goes Bananas&nbsp;is probably one of the best DC set Lego has done and I would highly recommend it especially&nbsp;if you&#39;re new to collecting them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art remains similar to previous years with the overall blue color and a hand drawn picture of the character(s) related to the set. It&#39;s nice to see Wonder Woman, Superman, The Flash&nbsp;and Green Lantern&nbsp;joining Batman&nbsp;on the box for once, indicating that is line is indeed a Justice League set. I should point in Europe the box art uses the yellow and black Batman symbol but in the US it uses the Justice League logo. I&#39;m not&nbsp;entirely sure why, maybe Justice League is more well know in America than it is in Europe? The set includes two instruction booklets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For fans who buy sets mostly for new and exclusive parts should be pleased with this set. There&#39;s a few trans-clear parts (from Wonder Woman&#39;s invisible jet) that I imagine are quite rare including a 1x1 brick with the stud&nbsp;on the side. Probably one of my favourite&nbsp;parts in the set is a Lego crate in a really nice creamy brown, a colour&nbsp;I haven&#39;t come across before. A net piece made out of fabric is also included is quite rare too. The set also has a super jumper but I would use these as they are know to damage minifigures legs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;included in this are probably the highlight for me and shouldn&#39;t disappoint.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With a new wave comes a new Batman minifigure, I&#39;ve lost track how many iterations Lego have done of the Dark Knight but for me I&#39;d say this is their best&nbsp;one yet. This version appears to be based&nbsp;off of&nbsp;the New 52&nbsp;Comics. The design and detail on Batman&#39;s armor is amazing, this Batman to new look notably ripped compared to the last ones, the muscles printed on the back look particularly&nbsp;imposing. It&#39;s nice to see Lego finally have given Batman new face printing too, one grimace looking face and the other just looks pissed off (which is awesome). It should also be noted the double sided head is printed on a black piece, this is due to the new cowl Lego have molded. The cowl includes shorter ears and lacks a chin strap thus the head is printed black so the chin and neck don&#39;t look off. Personally I love it and I think looks great. Finally a new spongy cape have been introduced this year and overall I like it, mainly due to the fact the cape doesn&#39;t crease like the older ones, only gripe is the fabric is noticeably thicker so it looks quite chunky, especially around the neck.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
An updated Wonder Woman is also included and like Batman; her look is inspired by the New 52 Comics. The double sided head piece is the only reused part from before. Even the hair piece has been re-coloured&nbsp;(now silver instead of gold). The printing on the legs was a very nice touch. She&#39;s armed with a generic sword (seen in the recent castle line).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Flash is only the minifigure seen from a previous set. However the figure is still great. It should be noted the helmet is made from a soft rubber material. The head is double sided too.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Captain Cold is completely new to the Lego DC line and is known for being one of The Flash&#39;s well known villains.&nbsp;He comes with a double sided face. I really like the use of the baby blue color on him. The new parka&nbsp;hood part is great. I like the freeze gun that he comes with too, despite it including the overused Galaxy Quest gun piece in the design.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Banana Truck Driver is a nice bonus in the set. It looks awful lot like a certain someone from Arrested Development. The head print is just a screaming face, though it doesn&#39;t include another face print which is disappointing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Finally, Gorilla Grodd; a big fig is another great addition to the set. Like previous big figs it has limited posebiltiy&nbsp;but overall he looks great. Printing on the head and feet really make&nbsp;him stand out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for this set will take you about 45 minutes to an hour. Parts are sorted out into number bags like many sets to make the building process easier and faster. The set also includes a few stickers but they should be no trouble.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks very nice. The Banana Truck is probably the best model in the set and would fit right in with any Lego city. The trailer and the canopy of the truck can be bend&nbsp;thanks to them being attached together via racketed joints.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Wonder Woman&#39;s Invisible&nbsp;Jet is very nice&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&#39;m just glad Lego finally got around to making one, despite it being a little under sized. But the rare trans-clear parts make up for&nbsp;its small size. It also includes those new spring loaded missiles&nbsp;on each wing, one of the missiles is used as a spare.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Batman&#39;s mech is in my opinion a bit clunky and awkward&nbsp;but it&#39;s nice to get a never done before Bat vehicle. The new super jumper&nbsp;is supposed to be attached to the cockpit area for Batman to stand on&nbsp;so he can fly out of the mech but I recommend not using the super jumper as I mentioned before of the damage they cause. The front of the mech does include a nice printed bat logo which does go well on the model. One of the arms includes a net launcher and two stud shooters, which comes with spare studs ammo. The bat wings are able to be posed in different directions but I think they model should had have them fixed in place.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, if you&#39;re a fan of the Super Heroes line, I very much recommend adding this to your collection. While the Bat-mech is a little under whelming the new minifigures make up for it.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T21:45:33.273Z","The Invisible Jet needs Work.","<p><strong>Set #76026 Gorilla Grodd goes Bananas: </strong>For 2015 DC Finally embraced the Justice League of America, and even then Batman still found a way to get loads of vehicles into existence. The also introduced a brand new cowl piece for Batman&rsquo;s head piece, this is one of the more fun sets from the first half of the year with some great villains and heroes, read on to find out why.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: Gone is the Batman logo on the box, now it&rsquo;s Justice League, and it still manages to have Batman front and centre when he&rsquo;s included in the sets. It&rsquo;s a really great action scene for the front while the back once again demonstrates all of the fun play features including that NEW Super Jumper!</p>

<p>Instructions: Once again there are two numbered manuals for this set which takes everything and breaks it up between a smaller manual for bag 1 and 2 which focuses on the smaller elements of the collection while the larger manual goes through the remaining numbered bags in a larger sized manual to build Batman&rsquo;s mech walker. As usual all of the steps are fairly straight forward in the build phase and are easy to follow along with.</p>

<p>At the back of the first manual are cross-promotional images of the Digital Media elements for LEGO DC, the larger of the two manuals shows the parts list. Pretty much standard at this point for LEGO Super Heroes sets. Of note there are a few small stickers for details, on a small sticker sheet which can easily be missed if not careful when removing everything from the box.</p>

<p>Comic: A simple silent issue with the LEGO sets from this first wave of Justice League inspired sets, and of course the figure checklist in the back. Brainiac Attacks is not represented here as it is a store exclusive, but every other scheme by the villains is represented in the comic in typical LEGO Brand humour.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>There is a great deal of parts in this set, the clear parts used on the Invisible Jet are fairly rare, especially the wings. There is also a nice constraction chestplate with the Bat symbol printed on it, probably the same one used in the Constraction set from 2012, but this time it&rsquo;s in the more traditional black colours. Overall a somewhat decent parts pack if you&rsquo;re looking for certain elements, though nothing exceedingly rare in large numbers I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Batman: Here&rsquo;s a brand new iteration of the Dark Knight, in his grey costume he&rsquo;s decked out with a great looking dual-sided torso print with a lot more musculature compared to earlier prints. He has a new softer goods cape that won&rsquo;t be damaged if left in a cockpit for too long and a brand new cowl piece. Now Batman&rsquo;s face is printed on a black head much like the Stormtroopers with a face visible surrounded by the black and the cowl is cut off so the chin of the head is now the chin of the cowl. This new look really stands out as being very LEGO for Batman, even more so than the previous look, which being updated now after so many years of existing a certain way is definitely a great decision. He has no accessories.</p>

<p>Captain Cold: One of The Flash&rsquo;s Rogue&rsquo;s, Captain Cold is an excellent Minifigure choice with some great printing, he has a very interesting cold weather jacket print that is double-sided with fur lining the collar and a new head piece with a fur covered hood. His face is double-sided as well with a triumphant looking expression and a nervous angry looking expression as if he&rsquo;s being defeated.</p>

<p>His accessory is a brick built cold gun, different from Mr. Freeze&rsquo;s design, this one is using a space gun with a pair of binoculars on the end, a clip piece and some other elements. Overall a nice looking weapon.</p>

<p>Gorilla Grodd: Using a bigfig design Gorilla Grodd includes some nice printing, especially for his mind control helmet (though it&rsquo;s more like a head marking the way the print makes it look) and he has no real accessories. He&rsquo;s got some nice toe printing on the mold though to indicate he&rsquo;s a gorilla, and the head sculpt looks very nice too.</p>

<p>The Flash: No accessories for The Flash, he uses his speed to defeat his enemies and so doesn&rsquo;t need any weapons. This figure has the exact same print as the one seen in The Riddler Chase in 2014. It&rsquo;s a great print which captures the look of the character very well, his head piece is a softer plastic, almost rubbery. He has a dual-sided facial print with a happy expression and an angry expression.</p>

<p>Truck Driver: It&rsquo;s a regular citizen in Central City, or Coast City, or whatever city you want. This character has a great looking torso with a fun looking banana logo on the front of the overalls and the Banana Co. name on the back. Unfortunately he only has one terrified expression so I guess he&rsquo;s always very nervous when delivering his bananas. No accessories, unless you count all of the bananas in the back.</p>

<p>Wonder Woman: New 52 Wonder Woman has an all new print with her New 52 costume, instead of gold she now has silver highlights to her costume and a silver tiara, she&rsquo;s also carrying a sword for her accessory. Her facial expressions are the same as the original release, aside from her costume print on her legs and torso she&rsquo;s pretty much the same as the past figure when it comes to looks.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Bag 1: Consisting of most of the Minifigures from the set and the Bigfig there isn&rsquo;t much work in this bag for the build, the majority of which is the small little banana delivery truck that Gorilla Grodd is pursuing. A very quick and easy build, the only part younger builders might need any help with is the placement of the stickers on the vehicle&rsquo;s doors.</p>

<p>Bag 2: It&rsquo;s Wonder Woman and her invisible jet in this bag and the build here is another quick one, with very simple steps to follow along with. The build here is pretty clever as it uses mostly clear bricks and plates to make an invisible jet. Really stands out as one of the fun builds from the wave.</p>

<p>Bag 3: Batman begins building his Bat Mech with this bag, follow along with the step-by-step build which has you constructing the central torso of the mech, you&rsquo;ll also find a Super Jumper in here, there isn&rsquo;t any difficult moments during this build from what I can recall and if you&rsquo;ve built LEGO mechs before there won&rsquo;t be anything really new to see here as far as techniques go.</p>

<p>Bag 4: Build the arms and the legs of Batman&rsquo;s massive muscle enhancing mecha and feel a tad repetitious as you do so, why? Well you&rsquo;re building an asymmetrically designed set of legs and arms, the lower hip area is also covered here. The hardest element may be fitting the net into the net launching device that Batman has constructed into his suit for capturing Gorilla Grodd.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Invisible Jet: This model looks like an invisible jet, or as close to one as you can get with LEGO bricks. It includes two launching missiles to fire on the villains and two big flame pieces in blue for an exhaust. It&rsquo;s really an interesting model, though I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the biggest treat from the set, that relies more on the next model we&rsquo;ll discuss.</p>

<p>Bat Mech: To fight powerful enemies Batman needs a powerful suit of armour, this mech is akin to Iron Man&rsquo;s Hulk Buster, it&rsquo;s a big bruiser of a mech with some great design cues. The cockpit is designed to be open so you can have Batman control the thing while attached to the super jumper. For weapons he has two stud launchers and a large net launcher on his right arm, with the left arm being a very nicely designed hand with four fingers.</p>

<p>The legs include two thrusters for added thrust when Batman leaps into battle, and all of the joints work quite nicely as a mech design, you can get a lot of fun dynamic poses out of this when playing or displaying.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous: Basically this is a very nice looking little delivery truck and really is more of an accessory for Gorilla Grodd because he can tear the thing in half, pick it up to steal the crate, or rip open the driver&rsquo;s section to get at the driver as a hostage. It&rsquo;s pretty much a fun little side model.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I am very impressed by this set, as a Justice League set it lives up to the expectations by including a lot of fun figures, not just Batman oriented, though Batman does take up majority as his mech uses far more pieces than any other model in the set. The invisible plane is a model that could use a bit of tweaking to truly make it stand out more, I&rsquo;m not a fan of the odd wing design for it truth be told, and the size is a bit smaller than I was expecting for a jet.</p>

<p>All in all though this set is a worthy addition to any DC fans collection and it features some great models, great Minifigures and great overall price-per-piece ratio. This is a set I would strongly recommend.</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-20T00:35:19.57Z","Gorilla Grodd Goes Bananas Review","<p>The&nbsp;Gorilla Grodd Goes Bananas set is a DC Superheroes set that isn&#39;t that good. It includes Batman&#39;s mech, Wonder Woman&#39;s invisible jet, a banana truck, 5 minifigures, and a bigfig. It was released in 2015 for&nbsp;$49.99 and has 347 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Batman- </strong>This version of Batman is in a gray suit and is the main Batman minifigure for 2015. He is in a total of 4 sets and has decent printing. 7/10</p>

<p><strong>Wonder Woman-</strong> Is a nice new version of Wonder Woman similar to the one in 2012 but this one has silver on it instead of gold. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>The Flash-</strong>&nbsp;This version of The Flash is the same exact one from 2014 but is still a nice addition. 8/10</p>

<p><strong>Captain Cold- </strong>This is a nice new villain minifigure we have never gotten before. He has good printing and a double sided face. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Truck Driver- </strong>This is a basic civilian&nbsp;minifigure which isn&#39;t needed but is still nice to get. He has cool exclusive printing. 7/10</p>

<p><strong>Gorilla Grodd-</strong> A nice new bigfig to get for a cool character we have never gotten. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Batman&#39;s mech is build I don&#39;t like that much. Its nice to get but doesn&#39;t look that good. It has nice articulation and a canon that can shoot a net with stud shooters on top. The mech is great for playability but I don&#39;t think it looks that good. Wonder Woman&#39;s jet is small but still a nice inclusion to the set. It is made with mostly clear pieces to show that it is supposed to be invisible. It has 2 spring loaded shooters which are good for playability. The banana truck is not needed but is a cool addition. It has a crate of bananas on the back and can be folded to make it look like Gorilla Grodd is destroying it. 6/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set has decent minifigures with alright builds. Personally I don&#39;t like the mech but if you do&nbsp;that is ok it is your opinion. This set has great play features which are good for kids. It doesn&#39;t look that great on display though.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
