"Novelty","2007-03-31T12:14:41.393Z","Rock, Paper, Scissors","One would have to wonder why would a vehicle on skis be required in a mine.  This vehicle just doesn't seem to make sense in this theme and like 4910 seems to be in the theme only to provide a small set for the theme.  It has the neon-yellow crystal and is the smallest set to include the 2-piece hollow rock which makes this set another good one to get spares.  The other nice piece is the container at the back of the vehicle.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

I assembled it at home first thing, I'd not known LEGO had existed before. A great first set, there were so many possibilities to make different vehicles. If you can get one of these, its worthwhile.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zinkk757","2007-07-26T17:44:01.847Z","5/5 not bad","this rock raiders set is my favorite next to the tunnel transport.  i got it when it came out, and liked it a lot.  the minifigure is cool and has a BLACK! hardhat which is very useful for custom minfigures.  the vehicle is incredable and has everything a vehicle really needs in tunnels and on the ice.  the skiis are cool too.  it has some accesories for cutting open the boalder it comes with and the usuall crystal.  overall it has only one flaw and that would be that the rock doesn't fit very well in the dumpster in the back of the vehicle.  besides that poor feature, this set rocks and you should get it right away.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:21:29.717Z","Great set - great price!","The Rapid Rider is cool, in size, price and the extra stuff that comes with the set. When collecting Rock Raiders years ago it was a no brainer to add this one (in fact I own 2). This little set is the workhorse to the mining operation, gets the men where they need to go with the tools needed to complete the job.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-10-20T00:01:36.14Z","A Small Set That Has It All!","This is one of those few vehicles that to look at has it all. The vehicle is equipped to take on it's harsh environment. The shape is very aesthetically pleasing and very sturdy for something that looks so fragile. The ski's on the bottom are obviously for the under ground rivers it travels on, like in the picture and the reason why its called &quot;Rapid Rider&quot;. To a lesser extent it could travel on lava and mud. To make it move the jets on either side do that with ease. It has room to attach all your mining gear and a nice size tray to carry things. Nice big spot lights on the front and control panel to steer. This model has been very well thought out. My favorite part is the piece at the front. It is printed on NO STICKER so this model gets another plus.

The mini-fig is a general workman with blue pants, red shirt, green vest and a black hard hat. He has a hand saw for cutting rocks in half and viewfinders for analyzing what he has found. Also the boulder spits in half to reveal a fluorescent energy crystal.

The two little let downs with this model are the tray at the back. If you don't remove the rock raiders symbol the boulder rolls around and falls out quite easily. The other thing I would have liked to have seen the tray on a hinge to dump its contents back at base.

Overall it is a fantastic little set an I feel this one is a 9/10. It could have been a ten but the flaws let it down too much for this little model. Still a great set and well worthy of any collection. Please make the time to find this little gem if you don't already have one.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-23T17:00:35.187Z","Great set, but out of place","Since this set is the only real watercraft in the series it takes away from the use for the vehicle, especially for those who have not played the game. This set would have made a 5/5 it it was more expensive and came with a replica of the docks; sort of a mini playset, maybe a small baseplate with some water... As a set this is pretty good, since unlike the Hover Scout, this one has a rock (ore) adding to the playability. This set would also have recieved a 5/5 if there had also been a Cargo Carrier set (this is one of the vehicles that was only in the game) which included another Small Transport Truck or something, but if you have some of the other sets you can make them, though. The set has all it needs, but since the only other set released that could bind this to the series was the Tunnel Transport (the really big helicopter for those who don't already know). All in all a great set, with plenty of playability and tools, except that it is the only water craft in the series to be released.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Ben_r_l","2009-01-20T11:56:12.983Z","Underground watercraft? yes please!","This small set was a great addition to the Rock Raider theme, providing our underground friends access to a series of underground streams in order to dig up those precious crystals! The set comes with a cool 'bandit' minifigure and some tools to help him cut open the rock! the Rapid rider itself looks build for speed and agility and is great to include in chases. However I recommend getting two as without another water based vehicle in the theme life can get a little lonely down there...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KX","2017-11-30T02:29:40.99Z","Rapid Build. Rapid Fun?","<p>I have this set when I was 6 (and is still alive &amp; complete!).&nbsp; I had fun memories with it. It wasn&#39;t the most flashy Lego that I had but using my imagination made this set worthwhile.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>You get 3 printed pieces: the Rock Raiders symbol, the console, and the green &quot;cockpit&quot; piece.&nbsp; The RR symbol can be used for MOC&#39;s but the other two are a bit generic.&nbsp; The body base of the rider is unique to this set (if I&#39;m not mistaken) and can be quite useful to make MOC&#39;s about mining or so.</p>

<p>Build Experience</p>

<p>It is a simple build but it is quite stable.&nbsp; There was a time I memorized the instructions due to its brevity. You can also build this set just by looking at the packaging.</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>1999 was the time that Lego had the slogan &quot;Just imagine&quot;.&nbsp; This set didn&#39;t disappoint. I played with it often using stories in my head and had fun with it.&nbsp; It didn&#39;t have other minifigs or action features like the Lego&#39;s of today but it is still, in my opinion, great old school fun.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>If you like some old school small build fun, this set is for you.&nbsp; The minifig is also not that &quot;old&quot; looking when placed with newer minifigs of today. (So it is still quite useful)</p>

<p>If you see this set somewhere (like garage sales or similar), it&#39;s a no-brainer to get it for yourself. Just make sure the price point is fair of course.</p>

<p><em>4920</em>&nbsp;is the joint-smallest set in the <em>Rock Raiders&nbsp;</em>range, featuring only 39 parts, and a single minifigure, making it reasonable value back in the day. The question is, how does it stack up today?</p>

<p>When remembering the&nbsp;<em>Rock Raiders</em>&nbsp;theme, <i>4920</i>&nbsp;is unlikely to be the first set your mind jumps to, but it did add some nice variety to the range beyond bulky land-based mining equipment. Despite being such a small model, though,&nbsp;<em>4920</em>&nbsp;manages to continue the disappointing&nbsp;<em>Rock Raiders&nbsp;</em>theme of oversized, overspecialised parts, with most of the vehicle&#39;s&nbsp;construction consisting of the single helicopter sled rails, dark grey footpad plate and the tipper bed. Still, it&#39;s a fairly interesting design, resembling more of a catamaran than a regular boat, though the jet thrusters are an... inspired choice.</p>

<p>Other than the boat itself, we get another ubiquitous boulder and trans-green crystal&nbsp;- remember when seemingly every space theme centred around some precious mineral, encased in some kind of boulder? - as well as a pair of macrobinoculars and a buzzsaw, giving this small set some decent play potential.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Bandit is the real standout of this set. The detail on his torso holds up even today, featuring a deep green utility vest over a red sweater, and goes nicely with the plain blue parts, though the lack of back printing is a shame. It&#39;s a versatile piece, one that could be used in all manner of mechanic or technical figs you might dream up, and the same goes for the headpiece, featuring a full stubble, matching bushy eyebrows and a bandanna, making it a shame these elements hardly appeared outside of the&nbsp;<em>Rock Raiders&nbsp;</em>theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re collecting&nbsp;<em>Rock Raiders</em>, none of these detriments will put you off this set - honestly, you probably have it already. Otherwise, if these minifig&nbsp;elements sound like just what you&#39;re looking for, but you aren&#39;t interested in adding a construction rocket sled to your collection, then perhaps it&#39;s best just tracking down these parts on Bricklink.&nbsp;</p>
