"Harmonious_Building","2015-02-14T20:52:14.42Z","Doing justice to DC? ","<p>As far as DC fans go, I am about as casual as they come. I was very much into the landmark&nbsp;<em>Batman: The Animated Series&nbsp;</em>when I was a kid, I&#39;ve seen some of the movies, and I&#39;ve read a few of the comics, mostly thanks to other family members being far more into DC than I ever was (&quot;Make Mine Marvel&quot; for me). All I can say is that I have a cursory knowledge of the major players in the DC Universe, and it is on this basis that I review this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For anyone who has been following LEGO&#39;s relatively new Superhero license, it&#39;s rarely a stretch for sets to be of the &quot;come for the minifigs, stay for build&quot; ilk, and it is on the strength of the build that the overall package generally lies in terms of being worth your time and money. For DC fans, I can imagine that this is even more so, since the overwhelming majority of DC-related minifigs&nbsp;thus far have been Batman, Batman, Batman, and more Batman, to the point where even major characters like the Flash and Aquaman have been insultingly shoehorned into smaller Batman sets of dubious quality (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76012-1/Batman-The-Riddler-Chase"">76012</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76000-1/Arctic-Batman-vs-Mr-Freeze-Aquaman-on-Ice"">76000</a> respectively; the former is particularly insulting since the Flash&#39;s name isn&#39;t even in the title). 2015 has changed all that, and with the possibility of a Justice League movie being (supposedly) on the horizon, LEGO and DC have undoubtedly decided to jumpstart marketing efforts by turning at least some of the spotlight on the rest of its colourful pantheon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And what a fine selection we have here. Superman is undoubtedly the most famous of the lot, but he&#39;s not exactly exciting since he&#39;s appeared several times before, not to mention in at least two iterations. The Man of Steel, though, is in good company, and I imagine that even folks who are not at all interested in DC or superheroes will find the minifigs intriguing for MOC reasons. Hawkman&#39;s wings are of&nbsp;the new punch-out, transparency style, attached to his body via an incredibly useful trans-piece that I can see an incredible amount of use for. Cyborg&nbsp;has a sweet futuristic headpiece and is sure to delight builders into scifi/dystopian builds, as well as those looking for more generic &quot;dark toned&quot; heads to use. The least exciting among the good guys is probably Green Arrow, though those who find themselves amused by the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(TV_series)""><em>Arrow</em></a> television melodrama may find him desirable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanos...er, I mean,&nbsp;Darkseid is one of several new &quot;bigfigs&quot; out this year, and while their use is apparently not wholly accepted in the LEGO community, I personally think that they provide a nice bit of variety as far as character depictions go. He&#39;s certainly an evolution - if only a small one - compared to the Hulk from three years ago, with a lot of nice printed details on his torso and head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not unexpectedly, there&#39;s two builds here: a smaller vessel of sorts for Darkseid and a ship for the Justice League to fly around in (I don&#39;t know if it has a name or not). Darkseid&#39;s&nbsp;little vessel is a pretty hilarious example of &quot;toy logic&quot; running completely contrary to &quot;comic book logic&quot; - according to the DC wikia, <a href=""http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Uxas_(New_Earth)#Powers_and_AbilitiesEdit"">Darkseid</a> is basically a god, with powers that run the gamut from immortality (!!!) to altering the very fabric of space and time itself. Yet, inexplicably, he needs a little floating platform here from which he can fire gumballs at disgusting do-gooders. Obviously kids won&#39;t think too much about this, but I personally find it pretty funny. It&#39;s not a terribly remarkable build, and the instructions feature an odd mistake in which Darkseid is printed in an impossible position, cutting into the 1 x 2 black wedge pieces instead of being properly placed on the jumper plates as designed. I suppose since Darkseid is capable of manipulating matter itself, trivial details like illegal LDD placements are of no concern to him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking frankly, I wasn&#39;t too interested in the Justice League jet thing from the outset, but it both surprised me (in a good way) and also confirmed other thoughts (in a bad way). What I liked most was the angular construction in the front, and it&#39;s not obvious at all from the pictures, but the way it&#39;s put together is actually pretty unexpected, and I definitely did appreciate the geometry that went into its design. Conversely, the wings and rear of the ship are just not very attractive - unlike the beautiful Milano (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76021-1/The-Milano-Spaceship-Rescue"">76021</a>) which is streamlined from top to bottom, the jet just feels unfinished at the back. The wings are flat, the rear doesn&#39;t taper nicely or feature any interesting greebling, and there aren&#39;t even that any real stand-out features that would make it playable. It&#39;s possible that not personally having a frame of reference for what the ship is supposed to be is affecting my opinion, and in my defence, I can only say this: I had no idea what the Milano was supposed to look like either outside of a second and a half shot from a teaser video, and I still thought it looked absolutely gorgeous from the moment the first pictures of the LEGO version hit the web.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I managed to pick up this set for around 20% off, and I do not think that I can justify buying it at retail price. The minifigs are outstanding - especially for a DC aficionado - and the parts selection is quite solid - lots of useful tiles, trans-blue bricks, curved pieces, and relatively few &quot;specialised&quot; (I hate using that adjective) parts that will occupy space in your &quot;unsortable&quot; bin. However, the presence of a bigfig and the usual markup for being a licensed set make the price hard to swallow. If you&#39;re into superheroes, try and find it on discount. Otherwise, I would say there are better introductions to the theme.&nbsp;</p>

"Mirakle","2015-04-19T18:37:11.51Z","A beautiful spaceship with a good bunch of super heroes","<p>I was really anticipating this set mainly for the ship (The Javelin) and Darkseid. It turns out that the spaceship is awesome (longer than 30 cm) and the selection of super heroes is varied.</p>

<p>Darkseid is like I imagined him: &nbsp;a good&nbsp;opponent for Superman or Hulk in a cross-over between DC/Marvel.</p>

<p>The outcome is pretty good and will fit very well in my large collection of spacecraft.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A big box (a&nbsp;bit smaller than&nbsp;the one for the 2015 Quinjet) with 3 booklets (3 different sizes which is quite weird).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Apart from the minifigs, there is a wide range of white parts. In particular some&nbsp;long white profiled slopes that give the Javelin an awesome curved shape.</p>

<p>I notice a new kind of gear wheels (10928) as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>To me Cyborg is clearly the best minifig of the set with new&nbsp;designs on his legs and torso. His helmet is very good too giving him a Terminator like appearance.</p>

<p>Hawkman is a completely new minifig&nbsp;with the new way of forming the wings: two sets of thin plastic&nbsp;wings (folded and unfolded).</p>

<p>Green Arrow is not particularly noteworthy for me, though I&#39;m pleased to get another new character.&nbsp;Superman has the new soft cloak but is otherwise the same as the earlier version.</p>

<p>To finish, Darkseid is pretty accurate even if bigfigs&nbsp;are&nbsp;still controversial among&nbsp;AFOLs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I built the set in about 1h30. The focus of the set is the Javelin where one can find some remarkable building techniques. To me the nose of the ship was really a surprise, using techniques I have not seen before.</p>

<p>Darkseid&#39;s small vessel is of little interest.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Even without stickers (I don&#39;t&nbsp;use&nbsp;them), the Javelin is a beautiful spaceship. The front is nice to see with an attractive curved shape. In contrast, the back is a bit disappointing as the jet engine is not very detailed.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As the flagship of the DC sets this year, this set is not disappointing but may be too expensive given the number of parts.</p>

<p>Anyway, the ship is worth having. I like the set but would recommend&nbsp;waiting for its price to lower.</p>

"Fauch","2015-09-23T00:46:06.31Z","sleek and swooshable","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>the part selection isn&#39;t particularly impressive but contains some nice pieces, in particular transparent ones, like the 7 1x2 trans blue bricks, the 3 6x6 trans light blue radar dishes or the 4 trans red donuts. I also like the 4 3x12 white slopes. the trans blue canopy and the dark grey one are unique to this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Darkseid is my first big fig. basically it is a 4x6 wide fig and stands about 7 studs high. Printing on it is quite average. it is mostly blue, black and grey, and only the torso and head receive some detailing. Only the arm and hands are articulated, the same way as minifigs. The hands act as clips, but can also hold 1 stud wide bricks.</p>

<p>Superman is the only fig I&#39;m actually familiar with. It has back printing and double sided face with a neutral side and a smiling one. Expected him to have the laser eyes like general Zod but nope. The printing is simple, but given the source material, not sure more needed to be done. The model is missing the red boots, probably because dual molded legs didn&#39;t exist yet. The cloak is a very nice material, much softer and flexible than the old cloak and actually feels like a cloth and not like paper.</p>

<p>Green arrow has back printing with a quiver and a double sided face with a neutral and an angry side. It has a hoodie which goes over his quiver, which doesn&#39;t look very practical for fighting. A hood piece to go over his head should be included. The hair don&#39;t fully cover the alternate face and you can still see the bottom of the jaws.</p>

<p>Cyborg is a metallic looking minifig with prints on front and&nbsp;back of torsos and legs. He is very nicely detailed. He has a double sided face with a happy and an angry side. The helmet is kinda disappointing has it doesn&#39;t appear to have a metallic texture (actually the inventory says the contrary, but it doesn&#39;t look very silver to me)&nbsp;and looks like cyborg put on a toy helmet. Also, I suppose the black part is meant to be hair, though doesn&#39;t look very much like it.</p>

<p>Hawkman has prints on front and back of torsos and on legs and a double sided face with an angry and a very angry side. Pretty nice printings. the legs and hands have the gold textures. The helmets makes me think of a bird since it has wings. It is also in a gold texture. Wings are made of a thin plastic, they look good, though have no reliefs and can be bent easily.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the build isn&#39;t particularly complicated and contains a few nice technics, like the build of the nose and some simple technic bits. The mechanics for raising the wings is interesting as well, very simple actually.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Darkseid small platform is nothing special, but it contains a few nice pieces, like the radar dishes, cannon, and 2 silver dome pieces.</p>

<p>The javelin is a very sleek looking model, measuring 36cm long and 20 cm wide. It looks very good, especially seen from above, as the lower half, while clean looking, is nothing special. It has a very large cockpit which can accommodates the 4 minifigs, with their weapons and cloak, though wings will get bent.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The model is very swooshable, easy to grab, sturdy, and not too heavy. It has flick missiles on the bottom which are a bit awkward to reach. The design of the ship would have allowed for spring loaded shooters, so it&#39;s a bit weird. At the rear of the javelin there is a lever to raise and lower the wings which works just fine. Above it, the press of a button will pop the top of the ship wide open and is a function which works perfectly as well. Inside the ship, there is a red button used to apply pressure on the super jumper, now I&#39;m not sure about the super jumper as I get pretty random results with it and it doesn&#39;t go very far when I use the red button. It is widely said that it cracks minifigs legs, so I tried with an old ruined one. There is also a trap on the bottom you can use to release bombs.</p>

<p>darkseid cannon is powerful, and could break the weak pieces of a model. Darkseid is barely balanced on his platform, and an impact of moderate strength can make him fall, but he will be quite secure if he holds the lever.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This a pretty nice model, good looking and very swooshable. I&#39;m not sure how to efficiently use&nbsp;the super jumper. The RRP is at least 15&euro; too much.</p>

<br />
Today, I&#39;m here to talk about and review Set #76028, Darkseid Invasion. I picked this up off of EBay a few years back, and figured now was a good time to talk about it, what with the lack of DC sets being released in recent times.</font></font><br />

<font color=""#222222""><font size=""2"">This set comes with four minifigures, and a unique Darkseid bigfig. Only one of the four minifigures is technically unique.

<p align=""left"">&nbsp;</p>

<p align=""left""><font color=""#222222""><font size=""2"">Now let&rsquo;s talk about the bread and butter of this set, The Javelin. The build perfectly captures the look of the Javelin from the Justice League show that I personally grew up with in the early 2000s, so it was quite nostalgic to build. The actual building experience was great. I think my favorite part was figuring out what the Technic Mechanism was going to do, as you start building it quite early, and I enjoy figuring out what it is that I am building and how it&rsquo;s going to work when I build Technic. They have done a phenomenal job shaping the nose of the ship. I always appreciate when designers use hinges to make subtle curves on the front end of a ship.<br />
Surprisingly, I also really liked the stickered shield with the JL logo on it.</font></font></p>

<p align=""left""><font color=""#222222""><font size=""2""><u><b>SIDE BUILD</b></u></font></font></p>

<p align=""left"">&nbsp;</p>

<p align=""left""><font color=""#222222""><font size=""2"">Now, the side build, I feel, is particularly weak. I think they could have worked a little harder on the function/detail, or either dropped the pieces from the count and set all together, improving the value a little bit. Playability is there with the wing function for a landing mode or flight mode, and the back of the javelin has a super jumper function. You can change the wings for hawkman as well, which is a nice touch on an already unique minifigure. </font></font><br />
<br />
<font color=""#222222""><font size=""2""><u><b>TL;DR</b></u></font></font></p>

<p align=""left"">&nbsp;</p>

<p align=""left""><font color=""#222222""><font size=""2"">The main build is definitely well worth it alone, and the shortcomings (Lack of unique figures, mediocre side build) are easily forgiven because of this. I hope this helps anyone looking to buy one in the future, I would definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoyed the Justice League show growing up, or are just a fan of LEGO/Super Heroes.</font></font></p>
