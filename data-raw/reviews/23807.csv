"Skut","2015-07-15T03:19:52.53Z","A great car that does not look like a Ferrari","<p>Let&#39;s get one thing straight from the start.&nbsp; With the possible exception of the Porsche 911, the Speed Champions cars do not look like the real cars they are based on.&nbsp; However as you will see, that doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 458 Italia GT2 is a case in point.&nbsp; Nothing that looked like this model ever came out of the prancing horse factory.&nbsp; The overall lines of the car are much more like a modern Ford Mustang or other muscle car.&nbsp; The impression is more of a WRC car than a GT - perhaps Lego could bring out a line of WRC cars or Nascars with more realism, given the geometry of the brick?</p>

<p>However despite the above limitations,&nbsp;the ground-hugging bodywork, clever use of SNOT and offset building techniques and&nbsp;part colours make this an eminently cool car - indeed the 2015 Race Champions sets are the best minifig-scale racing cars TLG has produced so far.&nbsp; The only parts limitation (common across this year&#39;s Race Champions sets) seems to be a propensity to use stickers for headlights rather than brick-built ones.&nbsp; Indeed there are lots of stickers in this set full stop, so this is not a set for you if you&#39;re a member of the anti-sticker brigade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This 458 looks particularly intimidating as it roars down the main street of your city, leaving the poor pathetic City police cars in its dust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buy it for the play value, colours and parts.&nbsp; Don&#39;t buy it if you want a Lego car that looks like a Ferrari.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Looks absolutely fabulous</li>
	<li>The stickers really add to the set, and I can count on the fingers of one hand how many times I&#39;ve said that about a LEGO set.</li>
	<li>A complicated and interesting build for its size.</li>
	<li>The final build is surprisingly and satisfyingly weighty.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Doesn&#39;t quite fit in with other city vehicules due to the slightly larger size.</li>
	<li>A lot of stickers - if you dislike placing them or don&#39;t stick them for fear of warping, you are going to end up with a really boring looking car :(</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>This lived up to and surpassed my expectations. The piece selection is fantastic with a lot of nice plates, curves and SNOT pieces, and the build itself is interesting with a few unusual building techniques. The double SNOT brackets to create the downward facing tiles between the wheels is nothing short of&nbsp;elegant because of its simplicity. The stickers, while generally a much-hated part of my sets, work extremely well here, and the final model feels like a real, sponsored-to-the-hilt race car. Overall this set oozes quality.</p>

<p>In terms of building it, it was relatively straightforward. Well it was my 7 year old son who was building it and he had no problems at all. The only challenge were the stickers. There were quite a few and some quite technical.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyways, the car does look beautiful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I guess at the end of the day, the price of this was a tad high. I guess its all to do with the sponsorships and Ferrari-related stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All-in-all, a good set.&nbsp;</p>
