"ShauvonM","2016-03-15T19:14:20.697Z","Finally someone is cleaning up the seedier neighborhoods of Lego City","<p>Look, you can&#39;t deny that Lego City has some problems. It seems like 40% of the buildings in town are some sort of Burglar Hideout.&nbsp;There are more forms of public transportation than there are citizens, and still everyone owns a car. The police do nothing but catch the same guy over and over again, apparently guilty of nothing more than repeatedly attempting escape. The fire department has an absurdly slow response time, probably because the roads are all clogged with other fire trucks. There&#39;s literally one ambulance (if you&#39;re lucky) and no hospital. Sure they have a recycling pickup, but public awareness of what can be recycled&nbsp;is laughable (why is the recycling bin always full of fish?). Most of the buildings don&#39;t even have four walls to them. There is only one train station, and the line just goes in a big circle around the city (not to mention the track can only safely&nbsp;be crossed in one spot). The list goes on and on.</p>

<p>Perhaps worst of all is that particular part of town that nobody wants to talk about. Don&#39;t deny it - you know you drive a little faster in that neighborhood. You would lock your car doors if your car doors could be locked. You try not to think about it, but there it is - a blight on the otherwise pristine Lego City skyline.&nbsp;However, thanks to some forward thinking city planning - and it&#39;s about time, too - the Lego City government is finally doing something about that expanse of abandoned facades and rogue toilets that are still hooked up to water for some reason. Enter the Lego Demolitions Department, centering on this fleet of cutting edge tools of dismantlement.</p>

<p>In case you happen to live in the real world, and not the precise plastic paradise of Lego City, 60076: Demolition Site is a great set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is, well, a box. Not much more can be said. It has a cool picture on the front, some dude yelling &quot;hey&quot; on the back, and some tape holding it shut - as are the customs lo these last few years.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/6rT20Y5.png"" style=""width: 280px; height: 500px;"" /><br />
<i>If I was holding a Lego box and then it fell open and everything fell out of it perfectly into place, I would probably say something other than &quot;Hey!&quot;</i></p>

<p>The instructions are likewise of the tried and true multi-volume style that you are certainly used to if you have any other Lego City sets. This set is divided into four parts - one for each of the included vehicles, and one for the very necessary building which needs to be demolished. Since Lego seems to be migrating to a new, single volume, more &quot;book-like&quot;&nbsp;style of instruction, this style of instruction binding could be going the way of, well, the building in this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The demolition site contains quite a few fun pieces. The front&nbsp;end&nbsp;loader (a particular favorite of 8 year old me) has a big shovel piece, the dump truck has a big dump truck piece, and the big wrecking ball crane has a, well, big wrecking ball piece. Don&#39;t forget that you get plenty of tread pieces, some (perhaps uncommon?)&nbsp;windshield parts,&nbsp;and the big technic pin style wheel hubs (for some reason&nbsp;a particular favorite of 30 year old me). You also get a wheelbarrow and a trash can,&nbsp;which is nowhere near big enough to contain all the trash once you take the building apart, let&#39;s face it, a handful of red brick and brown pieces in case you want to make your own ugly structure&nbsp;that needs&nbsp;a good demolishing, and plenty of yellow parts for your Totally-Not-Catarpillar Brand vehicles. There are&nbsp;a few dynamite pieces which you know are just going to end up falling into the hands of local criminals, and finally there&#39;s also, oh good, another brick separator for your pile of those. To be fair, though, that brick separator is the only&nbsp;actual demolition tool in the set, so I guess it&#39;s good that they threw one in. Many of the parts are kind of specific to construction (or, I suppose, the opposite of that) vehicles, so if you&#39;re looking to make, I don&#39;t know, a race car or something I guess you can pass this set&#39;s selection of parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t think this is in any way a set for Minifigure collectors. Five workers are included to operate the vehicles, use the included selection of hand tools, or, apparently, shake hands with each other.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/LttWqUW.png"" style=""width: 474px; height: 393px;"" /><br />
<em>&quot;We are doing such a great job, Chris!&quot;<br />
&quot;I really wish he&nbsp;would stop doing this.&quot;<br />
&quot;JACKHAMMER TIME!&quot;</em></p>

<p>None of these workers are unique to this set, so there&#39;s nothing particularly notworthy about them. Apparently three of the people included are only included in one other set each, so they are a bit more rare than I thought, but in terms of the more general blue collar class of Lego Citizen, they sure seem like a common occurrence (almost as common as mass transit or ferries).&nbsp;Collectors of little red hats can rejoice, I suppose, because this set includes almost a whole mouthful of them. Personally,&nbsp;I appreciate that one of the workers is a lady, because women can demolish things just as well as men. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Perhaps ironically, construction of the Demolition Site&nbsp;is where the set really shines. The build is split into six chunks (in addition to the usual minifigures and assortment of accessories), and they are as follows: the dump truck, the front end loader, the tracks for the wrecking ball crane, the rest of the wrecking ball crane, the foundation for the building, and then the assortment of walls for the building. Each one of those steps has some fun features that I enjoyed, and it barely felt repetitive at all. Even the building, which is pretty&nbsp;ugly on purpose, is fun to build and actually packed with details, like yet another Lego Toilet.</p>

<p>When did the first Lego Toilet appear? Brickset needs to do an article chronicling the history of Lego waste extraction. For a species of people who can&#39;t even remove their pants, they sure seem to make a lot of bears. Apparently Lego Toilets are built to last, too, because it seems to always be the last thing to get demolished.</p>

<p>Anyway, I won&#39;t spoil the real &quot;piece of resistance&quot; in the construction of the building, because my favorite part of building a Lego set is seeing how the features come together. Just know that the dynamite is included in the set for a reason (not to mention the various &quot;explosive&quot; warning signs).</p>

<p>On that note (the warning signs), there are indeed stickers in this set. I know I&#39;m supposed to deride Lego over the inclusion of those hated things, but I don&#39;t mind them that much. They are mostly used as number markings on the vehicles, and I think they could be totally left out without making much difference. Sure, Health and Safety might get on your case about the lack of proper explosive warning signage, but you wouldn&#39;t have to deal with those &quot;awful&quot; stickers.</p>

<p>On the negative side, the crane&#39;s treads do get a little tedious, what with putting together all those little tread pieces. Also, some of the building walls are&nbsp;identical, which means there is a tiny bit of repetition as you put them together. Also also, since the building was designed to easily come apart (well, more easily than Lego inherently is already), it is prone (incredibly prone) to falling apart. For this reason I&#39;m tempted to bump&nbsp;down the playability score a tiny bit, because it really does get annoying. Bump the table - building falls apart. Try to set it back up and nudge it slightly - building falls apart. Try to position the wrecking ball so it looks cool - building falls apart. It&#39;s a little&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;demolishable, if you ask me.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&quot;But demolishing is the point of the whole set, dummy!&quot; I hear you cry. You are correct (but don&#39;t call me Shirley), so I can&#39;t fault it for being so eager to be destroyed. Still, it makes you wonder why it&#39;s taking this crew so long to take apart a building that seems to want to take itself apart.</p>

<p>I really appreciate that components of the building have been built specifically to demolish with all of the means at your disposal, whether smashing a wall with the wrecking ball, just blowing the studs out of it with some dynamite, or straight up tearing it apart with the front-end loader. It&#39;s incredibly fun to play with this set, even if those walls are a bit touchy. There&#39;s plenty of crew to get the job done, although somebody is going to end up getting stuck with a boring shovel when somebody else gets to use the sweet wrecking ball (pro&nbsp;tip:&nbsp;snag the fun equipment while those dudes are distracted shaking hands). The set also comes with a few extra bricks for your scooping, sawing, and dumping pleasure.</p>

<p>It would be sweet if they could have designed the building to be reminiscent of some old set from the 70&#39;s or 80&#39;s, as if that building has been neglected and mistreated by the ravages of time. I&#39;m just curious what this place looked like before it was marked for demolition. It certainly didn&#39;t have a back wall, we know that much at least.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Demolition Site is easily one of my favorite sets that I built in 2015, which I can just barely say because I built it on December 31.&nbsp;Really every inch of this set is packed with playable features, and it makes a really interesting addition to&nbsp;any Lego City. The demolition theme is a good departure from the tired Police and Fire holding pattern that Lego City finds itself in every year. As the flagship set of that theme, Demolition Site really showcases how perfect the subject matter&nbsp;works in the world of Lego. The price isn&#39;t too bad, at just over ten cents (US) per piece, and&nbsp;I think the playable features more than make up for the cost.</p>

<p>Compared to the various additions to Lego City of the last couple years, Demolition Site easily stands as one of the highlights, and in my opinion an absolute must have set, even at the moderate retail price. Lego City might still have a lot of social and infrastructure problems to deal with, but at least there&#39;s finally a solution in place to deal with revitalizing those more dangerous neighborhoods. Unless, of course, they&#39;re just making way for more burglar hideouts.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my review! I hope you enjoy the set as much as I do.&nbsp;Just think, I managed to make it through this whole thing without making a single Miley Cyrus / Wrecking Ball joke - well, almost, anyway.</p>

Plenty of building involved with the 3 vehicles and the building itself. I hoped the building would&#39;ve been&nbsp;bigger but the function to knock the walls down may not of worked as well if that was the case, nevertheless was a fun time-consuming set to build and one I&#39;m definitely happy to have in my collection.</p>
