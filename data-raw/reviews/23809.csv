<p>I managed to get this at 20% off - I wanted to get some work mates for Emmet.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box art is cool, illustrates the playability of the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A few unusual parts, the cage for the digger loader and the toilet bowl from the upside down cone piece being stand out parts for me.</p>

<p>The brick wall parts will be very useful for MOC builders.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigs&nbsp;are for me the highlight of the set, including a Foreman, Female and Male construction worker and the digger driver.</p>

<p>All the minifigs have back and front torso prints. Great additions to Construction Worker&nbsp;Emmet.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fun to build, I liked the toilet particularly. The digger is pretty cool.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

The minifigs are great, good value. I can see it would have a fair amount of play value for younger people.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">I love the idea of the Starter Kits, great way to get a good feel for a group of sets.</span></p>

<p>After building this set, I am tempted to get other sets from this range - well done Lego - you got me.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great value, cool minifigs. Novel toilet design.</p>

<p>Highlight for me was the female construction worker with the sledgehammer.</p>

"UKBRiCKS","2015-01-19T17:00:57.907Z","Great number of minifigs for the price!","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box gives a clear view of all the parts and minifigs in the set. The instructions are easy to follow and my son 7 built this very easily. It also shows the playability features of the set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing unique that I can see, however the brick bricks always look great. The toilet is a clever way of using those parts, would be good for most Lego bathrooms. The digger has an unusual&nbsp;cage piece which can move on a hinge.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>4 minifigs for &pound;8 is great without the other pieces so great value. The drilling man has a cool face and neat hat with ear protection. The woman builder has hair within the hat. All have front and back torso printing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very quick, Josh my son (aged 7)&nbsp;built this in under 15 mins. He also make a stop motion, speed build video&nbsp;<a href=""http://youtu.be/bwqOn-zkiqc"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/bwqOn-zkiqc</a>&nbsp;if you would like to check this. He is very happy with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Starter sets are tempting to buy before purchasing the remaining of the themed sets. I like the construction theme as it lends well to the nature that is LEGO, building. And I appreciate that those city builders love putting these around their city. Great little set, a few more pieces and minifigs than a polybag&nbsp;and good value.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set, will we buy more? Most likely we will, we&nbsp;have been honest with the ratings given the size of the set. The minifigs are the stand out part in this set in our opinion.&nbsp;</p>

"mini_mads1980","2015-02-12T16:08:13.547Z","Site Clearance","<p>One of three small Starter Sets from the 2015 City collection.&nbsp; A great set that will not upset.&nbsp; A must for all collections.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>With this, and the other Starter Sets, you get a decent side box.&nbsp; The picture on the front shows all the components from the set - Mini-Dozzer, Toilet and four Minifigures.&nbsp; The top images show two of the workers, one lady with a sledgehammer and one man with a pneumatic drill.&nbsp; The 1:1 image shows the site foreman.</p>

<p>The back of the box has an image of all four&nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;taking up a third of the space.&nbsp; There are two other images too.&nbsp; One shows the toilet being taken down and the Mini-Dozzer pushing away the rubble.</p>

<p>The instructions have a similar image to the front of the box, but it is slightly stretched and has the four main components of the image in slightly different locations.&nbsp; The instruction booklet has 28 pages with instructions on pages 3 to 24 and a diorama of the 2015 Construction sets on page 25 with the other standard pages.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The best part is probably the 2x2 that makes the bowl of the toilet.&nbsp; All other parts are pretty standard.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four Minigigures - a foreman and three workers.&nbsp; Two of the workers have hard hats with extras attached, one with ear defenders and one with long hair.&nbsp; These sets are about building up your Minifigure numbers for play and they are fantastic.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You won&#39;t get any surprises building this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Perfect.&nbsp; The Mini-Dozzer is great with the parts that you have in the set.&nbsp; The toilet block could be slightly bigger with possibly a complete wall or two and a window but what you do get is not bad at all.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set and the other two smaller Starter Sets out now&nbsp;combined&nbsp;will give you 12 Minifigures and a few great mini vehicles&nbsp;which will give hours of enjoyment for &pound;27 or less if you get a good deal.&nbsp; I can&#39;t think of any Lego set worth less than &pound;30 that has this number of Minifigures - so get all three sets as you will not be disappointed.&nbsp; It is a shame that the Swamp Police Starter Set will not really be compatible with this set and the Fire Starter Set, but I am sure there are plenty with the imagination to make it work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can&#39;t wait till the Space Starter Set is released!</p>

"mr_piggle","2015-10-25T00:25:05.4Z","Demolishing Low Expectations","<p>As an AFOL, I view starter sets as easy ways to add not only to my classroom&#39;s Lego slush pile, but also to flesh out my own Modular city at home. A &nbsp;fan of the starter sets for their minifigures and small additions, this Construction Starter Set did not let me down, even though I kept my expectations quite low.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions &amp; Build</h3>

<p>The box feels substantial, larger than expected for a small set. It&#39;s nice, and it lends the set a respectable presence. I would easily give this set as a gift to a child and not feel terrible about a diminutive size. The box is not smash-packed like other sets I have built recently, which is nice. There&#39;s that old nostalgic brick and cellophane sound. It&#39;s lovely.</p>

<p>The instructions are very easy to follow, and the entire set takes less than ten minutes to construct. There are no surprises in the instructions, and nothing that is unclear. The build is easy and stress-free. I do wish that the masonry bricks were staggered a little bit more on the toilet area, as the walls are very unstable. (However, for my own purposes, it is likely this will end up on the interior of another project and be easily remedied.)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a decent selection of parts. The pieces for the leaking toilet are pretty nifty, the toilet itself is very clever, and I&nbsp;love being able to add masonry bricks to any future project without buying them in bulk from Bricks and Pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You receive four minifigures with this set, which I believe is a great value in itself, since most of the &quot;value&quot; in a set comes from minifigures, and they often sell for 3 to 4 dollars a piece. To add to an existing city, these are great. They are a welcome addition in my own modular city which is presently mostly populated by fire, police, and costumed CMF characters. These figures add some more normalcy.&nbsp;Everyone&#39;s represented: a site foreman, a dozer driver, and two construction workers. The hard&nbsp;hats with the add-ons are great, and the fact that one of the hard hat add ons is long hair for a female makes most of my childhood Lego dreams come true! &nbsp;As a little girl I wish for a female police or fire minifigure with visible hair, as they were my role models. This is a great start, and a welcome addition to my city. I can only hope it pleases present-day little girls as well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There is nothing to truly complain about with this set. The bulldozer manages to be both adorable and true-to-form, and fits in nicely with any construction scene. The spraying toilet is humorous and a great &quot;I wish I&#39;d thought of that&quot; addition as well. The other extras (the safety cones, the tools) all add a lot of play value to the set. The minfigures are spot on. Overall, you can&#39;t go wrong with these starter sets. They are a perfect addition to any scene and really help bring a city to life.&nbsp;</p>

"ZG_Brickfilms","2016-06-10T17:58:28.44Z","Welcome to the world of Demolition","<p>The price of this set is 10 US dollars, which is about 9 euro. So, to get four minifigures and some nice small builds is a great value.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a normal box and has a normal instruction book.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The coolest part in the set in my opinion is the recolor of Gail the Construction Worker&#39;s hat. It has the braid and hard hat together as one, which is great for custom builds. I also like the new bowl piece used in white here.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 4 minifigs. The first is a Construction Forman and there are 3 workers, two male and one female. These are all good figures that will fit well in a city scene.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very good.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The front loader is a good build. However, the front bucket doesn&#39;t line up well with&nbsp;the ground so it can be a little hard to scoop up bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The toilet assembly is what has to be demolished. The back wall can be easily knocked down and the details of broken pipes are great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also get two small traffic cones and a big sledgehammer.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this set. It gives a great extension to any Lego City layout.&nbsp;</p>
