The individual models don't have instructions and I have to guide my 5 yr old some to get them made.  Also most aren't ornaments, but of course every one has to be made into one.  Not a problem since we have other bricks to make attachment points.  This set makes 25 simultaneous models!  That's the best bang for the buck ever for a child.  This is the set that gets my son out of bed every day and I will get these from now on as long as Lego makes them.

For adults I'll say that other than various face pieces these are all fairly standard bricks.  But, it's at least as good as any standard creator kit.   25 Models!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

MINI-MODELS: Well, most are good, but I don't see what a ship or a boat have to do with christmas....... But good nonetheless. I think that getting the present ones are rip-offs, but I think they are cool. There is a blue, and agreen preasent. My favorite model in the calender is...

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The parts:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of for the little price i payed. With about 300 bricks i was very Happy! A really good start for a new start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The models:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First i was suprised to find ships, helicopters and cars in an adventcalendar, but then after a few days the child in me got an revival and i saw the fun it was to discover every day a new toy. With the Option to combine them to totally new toys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>My opinion:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CREATOR has a way to rescale the models in a way that helps a lot to be child again (or a really happy child) and gives the possibility to enjoy what ever you want. The door to your own imagination is opened wide with this set and you can have fun every day, even if christmas is over for a long time. I'm still enjoing that first set of bricks in almost every model i build.</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,4
