Anyways, quick simple build, I think it looks cooler without the decals as I usually do, and&nbsp;it can take a beating.&nbsp; You can set up some cool jumps and stuff and it can take quite a beating with only needing a minor adjustment now and then. For 20 bucks extreme playability in my opinion.&nbsp; We will see how many hundreds of pulls these motors were built for haha.&nbsp; I like the look and performance of the desert racer better than the quad, but i do not regret the purchase.</p>

<p>The model looks really nice and the building experience was satisfying. But for me it just has too less &quot;Technic&quot; and playability in it. Too bad there isn&#39;t a second build. There is actually another build but then you have to buy the Drag Racer, so that doesn&#39;t count.</p>

<p>Normal price is about 20 euro&#39;s. Too much for what you get in my opinion. For children it&#39;s good; the building experience and the playability of a moving Lego Quad with motor.</p>
