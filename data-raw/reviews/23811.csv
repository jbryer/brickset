<p>Very simple but nice box. On the back,&nbsp;the &quot;pull-back&quot; feature is present&nbsp;along with the alternate model that can be made by combining the parts form this set and set #42034</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As someone new to Technic, I am not fully aware of the values of particular pieces. Parts that stood out to me were the airplane-like steering wheel and the tail. Most of the parts in this set are either white, black or dark blue.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Oops! No minifigs here :)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was set in a&nbsp;nice, simple pace. It was very enjoyable and gives you an insight into the inner&nbsp;workings of bigger Technic sets. I was surprised as the whole process took longer than expected, a complete half an hour!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Unlike many other sets from the Technic line,&nbsp;this set has very few &#39;holes&#39; and hollow spaces through it. The front is quite sleek and and handle a bashing of sorts. There is motor detail above the bonnet, probably of some engine intake. The cockpit can open to reveal a nicely shaped seat along with a completely horizontal steering wheel. Finally, there is a tail at the back. Underneath, there is a black wheel which represents a thruster.</p>

<p>The main function of the set is the pull-back motor which works well. It can&nbsp;be pulled quite a ways back. And when released, it zooms past with astonishing speed and distance.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is very inviting to people who have no past experience with Technic. It provides a simple, yet good Technic model that works fine. There are only 6 stickers and this set is suitable for many ages of people who want to explore the world of Technic without emptying their wallet at first! :)</p>

<p>P.S. As for the ratings, a 3/5 is a average in my ratings.</p>

"Sarang","2017-02-13T10:50:15.603Z","Vroom!!!","<p>The pull back racers are a great introduction to LEGO Technic in general. The low piece count and price means that it is a value for&nbsp;money purchase for young kids. Now moving on,</p>

<p><strong>PARTS</strong></p>

<p>Even though this site is relatively small it has a handful of interesting parts to offer. The dark blue curved technic panel pieces which are quite rare and not found in any other sets. Other notable parts include a few panels in white ; the steering wheel, tail fin and the low profile tires.</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>It is breezy and easy to follow for young children since the instructions have a good pace. Nonetheless it hardly takes any time to build the set, just about half an hour.</p>

<p><strong>COMPLETED MODEL</strong></p>

<p>The completed model is surprisingly long and sleek. It does not have any camera unfriendly side and looks good from all angles.</p>

<p>It has some nice touches like the engine intake on the front and the exhaust at the back. There is just enough space to fit a minifig&nbsp;(yay!).</p>

<p>The pullback motor coupled with the low profile tires gives the car it&#39;s namesake&nbsp;<em>Record Breaker speed!&nbsp;</em>and what speed! it whooshes like an arrow!!</p>

<p><strong>LAST </strong><strong>THOUGHTS</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a fun model to build, play with and simply enjoy ! In the end this&nbsp;is a neat set that everyone will love, the target group and the parts collectors alike.&nbsp;</p>
