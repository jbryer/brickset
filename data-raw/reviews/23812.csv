"Gerbil","2015-07-08T18:59:22.53Z","Depends how badly you want a boat really...","<p>I got this because I do eventually plan on expanding the water areas in my city layout. I don&#39;t expect to be playing with the boat in the tub any time soon.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was bigger than I expected, although at least this time it had a big piece to contain, compared to similiar priced ones. Apart from that nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I got this before I had many orange pieces, but they seem to have only become more common over time, so my enthusiasm for them has dropped significantly. The boat hull itself is sleek, and the boat windscreen is uncommon. It also includes a couple of hot-rod style engines which might be nice for some MOCs. The beefy tyres on the truck are nice, and you can choose which way round you fit them for 2 different looks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No printed trousers and uninspiring heads, but the torsos have nice printed jackets with reflective silver designs and zippers.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not complicated, and a lot quicker than I expected. The boat itself takes virtually no time since it is pretty much just the hull with detailing.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Long! Altogether it is quite impressive, although the trailer sans boat looks a bit silly, and is probably too large to want to have around on its own. The boat is sleek and speedy-looking, but I feel there&#39;s a missed opportunity as the whole back part is hollow. This could have been hinged to give engine access, or possibly some sort of smuggling storage.<br />
The truck is somewhat unusual as the cab is entirely enclosed. The bonnet covers a reasonably empty engine space, which could have benefitted again from some detailing inside (and made the bonnet hinged). The back of the truck is a bit of a mess with the trailer uncoupled.<br />
The hook for the trailer would have been better rigid too, as it is if you accidentally jog it, chances are the hook falls down and it is a trickier job than necessary joining the truck and trailer up again.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As a set, I like it. It is big, with a nice colour scheme overall. But each individual item is a mix of wasted chances and odd details. If you bought this for the boat, you won&#39;t be disappointed because it looks great,&nbsp;and it has definite room for a few MODs, as much of the hull space is wasted. The truck is beefy as it should be, but again could benefit from some improvement.<br />
If you like boats or have &#39;water&#39; to fill in your collection, by all means get this. Otherwise, there are likely better value sets around.</p>
