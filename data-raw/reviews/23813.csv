"Hovie","2015-06-20T08:43:04.703Z","The second LEGO snake themed helicopter","<p>I have bought this set for quite a while now. But seeing there&#39;s no review of it, so I decided to sit down and type one.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has a fancy shape, it&#39;s almost like a some sort of&nbsp;rectangle. Anyway, as all the other LEGO boxes, it has the product information, like the set name &amp; number, the age range, the parts&nbsp;count, the minifigures include in it, the play features, and some advertisements. And Ninjago this time seems to be finally come back to its&nbsp;roots, with Kai the red ninja being on the corner of the box, also with some Anacondrai symbol.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;set consists of 311 parts, but only&nbsp;has a small amount of new parts. Being the Anacondrai sword, the Snake headgear, and the new style of&nbsp;1x1 plate with up right clip holder. The rest are just being recolored, into the sand yellow, brick yellow or purple. Personally I like the net piece the most.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set contains 3 minifigures, they are Skylor, Chen, and Eyezor. Skylor and Eyezor are exclusive to this set (the reason why I picked this up back in the store). Chen also appears in set 70749 Enter the Serpents,&nbsp;this version of him doesn&#39;t come with&nbsp;the Staff of Elements nor his flashy cape, but wield&nbsp;a Wolverine claw. Seriously, he&nbsp;has the weakest value as a minifigure in this set. Meanwhile, Skylor -Chen&#39;s daughter is very cool, she is the first ever female ninja in the whole line, but appears in one wave of sets only, such a shame. Her color is the flame yellow, some people call it &quot;Keetorange&quot;, and she is equipped with a silver crossbow and a quiver.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build start off with the minifigures, and then Skylor&#39;s rocket&nbsp;board, and then the Condrai copter itself. I feel the build is quite satisfying, a&nbsp;lot of great techniques has been use for the copter. That&#39;s all I could say about the build, sorry for it&#39;s too short.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Skylor&#39;s rocket board is quite a neat and cool model, it could even work great itself&nbsp;as a polybag set. The Condrai&nbsp;copter is even more amazing, I just really like the shape and the color scheme that they have come with.&nbsp;Purple, Black, and Brick Yellow all three together, with the help of a few minor colors, the model looks very eye-catching. I only feel&nbsp;weird that the copter flies using three small turbine: two on each wings and one on the tail. Both the wings utilizes&nbsp;ratcheted joints so they can freely rotate 360 degrees, and each of them has a flick fire missile to shoot. All of the turbines can spin and so are the propellers, because they are Technic pins. The copter also has the net shooting function, which I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a great idea, well there is just a lot of kind of projectiles but they choose the net, oh my brick!&nbsp;*FACEPALM*</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All told, this set is definitely not my favorite out of this wave, but it has 2 exclusive minifigures, the model has a lot of action features, and the&nbsp;price per part ratio&nbsp;is&nbsp;pretty good. So I would recommended this set to you if you want to buy it, especially if you are a Ninjago fan. Thanks a lot for reading my review.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is medium-sized, and with awesome pictures of the set. It shows Skylor on her hoverboard&nbsp;fighting the Anacondrai, and Chen and Eyezor&nbsp;taking her on. The instructions are simple to read, just as all of the others. Details are still the same. Wish they could add some kind of cool feature. Just throwing that out there.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts are very familiar to me. They probably are to you as well, if you are a Ninjago fan. The hair piece for Eyezor is new to me, along with the net. I don&#39;t have that many sets with that feature.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>These minifigures are really rare. This is the only set that houses Skylor, and Chen can only be found in this set and set 70749 Enter the Serpent, but in a different form. Eyezor is also only found in this set. Anyway, Skylor comes in a standard Ninja outfit, just a yellow-gold color. She also has a crossbow, and a quiver of arrows on her back. Chen comes in his royal head piece, standard Anacondrai robes, and with a claw-like blade. The only difference between him and the one in set 70749 is that the one in 70749 has a cape. Eyezor comes in a leather jacket&nbsp;tunic, ragged pants/legs, a missing eye on the head painting, and a mohawk. He definitely stands out from the others. He also has the common Anacondrai blade, as seen held by most warriors, such as Chop&#39;rai&nbsp;in set 70748, Titanium Dragon.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set was simple. The only issue I had was when I had to put the net into position. It doesn&#39;t fit too well, but when it goes in, it stays until fired.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The main set is awesome. Skylor&#39;s&nbsp;board doesn&#39;t do anything, which is unfortunate. It would be nice to know it could do something other than be a ride for her. Anyway, the helicopter is awesome. The wings are posable, and so are the helicopter rotaters. Flick missiles are hidden in the middle of the wings as well. The cockpit is separated into two parts: one for Chen and one for Eyezor. According to the picture on the box, where Eyezor sits there is the steering mechanism, and Chen has a button on his side. What it does, I don&#39;t know. On the back of the vehicle, there is a button to push, which will eject the net. Lots of cool hidden features on this helicopter.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is awesome. The only complaint I have is that Skylor&#39;s&nbsp;board does nothing. In the future, if she is included in the future, they need to have her board do something. Besides that, this is awesome. LEGO does it again!</p>

The character of Skylor was a big deal, a female ninja with a new colour, was she friend or foe? Definitely really impressive.

His head is single sided with a smiling evilly smirk expression and a very detailed and unique looking head piece sculpt. The skull of a Serpentine with some added snake elements. His legs feature printing for his robes and he includes a Wolverine claw weapon accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>

He also has a serpentine tooth necklace or charm and a great belt clasp. His legs feature printing including on the toes for spike toed shoes and a single sided head tattoo markings and some odd pattern around one eyes showcasing an injury perhaps.</span></span></span></span></p>

Sadly she was not given an extra hair piece for when you want her not to wear the mask, and seeing as how she hasn&rsquo;t appeared in any sets recently that is most unfortunate.</span></span></span></span></p>

Here you start out with the lower chassis of the vehicle, it&rsquo;s all very quick to build and the only irksome part for younger builders may be getting the net launcher into position properly when loading it.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s a lot to do here with thinner build areas, as the central section of the Copter is rather thin, only two studs wide and featuring a lot of plates, cheese slopes and bones to place around. A long sticker is placed on a lengthy slope piece, that part may need help when it comes time to the build step there.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 3: Master Chen and Eyezor join the construction team with this bag and you&rsquo;ll finish the Copter by building both wing sections. This build is asymmetrical, it repeats itself only reversed when you start building naturally. Nothing really difficult here, just repetitive, also stickers for detailing on two of the sloped pieces here as well.</span></span></span></span></p>

Not bad, but not the best mini-vehicle build Ninjago has ever given us.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Condrai Copter: Taking up the bulk of the parts count in this set this VTOL style vehicle is very well designed. I found it to be one of the highlights of the wave honestly, which is why I chose it out of most of the other vehicles to get.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">It is a sleek and intricate looking design with three tiny rotors to provide lift, one located in the tail. It seats two characters in the cockpit and evokes a nice serpentine design in the front end with teeth and bones and rugged rocky pieces that make it look as though it were carved from the remains of a fallen snake. Or a few rocks and things.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">For play features you have two side mounted flick fire missiles, the armatures house the launchers and the engines and can be moved in any general direction that the joints can accommodate. The central cockpit hides a secret net launcher to use when attempting to capture Skylor. Overall a very solid vehicle and a nice design compared to some of the other offerings from LEGO Ninjago.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ninjago never fails to impress and while earlier years I wasn&rsquo;t as interested honestly in the vehicle designs it would seem that the design team has really started stepping up their game. The Condrai Copter is an excellent villain vehicle and includes three great Minifigures for a great price. If it is still available in your area and you don&rsquo;t already own it then by all means pick this up, I strongly recommend it as one of the better offerings from 2015. The only thing that could have made this better would be if Master Chen had included his Staff of Elements accessory, though I can understand why LEGO would prefer you spend the money on the larger set to have that particular accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>
