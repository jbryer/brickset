I wasn&#39;t expecting much, but seeing as I&#39;m really into Ninjago I figured I would probably end up getting it eventually. With 219 pieces and 2 minifigs this set will set you back about $20, so I certainly thought this would be a really simple, boring set. I was wrong, to say the least.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very bright and colorful, typical of a Ninjago set. The parts come separated in two numbered bags, with the two back wheels and instructions loose in the box. The instructions are all contained in one small booklet and are all pretty straightforward.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part selection in this set isn&#39;t anything special. Besides the new minifigure elements, the main thing I noticed were the dark tan scimitars, new in this color,&nbsp;that make up the front blades of the crusher. You get 6 of them in this set which is pretty sweet. Most, if not all, of the rest of the parts have been seen before. They are mostly dark tan, white, and purple.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs in this set are both fantastic. That being said, for most people they won&#39;t be the draw to the set, as neither is unique.</p>

<p>Kai comes in one of his new 2015 variants, complete with leg, torso, and back printing, all of which are superb. The design is slightly similar to the original outfit worn by Kai in 2011. The headpiece is the same as ever, but the hood is printed with a&nbsp;Japanese(?) character on the front. Finally, a new element is used on the back to hold his two katanas. Cast in brown, it is very similar to the ZX armor, just without the shoulder pads. I like this part&nbsp;a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Krait also comes in this set, and also has great leg/torso/back printing. His bare chest has purple snake tattoos which are continued onto his head. His snake skull helmet really completes the figure, and I think it&#39;s a fun little piece that nobody can complain about. Krait wields&nbsp;a new Anacondrai&nbsp;sword that is tan with purple edges. Again a lovely new part that is sure to please everyone.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Construction of this set is nothing too difficult or exciting. At&nbsp;a $20 price point, this is to be expected. Only a little bit of SNOT is used, and very little technic building is necessary. There are 3 stickers that are pretty easy to apply. I think the model would suffer,&nbsp;aesthetically&nbsp;speaking, without adding them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>You may be wondering why, when I&#39;ve mentioned a lack of cool parts, non-exclusive minifigures, and a simple build, I rated this set so highly. It&#39;s unusual for a Ninjago build to be better than the figures, but the Anacondrai Crusher is proof that this is possible. The model looks fabulous, with its fully posable tail, large back wheels, and ornate front. The tan pieces combined with the purple highlights and white bones together make up a beautiful color scheme. Two flick fire missiles are included. something I thought strange considering TLG&#39;s recent push of spring-loaded weapons, but the mechanism for firing them works so well that I&#39;m not even disappointed.</p>

<p>The main function of the crusher is the rotating front blades. This was attempted with very little success not once but twice last year, in 70722: OverBorg Attack and 70726: Destructoid. In both of these models the spinning blades turned out to be an utter failure, so I was expecting a very similar result here. But no! The blades work really well on both carpet and hard surfaces! Somebody at LEGO has finally figured out how to correctly construct such a function, which is great news.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all, I fear this set won&#39;t receive the attention it deserves. Casual Ninjago fans will feel no need to purchase it when the minifigs are accessible&nbsp;elsewhere. Typical FOL&#39;s will dismiss it as &#39;more of that Ninjago&nbsp;junk.&#39; The only people who will actually purchase this will be Ninjago Enthusiasts, which is a shame as I think this is a set everybody can love. It&#39;s got great minifigs and an even better build, all at a really low price point. I would heartily recommend this set to anyone looking to have a fun time!</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-03-31T15:04:42.113Z","Easily Overlooked... but Totally Boss!","<p>You would be hard-pressed to notice this set on the shelves of your local toy outlet. The box is perched between the brighter Jungle Raider and larger and more exciting Condrai Copter Attack. It is in fact surrounded by smaller, brighter, larger, and more eye-catching sets in the Ninjago section. So why, then, did I choose this over either of the above sets? And is this little guy worth looking out for and spending $15-$20 on?</p>

<p>BOX/INSTRUCTIONS<br />
The box is the standard $20 size, but very thin. About half the size of the Mining Truck box. When you slit the tape on one side, the box is revealed to be PACKED full of stuff--a promising start. Inside are two large plastic wheels, a small instruction book, one TINY sticker sheet, and two half-empty bags of parts. A set this small doesn&#39;t need numbered bags.</p>

<p>PARTS<br />
This set has loads of cool pieces. (Notice I said cool, not useful.) Among the highlights are a snake-skull helmet, printed 4x4 dark tan dishes, six dark tan scimitars, purple cheese slopes and baby bows, a new sword-holder element, Power Miners wheels in dark bley, a new tan-and-purple sword aesthetically similar to the helmet, and more than a dozen small white teeth. THe set also features dark tan slopes and brick-bricks, old floppy-armed skeleton torsos, and a set of old, sideways Classic Space hinges.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES<br />
In typical $20 action themed-set fashion, we get two figures: a hero and a villain. Kai is the ninja of fire, featuring a brand-new sword holder and new a new 2012-ish outfit. Krait is a very interesting dude... first, head to toe, he&#39;s composed of new parts. Some gorgeous paint jobs are at work, and he gets all-new helmet and sword pieces that fit the snake vibe like a glove.</p>

<p>BUILD<br />
The build is extremely fast for a 200-odd piece set. Miniscule amounts of SNOT and a fair bit of Technic, but nothing special.</p>

<p>COMPLETED SET<br />
Whoa... look at the detail on this thing! Interesting colors, textures, and spikes are all over this thing. But not only does it look boss, it has some wicked features up its sleeve. First, the flick-fires. Carefully hidden inside the mouth and fired with a Technic trigger, they don&#39;t hurt the appearance at all and fire very well.&nbsp;And pushing this beast forward, the front wheels push a diabolical set of blades that shred attacking minifigures to bits. (Not really. But it is lots of fun.)</p>

<p>I should probably note that Kai has a little catapult thing that works as well as it ever does. Oddly enough, the catapult piece hits up against a part on either side of it. This seems to make it fire marginally better than it does free to flop around, so it actually does throw its payload, but it&#39;s still completely ineffectual.</p>

<p>OVERALL OPINION<br />
If you can find this set, I highly reccomend it. Anacondrai Crusher is fun, detailed, and stuffed with cool parts and figures.</p>

<p>Side note: My Walmart stocks this set for 20% off of the MSRP $20. If you can score it for $16, PLEASE do so. You will not regret it.</p>
