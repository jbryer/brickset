"doc_sponge","2015-12-27T09:04:34.313Z","Good introduction","<p>This is my first Elves set, and seems a good introduction.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions quite chunky for a set this size, with a nice background image. I like the Elves&#39; box style. I feel Lego is trying to allow space for the Elves series to not just be for girls (by toning down the pink, and having a male character) - which is good to see. I fear it doesn&#39;t work, but at least they try.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some nifty little pieces in the set, including a few nice transparent purple 1x1 and 1x2 bricks, which are cool window pieces but not very common. No stickers, just printed pieces! The ruler seems unique to this set, and is a good piece, though the printing doesn&#39;t quite exactly measure in lego units (it looks two to one stud, but it&#39;s slightly too long). And scissors! And lots of purple, which is the best Lego colour of course.<br />
<br />
One thing of note - the number of spares for this set is impressive!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Aira&#39;s is well detailed and has awesome hair. Her skirt is strangely fascinating - definitely a step up from the average Friends fashion choices. The little bird is a nice addition to my Lego animal collection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quick, fun, straightforward. I&#39;m not so sure about the food for the bird though - it falls out too easily.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice set with lots of little things with good playability (I&#39;m guessing).&nbsp; Aira seems a clever elf and her wind up flying device is not fidly at all, like I would have expected. The desk is my favourite part - the set of drawers seemed quite clever.<br />
<br />
It does have a feeling of being a parallel universe version of a Friends set - like Emma&#39;s fashion studio, or Olivia&#39;s workshop, but that&#39;s all good.</p>

<p>Overall opinion<br />
<br />
As my first introduction to the Elves theme I found this set satisfying and worth investigating.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-02T21:17:19.23Z","Aira has an interesting little workshop","<p><strong>Set #41071 Aira&rsquo;s Creative Workshop: </strong>LEGO took the Friends popularity and profitability and used their marketing and research development teams to excellent degree as they introduced the second Theme of Mini-Doll based sets that are original IP characters. These are LEGO Elves and they really stand out as some impressively designed sets with loads of even more new colour options for the parts. For this review we&rsquo;ll go over everything as much as we can and explain the best aspects of this new Theme.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts in this set include a nice mixture of light tan bricks with some purple arches and a few printed elements that are a great addition to any MOC enthusiasts pile. You&rsquo;ll find some printed tiles, one a ruler and another a unique fantasy scroll element, as well as a printed circular tile with what I presume to be Aira&rsquo;s elemental sign. Great and conveniently priced parts pack.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Aira: Aira Windwhistler introduces some new Mini-Doll parts. Each Elf Mini-Doll, at least the female characters, includes a unique lower torso piece with a differently cut skirt whose hem features two distinct colorings, revealing underskirts being worn by the Elves. Aira has a nice flowing white skirt with a hint of purple matching her hair underneath. (Or at least almost matching her hair, the lower skirt is a slightly darker purple colour.)</p>

<p>The upper torso also a nice highly detailed new print style with ties to each Elf&rsquo;s elemental ties. Aira has some nice wing pattern with a heart on her stomach in a nice mesh design. I kind of wish LEGO could print on the back of the torsos as well, however since the TM info is sculpted into the back of the mini-doll and stands out, having a print over it would be rather unimpressive.</p>

<p>Each hair piece is brand new and nicely sculpted as well, including some elf ears sticking out from the hair, Aira&rsquo;s is purple, a nice light purple, with white on the tips and a braided section which is really impressive. You can also attach one of the Friends hair accessories to the back, a bow or something.</p>

<p>Aira also has a lot of accessories, we&rsquo;ll cover most of those in the model itself, however of interest is a printed map piece which shows the location of her key and her mystical power represented by a small purple stud of SNOT design. Her face also has more printing than your standard Mini-Doll with what amounts to tattoo like designs on her forehead and right cheek. Overall some excellent new design choices and a great look for the Mini-Dolls of this Theme.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model &amp; build</strong></p>

<p>The build of this set is similar to most small Friends sets in this price range. Numerous mini model builds which serve as set pieces for the Mini-Doll to play with and interact, Aira is an inventive character, similar to Olivia, she uses her understanding of the air element to craft wondrous things and enjoys what she does.</p>

<p>This set involves a very nice series of builds. There&rsquo;s a small work desk with functioning drawer that holds a spare ink well, a pair of scissors, a new printed ruler piece which matches the Theme quite well and is different from the butterfly ruler print favored in Friends sets, a quill for writing and a printed tile piece for Aira to write on, with a scroll on it. You also have two more ink wells. These ink wells are very nicely designed, using 1x1 plates in different colours with clear plates on top of them and a small smooth gold stud for the lid. It is a very impressive design, simple and elegant.</p>

<p>The model&rsquo;s larger build is a small bird house with what I&rsquo;m assuming is Aira&rsquo;s friend or pet bird. It&rsquo;s a very elaborate construction with a spot for a letter to sit, though I&rsquo;m not sure why that&rsquo;s there, and a sliding cookie dispenser play feature for the bird to get a special treat. It&rsquo;s a very nice model with some nice use of the dark purple and light tan pieces. The bird is also a nice looking piece, it&rsquo;s a white version of the Friends Animal with some nice printed detailing enhancing the magical nature of the beasts of this new Elvish realm. In this case the detailing shows a feathery necklace of some sort.</p>

<p>The final build is two separate pieces, a small footstool kind of item and a highly detailed looking winged backpack/flying device for Aira to use and tinker with. This is a great looking model with some beautiful golden coloured wings first introduced in the Legends of Chima line for the flying tribes.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m extremely impressed with how this entire set came together, the builds are simple, fast and fun, use a large number of great parts and include some printed elements instead of stickers. The Elves Theme is definitely one I look forward to seeing more of.</p>

<p>Aira Windwhistler looks very nice and is a great new Mini-Doll style with some impressive sculpting work. I strongly recommend this set as a decent parts pack, considering the number of printed pieces here and some great accessories such as the scissors you can&rsquo;t go wrong with it at this price point.</p>
