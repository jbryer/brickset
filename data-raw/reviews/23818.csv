"Frothycoffeeman","2015-01-27T22:47:07.183Z","Hmmmmmm, pretty but a bit naf","<p>This purchase was&nbsp;a bit of retail therapy, I might need more therapy now. A lot of not as clever as it thinks it is going on here. So not considered value for money.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box worked! The model looks stunning and who doesn&#39;t like connecting 96 catapillar&nbsp;tracks together?!</p>

<p>Mid priced so no cardboard, lots of stickers (woo yay! Not).</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>see right panel, a few new bits, from the 3xcross pin thingy in black to the all new clutch assembly with idiot proof gears (there is no option to fit them on to the clutch&nbsp;the wrong way!).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Considering that&nbsp;there are 4 tracked er... Propulsion units to build, it was surprisingly un-tedious, vaguely effective suspension, you are kind of left with a sense of impending doom as you get 4/5ths of the way in and the chassis is complete and dressed, leaving you with just the crane to add. Oh dear oh dear oh dear. This crane is&nbsp;not an effective addition. A bit budget/ Friday afternoon deadline vs get to the pub to my thinking. Still we can&#39;t all be awesome all the time.</p>

<p>Nice gearbox not a huge amount going on though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>6/10 must try harder, we have opening doors, tipping cargo bed, very poor crane with the worst swivel &quot;function&quot; everrrrrrrrr! &nbsp;Awful steering, weak suspension but it is independent (yay!). More frustration than playability and this comes from someone who still plays with the pneumatics on the Unimog!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A pretty enough edition to your collection but&nbsp;not a must have, unless you&#39;re&nbsp;getting a deal&nbsp;or have a track fetish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing unusual here. Nice box design, B model on the back along with PF advert. Looks like that Lego i going to use their new &#39;one big book&#39; policy only on the biggest sets from wave, since this one comes with two thin manuals and the 42039 comes with one thick (so does mine 42025) B model instructions only available on-line, as usual with bigger sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Quite a few new parts. 6x 1L beam, 11x 2L axle -1L pin, new gearbox system with double-sided clutch gears and more. Also you get a lot of orange parts which match those form Unimog. And 96 big track links (pain to build them though).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Starting with the gearbox, which seems a bit messy at first, but works in the end. Tha you add something from the chassis. Next are three link suspended axles, tipping bed and paneling with cabin. After that 4 tracks mechanism (build 2 at the time). Crane is the last thing you build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks good, fairly large but not bulky. Tracks and steering are useless on smooth surface but on carpet it works just fine. Crane is a big disappointment and feels unfinished, I actually made a modification to it by connecting the small LA 1 stud closer to the winch so I can put cargo all tha way to the front of the bed, while crane can still by folded horizontally. Suspension is a bit softer but works fine. Steering is a bit stiff, maybe replacing the 3L friction pins with non friction would help?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good and interesting build, attractive Orange/black color scheme. Something completely new to Technic line, but it could use a bit of polishing, even if it would cause higher price and piece count.</p>
