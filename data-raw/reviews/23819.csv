Is it worth tracking down if you haven&rsquo;t already picked it up? Hopefully this review will help make up your mind.</span></span></span></span></p>

It might not seem like much, but those images are really impressive and not generally found on LEGO boxes too often.</span></span></span></span></p>

The back still has the shot of all the sets available this year, which is sometimes not included in sets of this size. There&rsquo;s also a sticker sheet for details here, which can get damaged because there is no real protection&hellip; it&rsquo;s rare to find mangled or crushed sticker sheets, but it is still a possibility.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her dress has a nice printed star pattern on the bottom and includes a treble clef, which I assume is meant to evoke her singing talents. The top torso has nice printing for the pink dress and includes a clean cut neck line with white lace and printed detailing on the stomach to match her dress&rsquo;s design.</span></span></span></span></p>

Applying the stickers might need help, other than that it should be easy to follow along with the steps and build everything.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bed: Aurora&rsquo;s bed is comfortable and small for a model, the large sloped purple pieces are used to make a hanging curtain effect for what is commonly referred to as a canopy bed. There&rsquo;s also a piece of plant growing out of the top, perhaps to indicate the thorns that Maleficent created to prevent Prince Phillip from reaching her. A heart shaped jewel is placed on the top, the entire bed features a play element, you can flip it up on a hinge to reveal a hiding place where a crystal wand is kept hidden. Apparently Aurora can use magic in the LEGO universe.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her seat can be stored underneath the counter top, making everything fit together and store when not in use.</span></span></span></span></p>

The design is nice, with a golden wagon wheel being used for the spindle and a golden unikitty horn being used for the needle on top of the white spool, all-in-all a decent model to add some play to the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

The white rabbit is more fitting for Alice, an owl might have made for a nice nod to the film, however it works to add more to do with such a small set for the younger fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As far as cheaper sets go this one isn&rsquo;t too bad. Younger builders will find more to do with it and use their imagination for some great play elements. Older fans will more than likely only want it for the unique Aurora mini-doll. It&rsquo;s fine for what it is, but it isn&rsquo;t the best out of this line. There&rsquo;s a large inconsistency as to what you would expect, however Sleeping Beauty is known for her cursed sleep so giving her a bedroom makes sense.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The models work and are cohesive together with good aesthetics, it&rsquo;s just a shame that you couldn&rsquo;t get a Prince Phillip or even on of the Three Good Fairies as an extra character to play with. Giving Aurora a rabbit instead of an owl was a bit of a missed opportunity as well. And I say that mostly based on the film, where it was the owl who served as the head when she was dancing with her dream prince in the forest.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Do I recommend this set? Mostly for fans of the Theme who want to have every set released, otherwise it is safe to skip it for AFOLs looking for a little bit better display options. Nab Aurora off Bricklink and then add her to her room in the new Disney Castle set coming out in September of this year.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Hashem1983","2018-07-07T15:46:27.89Z","I Bought it for its Parts","<p>I saw this set online with a decent price few years ago, I got to say that I only bought it for its parts only.</p>

<p>It might not come as a complete bedroom and moreover as parts of it, but it can be used for personal builds. However, I did like the build of the bed with a secret storage under the mattress, for a small set its a very nice feature. You also get a small hair dresser and of course you get spinning wheel with a spindle since its &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and you get nice accessories with it.</p>

<p>There is one mini-doll in this set, which is Arura, and you either put on her head the Tiara or the bow, and I like to add that the material of the hair piece is rubbery and it could be used on the normal mini-figure heads and I find it very nice on them that I do hope they reproduce this hair piece for the figures.</p>

<p>All in all it&#39;s nice set for little girls with decent budget or for the use of the parts.</p>
