It's great features are many.....the way you can store the astronaut's airtanks on the back of the chairs, the two cool buggies - including one with what will always look to me like a rotating blaster cannon - with a car port, as well as two great radar dishes, lots of control consoles and the giant tele-screen. I also love the fake craters and the strong sense of color and design. It looks good from any angle.

It was always the nerve center of my space colony on the hostile planet Outworld. Building it last night brought back many strong feelings of deja-vu as I brought well-worn old brain pathways back into service. I haven't thought of terms like &quot;flat-sixer&quot; or &quot;four-brick&quot; in a long time.....",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

My brother and I would use the minfigs as Star Wars characters while we played and I remember wishing they would come out with Star Wars Legos!  Well, we only had to wait about 20 yrs.  Anyway, I'm partial to the sets of the late '70s because of their simplicity and playability.  These sets were very sturdy, unlike some of the current sets I own.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The one difference is set 926 had the baseplate with the L-shaped craters built into it, this set you had to build the craters yourself out of individual bricks (look closely near the stairs in the picture). Otherwise they're exactly the same. Just thought I'd mention it. I have the later version, great set except it's hard to get people in and out of the chairs without breaking them.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
