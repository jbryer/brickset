<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a rectangle with some pretty papers. :-)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some rare pieces are the key, the baker&#39;s hair, and the dough. I&nbsp;like the croissant and I&nbsp;think that the key is pretty cute, and I really&nbsp;like the cupcake top. I also like&nbsp;the Chocolate chip&nbsp;cookie.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are Azari and Johnny baker.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s very fun and&nbsp;took about 45 minutes to complete. And, (If it&#39;s possible to have more,)&nbsp;is pretty easy to work with.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is really&nbsp;cool and I&nbsp;like to play with it a lot. It looks like a real bakery;&nbsp;it is&nbsp;kind of leafy for a bakery though.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s very fun to play with. You&nbsp;should match it with the Treetop Hideaway (41075).</p>

<p>The features are very good, my six year old cousin loved this set because of the way the key was hidden so well. The bread oven really did add a lot more life to the bakery.</p>

<p>Overall, all good set maybe I would have preferred it if it includes one more animal companion or mini doll.</p>
