Just about every one of you has to have bought at least one of these sets because, well, they&#39;re really original, varied and fun, from classic space fans to city traditionalists, to kids who crave transformation and destruction, there&#39;s a little piece for everyone. Of course with everything, <em>someone </em>has to have (rather idiotically) missed it, and the last 3 sets are little more than cheap ways to get the essentials for those people, to the point where most countries retired it already. It may seem unimpressive, but really, it&#39;s nice to close out a great line for a great movie that way.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Minifigures</h3>

<p>Included in this set are Wyldstyle (or Lucy, if you please), Good Cop/Bad Cop, and two Robo Swat Members. Aside from some [minor] differences in the facial printing, all of these figures have appeared in sets prior, and harping on them is unecessary. Not to say they&#39;re bad figures, and having such a cheap set to get them in is great, but they still are what they are-just extra bonuses.</p>

<h3>As a Display Model</h3>

<p>Speaking of just &quot;extra bonuses,&quot; the main component of the set is little more than 70802 &quot;Bad Cop&#39;s Pursuit&quot; prior to it transforming in the movie. If anything they could&#39;ve just released that set as a 2-in-1 like many of the other sets and no one would know the difference. Much of the same features are retained here, including the really serious black-and-white, the roof element attached backwards, the front bar, the stabilizer, the single seat... if you have that set, something like this isn&#39;t necessary. But nonetheless, it is a very good-looking car, both more realistically sized than most other cars, yet heavy-duty and mean.</p>

<h3>As a Playset</h3>

<p>While it doesn&#39;t do much more than most high-speed chase sets, it doesn&#39;t do less either. It offers 2, very graspable vehicles to go at ultrasonic speed through the highway only to stop at the portal at the city border, and can easily be taken down by Wyldstyle with her expert skills in, uh, destroying things I guess? It&#39;s just that, though. No vehicle for the good guy&#39;s side, nothing to shoot with or pretend to, as it is, it&#39;s a car. I think my favorite play feature, though, is the tiny little chair to get super-angry at.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>As a Building Experience</h3>

<p>Despite a fairly average and straight-forward end result, the build for this is rather entertaining. There&#39;s actually fewer traditional &quot;car parts&quot; than other sets, and there&#39;s quite a bit of plate-on-plate techniques, combined with studs on the side to give it some subtle thickness, as wells as nicely done curved lights and grilles. I especially enjoyed putting together the front, which I&#39;ll let you look at.</p>

<h3>As a Parts Pack</h3>

<p>Black Parts, White Parts, Grey Parts... just about everything included in this set has been included in many, many, many sets in the past, and if you&#39;re into creations this set is of little worth.</p>

<h3>The Value Overall</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not a particularly good set, nor is it a bad one, all it is is a larger double-decker couch: the sets released in past waves all rolled-up into a small and inexpensive last hurrah. And I rather like that about it, it really lets even the most reluctant of fans to still have a taste of the line, and calmly closes it up without so many tears. But that&#39;s just it, it&#39;s fairly niche for that audience, and if you have just about any other Lego Movie set (Bad Cop&#39;s Pursuit especially), you won&#39;t be needing this.&nbsp;</p>

"Turtlemoht","2015-10-15T09:31:19.86Z","A great set to fill-out our LEGO Movie scenes","<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>This set comes in a nice rectangular box that features action scenes front and back, all done in the dark blue LEGO Movie motif. Very nice. Well up to LEGO&#39;s standards.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are not spectacular but they&#39;re useful and come in ever-useful black and white. Both builds are solid and feel strong (with ~80% of the pieces building Bad Cop&#39;s chunky car).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any pieces are unique, but for me it&#39;s more about what you build with them...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures here are a great mix and can all contribute to the scene depicted. Like the pieces discussed above, the figures here aren&#39;t particularly remarkable but they&#39;re a cohesive set and may help fill-out your LEGO Movie cast.</p>

<p>Bad Cop:&nbsp;This version has a unique face and both the good and bad faces are present (unlike the collectible minifigure version). Pre-scribble&nbsp;face&nbsp;Bad Cop is only available in two small&nbsp;sets and the faces aren&#39;t distinct enough to declare one is better than the other. On balance, I prefer this set to <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70802-1/Bad-Cop-s-Pursuit"">70802</a> so this is where I put my money. Importantly, this set comes with Bad Cop&#39;s chair; a critical accessory.</p>

<p>Wyldstyle: Like Bad Cop, this minifigure has a unique face, but as one of the more common characters from the line, she&#39;s not a big draw this time around. A quick search suggests that a &#39;hood down&#39; black costume Wyldstyle is available in five sets, then there&#39;s the &#39;hood up&#39; version, space version and collectible minifigure western version... Still, the character&#39;s great and this is a great representation of her.</p>

<p>Robo SWAT goons: You get two of these, and if you have several LEGO movie sets, you should have a nice bunch of them in <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/name-Robo-SWAT"">various configurations</a>. I think this is a good thing, and in this set you get both face variants and body armour and helmet/hat options.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is a mixed bag. Bad Cop&#39;s car looks great but the building techniques aren&#39;t particularly unusual. However, the Robo SWAT bike is quite the opposite; busy, unexpected and interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set gives you everything you need to re-enact a great scene from early in teh LEGO Movie and the result is better than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>Bad Cop&#39;s car is an absolute beast. It&#39;s heavy, solid and he can barely see over the dashboard. The Robo SWAT bike is a very different build and can be re-configured for some interesting outcomes. You get a range of weapons, Bad Cop&#39;s chair and the movie&#39;s heroine, all in one box.</p>

<p>One part I can&#39;t comment on is how this version of Bad Cop&#39;s car compares with the flying version from <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70802-1/Bad-Cop-s-Pursuit"">70802</a>. In the movie one is built out of the other. From what I can tell&nbsp;this is a bit of movie magic as the pieces look quite different from the bonnet down.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set the gives you a whole scene, a nice number of evil characters to fill out your LEGO Movie collection and there are also a few little extras that feel like a bonus.</p>

<p>Value is where this set really shines. I bought the set for less than AU$25 and for what&#39;s included this is fantastic value. Highly recommended.</p>
