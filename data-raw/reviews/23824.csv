<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A few booklets are included and take you through the vehicles and hideout itself. They are very clear and the box illustrates some of the play options and features on the back.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>nearly 500 parts come with this set and some I had never seen before. In particular the large helicopter blades were new for me and the cockpit glass was also new for me. The bits of vegetation hanging from the environmental element were also a nice touch. I appreciate the inclusion of an element separator in this set. Also loved the turkey leg that is included my kids laugh every time they see it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figures all have nice printing on them. The female crook specially looks really mean and her short hair makes her look like a bit of a spitfire. The other crooks look very angry to be in the swamp. The police officer has nice shades and the pilot has a full police flight suit print and looks amazing with this polarized glasses printed right on his face. The alligator is also amazing with a wide swiping tail and a huge gape for its mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was more complex than the builds I remember from my childhood. Some technic pins are used to put both piers of the hide out together and a lot fo tiles were included to give texture to the walls of the hide out. The vehicles in particular were a lot of fun. That huge police SUV is real treat! It has bigger tires than the normal for current Lego trucks and rolls very well on flat surfaces and even cruises over some serious obstacles with ease. It is very durable too with it withstanding some nasty bumps against the wall with minimal parts coming loose. Some stickers were used in particular on the top roof panels but if you are careful and patient you can get them on cleanly. The police vehicles also needed stickers but they are not many and add a great look to the completed set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Everything looks so nice. The crooks&#39; equipment looks run down and beat up but has a lot of texture and looks very plausible. The police hardware looks amazing and having a big objective in the form of the hide out makes for a ton of imaginative play for children and a joy to see come together as an adult. The star of the show I feel is the police SUV. That is one cool piece of police kit!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Fantastic! It fits well with traditional cops and robbers play and has the added fun of imagining the chase in the water. That SUV looks sleek particularly with the small rigid hull craft removed. Very very cool.&nbsp;</p>
