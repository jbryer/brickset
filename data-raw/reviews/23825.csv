"Lochdent","2017-03-19T01:55:45.34Z","Great Starter ","<p>I purchased this set as a way to introduce my partner to building with Lego. There is a great selection of parts and colours for younger builders but also for anyone either starting out or just looking for some bricks to play around with. The bonus is that it comes in a sturdy cardboard box with a plastic lid to keep it all in.</p>

<p>The official&nbsp;models the set includes are fun, simple and diverse but not all models are included in the instructions. This is to encourage you to go online and use their online instructions and I think this is a great idea as the instruction book can then be ever expanding.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set to pretty much anyone whether they are a hardcore Lego fan or not, it really takes building back to basics and reminds me of the silly fun I had with it as a kid.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2017-05-07T05:11:33.43Z","Definitely an introductory set. ","<p>The theme now known as Classic has released a ton of sets over the last couple of years and many include very useful pieces. How does this set stack up?</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The packaging is very attractive. We get a cardboard box with an up-scaled LEGO plate piece in yellow as its lid. Sadly, the box is not meant for play and depending on where you store it, it may be susceptible to environmental degradation faster than other storage methods. Still all 4 sides of the box are used to display all the possible build options with the parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside you will find a handful of bags for each major color type included in this set. Not all of the builds are available in the instructions, however, so you will have to go to the official set&#39;s page to get the rest online.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are all very handy and getting multiples of this set will allow for greater variety. On its own, however, the parts do their job in inspiring creation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Builds and possibilities:</strong></p>

<p>The included builds are modest, given the piece types but there are enough of them that you can make a great variety of small little builds to your hearts content.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Here are the builds included in the manual:</em></p>

<p>Now with all of these built you will still have a modest amount of parts remaining which you can use to make the additional builds featured online or something of your own.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>This set is quite handy for even veteran builders as the price makes it worthy of an impulse buy and its contents will only bolster your preexisting parts count.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For new comers this set offers a great deal of variety and colors to get that creative itch going. Even random structures being built from this thing are great fun and it is relaxing to just sit down and try to see what all can be done with these pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also found the small grocery shop facade to be totally adorable. I placed it next to my park in my city set up just because it looks like a small farmer&#39;s grocer and the colors are bright and attractive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are trying to get a young builder to graduate from Duplo this set would be good start along with one of the small City starter sets. The price would be reasonable and the fun only limited by the use of imagination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building experience wasn&#39;t really great, but the pencil and eraser builds were interesting and what brought my eyes to this set. The price is ok, but the Classic sets aren&#39;t really interesting. The playability is alright for the vehicles and other items you can build. Parts are ok.</p>
