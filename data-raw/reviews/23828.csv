<p>The set comes in three numbered bags. Bag one builds most of the truck, bag two adds the clutter to the truck bed and the trailer. Bag three is dedicated the porta-loo.</p>

<p>The two minifigures are pretty standard construction site workers. One in worker orange, one in foreman shirt with suspenders, utility belt, and tie. &nbsp;Of note is that the worker comes with the new style helmet with headset.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Construction of the truck from bag one is pretty straight forward. Front and rear bumper is made using basic SNOT techniques. The steps facilitating access to the cab is made using some plates with slides. If you have built any Lego trucks the last decade you pretty much know what to expect.</p>

<p>Bag two finishes off the truck and adds the trailer. In addition to the crane, the set comes with a good selection of stuff to add to the bed. Two barriers,a jackhammer, a broom, a shovel, a fire extinguisher, a trash can and a small control stick for the crane leaves the bed looking properly cluttered.</p>

<p>The trailer, as the truck, is an unsurprising and straight forward build. As with the truck, SNOT techniques are utilised for the rear bumper. The finished trailer is pleasantly sleek. It has the feel of something a minifigure could push around. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag three delivers the porta-loo, a.k.a. the reason you bought this set. And it&rsquo;s a beaut. Somebody went to a lot of trouble when designing this to make it as small as possible given the restrictions posed by a standard Lego door. It uses the new flat, round 2x2 with hole in a clever way. It utilises the 5/6 geometry inherit in Lego for the SNOT sides. It&rsquo;s also light enough that the crane can swing it a god bit to the side of the truck without the truck tipping over. Not all the way mind, but enough for the porta-loo to clear the trailer.</p>

<p>Lastly, it offers an excuse for the lames &ldquo;accessory&rdquo; in the history of LEGO sets. Quote the set description: &nbsp;&ldquo;Accessories include [...] toilet paper&rdquo;. &nbsp;What you get is a round brick, 1x1 in white.</p>

"PeteM","2015-03-29T13:51:28.607Z","A Pleasant Surprise","<p>Full disclosure before I begin &ndash; I usually completely ignore Lego City sets. Not that I dislike the theme, but trivial things like limited budget and storage mean that I have to concentrate my money and time elsewhere to avoid bankruptcy and divorce. However, I caught sight of it on the shelf and the lure of owning a Lego portable toilet proved just too strong&hellip;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art literally exploits the toilet humour inherent in the set, with one of the minifigures shown being disturbed mid session in the portaloo. Though the question of why he needs to be wearing ear defenders sends the mind reeling...</p>

<p>The instructions are in a single booklet and, in line with the 5-12 ages guidance, are straightforward and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are fairly standard fare and sadly none are printed &ndash; instead you get a reasonably compact sticker sheet with the usual array of red and white striped &lsquo;hazard&rsquo; markings, number plates etc. More uniquely, there are also three of the instantly recognisable male/female signs which go on 2x2 tiles on the outside of the portaloo.</p>

<p>There is also a wide but unexciting selection of plates and tiles which go into the truck itself, primarily in the yellow and grey colour scheme of the vehicle. I&rsquo;m not sure why a few of the elements are included, such as the tan jumper plates which get buried in the chassis without exploiting their &lsquo;jumperness&rsquo;, but anything that increases the range of parts available for future use elsewhere is a good thing in my book.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Both of the minifigures included feature detailed printing on the front and back of their torsos. One is an unusually smartly dressed chap, sporting a tie, braces and belt, tucked into which is a ruler in case he needs to draw any straight lines in a hurry. He also gets the standard hard hat, but I assume that he&rsquo;s a site foreman, or possibly a rather hands-on architect (hence the ruler).</p>

<p>The second is a more generic City worker, clad in orange overalls that are covered in practical-looking pockets, as well as a shiny &lsquo;Hi-Vis&rsquo; stripe. HIs hard hat is a new piece which has the ear defenders moulded into the design rather than being an extra accessory as in previous years.&nbsp; He also gets a drill piece to play with.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As expected in a set of this level, there isn&rsquo;t anything particularly complicated or innovative in this build and the whole thing is over in about 30 minutes. Having said that, it&rsquo;s never boring &ndash; not least as I am more used to the Town sets of the 1980s, so the sheer density of parts involved in constructing the chassis was a surprise to me. The set is incredibly solid and the move to six-stud-wide gives scope for some interesting &lsquo;greebling&rsquo; on the sides of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The portakabin construction is clever in it&rsquo;s compactness, successfully fitting everything into a 4x4 stud floorspace. It seems that every time a toilet is included in a Lego set it is built differently and this is no exception &ndash; using a white lifebuoy mounted on a round 2x2 tile with a centre hole to construct the &lsquo;bowl&rsquo; and a plain white round 2x2 tile mounted on the back wall as a raised lid. The blue walls around the outside are secured via some sideways building using brackets, giving the whole thing a pleasingly chunky appearance.</p>

<h3>The completed model and Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The completed model definitely lived up my expectations, though as these were based almost entirely on the charms of a Lego portable toilet, you may wish to take that with a grain of salt!</p>

<p>The van itself is a very solid , detailed and well-built vehicle, not particularly &lsquo;juniorised&rsquo; in appearance and featuring enough accessories on the back that it&rsquo;s very playable all by itself. This includes a broom, shovel, fire extinguisher, barriers and a green bin, as well as a control panel with lever for the lift arm. The use of click hinges for the mechanical arm is less than optimal as they are slightly awkward to operate and never seem to be &lsquo;click&rsquo; into the right position. Having said that, they are strong enough to hold the toilet aloft and the van is well balanced enough that it doesn&rsquo;t immediately tip on it&rsquo;s side. When being towed, the toilet sits on jumper plates on the trailer which hold it in place, but still allow it to be easily removed when required.</p>

<p>The set fits perfectly into a City layout, and doesn&rsquo;t even seem out of scale against some of the Modular buildings. It&rsquo;s an enjoyable little set which adds something a bit different to what the usual construction vehicles bring &ndash; I&rsquo;m very glad I bought it and will be keeping a closer eye on future City sets for little gems like this one.</p>

"Hobbythom","2015-08-11T09:19:59.86Z","A great addition to any LEGO town. As a model and as a parts pack.","<p>While visiting a local lego store my eye fell on this set. Normally I do not often buy vehicles, being more of a building guy, but the inclusion of the port-a-loo (or Dixie as we call it in the Netherlands) peaked my interest. So, I decided to pick it up and am glad that I did.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Your typical box with typical instructions. Parts come in three bags and one compact sticker sheet is included. I am normally quite selective in applying stickers, but in this case I applied them all. They go on easliy available parts (with exception of the crane) and are very usefull (the toilet sign).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts selection is quite good with some useful and even rare pieces. There are quite a lot of snot bricks, there is the toilet seat (which is quite rare) and of course the grey door which for a change does not have a window in it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with two minifigs. Your run of the mill construction worker in orange overalls (who has a cap with ear protectors) and a foreman with a very nice torso.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I enjoyed the build. The truck is a fairly complex build to create a detailed construction. The toilet is simpler to build but nevertheless uses some nice SNOT work (nothing to complex).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like the completed model. It is a very nice service truck which you can have driving around town providing quite a few services with the provided parts. For bigger towns, you could easily have two or three of these. Load it up with bins, a tree trunk, bicycles or piping and you create different utility vehicles.</p>

<p>The only improvement I could think of was maybe the addition of side supports for when the crane is used. This would add a touch of realism. It is no big deal though and the model is fine without.</p>

<p>The toilet is a great build to place near a construction site or even a train platform. Alternatively, you could integrate the toilet in a building of your own and still have great truck left to provide services to the inhabitants of your town.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great little set with great value for money. Recommended.</p>

"Gerbil","2015-08-01T18:17:59.783Z","I know why you want this set, and you really should buy it!","<p>We all know why you want this set.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It has a portaloo. What more do you need? And it is fantastic.</li>
	<li>Comes with a lot of nice accessories for the back of the lorry.</li>
	<li>Have I mentioned the portaloo yet? :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Stickers, and lots of them.</li>
	<li>At least in my case, the crane rapidly lost its clutch power and can no longer lift the portaloo alone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>The portaloo is fantastic. Fitting everything into a box barely bigger than the door itself was a work of inspiration, and yet it doesn&#39;t lack detail. The toilet looks great, it has a button to flush and toilet paper. Any minifig&nbsp;automatically looks awesome when sat inside :) Oh, and the set comes with a decent looking truck with trailer to haul it too! This extra comes with plenty of accessories, and the variety here means this set on its own offers great play value.</p>

<p>Final comment: It has an excelent portaloo. If you haven&#39;t already bought it, you should be on your way to a store to get it right now!</p>

"andyh1984","2016-08-18T12:19:46.553Z","Little touches make a great set.","<p>Everyone who looks at this set will see the portaloo but there is more to this set than that</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard City box showing set and play features</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I can&#39;t see any special or unusual parts but a couple are used in unusual ways like the white 1x1 cylinder used as a toilet roll and the toilet seat is a&nbsp;piece i remember as a floating life ring in my sons coast-guard sets from a few years back. A lot of MOC builders will like the stickers for the side of the portaloo, with a few sets of stickers&nbsp;and some 4x8 plates in different colours&nbsp;you could make a row of portaloos for your Lego festival or construction site.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get a site foreman type minifigure and a worker with the newish hat with ear protectors (moulded as one piece) with his grey hoodie underneath his hi-vis&nbsp;top</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>you start with the truck and work front to rear finishing with the portaloo.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is a nice looking set and the blue portaloo will make it stand out against other construction vehicles and there are various bits and pieces filling the truck bed, 2 barriers for when using the crane, a bin/trash can, a pneumatic drill, a sweeping brush,&nbsp;fire extinguisher&nbsp;and the crane controls. I particularly like the crane which folds up tidily against the back of the truck like a real one.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is my first construction theme set and I am thoroughly impressed by the whole of it, the truck and accessories are great and the yellow is a&nbsp;good contrast to the blue of the portaloo and the fact you can use the crane to move the portaloo&nbsp;means this is a really well designed set at a reasonable cost.</p>
