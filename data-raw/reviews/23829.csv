<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Small box. Easy instructions i guess. Have not build any of the 3. Went straight on to building my own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>67. Do not know if they are rare. The 4 orange 1x1 cones stands out. They are the real challenge/stars of this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Have not build any of the 3. But with 67 parts I will call it easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Have not build it. &nbsp;This set is perfect for making alternates.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Best Creator set so far in 2015. Especially in the category &#39;Value for money&#39; and &#39;Playability&#39;</p>

"ChickenMan","2015-11-18T09:55:44.243Z","Pocket-Money set with dozens of awesome potential builds!","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Small box with &ldquo;punch hole&rdquo; opening on rear. Box art shows all 3 of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; buildable models on the front and back. Inside is a single booklet containing instructions for all three builds, with the usual parts list at the back and photos of other selected 2015 Creator sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>67 pieces, mostly&nbsp;in white, blue, red or medium / dark grey, in a single clear bag. Includes 4 of the orange<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4518029""> 4518029 </a>nose-cone pieces, and one of the <a href=""http://4631877"">4631877</a> 1x4 plate pieces with 2 knobs, which was useful to have for my collection. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4621178"">4621178</a> rims look great and are unusual and useful, having previously been seen mostly in Pixar Cars sets. No stickers included.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As you&#39;d expect no minifigures are included but one of the &quot;official&quot; builds, a Go-Kart / Buggy, is in &quot;minifigure&quot; scale and can take a seated minifig if you have one to hand.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Five minutes per design, very simple.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The first build is the &ldquo;Blue Racer&rdquo;. For such a small model, it&rsquo;s both interesting and detailed; racing stripes, front and rear headlights, and a great spoiler section that hinges up to reveal a rear-mounted engine. For a 7cm long model, they packed a lot in. The second build, the &ldquo;Snow-Plough&rdquo;, is the weakest of the three &ndash; somehow it doesn&rsquo;t quite &ldquo;work&rdquo; as a design. It looks odd and out of proportion, and with &ldquo;racing-car&rdquo; parts perhaps Lego should have gone with something that better fitted what was available. The third variant, the &ldquo;Buggy&rdquo;, a sort of motorised Go-Kart, is excellent &ndash; great racing styling, rear engine, adjustable seat, and you can even fit a minifigure on it. It reminded me of a 2015 version of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6609-1/Race-Car"">1980&rsquo;s 6609 Race Car</a>, which I have fond memories of.</p>

<p>The great thing about this set is that there are dozens of frankly awesome potential builds linked through from Brickset &ndash; at the moment there are 67 of them listed on Alt.Builds &nbsp;- many of them in my opinion much better than the 3 official designs and which will give hours of building / playing entertainment. The sheer variety of possibilities is an awesome example of just what a great toy Lego is &ndash; and for &pound;4.99 how could that be a bad thing?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For the variety of possible builds, the great design of 2 of the official builds, &nbsp;and the price, &nbsp;this is an awesome little set. Pick it up!</p>
