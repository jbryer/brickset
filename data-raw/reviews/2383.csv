For such a small set you get all of the rockraiders team except for the leader, plus it includs tools for them. The brown rock looks good and can store the neon stone easily and its easy to open. The minifigslook good and can be used for many differnt Moc's. All in all a great set for rockraiders. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"deluckybrick","2007-07-23T18:35:14.057Z","Needed for Rock Raiders, if you dont want to spend a ton of cash.","This set is inexpensive, so no risk there.  You get all the minifigs you need, and you pay a fraction of the price then for the whole collection.

Pros:
-About $6
-Plenty of minifigs
-Cool tools
-Rock with Brickonium

Cons:

"hustla187","2007-08-14T19:05:15.787Z","Good and cheap set.","This set would be $5 when it was first released. It came with 5 minifigs, a rock, and a little tool shed. There is absolutely positvely a good set to buy if you are a Rock Raiders fan like I am. Definitely a 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2008-07-23T17:17:15.437Z","The rock raiders story line","This is a summary of the story line for the series, followd by a quick review of the set.

The storyline for the series is about an intergalactic mining squad called the Rock Raiders, who, traveling aboard the massive mothership the LMS Explorer (perhaps the LMS means Lego Media Systems...), get hit by an incoming meteor being pulled into a massive black hole, sending them into the wormhole as well, rocketing them across the Universe to another unkown galaxy. Since the ship's systems are damaged they are unable to return without the required fuel, energy crystals. Geological scanners detect that the nearby terrestrial planet is loaded with the crystals they need. The ship stations itself over the planet, teleporting down a team of miners and geologists, who go forth to mine out the crystals. The planet contains many underground rivers, lava flows, caverns, and in some cases, arctic-like regions deep underground. They must collect all the necessary materials in order to repair the ship and return home. The six characters (five of which are in this set) are as follows: Jet, the pilot (female); Axle the driver (black torso, brown helmet); sparks the engineer (orange, you can't miss him); Bandit the Helmsman and Boatsman (red torso); Docs the geologist (dark gray with bandana); and the cheif (not included, hard to find).

This set has the five characters, sparks is actuall pretty rare, and so is this set. Now it is much more expensive than ever, but at its original price (approx. $10) was a steal! The set has loads of tools and a control panel, as well as five, yes five (5!), minifigures. This is an excellent booster pack, very similar to the unnaturaly coveted star wars battle packs. For any collector, this is a must have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Yoda____","2008-10-28T14:31:33.903Z","Classic","This set is a classic it has loads of figures and afew accesories but there isn't realy any building in it so I gave it a 4. If you see this anywhere just buy it, there's no reason why not to, if it's cheap because on the other hand there isn't any reason to get it. If you're possitive and see it at a low price then get it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ROCK_RAIDER_GUY","2009-03-05T16:33:58.263Z","Great!!","My First R and R set. This was a really good set. All the Characters in one set with some extras. I got this a Zellars for 99 cents

"chemxcore","2009-04-26T15:53:34.123Z","YES","I never owned any rock raiders except for this minifig pack.  I regret this tremendously, as these are THE BEST MINIFIGS EVER CREATED.  I don't know what it is, but they are just great.  I was at the cusp of my lego dark ages, this may have been one of the last sets I purchased (right before high school started.)  I think now I am back on the circuit I will go buy some other sets!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Alexpanter","2009-12-28T02:49:39.263Z","Lego should make more of this kinda sets","I bought this because someone gave me the Rock Raiders PC game. Then I wanted to have some Rock Raiders minifigs. Lego should make more of this kinda   
""all minifigs of the theme+ some tools"" sets. This set has all the ""normal"" Rock Raiders (Sparks, Axle, Jet, Bandit, Docs). However Chief is not in this set :(


Pros:

Minifigs (duh)

A lot of tools (duh too)

Rare tools

Little comic book 


Cons:

Not all tools fit in the tool station :P

Its hard to make Docs stand stable while having his big chainsaw thingie in his hands. A normal plate however can fix this.

We Are Missing CHIEF!

What is a little bit disappointing about this set is that the Rock Raider captain which you've seen in the videogame doesn't appear in this set.
