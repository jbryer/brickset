"LegoHPnut","2014-12-30T01:36:01.517Z","Brainiac Attacks!!!!!","<p>This is definitely the set I was most excited for from the 2015 Justice League wave, and it surely does not disappoint. It strikes the delicate balance between a varied and interesting build and lots of playability with great minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figure selection in this set is just fantastic. Brainiac is easily the crown jewel of this set in terms of figures. His facial expression is an evil sneer that perfectly encapsulates the character and the printing all around his head just adds to this great villain. His torso is also exquisitely detailed with a space suit that looks both high tech and orgainic at the same time.</p>

<p>The other exclusive character to this set is Supergirl, who is just as expected: her legs are red with her skirt and skin tone printed on, but it&#39;s a very solid print. The only gripe I have about her and the other two heroes is the new fabric cape. I can see why LEGO changed the material the capes are made of, and they seem more durable than the previous fabric but they don&#39;t go around the figure&#39;s necks very well. It actually looks like each one of them is wearing a brightly colored turtleneck!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the previous Martian Manhunter figure to compare the two, but this figure does the job just fine. Again, the fabric cape is annoying, but what really gets me is that the part around his head is still made of the old cape material.</p>

<p>Superman is the same figure as in the Power Armor Lex set but with the new cape and the brand new Super Jumper, which works similarly to the bugs in the Hero Factory sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Brainiac&#39;s Ship</h3>

<p>The central ship is very well constructed, with flick fire missiles and a pretty cool-looking skull on the front. It&#39;s a very good representation of Brainiac&#39;s ship as featured in LEGO Batman 3 considering the piece count and price point. Size-wise, it&#39;s about the same height as the previously mentioned Lex Luthor Power Armor. Some of the unique pieces to this set include the metallic silver tentacles that hold the ship up and a rather unique-looking wheel that holds the rays on the right side of the ship.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is an excellent value for $24.99. It has three unique figures and a detailed, extremely playable model at the center. 5/5&nbsp;</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-01-13T01:32:42.117Z","Good Value.","<p>When I first saw images of the 2015 DC sets, I knew this would be the one to get. It has three exclusive minifigures, a cool build, and great play value.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is an unusual shape; it is rather tall and not long as compared to most other sets. It is also quite thin. The front shows the set in action and the minifig roster with some nice art in the background. The back shows off another action scene as well as instructions for using the Super Jumper, which is advertised several times on the box. My instruction booklet was folded in half, but smoothed out easily. There were no errors in the book and the back features some advertisements for other LEGO themes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t that many interesting parts, and I think the only new one is the piece that hinges the cockpit. There are hardly any System pieces. I assume many people will make MOCs with the tentacles.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are the highlight of the set, like any DC set. I will start with <strong>Brainiac. </strong>While Brainiac is undoubtedly the star of this set as well as the new videogame, I would argue that he is not the best figure included. His head has printing on both sides, one featuring his arrogant smirk as well as some head-technology stuff. The other side continues the technology print, but has no face. Brainiac&#39;s torso is highly detailed and has a metal suit printed on both sides with some wires running up it. I was disappointed to see that his legs were plain. This, perhaps, is the only downfall of this figure.</p>

<p>Next is <strong>Martian Manhunter,</strong> who I expect most people will want out of these four because he is a founder of the JLA. J&#39;onn J&#39;onzz features great head and torso printing, which in my opinion are far superior to the polybag version. Like Brainiac, he sadly features no leg printing. Other than that, my only complaint with the figure is, not only does it use the dumb new cape, it also uses the OLD material for the collar, so it looks totally different.</p>

<p><strong>Supergirl </strong>is next. She features a common hair piece in what I believe is a new color. She is one of two figures with a double-head; one side has a neutral/happy expression, while the other is angry and has her Kryptonian heat vision active. While her highly-detailed torso is similar to Superman&#39;s, Supergirl&#39;s legs are very different. They feature a red skirt and red boots with some skin showing in between. Since the piece is cast in red, the skin color has to be painted on and I was happy to find that the red did not bleed through and affect the color. My only complaint is that Supergirl also features the new style cape.</p>

<p>Last, and certainly least, is <strong>Superman. </strong>This figure is the same one seen in the Lex Luthor set, with the exception of the head, which is the double-sided Man of Steel version, and the cape, which is also in the new fabric like the others.</p>

<p>With the exception of Superman, who most people most likely have by now, the minifigure selection for this set is superb and surprisingly a lot for a $25 set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is non too challenging, although there are quite a few sections where Technic is utilized. Constructing this set takes 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great, although it is smaller than I was expecting. It only clocks in around four minifigs high. There were five stickers, but I do feel that they are somewhat necessary to get the full feel of the set. The Super Jumper feature is fun, but it is very hard to knock down the ray gun. The skull on the front of the ship is my favorite part of the set, and I may take it off for display or recreate it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is well worth the money because you get three exclusive figures and a cool vehicle. I would buy it if you see it, because as of writing this it is rather hard to come by compared to the other DC sets.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T21:49:39.053Z","Brainiac vs Superman","<p><strong>Set #76040 Brainiac Attack: </strong>A Target exclusive in the States it was fortunate that Canada had Target for a brief time, now LEGO Store is the only place to find this set in Canada. This is a great set for the price and it includes four Minifigures, none of which are Batman, which is a great plus. You&rsquo;ll definitely want to pick this set up and the reasons why follow in this review.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: The box design is the same as we&rsquo;ve come to expect from this Theme, the only difference is the new Justice League logo instead of Batman. This box does a good job of showcasing the features and figures found in this set, the only difference seems to be that being a Target exclusive means the upper corner is missing the image of the JL that other DC Super Heroes boxes from 2015 had.</p>

<p>Instructions: A thick booklet which details the build for the model quite nicely. There are no difficult steps, however there are stickers for the printed details, it may be necessary to get some help in placing some of them. The instructions are what you come to expect from LEGO and have no real problems, the cross promotional stuff in the back is standard fare as well, however I&rsquo;m still wondering why they have images for LEGO Movie sets instead of just DC Super Heroes sets.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The parts included in this set feature the new Super Jumper, six silver plastic tentacle pieces a large transparent green dome for the cockpit and standard plates and 1x2 bricks along with other bricks and plates. Overall the set is decent looking when it comes to parts, and the number of parts used in the model is decent for a set of this size.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Superman: The print and everything else about this Minifigure is identical to past Superman Minifigures based on his comic book look, the only difference is the new softer, thinner cape. I don&rsquo;t know what to think about these new capes, they seem flimsier than the more sturdy capes we&rsquo;ve had before, and yet mine hasn&rsquo;t suffered any degradation or damages since purchasing this early in the year. I guess only time will tell.</p>

<p>Supergirl: This Minifigure is brand new and looks awesome, with a unique double-sided torso, a printed set of legs with her trademark red skirt and a nice double-sided facial print with one side regular expression the other heat vision mode, much like her cousin. Supergirl looks powerful and great, and it&rsquo;s nice to see her brought into the staple of female super heroes. Now if we could get a few more of them. She also has the flimsier cape.</p>

<p>Martian Manhunter: If you missed out on the Polybag promotional version of the Manhunter you&rsquo;re in luck, because this is a much easier method of acquiring the character in Minifigure form. J&rsquo;Onn J&rsquo;onnzz includes a double-sided green torso with his trademark red straps and belt, his legs are plain and unprinted, his facial print looks perfect as well with a stoic expression. He uses two cape pieces, the larger cape piece is the flimsier material while the upper cape/collar piece is the same colour, but the older material. A combination of the two works out nicely, hopefully there won&rsquo;t be any issues with this new cape material.</p>

<p>Brainiac: First came Lex Luthor, then General Zod, now we have Superman&rsquo;s third most recognized arch nemesis, the super computer Brainiac. His Minifigure form includes a double-sided torso print with mechanical detailing, a pair or plain black legs and a lime green head with printing on the front and some on the back. It&rsquo;s great to finally get Brainiac in Minifigure form and he looks suitably menacing, it is interesting to note that none of these Minifigures include any accessories.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This was a fun build, the model is lifted straight out of LEGO Batman 3 Beyond Gotham and while it isn&rsquo;t an exact 100% match to the on-screen counterpart, it&rsquo;s fairly close. The steps to building it are enjoyable and don&rsquo;t include any frustrating or tricky moments. The biggest problem you might come across is the build section used as part of the play feature, as it is meant to be loosely built and doesn&rsquo;t solidly connect.</p>

<p>The use of stickers for the printed details are either hit or miss, I guess it depends on your ultimate preferences and if stickers really bother you that much. Personally it doesn&rsquo;t bother me nearly as much, what I find more bothersome is when the sheet is unprotected in the package and can be damaged when packaging, which can result in peeling or unsightly creases that interfere with the look of the set when applied.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This model is clearly designed based on the vehicle from the third LEGO Batman videogame. It is a brilliant looking design with six tendrils hanging down from a saucer-like main body, a very impressive looking skull design on the front. The large dome on top to cover the pilot&rsquo;s section is a nice looking bubble reminiscent of classic Space themed sets. The play features of this set are rather limited compared to others, you have a flick-fire missile on one side of the cockpit, while the other has Brainiac&rsquo;s shrink ray attached via two loose technic axles. Why loose? Because you&rsquo;re meant to use the Super Jumper included with this set to have one of the heroes launch into it and disable it.</p>

<p>The use of stickers for details is a bit unfortunate, however the model doesn&rsquo;t suffer too badly for this because there aren&rsquo;t many surface details on the ship to begin with. The engines are a nice solid little section as well. Really impressive model.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Great set from LEGO, not only does it offer up a bunch of awesome characters we haven&rsquo;t seen much of up to this point, but the model is a really impressive and functional vessel for Brainiac to use. It looks very close to the model in the game, if not entirely accurate, minus the play feature involving the Super Jumper of course. As it is a Target exclusive it&rsquo;s price is pretty good too, being only 30$ this is a great deal for what you&rsquo;re getting here. Strongly recommend it if you haven&rsquo;t gotten this one yet, definitely makes a great Christmas present as well.</p>
