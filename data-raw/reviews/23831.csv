This set is the second smallest and features many smaller builds all pooled together to make up a scene from Agrabah. Overall it&rsquo;s a nicely designed set for play and display and includes a decent Mini-Doll, let&rsquo;s cover all the bases as per usual shall we?</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box/Instructions</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: The box is nicely designed, much like all of the Disney Princess sets, and it features a lovely image of Jasmine on the front in a shimmering blue outfit, what you see on the front is basically what you get and&hellip;some of it is questionable. The back showcases the set&rsquo;s contents as well as it could, however it really shows just how much weaker this set is compared to some of the others. As a nice nod to the previous years&rsquo; sets Cinderella and Rapunzel get to stay in the group shot of the Princess Mini-Dolls at the bottom, adding Jasmine, Aurora, Elsa and Anna to the group, but losing Merida, which is odd.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: This set does the unusual of breaking up the build between two manuals when it honestly shouldn&rsquo;t need to be, Bag 1 is in manual 1 which is a smaller, thinner number while manual 2 covers everything in bag 2 and is much larger and thicker. Breaking it up here seems quite pointless in all honesty as the first manual is barely twenty-pages long. As the second manual is about 30 pages long breaking it up was a bit silly, I guess a 50 page manual in this type of set would be asking too much.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The second manual includes a shot of all the Disney Princess sets from this new batch as well as the Cinderella castle from the first year of releases. No checkboxes, just a shot of each set and the Mini-Dolls found in them. A small number of stickers are included for details.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set features a few typical parts from the LEGO Friends line, some nice purples and pinks of course. What stands out the most however in my mind are the printed tile pieces with the markings for the buildable Carpet character and the two gold half-domes used in a lot of Middle Eastern building design.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minidoll</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Jasmine: Jasmine gets a lovely new lower torso design for her unique pant style attached to an upper torso with a great print showing her small halter top trimmed with lace and her golden necklace, there is a small jewel in the center of her chest as well. She receives a brilliant new hair piece which captures the look of her design brilliantly and includes some added earrings for details. Overall a great looking mini-doll, unfortunately she doesn&rsquo;t receive any accessories to hold, you can give her some from the models, such as the lamp or Raja&rsquo;s meal, however she isn&rsquo;t given anything herself.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: This bag includes Jasmine, the Magic Carpet, Raja and all of the models necessary to make a small Bazaar with a feeding area for Raja. You&rsquo;ll also find a pedestal with the Magic Lamp on it, but no Genie in sight. There isn&rsquo;t much to any of the builds here, the most you&rsquo;ll have to worry about is applying a single sticker to a tile piece for the front of the Bazaar stand. Everything else should be simplicity itself.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: This features a lot more detailed building for Jasmine&rsquo;s little palace structure and a small water fountain, again though the build is relatively quick and the only real bit that could be difficult is placing the sticker properly on the half-cylinder pieces for the window detailing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Palace: This model is the largest in the set and while it does look nice enough it is definitely a bit of a weaker model compared to similar sets in this Theme. The interior is missing a lot of details for a palace, you basically are left with a fa&ccedil;ade, which is typical in these Themes, however the space isn&rsquo;t large enough for Jasmine to entertain any of her fellow Disney Princesses.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There is a wide balcony on top for someone to stand on, still though it might have been better to lose some of the non-essentials in this set and make the castle a bit wider in the back to accommodate more dolls. There isn&rsquo;t even enough room for Jasmine and Raja to sit comfortably, in-spite of there being a small pillow on the ground for sitting and a table off to the side with a jeweled perfume bottle.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bazaar Stand: This stand is built quite similarly to many others found in LEGO Friends sets. It has a small awning using 1x2 sloped bricks of purple and dark pink and includes a few more jeweled perfume bottles for sale, plus a small green stud which might be some kind of jade gem, though it doesn&rsquo;t sparkle like the bottles. A pretty fun looking addition to the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Water Fountain: This is a nice looking model too, and it uses the parts to perfect effect for a small fountain near the palace. It&rsquo;s about as tall as a Mini-Doll without the water element in the centre, so it does seem a bit small, however wasting water so extravagantly in the desert is often frowned upon.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Carpet: As a buildable character Carpet here looks almost perfect, due to the fact that a jumper plate and a Mini-Doll leg clip piece is in the middle the printed detailing doesn&rsquo;t carry over his surface as it does in the movie, so it does look a bit jarring when nobody is riding him. Still it&rsquo;s a very clever use of parts to actually make the flying carpet and it does give you another character from the movie to play with Jasmine and Raja.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Accessories: The lamp stand is fairly simple, and as a model works well, the use of the magic lamp piece here is a nice addition, it doesn&rsquo;t have much to say about it separately though. As part of the Bazaar sales items you also get a golden lightsaber hilt and a barrel with a green serpent inside, a bit silly, but it adds more to the set I guess.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Raja uses the LEGO Friends cat animal piece to decent effect. It is in no way screen accurate, but it fits the aesthetic of LEGO Disney Princess to a T and I adore the print for Raja&rsquo;s face. Raja gets his own place to have fun with, a small shading tree with two palm fronds on top and a piece of chicken/turkey leg to nibble on. The tree is a bit too short and uses small brown cylinder pieces instead of the larger tree trunk-like parts, however it adds another piece of scenery to the overall look of the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">In my opinion, this set, for the price it has, is a really mixed bag. This has a load of stand alone elements to play with and many younger fans might enjoy it, however I feel that this set is missing a crucial element. The palace is fairly small for something meant to be a palace, it&rsquo;s no Agrabah palace from the movie, however it would have been nice to at least see a larger interior with better details and more to do, allowing Jasmine to entertain guests from other Disney Princess sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">All of the extras, the Bazaar stand and the like are take it or leave it elements, and why is Jasmine going to buy a snake in a barrel or a gold lightsaber hilt? It just seems like having something extra for the point of upping the piece count. Carpet is great though, and I do appreciate that Jasmine has Raja even if it is the reduced to a cub version after Jafar takes over. Her mini-doll looks beautiful as well and her hair piece is great.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I would recommend this set on sale, at 25$ the contents inside is just a bit lackluster and too disjointed compared to other sets from the Theme, Merida got a better structure to play in and still fit in a bunch of extras, for the same price, so why not Jasmine?</span></span></span></span></p>
