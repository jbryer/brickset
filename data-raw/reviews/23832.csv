<p>Gracie aged 4 (nearly 5) built this set in a little over an hour. She was so excited to build the set from her favourite movie, singling-a-long during the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall Gracie scored it 5 out of 5</p>

<h3><em><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></em></h3>

<p>Box sells the set very well, great colours and &#39;sparkles&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em><strong>Parts</strong></em></h3>

<p>Some unique parts and &#39;glitter&#39; is back.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em><strong>Minifigures</strong></em></h3>

<p>Can&#39;t argue it&#39;s Disney Frozen, including a snowman named Olaf</p>

<h3><em><strong>The build</strong></em></h3>

<p>Gracie really enjoyed the build and would happily build all again straight away. She struggled with some of the slope pieces but she is under the recommended age of the set. After seeing the Lego Ideas Esla&nbsp;Ice Castle we were a little disappointed with the size, we thought it could be much bigger and would easily sell just as well if the price were higher.&nbsp;</p>

<p>?Gracie was really happy of the final model so happy parents too!</p>

<h3><em><strong>The completed model</strong></em></h3>

<p>A little play feature here and there help with the completed model. Although aimed for boys and girls I am sure the frozen fans will love this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><em><strong>Overall opinion</strong></em></h3>

<p>5 out of 5, it&#39;s Disney, it&#39;s frozen, despite the size you can&#39;t really go wrong. Gracie loved it.&nbsp;</p>

"PeteM","2017-01-27T22:10:36.11Z","Do You Want To Build A Sparkling Ice Castle?","<p>To be honest this kind of set usually passes&nbsp;completely over my head - or at least it used to.&nbsp;Now that&nbsp;my nearly-three year old daughter has a finely honed visual radar for anything Frozen themed,&nbsp;she talked of little else but this set for months after spotting it on the Lego shelves of our local supermarket. Despite my wife frowning at her being four years under the youngest recommended age, I was keen to encourage any KFOL inclinations so it was duly purchased (when found at a decent discount) for Christmas.</p>

<h3>An AFOL Perspective</h3>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong> I&#39;ve mentioned that I&#39;m not usually drawn to this kind of set, but AFOLs can find something of interest in nearly any Lego box and this was no exception. The most obvious place to start is the parts and this set doesn&#39;t disappoint. The new glitter-encrusted pieces were completely new to me and I have to admit that they do look pretty good and could easily find use in winter or ice themed models. The most useful rare pieces are probably the light aqua spiral stair pieces which would fit into a variety of castle or building MOCs quite easily. Add to this a smattering of pieces in trans-light blue and white of varying sizes, and there is a good selection of parts for expanding a Winter Village scene, albeit in limit quantity.</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong> Due to my daughter&#39;s age, I completed most of the build due to both her still-developing co-ordination skills not being up to it, as well as a limited attention span which older children may not suffer from (there is a reason for that 6-12 recommendation!). It was nothing too complex, though the positioning and temporary instability of some of it during construction might cause issues with those significantly under recommended age bracket. The sticker placement was surprisingly straightforward and the shiny foil effect does add a welcome bit of icy shine to what would otherwise be dull white wall pieces.</p>

<p><strong>My initial overall opinion:</strong> It&#39;s . . . okay. Even if I had given it a proper look I probably wouldn&#39;t have bought it without the pressure of pester power. A fan of the film will appreciate the accurately detailed figures (more of which below), but the final model looks nothing like the structure in the film that it represents which might cause disappointment. It&#39;s smaller than I would expect, lacks the quantity of interesting parts for a decent parts pack (especially at RRP) and the build is nothing special in itself. However, that&#39;s just me and I&#39;m not the target audience. So, on to:</p>

<h3>A Frozen-obsessed Two Year Old&#39;s Perspective</h3>

<p>My daughter absolutely adores this set - we&#39;re now 27 days into January and she has played with it or parts of it every day since we built it on Christmas Day. I&#39;m often roped into her games - someone has to be Anna - and seeing what she gets out of it has changed the way I perceive the set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong> It is the Anna and Elsa minidolls that are at the centre of most of my daughter&#39;s games. The faces capture the characters well and the printing on the dresses and torsos is accurate to the costumes from the film to my eye. Both have cloaks - Elsa gets a slightly flashier one with a shiny glitter effect, though it tends to revolve freely around her neck during play as the plait on the hairpiece isn&#39;t long enough to trap it in place. And it&#39;s a bit of a shame that, as Elsa is usually portrayed with a long plait over her shoulder, this couldn&#39;t have been recreated, but it doesn&#39;t seem to bother my daughter (the light blue &#39;fire&#39; element representing Elsa&#39;s ice-producing magical powers more than makes up for it). Olaf the snowman is mostly constructed from standard parts, but with a specially molded head. Due to the domed 2x2 brick for his base and the &#39;carrot top&#39; bits for hands, he&#39;s not that mobile or poseable, but he is a welcome addition.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong> Having built the set, my main worry was that it didn&#39;t have many of the usual play features that I thought would be needed to keep my daughter entertained. Needless to say I was wrong - for her, this is all about the activities of the minidolls, so anything that can be used to interact with these is where the fun lies. The sleigh is fairly robust and, though the little skis occasionally fall off the bottom if subjected to too much rough play, they are easily reattached. The curious little ice slope is very solid and, thanks to it&#39;s size, can be used by both skiers and for launching the sleigh down. The moveable staircase is just perfect - it can be slowly unfurled to represent the moment Elsa creates it, left in place for moving characters between floors, and rolled back to allow easy access to play in the ground floor area.</p>

<p>Some of the design choices are interesting - I have seen the film a lot recently (and I mean A LOT) and I have no memory of Elsa&#39;s Castle featuring an ice cream dispenser at any point. Proving that this is where my judgment lapses, this is one of the highlights for my daughter who loves getting the ice cream and ice lolly pieces out so that Elsa and Anna can enjoy a delicious chilled dessert moment between all their skiing and sledging.</p>

<p>The use of lavender pieces is more jarring - I&#39;ve no idea why these couldn&#39;t have been replaced with more appropriately snowy or icy colours, but I suppose it makes it more visually interesting. Most fundamentally, it really doesn&#39;t look much like the castle in the film, though at the piece count and price point this is an understandable compromise. And arguably it really doesn&#39;t matter - it is a close-enough representative structure upon which either film-inspired or completely original stories can unfold, and on those terms it works splendidly judging by my daughter&#39;s as-yet-unabated enthusiasm for the set.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>This is a set that is understandably wildly popular with the target market and, having seen the effect it has on my daughter, I can fully understand why. It&#39;s a little expensive at full UK RRP, though this is quickly forgotten as it allows such scope for story and minidoll-based imaginative play. It doesn&#39;t need the exciting kinetic features of action themes or the interesting part selection and build techniques of Creator-like sets - when taken simply as a stage set for an imaginative child (or adult) to bring the minidolls to life, it is (contrary to my unfair initial observations) absolutely a success.</p>
