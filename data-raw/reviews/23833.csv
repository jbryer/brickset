<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was surprisingly small and the instructions are about half of its size. But you don&#39;t care about those unless you save them like me so onto the review!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are lots of hard to find brown and orangish-brown pieces in this set. The color scheme looks great and you have four of the missle launcher pieces, four of black connector pieces with a two-stud long axle part and a one-stud long circle connector thingy (I don&#39;t know the official name of it). Tnd had the wheel pieces also look very cool a had a print on them instead of stickers which is always a good thing</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>For the minifigures you have your two standard super battle droids and a clone trooper lieutenant that has a neat light-bluish color.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about 15-20 minutes and wasn&#39;t that hard.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks very good in almost all aspects, except there&#39;s a ball socket piece in the back that I find to be pretty useless. Otherwise it looks great and is very sturdy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is a great set for anybody who likes star wars and collecting pieces, it has lots of playability, detail, and great brown and orangish-brown pieces. The droid is an easy enough built and looks pretty cool. My only problems are it&#39;s a bit expensive for&nbsp;$20&nbsp;and only 163 pieces (it says 171 on here but they&#39;re wrong),&nbsp;I don&#39;t see the point&nbsp;of having that ball-socket piece in the back of it, and the missile pieces fire a bit too easily.</p>

<p>It&#39;s box is REALLY thick and sturdy, which for me is always a good thing. It seems kinda small though.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>4 spring loaded shooters, and it&#39;s wheels stand out mostly. Except that we also get a lot of brown/orange pieces which I think some of them are rare.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are Two Super Battle Droids and a Clone Trooper Lieutenant.</p>

<p>I really like Super Battle Droids minifigs, but they&#39;re pretty much un-posable. Only arms and legs piece can move, and only vertically. Also they&#39;re legs are one piece so it means no walking poses and it sometimes can be hard to make them stand on normal surface.</p>

<p>Clone trooper Lieutenant is awesome! Printings all over him look really good and that helmet piece is simply perfect in my opinion. The area with the vizor shines in a way it makes it look more realistic. It also has little holes for antennas on it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quick and easy, except the segments with wheels that can be a bit annoying to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks awesome. I really like that Lego made it in brighter colors than the movie one. It&#39;s really playable. 4 spring loaded shooters add a lot to this set. It&#39;s two of them on either side with two &quot;fake&quot; ones so it can be attached to it&#39;s core.</p>

<p>However there is not enough missiles to shoot there in my opinion. Hailfire droids are always shown with about 16 missiles on each side. I know that it&#39;s impossible in this scale, but 4 more spring loaded shooters would sure be nice. The &quot;fake&quot; ones could be in middle and it would look and feel a lot better.</p>

<p>You can move it&#39;s wheel up and down a little, but it works best in it&#39;s normal position.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Really good set for parts, as a model of Halifire droid (maybe even better than the normal one) and most importantly as a toy. Needs more missiles, though.</p>
