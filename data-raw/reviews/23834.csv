<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Small box with &ldquo;punch hole&rdquo; opening on rear. Box art shows all 3 of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; buildable models on the front and back. Inside is a single booklet containing instructions for all three builds, with the usual parts list at the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>53 parts, mostly in white, black or orange. Useful parts to have include the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6099483"">6099483</a> 1x2 plate with two shafts, two of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6015891"">6015891</a> holder pieces in black, and various wings and propellers you&#39;d expect in this kind of set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None included although one of the alternate builds, the &quot;swamp boat&quot;, can accommodate a Minifigure in scale.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>All very simple as you&#39;d expect. The sea plane is quite a satisfying build, particularly the clever way they attach the floats to the body of the plane, and the general ways in which detail is introduced even in such a small set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Sea Plane is the most satisfying of the three. For under 50 parts on this build, they put a lot of detail into it; engine detailing, running lights, and great playability. It looks nice, and it has great &quot;swoosh-able&quot; qualities. The Catamaran, the second build, doesn&#39;t quite work; it starts out well but then loses its way (or really, runs out of pieces) and looks chunky when it should look sleek. The &quot;swamp boat&quot;, whilst it could take a Minifigure, is designed in a way that does not allow the Minifigure to grab the throttle control, can&#39;t securely sit on the seat, and ultimately looks a bit square-ish and not quite right. For real inspiration, check out the Alt.Builds listed on above that link through to Rebrickable; there&#39;s some real beauties in there.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Get it for the sea plane variant, and for the &quot;Creator&quot; potential of developing much more satisfying completed models with the parts than the other two alternate builds. I picked mine up in a supermarket. It only costs as much as your lunch, so chuck it in your basket and have some fun.</p>

"Wom","2016-01-08T08:54:56.273Z","Caution when wet","<p>These cheap 3-in-1 Creator sets are some of my favorite&nbsp;sets. In most cases they offer some nice looking vehicles for a small price. The orange color caught my attention directly, but is that all it offers?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The small box shows the three models you can build. The main model is the Sea Plane and according to the photos this is the nicest model as well which you can build. As expected the instructions are included for all three models, which are clear and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Although this set contains a small amount of parts, they are quite diverse. The orange color has been used before in similar sets, so it is possible to combine this model with the Mini Plane from the 5762 set for example (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/5762-1/Mini-Plane"">http://brickset.com/sets/5762-1/Mini-Plane</a>). With a combination of these two you can easily create a larger plane.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set does not contain any minifigures and the models are not compatible for use with minifigs by default. The swamp boat model could be adjusted so it could fit a minifig, but this requires some additional parts not included.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>With a low amount of parts and an target age of 6-12 years this is not a complicated set to build. I do like the way the connection from the floats to the plane itself is made. Its sturdy and looks great. Together with the way the engine is modeled this gives a nice level of detail for such a small model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The alternative models offered by Lego are not to my liking, so I didn&#39;t bother to build those.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once completed you have a nice looking plane which has a great stance on its floats. Its also a nice fit for smaller children who want to play with the plane and let their imagination run free. The model does not break easily and can take a fall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Be aware that the plane actually does not float! ;-)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite the fact that I only can recommend one of the three offered models I can safely recommend you this set. The small price&nbsp;justifies this for a large portion and keeping in mind that these Creator sets are easily combined I would not hesitate and add this one to your collection when you come across it.&nbsp;</p>

"Snail","2018-09-01T13:06:25.497Z","Exceptinally good small set","<p>This little plane is quite special for its size and has above quality for a set that size.</p>

<p>It has a whole lot of details well integrated in such small space &ndash; a 4 cylinder motor, right sized propeller, a cockpit-cabin combination that integrates well, warning lights, water landing gear and a nicely sized tail (where it usually gets hard go keep proportions at that scale).</p>

<p>There are some special parts included where necessary, and the standard parts are used well.</p>

<p>Playability is good, my kids didn&#39;t break it when air-racing, and if so it&#39;s not hard to rebuild as nothing is off the usual.</p>

<p>Got it in a bulk, so i can&#39;t really judge value for money.</p>

<p>One secondary model is nice too &ndash; the sailing boat is rather unique and well executed for the parts available. The other one is ... meh, but okay.</p>
