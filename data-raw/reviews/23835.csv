For just $10, you get over 130 pieces, some of which are rather sizable and somewhat unique. The play pattern seems slightly limited, but I can see kids able to fly the &quot;cargo&quot; around the house or outside for hours upon hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the cargo has more functionality than I expected, using the 1x3x1&nbsp;car door elements to open up some space within&nbsp;the 6-stud long container. It&#39;s enough to stuff a couple of the spare 1x1 pieces included in the set, and that&#39;s just it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being an aviation lover, I hold LEGO&#39;s helicopters to unreasonably high standards. This, to me, does not disappoint. The shaping is superb, and I especially like the cockpit and engine details, particularly the angled engine outlets. All of the rotor lengths seem proportional, which is one of my big gripes with LEGO helicopters- they&#39;re (almost) always too small! The rest of the chopper has a nice color scheme, with the red and trans-black cheese slopes breaking up the yellow fuselage and tail. The 1-stud wide tail looks good, and I like the horizontal stabilizer.</p>

<p>Another small detail I enjoy on the helicopter is the bottom cargo hook&#39;s ability to fold into the body. It seems trivial, but the streamlined look it lends the helicopter when flying without cargo and while it&#39;s on the ground adds a lot to the entire model. There is no interior space to access in the helo; the 4-stud wide fuselage doesn&#39;t open up in any way.</p>

<p>One thing that sets this 3-in-1 apart for its brethren is its reasonable secondary and tertiary builds.&nbsp;I really&nbsp;like the ship. It has the same cargo piece as the helicopter, which fits on the deck with room to spare. The ship&nbsp;immediately recognizable for what it&#39;s trying to be, and the bow, bridge, and&nbsp;stern all look great. It does what it needs to do. The colors are slightly messy, but it&#39;s not so bad as to ruin the build.</p>

<p>The cargo plane in the third build just feels forced; it&#39;s too tall&nbsp;and unproportionally ugly. It retains the same play feature as the helicopter, using a&nbsp;similar&nbsp;cargo build (it&#39;s shorter but holds the same amount of stuff internally), but does so without the aerodynamic appearance I appreciated in the helicopter. I&#39;m being too harsh, though. To make a plane out of a helicopter is admirable, particularly at this scale.</p>

<p>The main standout in this build is the two Yellow&nbsp;Bricks 4X4/18&deg; (Part ID 50373) in yellow. It&#39;s not in many sets, and I forsee it being used in some larger-scale aircraft. LEGO used it in a few Naboo Fighters and even a loader, so some inspiration can be taken from that piece alone if that&#39;s the way you build.</p>

<p>Overall, this set has great value, and buying a few is a great way to establish a &quot;cargo route&quot; of unlimited play without breaking the bank.</p>
