I decided to purchase it anyway, because I love Creator 3-in-1 sets. I&#39;m impressed! I have only built the main model os far, so&nbsp;<strong>this review will only cover the box, instructions, and main model</strong>.</p>

<p><u>Edit</u>: I&#39;ve edited the review to add information on the second (quad) and third (forklift) models.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Regular cardboard box with a &quot;punch-hole&quot; opening, with three instructions booklet - one for each model.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s one part I had never seen before - the 1x4 plate with &#39;teeth&#39; on it. Otherwise, the light blue parts aren&#39;t as common as far as I know.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was simple and fun, as is to be expected for 106 pieces. However, there are pretty clever building techniques here, for the seat backrest, headrest, and steering wheel / front wheel mechanism. The second build uses 1x2 plates with raised hinges for handlebars, which I hadn&#39;t seen before. The build was really simple, but I liked the model. The third build (forklift) has rear wheels that move so you can sort of steer the vehicle as well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is so cool! Not only can you move the seat, but you can steer thanks to the cog attached to the steering wheel mechanism moving the previously&nbsp;mentioned 1x4 groove plate. I&#39;ve never seen a set this simple give us the ability to steer, it was a pleasant surprise!</p>

<p>The second model, the quad, was super simple. I thought it was going to be disappointing but it turned out to be a sturdy little vehicle that is fun to play with.</p>

<p>The third model is a forklift. I had high expectations for it, but the forks don&#39;t move up and down as I would&#39;ve liked. You can &#39;steer&#39; with the back wheels, which kinda gives it a weird unstable feel. The forks also drag when you move the lift around.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll build the two other models over the next few days - and perhaps update this review to reflect my opinion of those as well. So far, however, I&#39;m pleased with the set, even though the price per piece seems pretty steep at almost 9.5 cents a piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Edit: I liked the second model a lot too, but the third model was a bit disappointing. I don&#39;t expect all three builds of a 3-in-1 to be amazing, however, so I&#39;m still pleased with this set.</p>
