With the age range of 6-12, it is perfect for children and their&nbsp;grandparents. Hubby built the lizard, and I made the parrot with my set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Rainforest Animals set is outstanding in many ways. As a Creator 3 in 1 set, it offers detailed instructions for&nbsp;three different builds resembling a parrot, lizard and fish with extras of a frog and a fly. The box has fantastic photos of these builds. A surprising number of unusual parts in bright colors&nbsp;provides lots of flexibility for wings, feet, jaws, tails and anything else that needs to bend. And priced at 14.99US, it is a good value because it can lead to&nbsp;hours of fun if you choose not to&nbsp;speed build it;&nbsp;take your time and laugh a lot as you&nbsp;assemble the parts. We chose Plan B because it was the end of a long, hard day starting in another state&nbsp;at 3AM for hubby and I had raked about a zillion leaves in the yard after a full day of work and watching our newest family member. We made lots of wacko mistakes, but had even more&nbsp;fun creating&nbsp;our own weird&nbsp;critters out of the leftover&nbsp;parts....a snake and a couple of UFO&#39;s with quite buggy eyes! Kids can&nbsp;go utterly wild with these parts, so turn off their laptops, tablets and cell phones, and pass out the boxes. A perfect family/friends activity for the holidays.</p>

<p>It would be a blast to build these animals in other colors if we can find the parts. And there is no limit&nbsp;to the creepy critters that might crawl or fly into your rain forest party. Dig&nbsp;out the buggy invitations and invite your friends. We used to dress up for a Hawaiian Luau in dark February cold spells when I lived in Alaska because it broke up the frigid&nbsp;winter. Unpack&nbsp;your bright tropical vacation clothing and decorate your drinks with those crazy little&nbsp;pastel umbrellas. In the middle of winter it is&nbsp;Rain Forest Night at the Inn....let her rip!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Easy to access the box, good Instructions though I still think they need to define the colors the grey pieces better somehow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of neat pieces to add to your collection.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Guess the fly could count as a mini, pretty cute.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took a bit, but easy enough for the average person to put together</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great, they did a good job, love the round seeds you can put in the birds mouth and poop them out, hope I can say poop on this thing :)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good low priced set like most of the smaller Lego Creator series, highly recommended!</p>

<p>Box/Instructions - the set comes in a very&nbsp;colourful&nbsp;box with quite a few pictures of the 5 builds and inside the box there is 3&nbsp;seperate&nbsp;bags plus 3 different instruction books , one for each build each are pretty easy and simple to follow</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - the parts included are very&nbsp;colourful&nbsp;and fit together perfectly , my 2&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;pieces are the standard green arched 4644085 pieces</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build - very fun , relaxing and relaxing to do the only problems i had in building the set was placing the eyes in a certain position but other than that nobody should worry about the multi builds of the set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model - each model is sturdy , well balanced and for small models there is quite a bit of articulation and moveable parts/pieces take the parrot for instance you can position its wings in different directions , down by its side of spread out numerous ways fo flight mode one of the few times a lego model will be staying on my shelf intact</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion well i just cant express how much fun this set is the pieces are&nbsp;colourful&nbsp;the instructions are easy to follow and the articulation works perfectly for people who want to start collecting lego i strongly reccommend this set</p>

I&#39;ve been so impressed by the construction and detail of these 3 in 1 creator sets that I&#39;ve picked them up wherever I see them cheap.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is vibrant and depicts a rainforest scene, and everything in the main panel is buildable at once. The alternative models are equally as attractive. You get one book per model.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A striking, colorful assemblage of parts with curves and some very useful shapes, even if they are a bit garish. There are plenty of hinges and sockets to help the articulation of the models. There are no stickers, the eyes are printed on already! The eyes are a lovely addition to any collection: My son instantly transformed his crazy creations from faceless robots and spaceships to all manner of biological oddities with the eyes alone lending faces to the creations.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is an impressive lesson in minimalist Lego builds: The fly has so much character for so few parts. The frog has a couple og nice touches. But the Parrot is star of this show. He actually has a &#39;function&#39; so to speak (he has some food for a reason!) And he is very fun to build as you work out how he fits together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set builds into such a fun little collection. The Parrot has so much charm and the Frog has a multi-way posable mouth allowing impressive expression for such a simple build.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/4fGpesY.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 685px;"" /></p>

<p>Here&#39;s one of the alternative models, the Chameleon: His eyes rotate and his legs and tail are articulated.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/rybj4u0.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 835px;"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a must have for any Lego fan. The parts are useful but these creatures are just wonderful to behold. Some poor, unsung lego designer deserves major Kudos to the brilliance of this set.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve said it before, and having built 4 of these 3 in 1 creator sets now, I&#39;ll say it again: These are a solid return to the core ethos of Lego. The reason all the branded sets are so successful is because behind it all you have great design, thoughtful construction, and a range of parts that allow imaginations young and old to soar. Take it from an Adult Fan of all the big Technic builds: These brick kits are a joy in their own right and you deserve to own them!</p>

"Snail","2018-10-29T18:09:19.787Z","A fantastic creator set!","<p>This set is just a great get-into-Lego set of the modern age.</p>

<p>All of the buildable models Parrot and his sidekicks, Chameleon and Fish are well designed with convincing result for the given size. Favourite actually is the frog that looks great for that size, and even ca nmove his jaws and legs to some extent.</p>

<p>The set introduces some modern building techniques without being overwhelming, and the result still looks like &quot;Lego&quot;, not hiding away the underlying principles.</p>

<p>The parts are not specialised (good!) and still diverse (good!), and thanks to the theme in a big variety of colours.</p>

<p>Despite being a creator set that is not primarily intended for play, it offers a nice gimmic: the parrot can be fed with round tiles, and it can ... well ... poop them out again.</p>

<p>So to sum it all up: it&#39;s an attractive package to start with &ndash; and so convincing one won&#39;t stop in the creator range after having bought it. It somewhat makes appetite for more.</p>

<p>Even starting MOCing appears to be possible for a beginner with this set, being the right size not too overwhelming, demonstrating what can be accomplished with not too many parts.</p>
