"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-03-15T14:16:37.43Z","Fantastic Red Dragon","<p>As someone returning to LEGO after more than decade without having picked up anything new except the &lsquo;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/3845-1/Shave-A-Sheep"">Shave A Sheep&rsquo; </a>game (3845), two things struck me: the first was the incredible variety of colours now available and not just as decoration; the second was the amazing detail and flexibility in small models and pieces. This set provides some of the first, a lot of the second, and looks really great (I am a dragon fan), for an excellent price - &pound;12.99 from the LEGO Store.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box shows the dragon in flight on the front with small pictures of the snake and scorpion to the side under the 3-in-1 banner, the back has a picture of the 3 models together which is a nice overview, and there is a parts list on the side, which appears to be a feature of the Creator sets, and I think useful addition for those looking at the parts for building other models.</p>

<p>There are 2 instruction booklets, one for the Dragon, and the other for the Scorpion and the Snake.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Not surprisingly this set has a lot of red pieces, including a healthy dose of the beautiful and rich &lsquo;New Dark Red&rsquo; colour, a fantastic variety and quantity of articulation pieces (large ball and socket, small ball and socket, clip hinges and &lsquo;clicky&rsquo; hinges), as well as a good selection of teeth and claws pieces.</p>

<p>After building the Dragon, there is one small socket piece left over &ndash; this is needed for the scorpion!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>No minifigs in the set, which is fine as it&rsquo;s not what the set is about, but I do find myself thinking how best to mount one on his back as a dragon rider!</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The dragon is a straight forward build; the instructions list the pieces for each step (something you didn&rsquo;t get in the &lsquo;old days&rsquo;!) which makes them easy to follow, and the model is made up of no less than 20 &lsquo;mini-builds&rsquo; which all clip together to make the final model, which helps keep it uncomplicated.</p>

<p>The scorpion is a pretty easy build, a tiny bit more repetitive with the 6 legs, but a similar pattern of mini-builds keeps it simple and quick.</p>

<p>The snake is a very easy build, and while not terribly inspiring, the head is a great example of the amazing detail in a small model, and looks really good.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The dragon is a beautiful model, being highly articulated is very pose-able, and is also very &lsquo;swooshable&rsquo; as a flying creature. It is very stable standing on a flat surface and with the claws and tail balances very well on a not so flat surface.</p>

<p>The scorpion and snake are nice enough models, but apart from the snakes head, neither was particularly inspiring to me. This may well be because the dragon is such a beautiful model, I&rsquo;m not sure why you&rsquo;d want to take it apart to build either of the others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>Excellent. The Dragon is more than enough to make this set on its own. I would have no quibbles about buying more of these to create a (small) army of dragons. If this set was re-released sometime in the future in Blue (and Earth Blue), Green (and Earth Green) or other colours, I would pick those sets up (and in the meantime I will be looking out for the right parts in other colours to build them myself).</p>

"turtlestack","2016-02-06T20:14:34.933Z","My favorite dragon","<p>I have a few sets with dragons -&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70734-1/Master-Wu-Dragon"">70734:&nbsp;Master Wu Dragon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70738-1/Final-Flight-of-Destiny-s-Bounty"">70738:&nbsp;Final Flight of Destiny&#39;s Bounty</a>&nbsp;- but this is still my favorite dragon. Overall this guy just &quot;feels&quot; like a dragon - he&#39;s red, he has a dangerous looking tail, he&#39;s breathing fire, and he has nicely menacing claws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall what I like best about this dragon is the color;&nbsp;the reds look fantastic, but there is enough tan, grey, and black highlights (and those green eyes) to compliment the overall look of this set. He/she is well articulated (unlike some of the other&nbsp;Ninjago dragons), and while the talons tend to fall too easily out if you bump them&nbsp;and it can be tricky to keep in the same position when you pick it up to move it this is a well put together set.</p>

<p>The dragon is also easily modified to add a minifig rider and harness piece, and I even added a few pieces to his head to give&nbsp;him an even&nbsp;more menacing appearance. Add in that this is a 3in1 set with even more build possibilities and this is one of the nicest LEGO sets I&#39;ve ever owned. And since it&#39;s about $15 brand new at Target (US) right now this is a must have set.</p>

<p>Fun build, looks amazing, a little fragile, amazing value.</p>

"AyCarrumba","2016-08-20T09:28:10.01Z","Scary Red Creatures make a perfect 3 in 1 set!","<p>I feel that the 3 in 1 sets don&#39;t get much exposure so I thought I&#39;d write a review to sing their praises. I brought the &#39;Future Flyer 31034&#39; set home from a trip and it was a firm favorite with my son and it also served to remind me of &#39;back to basics&#39; Lego and what it can be when it&#39;s not themed, minifigged or part of a vast collection. These sets are just a great collection of parts, clever design, and a host of useful techniques sold at a reasonable price.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ll also state now that I&#39;ve decided to adopt a somewhat harsher marking policy. I&#39;m scoring my reviews from now on against Legos own high standards and saving 5&#39;s for the ones that are truly special or stand out.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
<br />
Perforated small box and two soft back instruction booklets. No Stickers! Everything here is done through the form of the parts themselves.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A multitude of hinges and ball joints let you create these highly articulated creatures. There are also lots of claws/horns in there (which are easy to lose!).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No Minifigs included but the dragon can be adapted to let a minifig ride him, he&#39;s about the right scale!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build on these models is what sets them apart. They&#39;re nicely paced and easy for kids to follow. My son (4.5) completed the dragon with supervision and some encouragement from me. We also built the scorpion together to help pass time on a long ferry ride. There are a host of nice techniques included to help develop your own building skills. The Dragons head in particular is very well done with a hinged jaw and although there are not many pieces the come together to make an impressive level of detail.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The three models are great to behold and very playable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The three creatures are very poseable because of the number of joints/hinges included. The Scorpion &#39;sags&#39; a bit on his legs over time but has moveable pincers and lots of character. The dragon stands well, spreads his wings and looks very angry! Plus of course if you do get bored with a creature, you can build one of the others any time.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I gave away my opinion at the start of this review: I&#39;m very glad Lego still put time and effort into sets like this which probably aren&#39;t huge sellers, but are definitely worthwhile. They add a very useful selection of parts and colors to any collection and they teach valuable building skills. They&#39;re also just plain fun allowing for imaginative play outside of franchised marketing universes. Both this and the Future Flyer set represent solid purchases and great value for money. I&#39;ll certainly be keeping an eye out for the 3 in 1 sets in future.</p>
