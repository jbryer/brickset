<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box precises that this is a 3 in 1 set : Next to the main building you can see two little pictures of the others cabins.<br />
Inside, there are three instruction booklets, one for each models.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As you can imagine seeing the box, there is a lot of dark blues slopes to build the roof. The wall are mostly made of yellow bricks, with white windows. Only two printed pieces, a green bill and a calculator.The Green surfboard appears to be exclusive to the set. The main colors are dark blue and yellow, not very realistic for a house, but it gives a funny look I like. Such a strong contrast among my Star Wars ships !</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are only two models, a kid and an adult. You can decide either wich one is will be the boy, as there is a cap and a girl hairstyle. The legs have nothing special, but the torsos are auite nice : one is a swimming suit with a zip on the back, the other is a white hoodie.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Apart from its serial number, this set has no name on the box. Probably because it&rsquo;s obvious : You won&rsquo;t build anything but a Beach Hut. The three instructions shows you how to create a little cabin on the beach. With small differences.</p>

<p>The first one can be split in two, depending on if you prefer to get a wide cabin or if you just want to have a blocky little house near your surf spot. I especially like the round windows. And the weird bird on the roof.</p>

<p>The second one appears to be a sauna and a pool. Once again, you can open the cabin to see what&rsquo;s inside. This building doesn&rsquo;t requiere to use all the parts.</p>

<p>The last one is quite weird : tall, with a large window on the second floor, except there is no stairs for the minifigs to get there&hellip; Bit it contains nice features as a rocky pathway in the garden and a bbq grill. One more time, a lot of spare parts.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The 50 % discount I had on this set was the main reason why I decided to buy it.Moreover, I mostly got Star Wars ships, so this was my first Creator set. I&rsquo;m disappointed by the few playability it offers, but the fun actually is in building the three models. Unfortunately, only two of these buildings are worth it (in my opinion), and the three are finally quite similar : a cabin and a garden / beach.&nbsp;<br />
At the end, this set is very useful to have a decent house for the City range, or if your into slopes. This not expensive set (even without a discount) &nbsp;benefits from a nice theme and a definitely cute look.<br />
