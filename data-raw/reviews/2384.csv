"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-20T23:03:16Z","GREAT set!"," this set is very cool with lots of neat parts.  With a little imaganation you can send this guy to mines on planet U for lots of adventures, it's very fun to play with.  There is one problem though, the cockpit keeps falling off the legs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Evilnurn","2007-03-19T23:13:41.467Z","Absolutely a great set","This set was my first Rock Raiders set back in '99 and inspired me to buy the whole collection. I loved the drill, first of all, and the leg idea worked great with the underground theme. With extra tools and controls, this set looks great due to detail. I especially liked detaching the top and making it &quot;fly&quot;.

The only drawback, in my opinion, is the amount of specialization of the pieces, very hard to create something of your own with these pieces.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"dragon_teenager","2009-04-23T23:27:51.84Z","One of the best Rock Raiders sets.","I own most of the Rock Raiders, and this set is among my favorites. It's a nice design and a cool idea, and comes with a great chrome drill. I can see some people don't like it, but personally I think the play factor outshines any design shortcoming. 

= PROS: =

- Walking legs work great

- Comes with a big chrome drill, one of only 2 sets to do so

- Great minifig 

- Comes with some accessories

- Cool printed parts

- Some nice details, like vents on the back and reverse lights on the legs

- Great play factor 

- Good display factor


= CONS: =

- I won't lie, the big drill is attached rather clumsily. 

- Some people have called the set juniorized. I think this word is tossed around far too arbitrarily, and I don't think this set deserves criticism for it. After all, the big parts do make for quite a nice look. 

- I kind of wish it came with Docs instead of Axel. He appears in way too many sets. 

- Needs a rock monster. 


Overall quite a good set. I was highly pleased. They're pretty cheap now, so if you're a RR fan pick it up for a very strong example of the awesome line! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ovid07","2007-08-31T16:27:08.77Z","Good Idea, Poor Set.","INTRO
This was a though task for Lego.  They had to justify futuristic mining vehicles at their best.

LOOKS
First off you really notice the chrome drill.  This was obviously a new piece and Lego did a pretty good job with it.  To support the chrome drill Lego added a cool back piece, jets, and teal colors!  The colors over all are good, and I love the printed yellow and black stripes, but the cockpit just doesn't cut it.  On the outside it's great, hoverer the inside's another story.  There's no seat and the controls are a kinda half hearted attempt.

SIZE
This is another case of &quot;juniorizing Legos&quot;.  Here Lego had the chance to make a huge drilling robot with movable legs, arms, and even a cockpit the size to fit two or three Rock Raiders.  But instead they give us this pathetic little $9.00 (USD) set.

FUNCTION
This is where the AT-ST's shuffle step came from (wahoo!).

OVERALL
This set just doesnt cut it.  If you want a little army of drillers get 5 of these.  However, if you want a cool monster did-o-bot look else where.  6/10.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-30T13:23:21.09Z","great peices","these peices are the best! like the drill, almost one of a kind the big long piece at the back. the legs move so you can kinda make it walk. the minifigure isnt very cool, but he fits in with the set well. the brown bar thing that goes over the guy (i dont no how to describe it) is cool looking and this set is a welcome addition to my collection =)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-23T17:30:03.577Z","Big, cool, and highly costomizable!","This set has plenty: working legs, tools, a cool minifigure, an awesome new (at the time it was a new part) drill, cockpit and windshield, great details, and easy to use parts (which is good for the creative builder).

The set is also faithful to the game, which adds the collector's touch to it. Also, the parts can be easily reused to build just about anything!

When I say customizable, I mean that you could easily stick a radar, laser, sword, or even a second drill on this thing, and it will still seem natural, especially when you add a Rock Raiders mining laser to it!

PS - For those who believe this is the origin of the &quot;shuffle step&quot; legs, you are sadly mistaken, for that design was first used in roboforce sets, which took THEIR design from old space sets which used multiple turntables (like those in the alienator) to add a walking step to it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-10-31T23:39:32.687Z","Small and agile...kinda","Not the biggest Rock Raiders, nor the best designed, but it's a lot of fun to play with. The legs move back and forth, which is the best feature of this set. Of course the drill is pretty cool too, not to mention it's half the length of the set...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"JSB23","2009-05-17T23:52:12.59Z","Drilling right to the core of the matter","This set is from one of my favorite themes of all time and though not the best is still quite good

Pros
Awesome drill
Actually walks
Decent amount of building 
Pretty cool pieces
Easy to customize

Cons
Only one figure?
Not much playability

I picked this set up for 10 dollars on E-bay so I definitely think it was worth it but I wouldn't pay more than $15 for it.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-25T11:47:06.973Z","LEGO Rock Raiders - Granite Grinder Review","The Granite Grinter sets is a very nice set and I got it (like most of my sets) as a present when it came out so I didn't really have to worry about the price. This set comes with three rare pieces which I've only seen in the LEGO Rock Raiders theme. The huge brown roll cage piece and the shiny silver driller are exclusive to this theme and this set for example. I like the design of this set and the colors which LEGO used to build this model.<br><br>This set comes with Axel who is a miner of the Rock Raiders crew. He's included in most of the sets of this theme which can be really annoying. If you have a look in the cockpit you can see two joysticks, a dashboard and a turquoise computer which is printed and which is the 3rd exclusive piece which we get in this set and in this theme.<br><br>The mechanism how the legs of the mech work is really ingenious and awsome. You also don't need to worry about stickers. It also has three ideas which you can build with the pieces of this set. You can find them on the back of the box.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2010-11-15T19:45:43.593Z","Granite Grinder Review","<p>A Rock Raiders set from the late 1990's... this was a predecessor to the Power Miners.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's appealed the most to me with this theme has been the color schemes and for the time, this was pretty daring on Lego's part to moving away from familiar Castle, Town, Pirates and Space themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The articulation of the legs for their shuffle walk isn't bad. The chrome drill while new at the time, fits on a bit clumsilly.</p>

<p>Comparing Rock Raiders to Power Miners, you can see how far Lego has come with designs and new brick pieces. </p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-05-03T20:41:43.517Z","Back to the grind.","<div>I have criticised Rock Raiders sets on previous occasions for being a cool idea but lacking in execution due to the presence of what I felt were overlarge, “junorised” pieces, something that was endemic to the Loader-Dozer (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=4950-1"">4950</a>) and elsewhere. Some LEGO historians [who?] say that this was part of a wider, unfortunate trend that affected many LEGO sets of the late-90s and early 2000s [citation needed], but being no expert myself, I can only comment on sets that I have had and owned.</div><div><br></div><div>The Granite Grinder, unsurprisingly, suffers from the same fate. Undoubtedly, this guy looks tough and has an impressive height, but all of this is made out of just 109 pieces. The bulk of this, er, bulk comes from an enormous “cockpit” and the brown mesh that goes over it, a huge and inexplicable grey arch that adorns the back, and understandably large pair of feet for balance, and the sweet chrome drill that is really the highlight of this set. Most of the rest of the piececount goes towards mirror-image constructs of the feet and legs of the Grinder, which are functional enough but not terribly exciting on their own.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I guess, though, that I am able to look past the usual faults that I associate with the Rock Raiders for two reasons. The first is that drill, which is just cool. I mean, come on - it’s a giant LEGO giga drill, with which you can pierce the LEGO heavens. The second is that the whole Battletech-ish design, which is a novelty even today. Oh sure, Bionicle and Hero Factory and so forth have since generated more LEGO mechs than anyone could care for (or maybe not, since people keep buying them), but mechs that Minifigs can pilot are still a relative scarcity. Of course, Granite Grinder can’t hold a candle to Lex Luthor’s Power Suit (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6862-2"">6862</a>) in terms of complexity, which is an unfair comparison given the elapsed years between them.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So, I would say that Granite Grinder stands out as a positive example that came out of the Rock Raiders franchise. Whether or not it’s good enough to justify the collection of the entire subtheme is up to you. As far as this set stands on its own merits, though, I would say that it’s pretty good and offers a lot of potential in terms of reworking it for your own creations (I’ve since re-done it and enlisted it as part of my Fantasy Era Dwarven army).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>One final addendum: the Minifig in Granite Grinder is exactly the same as he who is found in Loader-Dozer, though this set is obviously and conspicuously lacking in a Rock Monster of its own. I would say get this set and pick up a monster either through BrickLink or through another set.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
