You can't go wrong.","<p>This was another one of those sets that wound up on store shelves near me long after most Chima sets were retired. Since it was on clearance, it was only a matter of time before I would pick it up, and today I did just that.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>No issues with the box, it&#39;s the expected size, and&nbsp;shows everything it could reasonably&nbsp;show&nbsp;about the final product. The set has two manuals so that&nbsp;one person can work on the figures and snow mobile, while a second person works on the main construction. Very clear directions&nbsp;as usual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A good mix of colors and rare pieces. Tons of technic parts.&nbsp;The parts that stood out to me in particular were this set of&nbsp;very large fire&nbsp;pieces which end up the vehicle&#39;s back side. I hadn&#39;t ever seen these pieces before, despite owning a number of other fire-themed sets. Of course, also notable is that you&nbsp;get those three&nbsp;large wheels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>EDIT: I just realized that those fire pieces in question appear in much larger numbers in the $20 set Flinx&#39;s&nbsp;Ultimate Phoenix, in case you want a lot of them.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All three minifigures are relatively rare. Bladvic&nbsp;the bear&nbsp;doesn&#39;t appear in any other sets. Iceklaw&nbsp;the ice bear&nbsp;only appears in this set and a small&nbsp;polybag. Vornon&nbsp;the vulture only has three sets, all of which came towards the second half of Chima&#39;s life, and he doesn&#39;t appear in any cheap sets. It&#39;s a great mix of seldom-seen figures for a set at this price point. It&#39;s also a breath of fresh air that Iceklaw has a holder for his gun on his back. I&#39;m always afraid I&#39;m going to lose the weapons that go with each figure if they get played with. Bladvic is also given a place to put his accessories once the build is complete.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You get a small &quot;bag 1&quot; to make the figures and the small snow vehicle, and then it&#39;s on to the Rumble Bear, which takes 3 bags. As this is a transforming vehicle, it has a very large amount of technic elements in its mid-section. This is one thing I have always enjoyed about Chima vehicles is seeing how all the moving parts are designed. For me, these vehicles are always fun to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The first thing most people probably noticed when looking at the box is the three huge wheels that make up the Rumble Bear&#39;s chest when it&#39;s standing - it&#39;s a little odd looking. However,&nbsp;they really did a good job with this concept, and I don&#39;t think much could have been done to cover the wheels without making the transformation overly complicated.&nbsp;Even to balance it on only three wheels while it&#39;s driving took a little bit of thought on the designer&#39;s part, because this is a huge bear.</p>

<p>When you finish your construction, the Rumble Bear will be in driving mode, and you realize that having a giant&nbsp;bear on wheels&nbsp;in a Superman pose driving towards you would be pretty terrifying.</p>

<p>I should also mention that the head moves, the mouth can be opened, and the hands are posable with short articulating fingers.</p>

<p>All in all it&#39;s a pretty unique vehicle that mostly looks really good, and all the technic pieces are&nbsp;well covered up. If you don&#39;t like the wheels on the chest, there&#39;s no reason you can&#39;t display it in driving mode.</p>

<p>I almost forgot to mention the snow mobile, but it&#39;s such a tiny vehicle. My preferred way to pose this set will be to have Iceklaw&nbsp;trying to escape the bear on wheels&nbsp;that&#39;s 10x the size of his vehicle. It&#39;s a funny scene.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Another unique Chima set that looks cool, and has a variety of ways it can be played with. Especially given the rare&nbsp;minifigures in this set,&nbsp;it&#39;s hard to advise any Chima&nbsp;fans not to pick this up.</p>
