"TheBigBB","2016-04-15T07:58:15.24Z","A proper sendoff for the Chima theme.","<p>Although I don&#39;t watch the show, I&#39;ve gathered that Laval, Cragger, and Eris are essentially the main characters of the Chima theme, especially since they are the playable characters in Lego Dimensions. As such, it was&nbsp;fitting to see Laval and Cragger&nbsp;appear once again in this large set&nbsp;to see the theme off. (Eris appears in&nbsp;the similarly impressive&nbsp;Tiger&#39;s Mobile Command.)&nbsp;Another massive crocodile tribe vehicle was especially welcome&nbsp;after 2014 only had a couple of small sets for the crocs. Since we already&nbsp;have awesome Crocodile Tribe&nbsp;boats and land vehicles,&nbsp;it was only fitting to give them a flying ship.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s&nbsp;a large box that shows you all you could want to know about the set and its various functions. The instruction book is one huge book&nbsp;like what you might see with a modular set. I thought it was strange that there weren&#39;t two books&nbsp;because this would be an excellent set for two people to work on. That&#39;s the only negative thing I can say here. On the plus side, having it all in one thick book makes the book less likely to get bent like most instruction manuals.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Reds, greens, and yellows of varying hues. Lots of technic, particularly long racks with up to 15 holes. Quite a few rare large&nbsp;parts like the blades of the copter and the feet.&nbsp;The overall&nbsp;variety is great&nbsp;since Laval&#39;s and Cragger&#39;s vehicles are completely different types and color schemes, and it&#39;s not like Laval&#39;s vehicle is tiny. Stickers aside, this is another set where you just could not get&nbsp;the pieces needed to build it without a superhuman effort on Bricklink, so the parts potentially&nbsp;make the set worth owning, no doubt!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I love Chima minifigures,&nbsp;so rather than gush about my Chima obsession,&nbsp;I will talk about the rarity of the figures for people who just want to buy a few sets.</p>

<p>The highlight is Saraw the ice bear, who doesn&#39;t appear anywhere else, although he isn&#39;t that unique looking. Icepaw&nbsp;is also rare,&nbsp;only appearing&nbsp;in this set and Icebite&#39;s Claw Driller.</p>

<p>Crominus&nbsp;might be a croc you don&#39;t have if you never got the Cragger&nbsp;Command Ship or Swamp Hideout, both from 2013. He is especially&nbsp;worth getting for his distinctive golden headpiece. This is also the only version of him in his fire outfit.&nbsp;Those other&nbsp;sets with him&nbsp;are both in the $100 range these days, so this&nbsp;might actually be the best place to pick Crominus up in 2016, especially since at the time I&#39;m writing this, Crominus&#39; Rescue is on clearance at most stores.</p>

<p>The other three figures are easy to obtain in much cheaper sets. They&#39;re nice figures, but not a&nbsp;reason to get this particular set over another.</p>

<p>Overall, Lego Group did a good job of mixing iconic Chima characters with&nbsp;rarely seen ones.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There is no&nbsp;construction other than the two vehicles, which I am okay with. I will just stick the ice figures on another ice set rather than have some&nbsp;tiny pathetic bad guy vehicle that would get destroyed in seconds.</p>

<p>You start with&nbsp;three minifigs and Laval&#39;s lion vehicle on bags 1 and 2.&nbsp;Laval&#39;s vehicle begins&nbsp;by mostly using standard Lego bricks&nbsp;to form the head of the lion, and then technic elements to attach the wheels, treads, and the ball joint that hooks it onto the croc copter. It&#39;s an unremarkable build, but&nbsp;plenty of fun.&nbsp;I had no problems with it.</p>

<p>Bags 3-6 have&nbsp;the other three figures, and the main croc vehicle. You will probably never have a bag involving more technic peg/axle&nbsp;insertion than bag 3. There are over 50 of them to insert!&nbsp;This bag also features SIX 15-hole technic racks as well as four 7-hole racks, with a few other smaller racks. For me, this is great because the build did something I wasn&#39;t expecting. I knew there would be&nbsp;some technic stuff to attach the legs and head to, but&nbsp;I got more technic than ever in my wildest dreams. Much love to the designer of the set for an interesting build. Bag 4 isn&#39;t much lighter on the technic elements, either.&nbsp;I don&#39;t look forward to the day when my son wants to take this apart and rebuild it. Removing all this stuff will be more daunting than building it.</p>

<p>I was pleased that the four legs were pretty easy to build, too, as that always seems like it&#39;ll be tedious on legged vehicles. It took a lot less time to build all 4 legs than, say, making the copter part.</p>

<p>Anyway, if you like massive amounts of&nbsp;technic, this set will be a lot of fun. If you just like putting Lego bricks together, well, there&#39;s plenty of that, too, but perhaps consider another set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is&nbsp;a masterpiece. All those hundreds of technic rack holes, and somehow they aren&#39;t that&nbsp;noticable&nbsp;at a glance from most angles. It is as long as Maula&#39;s Ice&nbsp;Mammoth Stomper or the Cragger Command Ship, and the propeller wingspan makes this take up as much space lengthwise&nbsp;as widthwise.</p>

<p>The croc head and teeth are particularly fierce looking this time. There are tons of teeth in there, and the instructions have you put them facing all different ways. Lego designers have&nbsp;had a lot of fun making these croc mouths look awesome through the years. The mouth on both vehicles can open and close, as usual.</p>

<p>The legs are in a fixed position, but that&#39;s fine. You&#39;re going to be flying this if you play with it, not really simulating walking. The feet do dangle, but always provide firm support when it&#39;s landed. The main moving part is the propellers, which move in unison and even can produce a helicopter noise by having a gear tapping against a rugged surface.</p>

<p>Cragger and Laval both fit in their vehicles with their weapons AND their fire wings. The designers were smart enough to leave a gap in the back of Cragger&#39;s cockpit enclosure. In some other sets like Eris&#39; Eagle Interceptor, you had to remove her wings to make her fit. That set is good, but it was one downside that&#39;s not present here.</p>

<p>The mechanism to attach Laval&#39;s vehicle operates through the tension provided by an elastic band, and once you get used to it, you can easily pick up and drop the vehicle without looking under. Once it&#39;s picked up, there&#39;s no chance it&#39;ll fall off until you want it to. You can even have Laval&#39;s vehicle&nbsp;attached to the bottom while the croc&nbsp;copter&nbsp;is landed with its feet flat on the ground.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a masterpiece that sends off the theme on a high note. It&#39;s really too bad that there wasn&#39;t a lot of excitement for this as people were probably more eager to check out the new Nexo Knights theme than buy another Chima set, but this set is absolutely worth adding to your collection if you like Chima. Even with the multitudes of vehicles out there, Crominus&#39; Rescue still managed to fill a niche that wasn&#39;t covered. The only way I would discourage anyone from buying this set is if they just hated building with technic. Otherwise, I recommend it to everyone but the staunchest Chima haters.</p>

"exorallan31","2022-09-15T15:06:54.167Z","wow.","<p>For the figures we have craggier, crominus, Laval, icepaw, saraw and strainor. these are all nice figures with fine weapons. love the wings for craggier and laval.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Putting this set together was.. not my favourite expensive with tons of technic stuff that i don&#39;t like. otherwise it was enjoyable...</p>

<p>For the parts we have some rotors, feet, blades, gears and teeth. tons of useful stuff.</p>

<p>For the models we have a small bit of ice, laval&#39;s lion vehicle and the main Helicroctor.</p>

<p>For the bit of ice... this is literally just 2 parts. to hold king crominus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lion vehicle looks good i think with a nicely shaped lion head, moveable mouth, And some disc shooters. Laval can sit in it with his sword and wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Main helicroctor build is a masterpiece. Big wings with fire elements, massive legs, fancy cockpit with a moveable mouth where you can hold figures in it.&nbsp; And it has some interesting play functions. It has a very simple ratcheted mechanism to spin the blades that works pretty well, but hurts my fingers, may just be a me issue however. You have some flick missiles too, which are not all that exiting. But the main &#39;&#39;Chi fire mode&#39;&#39; function is combining it with laval&#39;s vehicle. just stays in a place because of the ball, and it will only fall when you want to.</p>

<p>Speaking of that, there&#39;s a mechanism to drop it that works pretty well. Tons of fun play to be had here.</p>

<p>So overall, it&#39;s a masterpiece. wowowowowow. nothing wrong here except for my fingers hurting when using the ratcheted mechanism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PPP Isn&#39;t perfect. it&#39;s just fine. there is a lot of play value here however</p>
