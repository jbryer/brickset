"Ernst","2015-01-22T16:46:03.08Z","Cool for kids, great for Castle moc's.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : This Chima battle pack&nbsp;is a great set for kids who love the Chima theme and also for AFOL&#39;s who like to built Castle MOC&#39;s. It has a good working shooting device, lovely mini figures and has great parts for MOC&#39;s with several Bright Light Orange parts. The price &euro; 9,99 is very good so in reach for everybody.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong> : the built is of course not the most challenging one, 2 small side walls and a catapult. And of course the assembling of the 3 mini figures and the Lion banner.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : Several Bright Light Orange slopes which&nbsp;is still a&nbsp;rare color, mostly found in Chima sets. The 3 great looking Lion mini figures can be simply moderated to Castle figures, great weapons, several gold parts and the new&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=14769pb021"">red flamed round tiles</a>. Also&nbsp;the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=bb620pb01"">Lion banner</a> which you can also&nbsp;use as a Castle accessorie.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks</strong> : This set has all the ingredients a playing set needs, 3 mini figures with a load of weapons and great shooting device. Why not 5 here ? Simple reason, there is no enemy so you need to buy another set for maximum playing fun.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : Looking at the retail price being &euro; 9,99 and the&nbsp;content the 5 bricks : make a simple calculation if the you want to buy the parts. Only the 3 mini figures bought seperatly&nbsp;will cost you more. So whether you are an AFOL or you have a kid who loves Lego I can only advise you to BUY it.&nbsp;</p>

However is this a set worthy of picking up? Read on and find out.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is a nice little design with the Fire vs. Ice colours predominant. The box looks great, I appreciate the showing of the tribe flag on the side. And the back has a nice image of, combine this set with the 70223 set to make a nifty battle scene.</p>

<p>The instructions are really impressive, despite being a very small set, the instructions include all of the steps for the build, which is simple and straightforward, and includes a minifigure checklist in the very back. Something most small sets in other Themes skip or ignore. Overall great design and works brilliantly.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>You have two generic army builders in this set and one named character from the Fire Tribe, who is now part of the Lion Tribe.</p>

<p>Li&rsquo;Ella: A lioness warrior raised by members of the Fire Tribe, this version of Li&rsquo;Ella includes a double-sided torso with a nice female torso print, leg printing, a double-sided facial print. A nice new lioness headpiece with limited printing for the muzzle. She&rsquo;s wearing a standard Chi Armour with fire chi power stud, and her weapon is a spear attached to a Lightsaber handle. She also gets a Fire Chi crystal.</p>

<p>Lion Tribe Warrior: This generic looking warrior is a male lion, he includes standard double-sided torso printing, leg printing, a double-sided facial print and the Lion headpiece in brown with a light tan print around the eyes and for the muzzle.</p>

<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have any armour, but he does include a round shield and a strange double-bladed dagger weapon using the Lightsaber hilt and two white tooth pieces for the blades. All-in-all a great army builder.</p>

<p>Lion Tribe Warrior: Another lioness from this battle pack, she&rsquo;s using the same torso as Li&rsquo;Ella as far as printing is concerned, but has different printing on her legs and her double-sided face. Her headpiece has more printing as well, aside from the muzzle there&rsquo;s metal armour of some kind on the sides of her face, stopping just before the top of the head.</p>

<p>Her accessory is a stud-launcher with a large white tooth attached to the back of it. It&rsquo;s a pretty interesting accessory choice, since most Chima weapons have been swords and sorcery based stuff, seeing something that shoots is a bit curious.</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>For this set we&rsquo;ll streamline everything, mostly because the set doesn&rsquo;t have much of a build to it. The model in this set is a small battle defense station, using three separate models to create the likeness of a lion tribe weapons emplacement and two protective barriers.</p>

<p>The build is quick and easy, and shares the thematic design of looking like a lion&rsquo;s face/muzzle with front paws. A new disc launcher piece is introduced this year that shoots your standard circle tile pieces. (Printed here with flame details.) Aside from that new piece, nothing rare in this set, with one notable exception.</p>

<p>The Lion Tribe standard. A nice soft plastic flag adorned with the Lion Tribe symbols, a big lion head in the centre with two symbols on either side. Coloured in light and dark blue, this flag is an excellent little addition to your Chima collection.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say this little set is worth picking up. For army builder fans you get some great minifigures to bulk up your tribes, and as a bonus two of them are female characters, a rare site indeed for Legends of Chima.</p>

<p>The models in the set are small, not much to look at without a larger set to display them with, but still serves as a decent little fun defensive battle post for your lion tribe troops to guard against the approaching Ice Tribes. Strongly recommend this set.</p>
