INTRO
This is another set from the so-so rock raider line-up.  Along with #4980 (tunnel transport) it's one of the only good sets.

LOOKS
This set obviously looks well enough like a digger, however how Lego used the big piece at the bottom I don't like much.  I mean come on Lego!, this is obviously a new mold and will probably never be used again (or in any of my Mocs for that matter)!  If you want to take a close look at this piece go to a part scan on PICSL, and prepare to be amazed.

SIZE IN RELATIONS WITH COPPERATE MARKETING.
This is a small yet beautiful set.

FEATURES
The main drawing point for this set is the movible bucket.  Lego achivees this by ataching a chain pice to the bucket, and the handle thingy on the back.  This works fine , however I would rather see some technic pices (fuss, fuss).

OVERALL      
Despite a few draw backs this set is worth $10.00-$15.00 today on ebay or bricklink.  Why it so good get two. :)

It's got a powerful, industrial, gritty look to it and comes with a great minifig. However, it is probably the most juniorized of the theme and the bucket lift mechanism isn't the greatest. 

= PROS = 

- Solid construction. This set is built like a rock. No pun intended.

- Some good pieces- cool accessories and a rare brown chain. 

- Great minifig.

- Includes rare Rock Monster. This one of the two sets this figure appeared in. The other was the big Rock Raiders HQ, which was obviously a far more expensive method of obtaining the monster.

- Pretty fun to play with. 

- Good display.

 
= CONS = 

- Rather juniorized. 

- The bucket lift gimmick isn't really the greatest, as the locks tend to fall off. 

- Some unslightly gaps plague the model, however it's still very solidly built. 

- I wish it had included somebody besides Axel, since he appeared in many other sets. 


All in all a decent set, definitely for you if you like Rock Raiders and don't mind large pieces. It's pretty cheap on Ebay, too. However, if you want a really good example of Rock Raiders, the Tunnel Transport is by far the best set in the theme and I would recommend that over this. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-01-16T06:49:45.373Z","Digging Made Easy!","This set is one of my favourite sets. It is from he short lived Rock Raiders series that started in 1999 and died out at the turn of the millennium, which is a shame as it had some great models and was made into an excellent computer game. 

The Loader-Dozer is one of the four larger vehicles and has a lot of great features. The shape of the chassis was unique to the series only being used in this set and the Chrome Crusher back in the day and more recently in 05 in the XXL Mobile Crane but in a different colour. 

The bucket on the dozer is pretty big and can hold a few blocks. The best part of this is the bucket is on a chain attached to a leaver at the back to vary the hight and angle of the bucket. The lever can be locked into place to hold the bucket up when it has a big load.

The other great things about the model are the wheels and the cockpit. The wheels are quite large and very able to handle any terrain. The cockpit has has a full cage to protect him and is on hinges for easy playability. The vehicle is controlled by computer system, which makes it more futuristic. The vehicle is also equiped with moveable headlights and tools like a pipe wrench, spanner and dynamite.

The mini-fig is named Alex. He is the main driver in the rock raider series. He is wearing grey pants, black shirt with overalls, brown helmet and  neon yellow face shield. His face is half smile half smirk with orange hair and black sideburns.

The other two things that come with this set and really up the playability are the rock monster, which is one solid piece but his arm moves a full 360 degrees and a boulder, which splits in half to reveal a neon green energy crystal. The first releases came with a comic book, which I have one and is really neat.

Overall this is a brilliant model that I can find no fault with, other than it's not still in stores. The playability is quite high and the aesthetics are really high in my book. I feel this model is a 9/10 as it is really good but not quite perfect. I would recommend this model to anyone who likes space, fantisy, adventure or just a nice model o add to your collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The cockpit is raised higher the vehicle, giving it an &quot;out of harm's way&quot; feel, especially with that Rock Monster (which is surprisingly rare!). The vehicle has a large base with large wheels, making it good for harsh terrain, plus the base adds playability since it serves good for any vehicle, especially large ones!

I really missed that rock in the LEGO Power Miners theme. Also the rock monster is very cool. The whole monster is just one piece. The legs and the head don't move but the arm does.

"Harmonious_Building","2012-03-03T15:11:40.04Z","Low-down loader.","<div>The Rock Raiders came out towards the end of my age-appropriate enthusiasm for LEGO (does such a concept exist?), and, even now, I feel largely ambivalent towards the Rock Raiders line as a whole. I think I warmed up to it slightly in later years (as evidenced by the fact that I have a surprising number of sets from the theme; honestly I don’t even remember how/why I got them all - perhaps I was intoxicated on BrickLink one night or something - but, on the whole, the Rock Raiders designs just seemed to be somewhat lacking in terms of overall coherence and aesthetic.</div><div><br></div><div>That isn’t to say that the concept isn’t inherent cool. Although <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Earth"">Hollow-Earth Theory</a> has taken a blow in recent years thanks to David Icke, there is something fascinating about a (post apocalyptic?) culture existing beneath the surface of the planet. Sure, they’re ostensibly digging for crystals or something like that, but who cares? You have massive, manly machines that exude power and plough through stuff.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>That being said, it doesn’t seem as though Loader-Dozer should have any major failings. It’s an enormous sci-fi-ish bulldozer that comes with huge wheels and a simple mechanism for operating the bulldozer piece in the front. A polyhedronic (probably not a word, but I don’t care) cockpit with a matching cover (lacking in a certain practical usefulness against overhead rubble that may fall on top of the machine) provides ample room for the sole Minifig to operate his bulldozer, and a handful of specialised tools allow him to get any small jobs done. And that Rock Monster! Is there anyone who doesn’t love it? (I no longer have my Rock Raiders sets on display, but my Rock Monsters have found a happy home in antagonising my Fantasy Era Dwarves.)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But perhaps it’s precisely the brutishness of the Loader-Dozer that ultimately contributes to its lack of aesthetic. A low piececount is a direct result of enormous, highly-specialised pieces, many of which are listed in the preceding paragraph. All of this gives the set a rather “juniorised” feel, which is not really a word that one wants to associate with a set about manly men drilling into the core of the Earth. Other than the Rock Monster, it’s a little hard to find things to love about this set.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I suppose that credit should be given to LEGO for attempting to break into a new non-space sci-fi subgenre a la <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Aquazone"">Aquazone</a>, but Rock Raiders doesn’t quite seem to make the mark, and Loader-Dozer unfortunately exemplifies that, in my opinion. In fact, I was sort of shocked the discover, ten years later, that the Rock Raiders found themselves revived in the form of the Power Miners, which are even weirder.

Both the box and instructions have pictures of alternate models that can be built with the set&rsquo;s pieces, to get your creativity started. One is a transport hovercraft, another is a digger/hovercraft vehicle, and the third (only on the box), is a wheeled vehicle with some sort of chomping/crushing mouth.&nbsp;Man, I miss the days when Lego used to encourage creativity this way!&nbsp;The set also included a mini comic book with a hilarious story in it (all of the 1999 Rock Raiders sets did; each one had a different story).</span></span></span></span></p>

This set contains some of the rarest and most useful pieces in my collection. The big bucket is my favorite part, and is featured in many Technic sets. Sometimes, when building MOC&rsquo;s, I would make a huge grabber claw out of two of them. The chassis is one huge piece, which makes the build relatively simple but nonetheless, is very useful. I have used it in many creations, and I also have the 4970 Chrome Crusher, so I have 2 of these chassis pieces! Many times, I have combined the two to make giant 8-wheeled vehicles. The monstrous tires are cool, and the cockpit is made of two pieces: the bottom half and the brown cage, which are two very rare pieces. I have used the bottom piece on makeshift boat hull creations before. There are also lots of regular bricks, plates, and tiles in a variety of colors, some of which are rare. Notable examples include the turquoise 1x2 grill tiles and the sloped brick. There are also several transparent neon-yellow/green pieces, which I always thought were cool!

You move it up and down with a handle at the back which is hooked to a brown chain which pulls the bucket up and down. The bucket can hold 2 boulders or a few Lego bricks. It can be locked into place when carrying loads, thanks to a simple but ingenious locking mechanism. The monstrous tires roll very smoothly. It looks as if it could drive over very rough terrain with those tires. The roll cage over the cockpit opens so you can put a mini-figure operator inside, and close it to protect the operator from falling rocks or rollovers. There are two headlights to illuminate the underground caverns. Inside there is a seat and computers to control it.
