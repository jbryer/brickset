You can help Emma speed to the rescue in this very small ambulance which is open top for easy play access.&nbsp;This set is intended to be a add-on to the Vet Clinic from the LEGO Friends Vet subtheme from the 2015 release.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BOX / INSRUCTIONS:</strong></p>

<p>The box is a standard size for a $10/&pound;10 set however with only 89 pieces some might suggest that it is borderline polybag territory and I would have to agree. The instructions are easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PARTS:</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s surprising when built that this set actually has 89 pieces as it looks a lot smaller than what you would expect 89 pieces to be. The parts are&nbsp;not terribly unique. The mold used for the Hedgehog does look different from the Polybag versions and Magazine version however I am yet to obtain those sets to be sure.</p>

<p>Other pieces include, the Milk/Water bottle, 1 x 2 printed Vet Ambulance piece (Magenta Cross), Medium Azure Brick Bow Arch and Medium Azure Wheel Arch.</p>

<p><strong>MIINIDOLLS:</strong></p>

<p>This comes with Emma in her Vet outfit. The torso comes in the Vet Clinic on Mia&#39;s minidoll but no other sets at this stage. The Sand Green skirt comes in a number of other sets from the Jungle Rescue range but also the mini golf polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BUILD:</strong></p>

<p>The build only took around 5 mins and there is not much to it, the instructions are easy to follow and with only 89 pieces you are not endlessly looking for pieces. I do not feel the building experience is what you are buying this set for, it is a simple additional set to go with the Vet Clinic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FINAL MODEL</strong>:</p>

<p>The final model for me looks good and the colours are in keeping with LEGO Friends sets, the only reservation I have is the size, I feel the ambulance could have been a little bigger, perhaps the size of one of the LEGO Friends cars. It doesn&#39;t disappoint overall but also the cost is quite high for the piece count.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>Don&#39;t buy it unless you have the Vet Clinic, the set by itself does not offer much but as an additional item with the Vet Clinic I think it is worth purchasing this set. I personally picked this up over half price off in a local Tesco Supermarket in the UK but had it been full price I would not have purchased it.&nbsp;</p>
