<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing notable.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A few nice inclusions:<br />
<br />
- <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6102882"">feeding bottle</a></p>

<p>- <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6096094"">basket</a></p>

<p>- <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4656783"">dark tan 1x2 bricks</a></p>

<p>- <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4119478"">carrot!</a></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Though there aren&#39;t any actual minifigs, the rabbits are without a doubt adorable.&nbsp; The two smaller bunnies seem more suited to regular minifgure scale, so they should work better than the larger one in a forest scene for MOCs.&nbsp; Strangely, the small ones still have the little hole on their heads to accommodate a bow, but the bow is almost as big as they are, so it looks ridiculous.&nbsp; I wonder if there are other accessories that might work better, though I prefer them unadorned anyway.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Rudimentary.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Bright and cheery, but unremarkable.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The build isn&#39;t anything special, but the bunnies make it worth the buy (the smaller ones in particular).&nbsp; I rejoice whenever my wife opts to buy LEGO of her own volition, so I consider it money well-spent.</p>

"BrickTin","2015-08-31T23:17:40.91Z","Tiny cute set","<p><img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/small/41087-1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Little set with rare pieces.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very small but representative. The intructions are quite small, just one sheet of paper.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with some great useful parts as well some exclusive ones - baby bunies.</p>

<p>The baby bunies can be used as minifigure sized animals. A carrot is a rarer piece and also two mason bricks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has&#39;t got any minidolls/minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building of this&nbsp;set is simple but still&nbsp;very enjoyable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model doesn&#39;t really look so good on the shelf. The set has a better value for the pieces.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a must for bunny lovers and Friends sets buyers. Comes with some rare pieces and threee&nbsp;animals (rabbits).</p>
