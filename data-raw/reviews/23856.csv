"The_Mad_Vulcan","2016-01-22T22:01:51.01Z","The Perfect Set for My Daughter","<p>I picked this set up because it was cheap and included a Friends character, a car, and a gas pump, knowing that my daughter would like it. While all of those are excellent, what kicks this set over the top is the tool set. My daughter just loves putting gas and oil into her car, having her friends characters wash and fix it - and all this for $15.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box does show all that comes with the set, but I wasn&#39;t paying much attention to that. I just saw mini-doll + car and bought it. The build took quite a long time as it is assembled with quite a lot of small parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots and lots of small parts. The best are all the parts in the metallic grey color. Including, a set of 9 different tools and a tool box. Because of the number of small parts, it came with a lot of extra parts as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is Mia, one of the main characters from the show, wearing her standard outfit. I&#39;d bet that other people already have this figure, but we did not.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty complicated for such a small set, due to so many small parts. There are no printed pieces, aside from the mini-doll. But the&nbsp;stickers weren&#39;t at all difficult to apply.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The car is very nice and it is the main focus, so that is what matters. I wish the gas pump and car washing station were connected and on a larger plate, to make them more sturdy. But that would likely result in a more expensive set and they could easily be place on a road base plate to make a good play scene.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Amazing! There is tons of play value in this tiny and inexpensive set. The car is the main focus and is a sturdy and good looking build with an opening trunk, for storing tools or supplies, and seating for two mini-dolls. I probably would have payed $15 for the tools alone, and I bought this not even realizing that they were there.&nbsp;</p>
