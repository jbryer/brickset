<p>I wanted to check out the parts ,but there was not a parts list available as of the purchase date of 12/22/2014 ... so I opened her up to check the contents...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The box is same basic size of all the second tier ($10.00) sets. The instructions come folded, as most sets in this price range do.</p>

<p>The instructions lead the builder to start as most LEGO sets do, figure first. Then the scooter, next the various parts of the open air pizzeria.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice parts count of just shy of ninety&nbsp;pieces. Nice red scooter that Santa has already commandeered for package delivery around the ol&#39; elf workshop.</p>

<p>The pizzeria bits were simple to build. but did not last too long , as such. It has already been rebuilt into a nice brick hearth fireplace to keep the cold out of the two walled elf toy&nbsp;workshop ...</p>

<p>The elves ate the three pizzas before their boss Santa even thought about the side effects of &quot;borrowing&quot; Stephanie&#39;s scooter. Now HE&#39;S on the naughty list!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minidoll&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Stephanie did not get assembled , as my granddaughter likes to do that part of the builds ...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nicely done small set . Built in less&nbsp;than&nbsp;30 minutes ( by a sleep deprived&nbsp;adult, &nbsp;at midnight).</p>

<p>I will update the build time when she&nbsp;builds her own copy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks very nice together,&nbsp;as a play set. This will no doubt be a hit with Friends fans (not the TV series, with awful Joey in it).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend at least buying two of these sets,</p>

<p>&#39;cause your daughters and granddaughters are not going to understand why the TMNT&nbsp;can&#39;t eat their&nbsp;own pizza and leave Heartlake&nbsp;City and Stephanie&#39;s &nbsp;Pizzeria alone.</p>

<p>Seriously , this is a nice builder and sweet parts set!</p>

<p>Additional info... Now have bought four more ... for me!</p>

<p>Great parts set!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-31T23:09:43.62Z","Stephanie Continues to Impress.","<p><strong>Set #41092 Stephanie&rsquo;s Pizzeria:</strong> Stephanie loves baking and making great food, so here she has her own outdoor pizzeria to try out new taste sensations for all her friends, and make some extra money on the side when she&rsquo;s not busy helping out the wild life of Heartlake City or her new friend Pop Star Livi.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: It&rsquo;s your standard 12.99$ LEGO Friends box, showing all the fun of the set on the front and the numerous play options on the back, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with LEGO Friends.</p>

<p>Instructions: These instructions are your standard type for sets of this size, with about twenty pages, the steps to follow aren&rsquo;t tricky at all and the back includes a set checklist for this wave and a shot of Heartlake City, which has become the norm for LEGO Friends.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The parts in this set are mostly fairly standard, the biggest draw here would be the two 1x4 mason breaks, the red bowl/half balloon piece and the two flat pink tiles with studs on the bottom. Nothing much else for unique parts here.</p>

<p>Minidoll</p>

<p>Stephanie: Wearing the new shorts for her lower legs in pink, Stephanie looks ready to deliver pizzas and have fun doing it. Her white top is printed with a clutter of symbols, stars and planets, it&rsquo;s a pretty interesting design though I&rsquo;m not sure if its brand new or has been used before. She also comes with a helmet piece to protect her head while riding in the scooter, again I am not a fan of this helmet because it doesn&rsquo;t include any sculpted hair elements making any female mini-doll wearing it look extremely odd.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This is a very quick and easy build, there are no parts of any of the models in the set that are too difficult as one should expect in a LEGO Friends set of this size and price point. Each model is really fun to build too, from the pizza oven to the stand that Stephanie uses to sell to her friends and other denizens of Heartlake City. There&rsquo;s also a great build for an outdoor table and pair of chairs to sit at when eating, the only thing in this build that is a bit too simple is the small scooter, which doesn&rsquo;t involve a lot of pieces to add elements to the core body for a delivery scooter.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Pizza Stand: This little model is really fun looking, it&rsquo;s your basic side-of-the-road food stand with a very limited space for your mini-doll to stand behind it. The front has a pizza on top for a sign and another pizza can be placed on the counter to be picked up by someone for a meal, there&rsquo;s also a five cent coin and a hundred dollar bill. A few flower buds are used to add a bit of greenery to the front and in the back, Stephanie has a telephone receiver to take orders with. Judging how small this operation is I&rsquo;m a bit surprised she can swing home deliveries since this isn&rsquo;t exactly a big storefront or anything like that.</p>

<p>Pizza Oven: This little oven is a pretty good little model, it&rsquo;s designed like an old fashioned bread oven with an open front and a large brown paddle to remove the cooked pizza from it. The design is pretty clever and I enjoy the use of the new 1x4 mason brick to break up the look of it.</p>

<p>Outdoor Eating Area: This is the biggest treat from this set in my mind, the table is built simply enough with cylinders and round plates, but it just looks solid. You can place a pizza, two glasses, a bowl with salad in it and a buildable water bottle on it. The chairs however are really clever, you get two of those revers plates with the studs on the bottom in pink, attached to that are two of the old toolbox pieces for the legs. Overall a great looking mini-model.</p>

<p>Scooter: This is just your standard LEGO Scooter with an added section in back to deliver the pizzas, not much to say here honestly.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This was a pretty good set, I found it quite enjoyable and it makes an excellent display piece in Heartlake City. It&rsquo;s been a while since this set was released though and LEGO has since retired it, so you&rsquo;ll be searching for it on the secondary market if you didn&rsquo;t pick it up when it was available. I&rsquo;d recommend this set.</p>

"Hashem1983","2017-09-14T10:31:40.967Z","Nice Set with Nice Parts","<p>I actually but this set last year for some of its parts, but still this small simple set is wonderful and&nbsp;playable, or even if you are able to add it in one of your restaurant sets.</p>

<p>The box comes in a small size with the &quot;Friends&quot; branding on it. The instruction in this set is not really necessary, as I just by looking at the picture on the box the building was done in 5 minutes MAX.</p>

<p>The Parts in this set are barely basic, however, I liked the accessories in this set like the Pizza, money, glasses, the small build of the water bottle, the salad bowl, telephone piece and the scooter.</p>

<p>The minidoll&nbsp;in this set called Stephanie, she&#39;s wearing a white top with some prints on it, pink shorts and shoes. I got to say I liked the hair piece, it is a rubbery material and could also work with the normal minifigures that I wish they do.</p>

<p>The Complete model, you get a stand, a small wood oven to bake the pizza with a clipping hook on the side to place the oar that is used to input and output the pizza, a nice buildable table with buildable seats for the minidoll&nbsp;and there&#39;s finally the red scooter with a nice quick buildable basket to place the pizza in it.</p>

<p>Overall, its a nice simple tiny set that could be used for its parts, or as a small display,&nbsp;or, as I did, combined it with my 6376 Breezeway Cafe that added a nice touch to it.</p>
