<p>Upon first glance at the box art, a fan could think the lighthouse section is chunky &quot;wall&quot; elements, yet it is not and involves more than 12 &quot;layers&quot; and ~100 bricks.&nbsp; It is very sturdy.&nbsp; Although other LEGO lighthouses are enclosed 360-degrees (which is nice for event displays) this version is open in the back to provide play access.</p>

<p>Although there is no direct hole/opening under the light section, the balcony provides a place to put mini-dolls all around it.&nbsp; The very top room in the lighthouse is meant to be a &quot;secret&quot; room and contains a map tile, also a window to view out with binoculars.</p>

<p>The Ice Cream shop section is also very brick-heavy (compared to other sets in this price range) and is certainly a fun way to learn building techniques for future creations.&nbsp; The roofing slopes and dormer are classic designs.&nbsp; All the extra details of awnings, shutters, window boxes, light sconces, arches, interior display case, and bathroom add not only&nbsp;aesthetic appeal -- yet tons of play and modifying to a builder&#39;s own taste.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Traditional Friends box, 2 instruction booklets, 4 bags of bricks &amp; parts, on 8x16 baseplate (medium Azure) and a sticker sheet.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I wrote about in my introduction, this model takes a bit longer than anticipated -- to my delight!&nbsp; Had I not been building it for a review, I would have taken a long lazy day building, playing, building, and re-arranging, and enjoying.&nbsp; The 4 bags are quite large and even the base (water, beach, pier, grass) uses bricks from 2 bags.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a solid build that can be easily played with (of course!) and set on a shelf for later and/or admired.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard to not smile when looking at it.&nbsp; It certainly brings out memories of trips to coastal areas and lighthouses for me.&nbsp; The moveable ladder adds to notion it&#39;s interactive.&nbsp; The sign on pier swivels, and the huge Ice Cream cone sign out front is super fun to build (and just hold for a minute).&nbsp; Getting an animal like a Seal (which is only in foil pack 41047 and possibly not available everywhere) is a bonus to me -- and it&#39;s very cute in person.&nbsp; As with all LEGO Friends sets, it will complement any Heartlake City layout -- especially with the Dolphin Cruiser nearby.&nbsp; The row boat and Seal on rock formation are not attached; otherwise, again I am impressed at how *solid* of a model it is -- it can be picked up and moved without fear of falling apart.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is exactly the type of LEGO set I would have loved as a kid!&nbsp; I think for being an iconic fixture of the Friends lexicon, this model is perfectly the right combination of bricks to build, playability, and inspiration for loads of imagination.</p>

<p>If you think my set ratings for this are biased, know that this is the first time I have ever given &quot;5&quot; in all categories and it&#39;s also a set I&#39;m not so tempted to &quot;alternate&quot; build anytime soon. (For those who know me, that says a lot ;-)</p>
