<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>I bought this via an auction. So the box was in good enough shape. It has a suitable amount of images for fans to get a good idea of what the set is all about. Instructions were clear and easy to follow. Consisting of three&nbsp;booklets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One of the things that drew me to this set were all of the windows. Sometimes it is hard to find sets with more than the generic square house window and this set does not disappoint. There are some really nice pieces with the set as well, including a dish wear set, the vine archway, and a supply&nbsp;of sticker details.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get the mom, dad, and friends character Emma. All three have very nice outfits. Which as with other friends figures are interchangeable.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Pretty quick&nbsp;as the instructions were clear to follow. One thing&nbsp;that bothers me though is that the left side of the house overlaps the side window on the right side of the house. It may be a flaw in the modular design of the house. But still odd and I did not have the right pieces to fix it myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lots of little details to put together like the mailbox, flower box/ planting bed, easel, bathtub, and kitchen counter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>To be honest though the lavender is a lovely color, it does not fit in with the creator buildings that I own. So I had previously bought a lot of tan pieces and switched them out. &nbsp;;)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The general design of the set is very nice with four&nbsp;complete rooms. Living room, kitchen/dining, bedroom, and bathroom. Including a unique sliding door exiting the bedroom. The set also sports a nifty easel&nbsp;for young Emma to paint to her hearts content. A personal favorite as I have many art hobbies. And I hope the easel&nbsp;sparks a bit of art interest in other fans who will come to own this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a very nice set, sturdy, can be rearranged to suit your preference. Price, rather high. I think the auction I bought it off of was lower. But being that friends is geared towards little girls this set may be out of many families&#39; budget. Which is a shame as it is a very nice house and would make any little girl or adult fan like myself very happy to own. I am very pleased to have this as part of my Lego house collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
