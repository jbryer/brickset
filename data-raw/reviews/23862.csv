<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a small box. The front shows action shot of the set, the back shows some functions of the set. Nothing special about the box.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This may be the most interesting part for the majority of the people buying this set and I&nbsp;get that, the assortment of the parts is really great. You get some good and uncommon sand blue parts, some technic parts and a pair of new brick shooters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs in this set are amazing, Spyclops is great character, menacing, evil looking and detailed overall. On the other side (the good side) is Agent Trey Swift, sporting futuristic looking armor on top of what seems to be tuxedo, sleek sci-fi&nbsp;looking targeting shades and a blonde hair.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quite simple, no problems with it. Few stickers and you get to build the smartphone conductive minibuild which is nice addition but feels like it is just a gimmick.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model itself is visually perfect, but the playability lacks. The playability problem could have been solved by three ratchet&nbsp;joints attached to the legs. But the top part where Spyclops&nbsp;is seated actually rotates along with the bottom laser that Agent Trey can deflect with his translucent shield.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My opinion? Great, has its flaws but for me the set is worth it. I had a great time building it and I&nbsp;even played with it! For me the minifigs were the main draw. To wrap this up, great set, great parts and great minifigs!</p>

<p>This is a fun and cheap set. The Ultra Agent is equipped with a shooter and a blue &quot;energy&quot; shield. The &quot;baddie&quot; is a spiderman turned funny colours and evil.</p>

<p>The build is short but a little fiddly. The technic legs remind me of the Galaxy Quest insect builds or the Alien Conquest Tripods.</p>

<p>Playability is good. The robot has gripping claws on each leg, two stud shooters on the cockpit.&nbsp;The Ultra Agent will be hard pressed to fight this guy off. The little silver spider drones are also cool.</p>

<p>Pros -</p>

<p>Fun</p>

<p>Cheap</p>

<p>Cons -</p>

<p>Not very posable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a nice little addition to the Ultra Agents line.</p>
