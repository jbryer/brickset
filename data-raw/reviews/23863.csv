<p>This incorporated a new design I have never,if rarely seen before.It has a central build consisting of parts,then the &quot;Wheels&quot; are connected via connector bits and then builds on....The building experience was very enjoyful,especially when I built the vehicle.</p>

<p>The minifigures and bank vault was a cool addition to the set,just like the the retired theme &quot;Space Police&quot; back in the 2000s that had space police in spaceships catching criminals.The bank vault was actually cool,as the architecture was very unique in this set!</p>

<p>The AppBrick,which is a lego piece used &nbsp;for the ULTRA Agents App,was a first-of-it&#39;s-kind that I have seen so far and so far,I haven&#39;t seen any other themes with this device.I am dying to try it out!&#39;</p>

<p>It was very fun to play with,as you can easily take apart the shape and turn it into a new design.For the Imaginative mind,this is for YOU!</p>

<p>The monetary value I am sure is justified,with all these cool features,it is a great set!</p>

<p>Overall,very cool set with interesting design,and unique parts that make this a special!</p>
