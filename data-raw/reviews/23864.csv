<p>The box isn&#39;t that spectacular and really shows everything you need to know&nbsp;about the set. On the backside there are some examples that suggest the bad guy is after the jewel which seems to be radiating as he holds it with the spikes of his weapons. Maybe that&#39;s the reason for his lunacy?</p>

<p>Parts wise, you almost get half Technic, half normal because the clever gear mechanism is a big part of the set. I really like the colour scheme being yellow (in a somewhat darker hue) and orange combined with the canopy&#39;s trans-red. However, you don&#39;t get plenty of parts for your money, but as some of them are bigger in size the model&nbsp;looks quite substantial when completed. The small trans-red satellite dishes also are a cool dash of colour at the back of the vehicle. The rest are some plates, slopes and braces but nothing really you would want to have in large amounts&nbsp;for free building.</p>

<p>The coolest fig here is the mad spelunker. He wears a fairly&nbsp;plain armour with a pin at the back and an airman&#39;s helmet plus some&nbsp;red-toned shades&nbsp;that protect him from sunlight after long drills downhole. There&#39;s nothing much to the Ultra Agent&nbsp;except he wears a tie under his combat dress and some sort of futuristic monocle device in his face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with most sets the build is fun and it took me about 40 minutes,&nbsp;I guess. However, there weren&#39;t any big surprises when advancing&nbsp;throughout the building &nbsp;steps. Pushing the axles through the beams into the cogwheels was a bit tricky at times and it might be frustrating for smaller kids to get it right. There are many unnecessary stickers of which I only applied the one in the cockpit. Putting the finished treads around the wheels is always a gratifying experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>My overall opinion about this set is a positive one. It&#39;s fun to wheel it around and see the gear mechanism in action. I think generally all those functions really are the highlight of any of the Agents sets. It takes a little getting used to the&nbsp;design of the vehicle resembling a mole, spider or bug but as a whole it makes perfect sense to me.&nbsp;</p>
