"creapie","2015-02-17T07:07:38.733Z","Great Set for Play but disappintment with Appbricks","<p>This is my first attempt at review as a parent (through the eyes of my 6 years old) as well as as an AFOL.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Packaging is what sells to children. The Lego box art are always really impressive including this one. It showed a lot of playability of the set which helps me decide to buy the set to add to our existing Ultra Agents theme.</p>

<p>The medium-sized box is as usual with pop tabs which I dislike. But somehow it&#39;s almost the highlight for my 6 y.o. Inside are three numbered bags. But one thick solid book with glued spine. Not sure I like it compared to smaller multiple booklets with stapled binding. Because on the first flip to start the build, my book has a white fold line on the cover. Not nice.</p>

<p>Instructions are otherwise clear n straight forward. Easily understood by a 6 y.o. Even tho the set is intended for 9 to 14.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I am not sure I am a good gauge at parts, since I have never played Lego as a child and have just started with Lego classic and creator a year ago. The Ultra Agents sets seems to me to have a good mix of technic parts. I enjoyed the difference and variety it brings. The wheels are big! Good add to our collection. The neon green transparent parts are the favourite for my 6 y.o. But the Appbricks which he was looking forward to did not live up to his child expectations.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Even tho we already have one Toxikita and Brainstein, my 6 y.o. claims they are different and is cool to have. The transparent aqua blue amour for one of the agent is new to us and interesting.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took about 3 hours for my unfortunately easily distracted 6 y.o. to finish on his own. I could have most probably done it in one. But he loves the building process. Mainly the vehicle took multiple phase to complete. Highlight of one new building technique for him is the suspension of the vehicle. The rest are quite standard.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The vehicle turned out bigger than we expected, mainly due to the huge wheels and the case embeded on it. But it looks cool and dangerous. The green robot for Toxikita looks good too and is a welcomed opponent for play. Having P.U.P. is a fun addition.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>We integrated our play with the free App, thus attempting the use of the Appbrick. But unfortunately to great disappointment. As it was not exactly easy with our small Galaxy Tab 3&nbsp; screen. The contact was flimsy with my small fingers to hold down 4 bricks at one time. We therefore did not even proceed to play any games. The constant rebuild of the Gadget was at first a challengen and after the 4th time in 10 minutes, the interest was lost. Not just for my 6 y.o. but for me. It ended with more frustrations than fun.</p>

<p>So we went back to just plain play with our set. The set itself gives a lot of actions and fun, including rebuilding and altering, which my 6 y.o. loves. And I enjoy rebuilding his mess back to the original. For that we had fun on an entire Sunday with this Set. And now after, the play with the 2 other U.A. sets we have continues. I love this theme. And I think this set/vehicle is a good add at a medium budget to the U.A. theme. Though I would not buy it at full price.</p>

<p>Before we start this review, let me apologize for the lack of pictures. I wasn&#39;t able to obtain any for this set. Also, though I love the set, I think its an Agents remake.&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Hmm, where have we seen this before? An agent four-wheeler battling an evil villain with toxic guns, both sides loaded with&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">weaponry? Personally, I think this set is sort of a remake of&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8969-1/4-Wheeling-Pursuit"" style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">8969</a><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">.</span></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box front is pretty average for this price range, longer than it is tall. The front shows the Agents battling Toxikita&nbsp;and her mech while trying to save the scientist.&nbsp;The front also shows off the various parts and advertises the app brick. The top shows the minifigures, the sides show a Lego club ad and an app brick ad, and the bottom has the barcode. The back shows off the play features and has an alternate scenario with Toxikita all tied up.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some very nice parts in transparent blue as well as some in bright green. I would say the highlights are <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-20208"">20208</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-20500"">20500</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-62576"">62576</a>, and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-15361"">15361</a>. (Note that all of these are the light blue&nbsp;variation).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four minifigures included in this set. Professor Brainstein is the civilian included, and him and his secret plans are the target of the mission. He has two faces: scared and normal. He has nice printing on the front and back of his torso but none on hs legs.</p>

<p>Toxikita is the villain of the set. She has her bright green hair which I believe is exclusive to her character. Her armor is exclusive to this set. She has printing on the front of her torso and legs and on the back of her torso. She has two faces: confident and angry.</p>

<p>Agent Trey Swift is one of the two protagonists of this set. He has very intricate printing down his torso and on the back of his torso. He has only one face, which is wearing high-tech sunglasses. He actually reminds me a lot of Agent Swipe from the original Agents series.</p>

<p>Agent Jack Fury is by far the most detailed of the four. He has great printing down the front of his torso and legs, and the back of his torso. He has only one face: confident. However, he has the awesome new Ultra Agents body armor and helmet, and is the only one of the two agents included to have a weapon.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set come with one instruction booklet for the whole set. Nevertheless, the build is easy to follow and KFOLs, AFOLs, and TFOLs&nbsp;alike should be able to do it. There are&nbsp;some nice SNOT techniques employed on the sides and some greebling along the entire thing. Though the build felt simple at times, it was never boring or repetitive except for on the wheels.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is quite impressive. Toxikita&#39;s mech&nbsp;is relatively large compared to the number of pieces it uses. However, the arms are excessively long and touch the ground even while standing up. However, there is a great amount of posability in it. The Appbrick&nbsp;looks okay but is useless to me, since I use an Android device. The robo-dog&nbsp;is especially good-looking considering it only uses something like ten pieces. However, the whole thing is all hinges so it is quite flimsy to me. The truck itself looks great. It has two stud shooters as well as a spring loaded shooter with a grappling hook and string attached. The metallic grey and light blue complement each other nicely. The prison container is held in place by two Technic axles and the grappling hook shooter mechanism, which moves up and backwards on a hinge. Two rubber bands provide great suspension, so the whole thing can go up and down almost an entire inch! There are many adjustable lights and other greebles&nbsp;along the whole thing. Overall, the set looks great and its play features work well, though I would have given the grappling hook some more string.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite what I said about this being a remake, you can&#39;t help but love this set. It is fun to build and play with. Overall score: 5/5.</p>
