<p>Normal fair (colorful, fun to look at, playability intent).</p>

<p>The colors in the instruction book can be a bit confusing at times.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a substantial number of technic parts to this set. &nbsp;I&#39;m not familiar with Technic, so there are a few new items to me that served to increase the fun factor for me. &nbsp;I LOVE the big engine nacelle pieces.</p>

<p>Colors are consistent&nbsp;throughout with the Ultra Agents Theme. &nbsp;This set presents a wide array and assortment of various parts of all shapes, sizes and construction types. &nbsp;This is one of my all time favorite sets for parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with 4 minifigs&nbsp;and they set the bar quite high for other minifigs&nbsp;IMO. &nbsp;The print on each is extraordinary. &nbsp;I appreciate that LEGO keeps working to consistently improve various aspects of their product and they have done so here.</p>

<p>The helmet on Max Burns is great! &nbsp;It appears as though it is composed of two separate parts, one opague&nbsp;white part and a trans blue part. &nbsp;He also has a printed backpack, but it seems to be a bit incomplete. &nbsp;There is a great opportunity here to create your own jets to fit to the back of the pack; it has two clips that would hold any number of items.</p>

<p>Antimatter&#39;s printing is fantastic. &nbsp;His head glows in the dark, but with his hood on, only his eyes are exposed. &nbsp;He has a parts built staff with a nice printed piece included. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Max Burns and Caila Phoenix include stud shooters that are minimally&nbsp;parts built (2 gun parts and 1 stud). &nbsp;Solomon Blaze comes with a walkie-talkie.</p>

<p>LEGO&#39;s website states that &quot;all minifigures included are new and exclusive to this set&quot;.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As stated before, the build involves a fair amount of Technic building and I enjoyed that far more than I thought I would. &nbsp;There is a lot of Studs Not On Top building and I have always enjoyed and appreciated that technique. &nbsp;The Techic&nbsp;parts and building technique provide some fun moving components to the Ultracopter and those features are what make this set really stand out.</p>

<p>There is room for some modding if the builder wishes to do so. &nbsp;e.g. add a&nbsp;floor inside the fuselage that swings down so&nbsp;that&nbsp;the wench would still be able to operate from inside the Ultracopter. &nbsp;I&#39;m also going to&nbsp;add a clear 1x1 stud to the forward landing gear to finish the look.</p>

<p>Because of the design of the model and the brilliant build; the playability of this set is sky high! &nbsp;There are MANY moving parts (relative to most sets) and the counter rotating rotors are FUN to build and FUN to operate. &nbsp;The wench is operated from the outside of the model. &nbsp;The engines swing forward and backward and are both connected to an ingenious control mechanism that is parts built&nbsp;and sits inside the tail. &nbsp;The nose gear turns 360 degrees and the mains are solid. &nbsp;The dual cockpits is well designed and gives the Ultracopter an attack helicopter appearance. There are 4 spring loaded shooters on this thing!&nbsp; The copter is bristling with guns and the whole thing is menacing looking!</p>

<p>Antimatter&#39;s scooter is very basic, but fun! &nbsp;The colors are fantastic. &nbsp;His staff is colorful and fun. The scooter has two flick missiles on it.</p>

<p>There are a number of stickers in this set, but there are also a couple of printed pieces that look great.</p>

<p>The set includes a small construction that is a app brick build to make an Appbrick Gadget&nbsp;for the LEGO My City app for tablets and phones. &nbsp;I cannot speak to its use since I haven&#39;t used it. &nbsp;For those who use app bricks with the app, this will be a nice addition to the set.</p>

<p>The total build took me somewhere around 3 hours of leisurely building fun. &nbsp;I thoroughly enjoyed it! &nbsp;It feels strong enough for play and looks great as a display. &nbsp;Home run, LEGO!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>One of LEGO&#39;s best in a long time! &nbsp;An instant classic for me. &nbsp;I believe that Ultra Agents will be remembered as a truly great theme and this model is one of the reasons why. &nbsp;The price per part is a tad high, but the fun factor goes up to 11!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Just get it. &nbsp;You&#39;ll be happy you did.</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-19T11:59:27.397Z","Chopper Action","<p>If Lego did an Airwolf (1980s TV helicopter) it would do well to be half as good as this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is fun. A number of techniques are used to make the shape you see, including side attachment,&nbsp;pop out technic winglets&nbsp;and my favourite, contra-rotating rotor blades powered by technic gears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a big set. It&#39;s as long as my keyboard with over 600 parts, though some are very small. It dominates a desk&nbsp;and can only be swooshed with two hands....</p>

<p>It comes with 4 minifigs including a &quot;baddie&quot;. The options for play and story&nbsp;telling are infinite. It has two spring loaded shooters and two stud&nbsp;shooters on each side of the helicopter. You run out of hands before you run out of things to shoot. Two of the minifigs also have stud shooters. Solomon Blaze only has a walkie talkie, but he can be brought&nbsp;aboard by a winch with a handle so he can still get in on the action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got this second hand for &pound;50 sterling. I amy happy with this price but didn&#39;t get a box or instructions.</p>

<p>Pros -</p>

<p>Big and impressive looking.</p>

<p>Lots of minifigs and opportunities for&nbsp;play.</p>

<p>Great techniques to learn.</p>

<p>The twin rotors are quite show stopping!</p>

<p>The pop out jet engines are also fun.</p>

<p>The Ultra Agents theme is fun and can make any regular lego city more exciting!</p>

<p>Cons -</p>

<p>The grey storage doors have little room and seem a bit pointless due to the gearbox for the rotors.</p>

<p>The 3rd minifig has very little space to stand on as the bottom of the helicopter is open for the winch, almost not worth including.</p>

<p>The knob that turns&nbsp;the rotors is away underneath and could do with being a little bigger to make it easier to turn and hold the helicopter. I might swap mine out at some point.</p>

<p>Overall a great set with lots of opportunities for fun!</p>
