<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is nothing new. Just the generic container for all the fun packed inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;The peices are unique, and the new guns are cool, but I prefer the more accurate looking guns of old.</p>

<h3>Mini figures</h3>

<p>The mini figures are worth it and they relly do make the set. They added a new non-growling face for the captain. The normal commandos have a clone armor torso in a nice blue color. They also have a nice helmet mold.They look very accurate. The captain&#39;s&nbsp;printing is terrific, and you can really tell who&#39;s the boss.&nbsp;I was a little disappointed that they didn&#39;t have much variation in the heads, as they aren&#39;t clones, and it would have been cool if they made some kind of custom pauldron for the captain to represent his larger shoulder plate.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very easy. Some&nbsp;cool parts, such as the stud launching Gatling gun on the cannon and the nice maroonish/ dark red colored pieces&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think it&#39;s a great set. I love the firing mechanism&nbsp; for the cannon. It&#39;s&nbsp;a nice little weapon. I don&#39;t know why, but&nbsp;It reminds me a little of the cannons that you see on the republic cruisers&nbsp;at the beginning space battle of episode III.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While senate commandos aren&#39;t a must-have, and it&#39;s an odd idea for a battle pack, I&nbsp;encourage people to get it,&nbsp;especially people with a large clone army, or if you have a lot of senators to guard.</p>

"Monkeyman3838","2015-02-24T22:37:27.123Z","Possibly the greatest battle pack of all time!","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard box, about a foot long or a little over that. A 28 page instruction manual is also included.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It includes one of the most anticipated, if not the most anticipated pieces of the year in the fireable gatling gun. The gear piece turns in the back, turning the yellow piece that has a slight ridge that pops the blue studs off! It launches extremely far. It also includes some of the highly controversial blasters that actually blast.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are awesome! The commander is by far the best one with his white printing even though he&#39;s a traitor :D. The others are a major improvement from the old ones with leg printing and more detailed torso printing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;build takes about 10 to 15 minutes since it&#39;s such a small set. The cool thing is that the vehicle can go up and down for better angles and better playability.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great model! It is the best battle pack in the last 10 years, if not ever. The Endor Rebel pack comes close, however. :D I think that it is a really good price for the minifigures you get, and the vehicle!<img class=""mainimg"" src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/small/75088-1.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I HIGHLY recommend this set! If you&#39;re short on cash but really want a Lego set, GO GET THIS ONE. Hours of fun are in store for kids, teenagers, and adults alike! Thanks for reading!<br />
Monkeyman3838, out.</p>

When I had purchased this set a few years ago, I was super excited because I could finally get senate commandos in an affordable set. Back then, I could not really afford a my of the other sets senate commandos were in so I was happy. The packaging was the same as always. nothing new. The instructions were easy to follow. Parts were great, l loved the maroon red peices, however, back then I did not like stud shooters but they have now grown on me. Still not my favorite but they are fine. The turret was amazing! I loved the maroon blocks and I also thought the design was cool in general. The minifigures&nbsp;really are the best part of the set. There were three commandos and one commando captain. I was thrilled to be able to get these minifigures at a price I could afford. I personally love senate commandos and wish more had been done with them in the clone wars, so it was great that I could now have some to play with. A lot of people online day that Lego &quot;ruined&quot; the Senate commandos because they were so rare and limited, and now&nbsp; Lego made them&nbsp; common. That is actually why I was happy about this set. I could finally have some. It was just too bad for people that they no longer could brag about their commandos. This was a great move by Lego and a great set.&nbsp; I wish I bought a second so I can build a squad for my republic army. If you did not buy this set. You missed out. You should definitely figure out a way to get it on ebay. I have most of the battle&nbsp; packs from 2013 or later, and this may be the best. I love the Senate commandos.&nbsp;</p>
