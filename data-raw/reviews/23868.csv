<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very nicely detailed and makes me want to watch the new season of Ninjago. I admit I haven&#39;t watched it but the pictures on the box makes me want to know what&#39;s going on in the story! Size-wise, its normal sized, nothing else to say here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve got quite a few technic parts, but if you&#39;ve seen the pictures before buying the set its not a surprise; there&#39;s that odd technic part sticking out under the tail of the plane. The best parts for me are those few pieces you get in bright orange, which I haven&#39;t personally seen outside of Chima sets. Other than that, there aren&#39;t any&nbsp;new pieces. I may be wrong though.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are what made me buy the set. I love the bad guys&#39; snake hat, the tattoos over their torso and the two bone swords you get in the set. One of the bad guys also has that cool armor which I want more of. MOCers looking for minifigs&nbsp;that have that savage look will love these. the bad guys&#39; pants, less interesting for me but still nicely printed are&nbsp;purple chains hanging down.&nbsp;Cole has a new outfit, very detailed and looking as cool as ever. None of the minifigs have double-sided heads.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The set comes in two bags while the wheel used in front of the cockpit wasn&#39;t in a bag. bag one builds&nbsp;the minifigs, the jungle part used for hiding by the bad guys(I&#39;m assuming)&nbsp;and the base of the plane, which includes the technic part under the tail. &nbsp;You might thinking if its some kind of trigger or something for the missiles in the front? Well not really, it&#39;s just a handle. But its really useful! Bag number two finishes the plane.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was not too hard but with the technic parts, some 7 year olds might find it challenging in my opinion. I thought it the design for shooting the missiles was very clever and had a lot of fun building it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Whoever designed this set deserves a thumbs up. I am very satisfied with how it all comes together. While at first glance the lack of landing gears and the protruding technic part under the tail kind of put me off, once you have the set&nbsp;in your hand&nbsp;and you understand its usefulness in terms of playability, I quickly changed my mind. as for the missile shooting mechanism, there are technic gears on either side of the plane that you can turn with the thumb of whichever hand is holding the plane.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;will make the front of the plane turn, shooting the missiles, so you can use either your right or left hand.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Wow. I had bought the set for the&nbsp;</span>minifigs<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;first and the plane second, so maybe my expectations weren&#39;t built up very high, but regardless&nbsp;this set is very well done and I am extremely happy for having bought it. it looks great, the kids will enjoy having that handle under the tail so they can swish it all around the house while shooting those missiles just using one hand.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">One little warning though, there are eight missiles in front of this plane and they shoot far and fast! the mechanism used to shoot them requires a certain amount of force and I haven&#39;t been able to shoot less than three missiles at the same time. Its a veritable machine gun! sometimes it would shoot 6 of the 8 missiles. the kids will love this. Just be careful. And buy this set.</span></p>
