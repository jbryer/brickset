The characters, the items, it&#39;s a sight to behold! And only for the low, low price of $39.99! So, without further adieu, let&#39;s start the review. For the appetizer of this two-course meal of a review, an overview of the&nbsp;Minifigures involved in this spectacular set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chop&#39;rai</strong></p>

<p><strong>?</strong>The strong, yet dimwit Anacondrai&nbsp;legitimate snake. I mean, come on people! Chen, Eyezor, and Clouse; they&#39;re all people, wearing Anacondrai clothes! It&#39;s a disgrace to call them Anacondrai. Anyway, he is a pretty powerful foe, who has a grand Anacondrai armor piece, and an Anacondrai sword. Plus, may I note, looks and awful lot like Pythor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Clouse</strong></p>

<p>Ok, here we go. Clouse is Chen&#39;s second in command, who, as I noted, doesn&#39;t look like an Anacondrai at all. However, this Clouse is two-headed, so the other side is his wizardy side, which makes him look more like an Anacondrai, but just a little bit. He holds no weapon or armor, but he can use spells. Plus, the guard tower that comes with this set has spears for him to use, just in case backup is needed. Nothing special here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Titanium Zane</strong></p>

<p>Ok, this guy is the best in this set. I mean, he was ok before the transformation, but now, he&#39;s a legend! With this set, he is two-headed, with one side showing his scanner, and the other showing his more human side. In the rear of his dragon, his weapon is located: two golden daggers. Pretty cool, right? Not only that, but his main goal is a good one: Retrieve the golden key to save his friends. I guess his memory card wasn&#39;t destroyed. Anyway, great Minifigure, and a reliable addition to the team.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, now for the main course: the model, of course!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Anacondrai Outpost</strong></p>

<p>This part is a vital part of the set. The golden key, surrounded by white fangs, is Zane&#39;s target, but first he will have to get past defenses. It will be tricky, for both ways in are tricky. Going on the ground would mean facing scary Chop&#39;rai, and avoiding Clouse&#39;s&nbsp;spells. Using the Titanium Dragon in the air would be a bit easier, but there is also a catapult to launch at it. So basically, it&#39;s got a lot of defense. Nice move guys.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Titanium Dragon</strong></p>

<p>So far, this is the second-best dragon, next to the Ultra Dragon. I mean all of the others: Fire Dragon, Ice Dragon, Lightning Dragon, Earth Dragon, Golden Dragon, and even the Nindroid&nbsp;MechDragon, are not near the awesomeness of this one, in my opinion. I&#39;d compare to the Morro&nbsp;Dragon, but I wanna own it first. So yeah, that means I OWN all of these dragons. Anyway, some of it&#39;s features are the saddle, the Ice Symbols Flag, the awesome ice tail, and the rotating head. Also, did I mention that it can STAND UP???!!! Yep, it can!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s all from me guys. I&#39;ll be posting more real soon!</p>

"kelko585","2015-10-09T20:03:25.66Z","Zane's reincarnation and his amazing new ride!","<p>By the time that I am reviewing this&nbsp;set&nbsp;the ghost wave of sets is already over but due to my budget I was able to acquire this set only now. Since I try to keep up with the cartoon and Zane is my favorite ninja of the bunch this was a must buy, not necessarily&nbsp;for the set but for the figures.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set came in a standard tournament of elements box, front shows the dragon attacking the anacondrai&nbsp;outpost while the back shows all the features, nothing special.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Part selection in this set is very good, not excellent but high above average. Few pieces to point out are: silver &quot;feather&quot; pieces, transparent blue knights joint, medium azure cheese slopes and nice selection of dark dan pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures were my primary interest in this set and since titanium Zane is exclusive to this set it may be a big draw for Ninjago fans.</p>

<p>Zane: In this set Zane appears as new reincarnated Titanium Zane (mine seemed to be made out of abs plastic, strange). This version of Zane sports the standard zukin&nbsp;robe with an additional&nbsp;flare to it. His cowl and arms are made of silver plastic to represent his metallic upgrade&nbsp;while his torso and legs are light grey probably due to manufacture restrictions. Zane&#39;s face has double sided face print one side being more normal smiling face and the another being technical &quot;hud&quot; interface. One neat little detail is small text printed on his hud face that reads C:/&gt; PXL.</p>

<p>Clouse: Clouse&nbsp;is Master Chen&#39;s evil right hand and magic enthusiast. In the show he was seen as quiet and mischievous mage, I liked him in the show but I like him even more as a minifig! He sports a Kanan style haircut, nice sharply detailed armor&nbsp;and double sided face. This minifig is very accurate&nbsp;to the show but I can&#39;t remember when he had crazed green eyed look, maybe when he was casting some spells. Accurate or not this minifig is amazing, I&#39;d even say overshadowed by Zane.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chop&#39;rai: This anacondrai warrior is supposed to be just a generic henchman but in my opinion he is great. This minifig is more snake than human, so it features snake tail and new molded head. Aside from his snake-ish&nbsp;appearance&nbsp;he features new anacondrai&nbsp;armor and sword.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build consists of two major parts, the anacondrai&nbsp;outpost and the dragon itself. Building&nbsp;both the outpost and dragon doesn&#39;t take much time but it isn&#39;t that long either. I actually had quite lot of fun with the build, there were multiple moments where I went &quot;oh neat!&quot;, mainly with the head and wing attachment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The anacondrai&nbsp;outpost is okay addition&nbsp;to the set.&nbsp;It&#39;s not amazing but is a nice place to display minifigs and has a acid bola launcher play-feature on side. I am not sure what&nbsp;the key is for, but there is one spare included.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Titanium dragon is an amazing model great for play and display. The dragon&nbsp;is not that poseable&nbsp;but since the dragon looks amazing I can forgive the lack of poseability. I&#39;ve seen mixed opinions regarding the head, in my opinion it&#39;s great that LEGO has swiched over to brick built dragon heads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>To conclude this review I will say that if you want to get some larger (non-licensed) set, get this one. Even if you are not Ninjago&nbsp;fan I&#39;d recommend this one for it&#39;s ingenuous design. One last thing I have to point out are the stickers.&nbsp;While there is fair number of them I love those on the wings, the design on them is amazing even though they are different silver than the wings they blend in amazingly.</p>

"BlueBen1111","2016-10-02T03:29:58.98Z","From skeptical to pleased.","<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>This set includes three minifigures, Titanium Zane, Clouse, and Chop&#39;rai.</p>

<p>Titanium Zane: This figure is fabulous with great printing and a even mixture of grey and silver colors. He has two face, one for when he is wearing his hood and the other for when he is not.The only other way to get this figure is from the Dimensions Zane Fun Pack so he is a fairly rare and exclusive minifigure.</p>

<p>Clouse: This minifigure is exclusive to this set with the exception of a European (I think) foil pack. He has an exclusive face print and hair mold and two faces. He has some nice printing also.</p>

<p>Chop&#39;rai: Fairly basic snake figure has some nice printing and introduced new snake head mold.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>When I first saw the images for this set I was skeptical about the build as it looked a bit thin and flimsy. However, after purchasing this set I thoroughly enjoyed the build and think its proportions, although still a bit off, are quite good.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The outpost for the Clouse and Chop&#39;rai is a nice build with some clips holding some spears and a catapult that launches a ball and chain weapon. The center holds a golden key in between some teeth.</p>

<p>The dragon is a magnificent build with such a great mixture of colors. The trans-medium blue 1x1 cheese slopes are probably my favorite pieces on this set as they really add a better icy color than normal trans-light blue. The wings are on the gappy side but there range of motion&nbsp;is great. I LOVE the brick built head! The legs are nice however the silver plating on the front legs tend to fall off sometimes.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>Overall, I absolutely love this set.The minifigure selection is great and the dragon has a perfect blend of colors and poseablity! The side build is quite nice and gives the bad guys some defense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I hope this helped!</p>

The playability&nbsp;is really good.what you get from the price is amazing!(for the original price of 40 $ but being an asian buying it from in country meaning that most sets cost almost double the original price,which is why i shop on the online lego shop now) the minifigs are nice the new zane looks amazing,clouse&nbsp;is cool altho i kinda prefer&nbsp;his hood or some magic&nbsp;pieces ( the ones that came from the magazine ) the snake guy has really nice prints!altho i kinda prefer having another ninja. The shrine build is ok (6/10) they definatly&nbsp;could have done something better the catapult doesnt even work good its really hard to properly launch it.overall this set is really nice!</p>
