Until now, in my opinion, its the most impressive of all space sets. It has a great playability, its not overboarded with useless details but still with the perfect amount of them, so it is really something special. The big brother of the LL918 it was.
The space station is nice also, and the little buggy was increasing the playability of it. 4 minifigs and some walkie talkies, what more should you want? Maybe lego star wars is nice, but this is the thing for me ;)

"skinnylawyer","2013-03-25T04:31:42.313Z","Hard to find, and completely worth it.","<p>I recently went on an eBay bidding spree that more than doubled my Classic Space collection, and among them was this set, Galaxy Explorer. Back in my childhood, Set 483, Alpha-1 Rocket Base, was my only Space set, but I knew of many other gorgeous contemporary Space sets, and would have loved to have the Galaxy Explorer. Well, over a quarter of a century later and as a grown-up, I finally have Galaxy Explorer as part of my lunar base, and I am very happy about it! While my example has some play wear and many pieces yellowed due to sun exposure, it is still presentable, and unlike most examples, 100% complete.</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instruction booklet is quite similar to those found in modern-day grownup-grade Lego sets, in that each step lists the types and quantities of pieces necessary. Considering the complexity of this set, I found that information very helpful. The booklet builds the spaceship first, then the control tower, and finally the buggy.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>Typical early Classic Space, with lots of light gray, blue, and transparent yellow. Many light gray parts are sloped/diagonal, to make up the distinctive shape of the spaceship, which somewhat resembles the Star Destroyers from the contemporary <i>Star Wars</i> movies.</p><p>Lots of round nozzle type pieces for the engines, which would become handy if I wanted to rebuild the spaceship into a different design as a MOC.</p><p>A fair number of parts are printed/embossed, and the markings are quite durable.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Four classic astronaut minifigures are included: two red, and two white. They also come with various tools, including a pair of walkie-talkies, a wrench, and a gun. This set alone can make for many different scene possibilities due to the four astronauts being able to perform many different roles.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build starts with the light gray tiles making up the main chassis of the ship; it is quite a sturdy base to attach other parts of the ship to. Included in this build is a swing-down ramp mechanism for the rear cargo bay.</p><p>The blue canopy is built, with yellow transparent windows, to form the passenger and cargo compartments.</p><p>The underside of the ship is rather simple and generic - a few pillar and nozzle pieces to make up the landing gear. Compared to even slightly later ships such as Set 6929 Starfleet Voyager, the underside is outright primitive.</p><p>Nevertheless as a whole, this is a large spaceship (a foot or so in length) and it does take about two hours or so to build.</p><p>The control tower and the buggy are straightforward simple builds.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Very imposing, between the size of the spaceship and the two base plates.</p><p>I like two features of the completed ship in particular: the design of the cargo compartment, which has wheel grooves and a ramp to allow the loading of the buggy onto the ship, and the roomy cockpit, which can take at least one passenger, or even two, in addition to the pilot. This makes the spaceship suitable for a number of different missions - perhaps a trip to a distant planet or asteroid so that the buggy can be taken there for exploration, or a trip back to Earth for the astronauts to take a vacation.</p><p>As is always the case with Lego products, this model works better in conjunction with other sets. In particular, I think the set works best when placed with other very early Classic Space sets with 3-digit set numbers, in particular Set 483 (Alpha-1 Rocket Base).</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I now have sixteen Classic Space sets, which span the years from 1978 to 1984. Although the Galaxy Explorer is among the oldest of my collection, it still is easily the most spectacular and the most interesting. It was the original flagship of the Space line, and even compared to modern Lego sets (including ones for grownup collections), this set holds up extremely well. Thanks to well-designed compartments and four minifigures, this set offers lots of play possibilities.</p><p>The main concern with this set is finding a good example. Because of its age and high piece count, it is very difficult to find an example that is complete and in good condition, especially at reasonable prices. I lucked out by being the only bidder on an eBay auction, and even my complete set has some parts yellowing, a few incorrect replacement parts, and one cracked part. At least the incorrect replacement parts were replaced with correct ones once I got the set in my possession, so at least my example is complete, correct, and quite presentable now. Finding a decent example (or finding replacement parts, since most of the printed parts are no longer made new) will be quite a bit of work, but it will be worth it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,3
"Faefrost","2014-07-28T20:20:57.687Z","Possibly the single best most iconic Lego set ever!","<p>OK I know I write this one through the deep deep fog of nostalgia and remembrance of the 11 year old boy who first laid hands on one of these. But this is unarguably the best Lego set ever. This was ground zero for so many of us. This was the moment Lego stopped simply being building blocks and took us somewhere else. Someplace we could never actually go. Lego has always been a toy fueled by imagination. In this one moment Lego pried open our heads and poured in rocket fuel and pointed us to the stars. And nothing was the same again.</p>

<p>As far as the set itself? It remains a remarkable example of a truly well designed set that holds up quite well over time. The ship while a little blocky by todays standards is still amazingly sleek. The build remains solid and swooshable. While some of the classic space parts that it uses have proven to be a bit more fragile than Lego would have liked, over the years. I suspect this was more an effect of the sheer love and amount of play these sets received. Many of them have held up in good condition over the years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The baseplates remain the things of legend. Why oh why does Lego not give us more landing pad plates? The little control station sets the scene nicely. The buggy its little nesting thing of wonder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are absolutely no negatives to this set save the shear prices that they can command on the aftermarket. My advice get a good used one for a lower price. Preferably a little faded, scuffed and play worn. Every mark on it was from someone loving it. Celebrate that joy of play.</p>

"Ignatius","2012-07-24T14:40:24.07Z","The Holy Grail of Classic Space Lego","<p>Just looking at this set makes me smile. It evokes memories of spending time ""snowed in"" at a friends house and hours of fun with&nbsp;the galaxy explorer&nbsp;as the central figure. This set came out close to the release of Star Wars and it happily&nbsp;fed the&nbsp;imagination of an 11 yr old who was already getting into Sci- Fi. I vividly remember the Christmas morning when I opened it, I had asked for the smaller 487 Space Cruiser but my parents got this instead since it was bigger and looked cooler, I had no regrets! I ended up giving away all of my childhood lego collection and then as an adult&nbsp;when I started buying and selling on ebay, I realized that I could again own the sets I loved as a kid and with bricklink there to help me find those missing pieces or instructions, I was again hooked on space lego.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The whole classic space theme was as I understand it a new direction for Lego. It went beyond the chunky bricks and figures with bendy arms and introduced us to the minifig, to angled wings, to sleek design that really did evoke the spirit&nbsp;of what a space ship could be and&nbsp;setting everything on a dull grey lunar landscape just made it seem even more ""out there"". The way I see it, the classic space sets were the turning point for Lego into an even more imaginative direction and they set the groundwork for all the cool stuff that Lego makes today. It all started here folks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>OK so what is great about the Galaxy Explorer?</p><p>It has 4 minifigs and lots of&nbsp;accessories like wrenches and walkie talkies.</p><p>It carries a car inside....thats COOL!</p><p>It is BIG and heavy and was great to swoop around the room in imaginary flight.</p><p>It had its own landing pad and small&nbsp;control tower.</p><p>There was plenty of room on the wings to mount weapons: ( mine were the water cannons from the 1979 lego&nbsp;Fire boat!)</p><p>The design was futuristic: delta wing shapes and a pleasing&nbsp;shape that included hatches that open and the big back doors that could hold a car or several other lego-nauts for a mission.</p><p>The only thing I didnt like were the 3 big rockets on the bottom as they seemed clunky, I removed mine immediately and never looked back.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of innovation, fun to play with, and good parts, I think that this set is the pinnacle of Lego Space, the first and the greatest.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"rab1234","2018-07-12T18:08:44.3Z","Classic Space at its Best","<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>I got 2 of these in a huge box of old sets so it was easier to find all of the pieces as compared with say the Cosmic Fleet Voyager, and build time was significantly less.&nbsp; It&#39;s a unique build with more plates than I expected at the start and the time spent on the hull and moon base was less than I thought it would be.&nbsp; That being said, the build kept my interest and certainly would have warranted 5 stars back in the early 80s when this was produced.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>This is the one category that I need to deduct a star.&nbsp; There are a lot of classic space elements like the gold windshields, radar dish, thrusters, and antenna.&nbsp; However I have a gripe with the flimsy blue and gray tail and side fin pieces.&nbsp; Several were broken and it&#39;s not just the age of the set.&nbsp; I recall having a lot of these break when I had my original copy back in the day.&nbsp; They require too much pressure to get them locked in place and the fin is too skinny.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>The landing pad and base really add to the playability of this set.&nbsp; The ship itself is also probably the best looking classic spaceship; very aerodynamic and sleek looking.&nbsp; My only complaint would be the very small size of the base.&nbsp; This could have been doubled without adding much to the overall cost of the set and would have looked much better and allowed for better play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the money</strong></h2>

<p>$32 back in 1980 (equivalent of about $90 today) may have seemed like a lot for 4 figures and 300 pieces, but you also got two base plates and one of the best looking lego ships that would be available for decades.&nbsp; Considering that a used one goes for about $150 now, this would have been a great buy.&nbsp; Is it worth $150 today?&nbsp; As a collectible sure, but at about the same cost, it certainly can&#39;t hold up against something like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75105-1/Millennium-Falcon""><span>75105: </span> Millennium Falcon</a></p>

<h3>Instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Normal for a 70s or 80s set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with two each of red and white spacemen</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>This set is hard to build. The instructions ask you to put about ten bricks on per step, and I had to dismantle the ship twice to get it right.</p>

<h3>Completed</h3>

<p>Wow. This is a great-looking set. Even people who do not know what it is often remark upon how cool it looks. The ship itself is rather bulky, but still pretty sleek. The cockpit can seat two, or even three if you squeeze them in. The rear section fits the rover with a minifig on it. A really interesting subtle detail is that if you have a fig on the rover, it can be seen through the cargo bay windscreen.</p>

<p>The base is pretty nice too. The ship fits much better onto the landing pad than, say, the Galaxy Commander, and the base itself has all of those fancy printed computer bricks. The amount of figures included is also perfect for playability. You get two to pilot, one to drive the rover, and one to work in the base. Overall, everything about this set is totally perfect.</p>

"Mr__Thrawn","2018-04-25T15:47:59.587Z","Great, Even without the nostalgia","<h2>497/928- Galaxy Explorer</h2>

<p>The LL928&nbsp;&quot;Explorer&quot; starship is the stuff of LEGO legend, and while many love it just for its nostalgic value, I&#39;m going to try to review it as I would any other set. So, is the Galaxy Explorer worth the nearly $250 most charge for it? How does it stack up to modern sets in terms of design and playability? Read on to find out</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are normal for a set of this time period. They feature simple, but still well-done, images of the parts and model. They&#39;re a bit hard to follow, but are still of a relatively high quality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four minifigures in this set. The <strong>red space man</strong>,&nbsp;of which there are two, features a classic space logo on his torso, and that generic, smiling,unisex face. The two&nbsp;<strong>white space men&nbsp;</strong>are essentially the same, but with a white torso, legs, air tanks, and helmet.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Building this model is hard. It took about 2 hours, which is a long time for a 340-part set, and this is mainly due to the instructions asking you to put around 10 parts on per step.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Completed</h3>

<p>When completed, the set looks great. The ship is a little blocky by today&#39;s standards, but still sleek enough, and the moonbase is well done despite its small size. The famed baseplates are just as awesome as I expected, and it all just&nbsp;<em>works</em>.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The set has a good amount of stuff in it, and some basic play features, that make it a pretty good toy, as well as an awesome collector&#39;s item. The rear cargo bay opens, and the little rover can actually roll out, as opposed to today&#39;s &quot;boarding ramps&quot; that you have to shove a minifig up into. The moonbase&nbsp;has a lovely computer and communications dish to signal the rest of your fleet, and there is enough terrain around it for a minifig&nbsp;to explore. There is&nbsp;also a perfect amount of figs, because you have two to sit in the cockpit, one to sit on the rover in the cargo bay or on the terrain around the moonbase, and one to use the computers in the moonbase.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of blue, grey, and trans yellow. There are some nice prints, and a trans-yellow plate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is both a great toy and a great display item.</p>

<p>-Has 4 minigs.</p>

<p>-Even has a landing pad and small base.</p>

<p>-Has a small Rover and even room in the spaceship to store it.</p>
