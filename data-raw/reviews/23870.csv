A great looking Temple in lovely colors combined with a small prison. The set offers a huge playability with 2 hidden traps, 2 shooting devices and no less than 5 great mini figures. The parts are of a great mix and useful for both kids and especially AFOL&#39;s. The price is also no obstacle to own it, I found it RRP in Holland for &euro; 45,00 which is a great deal for a 530 parts set. These new Ninjago sets get better and better, my compliments to the designers.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong> : Aged from 7 years says the age range although I would advise a bit older. You start with the small prison on which you attach a suspension bridge which will connect to the main building. The main building has 2 floors and a mean looking snake head above the entrance. The first step of the stairway has a double great working shooting device triggered by the 2 skull statues on top of the stairs. Entering the first floor you find a hidden hatch with underneath it a sticky trap with a snake, also you find a treasure chest and a weapon rack. The snake head is the final built and contains 2 bright green poison balls which fall out.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : The parts are great starting with the 5 mini figures from which the 2 Anacondrai guys are my favorite : <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/njo125/Zugu"">Zugu</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/njo126/Chen-with-Cape"">Master Chen</a>. The set and mini figures are armed with a load of great weapons and several extra weapons which I consider a great service. Further on so many useful parts that it is hard to lift out some. Still I love the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=98283"">bricks with masonry profile</a>, the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=3960pb031"">big shield</a> and the dark tan slopes and wedges. Like said : lots of extra parts and weapons in this set, great job. Also the big <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=87559"">6 x 6 x 2 corner brick</a> is nice but the color makes it a bit harder to use in MOC projects.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : What can you say, great to built and superb to play with. A main building with shooting device and several traps, a jail and 5 wonderful mini figures with a load of weapons. I would say 5&nbsp;++ !</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : Compare it with for example a set like <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79017-1/The-Battle-of-the-Five-Armies"">The Battle of the 5 Armies </a>than this set offers so much more. The Hobbit is off course&nbsp;a Licensed theme but still a &euro; 25,00 price difference is huge. This set offers a great price per piece, great parts, looks great and has great playability and several exclusive figures so I highly recommend it to both kids and AFOL&#39;s.</p>

<p>Nice box, the final products is about the size of what you see on the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Really interesting parts here. Nice new accessories like bone swords, shoulder pad and skulls. Lots of purple, including unique&nbsp;big 6x6x2 curved bricks. Log bricks, mason bricks and round brick with grille all in decent amount (more than 10 of each). The gong is printed. You also have very interesting spare pieces, including a scimitar, a sa&iuml;, a bone sword, a claw, a katana and a serpent. No extra crossbow sadly.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are great and among the best I&#39;ve seen. They all have legs priting and back printing, but none of them has double sided face. There is a bit of ribcage hanging under the shoulder pads of Zugu. I think ninjas have the same usual faces. The bad guy faces are more interesting with more details and colors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a rather easy build, though the serpent head is a bit more complicated but not hard to build. Putting the skulls on top of the shooters at the entrance of the temple proved to be complicated the way it is suggested in the manual.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is a pretty cool model. Looks pretty much like the lost temple in the jungle of a forgotten civilisation. It did look a bit small before building the serpent head which is quite bulky.</p>

<p>The prison is a bit of a failure since there is obviously a big open space above the bone gate that a ninja can go through to escape.</p>

<p>The temple is nicely done, though the snake head doesn&#39;t look totally convincing to me, depending on how I look at it. Play features are well done, push the skulls and shooters will shoot. Open the snake mouth to drop balls. The trap doors is nicely placed and very well executed, you pull a pin to open it, and push it to close it. One critique is that there is very little space inside the temple and it should be at least 2 studs deeper (there&#39;s just enough room to put the chest and the weapon rack)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Nicely done set with good playability and very nice pieces. Feels like it could be a bit bigger for the price, though I have almost no other set of that price, so I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was long, but thin. Their was one instructions booklet, but it was the biggest non-bound kind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Very nice parts. Tons of tan bricks and other tan parts. There was also some foliage and purple included.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures in this set are good.&nbsp;All are exclusive to this set. You have Jay and Lloyd in the kneepad outfit, and Kapua&#39;rai who has a tail and is exclusive. You also get Master Chen and Zugu.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was interesting and took me about two hours. However, since I was building on carpet when I got to the upper level and pushed down hard, the lower level collapsed. This made the build longer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is nice. The only thing I think lego should have added was more studs on the back of the temple. It is very hard to fit a guy next to the treasure chest.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this set was very nice, but it could have been a little better.</p>
