<p>Parts/box</p>

<p>I found the parts in this set to be very common LEGO pieces which is very disappointing because it costs a lot of money. The box is huge for the actual size of the set and is huge!</p>

<p>Mini figures</p>

<p>A lot of mini figures, I think there should be more but they didn&#39;t want to add more.</p>

<p>Nya; 7.5/10 cool figure</p>

<p>Kai: 6/10 boring figure he comes in nearly&nbsp;all the sets</p>

<p>lloyd Garmadon: 7/10 adequate figure</p>

<p>purple snake: 7:10 could be improved</p>

<p>Snake solider: 6.9/10 Can add to snake army</p>

<p>White snake: 8/10 best figure</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>Good set has a nice truck and is adequate mini figures 8/10</p>

"Silvereye32","2015-10-17T19:02:56.72Z","Review: 70750 Ninja DBX","<p>In this review, I will be writing about 70750 Ninja DBX. The &quot;Ninja DBX&quot;&nbsp;is the largest of the sets released in the first wave of ninjago sets. The DBX also made a few appearances&nbsp;in the animated show &quot;Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu&quot; .</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>The box is a larger size, due to the large size of the set itself.</p>

<p>On the rear side of the box, it shows how the rear part of the truck can come off, and other functions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most the pieces from this set are common and you can find them in other sets.</p>

<p>The part list can be found here:</p>

<p>http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=70750-1</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The names of the minifigures are the following: Ruto (The robot), Nya (the Samurai), Garmadon (The older man), Kai (The ninja of fire), Pythor (The white Anacondrai&nbsp;serpent), Chop&#39;Rai&nbsp;(The purple Anacondrai serpent)&nbsp;and Kapau (The Anacondrai&nbsp;cutlass).<br />
<br />
The minifigure&nbsp;&quot;Ruto&quot; is a good minifigure, he is not made out of usual&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;pieces, therefore, unlike other minifigures.</p>

<p>The nya figure was one of the better ones included in this set, but this variant is not very rare, for she is included in quite a few other sets. &nbsp;Her variant&nbsp;is a step up from the previous&nbsp;versions&nbsp;(2012, 2104), this time, having more of a detailed torso and&nbsp;dark green coloring.&nbsp;Nya comes with a new double sided head, this time coming with the samurai goggle printing.</p>

<p>The Garmadon minifigure&nbsp;is exclusive to set.&nbsp;This minifigure&nbsp;is the second variant of Sensei Garmadon, this time in his &quot;Tournament&nbsp;Robes&quot;.&nbsp;On the front&nbsp;it shows his face (one sided head) and his black robe, which has white sleeves and gold lettering. on the back, it shows his robe torn, revealing the anacondrai&nbsp;tattoo on his back.</p>

<p>Kai, the ninja of fire. This minifigure is his zukin variant, the tenth version of him to be made. unlike the other zukin ninja, he comes in more than one set, so he isn&#39;t as&nbsp;sought after. on the front he has a red,&nbsp;ninja mask, with lettering on the forehead. His gi has brown armor-like markings, knee pads, and a crimson colored&nbsp;belt. on the back he is wearing a sword holder that is similar to a backpack. When the back back is removed, more brown armor is visible.</p>

<p>One of the more interesting minifigures has got to be the new pythor variant. He is white with purple markings along his head, front and back of torso, and the front of his tail piece. his jaw is fully opened, reveling his teeth. he has red armor markings on the front and back of his torso.<br />
Pythor&nbsp;has also faced some major changes from his last variant. The most noticeable is the color change. He is now white with purple markings, while the past variant was purple with black. The new variant also has larger eyes, and a larger gem marking on his forehead. There is also a &nbsp;less noticeable change, his head mold was altered so his head&nbsp;is slightly pushed out more, away from his torso, allowing him to wear Anacondrai Armor, something his past variant&nbsp;couldn&#39;t do. The older variant also didn&#39;t have armor markings like the new pythor.</p>

<p>Chop&#39;rai&nbsp;is chope&nbsp;in his anacondrai form.&nbsp;Chop&#39;rai&nbsp;may&nbsp;not be exclusive to this set, but&nbsp;is&nbsp;a nice&nbsp;minifigure.&nbsp;His head is custom,&nbsp;made especially for the anacondrai minifigures. He has anacondrai armor, which is strange, because pre-anacondrai&nbsp;chope did&nbsp;not have anacondrai armor. he also has a serpent tail piece instead of legs, similar to pythor, but his is in purple. Chop&#39;rai has a detailed scale print on the front and back of his torso. The middle scales on his torso are a bronze color on the front, but purple on the back. The top part of his&nbsp;tail piece shows part of his&nbsp;torn cutlass outfit, and the bottom&nbsp;shows more bronze and purple&nbsp;scales.</p>

<p>Kapau, is the final&nbsp;included with this set. He is one of the six anacondrai cutlasses. He uses a anacondrai skull as a helmet. his face is one sided, has anacondrai tattos and has a phsycotic&nbsp;grin. The front and back of&nbsp;torso shows his left arm and left shoulder covered by armor. he has a anacondrai tatoo on his chest and has standard anacondrai&nbsp;leg and waist pieces.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was not&nbsp;very&nbsp;difficult,&nbsp;</p>

<p>It took me about one and a half hours to complete, but the time it takes really depends on the skill of the builder.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is great! Its a good sized model&nbsp;that&nbsp;measures&nbsp;about&nbsp;9&rdquo; &nbsp;high, 12&rdquo; &nbsp;long and 7&rdquo; &nbsp;wide. It has a nice design, a mixture of Chinese architecture and a large truck. The truck&#39;s detachable&nbsp;rear part that can transform into a command center&nbsp;is one of the more enjoyable parts, with the bike clip, the weapon racks and the computers.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cockpit&nbsp;is designed&nbsp;to fit only two minifigures.&nbsp;The mini flier,&nbsp;serpent gate and real firing laser beams&nbsp;are nice additions&nbsp;too.&nbsp;With all the good&nbsp;things&nbsp;about this model, there is also the bad. The DBX&#39;s&nbsp;deployable command center&nbsp;is a bit&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;to detach, and will break if not carful. The wheel rims also don&#39;t spin along with the wheel.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;overall&nbsp;opinion&nbsp;is,&nbsp;that&nbsp;this&nbsp;set&nbsp;is&nbsp;great.&nbsp;It&nbsp;has&nbsp;a&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;price,&nbsp;great&nbsp;minifigures,&nbsp;a pleasant&nbsp;build, and a great finished model.&nbsp;</p>

"Fauch","2015-11-17T18:55:34.77Z","Impressive looking but fragile","<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set comes with a decent selection of parts, though I&#39;ve seen better in other ninjago sets.</p>

<p>Notable parts would include 6 black radar dish + a 7th printed one. Those 6 huge pieces making the wheels. 6 spinners crowns and 6 sensei wu&#39;s hats. a 2x2x10 (or11?) support tower, a very large canopy piece (same than in benny&#39;s spaceship but different color I think) and some large golden blades.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Enter the serpent had some of the best minifigs I have seen and this set comes slightly under (mainly because master Chen was very good)</p>

<p>All minifigs are highly detailed, they all have prints on legs and on the back of the torso (for some reason garmadon has an anacondrai tatoo on his back) Nya is the only one with double sided face, one side has her normal face without make-up and on the other side she is wearing kind&nbsp;of a robot mask.</p>

<p>The robot has similar articulations to minifigs but hips turn as well. The binoculars can pop out easily.</p>

<p>My 2 other criticisms are that Nya has a titanium metallic armor but her helmet is black and doesn&#39;t match.</p>

<p>Pythor&nbsp;head seems to have a crack, but I have been told it is normal.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not a difficult built, but it is a bit fragile. There is a bit of SNOT and technic which isn&#39;t very complicated. Building the cockpit gets tedious since you need almost 3 full bags before you&#39;re done and progress is very slow.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The result is a huge truck (over 30 cm long, 16 cm large and 13 cm high) with some cool color scheme. It rolls well, the cockpit has 2 seats and 2 computers. The command center on the rear can detach, which basically renders the rear of the truck useless, but allows the deploying of 2 spring loaded shooters hidden in the cockpit (Though I think you shouldn&#39;t have to detach the command center to access them).</p>

<p>The command center has flags opening on the side, but for some reason they aren&#39;t parallel on my model.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff327/Fauch_/DSC04464_zpsckq5n0g4.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 333px;"" /></p>

<p>Inside there are weapons, tools, computers, a place to hold the robot and another for the motorbike. More than half of the space is actually used to store the motorbike. The rear panels can be opened and deployed to form a wall of computers screens with a table. There is also a tower than can be deployed on the top with a little flyer which is meant to be detachable.</p>

<p>My main criticism is that the model lacks sturdiness (well I didn&#39;t get it new, but all pieces seemed in good state and the model is from this year, so I doubt it is because of pieces being worn out)</p>

<p>The cockpit broke once when applying moderately strong pressure on the sides to make sure snot parts were well attached.</p>

<p>The brown assemblies with gold grilles on each side pop out easily.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff327/Fauch_/DSC04463_zps3djiupjf.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 333px;"" /></p>

<p>The floor of the command center is noticeably flimsy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is an ok model, fine for display purpose and with some good playability and great minifigs but it is unlikely to survive some rough play. Value for money is pretty good.</p>
