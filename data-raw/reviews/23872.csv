It is color full, has great parts and excellent mini figures and offers great playability. And very important, especially for the kids, the set is affordable. Lego has turned into the right direction here since this set and other Ninjago sets are attractive for both kids and AFOL&#39;s too.</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks</strong> : Not a great challenge of course but fun to built this small set. It has a hidden Sword trap to defend the Jade Sword in the back, works simple but effective.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : The parts are the biggest pro for this set starting with the minifigures : a great looking <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/njo117/Kai-Sleeveless"">Kai with hair piece </a>and the Anacondrai warrior <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/njo120/Krait"">Krait</a> I love even more. These new characters are great and not just for the Ninjago theme but also for Castle fans like me. Beside the figures great weapons, leaves and all other bricks are useful too. An overload of compliments here !!</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : My 8 year old kid stole it within 5 minutes and has not stopped playing with it. Two opposite Warriors, a small building with hidden trap and a &quot;special&quot; weapon. Which kid would not love it, bravo Lego !!</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : All of this for a price of &euro; 6.99 so what must I say ... Go and get it for parts, as Army builder or as playset or even better buy multiple !!</p>

"The_Ultimate_TFOL","2015-08-07T18:58:04.153Z","Judge Me by My Size, Do You?","<p>A few days ago I found a giftcard to Barnes and Noble from about three years ago :). I went to the store to find there was just enough left on it to get this set and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70753-1/Lava-Falls"">70753</a>. While the latter&#39;s review is pending, I proudly bring you the Jungle Trap, which is the smallest of the Season 4 Ninjago wave.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty standard, and is almost but not quite a square.The front shows the characters in action while the back shows off the main feature. The instructions are relatively straightforward and are printed on plain beige paper. As far as I could see there weren&#39;t any color discrepancies. In the back there is an ad for the whole wave which oddly excludes the Dojo Showdown.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For a small set, there are some pretty nice parts! Along with two of the new Jade Blade pieces, We get to foliage pieces, one of those great Anacondrai helmets, and a golden katana. The extra pieces are on skeleton leg, one frictionless peg, one of Kai&#39;s masks, a 1x1 cheese slope,&nbsp;a gold lightsaber hilt, and a 1x1 round stud.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>With this set we get one protagonist (Kai) and one antagonist (Krait).</p>

<p>Krait- Krait&nbsp;is one of the Anacondrai cultists. Though I don&#39;t think he makes an appearance in the show, he is still a pretty nice figure. He has nice printing and tattoos running &nbsp;from his chest and down his legs. His face is covered in tattoos and paint and his helmet is amazing!</p>

<p>Kai- Kai is awesome (like usual). His hair is very well molded, and his half-mask is a nice look. Though he a similar mask, hair, and face from the last season, his new gi is really nice. It&#39;s sleeveless with black gloves and has nice printing on the front and back.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The set only has 58 pieces, so the build is short (it took me 4-5 minutes). However, for little kids it&#39;ll be fun to see the build come together. The main play feature is incorporated quite well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model as a whole is pretty small, but you can see what is supposed to happen. Kai and Krait start fighting, and whoever wins goes fr the Jade Blade. They&#39;re walking up the steps when BAM! One of the steps is a trap and two swords come swinging at them. The play feature works well, the harder you hit it the higher the swords will go. The one thing I would&#39;ve liked would&#39;ve been if the tower part in the back was a little more substantial instead of 1x2 bricks on top of each other.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For a set costing $6.99, I think this more than delivers. As impulse buys go, this one is a lot better than many polybags that are only one or two dollars less. It has two minifigures, a play feature, and some nice pieces. Overall, this set is great for its size.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-04T21:26:00.27Z","Unimpressive Trap. Superb Minifigures.","<p><strong>Set #70752 Jungle Trap:</strong> Ninjago is a great Theme when it comes to the larger sets, there&rsquo;s a lot to look forward to. When it comes to these smaller cheap sets I&rsquo;m afraid that not all of them are worth picking up. There are some interesting elements to this set and the Minifigures are a huge draw for such a cheap set. Read on to see my opinions of this set.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: This small set from Ninjago is the first I&rsquo;ve gotten with this particular box design. It&rsquo;s a very interesting design with a red colour and ancient symbols in the background. In the upper corner is Kai&rsquo;s face covered by his full mask, the image of the set on the front shows off the model and the battle to claim the collectible weapon from this wave, there&rsquo;s also a lush jungle in the background with a Serpentine structure in the background on the side.</p>

<p>The back shows the features of the set and includes a miniature checklist for each of the four weapons from this wave, the one included in this set is Number 2.</p>

<p>Instructions: The manual is short and to the point, showcasing the build, which is extremely minimal due to the small number of pieces in this set, for a boxed set it only has 53 pieces, almost Polybag levels of price-per-piece. The final two pages show off the entire wave with all the Ninjago sets dedicated to the Tournament of Elements. It&rsquo;s a great two-page shot for cross-promotions.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The only truly unique parts to this set are the twin blades for Kai&rsquo;s specific weapon, there&rsquo;s also one of the large bones, other than that most of this set can be found quite commonly as far as parts go.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Kai: Wearing what I believe is his Tournament of Elements outfit, Kai has an impressively detailed set of prints. His torso is double-sided with a nice sash and some letters on the front and the symbol associated with Kai on the back and he includes leg printing for his Gi or rather the belt sash and some knee protectors. He includes a lower face mask and for the first time his iconic hair piece design, with a messy head of hair in a nice brown colour.</p>

<p>His face is single sided, the hair piece is made out of a softer plastic, almost rubber and he carries a golden katana, since he&rsquo;s trying to claim the other weapon and his Dragon Sword of Fire has been destroyed at this point in the continuity.</p>

<p>Krait: A member of the Serpentine Cult under Master Chen, Krait is an awesome Minifigure, the printing on his torso is double sided and features serpentine tattoos on a bare torso. His legs are printed with belts on his knees and some great chains and spiked shoes. His weapon is an axe made with a large bone and two axes, and he&rsquo;s wearing the skull of a Serpentine on his head, a great new head piece from this year that really stands out.</p>

<p>His facial printing includes markings for the cult and some evil looking red eyes with a scar on his lip. A great looking figure.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t much here honestly, it&rsquo;s a rather small model and so the build is quick and easy. There are no difficult steps, in all honesty I&rsquo;m not entirely sure this set is really needed unless the weapon is unique to this set. Er, but I digress, the build can be finished in under twenty minutes.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s called the Jungle Trap and for a good reason, a tiny shrine sits on a raised set of stairs, hidden behind the large fronds is a pair of scimitars, apply enough pressure to the topmost stair and bam, instant Ninja shish-kebob. As far as models go it isn&rsquo;t bad, but the fact that you&rsquo;re asked to pay ten dollars for something that could easily be built using existing parts from your collection is a bit of a downer. Also the play feature requires a lot of pressure to actually work, you have to slam your finger, or Minifigure down pretty hard to trigger it. Could definitely stand a bit better execution.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>What really sells this set for me are the pair of Minifigures and the unique weapon from this sub-theme of Ninjago. It&rsquo;s a cheap method of getting both, unfortunately the fact that the model only has 53 pieces is a huge hit when it comes to price-per-piece ratios. Unless you&rsquo;re able to get this on clearance, as I did, I think it&rsquo;s safe to skip in favor of the larger, more impressive Ninjago sets.</p>

"vikings","2017-03-11T23:33:59.83Z","Bigger than I thought it was going to be. ","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong>The Jungle Trap comes in a tiny box (about as small as they can get). The dimensions of the box are 14.1x12.2x4.6 cm and weighs 0.08 kg (0.18 lbs). The instructions were bigger than I thought they would be for such a small set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong>This set has a total of 58 pieces. There are some interesting parts in this from the jade blades to the leafs. The &nbsp;Jade blades are used for the first time in this wave and are a neat piece to get. The leafs add a nice bit of detail to the set as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong>&nbsp;This set has two minifgs. You get Kai (Jungle version) and Krait. Kai comes with a gold ninja sword and has the ninja mask as well. Krait has a double bladed axe. He has a lot of body prints as well as a nice anacondrai&nbsp;helmet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>The build was not hard at all it was very easy. It took me under 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong>When the set is finished it was a nice little set. It was bigger than I thought it would be. Both figures fit the set well. There is a lot of play ability in the set. The leafs hide two hidden swords that come up to defend the jade blade.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong>My overall opinion on this set is that they did a good job on such a small set. It was bigger than I thought it was going to be. The figures fit the set well and the play ability is good for the size of the set. My overall opinion of this set is a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"CC_2224","2017-07-15T05:20:53.857Z","An inexpensive, fun playset - though the minifigures take center stage","<p>The build of the set has nice detail and limited posability with the foliage and&nbsp;it holds the collectable dual Jade Blade. The function is very well done and creative. When you push the 1x2 reddish-brown tile with some force, the anacondrai dark blades come together to hit or &#39;squash&#39; a minifigure.</p>

<p>The sets parts are nice, and Lego didn&#39;t cheap out on the selection. Two Jade Blades is generous for a set under $10 in the US and Canada. Both figures get a weapon, a pearl gold sword for Kai, and a double bladed bone axe for Krait.</p>

<p>The minifigures themselves are great, for a small set two figures is a lot. Krait has detailed printing on the front and back as well as an intricately moulded headpiece. Kai has his rebooted hair, face, and half mask. As well as his new sleeveless tournament outfit, which has detailed printing, and his respective symbols.</p>

<p>The building experience was short and enjoyable and can serve&nbsp;as a warm up for building bigger sets. It is playable and one could use the scenery as a trap or a battleground. The highlight of the set is actually the price. $7 USD is a small amount to pay for two figures and a structure. It hasn&#39;t appreciated much since its retirement, and if it is in a Bricklink&nbsp;store or on Amazon / Ebay I strongly recommend any Ninjago fan to pick it up.</p>
