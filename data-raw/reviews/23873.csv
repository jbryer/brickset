I thought this wave could be a way to connect with my old favorite. What draws people to this set is probably the function of the collapsing bridge, or getting Cole for a very cheap price.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>This set&nbsp;comes with the small box that&#39;s a little larger than the Jungle Trap box. The green ninja&#39;s face has been replaced with the classic red and in the background at the top of the box, you can see the Anacondrai&nbsp;symbols.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The set comes with a couple of technic pieces, but the main draw will be the very large flames, the tank tracks used for the bridge and the jade blade. Sleven&#39;s&nbsp;sword is also in the new beige color.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>?Cole is in his new Tournement of Elements gear and I think it&#39;s great that his hair piece is included. Sleven&nbsp;is one of the Anacondrai&nbsp;cultists and his torso printing makes him a little different from the others in other sets. However, his head piece is fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build is nothing special but just something you would expect from a &pound;7.99 set. You build two small rock mounds, the bridge, then a small shrine where the jade blade is.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The complete model is nothing really to look at, but you can reach some very cool poses with the figures on the bridge.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>A very nice little set with&nbsp;some great pieces and figures. My next ninjago set is already on it&#39;s way, and it&#39;s good to have another theme I like apart from the over priced, generic Star Wars theme. My poor wallet.</p>

"CC_2224","2017-07-15T05:40:49.137Z","Another affordable tournament set with strong minifigures","<p>The build is actually more fun than I&nbsp;expected. There are countless ways to pose and place your figures for battle. It looks cool,&nbsp;compact, and can be easily expanded on. The Jade Blade scythe looks perfect at the raised end which leaves room for interpretation and adventure. The big function of the model is to pull the bridge down and make the minifigures fall into the hot lava.</p>

<p>The parts in this set have a lot of variety, and the greebling and little details complete the set. The large flame pieces add to the size and threat of the fires below. The weapons are nice too, you get a pearl gold staff, a three piece blade that looks menacing, as well as the collectable Jade Blade scythe.</p>

<p>The minifigures are great, especially for a set under $10 ($10 in Canada). Sleven has the nice Anacondrai headgear, and exclusive printing on the legs, head, and torso. Cole has his rebooted head, hair, and face mask as well as his tournament robes with nice detail and appropriate printing to his character.</p>

<p>The building experience was fun and shorter than most other sets. As usual with Lego: I have nothing to complain about the building experience. The set is playable for battles, quests, and traps, although the theme is a bit dark for younger children. The price is great and not worth passing up, it hasn&#39;t appreciated greatly, so I&#39;d recommend getting it:&nbsp;espedially if you want Tournament Cole.</p>

"Hashem1983","2017-09-05T11:09:21.467Z","Surprisingly Wonderful","<p>For starter, this is my first Ninjago Set I have ever bought, yet I did have a good look of all the Ninjago&nbsp;sets from the beginning, and I got to say that I was impressed by almost each set.&nbsp; I bought this set online back in 2015 but I was lazy to review it.</p>

<p>Though the set is small, but sometimes the small sets could have a great impression on you, the building experience for a small set is wonderful, I liked how the rocky stairs are built and how the other side of the bridge being built where there is the&nbsp;jade blade, you could say a small rocky pit with lava and fire underneath, there is also a nice mechanism for the bridge to collapse and that is there is a long technic axle&nbsp;under it, and by pulling the red axle back makes the bridge falls down, and by pushing it forward it pulls the bride back up.</p>

<p>You get 2 minifigures&nbsp;in this set:</p>

<p>Cole &quot;Sleeveless&quot;: wearing black ninja outfit, the Torso has&nbsp;Japanese calligraphy on the lapel and there is printings on the back.&nbsp;His legs are black with prints on it to continue the top part of the torso. He also gets a black ninja mask that covers the mouth, and a black hair piece. Although his mouth is covered with the mask, he has some seriousness look.</p>

<p>Sleven: this is the coolest figure in this set, his torso is shirtless and has tattoo snakes on his chest that continues to his back, he is also wearing&nbsp;a belt on his waist with snake heads as a buckle. His legs are in purple and have nice detailed prints on it. As for the head, he has an angry looking face with tattoo snakes on the side of his face and wears&nbsp;a snake head helmet, I got to say that is a very interesting piece to have.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, even though I am not that familiar with the theme but little, I still see it a very good set with very great parts, an excellent build and has nice figures.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-08T19:16:48.663Z","My favorite function!","<p>Lego set#70753 is the perfect addition to any Ninjago collection.</p>

<p>The set includes 94 pieces. Of those 94 you can build to Minifigures; tournament of elements Cole, and Sleven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set itself is very fun equipped with some slanted rocky surfaces, a jade blade, and a fun function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The function is the falling bridge. You can activate it simply by pulling back on the technic axle found at the back. With this you can send Cole plumiting to his doom. This function has to be one of my favorites.</p>

<p>overall i really love this set and would praise this set to anyone who is an avid Ninjago collector or somebody who loves fun functional builds</p>
