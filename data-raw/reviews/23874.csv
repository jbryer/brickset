<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is 2015 version, Ninjago is now in red as the main category color. &nbsp;Really makes the set(s) stand out on the shelf as compared to the old white version. &nbsp;This is my first Ninjago set aside from a promotional polybag here or there.</p>

<h3>Parts &nbsp;</h3>

<p>The parts, for the most part are a selection of blue, black, light and dark bluish gray, &nbsp;The blue are mostly there for appearance, including the fingers on one side. &nbsp;The accents of gold are very nice, the really stand out, compliment the model and have mechanical effects where the back four swords, open and close like wings!</p>

<p>The sticker set contains six, for the 2 gold wedge circles, and as highlights to blue on the arms and feet. &nbsp;No sticker fan but not so pad.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 &nbsp;One is the bandana wearing &quot;Day&quot;, controller/rider of the Mech. &nbsp;Next is the lizard skull wearing &quot;Chope&quot;. &nbsp;Chope has nice detailing and looks cool when the Mech&nbsp;is posed with him airborne in the Mechs&#39; fingers! &nbsp;Both are very well suited for the model.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really interesting. &nbsp;Having just built the Exosuit, the moving of the back four swords/wings was a nice surprise. &nbsp;At $14.99 I wasn&#39;t expecting to be surprised with mid complexity mechanics. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very nice, again, for $14.99 I wasn&#39;t expecting to be blown away... and while I was not blown away, this was a very nice triple, just shy of a total home run!! &nbsp;The flexibility of the Mech is outstanding! &nbsp;The two hands are playable, one with built in 1x1 round plate flickers and the other hand contains three digits to grasp for items/minifigures.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Honestly, for the 2015 wave of new Lego sets, this is a must-have set in the category of $14.99 and less. &nbsp;If you can get it on sale, bonus! &nbsp;Really a great model! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Just what I needed, a new category to start liking, lol!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, I say we start the review. I apologize with the long introduction, but I felt it needed to be addressed. This set comes with two great figures: Jay and Chope, the Anacondrai Warrior. Chope may be cool, but comes with poor defenses against Jay&#39;s mech in this set. He has a nice spear, and a bow cannon, which is practically useless against metal. Jay, on the other hand, has the massive mech, which comes equipped with a hand, studs shooter, and intense blade flip-out in the back! However, the arms do not stay on well, and my model kept falling apart! Still, it makes up for that with the wicked Jade Blade.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s all folks. PLEASE GIVE POSITIVE FEEDBACK I AM SICK OF THE NEGATIVITY LEFT BY YOU PEOPLE BECAUSE OF MY REVIEWS!! &gt;:(</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2016-09-21T23:52:16.72Z","Your impending  doom lies above you!","<p>Hi it&#39;s Ninja again. I figured I&#39;d update you with another review. I found this mech lying in my room one day and then I realized how awesome it is. Let&#39;s dive into the review.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>The box is pretty typical for a Ninjago set of it&#39;s size. It shows the product dueling a Anacondrai&nbsp;worshiper and a wimpy little crossbow. In the background&nbsp;is some beautiful scenery. On the back, it shows the multiple action features and some little scenes to act out. The instructions are pretty easy to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>The parts seem very common, as there are pieces in multiple shades of blue. I&#39;ll guess the hand pieces are a nice recolor. I also like the stud shooter in pieces. I also think the base&nbsp;plate for the crossbow is&nbsp;pretty rare. I also think the white pole and white lightsaber hilt are rare. I think the gold lightsaber hilt and the jade blade piece are also rare. Also the spike in this color is new to me. Lastly, the helmets of the Anacondrai worshippers are rare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>For once, I feel the&nbsp;figures are a bit generic. I like the figures, but I feel it was the mech&nbsp;that attracted me to the set. You have Jay in his Tournament&nbsp;of the Elements attire. You also get Chope( the Anacondrai worshiper figure I keep mentioning). He seems kind of like the other worshippers with subtle details to differ him from the rest.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>The build is easy, depending on you age. This is a cheap set, so you shouldn&#39;t have too much difficulty with it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>The completed model is great. The crossbow can turn up and down. The mech actually has a lot of poseabilty, which is something I admire in Lego mechs. You can put the mechs in various positions and still be stable. You can fire the stud shooters. Lastly, you can fold up or down the huge blade pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I think the set is worth it. For once I say this, the mech alone is worth it. I do appreciate the minifigures and the crossbow though. I highly recommend it to you, despite your age, as it makes a good collector&#39;s and a children&#39;s item.&nbsp;</p>
