<p><em>Well it seems like the&nbsp;Ninjago theme has made a triumphant return this year.&nbsp;So, does this set 70755 really worth the moneys in your pocket? Read this review to find out!</em></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is rather small,&nbsp;as compared&nbsp;with&nbsp;other sets that have the same price and age range.&nbsp;The back of the box feature all of the playability of the set itself. What I really like is the continuation of collectible minifigures&#39; weapons, this time around are the &#39;Jade blades&#39; (although the ninjas never used them for combat in the TV show). This set includes the 4th Jade blade.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>?The set has 2 minifigures: Tournament robes Lloyd&nbsp;and Kapau. Tournament robes&nbsp;Lloyd is exclusive to this set. While Kapau&nbsp;also appear in set number 70750. Both are&nbsp;decent looking figures.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Me personally, I like the Tournament robes much much more than the Zukin robes (Just a personal opinion)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite easy but some steps requires perfection. And putting the wheels&nbsp;to the tires&nbsp;are just a pain to me. That is all I could say about the build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The small tower is probably a thing they put in the set to set up some scenario. But it&nbsp;quite nice, it has the tan&nbsp;-purple color scheme going around it. And also a holder&nbsp;for you to place the Jade blade.</p>

<p>While the Jungle Raider itself looks like a big buggy type of vehicle. All of it&#39;s&nbsp;four wheels&nbsp;having gold spikes sticking out toward the edges. In the front we have two spring-loaded shooters, which are very strong projectiles. And at the back we have a holder&nbsp;to hold Lloyd&#39;s golden katana, and it&#39;s&nbsp;also has a little bit of suspension.&nbsp;The vehicle&nbsp;has a very nice Dark green and Gold color scheme all over it, but the Blue and Red of some technic pins totally breaks it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Overall I think this is a fairly nice $20 set. You have 2 minifigures (1 is exclusive), 1 small tower and 1 big buggy (that has a lot of playability). So what&nbsp;I see here is&nbsp;that you are having a pretty nice deal here. And if you are a serious Ninjago fan, I&#39;m definitely recommending this set to you.</p>

"rinaldo","2015-12-16T00:25:10.157Z","A very nice rider with low price","<p>The set &nbsp;<b>Lego Ninjago 70755</b>&nbsp;proposes the episode where&nbsp;<b>Kapau</b>&nbsp;has chained the&nbsp;<b>Jade </b><b>Blade</b>to a stone column in the jungle and he is guarding.&nbsp;<b>Lloyd</b>&nbsp;with his&nbsp;<b>Gungle Raider</b>&nbsp;with full suspension and larger tires go into the jungle to the reconquest of the precious blade.</p>

<p>https://www.flickr.com/photos/rinaldofr/23777373805/in/dateposted-public/</p>

<p>Set&nbsp;<b>70755</b>&nbsp;will come in a box of small-medium size and consists of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Raiders of the jungle</li>
	<li>Stone column with the blade attached Jade</li>
	<li>Two minifigs: Kapau and Lloyd uncapped and sleeveless shirt</li>
</ul>

<p>It is aimed at an audience of at least seven years, but in this case I think we can safely say that even children with a year less and sufficient experience with&nbsp;<b>LEGO</b>&nbsp;bricks are able peacefully to assemble and play.</p>

<p>Opening the package there are two envelopes containing bricks and some large pieces unwrapped, in this case, reading the instructions, it is recommended to open both envelopes and to unite all bricks before starting assembly the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It starts from the two minifigs Lloyd and Kapau, and continue assembling without any problem the stone column with Jade Blade, after that starts the construction of the Lloyd Gungle Raider.</p>

<p>In this case the assembly starts with the top of the raider, that is made with few pieces of&nbsp;<b>LEGO TECHNIC</b>&nbsp;and presents no difficulty making easy the assembly of the cookpit except for the rollbar of the driver and the eject mechanism of the two fronts lances who requires greater attention to be mounted properly.</p>

<p>Over the top, you go to the bottom, that is composed with a lot of pieces from LEGO Technic that are used for the leaf spring suspension and wheel axles and requires some extra care, but nothing impossible.</p>

<p>After completing the assembly I consider it useful to point out:</p>

<p><b>PRO</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Design captivates</li>
	<li>Ejection system spears front</li>
	<li>Lloyd</li>
</ul>

<p><b>AGAINST</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Rollbar inaccurate and unstable</li>
	<li>Lame Front-side Raider unstable</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p>The set&nbsp;<b>70755</b>&nbsp;has no innovative solution in the Lego Ninjago world, but it is very attractive for raider design; furthermore, the presence of Lloyd and the relatively low list price (&euro; 19.99) make it a very interesting and recommended for a gift</p>

<p><b>Overall evaluation</b></p>

<p>Good</p>
