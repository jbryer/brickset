<p>One of the most popular 2015 TECHNIC sets so far, this was backordered 3 times in a month, so I was especially glad to find this under the tree this year.</p>

<p>This is obviously based on a CAT loader (Picture <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=CAT+Loader&amp;rlz=1C1AFAB_enUS573US573&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=899&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cDynVPG0EoWfgwST64CwCA&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ#tbm=isch&amp;q=CAT+Compact+Loader&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=o-NsHUtLRBrBrM%253A%3B2ZAPxH3piFQi6M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fwww.walker-cat.com%252Fsystem%252Fimages%252FBAhbB1sHOgZmIiQyMDExLzAzLzAxLzA4LzMzLzMyLzYzMy9DQ0UuanBnWwg6BnA6CnRodW1iIg0zNjB4MzYwPg%252FCCE.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Ftuningpp.com%252F246c-256c-262c-and-272c-skid-steer-loaders%252Fmodelbarn.co.nz*images*CAT-299C-NSCT55226.jpg%252Fceyaygr.girlshopes.com*caterpillar272ctracks%252F%3B360%3B270"">here</a>), albeit with a different, better, color scheme.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a nice selection of parts here, including 64 small track links and the bucket, which only comes in three sets so far - #42023-1, 42004-1, and this. there are also two of <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6073231"">these</a>, which are one of the most useful new pieces LEGO&#39;s released in the past year.</p>

<p>Not to mention two of <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6093833"">these</a>, which are&nbsp;brand new in&nbsp;orange and only appear in #42038-1 and this.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is extremely playable, and contains the following functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The lever on the right side of the vehicle opens and closes the bars above the bucket</li>
	<li>The lever on the left side of the vehicle tips the bucket</li>
	<li>And the gear on the back raises and lowers the bucket</li>
</ul>

<p>The bars above the bucket hold objects&nbsp;inside the bucket, and it works, too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The secondary model</h3>

<p>The secondary model is a snow groomer, with a raising/lowering plow (Via a knob on the top of the vehicle)&nbsp;and an easily positionable crane arm. You can raise the crane arm with a knob on the side, and position the upper part of the arm with a lever situated there. There is a hook on the end of the arm, which is perfect for picking up the bucket used in the first model (And not in this one).</p>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that the tracks roll considerably better on this model than on the compact loader.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set overall, and I think it&#39;s well worth the money.</p>

"Bering","2015-08-24T19:15:27.507Z","A great set for a small price!","<p>I bought this one for only 12 euro&#39;s. Although it has &quot;only&quot; 252 parts, the building experience is very good and challenging. The set has nice colours and the functions work very well. Lots of Technic fun in such a small package. Well done Lego! The B-model is also very nice, although it has less functions than the main model.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend this set. I liked it so much i bought a second one. :-)</p>

"martiniman","2016-01-13T15:52:11.45Z","Best Technic set of 2015!","<p>This thing is the best Technic Set of 2015! I also bought the Arocs, crazy cool machine with awesome new pneumatics, but it also puts a hole in your wallet. This is everything Technic should be: fantastic looking, great functionality, great bang for the buck!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small, yet it contains the king of 2015! There is a lot of stuff for your money. Hey, this creeper is only 13&euro;! Even the bucket is cool for that little money!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Usually for 13 bucks you get a pile of boring standard pieces. Not this time.</p>

<ul>
	<li>2 big orange 5x11 liftarms</li>
	<li>14 gears</li>
	<li>Tracks</li>
	<li>white beams</li>
	<li>dark blue grey curved liftarms</li>
	<li>worm (we love worms!)</li>
	<li>exhaust pipe</li>
	<li>bucket</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This one loves to lift minifigures!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Great build. Lego managed to put 3 functions in to this little bastard! Nothing repetive.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This baby rocks. It can lift the bucket to insanely big heights. Very accurate for a bob-cat like loader. The two simple but effective levers allow enough tipping range in both top and bottom position, and you can cover the bucket in a realistic way. The tracks roll smooth.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>2 Words describe it all: THE BEST. This is the best Technic set LEGO made for 2015. Did I mention it looks super cool, it is cheap (as in the price of 1 Tumbler wheel!), it give lot of fun to build and to play.... I just go and buy 3 more for as long as it is in stores....</p>

<p>Oh, and it is also THE BEST birthday presents for little kids that like technic/LEGO and dads with kids. Cheap and certainly bringing on a smile!</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-10-14T21:23:53.33Z","Not a Technic fan, but this is brilliant!","<p>Hello, Bricksetters! It&#39;s PicnicBasketSam yet again, reviewing yet another set that his little brother got for his birthday. This one just came yesterday, and it is very fun to build and play with, it&#39;s like a small Tonka truck in that regard. Still waiting on the mini cherry picker though...</p>

<p>THE BOX<br />
The box is really small, but packed full of bags. There&#39;s a tiny sticker sheet, two instruction booklets, and three bags of parts. One of them is mostly just tread links, which I will get to in a minute.</p>

<p>THE INSTRUCTIONS<br />
They are&nbsp;just about what one would expect, although the lack of outlining on the black parts puzzles and bothers me.</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGS<br />
There are none. But... it might be the perfect size to fit a Technic figure into.</p>

<p>THE PARTS<br />
252 of them. Now I don&#39;t build Technic much, and I certainly don&#39;t build Technic MOCs, but there&#39;s nothing here that couldn&#39;t be integrated into a System model. The bucket feels cheap, but does the job, and I really like the looser, more adjustable tread links. Note that very few of these parts are orange, blue, or white. With Technic, a little bit of a color goes a very long way.</p>

<p>THE BUILD<br />
It&#39;s not terribly complex. Took my younger brother and I about an hour, which is pleasingly long for a set of this size. It starts with half of the chassis, then a little gear mechanism, and then the other half, onto which is added the cockpit, the boom, and then the treads. These treads are actually just like the mini treads, but have a wider base.</p>

<p>THE COMPLETED MODEL<br />
I have yet to build the Snow Groomer alternate model. But the Bobcat main model is a beaut. It&#39;s small, rolls brilliantly on carpet, and is densely packed with functions, of which there are three:</p>

<p>-Turning a knob on the back to raise and lower the boom. That knob is attached to a worm gear, which in turn rotates a 24 tooth gear onto which the boom is mounted.<br />
-Turning the left lever to open and close the grabber thing. This just pulls a liftarm back, and yanks the grabber with it.<br />
-Turning the right lever to raise and lower the bucket itself.This only really works the boom lifted, and it also raises the grabber. Turning both levers at once will move the entire assembly around.</p>

<p>And it is really fun to play with. It doesn&#39;t roll well on hard surfaces, though, and&nbsp;it&#39;s really hard to actually... scoop... anything with just by pushing the vehicle into something. But these are really minor complaints.</p>

<p>OVERALL OPINION<br />
This is one of my favorite Technic sets. Cheap, incredibly fun to play with, small, and snappy. If you haven&#39;t, go pick one up at Target, TRU, or online now!</p>

"Alonzo_Brickovsky","2015-09-19T11:12:53.487Z","Smart build, lots of fun, ugly bucket","<p>My choice for this set was determined by three things:</p>

<p>1. I was flat broke after buying two 2500-part sets and only had 15&euro;;</p>

<p>2. I wanted the longest build I could get - and this means any minifigure sets were out of the question;</p>

<p>3. I never had any tracked vehicle, nor with bucket for that matter (in fact I prefer &quot;studded&quot; sets).</p>

<p>The compact tracked loader is great value for money with 250 parts, even if 50 of them are tracks only. The build took me two hours at leasurely pace. The finished model looks larger and 10x better than on pictures!&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/569/21921875465_58d2eb12f9_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;519&quot; height=&quot;640&quot;"" style=""width: 519px; height: 640px;"" /></p>

<p>Three main functions work fine, it&#39;s a lot of fun, and you can place minifig inside ;)</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5745/21300760163_5a3711ec44_z.jpg&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;523&quot;"" style=""width: 640px; height: 523px;"" /></p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have complaints. In fact I only have one: the bucket looks AWFUL. It looks like it&#39;s made by &#39;other company&#39;! The plastic feels really cheap, the lines are irregular and the inside is not entirely black like it should have been. Especially when compared to all other parts, which are of superb quality.</p>

<p>I may be picky sometimes, but let&#39;s keep in mind that Lego is not only a toy for children; it&#39;s also a display model for AFOLs. That&#39;s why we pay for it 1/2 more than we would for other producers&#39; toys.&nbsp;</p>

"r12ax7","2016-10-14T16:07:42.95Z","Best Playability from a Small Technic Set Ever","<p>This set gives you the best bang for your buck of any Technic set I have ever built - if you don&#39;t already have this set and are a fan of Technic, go buy it right now - you should be able to get it for under $15.00! &nbsp;</p>

<p>Having recently come out of my Dark Ages, I immediately was drawn to the flagship sets like 42030 and 42043. &nbsp;Since my wife will kill me if she sees any more of these massive sets around, I started looking at some of the smaller sets I may have glossed over. &nbsp;Based on martiniman&#39;s review,&nbsp;I decided to give this set a go.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing special here. &nbsp;Small box, as I recall with the &quot;thumb press&quot; as opposed to tape sealed. &nbsp;For me that is actually a plus as my son likes opening these boxes. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I actually disagree with Alonzo Brickovsky&#39;s comment RE the bucket. &nbsp;Certainly its not the impressive 42030 bucket, or quite as large as the 8043/8069/8265 version, but it is the same bucket used in 42004, 42023 and those are larger scale back-hoes/loaders than this little skid steer loader and I actually think it looks and works great and in proportion.</p>

<p>Nothing else especially rare or interesting. &nbsp;The orange double bent arms were a part I had not seen in the plastic before and I feel like we don&#39;t get as many white lift arms as you might expect. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was not especially intricate. &nbsp;I like how the L with quarter ellipse half-liftarms formed the rear of the model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks exactly like the little skid steer loaders used in my area for snow removal or landscaping duty.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The key with this set is the playability. &nbsp;It take a little getting used to but the way the functions are integrated is perfect. &nbsp;Grab one of the axle-handles on each side with your hands and you basically have complete control to lift the bucket, dump the bucket and control the spill guard like its a T-Rex chomping into the dirt. &nbsp;My 4 year old made quick work of a pile of bricks loading them into the back of the 42023 dump truck. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It is an oddly satisfying motion - i actually find it more enjoyable than the 42030 and 42043 (sort of). &nbsp;</p>
