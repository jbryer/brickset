I bought it because I bought myself the 42009 Mobile Crane MkII, and knew my 3 year old son would want to play with it but it wouldn&#39;t be suitable to let him play with alone. So I got this truck because it looked robust and fun and suitable for him to play with. He helped me build it by finding parts and offering useful advice.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a simple box with no display window and you have to break a perforated tab to get it open. It&#39;s hardly a display item anyway, so not really a problem!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with some nice wheels and a single cylinder engine, and enough parts to make simple vehicles with steering.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><br />
None, and the scale is incorrect to fit a small lego minifig.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a really straightforwards build with only a couple of places you have to pay attention. It would be an ideal first Technic set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Truck is robust. The moving engine piston, along with the chain drive adds another mechanism and point of interest. The steering system makes it really fun to play with and the dump mechanism is simple but nicely executed. There are just a couple of nice cosmetic details that really help it look the part - the exhaust and air filter. As I hoped, it&#39;s a great toy for my 3 year old son to play with (supervised) and he&#39;s now nagging me to build the second model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Does exactly what it says on the box. This would be an ideal introduction to the world of Technical Lego in my opinion, and I&#39;d have no problem letting kids 6 and up build it with a bit of help. They can also use the bits in the box to make other trucks, cars, go-karts and all manner of other vehicles.</p>
