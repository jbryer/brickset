"Duq","2015-01-28T01:18:35.32Z","Nice engine, disappointing model","<p>I&#39;m a biker who owns most of the Technic Motorbike sets so this one was high on my shopping list for this year. The initial pictures looked interesting; a bit more fairing than 2010&#39;s street bike and a new colour for Technic.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box is a bit empty. It&#39;s the first Technic box I&#39;ve seen in a long time without an &#39;inset&#39; picture that shows dimensions or play functions. Just a picture of the bike on a dark road. The back of the box shows the alternative model and here there are two smaller photos showing the moving pistons.</p>

<p>There are two instruction books, one for each model with fairly &#39;slow&#39; instructions; very few parts are added each step.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The most obvious new parts are the medium blue panels; 5 pairs in 3 different sizes. It&#39;s a nice colour so I hope there will be more Technic parts in this colour in future. Then there&#39;s the usual suspects for a motorbike; the front fork shock absorbers, a single shock absorber for the rear, cylinder blocks and pistons, 4 this time, two nice big wheels, same size unfortunately; no fat rear tyre like we had on #8420.</p>

<p>An interesting new part is design id 18654. The Lego inventory calls it a beam 1x1 but it&#39;s more like half a pin connector. It&#39;s a 1 brick wide stud reverser that I&#39;m sure is going to be very useful.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is in a nice sequence; you start with a frame, add the rear wheel, then literally hang an engine in the frame. This is a really clever construction. Next you put the front forks on and finally all the fairing parts. With all the angles in this model you need to pay attention but the instructions are clear enough.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>At first glance this is a decent looking road bike. It&#39;s when you look closer that you realise how many details are missing compared to #8051. My review of that set was called &#39;Less is more&#39;. This time I&#39;m afraid less is a lot less; the part count is down by nearly 20% and it shows. The instruments are suggested by two 1x1 round studs. The handle bars have no levers for clutch and brake. There are no footpegs. No mudguards. No brake discs. The exhaust tubes don&#39;t connect to the silencers. The yellow top of the rear shock sits in the middle of the seat which itself is only suggested by two black stickers on the red beams. The designer probably ran out of colour changes so one pair of panels is black, making the bike look awful without stickers.</p>

<p>Like 8420 the engine is a V4, this time mounted like in a Honda VFR, and it&#39;s the highlight of the set. Especially the clever way it hangs in the frame. Overall the bike looks bare and unfinished.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t yet built the B-model but it looks alright on the box; a hard-tail cafe racer with a springer fork. Like the main model though it seems low on details.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s probably clear by now that I&#39;m very disappointed by this set. 8051 was much better than 8420 which itself was a massive improvement over 8430. This is a step backwards. I&#39;m already looking forward to 2020 for the next Technic road bike...</p>

"Freekysch","2015-07-05T12:27:21.71Z","Good Technic Motorcycle set ! I would totally recommend it.","<p>LEGO Technic 42036 is the new brand new motorbike that hit the shelves in 2015. I bought it even if I read some negative reviews online and I must admit that they were wrong. 42036 is a good set for the money you spend on it. It has a good parts assortment and in my opinion a fresh and nice design. Even though it is not as good as 8420 set, I think you should get it !</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The instructions were easy to follow and clear, I have not found any mistakes in them. The color reproduction is ok, so you can&#39;t mistake a color for another. The box is a medium size, and it has some nice graphics on the front.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>At 30 euro, don&#39;t expect much, the parts assortment is decent, you get some nice panels and pieces in light blue color and some flex axles in red. The set has a 4 cylinder engine. You also get 3 suspension parts,&nbsp;&nbsp;and 2 great looking wheels and tires. Also keep in mind that this set has A LOT of stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is easy and relaxing. I build the set in 1 hour and a half, but I did not hurry at all. The outcome is in my opinion great - the motorbike looks very good, it is sturdy and it has some nice details on it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When I look at the finished model I say it is a great one. Again, for the money you pay for the set I think you get a lot. Beside the color scheme - light blue and red, which is unique, you get also some nice wheels, suspension parts and other parts.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite not having the best details, I think this is a good set which comes in a nice color scheme, it has great suspension system, 4 cylinders engine and a nice desing.&nbsp;It looks very nice near 42007 motorbike.&nbsp;</p>

"kendo73","2016-11-26T12:28:17.823Z","good, but could of been better","<p>As a motorcyclist myself, was glad to see another bike to add to my collection, the styling and design is very good, although there are a few area&#39;s that should of been better, I have taken the standard model and added a few additions, fitting of footpegs and levers, adding a better looking / spec exhaust mounted lower and similar to a modern superbike system, also fitting a&nbsp;numberplate holder and front and rear indicators, bodywork wise I have fitted one of the small panels either side under the seat to fill the empty void, and also the stiffer yellow springs to the front.</p>

<p>As I have two of these models, one of which is in a different colour, orange and white with gold wheels and a different style exhaust fitted, I can say that as a set on it&#39;s own it is good, but is very easy to modify to your own taste and syle, not sure on the B model as I have not built that one.</p>

"darkshadow79","2017-01-07T23:21:19.02Z","A fun mid-sized bike","<p>Always a fan Technic motorcycles, the 42036 LT1 delivers. &nbsp;This particular motorcycle comes from a long line of motorcycles produced every few years and in my opinion the best since the eclectic 8420 produced in 2005. &nbsp;So, let&#39;s start with the features. &nbsp;The LT1 features a &nbsp;V-4 engine, which is great for a cycle of this size, and I really enjoy the mini chain links that Lego introduced in 2015 in both the Street Cycle as well as for the drive in the 42035 Mining Truck&#39;s engine, and they work well at joining the engine output to the rear wheel of the cycle. &nbsp;They are a little bit hard on the fingers when joining them, but with any tracked vehicle or the smaller links in this cycle, they can be a pain to join a lot of them at once. &nbsp;But, they fit around the 16-tooth gears perfectly with no slipping on the gear teeth. &nbsp;The large shock absorbers on the front are a welcome addition. &nbsp;I also love the interesting angles that the beams take to from the frame and the body panel fairings that attach finish off the great looks of the LT1. &nbsp;At first I wasn&#39;t crazy about the colour scheme of red and medium blue, but the colours really grew on me and I love the sleek look of the finish fairing panels and flex axles along with the flex hoses used under the seat pointing out the rear are an excellent touch for a cycle at this price point. &nbsp;A very highly recommended set for any motorcycle enthusiast.</p>

"Lty09","2016-12-16T05:34:43.633Z","Not bad at all","<p>Bought two of it mostly for shock absorbers and medium blue parts.</p>

<h2><!--StartFragment--><strong>Building experience</strong><!--EndFragment--></h2>

<p>Both models are quite simple and took me little time to build, but i really liked how B-model uses like half of the parts in set. It maybe not exactly what you would expect, but it&#39;s the part that I enjoyed the most, because parts that left are enough to modify the model, make it look like something completely different without disassembling and rebuild it, just by adding more parts. It was also fun trying to implement rear suspension to the B-model without altering it&#39;s look much, since it doesn&#39;t have one.</p>

<h2><!--StartFragment--><strong>Parts</strong><!--EndFragment--></h2>

<p>There is only 375 parts, but you cant put them in a good use. I found it good source of shock absorbers and it also haves some gears and 30 chain links, which is nice. The red and medium blue color scheme is very cool as well, even though medium blue parts are mostly panels. Wheels are... well just a motorcycle wheels, tires are kinda hard though.</p>

<h2><!--StartFragment--><strong>Playability</strong><!--EndFragment--></h2>

<p>It&#39;s just a display model, but it looks fine and have spinning wheels, working steering and suspension, but the front wheel of A-model <!--StartFragment--><span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span>abuts the fork.</span></span><!--EndFragment--></p>

<h2><!--StartFragment--><strong>Value for money</strong><!--EndFragment--></h2>

<p>The price is ok, but i could be better.</p>

<h2><!--StartFragment--><strong>Overall rating</strong><!--EndFragment--></h2>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a good set with some useful parts and cool color scheme.</p>

"IanC","2017-06-23T17:59:00.087Z","Lovely bike","<p>I&#39;d seen this bike for ages &amp; dismissed it as not looking very interesting. Luckily, it was bought for me as a present or I might never have realised how wrong I was!</p>

<p>The build is pretty straightforward but enjoyable. Rather satisfyingly, the engine block is built as a distinct unit that is then hung inside the frame. Once finished, the model has a really good presence to it - it just looks <em>right</em>. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the way panels are used on some Technic models, but here they create exactly the right lines, and the colour scheme is very well chosen. There are some stickers, but I elected to keep them off&nbsp;and it still looks good.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot I could nitpick here, but really it&#39;s just a lovely looking bike, and a good size too. It&#39;s also practically begging to be customised&nbsp;without feeling incomplete, which I feel is the key to a good Lego model. You could go with anything from a basic colour scheme change, to sticking a fatter rear wheel on, to more technical modifications like repositioning the drivechain. Or you could just put it on a shelf and admire it. Good all round.</p>
