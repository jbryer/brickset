"samalz","2015-02-05T01:22:46.2Z","A marvel and a pleasure","<p>This is the first large technic set I&#39;ve built, and it was a joy from beginning to end. This is a great model.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I built this set slowly, savoring each engineering choice, whirling and twirling every cog and spindle.</p>

<p>The set begins with the front end, which is very densely built. It seems miraculous that some Danish dude dreamed this up without the aid of computer design. To me, it&#39;s that good. (But I am primarily a regular ol&#39; Lego guy, so technic&nbsp;is somewhat new and marvelous to begin with.)</p>

<p>I especially loved the rack and pinion steering and independent suspension. It was cool to be able to show my kids how cars actually work.</p>

<p>There is a really clever use of gearing in the middle of the model, wherein the axles &amp; gears for the steering and driveshaft&nbsp;are interdependent without messing each other up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back end is equally clever, without being a repeat of the front-end suspension. The rear-wheel differential&nbsp;is absolutely beautiful! Such an elegant, simple, terrific invention. It&#39;s great to be able to fiddle with it and just watch how it works.</p>

<p>Also, the instructions were amazingly clear--much better than when I was a kid. (Or am I just better at following instructions as an adult?!)</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Surprisingly large! The wheels and tires are super-sized. It looks like an out-of-the box remote control race&nbsp;car. My kids loved it. You can zoom it around the house and steer it with a little knob on top of the roll cage.</p>

<p>One cool&nbsp;thing&nbsp;about technic I&#39;ve noticed is that the completed models are sturdier than studded Lego sets. Probably someone will overrule me on that, but it&#39;s been my experience so far.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great stuff:</p>

<p>A really fun build. Wonderful design.</p>

<p>Roll cage opens to fit Polly Pockets, GI Joe and other assorted drivers. (Minifigs are too small in scale to be drivers.)</p>

<p>Areas for improvement:</p>

<p>Too expensive, I&#39;d say. The only way it&#39;s&nbsp;worth it is if you tear it down and build your own stuff out of the parts.</p>

<p>Not readily able to drop in a Lego motor.&nbsp;I&#39;m sure some Lego diehards could motorize this buggy with ease, but for me it would take some pretty serious tinkering.</p>

<p>Steering wheel is not connected to the actual steering mechanism.</p>

<p>All in all, really fun!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a medium sized box with perforations to get into it. It actually looks a bit dull and doesn&#39;t do the model justice. There&#39;s a large picture of the A model on the Front, the B model on the back, and very few additional images or feature demonstrations. In the store, it would stay on the shelf... which is a great shame.<br />
<br />
The box contains instructions for both A and B models. There is an error on Page 41 of the A-model build, it only lists half the number of parts you need to complete the step. Other than that they&#39;re great, as always.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is where this kit shines. It has everything you need for mid sized offroaders, with specialist bits that previously you&#39;d need to spend twice as much to get. They&#39;re also all functional, educational parts which copy their real world equivalents. Specifically, you get a Differential cage, an L4 engine,&nbsp; you get a set of independent steerable suspension with&nbsp; hubs, and steering rack and ball joints. Then you get rear suspension, also independent, with hub knuckles as well as a set of CV joints! Note that this is a 2WD model despite looking like a 4x4, it&#39;s like the Customised Pick up in that respect. You also get those awesome balloon off road tyres in a funky green, shock absorbers (pretty firm ones) and a load of bodywork parts. In short, this model is an incredible parts haul at the discounted price it&#39;s available for now and it&#39;s a wonderful basis for vehicle construction.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None!!! But the Old Technic articulated figures almost fit th scale, and can sit in the driving seat.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There is a lot of thought in this build and it flows really nicely. In particular the front sub frame construction is a work of art. There&#39;s also a lot to learn as you build, because you&#39;ll have to work out your own way to use the suspension parts in your MOC&#39;s. The build comes together pretty quickly, around 2-3 hours and there are only a few panels but they absolutely complete the look and feel of this model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Here are some pictures:</p>

<p>What can I say? This model looks great! It steers, has suspension (IMO slightly too firm for the light weight of the model, it works better with the softer shock absorbers), and the Engine is driven through a differential from the rear wheels. I marked it a 4 for playability only because other than an opening canopy it lacks any other functions, but actually, I&#39;m fine with that. It&#39;s robust and very playable, my 3 year old son loves it already. It&#39;s also the first model I&#39;ve felt compelled to sticker up, because it absolutely completes the extreme look.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I cheated a bit with this model: I actually built it almost completely from the online instructions using the parts from the Customised Pick Up before I even owned it. Only the special panels are missing but they do complete the model well. So when I paid &pound;27 on amazon for this set I knew exactly what I was getting and that it was well worth it!<br />
<br />
The parts will go to good use making true 4x4&#39;s, because now I have 2 sets of CV&#39;s and the hubs that accept them, so I can even make Four wheel steered vehicles and 6x6 crawlers and stuff, but the joy of this set is that it gets you everything you need to learn about and build vehicles with advanced, functional suspension systems. A Bargain, and a Great model every technic fan should own.</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2018-11-12T18:01:02.31Z","A Solid Introduction to Car Functionality","<p>Here we were again, a year later after I purchased 42029 Customized Pick-Up Truck, came to my small Technic collection another set which is suspiciously similar to the aforementioned, albeit with a different presentation. This is one of those sets where one might think to themselves &quot;It&#39;s been done countlessly many times before&quot;, but in retrospect certain types of sets need to remain a staple such that younger audiences who haven&#39;t been around as long as I have get the opportunity to experience such sets for the first time.</p>

<p>Build time was not more than 3 hours and we are left with a finished product bursting with light blue and lime green, which certainly make it stand out. The wheel hubs are also lime green which is a rare deviation from the usual white or grey&nbsp;colours. Functions are nothing spectacular from the ordinary and consist of hand-of-god steering, 4-wheel independent suspension, and in-line 4-piston engine powered by the rear wheels with a differential gear. The steering has some backlash but is of little concern. The front suspension is entirely unrestricted in motion and will travel to the fullest extent of the springs, so much so that the front bumper will touch the ground very slightly. The rear suspension, on the other hand, is pre-compressed and built identical to that of 42029. Compared to 42029, the suspension feels tougher because the buggy&nbsp;is much lighter. Applying&nbsp;some downward resistance when going over road bumps results in better response from the suspension.</p>

<p>Non-functioning aspects include the roll cage and details such as the nitrous exhaust pipes protruding from the sides, sleek paneling, and overhead lights. The cab has a seat which also stands out quite nicely in regular blue and can be reclined forward to a limited extent. A dummy two-handle steering wheel is also featured.</p>

<p>The chassis is solidly built and like 42029 this is a set meant to be played with heavily. It provides a working introduction to basic car mechanics and one of its defining strengths is its straightforwardness in presentation. Unlike some of the more recent supercars&nbsp;released, the core functions are not shrouded by on-the-surface details or sugarcoated. I think the price was $70 CAD which is a pretty good deal considering this is a medium-sized set with all the pertinent functions.</p>

"alexfig8","2016-07-20T01:12:04.007Z","Target clearance pickup, totally worth it!","<p>I saw this set a few years ago at the Lego store, Target, and basically anywhere I went that sold Lego sets. &nbsp;I wanted it, but the $60 price tag seemed a big much. &nbsp;Last week, I was browsing the aisles at Target and found that they were clearancing many Lego items, this being one. &nbsp;Instead of being $59.99, it was now $41.98, which was a price I couldn&#39;t really pass up. &nbsp;I decided to pick it up and I&#39;m glad I did.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty good size, and fits the bags and instructions rather snugly. &nbsp;Upon opening it, you&#39;ll find that the bags are squished in pretty tightly with the two instruction booklets laid flat on the bottom. &nbsp;I like this, because the bags being shoved in between the top and instructions helps to keep them pretty flat. &nbsp;There is also a sticker sheet which stayed pretty flat, as it was also in with the instructions. &nbsp;The instructions are clear and easy to read. &nbsp;In steps where it&#39;s difficult to see exactly where the pieces are put on, the places where pieces are put are circled in red. &nbsp;Techinc instructions are usually a bit more difficult to follow, especially when you&#39;re nearing the end of a chassis build, because seemingly everything is blocked by another part, but they&#39;re not too bad. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A pretty good haul! &nbsp;You get 4 very large &quot;balloon&quot; tires that would go great on a monster truck or tractor, as well as the rims to fit inside them in a lime green color, lime green and light blue panels for the fenders and exterior. &nbsp;You also get 4 tigher-coiled springs to function as shocks, as well as a lot of ball and socket joint parts that all function as part of the suspension. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me probably 2 hours to complete and was pretty fun. &nbsp;The only parts that were repetitive were the suspension builds and the rear fender builds. &nbsp;But, it wasn&#39;t anything annoying, and frankly I really liked the suspension builds, they used some interesting techniques and were fun to work on. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s an awesome performance off-roader. &nbsp;The whole look of the truck is cool, with the monstrous tires, sponsorship stickers all over the place, massive lights on the roll cage, an awsome engine and the huge shock absorbers sticked out in the front. &nbsp;The color scheme is unique but it works. &nbsp;And for those of you that hate stickers, I highly recommend that you DO put them on, because it really helps with the look of the truck. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think it&#39;d have the same feel to it if it were just blank panels on the sides. &nbsp;The truck has four main play features. &nbsp;There is a knob above the roll cage which controls the front steering. &nbsp;It&#39;s the same basic setup as a normal Technic car or truck, being gear driven. &nbsp;Nothing too crazy. &nbsp;The second one is working engine pistons, which do move up and down when the rear wheels turn. &nbsp;This is also gear driven, as you may be able to guess. &nbsp;There are four of them in the usual yellow color. &nbsp;The third feature is independent suspension for all four wheels. &nbsp;The truck sits at a really good level in my opinion and gives it quite a mean stance. &nbsp;A common complaint seems to be that the springs are too tight, meaning that it&#39;s difficult to bounce the truck up and down. &nbsp;Personally, I think it&#39;s actually fine, because if the springs were the looser one, the truck would drop a lot easier and could make it look a little..off. &nbsp;When the front of the truck is as low as possible, it doesn&#39;t look right in my opinion. &nbsp;That&#39;s just me though. &nbsp;Again, building the suspension is actually pretty fun and a unique part. &nbsp;The fianl big feature is the roll&nbsp;cage, which is built in two parts. &nbsp;The back section is attached the the truck and the front section flips up and down to cover the seat and steering wheel. &nbsp;The front section contains the floodlights. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great set. &nbsp;I would check your local Target if you&#39;re in the US, because it may be on clearance there too. &nbsp;I hihgly recommend you pick it up if you enjoy trucks, off road vehicles or cool builds. &nbsp;</p>

"gloslegofan","2015-08-11T00:24:24.07Z"," Great chassis for moc'ing - adding PFs etc","<p>This set provides a great base chassis for modding/moc&#39;ing.</p>

<p>Although it took a while and several iterations (but that just adds to the value) I have managed to add motorised drive and steering turning this into a fun little Remote Controlled off-roader.</p>

<p>I added a Medium Motor and AA Battery Pack (both available in&nbsp;Power Functions set&nbsp;8293), a Servo Motor for steering, IR Receiver, and a IR Remote Control. If you don&#39;t have any of these items already they will be a significant additional cost, but in my opinion they are worth it if you like to build Technic MOCs. These of course take up a lot of space, therefore I have had to remove&nbsp;the pistons and the seat, and have re-designed the roll cage. At the moment the motorised version isn&#39;t the prettiest but I plan to improve this further.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you can find this set discounted (and it has been discounted significantly by some retailers in the&nbsp;UK recently) then I highly&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;purchasing this set to use as a basic chassis to build your own modifications on.</p>

"Sarang","2017-02-20T15:11:35.847Z","Best Parts Pack at best price!","<p>I got this set when it was discounted and I must say that I am absolutely sure that it was worth it. This set is a easy way for Technic novices to understand and build the complex mechanics of a technic car or for that matter a real car as well.</p>

<p><strong>Box/ Instructions</strong></p>

<p>My complaint is that this great set has the &quot;push tab&quot; box which damages the box quite a bit if you plan on reusing/ keeping it by collapsing it. Apart from that nothing out of the ordinary here. Instructions are easy to follow is all I can say.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a parts pack and there are a lot of the useful and interesting ones here, starting off...Lime green and medium blue panels!! Suspension (hard), CV joint parts,wheel hubs, huge balloon tires, lime green rims, ball joint pieces, differential housing, and many more such pieces. You can find most of the parts that are wanted for building a technic car chassis.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build took me about 2 hours and was good. I especially liked the way the front suspension and steering is constructed, it is quite complex and has a large number of parts used. The rest of the build is OK and is not too repetitive.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>In comparison to the number of parts used, the racer looks quite large partly due to those huge balloon tires. It is a treat to watch all the different components move just like in a real car. My only complaint is that in the B model there is no front suspension and that the springs are just for the looks.</p>

<p><strong>Modifications</strong></p>

<p>I was able to easily mod the set to include a L-motor by removing the engine and placing the battery box in the place of the seat. The steering was tricky due to lack of space but I replaced the knob on top with the servo motor. The reciever was just hanging. Once you motorize the car you get the real feel of the suspension and the differential.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is one set I would recommend to any Technic builder wanting to start with complex cars having suspension etc. But at discount this set is also good as a introduction to the complex mechanics of a real car.</p>
