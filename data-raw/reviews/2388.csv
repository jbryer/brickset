"krysto2002","2008-07-23T17:50:38.84Z","Bigger than it seems, much bigger...","This is a massive vehicle, and is a great set with lots of details, like the chain in the back, the multiple headlights, interchangeable laser tips, dynamite!, the hoses to the attachments, and that massive engine! This set has it all, from a huge drill, a powerful radar, a laser cutter, and a cargo hold! The cockpit is more detailed than any other in the series, since the minifigures actually have seats, steering wheels, and there is room for a passenger. The rotating laser only adds to the fun, and the playabilty, since who wouldn't want a giant light-up laser cannon (I would!)? One minifigure is a little stingy, since this set could easily have a co-pilot like docs or sparks, but alone can do, but the playability would jump up. 
This set also could use a Rock Monster, but at $30 that would kind of cut it close to raising the price, so we will settle for just a laser, a drill, a radar, car base, giant wheels, a giant cock pit with cool roll cage, and a cargo hold.

It even has a working light, and you can add more or less transparent parts to it. It also comes with one ore and an energy crystal. It also has some tools including a saw, a drill, and another tool. Includes the Rock Raider minifigure Axel. It has a container-thing for storage in the back, and you can easily take it out to store things in.

PROS:
-Working laser-light
-Tools
-Room for storage
-The big rare drill
-Ore and energy crystal

CONS:
-Needed another minifig than only Axel
-No Rock Monster

OVERALL:
A few more energy crystals would be nice, as you need more of them to really get on with the fun, but you can buy alot too on BrickLink or eBay.
The Axel minifig is nice but it needed another minifig, such as Sparks.
The real light is very cool, it is a great piece.

"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-10-29T17:59:17.687Z","A true treasure among the LEGO franchises","Before I really got myself into Bionicle, there was Rock Raiders. For me, the entire toy line represented a grand time in my childhood, and the Chrome Crusher was one of the Rock Raiders sets I enjoyed the most.

I could remember the day I had finally saved up enough money to get this. However, on the day I planned to build it, I had a Bday party to go to. I wanted to build this MORE! Maybe the anticipation made it more memorable. Anyway, onto the Pros and Cons.

PROS
Sets like those in the Rock Raiders line are rather rare to find these days. I say this meaning that these kind of sets came with an abundance of accessories and tools for a minifig. Wrench, jackhammer, scanner ""binoculars,"" dynamite, the list goes on. The set also has great playability, particularly the ability to customize the design of the laser cutter drill on the Chrome Crusher's top. This set also includes a large bucket piece that slides out. I found this piece invaluable when constructing MOCs in later years. The chrome drill is literally the symbol of the Rock Raiders, and it is practically the main event of this set. I also enjoyed the Rock Raiders Minifigs, and my favorite was Axel, driver of the Chrome Crusher.

CONS
The architecture of the Chrome Crusher isn't necessarily perfect. The wheels, though immensely large, are placed in the back of the vehicle, and a good portion of the vehicle's machinery and apparatus is crammed in the front. It gave the Chrome Crusher an odd front-heavy look. 

The negatives are few, and the plusses of this set are so indispensible. Like I said, great nostalgia overcomes me when I see this set. Its great color scheme, combined with a rare quality seen in older sets and excellent features make the Chrome Crusher one of my favorite sets. Ever. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I like the laser turret on the top which sviwels full 360Â°. I don't really remember if the batteries for this laser come with this set. I think they don't but as I told you: I don't really remember that. The laser piece is also a rare piece and we also get two other rare pieces like the brown roll cage and the silver driller. Inside the cockpit you can see a computer and two steering wheels and on the back of the cockpit you can find some tools. On the one side you can see the driller and on the other one you can see the radar. I also love the dynamite piece and the rock where you can hide the crystal.

"JoystickJunkie","2020-07-20T08:29:00.31Z","Visually interesting, mechanically flawed - delving into 1999's Chrome Crusher","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Lego has covered mining consistently in some form or another, whether it be mining in the City/Town line, recreations of real mining or excavating equipment in the Technic line and science fiction versions of mining in Power Miners and, of course, Rock Raiders.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rock Raiders depicts the story of the crew of the spaceship LMS <i>Explorer</i>, stranded in an unknown galaxy millions of miles from home after a getting sucked into a wormhole/black hole.&nbsp; With their spaceship lacking power for a jump back home, the Rock Raiders now need to mine the nearby Planet U for power crystals to power the <em>Explorer.</em> Along the way, they have to brave the harsh conditions of the subterranean world beneath the surface, with landslides and a scarcity of oxygen, and combat all of its denizens like slimy slugs and Rock Monsters.&nbsp; To aid in the collecting of crystals, the Rock Raiders pressed into service a number of vehicles and transports, one of which is the Chrome Crusher.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">And Rock Raiders wasn&#39;t just Lego sets, it had little comic strips, three books and most of all, a real-time strategy game on the PC and Playstation 1 in the style of something like Age of Empires, Settlers or Command and Conquer.&nbsp; I have a lot of nostalgia for Rock Raiders, owning one or two of the small sets (mainly the 4930 Rock Raiders Crew and the 4910 Hover Scout), and I played the PC game a fair bit back in the day.&nbsp; Now I never got far enough in the Rock Raiders video game to see the Chrome Crusher in action, partly because I wasn&#39;t very good at real-time strategy games back then and partly because the Rock Raiders game was incredibly buggy but as a kid who loved trains, cars and computers, the Rock Raiders visual aesthetic always appealed to me.&nbsp; Something about the heavy industrial look, the shiny chrome drills and those massive, electronic light up lasers, you could picture the Chrome Crusher and other vehicles rumbling through claustrophobic caverns and dark rocky passages, melting rocks into a molten mess of slag as they scooped up the glowing green energy crystals.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rock Raiders wasn&#39;t on shelves for long, so I didn&#39;t get a chance to own the Chrome Crusher but I remember staring at it in the catalogues and ogling the big Lego displays at Myer here in Australia. I picked this up recently with the 4920 Rapid Rider on eBay for about $80 dollars, and so I decided to delve back down into the past with the Rock Raiders.</p>

<p><b>Building Experience</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The build for the Chrome Crusher is a simple bottom to top build process, all built upon a large single chassis piece.&nbsp; We add the front cockpit piece, working our way up and up to the top of the vehicle where the laser is, before adding the giant plastic wheels.&nbsp; There&#39;s two or three tiny sub-builds right at the end for some TNT, a boulder with a crystal in it and the minifigure.&nbsp; All up, the build takes maybe ten to fifteen minutes and there&#39;s no special construction techniques here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Stepping back and taking a look at the finished model, I have to say I wasn&#39;t impressed with how it looked initially.&nbsp; It&#39;s an oddly coloured machine that doesn&#39;t look like anything from the real world.&nbsp; But a few days after building it, my reaction when I see it is one of appreciation.&nbsp; I actually <b>really</b> like how the Chrome Crusher looks visually.&nbsp; It&#39;s got this squat, industrial look, like nothing about it is covered up or done for aesthetics which is how real construction or mining vehicles appear in our world.&nbsp; It appears worn and weathered, with peeling and flaking warning paint and two different colour schemes of turquoise and yellow, like it was half painted and then just put out into the field.&nbsp; It reminds me of some kind of tank or moon rover that was quickly repurposed into mining equipment, which fits the story of Rock Raiders perfectly.&nbsp; You look at it and understand the world that it comes from and the people that use it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Let&#39;s look at the finished model in depth.&nbsp; Working from the front, we have a cockpit with a brown rollcage-esque canopy.&nbsp; The cockpit opens up on a ratcheted hinge to allow you to access two seats inside &mdash; one person presumably drives the Chrome Crusher while the other might control the mining laser on top.&nbsp; Behind the cockpit is a tool rack with three clips for holding accessories you might take on a mining mission.&nbsp; There&#39;s a nice model of a V8 engine behind the tool rack and then a giant, all-in-one piece dump truck/tipper bed piece to hold rocks, crystals, dynamite and whatever you might need for big demolition work.&nbsp; On top of the tipper bed is a tower with the mining laser, which is able to turn freely 360 degrees on a 4x4 turntable.&nbsp; Some black pipes help to break up the long rectangular shape of the Chrome Crusher by adding some curves and textures to the sides.&nbsp; And back at the front, we&#39;ve got a silver spiral shaped drill bit and a radar, presumably to help us scan the rocks to know what we&#39;re about to mine.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Structurally speaking, the build has some gaps in the chassis which you can see if you&#39;re looking above and from the side, but the black wheels help to hide it and given it&#39;s meant to be a bare-bones industrial vehicle I don&#39;t think this matters as much.&nbsp; The drill isn&#39;t as far forward as I would like, just barely in front of the cockpit, so you could make some modifications to improve the drill&#39;s forward range and remedy this issue.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">One problem that is immediately noticeable as you try to drive the Chrome Crusher is the weight distribution.&nbsp; The Chrome Crusher&#39;s centre of mass is located somewhere near the front and it can tip forward quite easily with the lightest push of a finger.&nbsp; I&#39;m no engineer but I think it&#39;s because the four big wheels are all the way at the back half of the Chrome Crusher, and the cockpit and the front half have lots of brick built stuff on it, creating a lot of weight that isn&#39;t properly counterbalanced.&nbsp;&nbsp;This could have been remedied by perhaps elevating the cockpit up and pushing it further towards the centre of the chassis piece but I&#39;ll cover all of this in playability.&nbsp; As it stands, the Chrome Crusher looks visually great and the building experience is simple yet engaging.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">We get one Rock Raiders minifigure included in the Chrome Crusher, the black suited vehicle specialist Axel with a nice torso print depicting some pouches, goggles and a type of harness for him to wear.&nbsp; He has a brown helmet with trans-light green visor, and a detailed yet stylised face print.&nbsp; Axel appears in nearly all the major land vehicles that the Rock Raiders have, acting as the driver for both the 4940 Granite Grinder and the 4950 Loader-Dozer.&nbsp; He&#39;s working solo here, as he always does, so you might want to pair him up with another Rock Raider for mining duty.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Parts</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Chrome Crusher has a good mix of generic but useful bricks and a selection of large specialised pieces, but there&#39;s nothing here that is set exclusive or any pieces that elevate this set to a must-buy for parts alone.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">First, let&#39;s talk about the base of the model &mdash; the large dark grey chassis piece.&nbsp; The chassis on which the wheels are attached, and the whole of the Chrome Crusher is built, is one giant piece.&nbsp; It&#39;s long, wide, and it appeared in the 4950 Loader-Dozer and 7249 Mobile Crane.&nbsp; I know a lot of Lego fans decry massive pieces such as this, as it&#39;s not &#39;brick-built&#39; or they&#39;re too specialised as a piece but I don&#39;t think you can simply say it&#39;s all bad. For a kid like me, who didn&#39;t own many sets, big specialised pieces or all-in-one pieces were foundations to build on.&nbsp; It meant you could use your precious bricks to build something else, they make a great starting position for the creations you want to build like a submarine or a trailer.&nbsp; That being said, this piece isn&#39;t used as well as it could be here as the wheels on the chassis are quite close together and much of the weight of the Chrome Crusher is focused towards the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Next, you&#39;ve got the cockpit bottom piece, which is designed to match up with the large brown roll cage cockpit top.&nbsp; This one is a bit more specialised, I&#39;ll admit, as I don&#39;t know if any other sort of cockpit or canopy could be put on it other than the one provided here.&nbsp; This piece only ever appeared in dark grey, and only ever appeared in Rock Raiders with that brown roll cage canopy, so you could argue its use is limited. But again, it&#39;s a good base and maybe an enterprising builder could make something new and brilliant out of this piece.&nbsp; Also large and bulky is the dark grey dump truck tipper bed, which is used as the hold/bed for all your minerals and crystals.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">What catches the eye the most however are the silver chrome pieces, mainly the silver drill pieces.&nbsp; This wouldn&#39;t be nearly as nice as set if this piece was in metallic silver or dull silver.&nbsp; The shine just brings the whole model up a notch and really helps to add some visual flair to the Chrome Crusher (and gives it the Chrome part of its name).&nbsp; It&#39;s not a rare piece either, or expensive, so you if you want to get this drill on its own Bricklink has you sorted for a good price.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Now the pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance:&nbsp; the electric laser on the top of the Chrome Crusher.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This electric laser is not a laser pointer or a high-powered torch, but just a simply little bulb inside a big housing.&nbsp; It runs on two AAA batteries, and pressing the button on the top emits a light from the front of the laser.&nbsp; Attaching differently shaped trans coloured pieces to the 1x1 stud on the front allows different focusing of the beam, but I don&#39;t think it allows different colours or tints to the beam as it always appears as orange to me.&nbsp; It&#39;s got a small spot to attach Lego clips or studs with clips, it&#39;s got seven studs on the top and bottom to connect somewhere and looks like a big science fiction ray gun &mdash; which it sort of is, so that&#39;s points there.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Now I&#39;m sure that a kid would enjoy this piece simply for the fact that it lights up, it&#39;s big, it looks like a laser gun, all the stuff kids like but I think it&#39;s pretty poor. The electric laser has some great shaping but the brightness of the light is underwhelming, barely emitting 20 cm or so. Maybe that&#39;s an issue with my individual laser light bulb but if this is working as intended, it&#39;s a pretty poor effort.&nbsp; It looks good on the Chrome Crusher but I think it could find use in your Lego creations or, if you build and collect Lego with your kids, in your kid&#39;s creations.&nbsp; It could be a space laser, a scanner, an engine, some kind of scientific device.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">With those big and special pieces out of the way, you&#39;ve got a variety of bricks and plates in turquoise, which is a really lovely looking colour and definitely pops against Lego&#39;s light grey and dark grey.&nbsp; You&#39;ve got four big plastic wheels that look like they could take a serious beating.&nbsp; There are smatterings of yellow and black bricks throughout and a view trans-light green pieces to add a sci-fi look which would definitely be useful in all sorts of builds, from futuristic to modern day.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Playability</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">When it comes to playability, I think this is where the Chrome Crusher begins to disappoint as it&#39;s a very static set all things considered, and lacks some things to increase the playability in my opinion.&nbsp; It&#39;s also got some design choices that really hamper its playability, primarily in its construction and the form of the Chrome Crusher.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Firstly, a play function or two could really bring this set up a notch.&nbsp; I thought for a long time that the drill might have been linked to the wheels, so that moving the Chrome Crusher made the drill spin but as I found out when I bought this and put it together, that&#39;s not the case.&nbsp; The drill doesn&#39;t move unless you reach over and turn it with your hand. I&#39;m a bit disappointed that the drill doesn&#39;t spin as it would have made for a great visual element.&nbsp; I suppose a kid could imagine it&#39;s moving so fast you can&#39;t even see it moving, but I think a play function like a moving drill would have brought this up a notch.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Secondly, the electronic laser. As I mentioned before, the light from the laser is quite weak and it lacks punch.&nbsp; Some kind of laser noise emitting when you pressed the button would have spiced this up, like a hum of a futuristic laser, or maybe upping the light intensity somewhat so that the beam is brighter. An option to leave the light on without having to hold down the button would have been nice too, like a toggle switch.&nbsp; Those probably couldn&#39;t have been done for reasons of costs, health and safety, rules regarding electric lights and lasers on kids toys or simply space constraints, but what <b>could</b> have been done is attaching the electric laser to a friction hinge of some kind.&nbsp; The laser can turn around 360 degrees but it can&#39;t point down or up.&nbsp; Maybe the laser was too heavy to attach to a 2x4 hinge due to the weight of the batteries, and having it tip forward could alter the centre of mass, but being unable to adjust the vertical position of the laser limits the play possibilities you can have.&nbsp; Also, the laser really pushed the price of this set up back in the day, and you don&#39;t really get a lot of bang for your buck with it &mdash; I&#39;d have rather seen the price put towards a Rock Monster or some more minifigures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thirdly, and most egregious for me, is the weight distribution issue that I&#39;ve already touched on at a few points in this review.&nbsp; As you push the Chrome Crusher around, the front keeps dipping down as the centre of mass is just behind the front of the cockpit, where the majority of all the bricks and plates are located.&nbsp; The whole thing keeps bouncing up and down like it&#39;s some kind of industrial low-rider.&nbsp; This bobbing and dipping is due to the four black wheels being far back on that chassis piece and more weight being put on the front cockpit area &mdash; it makes the entire vehicle front-heavy.&nbsp; It&#39;s even more noticeable if you take out the batteries from the laser and try driving it across a flat surface, the back wheels barely make contact with the ground as there&#39;s even less weight on the back of the Chrome Crusher.&nbsp; This could have been remedied by putting the cockpit up higher and further towards the middle of the chassis piece, but I&#39;m not sure how I would do that myself and a modification like that would require extensive reworking of the set&#39;s shaping. I feel like this is something that should have been caught during the development of the Chrome Crusher.&nbsp; If it&#39;s a wheeled vehicle and you can&#39;t drive it in a straight line due to the front wanting to kiss the dirt, you should probably redesign the vehicle.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">My biggest problem with this set, aside from the weight distribution, is a lack of a second minifigure or some kind of threat.&nbsp; Rock Raiders was a line about a group of stalwart miners deep underground, battling the elements and the creatures of the underground and as I mentioned beforehand we only get one minifigure, Axel.&nbsp; Axel also appeared in the 4940 Granite Grinder and 4950 Loader-Dozer, and he&#39;s working solo here in the same way he worked solo there.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have a problem with him appearing by himself in those two sets, as those are single seat vehicles, but the Chrome Crusher has two seats and sort of implies that someone should be with him here.&nbsp; What gives Lego?&nbsp; Why is Axel all by himself?&nbsp; Is he a loner, or some of intolerable jerk?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I think the Chrome Crusher should have included a second minifigure to sit in the passenger seat AND to create more play possibilities.&nbsp; What if the Chrome Crusher gets trapped in a cave in and the two Rock Raiders have to dig their way out with rapidly diminishing oxygen supplies?&nbsp; What if they are on an exploration mission looking for crystals, but they both don&#39;t like each other?&nbsp; As it stands, Axel is working by himself and it limits the stories a child could tell.&nbsp; If Lego was averse to putting in a second minifigure, they should have given us a Rock Monster or some kind of antagonist or problem to aid in creating more play possibilities. The Rock Monster was only available in the 4950 Loader-Dozer and the Rock Raiders HQ, so it would have been great to get one and to create a new story possibility.&nbsp; Maybe Axel gets ambushed by the Rock Monster and has to hide inside the Chrome Crusher?&nbsp; Maybe the Rock Monster is curious as to what&#39;s going on, and they actually get along?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Value for Money</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I paid about $80 dollars for the Chrome Crusher and the 4920 Rapid Rider together, both with instructions and both missing some small parts.&nbsp; That&#39;s not a bad price when you think about it.&nbsp; On Bricklink, the Chrome Crusher goes for about $65 dollars complete, not including shipping and handling. I think $80 for this set alone is quite steep and I don&#39;t think I would pick it up at that price.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sure, some pieces are semi-unique and electronic based but I think at most you should be paying $40 to $60 dollars for a good condition Chrome Crusher.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think the electronic laser on the top is worth much to be honest but without it the set looks unfinished so it needs something on the top to round out the visual profile.&nbsp; Maybe you could make a crane with a pulley on the top or some kind of brick-built laser gun?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Final Thoughts</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As a child, the main reason I was attracted to Rock Raiders was the connection to the PC game and the desire I had to own these sets.&nbsp; My cousin had the Granite Grinder, I&#39;d seen the Rock Raiders HQ on its huge raised baseplate and wanted it all.&nbsp; But the sticky thing is that Rock Raiders represents the weird 90s Lego, for better and worse.&nbsp; It represents them throwing anything at all the wall to see what would stick, it represents them putting in odd gimmicks at the sake of structure and design.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Don&#39;t get me wrong, I look at the Chrome Crusher and I still really like it in terms of a display piece and a visual representation of a line I have great nostalgia for, but as an actual functioning set it leaves much to be desired.&nbsp; The Chrome Crusher has a great visual identity, with a low profile like a tank, a scuffed workmanlike exterior, splashes of colour and nice details like lights, sirens, pipes and more.&nbsp; But it&#39;s fundamentally flawed in its construction, with gimmicky electronic functions, a lone minifigure, a critical design issue in its centre of mass and some other small problems that make it hard to recommend wholeheartedly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&#39;d say if you find it for cheap or need to complete a Rock Raiders collection, absolutely pick it up.&nbsp; It&#39;s worth the price of admission but don&#39;t break the bank chasing this one down.</p>
