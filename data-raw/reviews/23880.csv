<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It has a medium size box, the instructions are very well done and clear.&nbsp;I really enjoyed the fact that there was only one &#39;big&#39; instruction manual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Part are very cool and interesting, some of them are new in this color (bright green).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are no minifigures in this set like in all Technic.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It took me about three hours to build and was a lot of fun. Thanks&nbsp;to the well made instruction manual it has been quite easy to build. The only part I have completely disliked was putting together the engine to the &#39;tubes&#39;: I had to push very&nbsp;hard to push the blue pins into these tubes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When finished it gives a good impression, it looks very&nbsp;well done. the only thing that doesn&#39;t attract me is the front as&nbsp;the lights could have been done better in my opinion.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is an excellent set, I wanted this so badly, and it hasn&#39;t disappointed me. The price is right so if I were you I&#39;d buy it!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A nice big box with fantastic print quality and detailed explanation of the vehicles functions - pretty standard for flagship Technic sets. There is one large bound instruction manual, great print quality as usual, although I would prefer 2 smaller stapled booklets - the large one tends to want to close itself when you get near the middle and makes it hard to see instructions that are close to the bind.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Quite a few of them! The new green is nice, it won&#39;t match anything in your current collection though. That said there is a lot of green parts so there is a nice selection for custom work. White parts are always nice to have too. A few new parts - notably the gears and clutches which are not totally compatible with previous parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A fun build, and some interesting techniques in use. A few steps really made me question what was going on and if there was a mistake (notably the sticker for the selector switch - I thought was printed the wrong way around) but then as you progress you realise it is perfectly correct and the function works in a completely different way, and is quite impressive!</p>

<p>There were a couple of steps that I questioned the &quot;Lego Legality&quot; of, especially one step that starts to build the chassis which requires you to effectively bend a beam out of the way to fit pins into it for another beam.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very large! Much larger than I was expecting, but it looks fantastic, and works perfectly. The door opening mechanism is very clever too. Suspension works well, although the travel is quite long for an LMP car, and it does mean at full compression the front wing scrapes the floor - a minor gripe though as you have to push down quite a lot to do that. There are some components in the build that are not used, unless you add power functions - but this only powers existing functions, not drive and steering.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great build and impressive end result. I am yet to build the B model yet, but that too looks great (SUV racer). Functions are well designed and it offers some interesting ideas for custom builders to incorporate into models too.</p>

"BarbossaThePianist","2016-10-01T22:46:24.787Z","Great set","<p>Great set!&nbsp; Pretty fun to build, absolutely LOVE the color scheme considering that green is my favorite color.&nbsp; It&#39;s pretty big, too!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have to say it was very smart of Lego to make one fat instruction booklet not 2-3 smaller ones that you have to keep together so they don&#39;t get mixed up with others.</p>

<p>Probably the piece is the fender; it makes it really look really sleek.&nbsp; The wheels are really cool too.</p>

<p>The next Technic set everyone has to buy is this one :D</p>

"martiniman","2016-09-03T06:07:07.623Z","Much nicer looking than expected","<p>First thought when this came out was I can skip it. Lego introduces a new colour to Technic, and that usually means a small selection of parts in a new colour, not suitable for much else. The stickery promotional image did not appeal at first.</p>

<p>Then I saw the completed model in our local Lego store, and thought: well that is actually a pretty cool model.</p>

<p><img alt=""Overview"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42039-1.jpg"" style=""width: 1064px; height: 708px;"" /></p>

<h3>Buying</h3>

<p>Either way, if you buy this complete or by extra needed parts as I did, it is very affordable. 90&euro; for 1219 parts is great, and if you just buy the green parts on Bricklink, you can be set with say 30&euro; in parts. Even the thick instruction book does only 1 or 2 &euro; on Bricklink. Because this set has a lot of generic nice panels, in bot black, white and green, the part price is pretty low.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instruction book is nice, a single thick book as introduced with the Volvo Loader. Using the PDF works easy to as this set does not have much dark grey pieces. They are always difficult on screen. There&#39;s little repetition yet we keep the modern inventory box problem: please Lego let us grab bricks per spread of pages, not per single step.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p><img alt=""Lots of green"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42039-4.jpg"" style=""width: 1064px; height: 532px;"" /></p>

<p>There is a lot of bright green stuff. The curved wheel house panel is a new one for this model, and is used now in more models like the Race Kart and the 42056 sports car. First I thought why not continue with classic green, now I have a third green in Technic, but I have to say the colour works really nice on the model. Classic green would have looked good too I guess.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42039-3.jpg"" style=""width: 1064px; height: 708px;"" /></p>

<p>For the money you get a lot: many big black panels, white wing panels, green panels, suspension parts, nice wheels, many green liftarms. This set does not differ much when it comes to special part count when you compare it to the new 42056. Here you get them way cheaper!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This car is mostly about building. The process is very nice. Lego does not stick too long to making a very complicated chassis, at least half the effort is in the exterior. You build a nice and good working front and rear suspension, a little mech for operating the Gulwing doors and the motor lid and then you move to the very nice cladding process.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This car looks very cool when you are done. I think it is one of the nicest looking big cars when done. The colour palette works really well. Black and grey on the inside. White and green on the outside, and some nice red accents. The stickers are not adding anything, I replaced the red stickers on the mirrors with a red curved brick. Now a brick sets the accent instead of a sticker.</p>

<p><img alt=""Motor cover"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42039-6.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Functionality is pretty boring: it steers ok, you have the usual multi cylinder engine, and there are 2 lid opening controls that offer functionality close to the cheap 8&euro; models: a simple wormed gear lifting mech.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42039-5.jpg""><img alt=""Gulwing mech"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42039-5.jpg"" style=""width: 1064px; height: 708px;"" /></a></p>

<p>The suspension works well. I advice to put little pegs with knobs (blue and light grey ones) in the bottom panels. This protects the large surface of panels on the bottom from scratching. I rather scratch some 5ct pegs than the panels that usually do 1-2&euro; a piece loose.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set really excels in delivering bang for the buck. Lots of great panels, suspension parts and wheels for little money. For that money you get awesome looking car. Lego really nailed it here in making a nice looking Technic car, with more panels and less flex rods (don&#39;t like flex rod style). The new bowed panels work great, the lights are done well and the openness is perfect: not too see-tru, neither too closed up.</p>

"Matthias_K","2016-11-13T01:53:04.7Z","Three awesome Technic cars","<p>When I requested this set for my birthday, I mostly did because I wanted to build&nbsp;<a href=""https://rebrickable.com/mocs/Damjan/grand-prix-racer"">this</a> awesome Formula 1 MOC as a companion to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42000-1/Grand-Prix-Racer"">Grand Prix Racer</a> I&nbsp;already&nbsp;owned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I got the set, I was impressed&nbsp;with the way the 24-Hour Racer looked on the box and I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;build that&nbsp;first. I&nbsp;fully expected to move on to Formula 1 MOC soon after, but&nbsp;I fell in love with the 24-Hour Racer instead. The model just looks so good once build, that I could not take it apart for months after.&nbsp;The optional PF&nbsp;motor is integrated very well (unlike with the Grand Prix Racer) so it&#39;s still one of the best looking Technic sets after motorization.&nbsp;After playing around with the set and admiring it for a while, I still could&nbsp;not bring myself to dismantle it, so I came up with a way to motorize the wheels, while keeping the aesthetics intact.</p>

<p>After finally being able to tear it down, I build the Formula 1 MOC with it. That was a very interesting build as well and it also provided a great looking car. It looked great next to the Grand Prix Racer and I think I actually prefer the look of this MOC over the Grand Prix Racer.</p>

<p>Several weeks later, I found myself missing the 24-Hour Racer and I decided to tear it down again. First I wanted to quickly build the not very great-looking B-model just so I could cross that off the list. Yet&nbsp;again&nbsp;I was surprised by how &nbsp;good-looking the actual B-model was compared to the photos. I also really liked the retractable&nbsp;headlights. I do think the Formula 1 MOC is a bit better fit as a B-Model, but this official B-model is great too.</p>

<p>As you can see, I think this set is very much worth getting as it will provide three&nbsp;excellent builds and very good looking and very playable cars. The set has therefore exceeded all of my expectations and it&#39;s one of the best birthday presents I&#39;ve gotten.</p>
