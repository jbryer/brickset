"mini_mads1980","2015-01-26T11:58:15.17Z","Another ATV","<p>This only costs &pound;5 in the UK, and is supposed to be an &quot;impulse buy&quot; set which to me feels like Lego forgot to make the set interesting.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the smallest of the City set boxes.&nbsp; On the front is a nice looking picture of the crook running away from the swamp policeman, who is in his ATV.&nbsp; You can also see in the picture the hiding spot for&nbsp;the crook&#39;s&nbsp;stolen money and bag.&nbsp; The sides and bottom of the box have the standard information.</p>

<p>The top of the box has a picture of the swamp policeman, having just caught a dangerous looking snake and the 1:1 is the crook from the set.&nbsp; The back shows the crook hiding his money and then a picture of the crook being led away with the swamp policeman carrying a bag with only 100 note&nbsp;in it - what happen to the other 100??&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instruction booklet is 24 pages long.&nbsp; It has the same picture as the box front and surprisingly on page 22 has a list of older City Police sets (60041, 60042, 60043, 60044, 60046 and 60047) before a list of the parts in the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are nothing special, however the 2x1 slope at the front of the ATV is a printed piece, so that is a bonus as no stickers are used at all.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get two in this set.&nbsp; A lower ranked swamp policeman and a crook who appears to be the identical twin brother of the one in the Starter Set 60066.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a basic build, but with only 59 pieces you were never going to have a set that was too hard to put together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It does what it is supposed to do, I just feel that a small police boat would have suited the swamp feel of this batch of police sets better.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set is solid enough and you have the playability of good v bad, even if the crook has no chance of escape against the ATV so any chase would be short lived.&nbsp; If you want all the sets (like I do) in this range then get this one.&nbsp; If you want a small set for a few pounds then get 60066 which is by far a better set with double the minifugures (one the same as this set), a means of transport for both swamp police and crooks&nbsp;with a lot more playability and hours more fun.</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-02-08T20:30:21.34Z","Yet Another ATV!","<p>It&#39;s PicnicBasketSam yet again, reviewing yet another tiny CITY set! Today it&#39;s the smallest Swamp Police set, which I bought on impulse for a few parts, namely, the snake and printed cheese slope.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As I covered in my review of 60011, the box and instructions are standard $7 size. A surprisingly large number of parts flow out when I open up all the bags... it&#39;s already better than 60011.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As the main thing I got the set for, they don&#39;t disappoint. A brand-new variant of the 1x1 clip, a red snake, a big dark green life, $200 in LEGO money, and a printed 1x2 cheese slope that says &quot;POLICE&quot; in block capitals. Plus, there&#39;s&nbsp;59 of them... I half expected the set to be $10 with that many.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>An outdoorsy-looking cop and a standard crook. I love that dark tan baseball cap.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fast. Only worrying thing I found is that there&#39;s a 2x6 brick instead of several plates in the base, which makes it look too chunky for a swamp-equipped off-roader.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It does the job better than the last 2 ATVs. Gone is the empty wheelbarrow, replaced by some swamp scenery and a sack. Gone is the futuristic looking and clip-covered ATV style, replaced by&nbsp;a more outdoorsy, chunky, realistic design. There&#39;s even a play feature with the swamp scenery; you can put money or snakes under the big leaf. Nothing astounding, but still... wheelbarrows.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is an even better impulse set than Surfer Rescue. It has twice as many parts, a creature, two figs, and a sizable build for each one. It outdos ATVs from 2013 and 2014 by a huge amount and doesn&#39;t look futuristic or dorky. One of the best Swamp Police sets. Buy one! Right now!</p>
