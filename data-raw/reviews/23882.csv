"mini_mads1980","2015-01-26T09:56:03Z","Great Starter Set","<p>This set proves that first impressions of sets can be completely wrong.&nbsp; I thought that all three of the smaller Starter Sets were going to be terrible on first view of them.&nbsp; In fact I only picked this set and 60088 up because they were already reduced in a supermarket - I now wish they had had&nbsp;60072.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the standard size for a set of about &pound;9.&nbsp; The front shows two crooks and a couple of swamp police officers, one of which is more of a CSI type woman, along with an Alligator/Crocodile, a red spider, small raft and a swamp boat.&nbsp; The new 2015 style box looks great (as they all do) and in the bottom corner it proudly states Starter Set.</p>

<p>The sides have various warnings and the bottom of the box has production information and the barcode.&nbsp; The top 1:1 picture is of the Swamp Policeman (sideways to fit box depth), and a nice picture of the younger crook hiding hill ill-gotten gains.</p>

<p>On the back we see what appear to be 1:1 scale images of all of the minifigures in the set.&nbsp; An image of the raft being quickly caught by the swamp boat, and the police woman leading the two crook away to enjoy some free board.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is a small set, and only contains 76 parts, but what LEGO has done with those parts is fantastic.&nbsp; I was initially disapointed with the Crocodile tail, which attaches to the body by a blue pin.&nbsp; It looked like it was never coming out again, however using the oar I was able to remove the pin quite easily.</p>

<p>I did smile when I opened the bag and saw the old space seat, which has room for a spaceman&#39;s airtank.&nbsp; It brought back memories of my 1980&#39;s sets,&nbsp;and this put the parts up a point in my view!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>FOUR! Yes, four minifgures in a set this size, and I paid &pound;1 less than recommended too!&nbsp; They are not anything special, but for a Starter Set this is great&nbsp; You get two good and two bad which is going to enable hours of play without having to purchase other sets straight away.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A couple of minutes is all it takes to build this, but with only 76 parts it was never going to take long.&nbsp; The Swamp Boat is nicely put together, although the binoculars do fall off easily.</p>

<p>I marked the build experience up to three because of the nice use of SNOT for the raft.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There are three main elements and they all compliment each other well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set, and I hope that the other Starter Sets are just as good!&nbsp; If you see this in any store for the retail price or less then grab it!</p>

"legodad1","2016-04-28T07:21:06.19Z","3 Beasties, 4 Peops, lots of accessories for little expense","<p>Having recently acquired a Pirates set I&#39;ve been keeping an eye out for a cheap way of purchasing a crocodile. This was my primary reason for buying this set (and it was on special) but it comes with an awful lot more for its size!</p>

<p>We get three swamp&nbsp;beasties: The crocodile with opening mouth and waggling tail, a snake and a red spider.</p>

<p>We also get four minifigures, two male crims, a male cop and a female cop. Counting the &#39;spare&#39; pieces they come with two flash-lights, two pairs of handcuffs, a walkie-talkie, two paddles, two $100 notes, one backpack, one shovel, and one pair of binoculars. We also get a spare red beard which can be added to one of your other minifigures.</p>

<p>Parts-wise, we get a couple of 2x1 SNOT bricks, plus the &#39;space-man&#39;s seat&#39;. The police logo on the front of the fan-boat is a PRINT, not a sticker. We also get five&nbsp;1x4 and two&nbsp;1x2&nbsp;&#39;log&#39; bricks, two different leaf pieces, and a propellor&nbsp;among other parts.</p>

<p>A very-worthwhile acquisition!</p>

"The_Crea1or","2017-10-15T22:53:50.71Z","'Hey get back here!'","<p>While not the best City set released in 2015, it does offer a few interesting parts at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You get the new crocodile mold in a cheap set</li>
	<li>The two vehicles offer enough play value for kids to create a story</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The set doesn&#39;t come with any interesting parts or figures apart from the crocodile</li>
