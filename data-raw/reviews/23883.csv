It was a rather spontaneous decision, but it was truly worth it. Especially after seeing the regular prices spanning from 24.99&euro; to 39.99&euro;!!</p>

<p>This cool set features four different parts: The helicopter itself, a powerboat, a little piece of swamp and a brand new LEGO alligator!<br />
The helicopter is a sturdy and uncomplicated build. The two large swimmers are very cool and big progress since the first helicopter with these, which I had (6342 Beach Rescue Chopper)! There are four bars on the outside for the crew to hold on to, when in mid-air. The blades rotate freely and move very fast. I like the design of the engine with big exhaust pipes! A swamp police officer and a pilot make up the crew of the chopper.<br />
The powerboat is simple, but good, with nasty looking alligator-teeth-stickers on its sides. We have a female crook with it, which I never saw before!<br />
The small swamp piece is very simple, and a little needless, but well, OK. It acts as some kind of disguise for the crooks bag of loot, with a &quot;movable&quot; branch &quot;covering&quot; the sack.<br />
The all new alligator is very cool, with intensive yellow eyes, big jaws and a moving tail.</p>

<p>A negative point for me is the rope, which can be used to drop the police officer. It has no winch or something like that. The set from 1993, mention above, had such a winch. The rope in this set is simply plugged to the swimmers, as seen in the picture.<br />
Another con is the inside of the helicopter, which is left completely empty. It is open from the cockpit to the end of the back (which consists of only one big part). I think, that some kind of storage for handcuffs or a walkie-talkie could have been added.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This brand-new set is a very good addition to every LEGO collection! It has some nice details and and awesome playability, due to the great amount of parts and minifigures. Definitely worth it!!</p>
