"Bumblepants","2015-05-11T03:03:07.227Z","Swamp Police Castle. One day lad, all this will be yours.","<p>Swamp Police brings a new twist to Lego City Police in 2015. Apart from the improbability of such a setup in the real world, this set is pretty fun, especially for kids.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>There are 6 instruction booklets, one for each vehicle, and three more for the main structure. Well designed and perhaps a bit longer than needed in some places with only one part being added in a step.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of nice parts including the new alligator/croc mold in dark green and plenty of dark blue tiles in 1x2, 1x4, 1x8 and 2x4 formats. Lots of SNOT bricks in light grey to attach them as well. The motorbike is dark blue/pearl silver and looks excellent. Hidden on the right side of the structure are 1x12 bricks in light grey with the garage door slot and you get four of them. The slot serves no purpose in the model but it is a nice way to get a few unique parts. The wanted poster sticker for the computer screen in the office portion of the set features an almost Sasquatch looking figure and makes for a fun touch by the graphic designer.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four cops and two robbers, All with excellent printing front and back. There is a female police officer as well as a female crook with a nice dark orange hairpiece. A good example of the current trend toward bringing the male/female ratio in Legoland closer to the norm.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build is broken into four segments. First the fanboat and the small chunk of land to stash the money on. This is quickly followed by the police 4x4. Next comes the station, starting with the office side then bridging over to the holding cell side. Finally, the police speedboat rounds things out. Nothing fancy or new other than the neat trick of attaching tires to the piers with 5L chains. This is a great touch of realism by the designer and adds a lot to the look of the set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When finished, it looks pretty good and about as big as a police station in the swamp ought to be if there is such a thing. The radio antenna helps make the set feel more substantial and the inclusion of the gator, police dog, and several snakes help boost playability. My young children both enjoyed building this set and playing with the various vehicles and the alligator was quite popular with them as well. Another positive in my book is there is no helicopter wedged into this model which seems to happen all too often in City sets these days.<br />
<br />
There are a few complaints I had with this set and most of them involve the 4x4. Firstly, the box art seemingly depicts the truck coming out from underneath the parking area underneath the main office. However, it does not quite fit as the blue emergency lights are just a plate or two too tall. While it wasn&#39;t too difficult to squeeze it under, the brackets holding the lights had to be broken off for the truck to be removed from under the office. This could easily been avoided by raising the height just a tad and would have been a worthwhile move. My second complaint with the truck is the sloppy color choice of having a bright yellow 1x2 on the front underside of the truck. Finally, the truck has no roof which seems rather lazy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>With the two boats, truck, and motorbike the Swamp Police Station offers a lot of playability as do the jail cell with the trap door in the roof and tear-away wall section out front. While there are plenty of nice parts in this set it does feel a bit on the stingy side with barely 700 parts for $90 in the USA. UK/EU pricing seems a bit more fair but overall this is a set you probably want to wait for a good sale on before picking up.</p>

"BuildTheBrick","2018-04-27T23:28:34.927Z","Swamp Station","<p><strong>The building</strong></p>

<p>This is really the greatest set of the Swamp Police Sub theme. On the left is the jail, with a jailbreak feature that breaks the left jail frame, it works by using the no-swing doorframe with a cell door and 2x1 slope bricks on top. It also has stairs up to the catwalk and the top of the jail cell. The Jail Cell roof has another escape feature to be used with the crowbar. The catwalk&nbsp;has parking for the Police boat underneath. And it leads to the chief&#39;s office that is basic with the desk, fan, and coffee maker. Back outside there are some hooks to hang accessories, but that is truly all, except&nbsp;for the fact that underneath the office there is parking for a land vehicle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Police Car</b></p>

<p>The Police get the only land vehicles in this set, the motorcycle, and the Jeep. Open Roof style.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Police Boat</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;The hull does not float, the boat has a spotlight.</p>

<p><strong>The Crook Boat</strong></p>

<p>The only mode of crook travel in this set, does not float, and goes old style.</p>

<p><strong>All in all</strong>&nbsp;this set is a fine addition&nbsp;to the swamp series!</p>

"Brick1","2020-06-15T18:09:14.46Z","My Favorite Lego set","<p>This set is definitely&nbsp;one&nbsp;of my favourite sets, I liked it so much that I payed an outrageous price for it on amazon&nbsp;a couple years after it was released. I have a city layout, and yet I still managed to fit this set in my downtown core! Now thats a sign of a good set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set came with 6 minifigures, 4 cops and 2 robbers. Lego used slightly different torsos for some of the cops, but they are still recognizable as the same branch, or department. I also love the tan-dark blue colour scheme! The criminals wore the obvious striped torso, but it was a little ripped, which was a nice way of differentiating these bad guys from the city bad guys. Definitely couldn&#39;t use it as a normal minifig though, still only bad guys.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles</strong></p>

<p>This set included 4&nbsp;vehicles, 2 water and 2&nbsp;land. The Motorbike&nbsp;is&nbsp;ok, If I was looking at the jeep&nbsp;alone&nbsp;it is pretty decent, but looking at it next to the one from set 60068 was a pretty big disappointment. The police boat is a pretty standard build but it works for what it is&nbsp;meant to be. The criminals boat is the best vehicle! Great colour, and size, but best&nbsp;of all, it can be used just as a civilian boat, it has no features identifying it as a bad guys boat.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Station</b></p>

<p>The station is arguably the best part of the set. I love how they combine straight forward windows with the dark blue tiles on their sides, the bridge and the jail on an island are amazing! The jail is connected to the station by using the same dark blue tiles on their side for one wall but still recognizable as a jail (because of the barred windows). The interior of the station has a desk, coffee machine, and fan, which are ok and the interior of the jail cell has a bed,&nbsp;and washroom setup. The stickers are used well and the radar is a nice touch. A rack to put the life jackets on the grey section under the station and a raising barriar&nbsp;across the front of the underneath of the station to suggest garage a little more would&#39;ve been a nice touch.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Extra&#39;s</strong></p>

<p>There is a little area to hide the bad guys money, which is ok but I did enjoy the addition of wildlife (the alligator and the snakes).&nbsp;</p>
