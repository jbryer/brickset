<p>Nice image on box. Easy to follow instruction</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Don&#39;t think I would change anything about this set (beyond the stickers!).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Lackluster... but aren&#39;t most of the city minifigures</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The tracks are very tedious and time consuming but make the set!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Can&#39;t say enough how cool the dozer is!!! Everything else is just bonus.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Set is great. Only complaint is the price. Nearly 25% of the pieces are the tracks. It skews the price per piece a little. Not a $40 set. I got it at TRU for $26 on sale which made this set an absolute steal.&nbsp;</p>

"auriga","2016-07-02T13:27:27.303Z","A big, bad, yellow machine!","<p>One of the first things I did when I got out of my dark ages was browse for potential purchases. The moment I saw this set I knew I had to have it! It just looked big and mean and was sure to stand out in my collection. Well, I finally bought it, and here&#39;s my experience with it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a taped box which is sure to please box collectors. The front shows the bulldozer bursting through some structure while the female worker is pushing the wheelbarrow along; interestingly the bulldozer is shown destroying the structure from&nbsp;<em>the inside</em>. The back of the box shows some vignettes depicting the set in more angles and showing off its many features and accessories. The function of the chain at the rear is not demonstrated, but I believe it can be used to pull on the more stubborn parts of a structure.&nbsp;There is also no image showing the size of the finished product. Inside you get three numbered bags and a small sticker sheet.</p>

<p>The build process is aided by two instruction booklets. The first covers bags 1 and 2 and details the construction of the male minifigure,&nbsp;chassis, cab, and engine. The second booklet covers bag 3 and details the construction of the female minifigure, bulldozer blade, part of the condemned structure, and the rest of the accessories.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>What&#39;s kind of surprising about this relatively large set is how unsubstantial the inventory feels. The parts count is dominated by at least 84 track tread pieces and quite a number of&nbsp;large plates. Yellow is clearly the dominant color, with the other colors pretty much adding up the same. Perhaps of note are the two sets of function elements&nbsp;with the female halves molded in yellow.</p>

<p>I think the most interesting parts are the accessories. You get two bundles of dynamite with printed pieces used for the timer, a wheelbarrow, a jackhammer, and an exaggerated sledgehammer with a comically long shaft.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures are included, a male and female. The female comes in orange coveralls with reflective stripes that are worn over a grey hoodie. Her brown hair is molded together with a red hardhat, and her face shows a simple smile with her teeth showing (she must find demolition work very fulfilling). She doesn&#39;t come with any ear protection, so it&#39;s weird how the official set picture depicts her manning the jackhammer; she&#39;s a bad example, children. The male minifig&nbsp;has sand blue legs and an earth blue button-down with a harness. He comes with a red hardhat with ear protection molded together, and his face shows that he&#39;s in a bit of a tough situation; it&#39;s either (1) the building he&#39;s destroying is putting up a fight&nbsp;(2) it&#39;s really hot inside the bulldozer or (3) he&#39;s holding it in until 60073 Service Truck arrives (so sorry I opted to get the garbage truck instead; you&#39;ll have to tolerate it for a few months). Jokes aside, while both minifigs&nbsp;feature printing on the backs of their torsos&nbsp;neither one has any&nbsp;on their legs or arms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve nothing bad to say about the included minifigs. While I don&#39;t find anything spectacular about either of them they are solid, well-executed minifigs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I mentioned earlier&nbsp;the build is divided across three bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag one builds the chassis of the bulldozer. It consists mainly of sizeable parts, such as bricks, plates, and Technic beams. One thing that immediately stands out is how incredibly rigid the chassis is; not only are the bricks held together by plates from the top and bottom but 4 3m Technic axles are used as reinforcement. There are 42 track tread pieces on either side of the chassis, and these are driven by 3 sprockets on each side, with the central sprockets connected to two&nbsp;hidden wheels with rubber tires which help turn the sprockets on surfaces where the treads do not have traction; it should also be pointed out that this set uses the smaller 15379 chain piece as opposed to the significantly larger 88323 track element that Lego usually uses for vehicles of this type and scale. There are two things of note with the tread mechanism. First, the hidden tires are connected to the chassis on separate axles and are located at the center of the entire assembly; this causes an interesting effect which I will discuss later. Second, the treads hardly have any slack&nbsp;and in fact push the outermost sprockets, which are connected via separate pins,&nbsp;at an angle; this means that the treads are not perfectly straight <s>but nonetheless are able to rotate freely</s>. EDIT: No, the treads do not rotate freely; more on this later.</p>

<p>Bag two builds the cab as well,&nbsp;the front of the bulldozer which represents the cowling for the engine, and the ripper. This is also where all but one of the stickers are supposed to be used.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unlike bag one the construction is much more straightforward and basic. The cab uses two antennas to represent controls and has enough room for a seat. Despite the basic construction the engine cowling looks very convincing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, bag three builds the bulldozer blade and the condemned structure. The clamp and slope pieces are used to great effect in the blade; despite being built around a 6x12 plate it is a very convincing-looking blade. The blade is connected to the tractor via the function elements and two 11m Technic beams. The condemned structure, represented by a small corner with a door, is a simple and straightforward build that makes use of grille pieces and 1x4 plates with 2 knobs at the base of the walls for easy &quot;destruction.&quot;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Oh&nbsp;wow.&nbsp;For&nbsp;its&nbsp;price&nbsp;point&nbsp;and&nbsp;parts&nbsp;count&nbsp;the&nbsp;bulldozer&nbsp;is&nbsp;huge&nbsp;though&nbsp;it&nbsp;admittedly&nbsp;looks smaller in person. One thing that I immediately noticed is how out of proportion it looks compared to other City trucks, but I feel that this is a minor issue as its massiveness makes it look ready to tackle just about any demolition job. It is well-detailed that one could easily leave out the stickers. My only real complaint about its appearance is the use of the 11m Technic beams in the blade mechanism, although this can easily be remedied using a combination of other Technic parts.</p>

<p>The ripper looks really nice&nbsp;but its inclusion is mostly cosmetic. You can&#39;t really use it to rip structures apart because the angle and material of the dorsal fin parts would&nbsp;make the ripper slide off first before any destruction can take place.</p>

<p>I really like the blade!&nbsp;Aside from its construction which I already discussed, the assembly has sufficient friction care of the function elements and two Technic pins. In fact, depending on how you angle the blade (which you can do thanks to the cylindrical joints of the function elements), the bulldozer can hold it up vertically. The only thing that would make it even better would be 2x2 plates with frictioned vertical snaps - which, correct me if I am wrong, do not exist yet.</p>

<p>Another feature I really like was one I had not expected. Remember the independently connected hidden wheels? Their location at the very center of the chassis creates a differential effect when turning the bulldozer. This means that if you turn the bulldozer then the treads inside the turn with mostly stay stationary while the treads outside the turn will rotate. This might not be a novel feature but it&#39;s still a simple mechanism that I am very pleased with.</p>

<p>EDIT: I played with it a bit more and discovered that contrary to my initial observation the track treads DO NOT rotate freely due to the lack of slack. To get them to rotate one will have to push down on the bulldozer; simply pushing it from the back/pulling it from the front will not be enough for the mechanism to overcome the lack of slack/compression on the Technic pins connecting the sprockets. I found this a bit annoying, but nonetheless I still stand by my previous conclusion about the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have nothing bad to say about this set. It is everything I hoped for it to be the moment I learned of its existence. It&#39;s easily my favorite Lego set ever, and I have a hard time imagining what could top it.</p>

<p>In terms of price I say this is a sweet deal. I will admit that I paid over 50 USD for it, and even taking into account the exorbitant prices of Lego here in the Philippines I feel that I made a really good purchase. I cannot recommend this set enough.</p>
