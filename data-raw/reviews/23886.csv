"mini_mads1980","2014-12-30T16:05:55.5Z","Great set for play","<p>This is the first of the 2015 City&nbsp;sets I have purchased.&nbsp; It cost &pound;17.99, which is the retail price.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Initial thoughts of the new 2015 design is that Lego have made an improvement.&nbsp; The border is crisp and the image of the set is clear and shows the Pickup with a broken down blue car attached to the back, and a rather happy driver despite the problem with his vehicle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The image on the top of the box shows the two Minifigures that come with the set, with the Mechanic as the 1:1 scale image.&nbsp; The two sides are the same image as the front of the box and the back has the Mechanic as the Hey! image in the top-right and five pictures that show a story of the car losing a wheel and then being attached to the truck.</p>

<p>Inside the box there are three numbered bags, two instruction booklets, a sticker sheet with 12 stickers and a large vehicle plate for the Pickup.</p>

<p>Instruction Book 1 builds the blue car and driver.&nbsp; Instruction Book 2 builds the Pickup and the Mechanic, it also includes&nbsp;images of five new sets (including this one) and four of the 2014 sets as well as the parts list.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No new parts appear to be in the set, and what parts are present are pretty much standard in similar sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The car driver is a smart member of the public with a green pullover and a pair of trousers.&nbsp; The mechanic has a beard and glasses and is in the standard overalls with printed tools in his pocket.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The car only takes a couple of minutes to put together in 18 steps.&nbsp; There is nothing that is going to surprise anyone in the construction, and it reminds me of one of the cars from the garage / car park (4207)&nbsp;that was released a couple of years ago with a few minor differences.&nbsp; Once built there are only two transparent parts left.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first part of the Pickup is built in thirty-two stages at the start of the second booklet.&nbsp; It takes a little over five minutes to put together and builds the base of the vehicle.&nbsp; The second part (steps 33 to 47) also takes a bit over five minutes to build.&nbsp; The construction of the arm is nice, however there is nothing too taxing.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model has a nice playability about it, but it is lacking in a couple of areas for me.&nbsp; Other models, such as 60017, 7638 and 60056 all have opening doors to the cab but this set does not.&nbsp; The roofs of the vehicles are removable but this little aspect takes something away for me.&nbsp; Also, the green cheeses on the side of the Pickup have an nasty gap between them, which could have been improved.</p>

<p>A slightly strange thing is the 2x2 with 1 stud that sits in the back of the Pickup to hold the fire extinguisher.&nbsp; This may be to hold the arm of the Pickup in place, however it seems sturdy enough without it, so not sure why it is there.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like the look of the set, and I am sure kids will have hours of play with the set.&nbsp; The inclusion of the car makes it more playable than 60056 as a standalone set.</p>

"redbeardlegoman","2015-07-21T03:40:57.167Z","Great Tow Truck and Bonus Car!","<p>This was one the those sets that I initially thought, &quot;I&#39;ll probably get it, because I&#39;m a completist&nbsp;nut.&quot; &nbsp;After I built it, however, I was quite delighted by it, and will probably come to put in on my favourites list.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I never really have much to say about boxes and instructions. &nbsp;I toss the boxes that I don&#39;t use as scrap cardboard. &nbsp;I always think they should be smaller, too. &nbsp;And it&#39;s good to have instructions, though I always think that more steps could be incorporated on each page.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I like that the trend continues to use Technic parts to add more function and playability to the sets. &nbsp;The towing arm while simple, does the job well, and I think it has an elegance in its simplicity. &nbsp;I like that functionality comes with&nbsp;an economy of pieces. &nbsp;It also doesn&#39;t make the mechanism overly clunky. &nbsp;If I had to point out one flaw, and it&#39;s very minor, it&#39;s that the lower hook portion is a bit floppy. &nbsp;I imagine that in a real truck, that would be stiffer and more secure. &nbsp;But, like I said, it&#39;s a minor thing.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t normally have much to say about stickers, positive or negative, I really like the sticker on the hood of the truck. &nbsp;I think it&#39;s a catchy and well-executed piece of graphic art. The off-centre&nbsp;green stripe and cluster of stars, to my mind, give hints of the personality of the driver or owner of the towing company. &nbsp;I do hope to see more of this kind of realism in the future.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are perhaps generic, but that&#39;s fine. &nbsp;I think the artistry of the set really comes from the vehicals&nbsp;anyway. &nbsp;Sure it&#39;s always nice to get new minifigures, or at least new parts. &nbsp;But at the same time, if it keeps the cost lower, and allows me to more easily buy a different set, or a good variation on a theme, then I&#39;m all for it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t tricky. &nbsp;But I don&#39;t really expect much challenge from City sets. &nbsp;What I do enjoy, however, from set to set are the small variations, or different approaches to the same solutions. &nbsp;The hood of the blue car could have easily been just a single hood piece. &nbsp;But instead, it achieves a different look by using four pieces. &nbsp;In the real world, cars are all basically car shaped, and the styling that sets them apart comes from exploring that same kind of variation on a theme. &nbsp;I find that delightful.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like the blue car. &nbsp;It&#39;s good to have another automobile to add to my city. &nbsp;And I think it&#39;s wonderful to get a car with a tow truck set. &nbsp;It makes it more playable immediately. &nbsp;If this were a child&#39;s first set, they could play out a little scene right away, instead of having a great tow truck with no cars to assist.<br />
<br />
The truck, however, is great. &nbsp;It&#39;s a solid, stable build in relatively few, well-used parts. &nbsp;My daughter can push it along the floor, in her enthusiasm, without all the parts falling off all the time. &nbsp;The proportions of it compared to the accompanying car make it look like a powerful, dependable working vehicle. &nbsp;The hood sticker gives it a human touch I can&#39;t help but find endearing. &nbsp;The proportions are good. &nbsp;It might not be a showcase piece, like a big old starship or castle, but I could see it sitting proudly on a shelf as that quietly excellent design I could envy the creator for.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For the price you get two vehicals and two minifigures. &nbsp;You get a great tow truck, and a nice little car to rescue. &nbsp;Playable and able to take the exuberance of a toddler, it also looks good displayed on a shelf in any proud collection. &nbsp;I&#39;d say if you were going to get any City set this year, this is the sleeper hit. &nbsp;It&#39;s going to grow on you, like it did on me.</p>

"andyh1984","2016-08-19T19:44:26.91Z","Nicer than it looks on the box","<p>I had spotted this at a reduced price and wasn&#39;t sure about it but when I went back it was further reduced so I bought&nbsp;it, I am glad I did as its a nice set but the RRP seems a little high to&nbsp;me.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>standard city box showing model and play features.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing spectacular though the stickers for the truck are visually very eyecatching</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 male minifigures,&nbsp;man with a&nbsp;green jumper over blue shirt with light tan legs and the bearded, bespectacled&nbsp;tow truck driver with dark blue overalls over a light blue shirt wearing a blue baseball cap</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The car is built first and is quite basic, the truck has&nbsp;a little more building &nbsp;involved, the whole set took me 40 leisurely minutes including applying stickers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks nice, the truck catches the eye with its colour scheme and graphics and the towing function works well for its simplicity.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like it but not enough to spend &pound;17.99 on it but its a good set and a nice playscene for any child.</p>
