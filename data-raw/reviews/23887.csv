<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard fare by now. Easy to follow instructions despite all the vehicles being built brick by brick.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>At 222 parts the set is a pretty good deal. The best part is some of those parts do not feel all that common. The golden hub caps on the truck and the bright yellow caps on the buggy in particular are highlights. The hair piece and head piece are nothing new and we get a wrench thrown in for good measure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 typical city-fare figures are included but they are nice. They fit the theme well and are well printed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is nothing too fancy but for builder used to getting a carriage to build a car on top of will find both of these vehicles are brick built. So they take a bit to construct as they must be build from the ground up with plates and bricks. Some specialty pieces like the external exhaust on the buggy and the long antenna piece are included so you can definitely find lots of uses for alternate vehicle builds later.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished piece looks great! The buggy on the hitch is awesome and the bed on the truck can serve as a passenger seat when the buggy is not in use. Both cars have fairly large tires for their type and are pretty sturdy. The golden hub caps on the truck in particular make it really stand out! Fun to play with on its own and has a lot of weight to it. The only pieces that come flying off of it are the front bumper plate and the antenna which is held by a single stud but those can be removed when having a serious crash session. The buggy is very sturdy and looks classic with the stickers rounding out the styling and giving it some color contrast. Very nice.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Two cars and two figures! Plenty of racing play to be had with this set. Plus the pieces allow for a mish mash of cars to be built in either color. Very good recreational theme for any City builder and a good set for kids just looking for a nice open topped jeep like truck and a race buggy.&nbsp;</p>
