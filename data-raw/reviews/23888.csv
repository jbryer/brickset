"T_Lars","2015-01-05T04:29:29.813Z","That name again is Mr. Plow.","<p>When I first saw the initial list of City vehicles for 2015, one immediately caught my eye; a snowplow!&nbsp;Having lived my entire life in a region of the world where the winters are oftentimes unbearably cold and snow is in the forecast five months out of the year, snowplows are a common sight on our roads. There has, however,&nbsp;been an unfortunate lack of these vehicles produced by LEGO, so to see a vehicle such as this was a welcomed addition to the lineup of &quot;great vehicles&quot; for myself. Not only that, but it is nice to see something outside of tow trucks, ambulances and... street light service trucks (?) we seem to get every year. So, appropriately&nbsp;&nbsp;on this -5 degree&nbsp;night I have decided to build and review it.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Size wise, the box is in line with the other Great Vehicles. Standard layout with the City logo in the upper left corner next to the LEGO brand logo. The main picture on the front is our snow plow looking big and beefy in front of a snow covered cityscape with the driver in front of the vehicle. As I am writing this review, this set is listed in&nbsp;Brickset&#39;s database as &quot;Snowplough&nbsp;Truck&quot;. However,&nbsp;my box (purchased here in the US) has the set named as &quot;Snowplow Truck&quot;, right above the piece count. This leads me to believe the name of this set could&nbsp;vary depending on region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The piece count is listed as 196, seems like a good amount but I would say that it is a bit misleading (more on that below). Pieces of interest (for myself, anyway) are the orange canopy parts used for the blade, the orange angled parts that make up the hopper and flat 1x1 round pieces in white. Lots of transparent red, orange and clear are used through out.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Just a single driver with parts we have seen before, but that&#39;s fine. He looks the part with his&nbsp;bluework&nbsp;jacket and baseball cap.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build is split between two bags. No revolutionary building techniques are used but you hardly ever get that with a City vehicle set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>To me, this set looks bigger and more detailed than it&#39;s piece count would suggest, although&nbsp;that could be due to the big chunky tires. Something else to bear in mind is that 15 of the total pieces are 1x1&nbsp;round&nbsp;flat white tiles used to simulate snow. Factoring that and the fact that you have a&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;and the ever present coffee mug, the piece count of the vehicle itself is 176.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks&nbsp;pretty impressive when you consider that most of the other Great Vehicle sets have piece counts above 200. I&#39;m really happy the cab is green while the rest of the truck is orange, it has a nice contrast and would have looked extremely bland if the whole thing was done in a single color scheme. It also helps it to stand out from all the orange construction vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>It would have been nice to have an actual seat for the driver to sit on, instead he just sits on the floor of the cab.&nbsp;Also the&nbsp;blade is attached to the front with a ball and socket connection, which works just fine but looks a little weak for an instrument used to push tons of snow. While its nice to have so many of the 1x1 round flat tiles in white, it sort of feels like filler to me.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&#39;d certainly recommend this set for just about anyone. A fantastic addition to the Great Vehicle lineup and really no city maintenance stable is complete without a snowplow.... unless your city is in a perpetual sunny summer.</p>

<p>Standard CITY fare here. &nbsp;Includes one instruction manual about half a sheet a paper in size 84 pages long.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Purchased this for 15.99 at Target, about eight cents each. &nbsp;MSRP is 19.99 makes each piece ten cents per piece. &nbsp;The tires style, look great but have the &quot;shaved&quot; look on the inner side. &nbsp;Green&#39;s always nice, like the orange plates, plow pieces are cool. &nbsp;The variation of the green and orange with light bluish gray accent pieces is excellent.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One, standard-type&nbsp;CITY worker with goatee. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Relatively quick and enjoyable. &nbsp;It has a compact yet&nbsp;bulky&nbsp;attitude to it when finished. &nbsp;As a previous interviewer&nbsp;noted, the plow attachment to the truck does seem skimpy, but it works. &nbsp;There&#39;s the typical sticker set I chose not to apply.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very nice! &nbsp;Really do like this truck/model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Giving it five stars because of the great color selection, parts, completed look.&nbsp;</p>
