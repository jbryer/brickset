As it turns out it&#39;s not just the outside of the bike that&#39;s new. The set as a whole is ok but it drops a few points.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a typical City box with all the regular items on it. Apparently I&#39;m 30+ years too old for this set; it&#39;s only for the 5-12 age range. The instructions come in two booklets and are clearly aimed at the lower end of that age range and are really easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The highlight of the set are of course the new motorbikes. The base/chassis for the bikes is a new part this year and the fairings will not fit on the old one.</p>

<p>There are no other unique parts; the car base is used often as is the windscreen. This is however only the fourth set since 2003 that used the small black doors.</p>

<p>There are no printed parts, apart from the minifig torso&#39;s and the windscreens of the bikes. The stickers on the bike fairings are particularly hard to put on. Our 5 year old builder might want to ask their mammy or daddy for help.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two minifigures in the set and their torso&#39;s are the same. The heads have been used in dozens of City sets before; one with a cheeky grin and one with silver shades.</p>

<p>They have the same red cap but their helmets are in different colours; one red and one black. Unfortunately the helmets are plain.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As you would expect from a set aimed at 5 year old builders it&#39;s all very straightforward; big car base, few layers of bricks and plates, grille/bumper section built separately and attached to a snot brick at the front. There&#39;s an interesting use of a mudguard part in step 7; the kind of thing most people wouldn&#39;t think of when building their model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The car is a very American looking pickup, something like a Ford F150. I&#39;m not mad about the angle of the back of the cab but other than that it&#39;s a good looking truck. It&#39;s got a ramp for loading a bike that slides in under the floor of the bed. So far so good.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are some issues. The trailer is rather poor; it&#39;s a 4x10 plate on wheels. Like most similar sets, there are two minifigs but only one will fit in the cab. The design of the back of the cab isn&#39;t great; using an angled windscreen rather than a flat window and there&#39;s a gap left open at the top. Most of these won&#39;t affect the target audience but there&#39;s one issue that will: The helmets don&#39;t attach to the space guns meant to hold them so they&#39;ll fall off in play.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a good looking set with a lot of play options but it&#39;s let down by some details. I&#39;d happily do without the podium and trophy to get some of the issues with the truck resolved.</p>

<p>Still, I&#39;d happily recommend this set. And at &euro;20 for a truck with trailer, two minifigs and two bikes it&#39;s pretty decent value for money.</p>
