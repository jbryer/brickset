"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-21T01:15:26Z","ow.....","its in the end of that level but you can't build and play with it in the game: you only can walk to it

"smiley905","2007-12-30T18:08:41.45Z","great set","i love this set. it is well designed but could still use some improvements.

PROS'S
pics up the car or bin
lots of boulders
speeder in the back
is held together well
cool cocpit

CON'S

no rock giant

i made a lot of modefacations to mine, and i like it a lot better, but its great how it is. i was thinking of giving it a five, but i think it could have looked just a bit better, but still very close

"Rgijaba","2008-01-09T20:49:35.217Z","the biggest of all air vecles, and lagest vecle all together.","this set is awsome and is worthy of a more than perfest six. it comes with jet and docs, two dinamites, a small digger, a green energy crystle, and a ore.the bin and small digger can be picked up by the tunle transport, and it even has an escape mini speeder! it has a cool comic, and is far worthy of being the best set of 1999! overall, get it if you like rock raiders, need some ore or green crystles, or are bored and need some thing to play with on rainy days.buy five today!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"dragon_teenager","2009-04-19T00:06:36.293Z","One of the best sets I've ever purchased ","Rock Raiders is possibly one of my favorite LEGO themes, and the Tunnel Transport epitomizes the Rock Raiders design. It's build like a rock, comes with a ton of accessories, great printed parts, and some nice minifigs. I'll keep it simple with a pro-con list: 

= PROS =

- Solid, sturdy construction

- An abundance of useful parts, like brown propellers and printed tiles

- Great play factor: the Transport is a joy to swoosh around the room

- The center holding bay magnetically latches onto either a modified crate or a truck 

- Includes a rear docking bay for a small scooter

- Tons of accessories

- Very detailed look: rear lights, frontal floodlights, air vents, landing pads, hoses and more

- Two awesome minifigs

- The mini truck it comes with is actually quite strong for an obligatory small vehicle. The back will serve as a dump truck and the overall look is quite good. 

- Comes with some neat bombs and rocks

- Great display piece 


= CONS =

- One more minifig wouldn't have hurt. 

- The turquoise color seems a little out of place, however this is a criticism you could make against Rock Raiders in general

- Smaller attachments, like the antennae and floodlights, fall off a lot. 


Overall this set is quite strong and I'd strongly recommend it to any 90s child or LEGO fan in general! I was highly satisfied with my purchase and I think you will be too. It has useful parts, great playability, great display factor, and great minifigs- what else could a LEGO fan ask for?

A well deserved 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-23T18:03:49.67Z","It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's PLASTIC!","Wow this is an awesome set, well worth the $40 it is to buy. The massive futuristic helecopter (not at all fragile) is really well designed and has too much playability to speak of (so give it to some other set [just kidding]), it makes us all feel bad we only used it in one level!

The ship includes a magnetic cargo system capable of lifting the Small Digger or the large cargo bucket (but if the top magnet holder isn't inserted tightly it can fall off, also if it is put on in the wrong direction, the magnet's slight swinging also makes it come off). The ship has plenty off tools, accessories, just enough minifigures, a detachable scout ship in the back, four rotors (rather that one or two), a Small Digger (straight from the game!), two rocks (each with a crystal), and two dynamite units (also from the game). The layout of the tools is cool (especially the twin buzzsaws), and the sturdy construction (though the four pads often come off when building) make it a great model.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-28T11:37:28.71Z","LEGO Rock Raiders - The Tunnel Transport Review","Now this set is a cool set to have. It's one of the 'must have' sets and it comes with lot's of cool pieces. Some of them are really rare. You won't have to worry about stickers and the set is very sturdy. It's a long built but it's an easy one. The only thing I have to complain about this model is that this set only comes with 2 minifigs. I think it should have included one or two more minifigs so that every place can be used. The cockpit of this helicopter comes with a nice roll cage piece (which is a rare piece to this theme) and a cool dashboard with two computer screens. I also like the back where you can hide a speeder for the minifigs. You'll also find a big container with a magnet which can be attached to the helicopter. This container includes two sticks of dynamite, two rocks which both have a crystal in it. You also get a driller vehichle which also has a magnet which attaches to the helicopter. This set is a lot of fun to play with and I think it's a good set to have.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"EtudeTheBadger","2010-03-28T16:41:22.75Z","Movin' Loads","<p>The Tunnel Transport is the workhorse of the Rock Raiders fleet. Not an undeserved reputation for the vehicle that is also the most awesome. Roaring high and lifting just about anything, from ferrying small vehicles to rescuing Rock Raiders from flows of boiling lava, what's not to like?<br />
And, er, oh, did I also mention the Rock Raiders modelled the Transport after the 'Melalanian Musk Weasel'? That explains its four-legged shape.</p>
<p>Okay, so I installed that last little factoid.</p>
<p>The build is an amazing yet so simple experience. The Transport is made of blocky parts that comprise a surprisingly impressive structure, and the details are super. The rotor blades are mounted on outriggers, allowing the Transport to hover and manoevre, and comm aerials are affixed to the frontal landing legs to allow any transmissions to reach base. LEGO really outfitted this thing with the right gear.</p>
<p>The set also features a Small Digger, an underpowered but oft-used vehicle in the Rock Raiders fleet. The little wheeler can be picked up by the Transport by way of a great magnet system, as can a large bucket also featured. You never know when you'll have to dump a load of water across a lava stream... or transport a bit of ore. Docs and Jet are the team in command of the expedition this time.</p>
<p>An amazing bit of machinery. And an amazing set.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Great vehicle</li>
    <li>Well equipped</li>
    <li>Digger included</li>
    <li>Cool figures</li>
    <li>More Crystals and Ore</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>None at all</li>

    <li>HUGE for 1999</li>
    <li>Minifigs (Jet and Docs)</li>

    <li>Another person, maybe Sparks, would have been nice</li>
    <li>No rock monster</li>
    <li>Other than that, it is perfect!</li>
