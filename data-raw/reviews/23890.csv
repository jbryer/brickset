<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A few booklets tell you how to put together each set by theme. Nothing fancy but the instructions are simple to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>242 parts all of them varied with some nice accessories to be had for those looking to boost their city population or accessory count. 2 medical injection pieces, one med kit (sticker required to complete the look) 3 life preservers, a crow bar and various helmets really add to the mini figure parts counts and are accessories I had been hunting for a bit. Note the life preservers are the more recent type that leave a bit of a visible&nbsp;gap between the head and torso piece.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>5 minifigures come bundled with this set and all of them look great. The police officer has a nice blue cap on and also has a tactical vest print. The crook has a mask printed on his face and looks devious. The firefighters come with one male and one female and have nice prints on their suits with some silvery parts shining when the lights hits them just right. The EMT pilot has a nice full red flight suit with very nice details printed on the torso.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Each build is very simple. The rigid hull craft being the simplest of the 5 vehicles included in this set. In fact, each build on its own is not that complicated. The only one that raised the bar slightly was the medical helicopter. It has a few cylindrical pieces that serve as floats (won&#39;t actually float though) and it is connected to the chassis with some technic holes it seems.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Each model looks great on its own. The Police ATV rolls to and fro very well as it has bigger tires than the normal sedans released during this time period. The same goes for its trailer. The Fire boat looks very bland though. Even with the stickers it just isn&#39;t carrying much in terms of gear to make it look more interesting. The small rigid hull craft can be customized a few ways if you do not set it a light with the fire pieces. The helicopter is by far the more interesting model with it being amphibious and having a nice pair of storage compartments for the medical equipment and a place for the strecher.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A pretty good set for children graduating from simpler sets and looking to expand into the City theme. A nice selection of figures and accessories lend themselves well for varied play. Though that may come at the cost of some of the less interesting bits (according to taste) going unused.&nbsp;</p>
