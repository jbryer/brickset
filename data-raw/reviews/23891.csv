<p>The headpiece isn&#39;t new, but a nice recoloring. The black headphones work better than the previous silver and the dark brown hair adds some variety.</p>

<p>I am unsure on if gamers actually wear shirts that say Player 1 on it, but I like the addition of the new molded two color sleeves. That certainly adds another layer to this figure.</p>

<p>The video game controller looks superb. It couldn&#39;t be any better outside of it being molded to have a designated shape. Although I prefer the 1x2 tile being used because it takes into account the older NES controller, but with the newer flair of joysticks and colored buttons.</p>

<p>I only bought one of him, but I could see wanting more, just for the pieces for different figures.</p>

<p>I would recommend picking one up if you can find him at a good price. Some of the individual pieces go for more than expected.</p>

<p>This Minifigure represents your standard Game Player, male of course, the female game player is bound to show up in a future series. The legs have great printing for fans of blue jeans, and his torso has a fun printed short sleeved shirt over top of another shirt, as demonstrated by the two toned arms being used here. I believe they are double molded with two separate colours. His facial expression is fun and looks good, and his hairpiece is the DJ hairpiece, complete with permanently attached headphones for online game chatting sessions. The accessory is a 1x2 tile printed with a game controller image.</p>

<p>Not a bad looking accessory, however I feel we missed out on a prime opportunity for a newly sculpted game controller piece better suited for minifigure hands. It&#39;s hard to imagine any gamer using such a clunky looking controller. A vintage 80s style joystick might have been nice to see, and as a bonus has many different uses.</p>

<p>Overall not a bad minifugre, the parts are useful and desirable, if you don&#39;t already own one I recommend tracking him down.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-21T23:04:28.443Z","a hard-core GAMER!","<p>Series 12 has some amazing characters, one of which is the Video Game Guy, who includes 6 parts. He, along with the rest of the series, released in October 2014, where they&nbsp;were part of the first unlicensed series to cost 4 bucks.</p>

<p>Atop the character is a hair-piece that incorporates headphones. Though it may appear otherwise, that part wasn&#39;t new to the figure, but rather, it was recoloured from the Series 8 DJ. I&#39;m impressed at how well that mould fits this character, and it looks fantastic in dark brown. The black headphones are printed, rather than dual-moulded. Another detail I appreciate is the extensive moulding surrounding it.</p>

<p>This character&#39;s head print is freaking useful! We rarely get generic minifigures with glasses, so that obviously makes me like this figure a lot more. He has a chipper smile, but he lacks alternate printing, which is expected from a 2014 CMF.</p>

<p>The Video Game Guy&#39;s torso sports an excellent print! I wish later in the CMF line we would&#39;ve got a &quot;player 2&quot; shirt, but oh well. Nonetheless, this is yet again a highly useful piece! He lacks back printing, but it isn&#39;t very glaring, since his dual-moulded arms cover detail at the back. Speaking of which, this is the first figure in&nbsp;the series to have dual-coloured arms! The top is done in black, while the bottom is done in grey, which nicely captures a two-toned design.</p>

<p>This character doesn&#39;t even need it, but he has some very detailed legs! They&#39;re incredibly useful outside the setting, and I love the key-ring that has a small USB drive. As someone who frequently uses USB&#39;s, this is great to get. Plus, the sand blue colour it&#39;s caste in does a sick job capturing denim jeans.</p>

<p>His accessory is a video game controller, which is obviously fitting as heck. I won&#39;t lie; it looks a little strange being flat and 2-demensional, but it certainly doesn&#39;t look bad. It looks like it may be based on either an Xbox or a PlayStation remote, considering its dual joy-cons and ABXY buttons. The D-pad is a fantastic and accurate touch as well. I really love this accessory!</p>

<p>Overall, Video Game Guy has got to be one of my favourites of the series, but then again, there are a lot of solid figures found in this set. He&#39;s an easy 5 out of 5 for me!</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review, folks! Thanks for reading!</p>
