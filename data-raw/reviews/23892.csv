<p>The Pizza Delivery Man includes simple single sided torso printing with a few grease stains and a shirt collar. He also has dual molded arms for the short-sleeved look. There is no leg printing on the dark blue pants, and the facial expression looks pretty good, because it also features braces and freckles a rare sight on facial expressions.</p>

<p>Accessories include a 1x4 tile with a printed pizza box and a 1x4 round tile printed with a new pizza topping. LEGO Pizzas are common, this print however is brand new with pepperoni and cheese and greens. It&#39;s a lot more detailed than the pizza pieces from LEGO City sets. He also comes with the baseball cap printed with a Pizza slice and the word pizza.</p>

<p>Overall with the dual molded torso for the arms I&#39;d definitely say this is a great figure that can be hunted down if you missed it and the parts are useful for populating LEGO City displays. Recommended, especially as the pizza print is a new design.</p>

<p>Okay, I adore his &quot;pizza&quot; hat, because not only does it have an adorable piece of pizza at the front, but it&#39;s the hat mould that does not have a hole at the top, and I prefer that version.</p>

<p>His head print is honestly one of my favourite parts of the figure. It&#39;s useful for male and female characters alike, and the freckles around his braces are adorable. It&#39;s a perfect expression, honestly.</p>

<p>The torso print here is useful as heck, with its red and white collar, and there are two grease spots on the shirt, which I think adds to the personality of this figure. He lacks back printing, but the dual-moulded arms make up for it, since they were a relatively new idea.</p>

<p>The legs do not have printing, but they use a darker tone of blue that resemble&nbsp;jeans nicely. Where this figure shines the most to me is with his two accessories. The pizza box uses a 2x2 tile that literally says &quot;pizza.&quot; The 2x2 round tile that is a pizza is caste in a dark tan that looks WAY better than LEGO&#39;s typical peach colour. Cheese, pepperoni, and mushrooms are printed on the surface, which is more than what&#39;s normally on a LEGO pizza.</p>

<p>Overall, like most others in this series, this is such an amazing figure. He&#39;s an easy 5 out of 5 points for me.</p>
