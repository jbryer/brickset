<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The typical Minifigures&nbsp;packet for S12 is used. The pamphlet has an ad for LEGO Minifigures Online, instead of the instructions sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This one has some interesting parts. Most notable is her hairpiece, in a style we&#39;ve surprisingly never seen before. Beware, it is rubber, but that makes it an excellent giveaway when feeling bags.&nbsp;She has a dark grey basic skirt, and a new print for the teddy bear. The skirt was a little looser on her; the way I put it on, one side frequently rotates out of alignment, but is easily pushed back.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was simple, like every minifigure&#39;s, with the skirt being the most complicated part. I put it on with the slit at the back, but it&#39;s only an aesthetic preference.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(68, 68, 68);"">The Spooky Girl is terrific.&nbsp;Completely&nbsp;black-and-white since she&#39;s partially based off of&nbsp;<em>The Addams Family</em>, she&#39;s&nbsp;subtly creepy. Her long straight hair with bangs is somewhat similar to the Ginny Weasley hair, but it&#39;s completely straight with bangs. Her head has a slight frown and sunken-looking eyes. She wears a skirt and suit&nbsp;that somewhat resembles an academy uniform (she is also based on a creepy&nbsp;schoolgirl as one might see in Japanese horror culture) with a dark gray spider in her pocket. Her legs are detailed, with black underpants and multi-striped black-and-white leggings which continue to the sides of the legs. Due to her age as a young girl who could be in her early teens, her &quot;curves&quot; printing is minimal and only of the waist variety, which I appreciate.&nbsp;Her teddy bear is black with a white belly and white&nbsp;stripes that match her leggings. The bear has a white muzzle and a stitched frown. His printing indicates that he&nbsp;had&nbsp;two button eyes, but&nbsp;one was lost. He&#39;s adorably spooky, and fits with her perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this one. She&#39;s &nbsp;ambiguous enough that she could apply to a number of spooky situations, but a cohesive story could be possibly be formed around her. She&#39;s just so well designed. Like Mr. Good and Evil before, she is residing with the creepy characters&nbsp;from previous series and Monster Fighters.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like that she&#39;s not over-the-top, but instantly you know she&#39;s creepy. This is my favorite Series 12 minifigure so far, and I highly recommend her.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>She comes in the usual blind CMF packet. This time, the checklist also serves as the instructions. The back of the checklist is an advertisement for the Minifig online game with a code to include this figure as playable. For those who have already opened other series of CMFs, the omission of instructions is fine. But for the first-timer, especially a child, there might be frustration with the skirt accessory without&nbsp;at least some aid&nbsp;(see below).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are two parts for Spooky Girl apart from the usual parts. First is the skirt accessory. This goes on just like other skirts of the past, such as the Ice Skater or the Series 12 companion Battle Goddess. My youngest son had a problem figuring out how to put on the skirt, since it was his first encounter with this accessory. But once he worked it out, no problems putting it onto the figure.</p>

<p>The second accessory is the bear, which is fantastic! It fits with the color and stripe theme of the girl, and also the mood; it is missing one eye and has a frown on its face, which fits perfectly with the stoic expression of the figure.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figure itself is interesting for some of its details. The hair is the more rubbery substance that we encounter occasionally in hair pieces and alien heads, and works fine here. The head has just the one expression - stoic (no angry face on the back - too bad!).</p>

<p>The body has a school uniform design with some nice touches, including&nbsp;a spider crawling out of the left pocket of her blazer. She also has striped sock printing on her legs as consistent with a uniform.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The only addition here is the skirt, which is fine.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final product looks just like it should according to the picture.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is an excellent example of the consistency in detail that a minifigure can have to create a mood or theme in itself. Spooky Girl on her own seems to have a story behind her that comes out in the details. This is an intriguing&nbsp;figure and a favorite of my two children (sons, even!).</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-02T18:08:38.237Z","Not Quite Wednesday, maybe closer to Tuesday","<p><strong>Set #71007 Spooky Girl: </strong>An awesome all black and white minifigure with shades of grey used well to accentuate the monochrome appearance of the figure.</p>

<p>She sadly only has a single sided torso print, however that print is fairly well designed with a nice black top buttoned up and a white undershirt visible, she&#39;s even got a spider crawling out of her pocket, I wonder if she called it Homer. (Old school Addams fan will know what I&#39;m talking about.) Her legs include black and white stocking print and her face has a nice monotone expression, the lengthy black hair and the battered black teddy bear with white and black striped tummy looks great. The cloth skirt piece is the weakest element and that&#39;s only because it tends to be frustrating to get it on and sit properly on the figure.</p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend this minifigure for fans of gothic and macabre characters. She looks great and her parts are also quite nice to mix and match new characters. Definitely one of the better offerings from Series 12.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-06T01:52:46.133Z","SPPOKILY DETAILED!","<p>The final figure to be found in LEGO Minifigures Series 12 is Spooky Girl. She, alongside the rest of the set, released in 2014 and retailed for 4 dollars. I love Series 12, so it&#39;s interesting to see this as the last of the set.</p>

<p>Starting from the top, we have that hairpiece that was made specifically for this figure. It looks splendid, and LEGO didn&#39;t even need to make a new mould for her, yet they did. I love the moulded detailing along the front, back, and even the top of that sculpt. Now some may not know this, but the entire hair is caste in soft rubber. I don&#39;t hate that, and I&#39;ve never had a problem with rubber pieces in LEGO, however I can understand some people&#39;s aversion, since it&#39;s more prone to being damaged.</p>

<p>As far as the head piece goes, it&#39;s an interesting colour choice, but I&#39;m not complaining. I like how disturbed she looks, since it matches the character (I&#39;ll probably never say that again!).</p>

<p>Her torso continues the muted colour scheme, which once again, looks great. She doesn&#39;t have back printing, but I love the spider in her pocket.</p>

<p>A cloth skirt is included, which I definitely appreciate. I prefer physical skirts over printed ones, since printed ones lack depth.</p>

<p>Man, her legs have some extremely impressive printing, and I adore that! The black and white stripes are excellent, and they&#39;re even carried onto her sides, which is so extra and fantastic!</p>

<p>Her accessory is a black teddy bear, which uses some exclusive printing that again, I love!</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this has got to be one of my favourites of the series. 5 out of 5!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review, thanks for reading!</p>
