He&nbsp;</span>might not be the best minifigure of the series, but I am not dissappointed either.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with all collectable minifigures, the parts are very detailed. But what stands out the most here is his helmet, armor and little driller &quot;gun&quot; that consists of 2 separate parts. The helmet is very detailed, with lamp at the top and some circuits exposed at the back. His armor has a nice detail which seems to be the space miners logo (a planet orbited by a driller) printed on the left shoulder pad (not visible on the picture). Both armor and gun have 2 additional connectors that can be used to enhance the figure even more with some extra parts. Armor also has 2 small bars where you can add those small cones and make it into some kind of jetpack. The figure comes with standard black stand.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The face is pretty detailed and all of its features are nicely visible through the helmet visor - the only bad thing about the visor is that it cannot be raised or lowered, but I guess you don&#39;t need that when you&#39;re in space! There are some printed details on the torso, but they get covered&nbsp;by the armor anyway. Legs are very detailed and there is a very small text on the hip that reads &quot;Licho&quot; which might be the guy&#39;s name I guess.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The &quot;space miner&quot; seems to be quite an original theme for a minifigure, however I imagine he would go quite well with sets from Rock Raiders or Power Miners. He looks good on the shelf and has a lot of gadgets and parts that could find other uses, so I am quite happy with the buy!</p>

"Sethro3","2015-07-28T16:34:41.93Z","Nothing is finer than this Miner..","<p>Another fine addition to the CMF. This particular one isn&#39;t my usual cup of tea, but he works well for what he is.</p>

<p>I really like the helmet. It has superb, crisp printing on it and the design/shape is well executed. I do hope to see it in other colors in the future. I&#39;m not that partial to orange (which is the primary reason he doesn&#39;t work for my collection).</p>

<p>The upper armor is very wanted/needed for MOCs/armies. Plus, the print on the side is well done.</p>

<p>The torso and legs are well printed, but a lot does get hidden by the armor. It&#39;s nice TLG included some under printing though. Sometimes they just have a blank torso underneath.</p>

<p>The gun in orange is peculiar, but it goes with the theme. The unicorn piece is always fun to find uses for.</p>

<p>I would recommend getting him. I&#39;d imagine he is easy to find at a reasonable price considering he wasn&#39;t that popular of a figure it seems.</p>

And as Space hasn&#39;t been around for a few years now in any memorable form we really only get to see new minifigures being added to their ranks through CMF.</p>

<p>This minifigure seems to have a name printed on his belt, LICHO, this could be the name of the figure or the name of the mining outfit he works for. Either way he&#39;s got a nice looking print, with&nbsp;a single-sided torso print and leg printing that looks like a very sturdy looking spacesuit in grey and orange. His bulky protective armour piece is very nicely sculpted and includes a variation on the Classic Space logo, with the familiar planet and line circling it adding a drill to the logo to indicate his profession.</p>

<p>His helmet piece is new, it includes some nicely sculpted details including a headlight to see in the dark recesses of the mines, and a bit of printing. He also features the standard space blaster piece with a Unikitty horn in grey to represent the drill tip. Rounding off the look of this figure is a nice looking facial print with an ear piece and communication microphone to talk to his bosses.</p>

<p>Overall this is a very fun looking Space minifig with excellent printing details and a great addition to any Classic Space collection. I&#39;d recommend at least grabbing a few of him if you missed out back when this series came out.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-24T14:35:53.07Z","MIND-BLOWING!","<p>The LEGO Minifigures theme always surprises me with its interesting and seemingly random choices. The Space Miner from Series 12 certainly falls in that catergory of weird choices, but that isn&#39;t always a bad thing. This series was released in 2014 where it retailed for 4 bucks a pop.</p>

<p>Right off the bat we get a brand new piece made specifically for this figure, that being his helmet. Gosh, it&#39;s detailed! I love the colour palette of yellow-orange, orange, and dark grey. I like the vent moulded into the front as well. Of course that transparent smoky-grey visor is a separate piece that snaps in using some small pegs on the sides.</p>

<p>Uderneath is a surprisingly useful face. It has a smile and a scruffy beard, but my favourite part about it is the microphone that connects to his ear. It doesn&#39;t look very intergalactic, so it&#39;s super useful for any sort of tech persona who uses equipment like this.</p>

<p>His bulky armour piece wasn&#39;t a new mould, but it was exclusive thanks to the classic space logo printed on his right shoulder-pad. I&#39;ve always liked this armour piece, and it definitely feels fitting for this figure.</p>

<p>Under his armour is a torso print that resembles orange safety straps. The colours on this figure all work surprisingly well together, and the torso is no exception. He doesn&#39;t have back printing, of course, but he does have some interestingly coloured arms, which are caste in light brown, or tan.</p>

<p>The leg continue the detailed printing, all the way down to the silver steel-toed boots.</p>

<p>His accessory is made up of two pieces, the first of which is a ray gun. Now we have got that piece as an accessory an uncountable amount of times, and I would normally rage at this figure for it, but the drill at the front saves it for me. You might be thinking it was a new piece for the figure, but in fact, you&#39;d be wrong. It&#39;s actually Unikitty&#39;s horn from The LEGO Movie! This is some mind-blowing part usage, and it looks like it was made for this setting, though it completely was not.</p>

<p>Overall, while I do think it&#39;s a little weird to choose a space miner before a normal miner, this is an awesome minifigure. The new helmet piece looks crisp and perfect, and the drill blows my mind. He scores a 5 out of 5 for me!</p>
