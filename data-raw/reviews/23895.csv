<p>The Swashbuckler has a double-sided torso print with an open frilled shirt showing off a bare chest and a fancy looking cumberbund/belt with a golden star buckle. The hat was used last with the Musketeer if memory serves and the facial print looks like a fancy grey mustache and matching eyebrows.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fairly weak offering as far as a fun character goes for the younger fans, some might have fun using the rapier and fighting against some foes to protect the world or something, however for most&nbsp;collectors the parts are more interesting for MOC minifigure fans. Mildly recommended.</p>

However, two figures seem to be on a lower level of quality and detail as others, those being the Lifeguard, who&#39;s my least favourite of the series, and unfortunately, the Swashbuckler, who includes 7 pieces. Like the rest of the series, he was released in 2014, where he was part of the first unlicensed series to cost $4 dollars.</p>

<p>Atop the character is an excellent hat piece that was first introduced with the Series 4 Musketeer in 2011, so it&#39;s great seeing it return here, and in a new colour, at that. This red-brown tone looks preferable for this piece over the original black tone, and I&#39;ve always been impressed by the detail in the curved-up side of the hat. A small hole for accessories is present at the back of the hat, and that allows for a red feather quill to peg in. While I think a darker red tone would&rsquo;ve looked better, this is a fantastic inclusion.</p>

<p>The head print here I suppose is nice. I always like seeing chipper smiles on minifigures, and he has a tan moustache to accent it. Something about this head makes me happy, and I&#39;m not sure what!</p>

<p>His torso has a nice print, however the yellow flesh doesn&#39;t perfectly match the colour of his head. I appreciate the red belt with that big ol&#39; golden belt buckle, and surprisingly, that printing carries onto the back, where the red belt is continued. I would have certainly complained if he lacked it, since the figure otherwise lacks detail.</p>

<p>Nothing at the legs, and he only includes one accessory, that being his golden fencing sword. It&#39;s caste in perl gold, but it feels like a weak accessory, since the original Musketeer from Series 4 had the same accessory in pearl silver.</p>

<p>Overall, this figure is a remake of the Series 4 Musketeer, and though I don&#39;t really love that CMF, this figure is a little bit worse. I like the recolour of that hat piece, but nothing else necessarily stands out for me. I&#39;m gonna give him a 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I hope this was informative and useful!</p>
