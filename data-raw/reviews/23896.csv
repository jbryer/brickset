<p>I didn&#39;t expect to care one way or another about this minifigure, but it has turned out to be by far my favorite out of Series 12, and it&#39;s all because of the detail.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>First of all the hair.&nbsp; Yes, it&#39;s the same big layered hairstyle the lead guitarist sported in the hard-to-find Rock Band set.&nbsp; And the Rocker Chick in layered pink from CM Series 7.&nbsp; But in this minifigure, you get a silver zigzag outlining two of the layers in front!&nbsp; Genius!</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the legs, with silver knee patches and a thin silver line of studs going up from a triangle at each knee&nbsp; and across the waistline, which somehow helps to elongate the legs and make the guy seem taller.</p>

<p>And the jacket!&nbsp; The jacket with lines of studs up the front, a studded belt, and a studded collar, and if you thought those tiny silver dots were about as tiny as careful painting could get, you can take a look at the tiny dots of the asymmetrical zipper, which are also silver.</p>

<p>Oh, and what about the silver studs AND zippers on each of the arms?&nbsp;&nbsp; I count 22 studs on each arm, not even counting the tiny zipper dots -- all of these things in silver, which add to the shiny reflections of all the layers in the hair to make this guy shine from every angle.&nbsp; Except the back, where he&#39;s all in black, as if you&#39;re seeing him outlined from the rear of a stage against the stadium spotlights.</p>

<p>So that has to be the ultimate in minifigure paint jobs, right?&nbsp; But wait!&nbsp; There are dots even smaller than the tiny smaller-than-silver-studs zipper dots -- the rock star has extremely tiny black dots of chest hair, which seem to configure the pectoral muscles of a totally flat minifig torso until you&#39;re not sure what you&#39;re actually seeing.</p>

<h3>The guitar</h3>

<p>Oh, and after all of the above, there&#39;s a guitar, which once again has some of the most amazing painting on it -- a sort of thin black spiral against the basic rock starburst shape of the guitar, and then on top of all that, extremely accurate and detailed silver printing on frets and knobs and a guitar neck so tiny and rounded that you can&#39;t even imagine how the paint machine managed to line up three infinitesimal silver guitar strings along it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;m tired just describing all the design work and paint execution that made this amazing figure.&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t put it in my minifigure case with the rest of Series 12 -- I had to take him to my office to put up on my computer monitor until I could get a spare.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I rest my case.&nbsp; Everyone who thought that minifigure painting reached its acme in Lord of the Rings needs to get one of these minifigs and just stand in awe.&nbsp; It&#39;s just amazing.</p>

<p>The level of detail on this figure is quite impressive. With&nbsp;a rhinestone jacket open to reveal the hairy chest of the performer, he includes side-arm printing for more details on the sleeves of the jacket. The legs include decent printing with knee pads, his face includes shades and a smirking grin, and the hair piece is the same found on the Rocker Girl from Series 7. His guitar accessory is also the same, done this time in red with some black printing for a fun looking hypno pattern.</p>

<p>Overall this minifigure looks great and is very welcome. I strongly recommend tracking him down if you missed out because he&#39;ll go great with the past rock stars and rock musicians we&#39;ve seen from past Series.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-04T15:01:33.793Z","ROCKING!","<p>LEGO Minifigures Series 12 is a fantastic series, and nobody will be able to change my mind. I love most every figure found within it, and the Rock Star is no exception. Now I will admit, the concept behind him is slightly weak, since we got the Punk Rocker in Series 4 and the Rocker Chick in Series 7. However, this takes an interesting enough approach to the trope, and it does make it feel original. He retailed for 4 dollars, back in the day.</p>

<p>On top is a fantastic hairpiece. It was originally introduced with that Series 7 Rocker, funny enough, however it is recast in black here. I think it looks superb, and the silver streaks are definitely welcome touches.</p>

<p>His face print is highly useable outside the setting, which always makes a CMF better for me. He sports nice shades, and that chipper smile is wholesome.</p>

<p>The torso is surprisingly impressive! Not only is there some miniscule chest hair printed under the jacket, but that black jumpsuit is full of intricate silver sequins and highlights, even down to the silver belt-strap. I will be honest and say that he would have greatly benefited from any sort of back printing, none of which is included. In my opinion, the side-arm printing makes up for it, since it really isn&#39;t that necessary. Several sequins are scattered throughout its length, all while looking splendid.</p>

<p>His legs have more silver accents and sequins, as well as those big silver boot details. Again, he could have benefited from side-lef printing, but perhaps I&#39;m being too picky.</p>

<p>His accessory is an electric guitar, and yes it&#39;s extremely fitting, but both the previous CMF rockers had electric guitars, so I think two accessories should have been included, such as a microphone or something. Nonetheless, his guitar does have good detail, including the individual silver guitar strings which end at silver tuners. A black swirl is implemented as well.</p>

<p>Overall, this has to be my favourite CMF rocker LEGO has ever made. It&#39;s super faithful tp the trope, and it does a great job at what it sets out to do. 5 out of 5!</p>
