<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Series 12 packet and sheet are attractive as they were the first several times.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Prospector has only one new piece, which is his hat. However, he reintroduces Wiley Fusebot&#39;s beard in grey, and his pickaxe is nice to have.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He looks very nice. I actually prefer this one to the 5-second wonder in&nbsp;<em>The LEGO Movie</em>. He&#39;s the typical kooky old prospector, and he looks great. His hat is huge, and it&#39;s got a nice sculpt, with the folded-up front and the tear in it. It is Reddish Brown, and it has a nice patch printed on it. The shape of the hat is similar to the Swashbuckler&#39;s, so be careful when you feel the bags. His face has a nice crazy grin, and he&#39;s missing several teeth. However, he must have found some gold at one time, since one of those teeth is printed in Metallic Gold. He has some stubble on the lower half of his face, and the beard looks good on him. His torso has been compared to the Grandpa&#39;s, and it is similar, but he lacks the bow tie. His hip joint is printed with the suspenders&#39; buttons, and the button for the pants. A Reddish Brown patch is printed on one of the legs. The pick is the same as Bofur&#39;s from The Hobbit, but it appears in many other sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like him quite a bit. The concept is executed well. They missed the opportunity to give him&nbsp;a gold nugget (the crystal piece in Pearl Gold, which is fairly common). It would have been a nice touch. Otherwise, if you like Western, or even if you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll probably like this Minifigure.</p>

GOLD!","<p><strong>Set #71007 Prospector: </strong>The Gold Rush is well documented in history, LEGO has a lot of potential for making tons of new characters for the wild west, and so we are introduced to this tired looking scruffy old prospector searching for gold out in the old west of LEGO City.</p>

<p>The prospector however is another of the weaker offerings from Series 12, he has a single-sided torso print, minimal leg printing showing the wear and tear on his pants, he includes a nice new hat piece with a wide brim and a fun looking gap toothed smile expression on his facial print. Reusing the Wiley Fusebot beard piece and giving him a large pickaxe accessory.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m not as impressed here as I am with other figures. It&#39;s a nice looking figure, and looks good with the rest of the Western based CMF figures, however unless you&#39;re going for a complete set he&#39;s safe to skip. It would have been nicer if LEGO had included a gold bar piece to go with him. Or perhaps a new gold nugget piece, the pickaxe is a rather weak accessory.</p>

<p>The hat piece was a brand-new mould for this character, which is always appreciated. The moulding on that massive rim is neat in how it curves upwards, and there is a small patch printed onto the front. I wish to see more of this hat piece in LEGO, but sadly, I&#39;m not positive we ever saw it outside this series, though I could be wrong about that.</p>

<p>His face print is darn expressive. I enjoy his cheeky smile, and he even has that small golden tooth. A scruffy beard is printed around his mouth.</p>

<p>His beard recolours the beard piece introduced in The LEGO Movie Series&#39; Wiley Fusebot. Getting it in grey is obviously very useful, though I&#39;ve never personally been the biggest fan of the mould.</p>

<p>I love the torso on this guy, albeit one-sided. The light peach colour matches well with the overall aesthetic of this character.</p>

<p>His legs have a small amount of printed detail, including some buttons on the waist, and a small, dark brown patch on his leg.</p>

<p>As far as accessories go, my guy only includes one, that being a fitting pick-axe. It was far from a new part or anything, but it certainly feels appropriate for the figure.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this design, and while I love Series 12, this is probably one of the weaker characters. I&#39;m still scoring it at 4 points because of the new hat mould.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
