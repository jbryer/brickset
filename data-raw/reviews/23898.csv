"darthdc","2014-10-15T21:55:10.983Z","A wizard for all King Arthur fans (and Castle fans)","<p>Ok, so plainly named Wizard, this figure could easily be called Merlin. He is one of 2 figures in Series 12 to feature a steep sloped brick instead of legs. He comes with a nicely decorated cape with star and moon pattern, matching his blue pointed hat&nbsp;(which may have been nicked from a cartoon mouse) and robes.</p>

<p>His staff is a recolour of the one found with the elusive Mr Gold of Series 10, and is made from a lightsabre&nbsp;blade, a telescope and purple gemstone. Its these parts that make the Wizard identifiable from the other figure with a slope brick.</p>

<p>His beard is a new piece, I believe, and hides the bottom half of an elderly looking face.</p>

<p>His hat, again a new piece, is nicely decorated with silver stars and gold crescent moons.</p>

<p>The pattern is repeated on his torso and bottom half, along with a rope belt that spans the two pieces.</p>

<p>His purple cape has the same pattern, and is divided into two parts. It can be tricky putting both parts on the neck pole, followed by the beard piece, then the head. The idea is for the pattern to be on the outside.</p>

<p>Pro&#39;s</p>

<p>Nice number of pieces. Silver and gold patterns on torso parts and cape really stand out.</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>I&#39;ve noticed that the top part of his cape is beginning to fray. The only real downside of what is a very nice figure.</p>

"8BrickMario","2014-10-16T17:37:12.597Z","The Magical Wizard","<p>One of the most detailed and complex Minifigures from the series. Was this one worth it? I&#39;m going to say YES, but read on for why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typical Series 12 packet and pamphlet. Once you&#39;ve seen one, you&#39;ve seen (and reviewed)&nbsp;them all.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Ten parts here (the CMF maximum, shared with the Bride and Hockey Player)! His most notable piece is the new conical wizard hat, which is crooked at the tip, and printed with the star-and-moon pattern all over his robes. He reuses Gandalf&#39;s beard, and his cape is the same style and color as the Alien Villainess&#39;s, with a separate inverted collar piece. The cape is much softer, comparable to Vitruvius and Galadriel&#39;s, since there are silver stars and moons printed all over one side of both pieces (they&#39;re cleverly hidden in all official images, but they are on the back.) He uses the 3-long bar new in Dark Brown for his staff, and a Dark Brown telescope and trans-blue diamond are used on the staff as well. He has a slope brick instead of legs, and due to this, the conical hat and slope can easily cause one to mistake him for the Princess. Look for the staff&#39;s bar or telescope or the crooked tip of the hat for this one!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Because this one has ten pieces, it&#39;s a bit longer than others, especially due to the two cloth pieces and the beard.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is perfect. The classic starry-robed Merlin imaged is captured amazingly well here. Finally, we get a wizard without the brimmed &quot;witch hat&quot; piece. His face depicts a bemused old man, with some nice wrinkle detail, and no glasses, for once. His torso and slope are&nbsp;detailed with silver moons and stars, and a rope belt. His staff is held at a good level in his hand, and looks quite proper. Situationally, he goes well with the Princess and Jester of this series in a castle court, and he could be a good counterpart to the Evil Dragon Wizard from the most recent castle sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like the Wizard. He&#39;s well detailed, captures the concept perfectly, and this is all for a CMF. I would definitely recommend picking this one up, if you are absolutely positive the packet you&#39;re holding isn&#39;t the Princess instead.</p>

"Sethro3","2015-07-28T15:57:33.487Z","I'm the Wiz. Nobody beats me!","<p>Very Merlin-esque figure. I don&#39;t know how many wizards one Medieval village needs, but I would recommend getting this one, if only for the new pieces and variety in color.</p>

<p>He definitely is a brighter addition than the dreary LOTR Gandalf (whom I also love, by the way). The blue and purple work together quite well here. The printed pieces are phenomenal, like always.</p>

<p>He utilizes the new cap style seen only in this series of CMF. The beard is a re-use from LOTR&#39;s Gandalf, but it is very suitable. And the staff is easily managed with this shaping, although I would have preferred a new molded piece (which is asking a lot considering all of the other details they put into this figure).</p>

<p>I feel the price increase has hurt my interest in these impulse buys. Only time will tell if it is truly a good value for the money spent, but I don&#39;t buy as many now that they&#39;ve increased the prices.</p>

<p>But all in all, I would recommend picking him up if you can find him at a good price. The pieces will add to many scenes or your collection.</p>

<p>Series 12 joined the CMF line in 2014 and #1 on the checklist is this impressive looking sorcerer who looks quite impressive, and perhaps hints at the possibility of a Yen Sid for Disney Series 2.</p>

<p>The Wizard is dressed all in blue, with a single-sided torso and a sloped brick printed with a bunch of stars and moons and of course the rope belt used to fasten his robes. He includes a familiar looking grey beard piece and two separate purple capes again with stars and moons printed on them to add details to the back. His staff is composed of three pieces, a brown lightsaber blade, brown telescope and blue jewel and his hat is an all new piece with stars and moons printed as well. He has a single-sided head with old man eyebrows and a clean shaven smiling expression.</p>

<p>Overall this is a very good minifigure, the design is excellent and the new wizard&#39;s hat piece is a welcome addition for Classic Castle fans. The cap is sculpted in such a way that it truly invokes the classic image of Yen Sid, as does everything else about his design. I am quite hopeful that Disney Series 2 might see a re-use of this hat piece for an official one, but for now he&#39;s a decent enough stand in. Recommended.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-20T14:07:20.56Z","MAGICAL!","<p>LEGO Minifigures Series 12 is one of my favourite series&#39; ever, and there are a ton of great characters incorporated in it, including the first figure, the Wizard. He includes&nbsp;10 pieces, and was released in 2014, where he surprisingly cost $3.99.</p>

<p>Atop the ancient sorcerer is a pointy hat that was a completely new mould for the figure. Not only does it have great, wrinkly detail at the back, but it has some extensive, shiny, silver star and moon icons, and that printing is applied 360 degrees around.</p>

<p>Wizard&#39;s head has a surprisingly useful expression, which depicts a clean-shaven, elderly, smiling man. We don&#39;t get a lot of old minifigure expressions, so I definitely appreciate this. It is not dual-sided, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Wizard uses Gandalf&#39;s beard from The Lord of the Rings lineup of sets, which released a few years prior. Obviously, considering its origin, this beard is highly fitting, and the dark grey colour looks well against his blue dress.</p>

<p>As you can see, the Wizard sports two cloth parts, which are made from a thick material that allows it to stick up behind his head. They&#39;re done in purple, but boy, the extensive star and moon printing is fantastic.</p>

<p>His torso is only printed on one side, but that&#39;s okay, since his cape would conceal it anyway. I still appreciate his star and moon icons, as well as the rope around his waist.</p>

<p>That rope is continued onto his bottom dress piece, which is simply a 2x2 sloped brick. There&#39;s more star and moon icons printed onto the front, as you can see.</p>

<p>Sometimes the accessory included with a CMF is ultimately lame. That is not the case here! I love his three-piece rod, which consists of a blue jewel, a dark brown lightsabre hilt, and a dark brown rod. It resembles one cohesive piece, and I love that accessory, as it reminds me of Tolkien&#39;s Gandalf.</p>

<p>Overall, Series 12 is one of my favourite series&#39; ever, and it is packed full of interesting and detailed figures. Wizard is definitely one of them! Not only does all his extensive detailing impress me, but it&#39;s an absolutely golden idea. He&#39;s an easy 5 out of 5 for me!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Thanks for reading!</p>
