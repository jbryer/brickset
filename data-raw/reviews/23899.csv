They are goofy to have, but it&#39;s even more goofy finding uses for them around your city. This one would look great as a Spy hiding out at a farm among other pigs, or even out front of a Butcher&#39;s shop asking people to come in and try some delicious samples.</p>

<p>The coloring and printing is well executed. The headpiece is great. I hope they do one like this only with a Lion&#39;s head (either for Hercules or more playful for Luna Lovegood).</p>

<p>My main qualm is a green apple. I have tons of green apples, but very few of the newer red apples and this could have been a good time to include one since they came out that same year.</p>

<p>Definitely pick this one up if you can find it. I bet he will go for a pretty penny in the aftermarket.</p>

Animal Suit characters are always the best and are highly collectible, and often they don&#39;t offer much more than the cute or goofy look to them.</p>

<p>This minifigure is all pink, one of the pinkest minifigs ever made, I can&#39;t even remember any minifigures that are made mostly with pink colours. For prints you have very minimal detail work on his double-sided torso, with the front showing off a piggy belly and the back a cute little curly tail. His legs have two small printed details on his feet for the hooved look and the newly sculpted head piece looks awesome. The head underneath the mask has a simple little smiling expression and he&#39;s carrying a green apple, which works well.</p>

<p>Overall, I strongly recommend this one, get multiples if you can and you can have the three little pigs and the big bad wolf using Series 14&#39;s werewolf. Series 12 is long gone from stores, so you&#39;ll have to get this one from the secondary market, but it is well worth tracking down if you missed out on it.</p>

However, a figure from this set that seems to be more popular than some others is the Piggy Guy. I find it odd that his name is Piggy Guy, rather than Pig Suit Guy or something along those lines. Nonetheless, he was released in 2014, and retailed for 4 dollars.</p>

<p>On top the figure is a piece that really makes the figure for me, that, of course, being the pig mask. It was a completely new mould made exclusively for this figure, and it looks fantastic. Not only are the ears accurate to the floppiness of a real hog, but the pig snout looks so adorable. Thanks to that mask, I can definitely see this figure being in a modern day CMF set.</p>

<p>Something else I love about this figure is his head piece, which uses a marvellous print. All it is a small, simple smile, but that&#39;s enough for me to want it. I love getting generic expressions in CMF&#39;s, since they&#39;re all the more useful outside their respective setting.</p>

<p>The torso here has just the right level of detail, where it doesn&#39;t look overbearing, while still being faithful to a real life pig. Two fat rolls are printed onto the front, while the back has an adorable little piggy tail. Some might be triggered by the lack of a physical tailpiece, but since the head mould was new for the figure, I can excuse the lack of another new piece.</p>

<p>The legs here have very sparse printing, but that&#39;s completely okay, since he doesn&#39;t need a lot of crazy detail. He still has some black on the toes, which I highly appreciate.</p>

<p>As far as his accessory goes, I don&#39;t understand why he includes an apple. Sure, it&#39;s a nice mould, but it seems entirely and completely irrelevant to the character. With that being said, I commend LEGO for including one at all.</p>

<p>Overall, the Piggy Guy is one of the standouts in the series for me. It&#39;s an animal costume that honestly holds up next to todays CMF&#39;s. The new head mould makes the character all the better for me, and this has to be another 5-star figure from Series 12.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for this review, thanks for reading!</p>
