"Novelty","2007-08-29T10:01:37.05Z","Swing-catapault","This small set consists of a catapault, some rocks for the catapault, a minifig with a crossbow.  The spear with flag is normally attached the the catapault but can be detached and held by the minifig as shown on the box.  The catapault can be swiveled to face any direction thanks to the turntable on which it is built.  The design is rather solid - load the missile, and flick the other end of the see-saw - the projectile actually flies quite a distance.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2009-04-22T22:18:17.937Z","Working catapult","Nice little catapult, solidly-built, can move in any direction and fire lego bricks.  There's also a couple of weapons, which are always useful, and a good selection of pieces.  My only complaint is with the minifig's face.  Is it me or does he look really camp?  He's meant to be a medieval soldier, and there he is looking like he's wearing eye-shadow!  What were the designers thinking of?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
