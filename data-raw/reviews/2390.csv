The hovercraft and the small truck are a great addition of my rock raiders vehicles.  The set is missing Chief unfortunately and Axle.  It does not matter much that it is missing Axle because he is in most rock raiders sets",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2009-01-17T18:56:07.827Z","Better than Power Miners","This is one of the best Rock Raiders sets ever made. The base has alot of cool features like a laser beam, a little garage for the scout flyer, the truck which is awesome, and the rock monster which is still cool to this day. This is a fantastic set to have in your collection and is sure to be a Lego Legend.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"starwarsgeek101_","2008-04-05T19:42:39.903Z","Absolutly A &quot;MUST BUY&quot;","A very creative set. The best from the Rock raiders. This set has amazing featres suchas the light and the crane. This is one of my Lego &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; sets. I have loved this set and nowadays it is extremely hard to find at a good price. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Brock_the_Builder","2008-12-12T09:55:25.327Z","Cool Colors, Some Neat Features","This is a pretty cool base set.  The 3D baseplate is awesome, and I like the color scheme for the Rock Raiders.  This is a modular build, which makes you anxious to see the finished product.  At the end, you place the towers and work stations onto the baseplate.  Overall, this is a neat set, but it could use more cool stuff.  The crane is probably the best feature, aside from the light-up piece.  I just think they could have put more &quot;secret&quot; type stuff into it.  There are hidden compartments under each work station, but they are not used.

All in all, this is a good set.  It is a must have if you have any Rock Raiders sets, since they need a base of operations.  If you can find this set in good condition, it is a great addition to your collection.

Pros: colors, cool minifigs, baseplate, only Rock Raiders base set

Cons: needs more features, not many pieces",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-21T07:11:51.45Z","(almost) straight from the game!","This set provides the ultimate items for building a scene straight from the game, since everything included (except for the center station, and the hovercraft) is in the PC or PS game! Wow, even if your not a fan this is still a great playset, though a little pricy today, it is still great! Incleds plenty of figures, accesories, a rock monster and 5 items straight from the best LEGO videogame made. Not only does this set include a baseplate, but it also has electronics to boot. The only bases to top this so far are the Ice Staition Odyssey and the Neptune Discovery Lab! One of my favorite sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ROCK_RAIDER_GUY","2010-03-12T15:36:45.763Z","WOW, BETTER THAN I EXPECTED","<p>Got this off of bricklink for $95, BOXED, which is really good after 10 years. This is definetly the ""prized gem"" of the Rock Raiders series. I'm acctually surprised that they haven't brought it back yet as some random collecters set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>The Box</em></h4>
<p>For an old set, the box is HUGE!! It has a flap that shows the monster, Docs, and some other pieces</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>The Build</em></h4>
<p>The Main Structure of the base is the base plate. Most people think ""base plate? No way!!</p>
<p>However, it gives the set the look and feel of the underground caverns of Planet U.</p>
<p><strong>The Buildings</strong></p>
<p>The buildings on the base plate that are visible are the Teleport Pad, the Upgrade Station, the Mining Lazer (IMA&nbsp;FIREIN MA LAZAH!! XD)&nbsp; the top of the Powerstation (from the game) or the spinny thing that cuts open the ore, and a combination of the Ore Refiery/ Support Station/Bridge.</p>
<p><em>The Teleport Pad</em></p>
<p>Epicly cool.</p>
<p><em>The Mining Lazah</em></p>
<p>Surprisingly, this thing is extremely bright. Don't try to shine it in your eyes!</p>
<p><em>The Upgrades Station</em></p>
<p>This crane is perfectly perportioned to pick ore up overtop the Powerstation top, and to drop it in the refinery/ powerstation top</p>
<p><em>Ore Refinery</em></p>
<p>When small transport is placed infront of it, the ore can fall perfectly into the back basket</p>
<p><em>Powerstation Top</em></p>
<p>Kinda like the Teleport Pad, it's presence is epicly cool.</p>
<p><strong>The Vehicles</strong></p>
<p>This Set contains the Small Transport truck, and what looks like a modified Hover Scout (see set # 4910 if you don't know what a Hover Scout is).</p>
<p><strong>THE ROCK&nbsp;MONSTER!!</strong></p>
<p>This epic little guy is the funnest bit of the set. RAWRR!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pro's N Con's</h4>
<ul>
<li>+ Fun Build</li>
<li>+Monster</li>
<li>+4/5 Rock raiders come in the set</li>
<li>+2 Energy Crystals and Ore</li>
<li>+The fact that the Ore refinery can drop ore into the Small transport truck</li>
<li>------------------------------------------------------------------------</li>
<li>-wouldn't have hurt to try to incorperate gears into some of the Buildings/design</li>
<li>-otherwise cons are N/A</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is an EPIC WIN!&nbsp;If you can find one for a good price... BUY IT!!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-26T04:22:51.467Z","LEGO Rock Raiders - The Rock Raiders HQ Review","This set is the largest set of the LEGO Rock Raider theme ever made. It comes with most of the characters except Axel. The monster is also very cool. The whole creature is just one big piece and it's a rare piece to find. This set includes a dump truck as well and you won't have to worry about stickers.<br><br>The whole base rests on a big baseplate and we get lot's of play features. We get a crane which sviwels full 360Â°, we get a place to cut the rocks with a laser, we get a big laser canon which does light up (I'm not sure if this set does come with batteries) and a platform where the little speeder does fit in. We also get a monorail which can drop the rocks onto the dump truck. Some of those buildings like the crane or the laser canon also appear in the LEGO Rock Raiders videogame. It's a great set to play with and it's very sturdy. The built of that base was not that hard for me to put together but I enjoy building this set.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Harmonious_Building","2012-07-31T15:41:58.477Z","Life underground. ","<p>The Rock Raiders were a highly original concept as far as an expansion of the LEGO universe went, so it only makes sense that they get a base of operations to, er, operate out of. Unlike many other ""base""-type sets that preceded it, however, one unique aspect of the Rock Raiders HQ is its focus away from the combatative nature as depicted in, say, other Space-themed bases of the time, opting instead for a more economic/scientific point of view, which certainly keeps things interesting.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But is that interesting enough to spend $80 on a 400 piece set, as suggested by BrickSet's data? I did have this set as a kid and don't exactly remember how much was paid for it, but it can't have been cheap. With such a high price per piece, one would certainly expect gimmicks and other bells and whistles to sweeten the deal, and this is what we will explore. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Minifigs are thin on the ground as far as the HQ is concerned, and you only get four of them to operate this gigantic operation. Thankfully, a Rock Raiders ""battle pack"" (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=4930-1"">4930</a>) did exist at the time, so finding additional Raiders to populate your base probably won't be too much of a concern, should you choose to get this. Given the price of this set, though, an additional Minifig might have been nice. Still, the Rock Raiders line was quite different in the sense that each of its Minifigs had a distinctive design, giving each character a lot of personality&nbsp;- appropriate, since I guess there was some sort of ""storyline"" that weaved its way through the theme. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A nice inclusion here is the highly sought-after Rock Monster, which is a no-brainer inclusion in the theme's largest set. He's not nearly as detailed as other contemporary ""Macrofigures"" being produced today, but he's a lot of fun and cool to have. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The set construction follows very much in line with prevailing LEGO design of the time - a gigantic baseplate, a lot of enormous, highly-specialised pieces, and a plenty of hastily cobbled-together designs that go for shock-and-awe rather than for detailed design. The completed set is enormous and looks satisfying, there's no doubt about that, but much of its design is quite rudimentary and not terribly impressive upon greater consideration. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The coolest part of this set is arguably the ""dumping"" mechanism that straddles the centre of the set. The little control seat slides up and down a guided system, and the container thing tips over when it reaches the end, presumably into the vehicle below (if your aim is very good). And indeed, some thought went into the crane tower and ""rock analyser"" component in the front of the set for added interactivity, but the very nature of the baseplate makes each component seem very isolated. Compared to the intimate intricacy of Dwarves' Mine (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7036-1"">7036</a>), the HQ just seems loud and not altogether pleasing to the eye. In absence of any more complicated design, the HQ instead goes for the lowest common denominator and includes a ""laser"" light thing as the icing on the cake. It's cool, for sure, but even this just sits there and flashes light at things. Little thought seems to have gone into the effect of this light on the aesthetic of the base as a whole. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sort of see the Rock Raiders as a bold experiment that ultimately didn't quite achieve what it set out to achieve. A part of it was probably due to the weakness in LEGO design philosophy at the time, I guess, because I do think that it's an interesting idea. If the Rock Raiders ever get a new spiritual successor (I do know that <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Power%20Miners"">Power Miners</a> attempted to reboot the idea, but I own a grand total of zero of those sets and therefore cannot comment), what I would love to see is perhaps a ""steampunk"" version of underground explorers in the vein of pulp stories from the early 20th century. A Rock Raiders concept with more detailed designs is something that I would definitely go for. &nbsp;</p>",TRUE,2,3,3,5,2
