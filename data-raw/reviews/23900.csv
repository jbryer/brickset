"Tosadeac","2015-01-28T17:40:24.343Z","Thong?","<p>Finally opened a package and discovered the Lifeguard figure. &nbsp;I was super excited until I assembled him. &nbsp;Red shorts are painted only on the front and side when he is standing straight. &nbsp;The backs of the legs are yellow and give the appearance that he is wearing a thong! &nbsp;Also when he flexes backwards you see the tops of the legs are yellow as well. &nbsp;I feel like there could have been a little better attention to details with this minifigure.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A red lifeguard buoy and red binoculars. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like the minifigure, just wish they had completed the paint job</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-30T17:38:06.737Z","Sand, Surf and Sun","<p><strong>Set #71007 Lifeguard: </strong>In Series 2 we got a female lifeguard using a new piece, ten series later we get this male companion to help patrol the beaches of LEGO City.</p>

<p>This male Lifeguard has a singles-sided bare chested torso print and a leg print of swimming trunks with the initials J.T in the right leg. His accessories are a red rescue device and a pair of red binoculars for observing the swimmers on the beach. (Or at the pool.) He has a pair of stylish shades and a brown hair piece parted on one side.</p>

<p>Overall opinion, not the strongest offering from Series 12, however this minifigure does have a lot of uses, from the bare chested torso print to the very specific accessories. I recommend this as a parts figure, and for completists. Younger fans might like him for a complete set, however as I noted he isn&#39;t the strongest offering this series has to its name.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-25T16:47:08.617Z","WORST of the SERIES!","<p>I personally really like Series 12, but there is one figure that I can&#39;t help but feel let down by, that being the Lifeguard. This series released in 2014 where it retailed for 4 US dollars.</p>

<p>On top of the figure is that side-swept hair-piece that does seem to fit this character. I&#39;ve always loved the moulding surrounding it, and it is nice getting it in a dark brown colour here, and it was new for the figure in that colour. Honestly, it&#39;s my favourite part of this figure!</p>

<p>His face has a useful smirking expression, and his shades really sell the character. He lacks an alternate expression.</p>

<p>Though I already stated I&#39;m not a huge fan of this figure, he has good parts and prints, and the torso certainly falls into the latter category. It was far from the first shirtless CMF, but I always enjoy getting variations of it. He doesn&#39;t have any back printing, which is a little more acceptable here than with some o there minifigures.</p>

<p>Problems arise with this figure when we get to his legs. See, they have some useful trunks printed on the front and sides, which are red with white strings. I appreciate how the red is plastered onto the sides as well, but there are obviously a few places that look off. The front has some yellow showing inside the legs, but it just looks plain bad at the back. I understand this was before dual-moulded legs, but it just doesn&#39;t look good coming from a 2014 figure.</p>

<p>He includes two accessories, the first of which are just red binoculars. They weren&#39;t a new piece, but they certainly aren&#39;t that common in that colour. He also packs a red buoy, which is the same colour as the buoy found with the Series 2 Lifeguard.</p>

<p>Overall, the hair, head, and torso with this figure are great, but the reason I don&#39;t like him is because of his exposed backside, and how darn similar he is to the Series 2 Lifeguard. This is already a bad choice with that in mind, but LEGO didn&#39;t even bother to change the colours on him. Series 12 is fantastic, but this is EASILY my least favourite of the set. He only scores 2 out of 5 from me.</p>
