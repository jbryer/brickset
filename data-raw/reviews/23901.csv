<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I have trouble coming up with new things to say every time I write one of these reviews. But if you already own one of these, you know what the packaging entails.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Jester has some very good parts. His hat is printed in quarters for the first time (all previous Jesters had just the left and right halves as one color, this one has both sides in two colors. The reason most people got this one was for the cards, though, which are nice. Besides the cards and his head, the rest of the parts are limited to a jester&#39;s motley, and really have no external use.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Even though the instructions are not on this series&#39; pamphlet, I still had no trouble at all building this guy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like him quite a bit. He has an original color scheme, the first one not to involve red as a major color, and some nice printing. His entire outfit is Flame Yellowish Orange/Bright Light Orange and Purple, and his belt&#39;s comedy-mask shaped buckle and the bells on his hat and collar are Metallic Gold. His hat is quartered, as mentioned above, and his face is grinning, as if waiting for the audience to get the joke. His collar is scalloped, and each &quot;petal&quot; is alternating between the orange and purple. The arms and legs on either side are alternating, so his left arm and leg are different colors. His shirt is printed in two halves, with a lattice pattern that alternates as well; the purple half has the orange lattice, and vice versa. He wears a red belt, and his legs are different colors. His hat, however, is too loose. While not falling off, and not as loose as the Fairytale Princess&#39;s hair, it rotates at the slightest touch, and has to be adjusted constantly. His 1x2 tile playing cards are great. He has the two most famous cards of the deck: the Ace of Spades and the Joker. The latter card works well for use by Batman&#39;s archnemesis.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this one a lot. His hat is an issue, but we just have to deal with it until the quality improves.&nbsp;But I would recommend this guy. He&#39;s a lot better than just the cards.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-30T18:26:59.627Z","Pick a Card","<p><strong>Set #71007 Jester: </strong>I&#39;m all for a decent selection of minifigures, and it&#39;s nice to see another Classic Castle inspired figure, unfortunately I must admit that Series 12 seems to be lacking in certain aspects because of the selection.</p>

<p>This Jester includes torso printing of a single-sided nature and that&#39;s about it, the rest of the details are based on the colours chosen. His legs for example are double-moulded with one orange leg and one purple one matching the look of the printed costume. His belt is printed red and there is nothing else on the legs, which is most unfortunate as the diamond mesh design on the torso might have looked equally well if it went down to the legs.</p>

<p>His accessories are the high selling point for this figure, 50 more cards and we&#39;ll have a full set of playing cards for LEGO Minifigures. This one features the Ace of Spades and a Joker Card. Overall this Jester is ok, nothing special, aside from the colours and his card accessories he&#39;s pretty generic and I recommend him mostly for Castle fans, the printed cards and completists.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-30T15:02:43.357Z","an OVERLOOKED gem!","<p>A few clowns have been incorporated into the CMF line, including the Circus Clown, Small Clown, and Sad Clown, but Series 12 introduces another: the Jester. He wasn&#39;t a completely new concept, having been around in a few different Castle sets, including Advent Calendars. Those designs used either red and blue or red and white, while the Series 12 Jester uses an interesting palette of yellow and violet. Series 12 released in 2014, where it retailed for $3.99.</p>

<p>On top of the Jester is that iconic hat piece, and while it does appear so, it isn&#39;t dual-moulded, but rather, printed. This was not the first time this mould appeared, but rather, the first time it was printed in all 4 quadrants. The printing honestly looks way ahead of its time. Golden bells are printed onto the tips as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His face is easily the most useable&nbsp;part of the figure, if you ask me. It&#39;s SUPER useful for custom sig-figs, or LEGO stop motions, if you&#39;re into that sort of thing. I love getting casual expressions in CMF&#39;s, so this certainly does not dissapoint. He lacks an alternate expression, however.</p>

<p>Again, his torso is detailed as heck! It&#39;s caste in dark yellow, but the checkered printing around the sides and collar makes the figure appear uniform. Something which does bother me is his severe lack of back printing. I do appreciate his different coloured arms, at least.</p>

<p>The legs have a nice red belt atop, but the legs could have benefited from some printing. They&#39;re different colours, much like the arms, which matches well.</p>

<p>I think the most desirable pieces from this character are his playing cards, and for good reason. Not only are they really detailed, but as you can guess, they&#39;re useful! An ace of spades and a joker are included, and they&#39;re both exclusive prints, if I&#39;m not a fool.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this Jester is overlooked by Castle and casual fans alike. The quad-colored hat is pretty timeless, as is his fantastic expression. The cards are good too, but honestly, this whole figure is one that I&#39;m really glad is part of the series. 5 out of 5 from me!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
