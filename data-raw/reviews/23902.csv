<p>I ran to my local Fred Meyers as soon as I could after hearing that Series 13 had been released early at their stores, but unfortunately I could only find Series 12, but hey, it&#39;s still LEGO.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>This was a fantastic fig and I&#39;m happy I got it. He comes with the default minifigure body, cape, shield, sword, and a 3-piece helmet. All 9 parts are very nice and can be used in a variety ways for MOCers like myself. I especially like the cape, as it is not the normal design but a narrower, almost rectangular, tattered shape.</p>

<p>The front of the cape that wraps around his neck unfortunately does not stay down very well, and tends to fly up over his face a little. EDIT: if this happens, you&#39;ve put the cape on upside down.</p>

<p>His dark tan legs are printed with some sort of brown cloth, which looked very nice until I flipped him around and found that there is no printing on the back of his legs. Now, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single minifigure out there with back leg printing but especially with this design (brown detail, tan legs) it looks quite unfortunately that he is not covering up his rear end. An unavoidable but awkward flaw.</p>

<p>Despite these two problems the figure overall is still very high quality, and as long as he is oriented/displayed correctly he will look fine on display or in a MOC.</p>

<p>This figure has some great detailing. Definitely worthwhile to add to MOCs or an army you are building.</p>

<p>The new cape style works well for this figure. The material is the newer softer style they are going with in certain settings. It does allow you to have them sit without it being all crumpled. The printing is fantastic. The armor really works for many different types of figures. The new shield design is always welcome and I love the wood printing on it. As far as the helmet/headpiece goes, I like it, but I don&#39;t love the horn holes. The horns can work on it as it stands, but it is harder to re-use in other settings.</p>

<p>Value for money will be the same gripe I have in all of the reviews for this series since the price went up. The figure is great and worthwhile to your collection, but look for a good price.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-30T03:08:52.673Z","The Hun Army Appears","<p><strong>Set #71007 Hun Warrior: </strong>Series 12 continues with another LEGO CMF staple, historic warriors of ancient civilizations. This little warrior is a powerful looking soldier for the Hun army.</p>

<p>He includes the standard broadsword we&#39;ve seen most often since first introduced with Lord of the Rings, a nice round shield with a simple printed design, printing on his legs and a single-sided torso. New parts found here are a softer more rounded style of cape to simulate furred protection from colder elements, an interesting helmet piece with holes to insert the two horns and of course the horns themselves, first introduced during the LEGO Vikings era if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>Overall this minifigure is a very welcome addition, the facial printing looks excellent and the look of the figure in general is all around quite impressive. The new head gear will certainly see a lot of use in MOCs and indeed I&#39;m certain it already has seeing as this has been out of print, as it were, for the past two years. If you can find one for a good price on the secondary market and missed out on this series I&#39;d recommend tracking him down.</p>

<p>Comes in the normal CMS bag and has the normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides the normal minifigure&nbsp;parts you get a dark grey sword, and a shield with printing on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Hun Warrior is a good figure to get. The new helmet piece with the horns and the unique molding to it is really nice. The fabric cape on him is really good as well. The detail printing on his body and legs is done really well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a great figure. In my opinion this is one of the better figures from this CMS wave. The helmet with all of the new molding is really nice, along with the dark grey sword and shield with the printing on it. The face and printing on the body is also nicely done. Overall I&#39;m giving a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-20T16:52:58.123Z","do I DIG IT?","<p>I&#39;m certainly not the biggest fan of historical CMF&#39;s, since they often repeat concepts and become stagnant. I don&#39;t hate all history figures though, and there is a&nbsp;few of that genre found in Series 12, including the Hun Warrior. So do I like the Hun Warrior? Let&#39;s find out! He was released in 2014, where he unpopularly retailer for 4 US dollars.</p>

<p>Atop the figure is a brand-new hat piece that was new for the figure. There&#39;s some intricate fur moulded around the bottom rim, and the band on top, as well as the tan border of fur is done in printing, rather than dual-moulding. I like&nbsp;how the sides of the hat extend below the head piece. Though it may appear otherwise, the white horns are separate pieces that plug into the sides via pole connectors. The horns weren&#39;t new parts, but they&#39;re always nice to get.</p>

<p>The head piece here has an angry scowl. I do acknowledge the print for being expressive, and I dig it, although it isn&#39;t all too useful outside the setting. It&#39;s a one-sided piece.</p>

<p>The most interesting piece on this figure (not the best, just the most interesting,) has to be his cape. At first glance it looks like a normal, jagged cape, right? Well the shape isn&#39;t what&#39;s interesting, it&#39;s the material it&#39;s caste in. Most capes in CMF&#39;s are of a hard material, but this figure uses a soft, flexible, felt cloth piece that was not normally seen in minifigures until about a year or two later. I much prefer flexible, soft capes over hard ones, so this material is much preferred.</p>

<p>The Hun Warrior&#39;s torso is underappreciated, as it has some superb detail. I also commend the brick red and dark brown colour scheme.</p>

<p>The hun&#39;s legs add another colour, that being nougat, which blends nicely with the other shades of red and brown. Something which really impresses me about this CMF is how crisp and clean the side leg printing is. It lines up seamlessly with the front detail, and I&#39;m impressed at how well that&#39; executed.</p>

<p>As far as his accessories go, the Hun Warrior has two, those being his sword and a shield. Neither are new moulds, but they&#39;re both fitting as heck. His sword doesn&#39;t have any exclusivity or anything, but his shield has exclusive printed detailing that fits with the rest of the figure.</p>

<p>Overall, in response to the review&#39;s title, yes, yes I do like this minifigure. Not only does he introduce a new hat and a new material altogether, but the printing is underrated, especially at the sides of his legs. I don&#39;t typically love historical characters, but this is an easy 5 star figure for me.</p>
