<p>Blah blah blah&nbsp;CMF packaging. Seriously, it gets boring after your first two Minifigures in the series. But it is quality packaging and the checklist pamphlet is good, too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This one has some great parts. The hairpiece (shared with the Dino Tracker in Dark Brown) is the highlight, and the smoky genie tail returns, as well as the magic lamp.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very simple, especially since she has no neck accessories or skirts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>She&#39;s great. Close in approach to&nbsp;<em>I Dream of Jeannie</em>, she looks unique and distinctly different from the&nbsp;<em>Aladdin</em>-themed Genie of Series 6. Her hair looks good in blonde, and it is the perfect hairstyle for the character. It&#39;s tied-back hair with a very long, straight, ponytail down her back. It has a Pearl Gold hairband printed at the base of the ponytail on the top of her hair.&nbsp;Her face has Dark Tan eyebrows, &nbsp;silver lipstick and silver sparkles on it, and she has a playful winking expression. Her torso is Light Aqua, and she uses dual-molded arms to give her short sleeves of the same color. Her top is cut short, revealing her midriff, and it has tassels hanging on the bottom. She has back printing depicting the same on the other side. Her belly button is visible, and a thin curve of Medium Azure is printed on the bottom of her torso to blend the tail with it. Her tail is the same color as the Genie&#39;s, but it now has silver sparkles printed on the front of it, making it appear more magical. The shape of the tail means that the Genie Girl can be placed on her lamp, and the tip of the tail can align with the spout to make her appear to be coming out of it. Some complain about the clutch of her tail, but that&#39;s the way it was created, with less depth in the hole of the tail. I haven&#39;t had&nbsp;problems with it, though.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Phew! I wrote way too much!&nbsp;I like this Minifigure a lot! I would strongly recommend giving her a chance, because she&#39;s got a lot of personality and is pretty versatile, since any lucky minifigure&nbsp;could find her lamp!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-02T18:02:11.82Z","I dream of you","<p><strong>Set #71007 Genie Girl: </strong>I&#39;m sure ever since Series 6 and the original Genie we&#39;ve all wanted to see a female counterpart, and 6 series later we actually get one. She&#39;s great and here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>With a nice double-sided torso print of a cute halter top style harem outfit and a fancy looking star printed genie bottom torso piece this Genie Girl looks pretty impressive. Her facial expression is nice as well, with silver sparkling star details on her cheek and a winking smile with silver lipstick. Her hair piece is the same as the Dino Tracker done in blonde, and she&#39;s got the lamp accessory of course. My one and only complaint is that she doesn&#39;t include a double-sided facial print. It would have been nice if she wasn&#39;t always winking.</p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend hunting her down for your collection if you missed her the first time out. She&#39;s got a very nice look and her double-molded arms are the only ones in that particular shade of light blue/teal. I hope we see this long ponytail hair piece again, especially in red.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-05T21:30:04.453Z","She's OKAY","<p>In my quest to review Series 12, almost every figure has fallen&nbsp;into one of two categories: bad, and good. There&#39;s only been two bad figures, and all the rest have been fantastic, in my opinion. However, the Genie Girl is interesting in the fact that she isn&#39;t very interesting... meaning, she&#39;s nether bad, nor insanely great. She retailed&nbsp;for 4 dollars&nbsp;when she released in 2014.</p>

<p>On top is a hair piece that was introduced with this series. It was included in dark brown with the Dino Tracker, but here, it&#39;s caste in light blonde, which definitely does match the rest of the figure. I prefer this long, single pony-tail design over the standard one LEGO still uses to this day, even though it looks hecka outdated. This hair piece has some intricate strands of hair, as well as a nice, tight bun at the top. I love this hair mould, and I want to see it used more often in LEGO.</p>

<p>Her face print, while it is admittedly pretty adorable, could have been a lot more useful if it didn&#39;t have silver sparkles and blue lipstick. I can excuse it however, because I will admit, it adds to the figures overall aesthetic. I like her wink, since we don&#39;t see a crazy lot of winking expressions in the CMF line.</p>

<p>This figures torso, while a little suggestive coming from a CMF, has some great printing, and I&#39;m extremely pleased to know it carries onto her back. She uses dual-moulded arms, which are excellent additions, especially with that colour combo of light blue and yellow.</p>

<p>Her leg attachment was originally introduced in Series 6&#39;s Genie, however this has exclusive silver sparkles printed around the front. Nothing is integrated on the back of that piece, but I can excuse it.</p>

<p>Her accessory, which is a golden lamp, was also introduced in the Series 6 Genie, and I will admit, it&#39;s a very fitting inclusion.</p>

<p>Overall, I question the choice of this character. It&#39;s a gender swap of the Series 6 Genie, but it&#39;s quite different in aesthetic and design, so no problems there. I adore the hairpiece, as well as the back torso printing, but something about the figure doesn&#39;t exactly stand out to me. She scores a 3 out of 5.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. I hope it was helpful, thanks for reading!</p>
