"8BrickMario","2014-09-28T02:14:58.98Z","Battling for the top spot","<p>One of the best anticipated&nbsp;Minifigures upon original reveal. Is she really worth it?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>She comes in the standard Minifigure packet for Series 12. The pamphlet disappointingly lacks the attractive minifigure instructions that highlight the parts, instead, the back is used for an ad for the MMO.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Goddess has some excellent parts. Her helmet/hair piece is cast Cool Yellow with metallic gold paint, and is very well detailed. The helmet uses the Roman Commander&#39;s plume in white. She has a new color combination for her spear, and a shield (used on Captain America and the Warrior Woman)&nbsp;with a lovely Pegasus pattern.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty standard, and this was the fastest I figured out how to put on a minifigure skirt, since it&#39;s so distinctive.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;is very well designed. Her exposed hair is similar to Wonder Woman&#39;s, and her face has golden lipstick, while she has a disapproving expression. Her dress is slightly armored, and she carries that sword and shield. The classic Greek key design appears on her neckline and on the shield&#39;s border. Her appearance is a nice interpretation.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Playability&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>She goes well with some other Minifigures. Medusa and the Ocean King can be put with her to represent when Athena curses Medusa, and she could be used in a temple or throne room in ancient Greece.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this one. A lot. She&#39;s terrifically detailed, and she has the regal quality of a Greek god. If you can find her (look for the spear), I would strongly recommend picking her up.&nbsp;</p>

"Dirac","2014-12-04T23:27:43.327Z","A bit fragile for a battle, but good for display!","<p>This minifigurine was the one I was looking forward&nbsp;to get since I saw the promo and I managed to catch her via some shameful bag feeling - that spear of her is quite revealing and makes for an easy recognition!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The standout elements here are definitely the shield decorated with nice pegasus and some Greek pattern and the helmet/hair piece, which is molded with great detail. Also her torso is worth noting for having printed back (which is mostly covered by the long hair from helmet piece) and even some golden bracelets printed on the arms, which are not visible on the photos. Her legs come with a golden hip which seems to be quite rare as well. The skirt has an unusual pattern.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Well, the Battle Goddess looks really great. The choose of colours&nbsp;with white, golden, yellow and some brown makes a terrifying combination and all of those small details like golden lipstick, golden sandals and bracelets mentioned before. Her facial expression is something between hostility and disapproval.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>She is more complex than the usual minifig due to that skirt - it is easy to assemble, but I needed to press it between some heavy books to form it correctly and it still isn&#39;t perfectly tight-fit.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite looking great, the minifig seems to be rather fragile - her helmet/hair piece is quite lousy, it doesn&#39;t fall by itself, but doesn&#39;t need too much strength&nbsp;to be taken off either. Also the skirt, which took me quite a while to position correctly, is easily stirred. Another con would be a little clumsy finish on the blade of her spear - the golden paint there is completely fine, but the plastic is a bit too flexible.</p>

<p>But besides these little problems, the figure remains my favourite from this series so far - it&#39;s definitely worth having her on display!</p>

"Hylocera","2015-04-16T07:17:56.997Z","This Is (might be) Sparta!","<p>I got this minifig along with a few others after I finally found a box of Collectable Minifigures at the local store. For $2.99, I&#39;d say this fig was absolutely worth it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with all collectable minifigures, the goddess has some very nice equipment. The shield has an ornate border with a gold pegasus printed in the center, a somewhat annoying cloth skirt piece (I&#39;ll get to that in a second), a classical era helmet with hair attached, and a gold-tipped spear.&nbsp;The fig&#39;s&nbsp;torso printing is on point and the face is printed with some gold lipstick, a nice addition to the still small&nbsp;number of female minifigure heads. Quality stuff overall. Oh, and her legs are printed with some sort of gold underwear that isn&#39;t visible in the main picture.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly simple, and like the nice parts this is common with Collectable Minifigures. The skirt, however, is a fiddly piece that has 3 holes for attaching to the leg piece. It is pretty difficult to understand what I am saying without messing with the fig in person. But long story short, it is VERY annoying figuring out how to get the skirt on correctly and even now, after having this fig for I think 5 months, I still am not sure I have it on right. I doubt there is an obvious solution that I am missing since I have probably fiddled with it for close to an hour in total, so as neat as it looks it is a pain to get on.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Even with the skirt piece slightly off the minifigure overall looks fabulous. The shield can easily be repositioned to hide badly/unattractively attached skirts. This &quot;battle goddess&quot; looks great on display alongside Elrond, Galadriel, and the Hun Warrior, fitting right in with these other medieval-ish minifigures.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is definitely one of those minifigures that given the financial resources I would like to build an army of. I recommend this set to anyone who likes the classical era; this minifig is perfect for MOC&#39;s of that time period, and since her name is &quot;battle goddess&quot; she would make a great Athena.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-30T17:11:03.09Z","Legends of the Amazons","<p><strong>Set #71007 Battle Goddess:</strong> From Series 12 we find another excellent looking figure from history and mythology. The Battle Goddess represents the Amazons and the Greek Gods all rolled into one.</p>

<p>She includes an elegant looking double-sided torso print with a white and golden armour her legs have very minimal printing some sandals on her feet and a golden bikini like bottom aromour. This is due to the new skirt piece she uses which effectively covers up the legs. Her head piece is brand new as well with a blonde hair do under a Roman/Grecian styled helmet, a plume is included to attach to the top.</p>

<p>Her accessories include a nicely printed circular shield piece with the image of a pegasus on the front and the spear weapon we&#39;ve seen for a long time in the CMF line. Overall this female warrior is an excellent looking minifigure and definitely worth tracking down if you missed her when she was initially released. Her parts make a great selection for customisers as well. I&#39;d enjoy seeing her helmet return with darker hair tones, we may see this eventually. Recommended.</p>

"SanMams91","2015-02-28T04:02:27.35Z","My favourite LEGO minifigure ever made","<p>As the title states, this is absolutely, my personal favourite minifigure that LEGO has designed. She is spectacular, has printed bracers&nbsp;on her &#39;wrists&#39;, beautiful torso printing, front and back, an interesting skirt pattern, fantastic facial expression, hairpiece mold, and the most beautifully detailed shield. She is a must have, and she is worth it! Bravo LEGO!!!</p>

"FREED0M","2015-07-11T15:42:44.687Z","A minifgure straight down from the heavens","

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just a regular collectible minifig foil pack, with a sheet of paper that lists all of series 12 minifigs. However, this particular minifig needs a proper image on the correct position of the white skirt piece. I thought it was just me when I had difficulties figuring out the right orientation and position of the skirt piece.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Almost all parts have golden prints (except the base of course!), and getting this minifigure is a nice way to get some shiny parts. Unfortunately the upper white piece on the helmet does not have any print, which would be nice if the lower part of the white piece has gold prints to match the helmet. The gold print on the shield also looks very detailed and really matches the minifigure. However the spear is just one piece and the gold tip doesn&#39;t really match the color scheme.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>At a glance, this minifig looks awesome with that kinda angry face. But funny to me, when looked from above, and the eyebrows of the minifig is not visible because ot the helmet, (only the eyelashes are visible) the apparent emotion of the minifigure changes, and seems as she was going to cry! And that happens because the eyelashes are slanted down, unlike the eyebrows.</p>

<p>And this minifig has lots of gold print, from the lips, torso, arms, hips and a little bit at the foot alongside the &quot;sandal straps&quot;, barely visible but makes this minifigure look more detailed.</p>

<p>Speaking of detail, even this minifgure has a golden &quot;underwear&quot; printed on it, how nice :D</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Everything is simple, except the white skirt piece. I am not familiar to this kind of piece, so it took me a while to figure out the correct orientation of this thing. But fortunately the skirt has different numbers of ridges on the sides (3 and 4) and the image on the paper helps a bit.&nbsp; Still, it would be better if there&#39;s an image on the paper that shows the correct way to put the skirt.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The minifigure looks great, really feels like an ancient Greece goddess is brought to the world of Lego and the golden dashes on most part somehow gives more &quot;royal&quot; look than &quot;divine&quot;, which is a bit off, I think.</p>

<p>But the downside is, again, the skirt piece. The skirt piece really limits the movement of the left leg, because when the left leg is moved forward, the front left corner of that leg will crease the edge of the skirt, and kinda stretch it. And fortunately enough the right leg still move around quite well.This skirt adds more display value, but really decreases the playability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When we put all together, despite all the downsides, this is still a great minifigure, with a lot of details; excellent for display but not recommended for play.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-23T15:42:11.09Z","most DETAILED in the THEME!","<p>I&#39;ve said it before and I&#39;ll say it again: Series 12 rocks. It&#39;s chot-FULL of interesting and detailed characters, and most figures in this series are some of my favourite CMF&#39;s ever. One of the concepts behind the fifth figure in the series is a little risky for LEGO&#39;s standards. The fifth figure of the set depicts, of course, a battling goddess. The Battle Goddess was released in 2014 where she retailed for 4 bucks.</p>

<p>Atop the figure is a beautiful hair/hat combo! The long, flowing, blonde strands of golden hair tumble over her shoulders elegantly, and the roman-style pearl gold helmet moulded on top has very refined and state-of-the-art printing. The white brush on top is a separate piece that pegs in using a LEGO Friends accessory connection.</p>

<p>Her head print is really hard-core, but I dig her determined expression. I love generic LEGO faces, as they&#39;re highly useful outside their respective settings. She doesn&#39;t have an alternate expression, but that&#39;s okay.</p>

<p>Her torso has some shiny, gold accents that contrast well against the white. This character even goes the extra mile to have some extremely detailed back torso printing, which is insane, considering she&#39;s already so detailed, and back printing wasn&#39;t too common in CMF&#39;s. Adding to her detail are side arm prints, which depict gold wristbands.</p>

<p>She has a jagged skirt piece, and I always prefer when skirts are individual pieces rather than prints, because it makes the figure feel less cheep. This figure is the opposite of felling cheap! Anyway, the jagged skirt is flat on one side, and it&#39;s made from a generally thick material, like most cloth pieces back in the day.</p>

<p>Her legs have very small, but very detailed printing. At the top is a gold bikini that carries on from the torso, and on her toes are some tiny sandals. Those shoes were completely unnecessary, so I am ecstatic they&#39;re incorporated here.</p>

<p>As if the minifigure isn&#39;t incredible already, she includes two amazing and fitting accessories, the first of which is a shield. It wasn&#39;t a new mould or anything, but that&#39;s my favourite LEGO shield piece because of how smooth it is on the front. It has some extremely detailed printing with that golden horse, and there are some nice markings surrounding the rim. She also incorporates a spear, which is dual-moulded. The handle is caste in hard, brown plastic, while the tip is caste in soft, gold-coloured rubber, to avoid any dangerously sharp points. I&#39;ve always loved this weapon piece!</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m gonna go out on a limb and say this is the most detailed CMF ever thus far in the line. It isn&#39;t my all-time favourite, but it easily cracks the top 5, possibly even top 3. Not only does it have some surprisingly well-executed prints, such as the front&nbsp;and back of the torso and around the feet, but&nbsp;she has that insane new hair-hat combo. She comes in at 2 points for me because of... just kidding, she&#39;s obviously a 5.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review, thanks for reading!</p>
