<p>The Dino Tracker is a female character that would fit in perfectly with the Dino Theme from LEGO. Her printing is very reminiscent of the minifigures found in that theme, with some great looking printing on her double-sided torso. She has a belt loaded with tranquilizer ammo, some scratches from a nasty encounter with a dinosaur and matching tears on her back. Her legs have belt printing and side-printing for the pockets she has.</p>

<p>Her accessories are a tranquilizer dart in a matching lime green to the needles found in the LEGO Dino Theme, she also has Hawkeye&#39;s bow. Her hair piece is brand new with a dark brown colour and a long ponytail. We haven&#39;t seen it reused yet, but I am certainly hopeful. Her torso also has double molded arms for a short sleeve look.</p>

<p>Overall this figure is a winner. You should definitely track the Tracker down if you somehow missed her back when Series 12 was first released. Strongly recommended.</p>

On top of all that, she&#39;s got ammunition on her chest and a ripped shirt. The cross bow and shot are also really cool!</p>

<p>This is a highly detailed display figure that is also good for play. I recommend it!</p>

Series 12 did its best to alleviate fans craving for dinosaurs when it released the Dino Tracker. This series released in 2014, where it retailed for $3.99.</p>

<p>The hair-piece atop this character was a new mould for the series, and it was exclusive to thin character in that colour, since it came with the Lady Genie of the same series in blonde. I feel like that piece is severely underutilised, but I think it looks fantastic! The curved moulding around the top looks appealing, and I like how far it hangs below her head at the back. The moulded lining all the way down its length is great as well. I honestly prefer this mould over the long pony-tail piece LEGO tends to use.</p>

<p>Her head piece has an excellent snarling expression that I can imagine people using for custom characters. The scuff on her face does add. She lacks a back facial expression, but I sort of expect that.</p>

<p>The torso has some very intricate detail. I like the vials around her chest, and the claw marks are very thoughtful. Believe it or not, the vial strap is carried onto the back, which I was not at all expecting. I feel like this is one of those characters that shines in detail, because she has the new hair, back printing, side leg printing, and even dual-moulded arms, which use dark brown and yellow. This was only the second minifigure series to use dual-moulded arms, so whenever I see them I definitely appreciate it.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, her legs have a shocking use of side-leg detailing, which was entirely unnecessary, and that makes me love it more. Those pockets are printed on both sides, but the front has a nice belt as well.</p>

<p>Accessory-wise she includes two, and again, that&#39;s so unnecessary, but even more appreciated. This figure feels like a direct add-on to the Dino 2010 line, because her vial is caste in the same lime green colour as most found in that 2010 theme. It&#39;s a nice inclusion, but she also comes with a bow and arrow. That accessory was originally made for Hawkeye in the 2012 Avengers theme, and its incredibly fitting to see it here.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an absolutely incredible figure! It has so many impressive parts, and it works so well, even in the playability department. 5 out of 5!</p>
