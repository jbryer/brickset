"darthdc","2014-10-15T22:18:31.9Z","One of Fairytales most famous odd couples","<p>The Princess and the Frog, to give this minifigure the right name?. This figure is a nice overall, but let down by the fact that the pieces are loose fitting.</p>

<p>The princess herself is comprised of torso, head, hat, and sloped brick rather than legs. She is one of two figures in the set to have a sloped brick, and for anyone wishing to know whether they have the Princess or the Wizard, then shake the packet. The Wizard has more pieces and you&#39;ll hear them rattle.</p>

<p>The Princess only comes with one accessory: a toad/frog piece. It has no painted details, and comes in plain bright green.</p>

<p>The Princess herself has the distinction of being the only figure in Series 12, with two faces. The one is a cheerful face with toothy smile, and the other is a &quot;ready to kiss&quot; face with closed eyes and puckered lips.</p>

<p>Her hat is a 3 colour&nbsp;piece comprising of auburn hair in a braided ponytail, with light purple&nbsp;cone shaped hat with white cloth flowing from the top.</p>

<p>Her torso is the same shade of light purple, with lilac coloured&nbsp;arms. The printed&nbsp;design of her costume is an outer robe around a purple patterned dress. The ribbon that holds the robe together spans the torso and sloped brick, along with the intricate pattern of her dress.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Its a nicely detailed figure, and in rare colours too. The frog fits on top of her hand and her arm can be positioned so that it does kiss her on the lips!</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>The hat/head and the torso/sloped brick connections are loose, and come apart too easily.</p>

"8BrickMario","2014-10-21T22:38:45.977Z","Buyer beware, she has loose hair!","<p>When I got this one randomly, I was pleasantly surprised by her quality. However, one major issue makes the Minifigure worth less.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The usual CMF bag and sheet for this series. This time, though, (like Series 10 and the LEGO movie), the instructions for how to build a minifigure are replaced by an ad, this time for Minifigures Online.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The lilac parts make this one very appealing. Her hat/hair is very detailed, with two colors of paint over the Dark Orange hair. The frog is common enough, but a necessary detail to give her the charm she has. She includes a slope instead of legs, and this combined with her hat shape can make her easy to confuse with the Wizard when feeling the bags. Look for the braid down the back of the headgear if you want this one.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>What&#39;s to say? Even without the instructions, it is very easy to put together a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>She looks amazing. The lilac color is beautiful, and the lavender arms complement it well. There is some extremely intricate lavender printing on her dress, with heart shapes formed by it, and the sash looks good too, with not too much of a printing gap at the edges of the slope and torso. The hair is nice, since it isn&#39;t the expected blonde, and the braid down the back looks very nice. The braid is pretty distant from her back, perhaps allowing accessories like a cape or quiver to be worn more easily. The hat has a piece of white cloth on it as well.&nbsp;Her face is excellent, with a cute expression of happiness or expectation, but she has a double-sided head! To tie to the frog accessory, she has a kissing face with her eyes closed. The only problem, and it&#39;s a big one, is that her hair has almost no clutch to her head. The head has poor clutch as well as the hair, but the hair doesn&#39;t work well on other minifigures. This seems to be an alarming problem with Series 12, where some heads and certain headgear have remarkably poor clutch to each other. So her hair pulls of with minimum force, and is prone to shifting off-center as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This would be a perfect execution of a great concept, but the poor quality issues with the pieces of this series made me dock more points than ever for this one. I&#39;m not at all sorry to have her, but if you do get her, just treat her gently if you don&#39;t want to replace her headgear frequently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This minifigure overall has a decent look to her, the rich purple coloring and the detailed print work for her dress are quite impressive. Though the torso is only single sided it still captures the look of a princess quite well. Even her tooth filled expression shows how happy she is to have potentially found her frog prince. And as a bonus it&#39;s a double-sided face, the other expression has her puckering up to kiss the frog with eyes closed. The new hat piece however is fairly disappointing mostly due to the loose nature it suffers from. I&#39;m not sure why, perhaps it started here, but lately I&#39;ve noticed that CMF figures head gear seems to not want to fit as snuggly as it could.</p>

<p>The hat and hair combined piece is a nicely sculpted addition to LEGOs large stable of interesting head gear, unfortunately it doesn&#39;t have the clutch power necessary to stand up to truly rough play. Just shaking her around quite vigorously while holding the hat will see her flying out from under it. A huge disappointment. I still highly recommend this minifigure, it makes an excellent display piece and there are quite a few uses to be had with her smooching expression, it&#39;s just a shame that the new hat piece is such a loose fitting one. Should the piece be re-used I certainly hope they solve its clutch power issue.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-21T03:01:09.013Z","Toad-ally good!","<p>LEGO Minifigures is my favourite LEGO theme ever, but there are a few series&#39; I like more than others, those being Series 16, Series 18, and Series 23, just to name a few. But a set of 16 I think is criminally underrated is Series 12, as it has a wide-variety of fantastic characters. I can really only think of 2 in the series&nbsp;I&#39;m not very fond of. Either way, the Fairytale Princess falls in an interesting place of the series, where I definitely don&#39;t dislike her by any means, but out of all the figures I like, she may be my least favourite. She was released way back in two-thousand and fourteen where she was part of the first unlicensed series to cost $3.99.</p>

<p>I spent way too much time rambling, but can we talk about how fantastic her hair/hat combo looks? It was new for the figure, and it has some excellent moulded detail, specifically on the white band and long, orange pony-tail at the back. Despite how good it looks, every review on Brickset complains about the piece having a weak connection to the head and popping off very easily. Nonetheless, the part looks appealing.</p>

<p>Honestly, my favourite part of the figure has to be her head print, which is as useful as heck. You see, her chipper smile is adorable, and it looks so genuine! Shockingly enough, this princess has an alternative expression, which depicts her delivering a smooch! That is darned useful, and I&#39;m SO glad to see it implemented here!</p>

<p>Her torso has some intricate detail, but I really commend the figure&#39;s light purple arms, which contrast against the slightly darker shade on her body and legs. She lacks back printing, though, and this figure could have benefited from some.</p>

<p>Her dress piece is, like the Wizard also found in this series, made from a simple 2x2 slope. It certainly works, and the printing at the front is darn intricate!</p>

<p>Her accessory is only a frog. While it wasn&#39;t new for the figure by ANY means, it&#39;s an unbelievably fitting part. I think it could have benefited from some sort of exclusive printing, perhaps on its back, but nonetheless, it&#39;s toad-ally sick. I&#39;m sorry, I had to.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for the figure, and since I am a fool and gave my final thoughts of the figure at the beginning of the review, my opinions are already spilled. I&#39;m gonna give her a very strong 4&nbsp;out of 5, because while she is far from my favourite, she&#39;s a fantastic concept that&#39;s executed nicely!</p>
