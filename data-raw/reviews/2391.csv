"LetsLego","2016-01-14T11:11:02.483Z","My main childhood set","<p>I got this set at around the age of 8 from my father. It was my only LEGO for sometime until me and my brother got 2 others sets from my uncle. I used it to create all sort of things. In general in those days the builds were structured mostly based on 2x bricks unlike today where more precise builds demand 1x. But nevertheless, the set is rich in parts for most ideas. I usually used it to create airport and airplanes, then at the end I used it to create a big house that was kept on the living room TV for years. I miss those early 80s days and looking at this set&#39;s picture brings a lot of memories.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Great box, simple instructions for few alternative builds</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>very good mix of parts for making buildings and vehicles. Big in size mostly, they make great set weight despite its just 400 pieces. That&#39;s great value for money at its time, it costed my dad $27.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I liked those &nbsp;minifigures, they are highly customizable and bigger than the ones LEGO decided to keep forever. The hands could be disassembled at joints and the figures have no lower half of body, you create that from regular parts.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a generic set with a&nbsp;lot of possibilities for a 5-10&nbsp;child.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Usually cool with enough detail</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set at its time, equivalent to Classic boxes nowadays.</p>
