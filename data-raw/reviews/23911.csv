<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is huge and heavy. Instructions are clear as they all are nowadays.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is very complete for those buying their first train set. It has many great details and parts you will not easily find. From the longhorn cow to the two spools and the forklift with it&#39;s female driver, good stuff.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It includes 9 minifigs which is a lot I think. But hey, I&#39;m not complaining! The new type of hats the farmer and one of the train people&nbsp;wear are cool, as is the long hair wig for one of the ladies. Good to see they keep coming up with new, fresh details like that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I enjoyed building it, I can imagine it might be difficult at some points for little children. Especially the locomotive, though it&#39;s awesome, is a bit tricky when it comes to the wiring of the battery/receiver. Same goes for the many, many stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The train station is cool to build as well. I enjoy that it is modern and again, has many details (you can tell I&#39;m into those, can&#39;t you?). The atm for buying tickets, the very complete bakery and the cool little LEGO shop. Really cool!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s pretty big! I have not been able to lay out a track yet (will do soon) but the length of the train and even the train station&nbsp;are both impressive. What is especially great in this superpack is that you have a complete train, but then you get an extra set of switches, extra track and a station! The only thing one might think is why would a freight train come with a train station for people... but let&#39;s not spoil the fun here!</p>

<p>The only thing I find missing is a simple level-crossing. Also because these are not sold seperately.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I can definitely recommend this set, especially if you can find it for the right price like I did (165 euro). It is very complete for anyone that buys his first LEGO train.&nbsp;It&#39;s also a set that offers a lot of fun in terms of playing. The many minifigs, the cargo station with a truck and the station with the little shops and taxi, it has a lot of possibilities. Finally, I think this is more complete, more fun and much better looking then&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">passenger train 60051, should you ever have to choose.</span></p>
