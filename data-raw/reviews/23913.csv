<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It comes in a polybag&nbsp;packing with a nice illustration on the front and the Ferrari sticker on the back to certify that it is a licensed product. The instruction sheet is typical of most polybag sets, but it comes with images of the remaining sets in the collection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Approximately 48 parts, and out of those 2 are little 1x1 round tiles in a flat green&nbsp;color.&nbsp;I have no idea what they are for, but one of them is shown in the instruction sheet right beside the completed model. My guess is, it is to replace the blue 1x1 round tile for another Ferrari driver (based on their individual helmet colors).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The pullback motor is integrated into a single base piece for the vehicle and I must say, it&#39;s a great little thing. Not very noisy like most pullback motors so that&#39;s a plus. In most pictures the wheels seem to have a shiny bit to the rims, but this is not so. It&#39;s actually a flat gold color, at least to me. It does stand out however in contrast to the black wheels.<br />
<br />
Only 1 of the pieces, the one that makes up the entire nose wing thing has printing on the front.<br />
<br />
At the end of the build you&#39;ll end up with 8 extra pieces (2 are the green round tiles I mentioned). Here&#39;s an image of the extras:<br />

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are no included minifigures in this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The build is straightforward like most polybags&nbsp;but the instruction sheet does not include a parts list, which is a bummer. You can build it right away but I suggest applying the stickers because without it, the car seems a little too red. You can opt not to apply them though.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Right away you&#39;ll recognise the model as being a Ferrari, and the stickers really made the vehicle stand out. I would have liked the tail to be a little more refined, but given the size I guess it&#39;s alright.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great little rendition of the F138 and I just love the pullback motor. Ditto for the overall design and provided stickers. Get it if you can find it for a decent price, because this is one racer that you will love to have on display.</p>

"Septim_s","2021-12-29T06:28:47.427Z","The Tiny Speedster","<p>I picked this up at one of the Shell stations recently as the promotion period has just started in Malaysia. I hope that you all could bear with me as this is my first review. Now on to the set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The polybag isn&#39;t really much to look at. It is pretty much what one would expect from a RM10-20 (USD 2.30-4.70). The front shows the F138 on a racetrack with the pullback motor function clearly shown on bottom right corner. The set includes an instruction sheet and a card wrapped separately in different plastic bag. The card simply showcases the six sets on one side with a link to Shell.com/LEGO which simply redirects you to their global products page. The instructions sheet also showcases their new line of products, albeit a lot more clearly.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5789/22732577662_60b218f635_o.jpg"" style=""height: 375px; width: 500px;"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 49&nbsp;parts in this set including 8 spare parts. This set has a few rare parts, including the pullback motor that has only been included in the Shell promotional sets. It does have a tendency to swerve to one side depending on which batch you get. Some work perfectly fine while others swerve and wobble a bit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are also four printed black rims with yellow outlining (element&nbsp;6083427: Rim Wide W.Hole &Oslash;8.1X9 &quot;No.1&quot;) which has only came out in this set up to the time of writing. There is also a printed nose wing which would come in handy if you wanted to make your own mini race track. This element (6081531: Formula 1 Front &quot;Nr. 3&quot;) only appears in this set.</p>

<p>Lastly, this set also contains a relatively rare element (6078640: Plate 1X1 W/Tooth). This element has previously only been available in two other Ninjago sets (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70727-1/X-1-Ninja-Charger"">70727:&nbsp;X-1 Ninja Charger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70748-1/Titanium-Dragon"">70748:&nbsp;Titanium Dragon</a>) which both have two of this element. So, considering that this set only costs the basic price of a polybag it is quite an inexpensive way to acquire this part.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are none included in this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing too difficult. However, the amount of stickers takes up quite a long time if you are a perfectionist who wants all the stickers to be aligned perfectly. However, it is quite understandable as this is a polybag, and the fact that we got four printed rims and the one unique front end (element&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6081531"">6081531</a>). I would suggest that you apply the stickers first before you build so that you can get them all straight. Without the stickers, it does look a bit too red.&nbsp;You can opt not to apply them though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It isn&#39;t really that great, but it is a considerable improvement over the 2012 version. Below are the comparisons between the 2012 and 2014 model:</p>

<h3>Overall opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>It is a great model for an affordable price range. A big bonus is the the rare elements contained in this polybag.&nbsp;Get it if you can find it for a decent price, because this is one of the best models in the whole Shell promotional range for 2014.</p>
