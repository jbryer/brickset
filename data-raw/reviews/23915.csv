"Septim_s","2015-11-30T12:35:32.11Z","The proud racer","<p>This is the third set in the Shell 2014/2015 promotional series. This vehicle, the Ferrari 250 GTO is definitely worth every cent of your money. Read on to see why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It is a standard polybag with the pullback motor function clearly shown in the bottom right portion. It showcases some fabulous artwork of a Ferrari testing track.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are also quite simple and easy to follow.<img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/593/23124584840_94024d654f_h.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with one relatively rare part and two extremely rare parts. Up to the date of writing, the element&nbsp;Angle Plate 1X2 / 2X4 (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4648084"">4648084</a>) has only appeared in two other sets, namely:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9485-1/Ultimate-Race-Set"">9485:&nbsp;Ultimate Race Set</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/4430-1/Fire-Transporter"">4430:&nbsp;Fire Transporter</a></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>These two sets only have one angle plate, making this the third set this element has appeared in. The roof (Roof/Top 4X5X1 1/3 No.1(<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6083870"">6083870</a>)) and the hood (Front 3X4X1 1/3 W/2 Knobs No.1(<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6083872"">6083872</a>) have only appeared in this set to date. There is also a pullback motor that has only been available in Shell sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple and very satisfying. However, you guys can be the judge of whether this car needs stickers to complete its look. Here&#39;s an image of the car with only the front sticker.<img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5747/22793183273_9419c28947_h.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks great. Lego has managed to get the scale right on this car. It definitely looks like the original.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you see this set, get it! You definitely won&#39;t regret it, unlike the&nbsp;40195-1: Shell Station which is completely horrible, which you can find out why in my previous review.</p>
