<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Coming in a polybag, instruction tiny folded but easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>54 bricks and 3 extra. Bricks are regular ones.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>1 included with nice accesories: Finish flag and Lap sign.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy to build, nothing special.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set consists of 2 seperate items, a finish line and a podium. the finish line remains unstable after built, if not placed on a larger base plate. Top and bottom parts come apart very easy. Podium is built on 2 quarter round plates, making it stable on all surfaces. The scale of the 2 items seems to differ.&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Set relies on stickers&nbsp;</span>for enhancing layout.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Avarage set, but fits nicely with the other polybags in the Shell/Ferrari promo.</p>
