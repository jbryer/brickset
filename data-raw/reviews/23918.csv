<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The polybag isn&#39;t really much to glance at. It is pretty much what one would expect from a Shell promotional set. It does succeed in making the set look larger than it really is.&nbsp;The set includes an instruction sheet and a card wrapped separately in different plastic bag. The card showcases the six sets on one side with a link to Shell.com/LEGO which simply redirects you to their global products page. The instructions sheet doesn&#39;t&nbsp;showcase&nbsp;their new line of products unlike the models in this line of promotional products.&nbsp;This set (40195)&nbsp;doesn&#39;t include a pullback motor, for obvious reasons.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 85&nbsp;parts in this set including six spare parts. This set has one relatively rare part, which is commonly used to portray a racing banner (element&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6055166"">6055166</a>). This element has only appeared in 2 other sets, namely&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/4842-1/Hogwarts-Castle"">4842:&nbsp;Hogwarts Castle</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8679-1/Tokyo-International-Circuit"">8679:&nbsp;Tokyo International Circuit</a> which only have one of this part each.&nbsp;So, considering that this set only costs the basic price of a polybag it is quite an inexpensive way to acquire this part without having to cough too much cash.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is only one minifigure included in this set, which is the Shell mechanic. Sadly the torso isn&#39;t a printed element, which is a shame since a printed element would have made this set much more desirable. However, it is quite easy to comprehend why LEGO would avoid printing the torso, as it would increase its manufacturing cost.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is quite mundane, boring and a three-year-old can manage it without any difficulty. The only problem is the sticker sheet, especially if you want to get all of them aligned properly.&nbsp;I would suggest that you apply the stickers first before you build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>So, this is supposed to be a Shell station... Hmm... The problem is, Shell stations don&#39;t leave their windows without glass panes for numerous reasons. I wonder why they couldn&#39;t have added a few more window panes.&nbsp;Besides, the other Shell mini models that have been advertised so extensively cannot pass through this Shell refueling station without incident. The studs in the middle make the cars unable to pass through smoothly if you do not pull the motor back sufficiently. In addition, the refueling pump faces outwards, so I wonder what the garage is for, perhaps for repair work, considering that the mechanic has a wrench in his hand. Lastly this Shell station seems to also act as a traffic light, considering the fact that there are lights by the side to indicate&nbsp;whose turn it is to move.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great parts pack, a sad imitation of the real thing. The lack of proper planning and the need to &#39;stuff as many functions into one building&#39; kind of concept ruins what could have been a perfectly logical set. Luckily, this set can be converted into a garage for the F1 cars provided in 2015&#39;s Speed Champions sets. If you have two of this sets and enough parts from your own collection it would make a nice garage, however as toy, it doesn&#39;t have&nbsp;much functions. So, if you&#39;re just looking for parts at a modest price, this is the set to get.</p>
