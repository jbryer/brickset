<p>Easy but cheap plastic bag. Quite the size though, compared to the prize. Very clear instruction, easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Very cool and sometimes even rare parts. Most of them very usable in own models you may want to build. A lot of parts for the size of the model. Big plus.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy enough. Nothing to it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks nice, doesn&#39;t fall apart very easy. Just the stuff on the backside (handle etc.) is too big for the rest of the truck.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good fun and value for money.</p>
