I believe during their purchases, this little set must have showed up as a freebie, since I really have no other idea how they would have acquired it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>So this is a polybag, but it is pretty large to accommodate&nbsp;one specific piece.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Yes this set includes an exclusive piece, a giant cardboard ice outcrop. Lego doesn&#39;t do cardboard pieces that often, and the last time I recal&nbsp;hearing about one this large was in the old Harry Potter sets. It is definitely an odd duck for sure. Also included are some other standard pieces for the Arctic theme, including a metallic colored crystal piece, a magnifying glass, and printed control panel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also there is a sticker sheet depicting accessory pieces available in other Arctic sets. I have no use for such a random sticker sheet,&nbsp;&nbsp;although kids might have fun slapping these stickers in random locations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no minifigures included.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A really quick build, the control panel is built quickly, and the small box with a crystal is built in less than a second. There are no revolutionary or interesting build styles here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Well, that cardboard iceberg piece is really ugly, it really doesn&#39;t mesh with the Lego style that well. The control panel looks cool and has found a home in my Star Wars Lego displays next to a Rebel Snowspeeder. The crystal box is being used as a parts source.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really don&#39;t know what to do with this model. If I had some Arctic sets I would imagine this set would be more interesting. I find it an odd choice that Lego included a cardboard iceberg and stickers, when a minifigure would have made this a much more interesting set. Still, the control panel is a fun display piece; and getting a Lego crystal piece is always fun, although the rest of the set kind of deserves to be iced.&nbsp;</p>
