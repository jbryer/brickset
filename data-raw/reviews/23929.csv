<p>Ah, Dareth. A favorite of many Ninjago fans. It was only during Season 2 of the TV series&nbsp;in 2012 that we were introduced to this blowhard&nbsp;and&nbsp;his dojo, students, and antics. Providing comic relief, Dareth has since&nbsp;become a worthy addition to Ninjago&#39;s&nbsp;expanding universe. Now that he finally has a physical version, what do I have to say about it?</p>

<p>The packaging is really&nbsp;nothing special. Just a polybag, with the branding of this year&#39;s Rebooted line of&nbsp;sets. I would save it, though, as it&#39;s exclusive. I tried not to damage mine, and I think I succeeded.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that unlike most polybags, this one has no instructions. And to be honest, you won&#39;t need them.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not&nbsp;sure how useful the parts would be outside of a Ninjago setting. However, the trophy (a fake, commissioned&nbsp;one in this case!) is new to me, and should prove to be pretty useful.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Dareth: </strong>He&#39;s fresh! He&#39;s exclusive! The printing quality is terrific, and very closely matches his look in the show, if not exact. It&#39;s slightly upsetting that he doesn&#39;t have a double sided face, though.</p>

<p><b>Nindroid&nbsp;Warrior:&nbsp;</b>Pretty common, but great&nbsp;as an army-builder.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build literally takes about thirty seconds, if you&#39;re fast at assembling minifigures. I would say it were boring if it weren&#39;t so fast.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model isn&#39;t entirely breathtaking. You&nbsp;get two minifigures, a weapon, and an accessory (or is the trophy a weapon? You decide!).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would definitely try to get this polybag if you can find it. I ordered mine online, which seems like an easy option if you can&#39;t hunt one down in-store. I would have given a higher score if there was some more substance. Ignoring that...&nbsp;for&nbsp;five bucks, you get a very&nbsp;nice exclusive.&nbsp;I thoroughly enjoy this set,&nbsp;if not only for Dareth! Recommended.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>For free this is well worth it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Dareth is apparently a fan favorite character and this is the only way to get him. He has double-sided printing on his torso and leg printing and includes a brown version of the mechanic&rsquo;s hairpiece from the CMF series. Sweet looking figure.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Nindroid is another sweet minifig, it&rsquo;s got a double-sided torso and leg printing, plus a nice new ninja mask sculpt, including a mechanical eye scanner thing over one eye.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Large trophy included.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Buying this on the secondary market unfortunately is way too costly for the contents.</li>
	<li>Limited accessories for the minifigures, Dareth has no weapons and the Nindroid only comes with a single sai, for a giveaway polybag it makes sense, however it might have been nice to include a small weapons rack build to bulk up the piece count.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d say this is a decent enough polybag for free, if you have to pay for it though I&rsquo;d suggest being very picky as to what you want to pay for it. Dareth alone isn&rsquo;t a big enough draw to spend anything more than 15$ for it maximum, including the shipping. There aren&rsquo;t enough weapons for a Ninjago set, and the lack of any actual build element makes it a bit bland. Recommended with caution.</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-17T04:59:34.043Z","We finally get the Brown Ninja","<p>It&#39;s a perfect little Polybag. How often do we get one with 2 figures? This contains Dareth, the Brown Ninja, and owner of the Mojo Dojo. He is gloriously printed in his brown gi with big honking medallion and slicked back pompadour. He comes with one of his infamous &quot;fake&quot; Kung Fu trophys. Also in this set is a Nindroid armed with Sai. All around a great little value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was a Toys R Us exclusive set. There is a newer version of Dareth found in the 2015 D2C Temple of Airjitsu set as well.&nbsp;</p>
