<p>Great looking book from Dorling/Kindersley that features all about the Dark Side.</p>

<p>The Book is split into 3 chapters: The Republic Era, The Clone Wars Era and The Emperial Era, and each of these chapters focus on different aspects about the Dark Side, for example &#39;Man Becomes Machine.<br />
Also each part talks about&nbsp;the Enemies and the Allies of the Sith in that Era.</p>

<p>Lastly a lot of questions are answered, for example &#39;Can a Sith Lord be Redeemed&#39;.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This book features a magnificent Darth Sidious minifigure with great detailing and a tan skin.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While the book gives a very pleasant and sometimes really in-depth&nbsp;view on the Dark Side, it is almost a Lego-catalog, featuring lots of things that are not really related to the Dark Side but are put in there to show to the readers.</p>

<p>Overall I think this is a great book, giving a fantastic minifigure and very pleasant to read.</p>

AFOLs may prefer picking this up mostly for the chance at getting Emperor Palpatine&rsquo;s new Minifigure in a much cheaper manner than the larger expensive sets he is typically found in.</p>

<p>Presentation</p>

<p>This title is all dark. By which of course that I mean the Theme of the Dark Side is black and red and the book&rsquo;s covers are black. This stands out amongst the other typical books published by DK which relies more heavily on white covers. With Darth Vader front and centre on the front of this book there&rsquo;s no doubt what you&rsquo;ll find here.</p>

<p>Much like The Yoda Chronicles it is a nicely constructed title with a very fun looking page layout that younger readers will enjoy. The only issues is the length of this title with its price, 17.99$ for a hard cover book of this size does seem like a bit pricey when you consider just what the content is here.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Emperor Palpatine: A brand new Palpatine is included with this book, sharing a print from the Death Star Final Duel set this Emperor has a double-sided facial print with limited differences in the expressions, one side is more neutral while the other is angry. He has single sided printing on his torso and his legs and includes a black cape and hood head piece. He&rsquo;s a decent representation of the character with a colour for his hands and face being something like pale, pale tan. Or possibly a very dull white, I&rsquo;m not very good at distinguishing the colour, all I do know is it suits him much better than past Palpatine skin tones.</p>

<p>Contents</p>

<p>95 pages in three chapters, and the material in this book is mostly written from the perspective of an in-universe LEGO Star Wars style. Showing off the Prequel Era and the Clone Wars separately and then focusing on the Empire, the book includes pages of write-ups on everything from Darth Lords to The Allies, Foot Soldiers and Enemies of the Sith.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s rather difficult to be as informative as I can without spoiling the contents, honestly it is an interesting read, but as I said very much more for younger fans of LEGO Star Wars.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend picking this up for your younger readers, it&rsquo;s written well, looks fun and shows a lot of great imagery of LEGO Star Wars sets and Minifigures in fun, playful ways. Older fans will probably only be interested in the Palpatine Minifigure, who looks spectacular and definitely stands up as one of the best versions of the character made so far. AFOLs will mostly want to steer clear of it, especially for its price, unless they are really gung ho for completing everything LEGO Star Wars collection wise.</p>
