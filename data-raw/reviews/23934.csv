<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Easy to follow instructions</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Too much concrete parts, you can assemble a bike, or a bike a good deal of spares, it&#39;s fun how the old pneumatic T distributors are the bike stands</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A new (at the time)&nbsp;design policeman, helmet with visor, only one face, leather pants and jacket. Also a walkie&nbsp;transmitter is included</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Much simplified, you assemble the frame and the body of the bike, 2 parts and got the 80% done, stickers are nice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks awesome, even if it&#39;s quite big for a bike, I suppose it&#39;s a BMW kind of bike.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I liked it, even if simple (it&#39;s my most modern set, and already assembled +1000 part models) looks nice and is a cheap and neat addition for a city.</p>

<p>Although the set is small, it has a good minifigure and a good vehicle.</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>Good little figure</p>

<p>Good vehicle</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>Nothing</p>

<p>This was my first set and it was him who made me know LEGO.<br />
It is a very good set to add to a collection and to a city.<br />
It may be small but the design is good as is the minifigure which is my favorite minifigure of LEGO.</p>

<p>I highly recommend buying this set.</p>
