"matison01","2017-06-01T14:38:12.44Z","Great baseplate for building","<p>I currently have 2 of these and I like them very much. It&#39;s 48 by 48 studs, which is much bigger than other baseplates available from lego. It can be used to build or showcase your lego creations. A downside is that it easily bends and you have to be careful not to break it. The price is very good. Overall I would recommend this Lego baseplate to other Lego fans!</p>

<p>I have 8 of these 48&#39;48 baseplates now, and I must say, I just love them. &nbsp;They have quite a bit of space on them and the studs (only on top, no&nbsp;bottom connection points) make for a great building surface for sets, display surface or starting point for your own creations. &nbsp;The light-blueish grey color is really the best choice and coordinates&nbsp;with almost anything. &nbsp;Kids will love having a Lego landscape specifically for posing minifigures&nbsp;and&nbsp;vehicles in ways that they would not normally balance (I loved this when I was younger) and it&nbsp;really helps make their Lego&nbsp;building experience much easier than a carpet or table. &nbsp;Just have all your pieces on this plate and easily pick your project&nbsp;up and move it around instead of tossing everything into a bucket. &nbsp;Right now I currently use these baseplates for diorama building and displaying models.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>No connection points on the bottom of this thing, but that&#39;s a minor bug. &nbsp;The plate does bend and can break if handled too roughly, but that&#39;s never happened to me. &nbsp;$15 is a lot for just one, and this is one case where buying some knockoff&nbsp;baseplates&nbsp;might actually be worth it for most buyers, even though bricks&nbsp;might not connect to one&nbsp;quite as naturally. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I very much recommend this &#39;set&#39; to all fans of Lego and it will help quite a lot in your Lego endeavors.</p>

What&#39;s confusing about this set is even though it is one piece, the packaging states, &#39;<em>components made in Denmark, Hungary, Mexico, Austria, and the Czech Republic&#39;</em></p>

<p>Crikey!&nbsp;I wonder where they are made.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T23:26:38.23Z","A good thing to build a MOC on","<p>This is what you get if you want to build a MOC or a base. Its bigger than the green or blue baseplates and is in the monotone light gra which makes for the perfect color of flooring for a base. I highly recommend getting this for anyone who owns LEGO.</p>

"VictorJiangKiangLiangMiang","2021-10-15T23:12:55.59Z","Lego Grey Baseplate Review- Straightforwardly simple yet nice","<p>Lego has released numerous sets but the one evoking the most curiosity is the grey baseplate. On the surface, it appears extremely simple, and the price of $14.99 USA dollars and $19.99 Australian dollars certainly appears to be extremely overpriced. But why is this set still so popular? The question revolves around MOC value.</p>

<p>Lego&#39;s&nbsp;baseplates invoke substantial nostalgia considering the relative scarcity of them included in sets nowadays. However, the grey one is much more useful than the green and blue one, which only caters for ocean/grassland biomes and appears extremely unrealistic for constructions of buildings and tiles on the first floor is indispensable for accuracy! Fortunately, the grey one would appear excellent in a City street, and despite tiling improving the interior of any buildings constructed with this base, it is sufficient to stand on its own.</p>

<p><br />
The size of this baseplate is extremely visible- 100 of my Minifigures can stand in here with some room still left. Furthermore, the size is larger than 10255, the largest modular (32 by 48 studs), hence this baseplate provides sufficient room to build an entire neighbourhood!</p>

<p>However, the larger footprint of this baseplate unfortunately renders the price to be increased up to $14.99 USA dollars or $19.99 Australian dollars, which is extraordinarily overpriced since that a small individualised set can be acquired for the same price. However, given this set&#39;s tremendous MOC appeal I would recommend this to AFOLs who wish to customise their own city, but this set does not&nbsp;stand on its own, hence difficult for me to give a higher rating.&nbsp;</p>
