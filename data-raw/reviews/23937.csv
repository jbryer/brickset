<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box comes covered with the standard Elves design and additional shaping that can also be found on the Friends and Disney Princesses lines. I am glad that LEGO went with a dark blue rather than a more stereotypically &#39;girly&#39; colour like the other themes mentioned.</p>

<p>The instructions, as with most LEGO sets, were well laid out and easy to follow, although there were a few steps I found myself a little bit blind to which grey I was after at what point.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The selection of parts in this set is fantastic. As well as having several&nbsp;of the Elves exclusive coloured tree elements it has several more generic parts that are harder to come by, such as a trans light blue minifigure head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thinking solely in terms of parts this set could be a great parts pack for any castle builders, there are lots og grey parts, including several slopes and arches. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minidolls</h3>

<p>While the set only comes with one minidoll - Naida, who is identical to her appearance in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/41073-1/Naida-s-Epic-Adventure-Ship"">set 41073</a>&nbsp;Naida&#39;s&nbsp;Epic&nbsp;Adventure&nbsp;Ship - it also features a Medium Lavendar&nbsp;Dolphin, which is exclusive to this set. I&#39;m a big fan of moulded animal pieces, and as the Elves cartoon features the animals as named characters I am of the opinion that they count to the minidoll count.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The vast majority of the build is fairly straightforward, expect a lot of straight stacking of bricks. A lot of people are put off by this kind of build but I actually really enjoyed it in this case. I think that it&#39;s helped by the fact that the build is very asymmetric, meaning that the repetitive&nbsp;feel of some builds isn&#39;t an issue as there isn&#39;t much in the way of repeated sections.</p>

<p>There is one very satisfying part of the build that creates a nice play feature, the branch at the top right of the model is a lever that releases a hidden map. I have to admit that as I was building this I felt like it wasn&#39;t going to work, the mechanism didn&#39;t make much sense to me until it was completed, at which point I felt a little foolish for questioning it at all.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While this set is never going to be seen as an amazing display piece or an example of groundbreaking design, it does exactly what it sets out to do. It looks like a natural spring type spa, and has a couple of nice play features for kids who want some scenery for their Elves to play in.</p>

<p>Some of the parts do look like they could use a better finish - e.g the red and blue studs that presumably represent hot and cold taps look very out of place against the rest of the colour scheme, in a magical world I think silver would have looked nicer. This is all rather minor in the big picture though.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Here I have to bring up my big criticism with the Elves theme and this set in particular - It&#39;s essentially the same content as Friends but dressed up with a magical setting. It hits this set in particular as a spa doesn&#39;t really feel very conductive to an adventure based story, except perhaps as a place for the heroes to go to rest up after their travels. However it has not been used as such, it&#39;s used as a place Naida seems to essentially live - meaning that the spa does little for any story, and is just a random location, so why choose a spa?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to get into the ins and outs of gendered marketing but I do feel that making choices like this can lead to unnecessary&nbsp;criticism that could be avoided by having made this a dock -&nbsp;to link better to the Boat set. I actually find the choice of a Spa because it&#39;s a theme aimed at girls to be massively patronising, and I hope that LEGO avoid this kind of gender stereotyping in themes that are set in alternate worlds - I am prepared to accept the &#39;realism&#39; arguments of what girls like for themes like Friends or City where the aim is to mimic real life to a certain extent - but in a world of magical elves I think LEGO should really let their imagination run free and come up with something more original.</p>

<p>To my mind this set is probably the low point of this theme, but for all my complaining about content,&nbsp;it&#39;s still not a bad set and like most of the Elves line pretty good value for money.</p>

<p>It went quite well till I started building the mechanism for finding the map. If you&#39;re reading this review but don&#39;t have the set, go to More Images and find one where you can see a brown Technic piece with a lavender branch on it. That controls the map mechanism and it&#39;s very hard to build. Other wise, though, it wnt good.</p>

<p><strong><em>Play</em></strong></p>

<p>I can play out the bit in Naida&#39;s caves from Quest for the Keys in this set! Yes!</p>

<p><strong><em>Cave</em></strong></p>

<p>It has a shower! How cool is that! And soap and shampoo!</p>

<p><strong><em>Spa</em></strong></p>

<p>I really like all the different spa attachments. I got a 1x1 clear round piece and stuck it on a mirror piece, then I put it underneath the smaller branch so now I have a floating mirror next to where Naida would brush her hair. So. Cool.</p>
