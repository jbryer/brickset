<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Nice sand green pieces. I love the ornate fencing and the roof on the tree house.</p>

<p>- It actually looks like a tree house, other than the lack of foliage. Speaking of which, I love the new purple and lavender colors. It adds a lot of fantasy to these sets.</p>

<p>- The barrel pulley is fun. Quite simple to build, but adds a lot for play value.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- I would like it more enclosed. From the front it looks like a nice tree house, but when you turn it around, it feels incomplete.</p>

<p>- Dark red tree is different, but I like the new re-colored pieces.</p>

<p>- The bridge mechanism seems unrealistic. You can use it as a ladder and then push the bar and make it a bridge, but in reality it wouldn&#39;t work like that. But it&#39;s LEGO, not reality.</p>

<p>- I don&#39;t understand the medium azure plate on the right side. It looks like a small waterfall and stream leading into the larger lake, but it feels forced. Maybe if there was dark gray rocks along the sides it would feel more like a stream, but as it is, it is above the grass and doesn&#39;t fit right.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>From a play value standpoint, this is a fun set. I like the features included. I would like to see it fleshed out a bit more with more foliage and more side walls to give it a full tree house feel while still allowing play room from the back. I would recommend picking it up if you can find it. But I know it was in an earlier wave, so supply may be limited.</p>

This set is brilliant for play as you can re-enacting the scene where Emily Jones comes through the portal.</p>

<p>Overall a great set for play and display!</p>
