One giant leap for the mixels theme.","<p>I&#39;ve been a big fan of the Mixels theme since it came out last year my favorite tribe being the Spikels. But I found this little spaceman (or should I say Spacemixel) and his brethren Nurp-Naut to be right up there with them on the top of the list.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like the other sets in the theme Rokit comes in a foil packet. The only problem I have with the packets is they smell really bad! Thankfully the packet is the only thing that smells.</p>

<p>the instructions are easy to read and the only step I had trouble with was number twelve where you put the 1X2 plate with 3 teeth and the lime green bowed plates on the 2X2 plate. I accidentally put them on angular plate instead of the 2x2.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I love the fact that they used the lime green with the Orbitons. Since it&#39;s not very common.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are none unless you count the Nixel.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Like the other Mixels this was a quick five minute build. But it was a fun build none the less.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This guy has the best looking jetpack of the Orbitons and the little bit of greebling on his head with dome piece makes him look like he has a computer brain. this is also the one of the three Orbitons with a Nixel and they finally made a new design for it. Unlike its predecessors the new Nixel has articulation in the arms.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was originally just going skip this series and wait for series 5 to be released but this set (along with 41529) changed my mind about series 4. so I highly recommend picking this guy up you won&#39;t regret it!</p>

"NBJ2016","2015-09-18T20:45:14.837Z","41527: Rokit","<p>Rokit was one of the first Series 4 Mixels I bought, as I thought he would be a nice addition to my complete collection of 2014 Mixels. I didn&#39;t regret buying him, and although he is certainly not my favourite Mixel in my collection, he is one of the best little models I&#39;ve ever bought.</p>

<p><strong><em>Packaging and Instructions...</em></strong></p>

<p>The packaging shows Rokit &quot;flying&quot; away from the Mixel Moon. The cartoon image of him is present, along with the LEGO, Mixels, Series 4 and CN logos. Age range and set number also appear. The barcode and usual warnings appear on the back of the packet.</p>

<p>The instructions are 24 pages long, and advertise Series 4, the Orbitronz combination model, and the Mixels TV Series. A nice fireman appears on the back of the booklet, letting us all know that we can WIN a &quot;cool LEGO prize&quot; if we give feedback on TLG&#39;s customer service website.</p>

<p><em><strong>Parts</strong></em></p>

<p>The first thing you realize when opening the bags that contain the parts is that there is a good amount of Bright Yellowish-Green. MOCers are going to be pleased at the rest of the parts assortment, which is good for either building aliens or landscapes. A few black parts are included too, to build Rokit&#39;s body and a Nixel.</p>

<p><strong><em>The build</em></strong></p>

<p>The build is over quickly, and very enjoyable, as all the Mixels sets are. The body is constructed first, then the face is connected. The jetpack and arms appear next, and then the dome on top of Rokit&#39;s head. Finally, the legs are added, and then the Nixel is built.</p>

<p><em><strong>The completed model</strong></em></p>

<p>Rokit is a very satisfying build. The arms and legs are connected to ball joints, so lots of functionality there. The overall look of the model is very well done, and he looks friendly, maybe even cute. The Nixel is a new design for 2015, and a nice little thing, giving some playability to the model, especially for kids who watch the TV series. In the TV series, Rokit absolutely hates Nixels, and will stop at nothing to destroy them, so I think most kids will get a good fight out of this one. It&#39;s a very sturdy model too, and so it can be thrown about without breaking easily. The most that will happen is that the dome will fall off his head, and the rods will ping off if played with a little <em>too</em> roughly. There really isn&#39;t any design flaw in this model.</p>

<p><em><strong>Overall opinion</strong></em></p>

<p>TLG tried and succeeded in making a sturdy model for kids that looks great on display. The model feels like it&#39;s a sci-fi one, and I&#39;m pleased about that. It&#39;s supposed to be a friendly space-creature with a military air. It looks like that, and TLG have shown us that they can make durable models that look amazing, and give us the idea of what LEGO is all about. Overall, if it isn&#39;t already obvious, I love this model and hope we&#39;ll see more like it in the future.</p>

<p><strong><em>My Rating: 10 / 10.</em></strong></p>
