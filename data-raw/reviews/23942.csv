<p>This my only mixel and I really appreciate the cartoony design and effort put in to make him unique .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>Starting with the head the is a 2&times;2 trans white dome over his single eye and a black fin on his head and below he has his sharp teeth , wing arms and torso which is all greatly built . The torso has a very nice tiled front and towards the back there is a clip with the standard Lego flame coming out to represent her propulsion . His legs like the arms are attached via some mini ball joints and the feet are nicely sloped and have a 1&times;2 pearl gold grill tile on the front of each foot&nbsp; for extra detail .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>mixels wasn&#39;t a theme for me but I do appreciate the amount of effort put in to make each character unique I am glad to own this and would recommend it to any fans of weird and cartoony Lego figs and builds .&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great building experience as it&#39;s an interesting Mixel due to the Space theme.&nbsp;Good parts such as the dome piece, plane piece, and variety of colors.&nbsp;Ok playability from the limb movements, mouth, and fire tail. Good value also as it&#39;s a Mixel that looks good. Gives Transformers vibes.</p>
