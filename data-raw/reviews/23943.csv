<p>It was as if the original idea was a kind of funny joke, but it kept on being made over and over again, and I stopped laughing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Nurp-Naut does have some fine parts.&nbsp; It&#39;s got two four-by-four round plates in light bley , which I&#39;m very fond of.&nbsp; Nice lime green slopes and other assorted parts, and I can&#39;t really ever get enough parts in lime green.&nbsp; And it has white fangs and gold clips and eyeballs -- SO many eyeballs!&nbsp; In addition to the big 2x2 round tile with a sleepy eye shown in all the pictures, the set comes with a total of three (two for the build, one extra) eyeballs on 1x1 round tiles.&nbsp; So when it comes to eyeballs, you&#39;re all set.</p>

<p>Plus -- the piece de resistance, I think -- there are two transparent black hemispheres, which fit over the round plates like space helmets.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn&#39;t really see this on the illustrations, so I wasn&#39;t as drawn to this set as I would have been if I&#39;d been sure of them.&nbsp; They are really useful pieces!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>However, the thing that delighted me most about this excellent set was the build, which was quite amazing.&nbsp; Mixels in general do a pretty great job of building in three dimensions within a very small space, and the torso of the figure was no exception, but the really great thing to build was the head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It uses six L-shaped inverted brackets plus 2x2 bricks to build a shape that&#39;s basically a tall box with symmetrical arrays of studs all over the place.&nbsp; Then it slaps the round plates on two opposite sides, equips each of those sides with eyeballs and a hemisphere, and adds corner slopes topped with red 1x1 rounds on the remaining two sides as ears, and a 2x2 lime jumper plate with an antenna on the top.&nbsp; And then, just to make the whole thing a fiesta, it puts that head assembly down on the torso with a turntable, so the head can spin around to show the two faces, as you please.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As you can probably tell, I really really like this Mixel.&nbsp; It&#39;s my favorite by far of all the series, and is totally worth the asking price, in my view.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, I think you should get two for the spare parts.&nbsp; Just saying.&nbsp; :)</p>

"Trigger_","2017-02-20T22:38:07.813Z","Not the Best Mixel in my Opinion, but Nurp-Naut does his Job","<p>Nurp-Naut is a&nbsp;plenarily incipient kind of Mixel with two heads and a dual personality. The incipient eyeball pieces used here will appeal to monster makers, and the concept of a reversible face works extremely well, so I love the head in general. Once again I would relish it if those domes were transparent, but the rest of the color culls work super nicely.</p>

<p>Apart from the face, Nurp-Naut is an extremely basic figure, with hinged arms and ball-jointed feet. The feet are&nbsp;not subsidiary at all for posing the Mixel as they are super proximate to his body, but you can balance him on one foot if you choose. The rocket pack looks good on this character additionally, as does his alternate, two-eyed head. This head ostensibly represents the personality of a kid, while the other is that of a smart elder.</p>

<p>Other than the lack of joints my only reprehension for Nurp-Naut would be his alternate binocular face. I cerebrate a mouth should be included beneath the dome as the two eyeballs alone do not fill the helmet prosperously at all.&nbsp;It avails convey the childlike inability to blame this personality, but I am still unconvinced by it in terms of appearance and will be displaying him with the sizable eyeball&nbsp;visible.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Nurp-Naut is probably the worst Orbiton, but as good as Boogly.</p>
