"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-07-12T19:50:09.3Z","Quick Mini Review","<p>Meltus&nbsp;is the first of the Series 4 Mixels of the&nbsp;Infernites Tribe.This is the second appearance of the Infernites Tribe, they were the first tribe of Series 1. <em>I missed Series 1, so I can&#39;t really make comparisons.</em></p>

<p>Meltus looks great - his head has the look of a dragon (something I&#39;m a fan of - see <span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span>my review of 31032!). He has a great face, with excellent eyebrows.</p>

<p>Lots of red pieces, with dark red (New Dark Red) and transparent orange decorative bits. Moderate articulation with ball&amp;sockets and clips.</p>

<p>Quick build time&nbsp;4&frac12; minutes.</p>

<p>A variety of articulations, and a really great dragon head, make this a great Mixel, I like him and this tribe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are amazing for the (used to be) price, and the playability is awesome. It makes a cool-looking Dinosaur and a Mixel at the same time. I originally bought this set for the Infernites Max, but I really like the way it came out!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Negatives: The pieces that hold the eyebrows up can be taken apart like once or twice before you have to buy a replacement. It breaks VERY easily.</p>

<p>Positives: Pretty much everything else.</p>
