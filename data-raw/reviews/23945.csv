<p>Flamzer seems like a little fiery demon. His articulation is primarily from clips, the only ball&amp;sockets are for his big flamey tail.</p>

<p>There are a good variety of parts in this tribes red, dark red and tr.orange colours. A good selection of clips and bars. The big flame piece is &#39;cool&#39; and useful.</p>

<p>Quick build time&nbsp;a little under 4 minutes, including a Nixel.</p>

<p>He&#39;s the least interesting Mixel of the Infernite tribe, with the least articulation. There are good parts in the set though.</p>
