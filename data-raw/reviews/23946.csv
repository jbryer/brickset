"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-07-12T20:46:19.81Z","Quick Mini Review","<p>Burnard&nbsp;is the third of the Series 4 Mixels of the&nbsp;Infernites Tribe.</p>

<p>He looks really fantastic, great expression, cool eye construction and a big&nbsp;flaming tongue. He looks like mischevious trouble.</p>

<p>Lots of dark red and trans-orange decorative parts, the big flame piece, red flat hinges and those eye constructions look useful.</p>

<p>Quick build time just over&nbsp;3&frac12; minutes.</p>

<p><em>Note: The inventory in the instructions is incorrect (the Brickset parts list is fine). It lists 1x Red Roof Tile 1x2 - when there are 2, and&nbsp; 1x Roof Tile 1x1x2/3 - when there are 6. Most of these are used on his feet, which can be clearly seen in his picture!</em></p>

<p>Burnard is my favourite Infernite and would be quite high on my overall list. He looks like so much fun.</p>

<h3>Infernites&nbsp;Max</h3>

<p>This Max (a combination of the 3 members of the tribe) is pretty chunky. His tail and flaming tongue are connected by a&nbsp;small sliding construction through the middle of his body. I&#39;m not quite sure what that&#39;s supposed to represent.&nbsp; He is fun with plenty of articulation, but he does seems like a bit of a mish mash from the parts.</p>

<p>Quick build time just&nbsp;over 7&frac12; minutes.</p>

The inexpensive series are bringing new parts for very little expenses. Despite being very MOCable, is the set decent? This is Burnard from series 4 mixels.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes in a recyclable plastic bag that is hard to keep intact if you want to preserve the packaging. The instructions are a 23 page easy to follow guide. These are folded over in the bag.</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>The set has no minifigs.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Most of the parts are red with a few white pieces. The best piece is the long yellow and red flame. Some pieces are transparent. There are no stickers.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>The build is quite simple, taking between 5 and 7 minutes.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>His arms can move 85 degrees. His eyes can also be rotated. There is a huge flame coming out of his mouth.</p>

<p>What more could you want from a &pound;3 ($4) collectible set? One of the best the in the series.</p>
