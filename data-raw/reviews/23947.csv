<p>Globert is fun, he has limited articulation (feet and wings) and his head rocks to open/close his mouth. The earth blue wings are also a great part.</p>

<p>Quick build time 3 minutes. Globert does have a lower than average number of pieces.</p>

<p>I like the Glowkies; Earth Blue is a really good colour, the Aqua &#39;cheese wedges&#39; are&nbsp;a&nbsp;good quantity of a useful decorative part in a rare colour. I also like the Halloween theme. The glow in the dark pieces are fun, and the main focus of the tribes theme.</p>

<p>The limited articulation does limit their posability and playability.</p>
