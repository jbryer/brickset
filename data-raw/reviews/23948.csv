<p>Vampos is a vampire-bat Mixel, which is pretty cool. As with the other members of the tribe, there is limited articulation - wings, feet and a ball&amp;socket jointed head.</p>

<p>Good earth blue parts, aqua &#39;cheese slopes&#39;, black teeth and mini wings.</p>

<p>One thing to note, the large glow in the dark fangs are made of a soft flexible plastic</p>

<p>Quick build time 3&frac12; minutes, including a Nixel.</p>

<p>Vampos is fun, but like the other Glowkies, his limited articulation does limit his posability and playability.</p>
