"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-07-11T22:22:22.74Z","Quick Mini Review","<p>Boogly&nbsp;is the&nbsp;third of the Series 4 Mixels of the Glowkies Tribe.&nbsp;Boogly has glow in the dark minifig-head eye piece.</p>

<p>Boogly is a dog like Mixel with tarantula tentacle like ears. He is mainly dark Earth Blue, with a load of the aqua &#39;cheese slopes&#39; and some great teeth. He also has quite limited articulation, but probably the most of the Glowkies.</p>

<p>Quick build time 2&frac12; minutes.</p>

<p>I like Boogly, he&#39;s my favourite of this tribe.</p>

<h3>Glowkies Max</h3>

<p>This Max (a combination of the 3 members of the tribe) has an impressive array of teeth, 2 sets of wings (although they don&#39;t seem like enough to get him off the ground), and big feet. He&#39;s pretty cool, and probably greater than the sum of his parts. He has the same relatively limited articulation as the individual members of the tribe.</p>

<p>Quick build time just under 6&frac12; minutes. A moderate number of pieces are left over.</p>

"Trigger_","2017-02-20T22:32:24.833Z","Good Set, but if you Compared it to Other Mixels, not Perfect","<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>The spider leg antennae look superb around his glowing eyeball, which has a toque on top&nbsp;as an eyelid.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Like all quadrupedal Mixels, Boogly suffers from horrible&nbsp;articulation. His rear legs can only move out from the body while his forelegs are hinged, so they only move forward and backwards.</li>
	<li>I am hate those exposed studs on either side of his body.</li>
	<li>The only Glow-In-The-Dark part is the eye, which is much smaller than any other glowing part in any other Glowkie.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>A good set, not even&nbsp;a bad Mixel, but only as good as Dribbal.</p>
