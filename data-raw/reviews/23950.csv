Unfortunately the scale is not great so it doesn&#39;t fit too well. This maybe a good set for kids progressing from Lego to Technic though.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Small box, usual high quality that is expected from a Technic set. The instruction book is clear and standard quality.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing especially exciting to be found here. A few white parts are nice to have as these are not so common, and the angled connector elements are useful parts to have.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Technic sets have no minifigures - and this set is so small one couldn&#39;t even fit anyway!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Extremely simple build. I can&#39;t make that point clear&nbsp;enough. If anyone has ever had Technic experience before and understand the basics of the system, they will find this build a breeze and to be honest, pretty uninspiring.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Small. Very, very small. I can hold this in the palm of my hand, that&#39;s how small it is. If anything I am amazed Lego managed to fit 155 parts into such a tiny space! The single action feature (raising and lowering the arm and bucket)&nbsp;works just fine - although be careful not to fit parts too tightly together otherwise the bucket gets stuck in position - it needs gravity to keep it facing down.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>To be honest, I was disappointed. I wanted to grow my construction crew but the scale is so far off it looks ridiculous next to the other models. I feel this may be a nice &#39;stocking filler&#39; type set for a 9-10 year old who has never used Technic before. Anyone else would probably find better value with other sets.</p>

The theory of operation (where a dial operates the crane from a horizontal to a vertical position), is easy to understand for beginners, because there is a limited number of moving parts, and they are all visible, so the user can see what is going on behind the scenes as they operate the dial.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>Nothing to note about the box or instructions, they are of the usual high quality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>This set extensively uses Technic pieces, but the actual parts that make the crane operational are small and easy to understand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>No minifigures are included, and wouldn&#39;t be practical at this scale.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>In my experience, Technic sets are generally more difficult to assemble than typical bricks. But within the scope of this being a Technic model, this would be a beginner&#39;s set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>This is a small set, so don&#39;t expect it to be able to compete with larger or minifig scales. Because of the simplicity of the moving parts, and because the crane is light, it is very easy to operate the dial and does not take many revolutions to move it from one end of its range to the other.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>This set is a great value, and a great introduction to Technic. It will likely spark interest in taking on larger and more technically complex Technic sets. &nbsp;It also offers some reusability in that it can be reassembled from a Cherry Picker, to a Tow Truck, and vice versa.</p>

"BarbossaThePianist","2016-04-02T03:30:03.253Z","Great Set","<p>The Cherry Picker is a great set mostly for it&#39;s durability and moving parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are easy to follow, as always.</p>

<p>Very smart use of parts; I especially liked the basket build.</p>

<p>I would suggest this set for all ages.</p>

"Jeepetti","2016-12-12T20:56:39.85Z","Bite-sized fun","<p>This mini cherry picker was simple yet remained fun to build. Sometimes I don&#39;t feel like sorting and organizing hundreds of pieces before being able to begin building a model. The mini sets allow you to quickly organize and begin assembly. It did not take very long to assemble but was enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>
