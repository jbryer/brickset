<p>This set should be at the top of your Swamp Police list (okay, maybe co-top with 60070 Water Plane Chase).&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; First, the vehicles are simply awesome.&nbsp; The highlight would have to be the half-track.&nbsp; I cannot recall Lego ever previously releasing a half-track in the City or Town (or indeed any) theme.&nbsp; As a &quot;baddie vehicle&quot; it has both entertainment value and functionality, to combine for overall fantastic playability.&nbsp; The chassis construction is also very sturdy and it&#39;s easy to imagine the big diesel engine growling away as this monster smashes its way through the bayou on its way to the hideout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hovercraft is also loads of fun.&nbsp; This vehicle features a brick-built skirt rather than a rubber one (as some previous Lego hovercraft have featured) but this does not diminish the set&#39;s looks.&nbsp; It&#39;s not perfect: it lacks the ingenious hidden swivelling wheel steering mechanism&nbsp;of 7045 Hovercraft Hideout, which allowed very hovercraft-like movement.&nbsp; Instead, five slide shoes on the underside of the hovercraft do the job.&nbsp; The result is still quite satisfactory.&nbsp; Likewise, pedants will bemoan the fact that the hovercraft&#39;s twin fans are unable to&nbsp;move to steer&nbsp;the hovercraft.&nbsp; Again, this is not really an issue for playability purposes.</p>

<p>The crooks&#39; treehouse hideaway is quite adequate but does not feature the same level of&nbsp;detail or functionality&nbsp;as the vehicles.&nbsp; A trap door or some sort of hidden hidey-hole would have been nice but I suspect would have blown Lego&#39;s budget for the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three minifigures is about the right number for this set.&nbsp; The minifigs themselves are nothing special - two crooks and a Police officer with the standard modern headpieces/beards and torso (not leg) printing.&nbsp; Hovercraft and half-track provide a good array of tools for the minifigs to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is also very noteworthy for parts.&nbsp; Thanks to the hovercraft, it contains a massive&nbsp;<u>26</u> 1x3x2 black bow bricks and two corners.&nbsp; That&#39;s enough for some serious roof edging for a building MOC in your city.&nbsp; There is also an impressive array of vehicle elements given the sheer number of wheels on the half-track.&nbsp; The treehouse also sports a reasonable amount of greenery and provides useful arch pieces for any MOC tree in your city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many City sets, this one features white-printed short-lifespan stickers.&nbsp; This set in particular depends on stickers to give texture to the treehouse roof and wooden boards.&nbsp; When these stickers have cracked and peeled after 2 years or so, the set will look noticeably worse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And&nbsp;why, oh why, are Lego&#39;s best Swamp Police sets exclusives? This set and 60070 Water Plane Chase would have to be the pick of the Swamp Police lineup, yet they have the most limited availability.&nbsp; Just another TLG Marketing mystery to ponder I suppose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is well worth the money and features hours of playability for kids.&nbsp; For AFOLs, the half-track alone makes it worthy of serious consideration.&nbsp; Go forth and get thee one.&nbsp;</p>
