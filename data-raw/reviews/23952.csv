<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard selection of parts, but some really nice&nbsp;parts including the white 2x2x2/3 curved slopes and the string.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m satisfied with the set. It is small, but really nice value for the parts and the string. The builds are perfectly fine and they basically&nbsp;are what they need to be. Each part serves its purpose that children can easily make a custom situation with.&nbsp;</p>

"Brickking6077","2020-05-04T02:51:02.273Z","A Fire Starter Set? Is it safe for kids?","<p>Fire has always been at the forefront of City alongside Police. However, fire chiefs are often only included in larger sets. Furthermore, few sets have both a male and female firefighter working together to extinguish the blaze. This self-named &quot;starter set&quot; might just start a fire of passion for purchasing more City sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The fire chief is justly dressed in his spiffy attire. The clean, black pants that contrast the well detailed torso are a perfect combination. Likewise, the gold chrome helmet accentuates the entire figure. His kind, but determined face is also quite lovely.</p>

<p>Both of the fire fighters in this set are equipped with the standard apparel. Although identical with each other and with other fire fighters from the same wave, they look radiant from top to bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final figure fails to fascinate. His legs are overused. A new torso would have been appropriate as well. Even the head is considerably frequent. The updated cap is the only redeeming feature of this figure.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>The fire ATV is admirably designed. Riding on heavy-duty tires and using two handlebar elements, the resultant model stands resolute. There is also a notable amount of color between the Bright Red, Trans-Dark Blue, and Trans-Yellow pieces.Room for two of the several accessories can also be found at the rear of the quad.</p>

<p>The gas pump is pleasantly accurate. Both a keypad and gauge are included on the mostly white build. A rope attached to a nozzle element reasonably captures the essence of a filling booth. To the left is a realistic addition of a bin. However, the escalating problem to the right is clearly seen as multiple flames shoot up from a pipe box. The size of this blaze could be larger, but seems befitting. A barricade is also included and can be useful for any City layout.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Considering all the facets, I believe this sets is worthy&nbsp;of acquiring if you do not have any larger fire sets or are looking to increase your battalion. Not exactly a minifigure pack, nor a substantial structure, this set still grasps the desired audience.&nbsp;AFOL or KFOL, I have no doubt that this set can appeal to all.</p>
