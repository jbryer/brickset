"zipsforbananas","2015-03-05T18:07:25.59Z","A quite charming little pocket money set","<p>I&#39;ve recently got back into the Pirates theme and bought most of the sets I used to own and always wanted but never had! The very first pirate wave is what I know and love, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not alone in thinking that with each successive wave the quality decreased:&nbsp;more varied minifigures ended up looking untidy, sturdiness went when the old castle wall pieces were phased out, the new masts have nothing on the originals, where are the chrome gold coins for shiny treasure,&nbsp;etc...</p>

<p>This set caught my eye as quite charming, a cute but effective shipwreck, and without too much of all the things that in my old and grumpy opinion (I&#39;m only in my 30s! What&#39;s happening to me?) spoilt the theme.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It comes in a simple box, maybe a bit bigger than it needs to be, but attractively designed. Only having two bags to tear open was nice for a set with less than 100 pieces.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear, but there were barely any pages where you had more than 5 pieces to put on across the double page. I know the original pirate sets were overly complicated, masses of new bricks on each page and no call out box to tell you which ones to get, and I know these sets are meant to young and inexperienced builders, but I can&#39;t help feeling that double the pace would still be a doddle to just about&nbsp;any child. It&#39;s a shame that building something so small feels so laborious because every page turn feels like it could have been one step.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some great parts amongst the 59, some 1x2 curves in dark brown and the curves you can clearly see on the wrecked ship&#39;s hull. The crow&#39;s nest is great to get, and lots of the little details are very much appreciated, the fire and the fish, the bottle, and the gun and oar that are part of the boat.</p>

<p>The new cannon is really good too, packing more of a punch than the vintage ones. And the new mould for the oar looks good too, strengthening them where they used to bend all too easily.<br />
(I&#39;ve not been following anything since about 2003, sorry if those details were in the 2009 range and are old news!)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two you get are nice enough. I&#39;m not a fan of the rag-tag look of the pirates, being too used to a very uniform captain, guy in blue, and otherwise hooped&nbsp;shirt setup. But the bare arms and chest muscles are nice, and I remember always wanting a figure like this when I was playing.</p>

<p>And the officer is a nice call out to the original style. I&#39;d have preferred his shoulder piece to be red, but otherwise it&#39;s a very nice update, especially the printing on the front of the hat.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I mentioned, I found the pace annoyingly slow, but otherwise it&#39;s a good build. The SNOT&nbsp;pieces that hold the hull pieces and the way the crow&#39;s nest attach will give good ideas to younger builders. The shape of the ship is captured really well with just a few bricks, and I like the feel of the sections of rock too.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What you end up with is everything you hoped for from the pictures, it&#39;s sizeable enough and really does look just like a broken up old wreck. The play feature where the hull side rocks back is neat, though attempts at&nbsp;hitting it with the cannon might loose you a few cannon balls.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this little set, as tiny as it is. It fits beautifully as a piece in an old school diorama, and at &pound;9 it&#39;s a great and rewarding set that kids can save up for any buy themselves. If you&#39;re into pirates, you can&#39;t go wrong getting it, and even if you&#39;re fussy like me and despair of how the theme was ruined I reckon you should still get it... and a decent number of the vintage sets... and a big blue rug!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, I didn&#39;t notice this until I looked at the box again - there&#39;s a clip you put on early in the build (that I&#39;d completely forgotten about&nbsp;by the end)&nbsp;that lets you clip it onto 70411, Treasure Island. I&#39;ve not got them both, but from the look of it they match perfectly and would look really good together!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The simplicity of the box design is refreshing.&nbsp; Other than that, nothing of note.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is where the set shines, particularly regarding the weapons.&nbsp; There are only two minifigs but the set includes 3 cutlasses, 3 flintlock pistols, and 2 muskets.&nbsp; That was quite the pleasant surprise, and I&#39;m assuming that the inclusion of so many extras was intentional, not a factory fluke.&nbsp; Unlike other sets in this wave, the cannon here comes with the old-school wheels.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Not quite a Star Wars battle pack, but the two minifigs here are certainly worthwhile.&nbsp; It&#39;s always nice to have another blue coat, and the printing on both torso and hat are great.&nbsp; The pirate&#39;s brown vest is a good variation from the striped tank-top many of his companions sport in other sets.&nbsp; He has a tiny anchor tattoo halfway covered by the vest.&nbsp; That torso should be extremely versatile for MOCs.&nbsp; The tan pants are also a welcome element.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple, with a couple interesting design choices.&nbsp; My main complaint is the pole supporting the crow&#39;s nest.&nbsp; It looks flimsy, and it <em>is</em>.&nbsp; I would have extended the brick-built rocks a bit higher and mounted the crow&#39;s nest on <em>that</em> with a little ladder.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks decent, and it&#39;s a creative design for such a small set.&nbsp; Aside from the pull-action cannon though, there aren&#39;t any notable play features, and it&#39;s not very sturdy.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set itself is nothing special, but the parts were worth it for me.</p>

"DrOrrery","2015-04-14T12:46:56.097Z","From little things, big things grow","<p>This is the smallest and simplest of the pirate lines, but manages to hold its own quite well.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A printed pirate flag, a fish and quite a few spare weapons are notable. &nbsp;Also&nbsp;the cannon with gun carriage wheels, the only instance of a wheeled cannon&nbsp;in all of&nbsp;this year&#39;s pirate sets (disappointingly).</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>A soldier with epaulettes and backpack, and a pirate with a very interesting printed torso, make additions to any pirate/soldier army.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Fairly simple and straight forward&nbsp;but fun. &nbsp;Lots of rocks at angles&nbsp;and a little bit of sideways work, but nothing at all difficult.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>For such a simple model&nbsp;it conveys the idea of the shipwreck very well. &nbsp;The side ribs of the ship, the crows nest with broken mast, and even the bowsprit made out of a rifle. &nbsp;The barrel hides some pirate treasure&nbsp;with the fish and the fire as a lid. &nbsp;One of the nicest touches is that the side of the wreck tilts, making it a great target for the cannon, tipping the pirate off after a direct hit. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>As Part of the Pirate Line</strong></p>

<p>This is common to all of my pirate set 2015 reviews. &nbsp;Lego has made the 4 smaller sets 70409, 10, 11 and 12 as parts of a greater whole. &nbsp;This set pairs with 70911, Treasure Island, attaching via a single claw part, such that the pirate wreck sits on the end of the boardwalk. &nbsp;Sets 70410 and 12 pair up similarly. &nbsp;Out of the two pairings, I think this one has more character.</p>

<p>Taken together, all 4 sets are around the equivalent of a King&#39;s Castle set. &nbsp;Slightly cheaper, with&nbsp;two thirds the number of pieces but double the minifigs and&nbsp;more&nbsp;variety. &nbsp;And, I would argue, more playability. &nbsp;Although it&#39;s true that with all Lego, more sets = more playability, this is the first instance I&#39;m aware of where the sets are very specifically designed to be combined (outside simple extensions, like the Helm&#39;s deep castle wall). &nbsp;As a whole, these 4 sets have a huge amount of enhanced playability when put together, forming little islands around which the many boats and creatures can move, or two long opposing structures facing off against each other. &nbsp;It&#39;s a great idea for the pirate line and it comes off very well.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>For such a small set this is very well done. &nbsp;The wreck has been pulled off beautifully for so few parts and the overall set has decent playability for something so small.</p>

<p>As good as this set is by itself, when you add it to the others it&#39;s even better. &nbsp;If you plan to get this set and 70911, I would add half a star, and if you plan to get all four sets, I would put this up to 5 stars. &nbsp;If you&#39;re looking at just two of the sets, I would get this one and 70911 together, they have a bit more fun and flavour.</p>
