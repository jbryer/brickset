"Harmonious_Building","2015-04-01T01:54:51.053Z","A fort for your pennies.","<p>I don&#39;t know specific or general my own LEGO history is, but here&#39;s the ultra brief run-down: I was lucky enough to have some Pirates sets as a child - none of the big ships, but I did have the coveted Imperial Trading Post (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6277-1/Imperial-Trading-Post"">6277</a>), which is I think is one of the greatest sets ever made, but let&#39;s not digress. I completely and utterly missed the 2009 Pirates reboot (popularly known as &quot;Pirates II&quot;), though I did mange to catch the tail end of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Pirates-of-the-Caribbean"">Pirates of the Caribbean</a> sets (which I hear are having another go-around too and will therefore displace these guys...sigh).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Which brings us to the 2015 Pirates, which I supposed will henceforth be known as &quot;Pirates III&quot;, if only for the sake of historical continuity. I think it&#39;s clear to me that there are two primary aims here: (a) capitalise on the nostalgia of AFOLs (like me), and (b) to hopefully introduce fresh blood to classic themes that will later be rebooted as Pirates IX in another sixteen years. This is pure conjecture on my part, of course, which I justify to pointing to the simplicity of this build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Soldiers&#39; Fort is the spiritual successor to various other Imperial strongholds that have existed over the years, though I find the resemblance and associated flavour&nbsp;is closest to 1995&#39;s Imperial Outpost (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6263-1/Imperial-Outpost"">6263</a>) and 1989&#39;s Sabre Island (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6265-1/Sabre-Island"">6265</a>), which shockingly I actually owned, which means I&#39;m probably ready for a rest home or something. It&#39;s hard to believe that the entire structure is built on just 200+ pieces, though as you might suspect, there are a number of large &quot;structural&quot;-type pieces that sacrifice detail in favour of simplicity - see point (b) above. Unfortunately, the presence of these pieces makes this set a bit dubious as far as being a parts pack goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that the fort lacks aesthetic sensibility, though, and probably the most attractive feature here is the use of the angled piece to create a dock that sticks out at a 120-degree-ish angle. The palm tree also goes a long way in both adding colour as well as an organic feel that takes away from the otherwise very right-angle-heavy build. For experienced builders who have become used to detailed builds that even City provides nowadays, the fort may seem too simple and far too cramped, but I highly doubt kids will care - they&#39;ll be far too busy getting pieces lost when they fire the cannon at the cat. Weirdly enough, the set comes with two of the new &quot;stud shooters&quot; that I&#39;ve thus far only encountered in sci-fi heavy sets like Star Wars, Ultra Agents, and Super Heroes - guess the soldiers have gotten their hands on advanced technology, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And speaking of soldiers, you get some nice minifigs here - five, which is fairly generous for a set of this size, and doubtlessly to cover the relatively low piececount. The Imperial side is definitely the winner here, and all three of the minifigs are fantastically detailed and more than worthy homages to the soldiers of yesteryear. The admiral and (possibly) his daughter are particularly noteworthy - the former because he has a great printed hat and the latter because she has great printed legs (that sounds way lewder than it should). I was disappointed at first to see that the admiral in the picture here doesn&#39;t have epaulettes, but it turns out that the image is mistaken: you get not one pair of pearl gold epaulettes but also a spare, which is a godsend if you bought the chess set (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40158-1/Pirates-Chess-Set"">40158</a>) like I did as an army builder (and yes, you do get a spare white one too - double bonus).</p>

<p>The pirates definitely fare a lot worse here. The green pirate is pretty cool, but since I have loads of the red-and-black one from the aforementioned chess set, the second pirate is beyond generic to me - of course, if this is your (or your child&#39;s) first set in the line, another actor for the scene will not be remiss. As far as equipment for the pirates, though, all they get is the little wooden boat and a high-tech shooter of their own to even the scales, I guess. The little Jolly Roger flag is a nice nostalgia rush. And, naturally, all parties involved get a host of blood-letting weapons for your enjoyment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is definitely a great piece for the kids that&#39;s not too expensive - plenty to do with an easy-to-construct backdrop that&#39;s ripe for conflict and adventure. AFOLs will probably not find this set terribly interesting - save for the nostalgia factor, of course - and I&#39;m personally hoping to use it as a &quot;seed&quot; build and try and expand it and make it look a bit beefier and more realistic - or at least try and ape Imperial Trading Post a little. An above-average set overall, recommended mostly for those who are either looking to get into Pirates or LEGO as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

"DrOrrery","2015-04-14T14:13:27.78Z","A Fort in search of More Pirates","<p>As the Largest of the Pirate Sets apart from the Brick Bounty, this is a solid set that feels like it needs more opposition.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The biggest standout here is the large printed Soldier flag&nbsp;which makes quite an impression, as well as a smaller printed pirate flag. The set also includes a pair of frogs,&nbsp;the palm tree pieces, a cannon and two stud-flicking guns,&nbsp;but in general the&nbsp;pieces are fairly standard. &nbsp;Lego has been pretty generous with the spare weapons as well, which is handy for equipping your armies of pirates and soldiers, and for some reason a pick axe has also been included here.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The two pirates and one of the solders are fairly standard. &nbsp;There is also an admiral, fairly similar to previous years but I believe with a newly printed hat and torso. &nbsp;Finally there&#39;s the female admiral (no real rank here, but I think it sounds more interesting than admirals daughter). &nbsp;This figure has a light blue and gold coat&nbsp;printed on the torso that is also printed on the legs. &nbsp;It&#39;s a very nice looking figure, and it&#39;s good to see another woman in the pirates line who actually gets a sword.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build is fairly standard, with no real deviation from most castle style forts other than the palm tree and the crane.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The model is solid and looks good, but there&#39;s nothing particularly new here. &nbsp;The prison has a removable wall for escapes as many of the town or previous castle models have. &nbsp;The crane is very manoeuvrable&nbsp;despite being very simple. &nbsp;It&#39;s a good model that does the job without being particularly interesting.<span class=""rangySelectionBoundary"" id=""selectionBoundary_1429015931786_9047059868462384"" style=""line-height: 0; display: none;"">?</span></p>

<p><strong>As Part of the Pirate Line</strong></p>

<p>This is common to all of my pirate set 2015 reviews. &nbsp;Lego has made the 4 smaller sets 70409, 10, 11 and 12 as parts of a greater whole. &nbsp;This set pairs with 70910, Soldiers outpost,&nbsp;attaching via a single claw part, such that the smaller outpost&nbsp;sits on the end of the jetty. &nbsp;Sets 70490 and 11 pair up similarly. &nbsp;Out of the two pairings, I think the pirate sets have&nbsp;more character.</p>

<p>Taken together, all 4 sets are around the equivalent of a King&#39;s Castle set. &nbsp;Slightly cheaper, with two thirds the number of pieces but double the minifigs and more variety. &nbsp;And, I would argue, more playability. &nbsp;Although it&#39;s true that with all Lego, more sets = more playability, this is the first instance I&#39;m aware of where the sets are very specifically designed to be combined (outside simple extensions, like the Helm&#39;s deep castle wall). &nbsp;As a whole, these 4 sets have a huge amount of enhanced playability when put together, forming little islands around which the many boats and creatures can move, or two long opposing structures facing off against each other. &nbsp;It&#39;s a great idea for the pirate line and it comes off very well.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is a solid, good looking set, but it feels like it needs other sets to really shine. &nbsp;All the Pirate sets seem to have been designed as part of a whole, and this one definitely feels like it needs the others. &nbsp;Adding the Soldiers outpost on the end gives this much more weight and structure. &nbsp;Putting this with the other pirate sets gives it some more interesting opposition. &nbsp;Alternatively, if you had the Brick Bounty this would feel like something it could go up against.</p>

<p>It is difficult to recommend this set by itself when 70911, Treasure Island, is both cheaper and more fun. &nbsp;If you were collecting the pirate line, this would probably be the last one to&nbsp;pick up. &nbsp;However, if you have one or two&nbsp;of the other sets, or Brick Bounty, this is a solid fort to go up against and worth another star. &nbsp;</p>

"gusmoore","2016-02-01T02:16:52.323Z","A fun little set full of nostalgia","<h3>Don&#39;t know why these sets are not so counted for from the 2015 offer, they are absolutely great!</h3>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Love the art of the box, however, here&#39;s maybe one of the reasons why this theme was not exploded at its fullest: there are no references whatsoever in the box about the addition system that was developed for this Pirates. Only at the end of the instructions you can see how a full little fortress can be assembled.</p>

<p>Also instructions were a little dull...only one brick by step is kind of annoying/boring. Also there&#39;s a printing mistake about the technic pieces, they come in blue and they are printed dark grey.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are lots of new building parts, that all together may make the set a little bit juniorized. However, these parts are great fixes from other big ones, so you can forget this kind of issue. Nice textured red bricks, the palm itself is gorgeous, along with its green leaves, also I didn&#39;t expect that the brown-white mix would look so vintage! Loved that wheel piece for the levering-chest system!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Awesome!! Face expressions and body printings are far better than those from the last time we saw Pirates! Loving the comodoro girl, and the admiral&#39;s hat printing is really gorgeous. The pirates minifigs are really cool! Krabs and frogs are always welcome!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I stated before, there are lots of surprises, specially the little bridge with its palm and connection system to the main building, and the upper part of the main building...the lever that pulls up the chest is imo well placed so you don&#39;t see the system and it manages to camouflage itself with the rest of the building, so no &quot;modern&quot; details are exposed, and the combo made of bricks and half-juniorized pieces complete all the design which I find really great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I know there may be lots of AFOLs who really dislike this new attempt to the Pirates theme, however I find these sets a very nice form of mending both Classic System and the new themes released for this scale (by now, we all have already seen Nexo Knights and the new things Lego are trying to aid to nowadays&#39; kids). It may be not that glorious as the 80&#39;s-90&#39;s ones but surely these are doing their best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set looks fantastic once assembled, and if you add 70410 Soldiers Outpost, you can have a little scenery which not only plays with nostalgia but also makes a bridge between historic background and the new generations that are now playing Lego.</p>

<p>I have to admit that I feel kind of sad to get my hands over these sets only because they were half-priced (and in Mexico that&#39;s A LOT!) specially when I see all the potential and effort that took to designers develop this theme. Hopefully in the future this can be fixed trough marketing and merchandising work, far better price tags (at least here in Mexico, these sets used to cost the same as Licensed ones) however maybe kids really need Nexo Knights and the Ninja Go Pirates thing (both of which I find clearly groundbreaking).</p>
