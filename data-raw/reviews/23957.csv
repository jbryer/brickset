"Apg1808","2015-03-02T12:19:07.273Z","The best Protector of the series","<p>I recently bought the Protector of Jungle. It was my first BIONICLE 2015 set, and I really enjoyed it!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The new BIONICLE boxes are pretty cool, the picture on the front is great, and the back shows us all we need to know about the Protector. On top of that, the box can be folded to make it easier to store.</p>

<p>The instructions are easily understandable.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With his 70 parts, the Protector of Jungle is one of the biggest Protectors. We have a lot of new parts, like the bow/lightning piece or the armour piece. We also get 2 masks in 1 set, the classic Protector mask in green colour, with translucent green at the top, and the Skull Spider mask, in Dark Blue. These masks are pretty cool and really impressive.</p>

<h3>Building experience</h3>

<p>Due to his little number of parts (70, compared to the Masters who are bigger), building the set is pretty fast. Everything is simple cause there are no complex mechanism to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is just awesome! All the pieces are useful to the Protector and the colour scheme is very nice: the green, translucent green, silver and yellowish orange are great colours and blend very well together. The weapon is perfect for this BIONICLE and its playability, plus the possibility to put the Spider on the Protector&#39;s face, give us, in my opinion, the greatest set of this first BIONICLE 2015 wave.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I really like the new hexagonal design for the box shape. The artwork is cool too. And, of course, the same artwork is displayed on the instruction manual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As for the parts included, we get some fantastic re-colors in the Keet-orange color: A hue of orange found in the Titan Bionicle set, Keetongu, from 2005. We also get a new Skull Spider mask with redesigned legs in&nbsp;Metru-Blue, the new armor cover piece in silver, the Protector mask in Green/Trans Green, trans-green armor shells, and the new Gattling Gun piece!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite fun for a small set. Hero Factory never really gave us these smaller sets, but with more pieces, it was a&nbsp;bit interesting.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>1. Overall look- The overall look of this set is fantastic! He looks ready for action! The only problem is the part of the color scheme. For what it is, it does pull of the jungle colors. But there&#39;s many different shades of green. (Lime green, Trans green, Dark green). And there&#39;s a bit of trans-bue in the Elemental Energy coming from his bow.</p>

<p>2. Articulation- This set has more articulation than usual. The open ball joints in the arms and legs allow for more posability, which is great. When you have the bow on, it does hinder the arms a little bit, but that&#39;s nutural. You can get some sick poses out of him though!</p>

<p>3. Functions- There&#39;s a new mask popping function. You can press the eye-stalk down and the mask will pop off, leaving you to put the Skull Spider on his face! Although this is cool, this makes the mask pop off unintentionally more frequently. The gun piece at the end of the bow shoots 6 1 by 1 studs. You turn the gear, and a little knob goes around and hits the pegs off. This is really cool, but the pegs are insanely easy to lose. Luckily, LEGO gives you 6-8 extra.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Cool new parts and re-colors</p>

<p>-Jungle-like colors</p>

<p>-Pretty decent articulation</p>

<p>-Awesome functions</p>

<p>-Skull Spider included (in blue)</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Some colors clash</p>

<p>-Mask will come off too easily</p>

<p>-Studs can get lost easily</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 9/10</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with a variety of interesting parts, most notable the pieces that make up the bow in blue, trans apple green, and trans-neon green, as well as all the wonderful keetorange bones, and trans apple green shells!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for this one was the usual build seen with most of the other protectors. Not too complex, but still pretty fun to put it together. 3.5/5</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>So I&#39;ll begin with this fellow the same way I began with his previous comrades. I will start with his mask, which as I&#39;ve mentioned before, is one of my favourite of the new wave of Bionicle. Another generic protector mask, except this time with a melded trans green colour. It looks absolutely amazing in the light. 5/5</p>

<p>His legs are just as good as the legs found on the Protector of Stone. They are very good for posing, the armour is placed fairly nicely so that the shells don&#39;t get in the way of the legs being moved forward. I do like the addition of the little green spines, even if they do look a little off. 5/5</p>

<p>His arms have those wonderful trans-apple shells and are very good for posing which ever way you&#39;d want to pose them. I see no reason not to give them a perfect score. 5/5</p>

<p>His torso is probably the best of the protectors. He is covered up on both his front and back with beautiful keetorange shells, which also give him some bulk. There&#39;s really nothing to complain about with this torso. 5/5</p>

<p>His weapon is arguably the best of the protectors thus far. I really enjoyed playing around with the Protector of Stone&#39;s sand staff, but this bow can be posed in so many different ways. It&#39;s extremely fun and it&#39;s a weapon that I&#39;ve been waiting for a long time to be introduced into Bionicle. It has not disappointed! 5/5</p>

<p>This is, along with the Protectors of Stone and Earth, the most playable of the protectors. He can be posed almost in any way possible, has a stud shooter bow, does not have his movement restricted by anything, and glows beautifully in the sun. 5/5</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is my favourite of the Protectors, I think he&#39;s extremely worth getting for the low price as well as for everything I&#39;ve mentioned above. Get him while he&#39;s still around!</p>

<p>Overall: 33.5/35</p>
