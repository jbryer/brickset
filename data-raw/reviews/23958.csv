<p>I got this set for my birthday about a week ago as an impulse Bionicle thing, wanting to find out if I liked the whole Gen2 vibe. I was very impressed by the value for just $10.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
An assortment of small CCBS parts, a new head, eyestalk, and piston add-on, two masks, a rapid-fire shooter, and a fair bit of Technic. That&#39;s a very promising start. Also, those trans-neon-green bones... YAY!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
None to speak of. Bionicle hasn&#39;t moved to playsets quite yet.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong><br />
Very fast. I did it in about four minutes. More or less what you&#39;d expect for a tiny set of this nature.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong><br />
AWESOME. It has actual play features, a weapon that looks suspiciously like a pepper grinder, a Skull Scorpion, and it&#39;s very poseable. I&#39;m calling him Hewkii after the Stone Matoran from 2001. The mask pops off and can be replaced with the Skull Scorpion and the pepper grinder works like a charm.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, he has more pieces than Pohatu...</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
Very sweet little set. For all the reasons mentioned above and the combination feature with Pohatu (which I have no interest in buying, but still, it&#39;s there), Hewkii is well worth the $10.</p>

<p>Also, a word of warning to those purchasing Protector of Fire: He doesn&#39;t have any elbows. Just sayin&#39;.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The new box shape, which is hexagonal, is really cool! The artwork is fantastic! (The same artwork is displayed on instructions)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Brown is back! Er...well, more of burnt-orange but it still brings in a brown hue to it! Which is nice because brown has been mostly absent in constraction since 2006! This set comes with cool re-colors in brown like armor shells...yeah that&#39;s it. It also comes with the Energy pieces in trans-neon green and clear (at the tip). The set&#39;s new pieces are the new armor covers in silver, the Protector mask in Brown/Trans-Neon Green, the Skull Spider mask and redesigned claws.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite similar to Protector of Jungle, so which ever one you get first, the build is mostly similar. It was still enjoyable, especially the weapon.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>1. Overall Look- The overall look is great! The Trans-Neon Green works very well with the Brown/Burnt-Orange color. Little accents of silver work with it. Some poses with the weapon look awkward though. And the weapon almost seems too large.</p>

<p>2. Articulation- The set offers lots of main articulation. The arms and legs are very&nbsp;articulated.&nbsp;When&nbsp;the weapon is being held, it drastically limits the articulation in the arms.</p>

<p>3. Functions- You can pop off the mask by pressing the eye-stalk down. Then you can put the Skull Spider on him to take control! The mask will fall of easier though.&nbsp;The gun piece can be turned by a gear to shoot out pegs, but pegs can get lost easily. Luckily, LEGO gives you 6-8 extra</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- New colors</p>

<p>-Cool new parts!</p>

<p>-Colors bring out a Stone vibe</p>

<p>-Functions are really cool!</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Limited articulation to arms when weapon is held</p>

<p>- Mask can fall off easily</p>

<p>- Pegs can get lost easily</p>

<p>- Build is similar to PoJ (or vice versa)</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 8/10</strong></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is super quick, it&#39;s a little bit different from the Toa, but I wouldn&#39;t focus too much on that portion of the set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is actually fantastic and looks excellent next to Pohatu. I love the use of more burnt orange shells, the beautiful mask mixed with translucent neon green, all the translucent neon green parts. I even love the little bit of asymmetry in the little guy&#39;s design. His weapon is also very well designed and, you guessed it, MORE trans neon green pieces. I honestly love this colour scheme for the stone characters, it reminds me a lot of the Rock Raiders theme from LEGO for their whacky colours back then. I don&#39;t mind the blue eye stock pieces at all, in fact, I like that they differentiate this character from the Toa of Stone himself, who has green eyes. I know that the weapons for the protectors can be irritating because the tiny studs can get lost so easily, but I love the function of the weapon! I think it&#39;s extremely fun (I have already lost two studs....). A lot of people will say that a big problem with this set is the fact that his back isn&#39;t covered up at all, but as with Pohatu, I feel LEGO is aiming for a certain theme with the stone characters. They live in a desert, or wasteland setting...it makes sense for the protector, as well as Pohatu to be less covered up.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Anyway, this is solely my opinion, but this will be the only Protector I will buy, and honestly, if you love the colours on this one, like the weapon, or have a Pohatu of your own, buy it. It doesn&#39;t cost too much to buy, it&#39;s a fun little set, and it looks fantastic with his Toa counterpart.&nbsp;</p>

"JellyBeanie","2016-07-09T17:19:59.297Z","Machine Gun. Must I say more?","<p>Hey hey hey! I, <strong>Wolffe33</strong>, am here again! this time reviewing the <strong>Protector of Stone</strong>. Read on!</p>

<p>Love the parts. he has four Dark Orange shells and a mask of the same color. the neon flame pieces look useful, but i haven&#39;t used them cuz i was to busy with (drumroll) the machine gun! or six-shooter, whichever you want to call it. it has <strong>endless</strong> uses, as i have found out! i recently ( and still am ) using/used it for a moc of Iron Skull&#39;s sub. i can&#39;t begin to imagine other ways to incorporate this piece into your models! it&#39;s <em>that awesome</em>. i had lots of fun shooting the Earth Blue Skull Spider included with the gun. as for the ammo, it&#39;s 1x1 studs as with all of those sets with the six-shooters included, this time in neon yellowish green, whatever you call it. those studs sure like to get lost. you also get two silver hands, two of those new Bionicle shells ( also in silver ), two small feet in silver and a shell the same shape as the rest in -- you guessed it -- silver. there are four dark bley short CCBS limbs, and four neon yellowish green CCBS legs a bit longer than the bley ones. the torso is made of a mini version of the average type of CCBS torso, don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called, but looks like it&#39;s in every other Protector. Oh, and the head is silver ( aren&#39;t you getting sick of silver yet? ) with a transparent blue eyestalk, my first. and finally, the Mask! it has a dark orange bottom half which sort of bleeds into neon yellowish green, and has the typical mold of all the Protectors. i like the mold, though. also, you get some white teeth/horn pieces on his feet and right shoulder. i like the Skull Spider in Earth Blue, he has some Titanium Metallic legs and a scorpion tail, which is a leg piece reused. and some Technic in the gun.</p>

<p>the build was real fast. you snap the legs on the Skull Spider, snap some joints and shells on the torso, and then you snap some Technic pieces together. real fast, like i said.</p>

<p>kids younger than myself will probably lose some bullets, but they&#39;ll have a blast. real good playability!</p>

<p>Value for Money is good also, my pops gave me five bucks to spend at the Lego Shop, and i got this guy at half price.</p>

<p>i totally recommend to anyone who wants a six-shooter piece, some Dark Orange, or something to get their kid for Christmas. Spam-Tastic!</p>
