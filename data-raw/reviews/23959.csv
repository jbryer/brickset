"Super_Mario_64","2015-03-30T20:19:02.08Z","Protecter of Water-the Matoran were better.","<p>I acquired the Protector&nbsp;of Water a few weeks ago, and I was&nbsp;<em>mildly</em>&nbsp;impressed. Not enough to make me want to go out and by another Protector though.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is alright, the ergonomic design is a good thing, but it is WAY too flimsy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are average, with the mask being the best piece included.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a rather easy model; my little brother was able to put it together perfectly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Protector of Water, as all the other Protectors are, is rather small. Some of the armour pieces look a bit off, and I&#39;ve already switched some pieces around to make it look better.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This isn&#39;t a bad set, but it isn&#39;t too good either. I wouldn&#39;t really recommend getting it, unless you want all the BIONICLE sets. I don&#39;t know why they decided to go with the Protectors instead of the Matoran. The Matoran all had unique stories and were a lot more diverse. The Protectors feel like mindless, souless robots who have no free will. I&#39;ll be interested how LEGO attempts to create a legitimate story with these guys. This new BIONICLE will never be as good as the original.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2015-10-01T21:38:13.007Z","Protector of Water","<p>My second Bionicle purchase since the start of the new reboot, the Protector of Water has a lot of good features and a few downsides. Let&#39;s&nbsp;<strong><em>dive</em></strong>&nbsp;in shall we?</p>

<p>First though, I feel it is worth noting what is this guy&#39;s place in Bionicle&#39;s story. Seeing that a large part of the appeal of Bionicle comes from the story, I think it is worth brief mention; especially seeing that the Protector&#39;s roles are not as easily noted as are the Toa or the Villains. First this Protector is named&nbsp;<em>Kivoda</em>&nbsp;something not listed on the box or the set title. Kivoda&nbsp;is also a male, breaking up the former Bionicle tradition that &quot;all good guys who are blue are female.&quot; (Apparently the Protector of Earth is a female, again showcasing the changes in the new rebooted story.) &nbsp;According to Biosector01&nbsp;Kivoda got his title from his late father.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, that is enough of the story, onto the actual set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The blue protector mask is the standout part here, and a lot of other parts come in a nice dark trans blue and light trans blue colors. The Skull Spider comes in silver, a color also available in at least 4 other Bionicle sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A simple build. This is though a lot beefier than Bionicle&#39;s previous Matoran/Agori/Turaga builds. However seeing that the model is worth $10 dollars, maybe it would be more appropriate to compare it to the classic Toa sets than the Matoran sets...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either way, the build has few surprises and is quickly finished.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This Protector looks good, the basic shells are very sleek, and the main silver shell on the torso provides a nice armored look on top of the smoother pieces. I am divided on the weapon, I like how it looks like a device to propel the Protector through the water, yet I dislike how it forces the Protector to hold it with both hands.&nbsp;The detractor of the model is the turbine propellers on the shoulders, they are just kind of ridiculous, and dwarf the Protector with their size.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a good model, but not an outstanding one. If I had the money I would buy multiples to build villagers to accompany the Toa and Protectors, but seeing that my funds are tight I don&#39;t have enough reason to justify a second purchase. If this model does anything, it is that it serves a complement to the Toa, as a source of wisdom or support. This is an average set, get it if you are&nbsp;into Bionicle and want to complete a set of with the six Protectors, or if you want parts to build villagers. The price is good, and would make a great &quot;stocking stuffer&quot; for any parent who needs a Bionicle gift for their kid this Christmas (It also makes a great impulse buy for a cash strapped college student like me). So yeah, that is The Protector of Water, he&#39;s a solid buy, but not anything to get to excited about.</p>
