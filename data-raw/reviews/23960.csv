"Speninator","2014-12-30T09:41:43.393Z","The Picture Doesn't Do Him Justice","<p>I picked this up as part of my vow to collect every single new bionicle set, and I personally didn&#39;t expect much. The picture makes him look strange, especially with the launcher built into his chest while the other protectors have it in their hands. In his picture his shoulder-pads also look like claws, and the weapon in his right hand looks like some strange spiked-ball. However, the set is much better than it seems.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this are nice, and feel sturdy, especially compared to earlier Bionicle parts. Some remarkable things about his parts are that some come in a very dark transparent purple color that I&#39;ve never seen before. Most of his parts, including the Protector mask, shoulder pads, feet, and launcher piece in the middle are new to this year. He also comes with a mini-CCBS torso, underneath all of his armor. This set also comes with black hands, and a boatload of purple studs, for when you inevitably lose them when you shoot them.</p>

<p>The armor is nothing new, except for his shoulder pads and mask. I have no idea how useful they&#39;d be in a MOC, though. The feet are particularly cool. They have three toes, like Piraka feet, but they have little bars in between. I even tried connected the skull spider&#39;s legs to them to give him talons, and it doesn&#39;t look that bad.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, this set also comes with a yellowish-green skull spider. The spider isn&#39;t anything special, its five parts, one being the mask and the other four being its aforementioned legs. They aren&#39;t the most useful, but they&#39;re still pretty cool as parts.</p>

<p>Overall, the parts are a nice selection. And this set has quite a bit too, especially for a small set. I&#39;m just thankful these small box sets aren&#39;t crappy 14-piece rip-offs anymore! But by far the coolest part of the parts (heh) is that they seem durable. Sturdy and invincible. Even the clips on the spider&#39;s legs are thicker than they would have been. Thank goodness I can take it apart and rebuild it <em>as much as I want </em>without risking the joints cracking.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quick, but nice. You first construct the torso, and the armor, and then the legs. Its interesting to see how the launcher works: it has a small yellow bit in the center, and when it rotates (via a gear on the protector&#39;s back) it pops the studs out of their spots, shooting them off. The arms and legs are fun to build with the CCBS, and they look great too. The build is fun and all, but the real fun comes from the completed model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Oh man, where to begin. I love this set, its the best so far. I&#39;ll start off with the skull spider.</p>

<p>The skull spider isn&#39;t bad, in fact it adds quite a bit of playability. After all, with no enemies (aside from the Lord of Skull Spiders) it gives the protector a purpose. And not only that, but if the skull spider can hit the protector&#39;s brain in the back of his head, it clicks off the mask and the spider can latch on instead! Then its legs can be used to grip the head, and hold on to prevent it from being knocked off by the brain as easily. Cool feature!</p>

<p>Unfortunately though, the skull spider is hard to stand up to look great since its legs often fall off. I&#39;m afraid that the clips will snap like droid arms, but thats just my paranoid side coming up... I hope. Overall, the spider is a nice addition and the set wouldn&#39;t feel complete without it.</p>

<p>Now onto the protector... oh man, its awesome. Perhaps the best part about it is just his structure. His lower body is thin and minimal, but around his upper body it becomes very thick and bulky. Some technic parts inside his chest hold different ball joints, so his arms aren&#39;t connected on the standard protector torso but some armor plates are instead. Then the rock-like shoulder pads really add some bulk.</p>

<p>This set really did good on the bulk without restricting the poseability at all. The arms and legs are fully poseable, and they&#39;re easy to pose. Even though they&#39;re positioned a bit further back, the set still has no trouble at all standing steady. The purple drill in his right hand is also quite fun to pose.</p>

<p>His left hand is kinda... meh. I&#39;ll admit, its not bad, at least they did something, but there could be something else there. I can&#39;t say what, but something else might help to fill in the gap. And I guess that&#39;s what they did, with the two spikes. The other hand on the other hand (heh again) is really outdone! Its half a spike-ball, attached to a spinnable gear that&#39;s held in the hand. If you spin the gear, the whole piece spins, and looks <em>really </em>cool, especially since its partially transparent as well.</p>

<p>The launcher is a nice addition, but I don&#39;t like it. The ammo is really small, and for this set in particular, too dark... I&#39;m afraid to shoot the studs because I know I will lose <em>every single one </em>in less than five minutes. They tried to compensate by giving you lots of extras, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that the launcher is too easy to accidentally shoot, and that the ammo is too hard to find and reload when you do accidently shoot it. At least the launcher is built into his body, and it looks cool even if it isn&#39;t loaded.</p>

<p>One more complaint I have is about the mask-popping-off feature I described earlier. You hit the brain, and off comes the mask. This is both a blessing and a curse. Its super cool when you&#39;re playing, but when you&#39;re posing or just moving it around, the mask comes off too easily. I would like it if the clips of the mask were a bit stronger so it could resist a bit of pressure, because as it is, the mask comes off pretty easily, when you want it to, and when you don&#39;t.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In the end, this set&#39;s body structure and sheer poseability makes up for its few flaws. The skull spider is a great touch, and the way the set is built really makes it seem top-heavy and powerful without unbalancing it. The weapon rocks (literally), the launcher not so much, but its cool just the same. The playability for this set is also sky-high, with the ability to launch of the mask, spin the weapon, and shoot the launcher. This set is a great buy if you&#39;ve got the money, and I&#39;ll ambitiously say that he&#39;s one of the best protectors. Well worth the $10 price tag. As I said before, the picture doesn&#39;t do this fantastic set justice! You&#39;ll just have to buy it and see for yourself what the Protector of Earth really looks like!</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2016-10-15T22:39:52.477Z","One of My Favorite Protector Sets","<p>Its strange looking back on the 2015 Bionicle sets, knowing that the line would only last for one more year before being canceled again. With that said, one of the series that surprised me the most in the new Bionicle were the Protector sets. My initial thoughts of the Protector of Water (review here:&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49267"">http://brickset.com/reviews/49267</a>) were a bit lukewarm, and oddly enough has become one of my most down-voted&nbsp;reviews here on Brickset. Despite my lukewarm impressions, I slowly began collecting the Protectors, following up with the Protector of Fire, and later the Mask Maker vs. Skull Grinder set which included Ekimu in a Protector like build. It was shortly after that I was drawn to purchase the Protector of Earth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the reasons I wanted this set was when I started learning about the stories of the Protectors. The Protector of Earth was revealed to have been named Korgot, she was the only woman among the Protectors, and represented a change in Bionicle tradition, suggesting a bit more of a diverse world than the original story. Of course this backstory&nbsp;turned out to be of little importance, as the line was canceled before any of these details could be further fleshed out.</p>

<p>This set came in the hexagonal style boxes used in Bionicle&#39;s&nbsp;2015 wave. The cardboard was more flimsy than the cardboard used in the 2016 boxes. The build was easy, without many differences between the other Protector sets. The main unique build was the methods used to integrate the chest mounted stud shooter, and mount the arms behind it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts included in this set consists of some beautiful trans-purple colored bone pieces, and CCBS shells in black. Korgot&#39;s mask is exclusive to this set, and it suits her very well with its dark earthy appearance. The head and eye stalk are common pieces to the Bionicle 2015-2016 waves, but considering how short lived the theme was they might become more valuable in the future.&nbsp;The greenish Skull Spider here is included in three other sets. Although I am not a fan of the skull spiders individually, they are fun to collect. In total, the Bionicle 2015 winter wave included 14 different sets with Skull Spiders variants, and they are quite the sight once all are gathered together. As such, they are a rather fun collectible for those who bought all the 2015 sets.</p>

<p>The weakest part of the finished model is Korgot&#39;s tools. The drill in her right hand looks small, and has a rather lackluster function. The knife in her left hand is even more ridiculous, looking very small in comparison to the figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure though is a rather strong display figure. Korgot&nbsp;is strong and bulky, yet has enough sleekness she still retains a bit of a feminine look. The bulky rock shoulder pads help to bulk out the figure, and make her look like the perfect companion to Onua. Her color scheme is well balanced, the only odd inclusion being the fact her stud shooter uses opaque purple studs instead of transparent purple studs (trans-purple studs were not introduced until 2016&#39;s Onua, although they should have been introduced with Korgot I believe.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I am satisfied with this figure, and think it is one of the better Protector sets that came out in 2015. Figures such as this make me sad that Bionicle was canceled so soon, but give me inspiration for future MOCs. Displaying Korgot with Ekimu and the other five Protectors creates an impressive diorama scene, and the seven figures together look wonderful, despite the individual flaws of some of the sets. I wholly recommend the Protector of Earth as a set.</p>
