"Speninator","2015-01-03T06:52:59.8Z","A Little Hard to Pose, But Cool Nevertheless","<p>The Protector of Ice is actually a pretty nice set. It has a killer color-scheme, consisting of white and transparent-blue. The shield, launcher, and pick are nice touches. It also comes with a silver skull spider, which gives this Protector something to protect against. Even though it looks really nice, its a pain in the butt to pose, and his arms are severely lacking.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are charming and unique. I&#39;ve never seen a trans-blue sawblade before, especially on a Bionicle! The icepick is cool too, with the marbled white to trans-blue texture. This set comes with three of the new armor plates from 2015, two on each shoulder and one on the chest. The feet are unique as well, with three toes and two bars in between them. It also has an adorable protector torso, which may seem cramped at first but actually lets you make smaller figures. Speaking of which, this figure may be small, but it still has a lot of parts!</p>

<p>It also comes with the new head, eyestalk and protector mask. Like the pick, the mask is marbled between the two colors. The eyestalk for this protector is trans-blue, like the rest of his armor, so it matches his color scheme very well. The set also has the silver skull spider, which can serve as a mask, or as a spider once you connect the four legs.</p>

<p>Other than that, the set has generic CCBS bones and trans-blue CCBS plates that hold together the armor. I&#39;m not sure of the MOC value of the set, but it isn&#39;t extremely high.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Its a standard build. The bones connect to the torso, the plates to the bones, and the armor to the plates. The legs are the same, and the arms and mirrored versions of each other. Not a bad build, and pretty simple too. What I like about the build is that you put the mask on last, just like the traditional Bionicles. That was always my favorite part.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The parts are great and unique, and the build isn&#39;t fantastic but its still good. The completed model isn&#39;t too bad either. One major flaw present right off the bat is that the arms only have one bone, and then the hand! Not only does this shorten the arms, it also restricts the rotation of the hand on one axis. This flaw is even visible in the set picture. Another problem I have is that the shield is positioned too far from his hand. Granted, both of these can be fixed relatively easily, and it makes the set much better as a whole.</p>

<p>The legs are also kinda strange. The upper leg parts connect directly to the lower leg piece, without restrictions on the side, meaning the legs can get disoriented during play. Its as if the designers switched the leg and arm bones, thinking restricting the hands was right while not restricting the ankles. This problem isn&#39;t as bad, though.</p>

<p>The set comes with a skull spider, also. Since it functions as a mask, you can pop off the protector mask (by tapping the eyestalk) and you can pop on the skull spider, like a krana. Two of the legs can wrap around the head, while the other two dangle awkwardly in front of the torso. Its a cool feature, and makes it more fun to play with. It does more harm than good, though. Hitting the eyes to knock off the mask is cool and all, but after you accidentally do it a good five or six times it becomes a hassle and a pain, and I&#39;d much rather just pry off the mask myself than hit the eyes. The mask is also very loose, meaning it doesn&#39;t take much pressure to take it off. If you drop this set, I&#39;ll bet you money that mask is coming off.</p>

<p>In one hand this protector holds a sawblade that acts a a shield, just like Kopaka did. Turn the gear on the back, and the shield spins. Its a quaint little feature, but not entirely necessary. The yellow on the spinning bar also skews the color scheme a little, but its easy to look past, or hide if you&#39;re posing the set.</p>

<p>His other hand holds the stud launcher, and an icepick. One thing I immediately hated about this is that the launcher shoots tiny studs, and fast, too. I&#39;m afraid to fire the dang thing in fear I&#39;ll lose all of them right away, like a freaking rhotuka. Even though they give you a bazillion extra studs, that doesn&#39;t stop me from trying not to lose the ones in the launcher. What I do is I just took the studs out, to stop the risk of accidentally firing them by hitting the gear.The yellow also messes up the scheme, and it would look much better with blue. My gripe with this weapon is that it rotates on his hand. It can make for some cool poses, but also some stupid ones where it faces completely backwards.</p>

<p>Enough complaining from my side. In the end, the final product is quite nice actually. The icepick and shield go very well together, and the colors are visually appealing. I also really like the bulk armor, especially around his torso and neck, that resembles a big, fluffy coat and makes it look as if the protector is trying to keep warm in the snow. The legs are also nice, with the feet really matching the rest of the body. Even though he doesn&#39;t have a uniquely built torso area like the Protector of Earth, he&#39;s still built nicely, fun to look at, and also fun to play with. Except when the mask comes off and you have to drop everything to get it back on. I bet in 10 years there&#39;ll be tons of these on ebay and places missing the masks and ammo, because all of them come off super easy and are easier to lose.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have a lot of gripes about this set, but in the end it&#39;s a decent set. I really do like the colors and the build, and it goes well together. Just like how the protector of earth resembles a powerful rock, this one resembles a huddling eskimo with all of this extra armor around his head. The feet, weapons, mask, skull spider, armor, and launcher all work together to make this set complete. It&#39;s a nice buy, but I don&#39;t know if its worth $10. I&#39;d probably buy it for $7, but $10 isn&#39;t bad, especially if you want to collect all the sets like I do.</p>

"Renzari","2015-02-19T03:30:29.993Z","The Matoran are back!","<p>This is my second Bionicle set and I LOVE IT! Now to the review...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Some people complain that when they get their Bionicle sets the boxes are messed up. I haven&#39;t had a problem with that yet, but the boxes can and will crease and bend easily. The art on the box is very Bionicle-like. The instructions are kinda standard except the mini-comic in the front! (Same as on the box)</p>

<h3>Parts (71)</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7368/16389700229_887ce94d81_m_d.jpg"" />This picture is missing one part. It fell when I took the photo.</p>

<p>There are 71&nbsp;parts included (68 with 3 extra). This set&#39;s part colors include Black, Dk. Stone Grey, Lt. Stone Grey, Silver, Trans. Lt. Blue, White, Blue, Bright Yellow, and Red. New parts include Mask of Ice (Protector Ver.), White armor add-ons, The rapid shooter (2 parts), and a size 1 pin cover. By the way, I love the Protector masks!</p>

<h3>Minifigures (0)</h3>

<p>No Minifigures to record unless the Skull Spider counts. :P</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very solid for a CCBS&nbsp;build. Even though he/she doesn&#39;t&nbsp;have elbows, the sizes make sense. I give this build a 9.3/10!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8632/16390071307_f89c82c0f7_m_d.jpg"" style=""width: 240px; height: 180px;"" />Bags :P</p>

<p>The completed model... Hmm. I like it! It is hard to pose most poses with the weapons in-hand, but you can get a lot of good poses out of him/her! Time to battle, Skull Spider!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Pose-ability: 9/10</p>

<p>Build: 9/10</p>

<p>Parts: 9/10&nbsp;</p>

<p>Colors: 8/10 Why? The red pins. And the Dk. Stone Grey arms. It would&#39;ve&nbsp;been better in black.</p>

<p>Overall: 9/10</p>

<p>Congrats Lego for Bionicle&#39;s return and I hope to have 9 more years with ya!</p>

<p>Thank you and Buy Ekimu!</p>

"SanMams91","2015-09-08T13:22:25.577Z","Izotor, Protector of Ice","<p>The build</p>

<p>As with almost the whole year of Bionicle, the build is very similar to the other protectors, albeit with some minor differences. As always, I love the sound of joints clicking into place and building the skeleton of the model. 3.5/5</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As with the Skull Slicer, I will go review this figure based on a couple of components that I have decided are crucial to wanting to buy the figure.</p>

<p>Firstly, there is the colour scheme. Many people have complained that the silver feet ruin the aesthetics&nbsp;of the figure by clashing with the other colours. I just don&#39;t believe that that is true in this case, as there are silver parts all over the figure that can be seen. I love the translucent blue pieces, the misty colour of his little saw shield, which is all covered up by big white armour pieces. I love the colour scheme on this one. 5/5</p>

<p>As with all the other protectors, the mask is the exact same. The only difference are the colours, and I have to say, this one looks fantastic. I&#39;ve already said that I love the protector mask in general, so this is perfect for me. 5/5</p>

<p>His arms do leave a little bit to be desired, however. Although I really don&#39;t think that they look super awful, I can understand why many people would hate that the figure doesn&#39;t have elbow joints. It makes him much more difficult to pose. However, I get what LEGO was going for with this figure. Like Kopaka, they&#39;ve tried to make thrice characters look bulky, or equipped for the harshness of their environment. Kopaka had snow shoes/ski boots, this character has a whole coat over him. I think it differentiates the character from the other protectors and I like that. If not for the awkward posing of his arms, they would be perfect for me. 4.5/5</p>

<p>His legs on the other hand are extremely well made for posing. I don&#39;t think the legs make him look oddly proportioned, mainly because all his armour&nbsp;hides his general shape. The designer positioned the armour well on the character&#39;s hips and I again love the use of translucent blue. 5/5</p>

<p>The torso, in my opinion, is one of the best parts&nbsp;of this set. All I can say is that it is well covered, fairly bulky, covers both sides (front and back), and very much looks like the figure is wearing some kind of protection against the cold. I like the torso very much! 5/5</p>

<p>The weapons are excellent on this one. I think the spinning saw shield is extremely fun to play with and I very much love the ability of the Gatling gun to fire little translucent blue studs. I like the random icicle being used as a bayonet and like the misty opaque blue colour of the shield. Not much more that I&#39;d ask for with these weapons! 5/5</p>

<p>Playability of&nbsp;this figure is limited, despite my liking him overall. The arms hinder posing....but that&#39;s about it honestly. He&#39;s otherwise extremely fun to play around with. 4.5/5</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this figure. He&#39;s not as fantastic as the Protector of Stone for me, but he&#39;s definitely up there as one of my favourites of the wave. I love the concept behind him, I love his weapons, the colours are excellent. If you&#39;re an ice fan in general, he is a must have. If you already have Kopaka, give him a little helper because they&nbsp;look awesome together. If you&#39;re debating on which of the protectors to buy first, I&#39;d say this one is not at all a bad pick up. I&#39;m excited to see more Bionicle sets next year.</p>

<p>9.4/10</p>

<p>The box is a new design and a lot of people have been complaining about it, and I agree. It crushes too easily and will be worth less on bricklink. The instructions are very normal for this brand and feature a short comic in the front.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Ok, contains many parts in new colors, mask, 1x1 technic beams, rapid fire shooter, and skull spider.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Were invisible. Very nice nonexistent printing, and all were exclusive to the set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Ok, not much to say here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Ok, no arm joints and the mask falls off way too e</p>

"timmytowntim","2016-08-23T21:57:31.687Z","Little guy packs a punch","<p>Izotor&nbsp;is the Protector of Ice on Okoto&nbsp;in BIONICLE G2 lore. Is this set cool as ice, or does it melt away? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Izotor&nbsp;is a neat little guy with some decent value. You get the Protector himself and a silver Skull Spider, who isn&#39;t anything too special, but adds some conflict in box. Izotor has a spiffy white and trans blue Protector mask that looks great on him and fits with his colour scheme, plus one of the stud six shooters and a saw piece that you can spin around from the back. He&#39;s fairly poseable, but doesn&#39;t have elbows for whatever reason. He&#39;s probably a bit better for display than for play, but definitely&nbsp;not a bad set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Colour&nbsp;scheme is pretty good</p>

<p>Stud shooter is always nice</p>

<p>Conflict in box</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Seriously, where are his elbows?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I quite like this little guy. I&#39;d recommend him so long as you aren&#39;t expecting him to be a breakthrough in playability or anything</p>
