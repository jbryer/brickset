<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a foldable, with a bag and instructions. Just perfect</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are Bionicle, which means they have some technic and then the robot parts, which I am at a loss to give names to. The robot has two masks, one is the fire mask, and the other a green mask which sort of evokes the Predator creature from the films.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was reasonably easy. I am astonished that my son, who is just 5 1/2 can build this model rather easily. He is now playing daily with Technic parts too so I guess he&#39;s not the usual 5 year old either.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Awesome, although a bit short. The body is articulated on a torso piece, it&#39;s stable, limbs move rather gracefully. The firing weapon shoots and the projectiles need to be controled otherwise they&#39;d get lost easily, the fire swords look a bit odd but they have nice colours.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not sure what and how you can build more complex or different robots with more Bionicle sets, but as individual boxes at least they look good</p>
