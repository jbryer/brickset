This is my favorite Bionicle model of the January 2015 release.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The new box style is very interesting because Lego used a different company for their boxes called &quot;G Box.&quot; The new style box is cool because of its angular edges. The instructions are the same style as any other Lego set.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>My favorite part overall is Lewa&#39;s golden mask. There are some other nice parts such as his X Glider pieces and the Skull Spider&#39;s legs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The only &quot;minifig&quot; is the blue Skull spider in this set. It is the same build as all other Skull spiders. The only difference is that this one is blue to represent that it is the jungle element for the Skull spiders. Yes, blue=jungle for spiders, green=jungle for Toa.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Unlike any of the other Bionicle sets, Lewa has a unique gear system. It was&nbsp;a very quick build. The way you put the masks on for the new Bionicles&nbsp;is completely different than any other headpiece style in old Bionicles or Hero Factory.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Like I said before, this is my favorite Bionicle in the new release. The only thing I don&#39;t like is that the ball joints show in the skeleton underneath the chest plate. I think they could have put 2 armor plates on to make it look more complete on all the new Toa&nbsp;models. There are 2 spikes on Lewa that &quot;kind of&quot; cover it, but you can still see them. I do like the way you can take his X Glider off and make 2 axes out of it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set for any new or old Bionicle fan.</p>

"Zatth","2015-01-05T22:59:53.033Z","Lewa - The Master of dual-purpose weaponry!","<p>I was lucky enough to be able to pre-order this set from Amazon, and receive it as soon as this first Bionicle wave shipped out in December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Lewa&#39;s box art immediately catches the eye. He&#39;s a pretty colorful set, and this is borne out by said box&nbsp;art. The instruction booklet is nothing terribly exceptional, unfortunately, but it&#39;s still high quality. The booklet cover features a slightly altered version of the box art.&nbsp;Also included&nbsp;is an extended version of the simple comic featured on the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Master of Jungle makes heavy use of a more modern shade of green - this is not the same green that the original Lewa&nbsp;had. This shade of green is featured in certain Superheroes ultrabuild figures, such as the Joker and The Green Lantern. It&#39;s a nice, bright shade that fits the Jungle theme well.</p>

<p>Also included are four unique pieces - CCBS armor pieces in the much loved/hated &quot;Keetorange&quot; yellow-orange color. This is a first, as previous Bionicle&nbsp;&quot;Air&quot; type sets rarely mixed this shade with green. Surprisingly, the colors contrast well and do not look terribly out of place.</p>

<p>Lewa&nbsp;doesn&#39;t feature many exclusive parts, but does have many nice ones in sought after colors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Lewa&#39;s build is a little tricky. It adds some flavor to the traditional Hero Factory build with the new<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;gearbox setup. Aside from being cool-looking, the tooth/claw pieces on the shoulders serve an interesting purpose - they actually hide the gear assembly on the finished model. Without those pieces, the gearbox setup would be a real eyesore from the front.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Lewa has quite a bit of playability. The blue skull spider is a little simplistic, and presents an all-too-easy challenge for our hero - still, the inclusion of conflict in the set is a nice touch.&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The dual-purpose weapons are a real highlight - easy to convert, they look cool in either mode. One noticeable con, unfortunately, is the lack of neck mobility. It&#39;s tough to move&nbsp;</span>Lewa&#39;s<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;head around, largely because the gearbox gets in the way. Still, the completed figure is a lot of fun and is great for posing.</span>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">I was really excited to be able to get one of the first sets of this new generation of&nbsp;</span>Bionicle<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">. You can tell that the set and story designers put a lot of work into making this theme a real treat for new and old fans alike.</span></p>

<p>The Master of Jungle is definitely worth the money - check him out!</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-06-28T17:17:53.287Z","Awesome Bionicle Set.","<p>I have no nostalgia for the old Bionicle sets, and this is my first ever. This is a totally honest review. That said, I love this set!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The new Bionicle sets come in cardboard hexagons. I am a little disappointed by this because part of what made Bionicle so cool to me was the canisters. This doesn&#39;t take away from the set, though. The front shows Lewa in action and the back shows a mini comic and some of the features of the figure.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has some cool parts. I believe the axe heads are new for 2015 Bionicle and the mask is unique to this set. The printed torso is also unique and looks cool. I like the mix of colors, because they could be useful for building mechs and other robots.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Skull Spider looks great. The articulated legs are nice. This figure has good pieces for MOCs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set is fairly easy. I&#39;ve gotten used to the CCBS. The only part I had trouble with was lining up some of the gears in the arm-swinging mechanism.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks fantastic. Lewa has a great color scheme and cool weapons. I like how he can use his axes as wings. The mask feature is cool, but you have to take off the Skull Spider&#39;s front legs to attach it. The arm swing feature is also fun.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was a bit skeptical of these sets at first, because they looked like another wave of Hero Factory, (which I loved) and took away some of Bionicle&#39;s uniqueness. My opinion has changed. Overall, this set is great. It is definitely worth your money.The sheer size makes up for the poor price to piece count, which is to be expected from CCBS sets. My only complaint really is that there isn&#39;t any conflict. That&#39;s okay, though, as I now plan to buy more of these fantastic sets!</p>

"Plural","2015-03-22T01:40:49.827Z","70784 Lewa Master of Jungle is a fantastic set. Here's why.","<p align=""CENTER""><span lang="""">Bionicle: 70784 Lewa Master of Jungle Review</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Hello and Welcome to the review of set number 70784, &quot;Lewa Master of Jungle&quot;. It is ages 7 through 14, includes 85 pieces, and was released the winter wave of the Bionicle line in 2015. So let&#39;s go onto the Skull Spider.</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Skull Spider:</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">So the Skull Spider. It is a dark Metru Blue and includes 4 points of articulation. The spider mask is a fantastic mold and works well with Lewa. It&#39;s overall an OK addition to the set, but it does not have to be here. So let&#39;s go on to the headphone bearing Toa of Air.</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Lewa:</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">So Lewa. He has a Green Lantern green, silver, and Keetorange color scheme. The green matches his personality more to me than the standard version, as it looks lighter, more active and the addition of the Keetorange clashes well with the green. When it comes to armor, Lewa is jam-packed with it. The armor is most prominent in the middle on the the upper torso, as it is not only covered with the printed chest-plate, but his two silver claw-like pieces also add to his armor. These also cover up the ball-joints that are prominent on nearly every other Toa. His armor also appears on his bottom legs, which I believe it allows the armor to be well distributed. Lewa has two main functions. He can launch off his mask and he can also move his arms with a gear system, located on his back. My biggest issue with Lewa so far is how his head can not move to far up. This is caused by his eye-stock banging in to Lewa&#39;s raised gearbox. The raised gearbox is not just there to cause an issue though. It allows Lewa to look like he is trying to blow-up his chest, similar to the classic superhero pose of the hero standing with his arms to his sides, looking into the distance. For Lewa, it wouldn&#39;t be where he would be doing it to seem empowering, but to make fun of the pose. His weaponry includes two Battle-Axes, similar to his weapon from the last generation. I do not like how his weapons are not only silver and gun-metal grey, which already do not clash well together, but the axes also include a yellow that is not the same as the prominent Keetorange which breaks the color scheme even further. This causes the weapons to be sort of ugly in my opinion. They do not only serve as weapons as they can allow Lewa to access his Adrenaline Mode, which moves the top of the axes to the lower half of his arms, moves the bottom blades on the bottom to the top of his hands, and he also gains a golden Jungle Mask. This is where he really shines as he gains the ability to fly, which fits the figure, but his rather fluid color scheme is broken due to the addition of gold. So let&#39;s go on to the mask.</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Jungle Mask:</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">So the Jungle Mask, which is its official name. In the set, we get two diffferent variants of the mask. One is the Green Lantern green and the other is in his Adrenaline Mode based gold. It strays away from all versions of the Generation One Miru, with its shorter design, scale-like face, oval shape, and his grooving headphones on the side of the mask. It really is a good mask, but I could see how a large group hates it due to how far it runs away from the original group of mask. So let&#39;s go on to my final thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Final Thoughts:</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">So my final thoughts. Lewa is a fantastic set. His only issue is with his main weapons, but that factor is demolished when you compare it to the rest of the figure and the alternate use of the weapons. I highly advise you to make the purchase. This is PluralLego and I will see you next time. Goodbye.</span></p>

"SanMams91","2015-08-08T15:20:40.607Z","Lewa is always smiling","<p>The build</p>

<p>The build for this figure is slightly more complicated than the others...but generally follows the same overall idea.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is definitely&nbsp;my second favourite&nbsp;toa of 2015. He is either slightly better or on the same level of perfection as Pohatu for me. Why? Here are a few reasons:</p>

<p>-like Pohatu, you can pose him any way you like</p>

<p>-his colour scheme attacks your eyes in a pleasant way</p>

<p>-his weapons are the best of the Toa</p>

<p>-the spikes give him an even more unique look</p>

<p>-the chest printint isn&#39;t actually as bad as some people have said that it is</p>

<p>-his light-piping is actually quite good</p>

<p>-the armour placement on him is one of the best in the wave...I wouldn&#39;t change anything about that</p>

<p>And lastly, his mask. I have read and seen many reviews of this figure where people criticize the design of Lewa&#39;s newest mask, complaining that it has no connection whatsoever to the original Miru of 2001. Firstly, I find that&nbsp;the original Miru&nbsp;was plain awkward and even ugly. Now, I&#39;ve been a fan of Bionicle for years, and Lewa happened to be one of my favourite toa as I continued to buy sets in the last decade. But I did not like that original Miru. It had way too many gaps, the beak look just didn&#39;t work too well, and the eyes were oddly slanted. I understand why the mask was designed that way, but I never liked that original Miru. This version, however, is a massive improvement, and it actually is more like the original than people care to realize. You still have the gaps on the sides of the jaw, forming Lewa&#39;s character grin, you now have narrower eyes, and an aero-dynamic pattern covering the rest of his face along with intakes which remind me of the Miru Nuva design of 2002. What I really like is the homage LEGO paid to toa/turaga Matau, as his mask is very much a key in Lewa&#39;s new design as well. For me, it works perfectly. Lewa still carries either katana or battle axes, and I&#39;m not nostalgic enough to pan this set for looking new or different. I rather adore the design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final concern I will address is that of his neck articulation. Yes, it is severely flawed, so as a toy, it may not be as fun as Kopaka or Pohatu. However, I like that the neck articulation is flawed. The reason I like it is that, if you turn Lewa&#39;s head all the way up, so that his eye stock is positioned right atop his gear box, his mask will not pop off randomly like it would on other figures. I personally very much like that I can grab him by the head and not worry about the mask falling off.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Buy this set. If not for the slight problem with neck articulation,&nbsp;Lewa&nbsp;would be my&nbsp;favourite&nbsp;of the wave.&nbsp;I think Lewa&nbsp;is better if you want to save some money, because you get a full, fun package with this one. He&#39;s just perfection.</p>

"BioChan","2015-04-22T15:14:44.67Z","Pretty Good. Strange Tools...","<p>The second 2015 Bionicle set I acquired is Toa Lewa! At first I was a little apprehensive, his weapon/tool is really odd. However, the other aspects make up for it. As he&#39;s the second Toa from this year, I&#39;ll often make references to Gali, as she was the first.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Not crinkled, the box was a bit hard to open neatly. I resorted to ripping it...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I love the new green that has been used. Similar to Gali, Lewa has been recreated in a more vibrant, modern colour than the 2001 variant. All the parts are good, especially some of the parts that don&#39;t come in other Toa sets. My least favourite are his blades. The top part are recycled (for worse) from Gali. In my opinion, they look too much like water fins than wings. Additionally, the bottom part of the blades were slightly bent, as they often are in other sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Blue Skull Spider...?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very interesting! The torso&nbsp;build was completely different to Gali, where Gali had an armor&nbsp;part on her lower back, Lewa has a blade, which works quite nicely. He required&nbsp;more Technic build techniques than Gali, which was nice.The limbs were simple, and took under 2 minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great! The blade armor on his shoulders are awesome, and completely different to the other Toa. He can move both his arms, and their movement is not impeded by rampant armor. However, there are two thing I don&#39;t like.</p>

<p>1. His gearbox is slightly higher than the other Toa. While this is good for the back blade, it severely&nbsp;restricts the movement of the head. While in flight mode, Lewa is unable to put his head back to see where he is going. While it can be easily solved, it disturbs the look of the blade, making it look like a tail.</p>

<p>2. His weapons are terrible. I like the parts used for the upper section, and they are used well. On Gali. I personally feel that the reuse of them is a bit cheap on&nbsp;Lego&#39;s part. They also don&#39;t work so well as wings, being a bit small.&nbsp;The bottom part of the axes are far worse, being the stock-standard blade part introduced for Chima and Brain Attack HF. I really don&#39;t like this part, mainly due to the fact that I often receive&nbsp;it bent in the box. Bent axes are not a suitable weapon for an agile Toa.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a solid set, the torso build is entertaining, the colours are great, and he has excellent playability (with the flight and ground modes). However, the flaws are noticeable, with my family stating that his weapons are odd. His torso can be fixed by lowering it (if you don&#39;t mind a Toa with a tail...), and the weapons can be replaced by older Bionicle parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like it, overall, and would recommend&nbsp;it if you can replace the weapons. A 4/5 is appropriate, as it is a great set despite the flaws.</p>

<p>The set includes good ol&#39; Lewa, his golden mask,&nbsp;and a blue Skull Spider, who adds a bit of conflict in box. Lewa himself is decently built, the gearbox works fine, allowing him to swing his arms about, the spikes over his shoulders add a bit of personality, and the colour scheme looks good, but the gearbox is positioned a bit too high up, to the point where he can&#39;t move his neck very well. It&#39;s not a deal&nbsp;breaker, but it&#39;s annoying. I&#39;ve heard complaints about his weapons, but they look fine to me, sort of reminiscent&nbsp;of Lewa Nuva&#39;s&nbsp;katanas. The mask looks very&nbsp;aerodynamic and is quite the departure from Lewa&nbsp;Mata&#39;s Miru, but just because it&#39;s different doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad.</p>

"Nmfrey23","2022-01-26T21:20:10.597Z","Lewa must've fallen out of the sky and into the jungle","<p>I really only experienced the original Bionicle series during 2009 and 2010. Despite its discontinuation, I really liked the few sets I did see. So, I can safely say that 10yo me was shocked when I walked into a store and saw Bionicle on shelves again. I didn&#39;t know about the original Toa at the time, and so I decided to check Lewa out. I really thought that they stepped the build up, since the set was more complex than most normal-sized G1 sets while still looking recognizable as a character from that time period.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>New parts:&nbsp;Some familiar looking masks, as well as the&nbsp;knee armour, shoulder armour (in silver), gearbox, chest panel&nbsp;and axes are all new.</p>

<p>Skull Spider build uses new parts.</p>

<p>This set features much more mobility than past Bionicle&nbsp;since it uses CCBS.</p>

<p>The axe heads double as wings.</p>

<p>The gear function works amazingly well, and is reminiscent of the functions from 2001 and 2002.</p>

<p>Overall look: This set does resemble 2001 Lewa quite strongly. The almost smile-like expression of his mask is present in the set, his colours are mostly unchanged, and he still wields an axe.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>CCBS shells create hollow areas in some places.</p>

<p>Open pins and axles: 2 open pins on the back of each arm and an open axle on each axe.</p>

<p>Shoulder armour can loosen.</p>

<p>Lewa&#39;s gearbox is positioned higher than other sets, so he can&#39;t tilt his head back.</p>

<p>Looking back, these Toa sets were very solid by their own merit, and Lewa is no exception. This is a very cool set that can be enjoyed by old and new fans alike. 4/5.</p>
