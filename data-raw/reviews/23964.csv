<p><span lang="""">Hello and Welcome to the review of set number 70785, &quot;Pohatu Master of Stone&quot;. It is ages 7 through 14, includes 66 pieces, and was released the winter wave of the Bionicle line in 2015. So let&#39;s go onto the Skull Spider.</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Skull Spider:</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">So the Skull Spider. It is a dark Metru Blue and includes 5 points of articulation straying away from the usual 4. This is caused by it being a variant of the usual spider, a Skull Scorpion in a way. The spider mask has an excellent mold, but I believe it does not work as well as a scorpion, which could be seen as one of its few faults. Its an OK addition, but it does not have to be here. So let&#39;s go on to the main attraction.</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Pohatu:</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">So Pohatu. He has a burnt orange, silver, and trans. neon green color scheme, which I believe the three mix rather well. Out of all of the Toa, he is not only the shortest, but he also seems to be the least armored, due to him only having his upper torso plate, knee armor, and an armor plate on his upper right arm. This also brings up his asymmetry. Pohatu is the only Toa to not have symmetrical body as he has a trans neon green arm on one side and a black arm on the other and his armor is placed differently on both arms. Some might not like this, but I believe it gives him character, like he found his armor in the desert and placed it on his body. Pohatu has two main functions. He can launch off his mask and he can also move his right arm with a gear system, located on his back. My two biggest issues with Pohatu is with his right arm being translucent and the ball-joints from the original body being exposed. The arm bugs me because it does not look aesthetically pleasing and I do not like the open balls because they rather ugly compared to the rest of the body. His weaponry includes two Stormerangs, which are just two giant boomerangs. They have a few different functions. The Stormerangs could not only be melee weapons, but they can also be used from afar. The Stormerangs are not just weapons though as they can attach to his feet to allow him to access his Adrenaline Mode. He also needs his golden mask to access the mode. The mask does not look great with all of Pohatu&#39;s silver, which I see as an issue. In this form, he can not only glide, but pull out a Rahkshi blade and use it as a secondary weapon. It does not look amazing, but it could give the illusion of him gliding. So now that we have seen Pohatu and his Adrenaline Mode, let us go on to his mask.</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Mask of Stone:</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">So Pohatu&#39;s Mask of Stone. In the set, we get two different variants of the mask. One is in his usual burnt orange, while the other is in his Adrenaline Mode based gold. It is definitely reminiscent of is &#39;01 Kakama, with its mouth vents on the sides and the circle on the mouth, but it seems to be scowling, unlike the original&#39;s rather emotionless appearance. I personally like it and I believe it is one of the three four mask that are similar to their original counterparts. So let&#39;s go on to my final thoughts.</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">Final Thoughts:</span></p>

<p><span lang="""">So my final thoughts. I find Pohatu to be one of the worst Toa, but that is absolutely saying nothing as he is still an amazing set. Not only does he express a lot of character, but he also holds some amazing weapons. I advise you to make the purchase. This is PluralLego and I will see you next time. Goodbye.</span></p>

"123MrBrick","2015-06-29T22:49:04.87Z","Awesome 2015 Toa!","<p>This is my second Bionicle set, the first being 2015 Lewa. I will be making comparisons with that figure.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This figure comes in the nice cardboard hexagon as the other new Bionicle sets. The front has Pohatu in an action pose, and the back shows some features of the set. The instructions were high quality and I had no issues with them.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are pretty common CCBS parts. The masks, weapons, and chest print are unique though. I also think that this shade of brown is fairly uncommon.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The skull spider is the same as the one included with Lewa, although this one has a stinger tail.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty typical for a CCBS set. It took me about ten minutes and I had no problems.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is great! Although he is shorter than Lewa, Pohatu still looks awesome. The trans-green gives him a cool look, and I love the mask piece.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is definitely worth your money. My only complaint is the asymmetry, but that doesn&#39;t really affect the model. A great set!</p>

"LegoLover58","2017-10-26T22:37:06.113Z","Pohatu - Master of Sad Potatoes","<p>I hate this set as much as Pohatu Hates Scorpios.</p>

<p>I&#39;m usually a very passive person when it comes to LEGO sets. However, the best way I can describe this set is as Lazy. I&#39;m usually a HUGE Pohatu&nbsp;nut, but his set just feels...meh.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at the set if you&#39;re wondering what gripes I have with the set.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>I actually kind of dig the 2015 BIONICLE boxes. Sure, they&#39;re not canisters, but what you expect? Plastic Canisters are expensive. Just look at how much they are on Bricklink.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>One of the few things 2015 Pohatu&nbsp;has going for him&nbsp;are his parts. Dark Orange parts make&nbsp;a very welcome return, along with the Trans-Neon Yellow Bones.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This is a BIONICLE set. What do you think?</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is about the same as the other 2015 Masters - CCBS Bones, Gearbox, Shells, you get the idea.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>This is where the figure officially begins to fall apart (not literally, of course.) Pohatu&nbsp;himself just seems so&nbsp;bland&nbsp;and uninteresting. Maybe it&#39;s the lack of shoulder pads; I don&#39;t know. All I know is that I don&#39;t like him.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Is he the worst BIONICLE&nbsp;set ever? No, he&#39;s not a BIONICLE&nbsp;Stars set. However, He isn;t the best BIONICLE set ever either. He&#39;s just somewhere in between.</p>

<p>Overall, Pohatu&#39;s not that great. I do sort of recommend him if you&#39;re a G2 Completionist. Other than that, he&#39;s just alright.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the risk of repeating myself, I say this (quite possibly again): 2015 Pohatu&nbsp;is not the worst BIONICLE set ever made, but he certainly&nbsp;isn&#39;t the best BIONICLE set ever made either. He&#39;s just somewhere in the middle, like a sad Potato.</p>

<p>EDIT: Grammar Issues I caught</p>

"SanMams91","2015-07-17T18:20:21.383Z","Pohatu: One of the best Toa of this wave.","<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing much to look at with the box. It&#39;s just a weirdly-shaped box...with instructions...and pieces packed into two plastic bags. Nice art though!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are awesome in this set...considering this is the first Bionicle I have bought since 2007 and have no idea what Hero Factory was like nor ever bought the sets themselves. Love the trans neon green pieces, the beautiful dark orange and even the generic silver and black pieces.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is nothing special really. It&#39;s a nice introduction to the CCBS system for those that have never previously built models using this system (aka myself). Otherwise, it&#39;s fairly quick.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While I can understand why people have been hating on this figure...for it being too simple for it having too few pieces, etc, etc, etc, I think there&#39;s no excusing the fact that this is one solid figure or set if you will. You can pose him in any way you want, he has these really neat looking boomerangs for weapons, his mask hearkens back to the mask of the original Pohatu, without you thinking about it as a copy of his old mask...I love this toa. I love the colour scheme.&nbsp;I think the neon green actually fits the dark orange perfectly. As for the simplicity of the set itself, I think it actually succeeds in giving the figure his own individual character. By reading the description of the figure online, you find that he is quiet and&nbsp;unyielding...I would also call him a little grim. The figure succeeds in giving away his character...he looks agile, the spikes on parts of his arms tell you he made his own armour out of some rubble in the desert...and mainly, he is one hell of a brawler. I think Pohatu is awesome and severely underrated for his simplicity. All the toa are amazing, and he is no different. Buy him whenever you can.</p>

"timmytowntim","2016-08-27T18:08:56.987Z","""I Hate Scorpios""","<p>Pohatu is the Master of Stone on Okoto in BIONICLE G2 lore. Is he a ferocious sandstorm, or a handful of pebbles? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pohatu is a pretty basic set by 2015&#39;s standards, but that&#39;s what I like about him. He&#39;s nice and compact, and doesn&#39;t tower over the other Toa - he&#39;s the shortest, actually. His mask is&nbsp;reminiscent of the original Kakama from 2001, but not too similar to the point where you can barely tell the difference or anything(i&#39;ll get to you soon enough, Kopaka.).&nbsp;His arms are interesting, one is transparent yellowish-greenish with brown armour&nbsp;and a 2015 armour add on piece, and the other is black with grey CCBS armour.&nbsp;His boomerang weapons are pretty nice, and he has the Guurahk&nbsp;staff tip from 2003&nbsp;on his back that he can use as a little knife of sorts. As a G1 fan, I love that kind&nbsp;of thing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Includes golden mask</li>
	<li>Conflict in box (Skull Spider)</li>
	<li>Colour scheme works</li>
	<li>Nice mask design</li>
	<li>Compact</li>
	<li>Gearbox allows for arm-swinging</li>
	<li>Unique arms</li>
	<li>Guurahk staff piece</li>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Honestly, I&nbsp;don&#39;t think I&nbsp;have any.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, quite the set, especially considering he&#39;s one of the cheaper Toa. I&#39;d choose him over Lewa&nbsp;or Gali for sure.</p>
