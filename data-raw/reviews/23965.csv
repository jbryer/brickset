"BioChan","2015-03-08T23:00:52.5Z","My Childhood Returns!","<p>When I heard that Bionicle was getting rebooted, I was overjoyed. However, when I found that it would be using Hero Factory parts, I was a little apprehensive. My first Bionicle was Water, so I decided to get the first Water Toa of the New Bionicle.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A cardboard &#39;canister&#39; was quite unexpected, however, it was very nicely presented. The instructions inside were in pristine condition.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>CCBS&nbsp;(Creature Character Building System) parts are not my forte, but I really liked the transparent parts. The new mask is sadly incompatible with the old building system.&nbsp;The medium azure&nbsp;looks fantastic, it&#39;s a shame there wasn&#39;t any in the Old Bionicle.</p>

<p>Gali features new tools, which look fantastic. They double as weapons, and swimming fins. The can be put together to make Mermaid Gali!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None, unless the skull spider counts...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Relatively easy, but the gears were very nicely done. The gear system&nbsp;will be very useful for MOCs, both CCBS&nbsp;and Bionicle builds.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It was quite a bit shorter than I had expected, closer analysis shows that the new&nbsp;Gali&nbsp;only comes to about the shoulders of an Inika Toa. I really enjoyed the arm swinging function, but I don&#39;t like the way the shoulder pad&nbsp;moves&nbsp;with the arm. This is easily foxed&nbsp;by placing the shoulder pads on the torso piece. When facing Gali head-on, her eyes are too close together. Her Toa tool looks nice, although when the fins are attached it looks very large. It does&nbsp;look&nbsp;like a Hero Factory set, which is a little bit of a let down.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a good set. The colours balance out nicely, the new weapon part is very nice, and especially fitting for Gali. &nbsp;Having multi-purpose tools is a fantastic idea, as Gali can help Matoran&nbsp;on land, and underwater.&nbsp;The skull spider included is similar to the Krana, of 2002, making a Toa or Matoran a servant of Makuta, can be used to make your Toa fight each other.</p>

<p>The value for money in Australia is not great, being $20 at most shops.</p>

<p>In my opinion, if you want something&nbsp;that really looks like the Old Bionicle, you should get an old one off of eBay. The CCBS parts don&#39;t have much differentiation, so the same parts are used for every Toa. But really, it&#39;s Bionicle, so despite looking like a Hero Factory set, I am glad that it is finally back.&nbsp;</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-07-11T00:09:44.817Z","Depth Charge?!","<p>This is probably my favorite of the smaller 2015 Toa.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This figure, like the rest of Bionicle&#39;s first 2015 wave, comes packaged in a cardboard hexagon, a far cry from the canisters of old. The art on the front is cool and shows Gali fighting for her mask. The back shows the features of the set and has a small comic. The only problem I had with the instructions was that it was hard to notice when they flip the gear assembly around, which led to some confusion on my part.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a great deal of good pieces. The masks, printed chest piece, trident head, and the trans-blue pieces are really cool.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>After getting the dark blue Skull Spider twice, it was nice to get this color, which I like a lot better. However, I think it blends in too much with Gali&#39;s color scheme when attached to her face.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set is fairly simple. As mentioned above, the only part I had trouble with was getting the gearbox right. It was pretty enjoyable to see Gali come together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great! The blue pieces are lighter in color than I expected, which was a welcome surprise. I know some people don&#39;t like the gunmetal because it takes away from the blue, but I like it. The design really works well and definitely looks feminine. The weapon is great in both modes and the arm-swinging function can support it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>You should definitely get this set if you collect Bionicles. Unless one of the other Toa is your favorite, I think you will see that this is the best of the three smaller ones!</p>

"SanMams91","2015-08-09T14:20:08.273Z","Gali, Master of Water","<p>The build</p>

<p>The build is nothing too different from the other models.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is quite a sight to behold. Gali&nbsp;is expertly&nbsp;designed. I find that her shoulder pads were better designed than those of Tahu, even though both figures had the same idea in mind. I enjoy the use of all the translucent blue pieces in her legs, and arms, and quite like her first weapon, named a &#39;harpoon&#39;. She comes with flippers that can be combined to form a mermaid shape which turns out to work quite well for her.&nbsp;Her new mask very much resembles her original 2001 form (despite what many have said...). The proof lies in the intakes on the sides of her mouth, the triangular bottom half shape, the goggles still present on the middle of the mask, along with an added hole on the top (likely the Gali Nuva top mask intake) and a different, spike-like design finishing it off. Her light-piping is excellent thanks to those holes. Her chest printing is also one of the best of the group.</p>

<p>Gali&#39;s design is quite innovative and I like what they&#39;ve done with her character. The one thing I probably like least about her is her other weapon, called the &#39;elemental trident&#39;. One, it looks nothing like a trident, and two, it is much too large for the figure. Even though that is my one complaint about her, you can always choose to pose her with her flippers on her feet. I also feel that her colour scheme is a little bland...it&#39;s just all blue. I think that keetorange, or a bright yellow would have made her my favourite of the wave. She lacks a little bit of the colour&nbsp;diversity that some of the other Toa have.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set, like all the rest of the toa of Bionicle 2015, is excellent. There are almost no flaws to her that I can really legitimately see. She is an excellent figure, fun to play with, and has simply been well designed. Buy her as soon as you can. In fact, I&#39;d suggest that any Bionicle fan buy Pohatu, Lewa, or Gali or all of them first. I think they are the best Toa of 2015 and they are also extremely affordable, which is a massive plus.&nbsp;Bravo, LEGO!</p>

"timmytowntim","2016-08-27T19:00:42.947Z","""Mercy isn't a sign of weakness, Gorast, but of wisdom.""","<p>Gali is the master of water in BIONICLE G2 lore. Is she a tidal wave, or the kiddie pool? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off, Gali&#39;s mask is very different and good looking. I&#39;m glad the set designers were brave enough to try something new instead of playing it safe and&nbsp;re-hashing 2001&#39;s Kaukau. Her colour scheme definitely works, blue, grey and a touch of yellow, and her translucent pieces are pretty nice. So what do I have against this set? Well when you have&nbsp;her&nbsp;weapon in the bigger &quot;axe&quot; form, it&#39;s far too heavy and brings her arm down, since it&#39;s attached&nbsp;to her gearbox that lets her arms swing around by twisting a knob. If you keep her flipper things attached to her feet, you shouldn&#39;t encounter this issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Golden mask is included</li>
	<li>Conflict in box (Skull Spider)</li>
	<li>Nice mask</li>
	<li>Colour scheme works</li>
	<li>Gearbox</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Axe is way too heavy</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not a bad set, though if you can only grab one of the three mid-sized Toa, I&#39;d go for Pohatu.</p>
