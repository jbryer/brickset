"Orbitons8000","2015-01-03T22:34:27.187Z","Born under a Lucky Star","<p>Today, I just bough Tahu, Master of Fire at Mastermind. I absolutley love this set and it is finominal! Lets get into it, shall we?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I, for one, love the new BIONICLE boxes. Their look can capture the buyer by how good it looks. I think LEGO tried to make it look like a canister, but not auctally be A Canister. Props to LEGO for doing an awesome box!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I think the parts are my second&nbsp;favourite part of this set, next to the completed model. There are some new parts, like His Surfboards, His Gearbox, Head, Skull Spider, and Masks. And there is also a bunch of other parts too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The only &quot;Minifig&quot; in it is the AWESOME Skull Spider. It is tea green and is very cool. Thats really all there is to say!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was different from most constraction builds, very VERY fun! I loved building the Gearbox!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>My favourite part of this set! It looks finominal and I am super happy with it. The main Function&nbsp;is you can rotate the gear at the back of Tahu and make his arms slice up and down. You can also use his big silver swords and transform them into his signature Lava Surfboard! I love it!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, LEGO did a finominal job in this set! It is 24.99 CAN and has 89 pieces. I love this set and I think you will too!&nbsp;</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-03-31T15:21:29.86Z","MASTER OF FIYAAAAAAHHHH! FEEL THE POWAAH!","<p>A good friend of mine gave me this for my birthday. And overall, for the posterboy of Bionicle 15, Tahu disappointed me.</p>

<p>BOX/INSTRUCTIONS<br />
The box is large and hexagonal. Go read my Protector of Stone review for more info on the boxes. Instructions are vertically oriented and practically in perfect shape inside. Falling out are two bags of parts and two very large swords.</p>

<p>PARTS<br />
Lots of black bones and red shells. We also get six gold add-ons, the new Hau in red and gold, a spring green Skull Spider, a printed chestpiece, the new gearbox, and the new headpiece. I can&#39;t fault this section.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES<br />
Not applicable... this is Bionicle. The Skull Spider has four legs. They move. It&#39;s a mask. Moving on...</p>

<p>BUILD<br />
It&#39;s really fast. 89 bones and Technic bits don&#39;t take long to assemble.</p>

<p>COMPLETED MODEL<br />
Something&#39;s off about this guy. Maybe it&#39;s the wobbly gearbox. Maybe it&#39;s the hollow shins. Maybe it&#39;s the overabundance of transparent and metallic colors. Or maybe it&#39;s the fact that he has four swords, and every one of them eventually yanks the arms out of their gears... something that drives me insane to no end. I understand that the gearbox and coloring issues are applicable to all of the Toa,&nbsp;but the legs on this figure are Just. Not. Okay. They&#39;re ridiculously out of proportion with the rest of him, for starters. The red torso shells don&#39;t fit at all, and they leave the back of the leg looking entirely bare in comparison to, I don&#39;t know, the ENTIRE REST OF THIS FIGURE! Silver feet are just the icing on the metaphorical mud cake. The arms are designed in such a&nbsp;way that moving the shoulders too far inward yanks them out of the weak gear, which is the only thing it&#39;s connected to.</p>

<p>OVERALL OPINION<br />
The new Master of Fire is a disaster design-wise. The legs, the gearbox, those infuriating torso shells, and the weapons all tick me off. If you have an irrepressable urge to buy Bionicle, get a couple of protectors, Gali, or Onua. But this Toa should be passed over on the shelf.</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-07-28T21:05:20.167Z","He FEELS THE POWAH!","<p>I honestly wasn&#39;t planning to get Tahu. I usually despise LEGO&#39;s main red/fire/hero/leader characters, and the Skull villains looked cool. But I got Tahu because he will be gone from shelves first, and I am pleasantly surprised by how great he is.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like 99% of the 2015 sets, Tahu comes packaged in a cardboard hexagon. I unfortunately have to revoke my previous statement and mention that Tahu&#39;s box was a bit crushed. Anyway, the front and back show Tahu in action along with all of his features. The instructions were easy to follow and there were no errors as far as I could tell.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set includes some great parts. Tahu&#39;s huge swords are fun, and the blended fire pieces are good too. Obviously his masks and printed chest are also draws. I also particularly appreciate that three chest armor pieces were included.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The green Skull Spider is the same as in the other Fire and Earth sets. It is still my favorite variety.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this figure was pretty much the other Toa, (except Onua), but he was a bit bigger so it was a little different of a process.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great. Tahu is taller, and has better proportions, than the other Toa I have. His swords look great and he is just a lot of fun to pose and mess with.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I won&#39;t. No way. It can&#39;t be true. I...</p>

<p>I...</p>

<p>I think Tahu is the best of the five Toa I have.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of red or gold, but Tahu is just a really great figure with a cool design and is definitely the one to get if you only want one 2015 Bionicle set.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2015-07-13T19:40:10.957Z","Back From Death","<p>My last classic Bionicle set was back in 2007 when the story went underwater. Since then I had not bought any Bionicle&nbsp;sets, until now. I was living in Argentina for 2 years as a missionary, so when I came back&nbsp;to the states the return of Bionicle caught me completely off guard as a very pleasant surprise. From the moment I saw Tahu, I knew he was a must have, even if just for the pure nostalgia I have for the Bionicle story.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Having never owned any of the Hero Factory models, I was unfamiliar with the new build system. What surprised me was how much more beefy of a build process this was than my old Tahu&nbsp;&quot;Matu&quot; of 2001, just shows how much LEGO has changed in 14 years... I enjoyed the use of the gearbox, a classic Bionicle throwback. What threw me off was the back section, I accidently built it backwards and had to do it over again.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Tahu has all the same pro&#39;s and con&#39;s of the traditional Bionicle sets. He is a great looking action figure, even though his bell-bottom&nbsp;legs does look a bit goofy (mind you the original Tahu sported some bell-bottom shaped legs too... so maybe, ummm genius easter egg?) Yes there is little to no relation to traditional System building, but that debate has been so hashed over by AFOL&#39;s&nbsp;that it is a moot point. The new armor pieces give Tahu a really, beefed up look, yet give him a somewhat smooth body, strange in comparison to the classic random gears and pistons of the old Bionicle sets. The brain spider thing is a nice addition, but a little pointless. Tahu&#39;s&nbsp;head piece has a cool Terminator-ish look (compared to the gaping open mouth of days past...), yet is a tad annoying&nbsp;with how easy the mask pops off. His sword mount back can be used to give him sword-wings giving him, oddly enough, a Bay-Max &quot;Big Hero Six&quot; type of jive to this Toa of Fire.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>To compare, I broke out my classic Fire Toa sets to compare and contrast. I have a clear favorite... and it is the new&nbsp;Tahu Master of Fire. His body has soooo much more playability&nbsp;than even my Jaller Inika from 2006. Comparing his Fire Mask with the Classic Hau from 2001 is like comparing a car from 2015 with the same model from 2001, the new style just pops out as more complex and aggressive, yet a loving tribute to the classic lines. I liked it, and honestly I would buy more Bionicle models again, although it does not have enough appeal to replace my desires for more complex System style sets.&nbsp;If you have never been a &quot;Constraction&quot; fan this isn&#39;t going to get you into this Lego niche genre, but if you are an old Bionicle fan this is the battle call to come back. And at least it could be an excuse for the now turning adult &quot;original Bionicle generation&quot; to get their siblings/cousins/nephews/children into the fandom.&nbsp;</p>

"SanMams91","2015-08-07T23:43:00.33Z","Tahu is back!","<p>The build</p>

<p>Having already reviewed Pohatu, I found Tahu&#39;s build to be interesting and fun. I enjoyed the similarities between both builds and then discovering the differences in build and design&nbsp;between the two. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I loved Tahu Nuva&nbsp;when I was younger&nbsp;and that was the main factor in my decision making process when debating on whether or not to buy him. I actually have no problems with the bell-bottom look, I feel that as a Toa (or master) of Fire, Tahu should come across as visually&nbsp;flamboyant. This is captured quite well with his unorthodox shoulder design, his splayed-out look, and the massive fire blades that he wields.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a couple of things I did not like about his design, however. Those same shoulder pads I feel could&#39;ve been placed on the ball joints sticking out near his chest, similar to the way Kopaka has his shoulder pads placed. I find this, personally, pleases the eye more than having the shoulder pads placed on a second ball piece next to the connection to his arms. I also dislike that design, and have found that the axle holding his arm into the black gears allow for his arms to slowly slip off, which is a bit of a down-side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tahu&#39;s mask is VERY reminiscent of the original Hau. The design is awesome, but I find that most true when his head is turned and you can see the chiseled&nbsp;angles of his face. The same scowl, intakes, and narrow eyes are also present. Although I was originally not fond of him having blue eyes, they&#39;ve actually grown on me. I also feel that Tahu&nbsp;looks the BEST with his golden mask. It just fits the figure better aesthetically&nbsp;in my opinion, and really recalls the movie design for Toa Likhan in LoMN. The blades are also very well done, and I like him in his surfer mode.</p>

<p>I like Tahu&#39;s chest design (though I have so far liked all of them to be honest) and feel that his two golden swords sticking up and out of his back make him look even more fierce and imposing. A couple more things I will say, however, are that I do wish that his legs had less of those annoying friction joints. They honestly ruin the ability for the figure to be posed and are needless on his hips. I also wish that they had added more translucent orange colours to his legs and arms, which would have made him almost glowing with fire. I think that effect could&#39;ve been mesmerizing to any Bionicle fan.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I honestly dislike having to choose between them, because the whole line is, personally, the most perfect Bionicle line I&#39;ve ever seen released, however, even though I really like Tahu, I find that he is last on my list of&nbsp;Toa. That does not in any way mean he is a bad figure, he really is quite excellent, but I find the designs of his compatriots to be much more interesting or visually enticing than his is.&nbsp;If you want to get one super figure, you love red, Toa of fire, or are a fan of Tahu&nbsp;himself from G1, go buy him. Just like all the other sets, Tahu&nbsp;is a masterpiece in toy&nbsp;design for me.</p>

"timmytowntim","2016-08-27T21:50:14.41Z","""Where wisdom and valor fail, all that remains is faith. And it can overcome all.""","<p>Tahu is the Master of Fire in BIONICLE G2 lore. Is he a searing flame, or is he already burnt? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tahu&nbsp;is one of the larger Toa, and as a result he&#39;ll cost&nbsp;you more, but I&#39;m here to say he&#39;s definitely worth MSRP. The red and gold colour scheme really works out, and his lava surfboard thingy, definitely reminiscent of Tahu Nuva&#39;s&nbsp;weapons, is great. You can split it into two swords, put them together, connect it to his feet, and his little back swords can be used as weapons when his normal swords are being surfed on. It&#39;s brilliant! I also really like the new mask, kinda&nbsp;looks&nbsp;like a modernized&nbsp;Hau, which I&#39;m sure is what they were going for. Throw in the golden mask and the skull spider, and you&#39;ve got a great set on your hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Golden mask is included</li>
	<li>Conflict in box (Skull spider)</li>
	<li>Lava surfboard is fantastic</li>
	<li>Mask looks good</li>
	<li>Nice colour scheme</li>
	<li>Gearbox that allows for arm-swinging,&nbsp;as always</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>I don&#39;t think I have any, honestly.</li>
</ul>

<p>I wasn&#39;t the biggest Tahu&nbsp;fan in G1, so I don&#39;t have too much personal bias, and&nbsp;this set is exceptional. Definitely recommended.&nbsp;</p>
