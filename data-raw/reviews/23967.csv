"Xendor173","2015-02-20T22:06:45.837Z","I never expected...","<p>When news of BIONICLE coming back began spreading, I immediately became excited. BIONICLE is my favorite line of LEGOs, as a kid and to this day. Not only were the sets incredibly detailed, and full of an infinite number of building possibilities, the story was absolutely incredible, involving the reader in so many ways.</p>

<p>When the pictures of the Protectors were leaked, however, I began to have doubts. They do not resemble the unique aspect that the Matoran and Agori had, with varying masks that displayed their own personality. Instead, we ended up with figures who pretty much look the same, with little character distinction other than their weapons and color scheme.</p>

<p>Then, before the pictures of the heroes came out, I saw the term &quot;Master of ___,&quot; and learned they were rebooting the story, rather than expanding on the previous saga. What&#39;s more, the Lord of the Skull Spiders was leaked, and I just stared. Making him the main antagonist is not the BIONICLE way I knew, but more of a Hero Factory thing. While I can understand it is now aiming more to the younger age, it seemed LEGO completely ignored the older fans of BIONICLE.</p>

<p>But then, the images of the Masters were released... and I didn&#39;t doubt it was going to be great.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>In this set, the piece I most anticipated was the mask. I had an image that I wanted to upload, showing the similarities between Toa Kopaka&#39;s mask from 2001 and both his white and gold mask in 2015, but there is no where to upload it from my computer. From the scopes, to the mouth, to the two gaps in his forehead, it is a near-perfect replica. What is even more impressive is the color scheme. Kopaka&#39;s dark grey, white and gold colors fit in perfectly, and the clear blue reminds me of a frozen pool. However, while the gold mask is a perfect addition into the story, it makes his upper body seem to be solid gold, making him seem to be half gold, half white. Not a very good color scheme, so most of the time I keep his white mask on.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Is you can call it that, the minifigure is a small, chrome grey Skull Spider. While at first I was skeptical about these creatures, I began to realize that they actually were more BIONICLE than I thought. Already, BIONICLE villains have led armies of creatures (for example, Ehlek led an army of electric eels against Mahri Nui), and the Bohrok already had the ability to take over another&#39;s mind by knocking off their mask and replacing it with a Krana. In the end, I think he&#39;s pretty cool.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>They have done an amazing job. Unlike the Hero Factory sets, Toa Kopaka has a heavy set of armor that attempts to conceal the underlying skeleton, and does a good job of it. He seems more solid and tougher than any Hero Factory did from 2011 to 2014. And while the build was indeed excessively easier than the previous BIONICLE sets, the functionality and impenetrable look balances it out well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Toa Kopaka looks incredible, and I&#39;m so glad I got him. His functionality includes a gear system where you turn a knob on back to swing his spear arm back and forth, his shield that can be used as two skis, and his eye color, which acts as a switch that pops off his mask. Unfortunately, Kopaka&#39;s mask tends to pop off a bit too easily, especially when you&#39;re trying to turn his head. Still, if you hold onto his upper neck instead of his eye piece or mask, it works well.</p>

<p>As for the Skull Spider, the only downside is it doesn&#39;t fit the way the box shows it does. On the box, it shows you can put all four legs behind the head. However, Kopaka&#39;s chest piece makes it impossible to put the spider on without the front legs extended the other way, giving Kopaka an ugly dual-goatee.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>5 out of 5. Great set, great start, a must buy.</p>

<p>The builds for all of these except for Onua are really quite similar to each other, so I don&#39;t think that would be an area I would put much emphasis on.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Kopaka, bugger that he is, has my tongue frozen in awe. I was not planning to buy Kopaka AT ALL, until I thought about it last minute and decided that I&nbsp;really couldn&#39;t miss out on him. As I mentioned earlier, Kopaka&#39;s build was decent. But the final product&nbsp;was a pleasant surprise. I&#39;ve already heard of people&#39;s qualms with his ankles and how odd they look and will have to agree that from the sides, they do look a tad awkward.&nbsp;I am not particularly bothered by this, however, and I really appreciate LEGO trying to give Kopaka snow shoes or ski boots. I think it&#39;s a nice, but flawed design.&nbsp;In terms of colour scheme, I originally disliked it, because it did not seem to fit in with the character at all. Having him in hand, however, has changed my mind about it. It&#39;s not as beautiful as some of the other colour schemes of the Toa, but it most certainly isn&#39;t the worst of them all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kopaka&#39;s mask is fantastic! I love the curves and the telescopes, which pay homage to the original Akaku mask. Also, the light-piping is perfect for this figure. His arms are a little bulky, but nothing that really interferes with play. I truly adore his torso design, which gives him a sleeker look to him. It looks good, especially with the golden claws for shoulder pads, which can be easily moved out of the way if you&#39;re looking to pose Kopaka&nbsp;any which way you&#39;d like.</p>

<p>I have one&nbsp;real complaint&nbsp;with Kopaka:&nbsp;his shield. I originally disliked the shield very much...it doesn&#39;t look like much of a shield. After awhile, I did get used to it, and found that he takes up much less space with his shield on, than he does when the two white&nbsp;Tahu blades are placed on his feet to form massive skis. The spear I like quite a bit, mainly for its simplicity.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, Kopaka&nbsp;design reminds me of a&nbsp;Greek hoplite, which I think is very neat.&nbsp;If you honestly want to spend $30 CAD (or equivalent) for an excellent buildable figure, that has loads of articulation,&nbsp;looks great, and can smack things with a spear, buy Kopaka. He&#39;s more than I expected and I am very glad to have added him to my collection.</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-09-05T16:16:47.623Z","Hello? Yes? I'd like to revoke my previous statement about Tahu.","<p>I really only bought Kopaka just to complete the Toa team, but he has evolved into my favorite of all six, and perhaps my favorite of the entire reboot so far. Read on to find out why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like most of the other BIONICLE reboot figures, Kopaka comes in a cardboard hexagon, one of the larger ones. The front has a nice shot of him near his Golden Mask while a Skull Spider tries to get it. The back shows the actions features, the &quot;adrenaline&quot; mode, and a small comic about him saving the Protector of Ice. I still have yet to see one of these boxes in damaged condition. The instructions are rather small, but have no errors. They have the same comic at the front, but with an additional panel, and the back has a picture of the Toa, their Golden Masks, and the Mask of Creation. All standard fare.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has a wealth of nice, new pieces, as well as a good mix of regular CCBS pieces. Obviously, the mask is new and looks fantastic, but this is the only set that comes with the shield piece in white, and the Protector of Ice is the only other set with the white armor add-ons.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with a silver Speed Skull Spider. Nothing too special.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set was pretty much the same as the other Toa, except Kopaka had some armor added to the back of his legs.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is great! Kopaka is very poseable, his action features (swinging arms and launching mask) are fun and work well, and he has a very distinct, slightly top-heavy look. I like that his lower legs sort of evoke heavy boots, seeing that he is climbing snowy mountains.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a very nice set. While Onua is heavy, Kopaka just feels very solid and sturdy. His weapons are very nice, as well. If you are interested in BIONICLE, don&#39;t hesitate to get this one before it&#39;s gone!</p>

"flarefish","2015-12-03T16:38:29.393Z","So much ice (still has room for gold and gunmetal)","<p>I personally&nbsp;like this set. Kopaka&nbsp;has always been one of my favorite toa and this new version of him has to be the best yet.Kopaka&#39;s colour scheme of white, gold and silver looks really good. He has translucent bone pieces on his arms and legs as well as most of his weaponry&nbsp;which look nice to the eye. He comes with a gunmetal gray skull spider which doubles up as a mask, another add on in the set is the golden mask of ice which can be equiped&nbsp;to make him look...gold? At the time of reviewing this I do not own the protector of ice and dont know what the combo modle&nbsp;looks like with the mask on. Now more on the head/mask.The normal white mask and the gold mask have serious expressions and a really cool goggle eye thing,the skull spider has a angry look and its gunmetal colour goes well with the set. The head itself is gunmetal and has a funtion: if you press down on a switch at the back the translucent area flicks forward and launches&nbsp;the mask of- its actually really fun to do that. :P This set has lots of functions: first of if you consider articulation a function it has plenty: 3 in the legs,3 in the arms 1 in the head and thats about it. Kopaka has a mask laucher&nbsp;on his head(just said that, derp) he also has a epic gear system on his back that makes his arm go forward and backward by twisting a nob. He can also take of his shield and put it on as skies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>Good articulation</p>

<p>Lots of translucent pieces</p>

<p>Many masks</p>

<p>Good colour&nbsp;scheme</p>

<p>Fun to build</p>

<p>Strong and not easy to break</p>

<p>Nice functions&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much gunmetal no doge(sorry i just had to do that)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>Exposed bone pieces (excluding the translucent ones)</p>

<p>Shoulder pads get in the way of the arm while using the function</p>

<p>Just why gold and gunmetal</p>

<p>Overall a good set to add to your collection, I do recommend it to you.</p>

<p>Kopaka is the Master of Ice in BIONICLE G2 lore. Is he a mighty iceberg, or a single snowflake? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kopaka&nbsp;might be&nbsp;my favourite&nbsp;Master, maybe second to Tahu.&nbsp;He looks great for starters, the legs are really bulky, even from behind, the shield looks good, the spear is pretty average, though it uses the Guurahk staff piece from 2003, always a nice touch, and his colour scheme of white, gold, blue and silver works pretty well. If you put on his golden mask, he looks significantly worse in my opinion. All the gold is bunched up at he top and it just looks... Bad. Keep the white mask on, and you won&#39;t have any problems with that. Speaking of masks, Kopaka&#39;s new mask looks strikingly similar to his original Akaku, and that kind of bugs me. Would it have killed them to mix it up a bit? (As proven by Uniter Kopaka, no, it wouldn&#39;t have.)&nbsp;He also has stickers on his leg armour, which I&#39;m not too happy about. He keeps all the good from the other Masters though, a skull spider is included, he has a gearbox that lets him swing his arm, you get the&nbsp;golden mask, etc. The good far outweighs the bad.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Golden mask is included</li>
	<li>Conflict in box (Skull spider)</li>
	<li>Gearbox, as always</li>
	<li>Looks great</li>
	<li>Colour scheme works well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Looks pretty bad with golden mask on</li>
	<li>Mask isn&#39;t very different</li>
	<li>Stickers</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite my complaints, I think Kopaka is a great set. Whether&nbsp;you should get him or Tahu is completely&nbsp;up to you, though.</p>
