"psoren","2015-01-08T03:19:00.72Z","The Onua reboot is very well done","<p>I am an avid Bionicle fan. &nbsp;When I heard that they were restarting the theme, I was very excited. &nbsp;After searching 4 Wal-Marts for the sets, I went to the Lego Store where they had all of them. &nbsp;I bought Onua Master of Earth and went home to build him.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was much bigger than expected. &nbsp;While it is a box and not a canister like the old ones had, the box is still very nice. &nbsp;The instructions were very nice and explained the build well.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I have many of the old Bionicle sets, and as such I am accustomed to seeing many of the pieces. &nbsp;This set came with many pieces I had not seen before, such as the pieces that comprise the legs and arms. &nbsp;The armor clips on the sides of the legs and arms; a feature I had not seen before. &nbsp;I really like his hammer/digging claws. &nbsp;It really makes him look like a big, tough dude.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is much bigger than the original Toa Mata Onua. &nbsp;I really like what Lego has done this time around, giving each of the Toa different pieces to give them each a little different personality. &nbsp;Onua Master of Earth is a really cool looking set. &nbsp;His armor really fills him out well and the stickers on his chest really benefit him.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was not sure at first how the Bionicle reboot would fare, but from Onua Master of Earth I am very excited. &nbsp;Onua is a huge set and I would definitely recommend him. &nbsp;If you are an old Bionicle&nbsp;fan getting back into it, or a newcomer wondering what Bionicle&nbsp;is all about, definitely buy this set.</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-07-23T01:01:44.83Z","He always stands firm.","<p>I got this set on clearance for $15 USD, but it is definitely worth the full price. Onua is the most visually distinct of the Toa, and has a good shot of being my favorite of the 2015 designs.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set, like most of the 2015 sets, comes in a cardboard hexagon. Onua comes in the largest size of box. The front shows him attacking the Skull Spider near his Golden Mask and the back shows his combo mode, his adrenalin mode, and a small comic about him claiming the Golden Mask. The instructions were easy to follow and I found no errors.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has the second best price per piece of the wave, the number one spot going to LoSS. Onua has some great parts, like the four hammer/claw pieces, the pearl gray Ben 10 foot, and, of course, the masks. This set has no printed pieces, which is a plus and a downside. It is good because it allows the chest piece to be reused more easily, but the downside is that there are stickers that must be applied to the chest. Unless you want this set for MOCs, I highly recommend applying the stickers because it makes Onua match the other Toa.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Skull Spider included in this set is a dullish lime green. I thought this variety would glow in the dark, but I was wrong. This is probably my favorite Skull Spider variant.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set was very different from the other Toa. Onua has a very wide frame, so some clever and unusual techniques are used. It was not complicated, though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great! Even at the $20 price point, I was surprised at Onua&#39;s size and bulk. He has awesome weapons and just looks powerful. My only complaint is that the arms and legs use the dark gray extenders, which make posing the limbs or using the action feature a little harder.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a very good Bionicle set. I was a bit skeptical at first because he has stickers and looked a little too much like the CHI Gorzan Ultrabuild, but having it in hand tells a different story. You should purchase it now that it is on sale in some areas.</p>

"SanMams91","2015-08-09T14:32:09.913Z","Onua, yet another impressive figure from LEGO","<p>The build</p>

<p>Onua&#39;s build is the most different of all the 2015 toa. It&#39;s a fairly fun, yet simple&nbsp;build.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Onua, like&nbsp;Kopaka, surprised me very much. You begin by building his legs going upward. I find Onua&#39;s legs to be the most well-designed or even complete legs of all the 2015 Toa. I love how the trans-purple bones blend in with the golden knee armour, as well as the black shells. I really admire Onua&#39;s feet pieces, which differentiates him even more from the rest of the Toa. I find his colour scheme to be one of the best of the six figures as well. I find his torso build to be very clever, using a large shell piece for the abdomen and then a Hulk-like black torso piece to cover all the bits and gears of the figure&#39;s skeleton sticking out. I like how his shoulder pads look, and love that you can give him claws. I&#39;m not as big a fan of the big hammer weapon that he wields, but the great thing about it is that you can precisely give him his claws, and place the rest of the weapon on his back for storage. Very clever design.</p>

<p>His mask is still my least favourite of the Toa, but honestly, that isn&#39;t saying too much. He has excellent light-piping, the mask actually fits the character well and doesn&#39;t stick out at all. It is also very reminiscent of the old Pakari, which I disliked greatly. I think this is a fantastic upgrade to that mask. Onua still keeps his hunched over position, and you can change that if you like, as Onua has the best neck articulation of the six Toa. His arms I find to be an issue, considering they are connected to his torso via those friction joints, which I greatly dislike. It makes Onua a little more difficult to pose.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<h3>I love this figure much more than I thought I would. He&#39;s definitely worth his price in my opinion and would greatly recommend him to anyone. Fantastic work, LEGO!</h3>

"timmytowntim","2016-09-02T23:59:19.623Z","""You did not defeat the Toa Nuva -- We simply found your company so boring, we chose to take a nap.""","<p>Onua is the Master of Earth in BIONICLE G2 lore. Is he a raging earthquake, or a bag of soil? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Onua is definitely&nbsp;the most unique Master - no doubt about that. He&#39;s much shorter and much wider than the other Toa in his price bracket, and honestly, I think he&#39;s the worst of the larger sets. He doesn&#39;t look like a hulking brute, he looks like he was stepped on. His hammer can be disassembled&nbsp;to create claws&nbsp;reminiscent&nbsp;of 2001 Onua&#39;s&nbsp;very own&nbsp;<em>shredder&nbsp;claws</em>. His mask also looks a bit like Onua Mata&#39;s Pakari from &#39;01, but it&#39;s definitely different enough, and he has some purple limbs and armour, something we haven&#39;t seen enough of in CCBS. He has a gearbox that allows him to swing&nbsp;his arms around,&nbsp;and, of course, comes with his golden mask and skull spider.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Confict in box (skull spider)</li>
	<li>Golden mask is included</li>
	<li>Gearbox, as always</li>
	<li>Purple</li>
	<li><em>Shredder claws</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Height and length</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not a bad set by any means, but if you can only get one larger Master, I&#39;d advise against him, especially when both Tahu and Kopaka&nbsp;are much better options.</p>
