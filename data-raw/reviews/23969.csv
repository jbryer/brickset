<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The new box style is very interesting because Lego used a different company for their boxes called &quot;G Box.&quot; The new style box is cool because of its angular edges. The instructions are the same style as any other Lego set. One picture with a side view showing the yellow gears is a little frustrating because it will NOT line up the way it says it&#39;s supposed to.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Almost every single part on here has already been made, it&#39;s just a new color. One of the only new pieces is the golden mask of the Skull Spiders.?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was mostly a Technic-style build with good instructions except where noted above. It was a very quick build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once completed, it&#39;s a very nice model. I like the feature where you press on the back and his&nbsp;legs try to trap another figure.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is not my absolute favorite Bionicle model, but still a very great one!</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-07-13T23:34:11.227Z","""We Can't Outrun Him."" -Pohatu","<p>The mid-sized Bionicle sets are being discounted to make room for the new wave. I picked up LoSS (Lord of Skull Spiders) for $11. This is a really great set that will definitely appeal to fans of the old Bionicle.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes packaged in a cardboard hexagon, like the other new figures. Despite the common complaint, I have yet to see a single figure in my area with a crushed box. It has some cool art of LoSS on the front and shows his grab feature on the back. It also has a small comic, which wastes most of its panels showing the Protector of Fire struggling before he finally grabs the Golden Skull Spider mask.&nbsp;LoSS then wraps him up in web. The instructions were easy to follow and I spotted no issues.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set, unlike the others, mostly consists of Technic pieces, with a few CCBS pieces for bulk. There are a couple that look new to me, but I&#39;m not sure. The face is printed on a chest armor piece, and I would love to see it used on a MOC in a creative way. The Golden Mask of Skull Spiders is exclusive to this set and looks pretty cool. While LoSS cannot wear this mask, it grants him control over the Skull Spider hordes.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set was kind of challenging. I got confused at a few parts, but I was able to figure it out. Surprisingly, attaching the rubber band piece was very easy. I appreciate the challenge, because it was even more rewarding to see the set completed.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is great. It has a lot of cool details and looks suitably menacing. The grabbing feature works well, but it is hard to pick anything up with it. Despite the exposed Technic handle towards the back, the overall model is still great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think even fans who don&#39;t like the new Bionicle figures will appreciate this set because it is mostly a Technic build. It looks great and has some cool trans-orange pieces. My only complaint is that it is pretty small compared to the Toa and is only really a threat to a Protector. Maybe a larger, $30 version would be better. Either way, the one we got is still cool and is definitely worth your consideration.</p>

"terratyrant30","2015-12-07T21:32:17.393Z","Not exactly the Lord of skull spiders","<p>This set is quite cool, with a higher piece count than other Bionicle sets and various cool pieces that can be used for customizing or creating Bionicle Mocs&nbsp;and features a pretty useful action feature, which can be used to slice or grab the good bionicle heroes. However in terms of size, if compared to a Toa( large elemental figure) there is a complete difference in height as the toa is much taller and this is kinda meant to be the final boss for wave 1 so its a bit confusing. However on the good terms I have to remember that Lego still has its piece count restrictions for sets and on the amount of pieces they have, they have done an amazing job to depict this Lord of Skull Spiders.</p>

<p>Lord of the skull spiders is my only Bionicle and it is great .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build starting with the head has a nice armour plate with an eye and teeth print , the legs are built with technic and there are six of them , his back is played off nicely and his inside is built out of cogs , technic and an elastic band . The main feature is on the back where the handle resides and there is a lever there and when you pull it the legs move simultaneously this is a great feature that I have never gotten bored of . The extra inclusion is one of the masks from the theme winch is admittedly a cool piece .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this has one of my favourite Lego play features and it is also one of my favourite sets so I would recommend it to any Lego fan of play features .</p>
