<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As always, the box is great. &nbsp;Too bad not all Lego sets utilized this box design style, especially larger, more expensive sets. &nbsp;Standard style book design as found in most other Architecture sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You will find LOTS of repetitive&nbsp;parts styles. &nbsp;The set contains 274 pieces (predominantly white), of which 85 are the 1x1 round &quot;dot&quot;/plates with hole in top. &nbsp;Also, includes 46 short white rods (light sabers?!) which form all the columns.</p>

<p>There are four White Panel 2 x 2 x 1 Corner pieces which are pretty cool. &nbsp;Some olive green tile pieces are nice&nbsp;too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Nope!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not exciting, somewhat monotonous but that&#39;s to be expected.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once completed, the model is pretty compact and about&nbsp;the same&nbsp;scale of original Architecture models (i.e. Sears Tower/Space Needle etc.). &nbsp;I&#39;m an architecture fan and enjoy the Lego Architecture line (having all models in the category with the exception of the Robie House), but don&#39;t expect this model to WOW you. &nbsp;One nice design element is that the roof can easily be removed which allows a peak in to the interior and the &quot;statue&quot; of President Lincoln.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This particular model is not particularly overwhelming. &nbsp;It would definitely be a big fail for kids and is entirely geared to AFOL. &nbsp;Unless you are a collector of the Architecture series I would not recommend this model however. &nbsp;If you ARE a Lego Architecture collector, then this is obviously a must-buy. &nbsp;Personally, I am looking much more forward to the Flatiron Building when it is eventually released later in the year.</p>

"jimred","2015-04-12T09:09:42.407Z","Small but perfectly formed","<p>I bought this set purely as a parts pack, but I do like the landmark architecture series, so had a quick build of it...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Usual good quality architecture box and instructions. Some nice history and pictures of the real thing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>If you want white apollo studs (85+2) and 3L (46+1) bars then this is the set to get. Olive green tiles are nice (four 2x4 and three 1x6). I believe the only exclusive part is the &#39;Lincoln Memorial&#39; printed tile.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One white microfigure which acts as Lincoln&#39;s Statue. There were 3 of these in the Trevi Fountain, so not exclusive, but could be useful.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very straightforward, you find your self anticipating the next few steps as you build because the instructions are really broken down. It won&#39;t take you long.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Now this is it. Everything so far has been pretty ho hum. But the finished model took me by surprise. It is smaller than I expected, but perfectly formed. There is something I find very pleasing about it&#39;s compact neatness and that makes it a very attractive display model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roof lifts off so you can peak inside at the statue in it&#39;s chair.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set is certainly geared towards the more serious side of the market. It will be useful for some as a parts pack, and will naturally appeal to fans of architecture and landmarks. It&#39;s a nice set to have on display, as no flimsy-sticky-out bits to knock off and it does look pleasing on the eye. I think this would be a great add-on set if you have the architecture studio. Not only for the white parts, but for the olive green and base parts to create surroundings for your own creations.</p>

"Duq","2016-08-31T18:21:31.793Z","It's all a bit meh","<p>The reason I bought this set is that I needed a few dozen white round studs with a hole in the middle as well as some white bars and this set has plenty of them. Once I had it I figured I might as well build it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As this is one of the smaller Architecture sets it&#39;s no surprise that it comes in a fairly small box. The back of the box shows an element that&#39;s not obvious from the main picture: it has an interior. The 68 page book is typical for the Architecture series; some photos of the prototype, a bit of history, and easy to follow instructions on good quality paper.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s pretty unusual for two parts to make up half the parts count in a set but that&#39;s the case here; the round studs and bars account for 131 of the 274 parts. There&#39;s also a few white bricks and plates for the walls clear plates and cheese slopes for a sky light, black plates and tiles for the base and olive green tiles for the grass. And there&#39;s a plain white microfig.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is not the most interesting model to build. The construction is simple and putting up the 46 columns is rather tedious.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s small! The base is 12x16 studs, the actual model is only 8x12. You can lift the roof off to see the statue inside and with enough light from above you can just about make it out through the columns at the front. Apart from that it&#39;s a box surrounded by columns.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not American, so the fact that this is Lincolns memorial has no special meaning to me. Without that meaning it&#39;s a fairly plain structure that is not particularly interesting to build.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re into American history or you&#39;re a serious Architecture fan you can safely give this one a miss.</p>

"Mystical_Møøse","2017-07-23T15:44:40.59Z","A solid introduction to the Architecture theme","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard for &#39;premium&#39; sets: nice reusable box, and perfect bound instructions, with information about the real thing at the front. The box itself is a rather classy, with the white of the model contrasting nicely with the black background.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing to interesting to be honest, but olive green tiles and 85 1x1 round plates with hole are sure to be useful. I noticed that the white pieces don&#39;t seem to be all the same quality; there is a bit of variation of colour present which is disappointing. This issue seems to plague a lot of newer sets, unfortunately though.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Repetitive is how it could be described, as there are 46 columns to build. The set seems to receive a lot of criticism for this, but it&#39;s difficult to see how else it can be replicated. While they can be easily pushed out of place, the rest of the build is satisfyingly solid. It took about 15-25 minutes.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s nice. It looks good on a desk, and the limited palette is quite attractive. The skylight does indeed allow light to shine in, and when a torch is shone through it shows Lincoln nicely. It is further easy to remove to allow easier access to the figure himself. To be honest, I&#39;m not completely in love with the design of the chair, but it serves its purpose. What&#39;s also notable is that it&#39;s very small compared to the box. According to the box its about 6cm tall and 13cm long. It&#39;s the perfect size to put on a desk, but the large box leads you to expect more in terms of size.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not a perfect set, but it&#39;s a nice one and the final model is very attractive. I received it as a gift, so I do not know the price it was purchased at, but the RRP seems rather high, but that seems to be expected with the Architecture theme. This is my first set in the theme, and it&#39;s definitely given me an interest in other sets in the theme. I&#39;d probably give it a 7/10 overall.</p>
