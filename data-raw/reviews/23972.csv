<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and manual are perfect for the set. Nothing notable to mention here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has your typical croc&nbsp;set tooth and mouth pieces, and one exclusive banner. The banner is perhaps the best part of the set if you own a lot of Chima stuff. You might have a lot of croc figures and pieces, but you don&#39;t have this banner without this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One of the high points is getting nice looking exclusive figures. Two of them are the same random generic croc&nbsp;person, and one of them is named&nbsp;General Crokenburg. This is the only set that you get either figure&nbsp;in, so it&#39;s a must for hardcore figure collectors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For a 72 piece set, the build isn&#39;t going to be that engaging no matter what anyone does. However,&nbsp;if you decide to set it up on another croc set, you will likely&nbsp;have to make some creative modifications. I spent a bit of time figuring out how to make it all work with other sets, and found that to be enjoyable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks fine for the piece count, but the disconnected elements would be hard not to misplace over time. For that reason,&nbsp;I set everything up attached to&nbsp;the bottom level of&nbsp;my Swamp Hideout, and now that&nbsp;set looks&nbsp;like a much better defended&nbsp;fortress. Someone who didn&#39;t know about&nbsp;Chima&nbsp;sets&nbsp;would think that the hideout was supposed to have these parts.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite being tiny, this has all the expected elements of any crocodile set, and goes along with any of the many croc sets out there. This&nbsp;along with the exclusive pieces makes this a great buy for Chima fans. It&#39;s technically not a good value purely based on piece count per dollar, at over 10 cents per piece, but the fact that most of those pieces are minifigures makes up for that.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T02:26:07.057Z","Build an Army of Crocodiles","<p><strong>Set #70231 Crocodile Tribe Pack:</strong> Another Legends of Chima battle pack from the last wave and this one includes some impressive Minifigures, the model is what you&rsquo;ve come to expect from these sets, still it&rsquo;s a great cheap way to build up a small army for battling for CHI.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: Legends of Chima boxes never fail to disappoint, even when on such a small scale. I enjoy the use of flames for the final batch of box designs. On the back LEGO suggests pairing up this set with 70223 for a battle in a box kind of situation.</p>

<p>Instructions: Like the other Battle Packs from this wave you get some easy to follow instructions with cross-promotions and a Minifigure checklist in the back. It&rsquo;s a pretty decent booklet for such a small set.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The crocodile tribe flag is the big unique part from this set, everything else is fairly common, though the swamp green colours are a nice touch. Not much for MOC parts packs, but great for army builder fans.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Crockenburg: The named warrior in this set and member of the Crocodile Tribe, Crockenburg includes a decent amount of printing, with more detail, compared to his nameless warriors on his leg printing, a double-sided torso, single-sided face and a head piece with printing for the lower steel jaw he has. It would appear he lost the lower half of his mouth during battle. Accessories include a piece of Fire CHI, some armour and a weapon made from a trident and a lightsaber blade in pearl gold.</p>

<p>Overall, a decent Minifigure with an interesting look to him, perhaps hinting at a grizzled war veteran who has seen much in his long years of service to the tribe.</p>

<p>Crocodile Warrior: Both warriors have the exact same printing, the same double-sided torsos, single sided heads, leg printing, head piece printing, everything is identical making them ideal for fans of army building. The only differences between them are the accessories, one includes the stud shooting blaster which has become a stable of LEGO sets, while the other includes a blade and shield combination with flaming CHI energy to do battle against the Ice Tribe members.</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>Like with the other battle packs to discuss the build separately would be a bit silly. You&rsquo;re basically making a small fortification and the model does a pretty good job of looking like the front of a crocodile, with a long snout full of teeth and two side pieces that feature the front legs it is what it is. The disc launcher is a nice functional play feature and the flag, as always, stands out as very nicely executed. It&rsquo;s a decent little model to go alongside larger Crocodile Tribe sets.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t go wrong with these battle packs, the fact that they&rsquo;ve sold out by now is a testament to their popularity. I recommend these for the army building fun that can be had, the set is a great cheap little set with tons of potential.</p>
