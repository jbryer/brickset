It comes with 3 Lego figures, an Octopus and a Crab (that has a penchant for gems...), a Pirate Raft that features a slingshot for the cylindrical cannon &#39;balls&#39;, a spring fire cannon, treasure chest with 4 individually coloured gems, green bottle and fish.</p>

<p>The build itself was enjoyable, with parts coming in numbered bags, you build the raft first, the Outpost second. There seems to be new bricks in the outpost, a cube brick with slopes cut into it to symbolize rock and a lime green palm frond. The cannon is now metallic grey as opposed to the dull solid grey Pirate and Army cannons used to have.</p>

<p>The figures have detailing on both the front and back of their torsos, the bandana the Pirate wears, is also a newly moulded piece, and the facial expressions and facial hair detailing on both the capless officer and Pirate seem like new faces that haven&#39;t been duplicated in Lego before. The &#39;Shako&#39; cap the Solider wears has paint detailing on the feather and a crest on the front of it too and you will all be pleased to know NO STICKERS are in this set! The flag is a tampo print! The Outpost is a sturdy small construction, squat too, it has the ability to connect to the larger 70412 &#39;Soldiers Fort from the 2015 Pirates theme and while this is good, I do feel Lego have simply divided the few Pirates sets so as to make more bang for their buck so to speak...it feels as if this set needs something else to it really. This connectable feature is also present in sets 70409 &#39;Shipwreck Defence&#39; which can connect to 70411 &#39;Treasure Island&#39;.</p>

<p>My gripes are the price (see below), the crows nest of the Raft adds a cream square studless plate inside it and this doesn&#39;t help secure the figure when he is stood in it, so I suggest removing this altogether, its not needed. Perhaps it would have been better served with a map being printed onto this plate for the Pirate, as he does seem to be a castaway, or a survivor of a capsized Pirate ship...Maybe if he had been supplied a map, he may not have run into the Outpost in the firstplace?! I also did not like how the mast of the Raft is attached simply to a stud on the plate it rests on, as well as the Crows Nest resting precariously atop the Raft, it comes off too easily. I also felt that the set should have consisted of 4 figures,&nbsp;2 Soldiers, 2 Pirates and featured the Pirates Of The Carribean sword holders that fit onto the figures.</p>

<p>You do get a few spare pieces, some that come to mind are another sword and pistol so you can arm the Officer with a cutlass and the Pirate with a Flintlock, as well as spare epaulettes in white and gold....</p>

<p>This is a very colourful and playable&nbsp;set, but its &pound;18.00 cost is still, in my opinion, too dear, its more worth &pound;10.00 in all honesty but as an all new Pirates themed, non - licenced set, its great to see more &#39;traditional&#39; Lego Theme&#39;s back in toyshops and I would recommend you buy it.</p>

<p>I actually enjoyed the simplicity of the package design: a plain yellow box with the theme&#39;s logo and crisp photos of the set.&nbsp; No fancy patterns or artwork to distract from the product.&nbsp; The instructions have the parts divided into two bags: one for the raft and one for the outpost.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a few noteworthy parts: several new dark red 1x2 bricks with the actual brick pattern, palm leaves in the newer lime green, an octopus, a crow&#39;s nest, a trans green bottle, a white cloth &quot;sail&quot;, a printed Imperial flag, four <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4210702"">2x2 inverted-corner bricks</a>, four <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4636170"">brown 4x4 quarter-circle plates</a>, and two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4215470"">white 4x4 bow bricks</a>.&nbsp; Oh yes, and a pull-fire cannon.&nbsp; Can&#39;t forget about that.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The printing on the torsos of both the soldiers and the pirate is quite nice.&nbsp; I was skeptical about the new pirate bandana design from the pictures, but it&#39;s not as bad as I thought it would be.&nbsp; That said, I still prefer the old pirate bandana.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure why they thought it necessary to make a new mold.&nbsp; The printing on the soldier&#39;s hat is excellent, and the officer&#39;s hair is the newer slicked-back look.&nbsp; Fun expressions on the faces.&nbsp; The pirate&#39;s face hearkens back to the old mustachioed minifig heads, but the printing and expression are much better now.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing too exciting, but it was engaging enough for ten minutes.&nbsp; The outpost is a sturdy little structure with some nice detail for a set so small.&nbsp; The raft isn&#39;t bad-looking either, and the white cloth &quot;sail&quot; is a nice touch.&nbsp; I could see a couple of them being used on micro-scale pirate vessels.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set looks pretty good as is, but so many of the parts are too useful not to be taken for MOCs.&nbsp; There isn&#39;t much by way of play functions, aside from the canon (which is mounted on a 4x4 pivoting base) and the miniature catapult (which is likewise mounted on a rotating base, though 2x2).&nbsp; A clip is left open beneath the smooth brown plank on the right side of the outpost so it can connect to the larger <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70412-1/Soldiers-Fort"">Soldiers Fort</a> set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Well worth $19.99.&nbsp; It&#39;s a fun little throwback to its predecessors, with some lovely newer parts.&nbsp; We&#39;ll probably be buying a few more from this Pirates line.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A printed soldier flag, a crab and an octopus provide some excellent character. &nbsp;The raft&#39;s sail is a white tattered cloak and works very well here. &nbsp;There is also a cannon and some red 2x1 brick-patterned bricks. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigures are fairly standard, a&nbsp;soldier with epaulettes and backpack, an officer with gold epaulettes&nbsp;and a pirate. &nbsp;Nothing particularly exciting but good additions to a pirate and soldier army.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Both the raft and fort are fairly simple models, the only slightly non-standard element is the sides of the raft set at 90 degrees. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The raft, especially with the tattered sail, looks very good. &nbsp;The fort is nicely non-symmetrical and also looks good. &nbsp;The raft and the fort are about the same size and they feel evenly matched, although you may need more pirates.</p>

<p><strong>As Part of the Pirate Line</strong></p>

<p>This is common to all of my pirate set 2015 reviews. &nbsp;Lego has made the 4 smaller sets 70409, 10, 11 and 12 as parts of a greater whole. &nbsp;This set pairs with 70912, Soldiers Fort, attaching via a single claw part, such that this fort sits on the end of the jetty. &nbsp;Sets 70409 and 11 pair up similarly. &nbsp;Out of the two pairings, the two pirate sets have&nbsp;more character.</p>

<p>Taken together, all 4 sets are around the equivalent of a King&#39;s Castle set. &nbsp;Slightly cheaper, with two thirds the number of pieces but double the minifigs and more variety. &nbsp;And, I would argue, more playability. &nbsp;Although it&#39;s true that with all Lego, more sets = more playability, this is the first instance I&#39;m aware of where the sets are very specifically designed to be combined (outside simple extensions, like the Helm&#39;s deep castle wall). &nbsp;As a whole, these 4 sets have a huge amount of enhanced playability when put together, forming little islands around which the many boats and creatures can move, or two long opposing structures facing off against each other. &nbsp;It&#39;s a great idea for the pirate line and it comes off very well.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is a nice looking little set. &nbsp;However, it is hard to recommend this one given that 70911, Treasure Island, is the same price and just generally more fun. &nbsp;However,&nbsp;when you add this set to the others it becomes much better. &nbsp;It is intended to be paired with Soldier&#39;s Fort, but I would argue it works as well if not better opposite Treasure Island. &nbsp;With more pirates against it and a boat for the soldiers, this set would really come into its own. &nbsp;If you plan to get those two together, I would add half a star to this. &nbsp;If you plan to get all four sets, I would put this up to 5 stars, as part of the whole the raft and the addition to the fort is excellent.</p>
