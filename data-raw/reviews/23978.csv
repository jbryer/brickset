"Bobsy","2015-04-05T10:48:05.883Z","A welcome surprise","<p>There&#39;s something about the quintessential &#39;red Ferrari&#39; that bugs me. It&#39;s too dull, too trite, too... Top Gear. I hadn&#39;t intended to buy this entry in the Speed Champions line, preferring at a glance the apparently classier aesthetic of the Porsche 918 Spyder, but I&#39;m extremely glad I did. The LaFerrari is one hell of a model, and well deserving of a place in most collections.</p>

<p>&nbsp;
<h3>Parts</h3>
</p>

<p>There are a few interesting pieces to note. Firstly, the canopy is pretty unique and well suited to plenty of other MOC vehicles, contemporary or sci-fi. In addition the wheel-arch bricks, though found across the Speed Champions line, seem new here, although being large and chunky won&#39;t be particularly adaptable. The tires come with changeable hubcaps, but with nowhere to store the second set they easily risk being lost. A nice idea, but not nearly so exciting as LEGO seems to think. As you&#39;d expect from a sleek, modern sports car, there are plenty of smooth curved pieces of various sizes and shapes, but a great many of these are covered by stickers.</p>

<p>Yes, a word of warning for those why abhor stickers - while this is far from being the worst offender among the Speed Champions sets, there&#39;s still plenty to have to apply. Dainty fingers (or in my case, a pair of tweezers) are needed to put the stickers on properly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One race car driver, decked out in a Ferrari-themed suit. Boring, and just <em>asking </em>to be replaced by someone more interesting. Put Bruce Wayne or Tony Stark in there, job done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing too complicated. Mostly just brick-on-brick, but the sides of the car (which I can&#39;t call doors, even charitably) are built at 90 degrees to the rest. The sheer amount of red involved could potentially become confusing if built in a rush, but the model is small enough that mistakes are easily corrected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A very sexy car. Can&#39;t put it otherwise, this car looks pretty amazing. Its biggest downfall is the way it adheres to LEGO convention of only having one seat, which means that the whole thing is slightly too small, and too narrow in particular. In addition, the car has no functional doors, meaning the only way in or out is to physically remove the windscreen and drop into the cockpit. A shame, but the benefits of this system are plain to see - the car looks good from every angle, and no details are lost due to having single-piece doors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Even if cars and motor racing are not your thing I urge you to give this set a look. It fits a niche which has been almost entirely empty since LEGO&#39;s inception - that of semi-realistic, good-looking cars. Yes, it would be better as a two-seater, and yes, working doors would be welcome, but at this size and price point it&#39;d be difficult to do much better. Considering &pound;13 is the same price as a Star Wars battlepack where the model will be disassembled in days, the LaFerrari (and by extension the other Speed Champions cars) is a far better use of your pocket money.</p>

<p>Also consider that despite being marketed as a race car, the LaFerrari is also perfectly passable as a road car, albeit an exceedingly swish one even in Lego-town. It looks exceptionally good trundling down the street in front of a few modular buildings, something which can&#39;t be said of all the Speed Champions sets.</p>

I always find myself picking it up and driving on the floor. It includes a nicely detailed minifiure, a nice and sturdy light to start a race, and of course the car. The car has space for the figure to fit inside without any trouble of reaching for him. It it has moving tires allowing you to drive it. And exchangeable wheel hub caps for a different look. Over all i think it is a very nice set and would recommend it to any car fans Lego fans or fans of the speed champions theme.</p>
