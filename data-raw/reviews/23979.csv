"Gerbil","2015-08-01T17:55:38.073Z","Fun build, surprisingly disappointing final appearance.","<p>I bought this along with set #75908 as I loved the look of these cars. I chose this as I didn&#39;t want two red cars, and I prefer the yellow to grey of the remaining choice.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A great selection of pieces. Curves and SNOT brackets abound.</li>
	<li>Despite the size, contains a few interesting building techniques.</li>
	<li>Solid and weighty final model.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Stickers, that don&#39;t add very much. The headlights that wrap around the front are just ugly.</li>
	<li>The final model feels too tall. For some reason the dimensions just don&#39;t work compared to #75908</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I was disappointed. The shape of the model isn&#39;t clear from the box images, and it ends up looking too tall and not stream-lined enough. This is a problem unique to this model, as the other Speed Champions cars look just fine. For completists this is not a reason to not buy the model, but in hindsight I should have gone for one of the other cars in the series.</p>

It does 0-60 MPH in 2.7 seconds and 0-100 KM/H in 2.8 seconds, and brings a hefty 903 Horsepower to the plate. Needless to say, the car in real life is incredible, meaning LEGO had to show that in their design. In my opinion, they hit this one out of the park and did an amazing job. The sleekness and curves of the model are incredible, and there are only one or two complaints.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same size as for the other Speed Champion sets with one car (I don&#39;t know the dimensions). The front shows the normal statistics (piece count, set number, etc.) as well as a sleek picture set as it races down the track. On the back of the box, there are more pictures showing different views of the set, play features, and the car in real life. There is also a section detailing the real life stats of the car (the ones from the introduction).&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the instructions, there are two booklets which seemed weird for a set this size, and I never really figured out why. Other than this, the instructions were straight forward. The only other annoying thing was the instructions were folded, even though that is normal, it is always a bother.</p>

<p>The parts came in four bags, none of which were numbered. I&#39;m pretty sure this is normal for a set this size (168) pieces. Most of the parts were the yellowy-orange color that make up the majority of the car. My favorite part was the snowboard used on the back as a spoiler (I think this is also used in real life to help with the braking system but I&#39;m not sure. Included are two sets of hub caps (four of each), once having 10 spokes and the other having 5. Below are comparison pictures of the pieces&nbsp;alone, on the tires, and on the car. I prefer the 10 spoke&nbsp;piece because it is more faithful to the source material, also shown below.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure included is simple and sweet. He wears a white&nbsp;McLaren racing suit and silver helmet. The suit matches the car&#39;s colors with two vertical stripes on the right side and a red McLaren symbol on the left. On the back is the full McLaren name. He is equipped with a wrench like all other Speed Champions drivers (this is used to change the hub caps of the tires).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The build</span></h3>

<p>The build is very straight forward but uses many cool building techniques. Mainly the SNOT technique to capture the curves of the car.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is beautiful! I really feel the designers captured the full essence of the car and 90% of the curves. The remaining 10% is lost because the scale of the LEGO bricks and because of the headlights. The headlights look close to terrible in my opinion, but don&#39;t ruin the model completely. However, this is my only complaint, which keeps the model at 5/5 stars. Other than the ones on the headlights, I feel the stickers add a great sense of fluidness to the model, really bringing it to life. To show this, I first built it with out any stickers and took pictures. Then, once I added the stickers, I really appreciated that they were there.&nbsp;</p>

<span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Overall opinion</span></h3>

<p>Overall, I not only love the car in real life, but I also love the LEGO version. My only complaints are the way the headlights look, however I can&#39;t come up with a way to solve the problem, and the proportionality of the front area to the rest of the car. From some angles, the area forward of the front wheel looks perfect, yet from others it looks dreadfully long compared&nbsp;to the rest of the model. Despite me saying this, I can not think of a way to overcome this solution. Also, after Googling&nbsp;a picture of the car in real life, it seems as though this is how the real car looks.&nbsp;My favorite part is the spoiler on the back made from a snowboard (that really cracks me up)! I feel the minifigure is pretty cool too and nicely designed. To sum things up, I really love this model and give it 5/5 because of the playability, sleekness, and overall dynamics of the model.</p>

"KX","2017-12-27T13:17:36.877Z","Yay or Nay?","<p>This little set intrigued me, not because of the build, but because of the color.&nbsp; It was pleasing to see a black and yellow car.&nbsp; Kidding aside, I bought this set because of the 20% discount it had.</p>

<p><strong>PARTS</strong></p>

<p>I expected to see a lot of yellow and black pieces.&nbsp; However, imagine my surprise when I saw red, green, and blue pieces during the building process.&nbsp; While these pieces are hidden, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like it &ldquo;belonged&rdquo; in this set.&nbsp; Also, Speed Champions is not the theme for those who dislike applying stickers.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have the steadiest of hands so it took me quite a while to apply them.&nbsp; (BTW, shoutout to JANGBRICKS for his tutorial on how to apply stickers easily using a brick separator.&nbsp; Do check out his YouTube page)</p>

<p><strong>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m quite new on building these type of cars.&nbsp; I grew up building my Lego cars as simple as possible.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t the fast build I was expecting, but I had some good fun.&nbsp; The side build was meh.&nbsp; In my opinion, they shouldn&rsquo;t have added that as it wasn&rsquo;t worth the time.&nbsp; Probably it was put in there for decorative purposes or for play features.</p>

<p><strong>VALUE FOR MONEY</strong></p>

<p>In my country, this set is expensive.&nbsp; You need to have a discount so that it is worth it.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re a bit of a minifig collector like me, the body is exclusive.&nbsp; However, the price point of the set might deter you from buying one.&nbsp; You can just get the minifig from resellers or so if you want to.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL</strong></p>

<p>Display wise, it looks good.&nbsp; Not perfect but it&rsquo;s not bad.&nbsp; The appeal of these sets are in the building process and of course the car brand.&nbsp; I see collectors buying these sets because of the car brand or the overall looks.&nbsp; Sadly, this theme is not for everyone.&nbsp; While the set is ok, I don&rsquo;t see parents/AFOLs getting this one over a CITY or STAR WARS set.</p>
