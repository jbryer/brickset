<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box, like others in this theme, has the car manufacturer&#39;s logo on the front and details about the car on the back. It also shows the model and the minifigure in average detail.</p>

<p>The instructions are simple to follow and show the exact same details &nbsp;on the front as on the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The model contains various parts that are new for 2015 and the Speed Champions theme. These include the new wheel arch pieces which are designed to fit onto the car easily and also strengthen the car&nbsp;by attaching to more studs in the building process. The new windscreen piece is more suited to the car as it fits in with the overall shape of the car. It isn&#39;t printed, so it can be used in MOCs. The piece on which the car is built is a new one, as far as I can tell, and is also useful for MOCs such as cars and other vehicles that may need such a piece. The wheel cap things, I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re called, are also new for the theme and are new to this set in silver. The set comes with 2 designs which can be changed based upon what one would like the car to look like.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The minifigure in the set is new.&nbsp;The torso printing is exclusive and so are&nbsp;the legs, as far as I&#39;m concerned, &nbsp;whereas the head and helmet are both fairly common.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build isn&#39;t challenging and is therefore suitable for all ages. However this doesn&#39;t stop it from being interesting as the new pieces keep the builder engaged for the duration of the build, approximately 5-10 minutes depending on the age.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As I said in my introduction I know next to nothing about cars, so this section will be brief.</p>

<p>The car looks good.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is an excellent model and offers a lot to fans of lego whether you plan to display it or play with it. It comes with a great number of light grey pieces, a colour ideal for MOCs as it is in such great quantity amongst all themes. Thanks for spending time reading my review, it is my first one,&nbsp;and hopefully I shall write another soon.</p>

"lukethebrickdude","2015-11-29T12:42:15.11Z","A great replica of the Porsche 918 Spyder","<p>I&#39;ve never really been into the Racing genre, but when I saw this on LEGO&#39;s website, I just had to get it. City cars are too small and lacking in detail, but Creator cars are too large and have too many details for my city, so, when I saw the Speed Champions line, I thought they were amazing!</p>

<p>I picked up this set from Argos for &pound;12.99 and I built it up when I got home. For 153 pieces, just shy of &pound;13 isn&#39;t too bad. You get lots of exclusive pieces and stickers in this set, and the minifigure seems quite uncommon so I feel that this set is priced very appropriately.</p>

<p>The build was very fun and took around 15-20 minutes. I was very satisfied with the realism of the set. It has a good heft to it and feels quite aerodynamic and accurate to the real car.</p>

<p>I feel that the rear of the car could do with some slight improvement, but in a set with so many pros, one con is not enough to drag it down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually, just one car and a minifigure for &pound;13 would seem overpriced, but when the car is of this scale and this realism, it is hard to complain. If I had not seen the piece count, I would have discarded this set and complain it was overpriced. However, this is less than 10p per piece, so I&#39;m very happy with it!</p>

<p>So, should you buy this set? It depends on what you need. This set is definitely directed at car fans, but it should fall well into any LEGO layout. It depends whether you feel that it is needed. If you are looking to flesh out or populate your city, this probably isn&#39;t going to be the best fitting due to its complexity. However, if you&#39;re making a race track or something else, this set will be a great choice.</p>
