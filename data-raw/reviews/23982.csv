<p>The box was quite similar to that of the other speed champions&#39; sets. On the top corner it has the Porsche logo. On the back, all the action features of the set are shown along with some real car facts about the Porsche 911 RSR.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with a variety of parts, including alloy wheels, wheel arches, windscreens and orange slopes and wedges. The Speed Champions&#39; car parts are all new and very useful.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures<b>&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p>This set comes with four minifigures.</p>

<p>The <strong>race</strong> <strong>official</strong> is, in my opinion, the simplest out of the four, having black legs, a very common City torso that could be used (and has been used) for many different minifigures, and the new 2015 style of cap. The cap has a hole in the top to allow headphones/earmuffs to be attached. He also comes with a checkered flag.</p>

<p>The two <strong>Porsche racers </strong>are almost exactly alike, as only some colours differ between their racing suits. The driver in orange gets a Mobil 1 logo printed on his torso. They both come with dark-blue caps to wear after the race is over. I like the fact that the Porsche logo is printed on to their torsos as it makes them feel much more official and valuable!</p>

<p>The <strong>photographer</strong> is not an exclusive minifigure, however, the torso is quite rare, having the journalist/reporter printing. Otherwise, all her parts are quite common including her legs. She comes with what appears to be a DSLR camera.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very enjoyable with interesting builds for both the Porsches. The actual finish line and podium were not as exciting as the cars but were good builds, nonetheless. Many stickers were used but I end the end result justifies them.</p>

<h3>The completed model<b>&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p>I must say that the cars look absolutely superb! While not being completely accurate to their real-life counterparts, I think that they are well detailed and make great models. The racing podium is very compact,&nbsp;detailed and comes with a set of flag stickers!&nbsp;I could have done without the&nbsp;starting line, which has a neat feature of revealing each set of lights, but it does greatly increase the total&nbsp;playability of the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If I was to only buy one Speed Champions&#39; set from their first wave, I would&nbsp;have no doubt as this set is definitely my first choice. It has a great value for its price, has <strong>beautiful&nbsp;</strong>models and an excellent selection of new parts. This is a must buy, in my humble opinion, for anyone interested in Speed Champions and LEGO cars in general.</p>

<p>P.S. As for the ratings, a 3/5 is a average in my ratings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is around the same size as most sets at this price point as far as I&#39;m aware. It has the recommended age, set number and name on the left hand side and in the lower right corner, there is the Porsche logo. Along the top is the chequered flag Speed Champions branding and in the middle is a massive picture showing off all the contents of the set. The back has a whole load of images of features and some facts about the 911 RSR. There are three instruction manuals each with the same front cover, the image on the front of the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>According to this website, 551 in this set. Many are the same just in different colours thanks to their being two of roughly the same cars. A number of curved slopes and tiles in orange and white make up a lot of the parts, but there are a fair few tall pieces to hold up the start/ finish line and podium as well. New pieces: The wheel arches (6102590 and 6102583), the windscreens: (610258) and the wheel hubs: (6107393 and 6107392). They all are great pieces to own if you are moccing vehicles.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>four minifigs: The RSR driver: He has a nicely detailed white torso, with Porsche motorsport written across it in red and black letters. There are also Michelin and Mobil1<br />
badges above that. He has back printing which also says Porsche motorsport. His legs are white with a black waist, his helmet is red with a trans- clear visor and his head is smiling and has appeared before. The GT3 R driver: His torso is white with Porsche motorsport written on it in red and black letters, but has no other branding. The back also says Porsche motorsport. His arms are orange with black hands and his legs are also orange, with a dark grey waist. His helmet is blue with a trans- clear visor. His head is smiling, with a curvy smile, curvy eyebrows and some cheek and chin definition. I think I has appeared before, but its the first time I&#39;ve seen it.</p>

<p>The reporter has a red torso with a black shirt beneath a red stripy jacket with a press badge attached to it. It is very rare, to my knowledge. She has black legs with a black waist and brown hair which is the same mould and colour as used on Scarlet Witch from the hulk buster smash set. Her head is smiling, and isn&#39;t really rare. She comes with a camera with a very long lens. The track marshal has a common torso, a blue jacket with pockets and orange stripes. He has black legs with a black waist and his head has sunglasses on. I think it has appeared before. He also has a red cap with the hole in the top for attaching headphones. He holds a small chequered flag.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build isn&#39;t too complex and making the cars doesn&#39;t feel awfully repetitive. I think they felt different enough to keep my interest. It is always good seeing the cars come together, and that was no different here. It was nice to build the mechanism for the start lights on the finish line and the podium was fun to build because it is so detailed. But, it did get frustrating, and sort of ruined the build, when I had to put on the 48 stickers. I&#39;m no sticker hater, but when you&#39;re trying to complete the cars and it takes fifteen attempts to get each one right, it gets on your nerves. I advise you to put them all on after you&#39;ve finished.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finish line: It is a good little build. Its realistic, tall enough and wide enough to easily fit both cars, and the lights function looks good and works well. The podium: Very large, nice and solid, a lot of detail and just looks RIGHT. It comes with a full set of tools, a little garage and a spare wheel. It is nicely shaped, and the barrier looks great. The interchangeable flags system is a nice touch too. The cars: They are both nice, and realistic too. The stickers are a pain to apply but look good. I like the GT3 R hybrid better because I like the colour scheme more and it has a few different pieces used on the front, and I think it makes it look better. They have hardly any studs showing, giving a nice smooth look to both and the backs of both have as much detail as the front. I especially like the exhausts! The cars are nice and solid too, so aren&#39;t going to break in the hands of kids. Also, on a side note, if you take the wing of the RSR, (the white one) then the rear of it looks like the rear of a Felino&nbsp;CB7! (feel free to google that!)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set. It is really good. The podium and finish line don&#39;t just feel like accessories to the cars, which is what things like this usually feel like, because they are good builds. The cars are great looking and I think they are as realistic as they could have got them. I certainly think that they are easily recognisable! So, if you&#39;re a car fan, this is a must have, and if you&#39;re not, then it is still a worthy purchase. it has 551 parts and is &pound;40 in the UK. That equates to 7.3p per part. In the U.S. It is $50 which comes to 9.1c per piece. So, a great set for a great price. I think it&#39;s definitely worth it.</p>
