<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was hugely impressive, with great posed photos of the set and information on the real car upon which it is based. The instruction booklets are fairly standard, with good print quality.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of panel parts make up the trailer, so the number of parts used - nearly 900 - is even more impressive. A lot of parts go into the truck and car, although there are no real stand out parts in this set. Well, maybe the scooter as I have never had one before but this is not the first time it has been used in a set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>6 minifigures, 6! Their prints are all great and each has a clear role. It is nice that 2 drivers are included, so when you switch the front wing out and change the car number you can swap the drivers to suit (Kimi or Fernando). I appreciate that extra effort.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly standard - some more advanced techniques in the truck section keep things interesting. The rear loading ramps of the trailer and very effective and the method of building them is also quite interesting.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Wow! I had no appreciation for the size of this model until I built it. It&#39;s huge! The accessories included along with the spare wheels and front wing mean there is plenty of play value. It looks very impressive, and the F1 car also has a pin in the correct position meaning it can be launched from the Pit Stop set (75911). The roof of the truck section comes away a little too easily though when driving the truck around, although replacing some jumper plates with standard studded plates fixes this. The wheel base is long, and the tyres seem extra grippy&nbsp;so it doesn&#39;t turn very well on wooden floors though.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Fantastic set and very detailed. Sticker usage is quite high, but most Speed Champion sets do rely on stickers for their looks. This is acceptable given the subject matter though as race cars do tend to have a lot of livery details. For a licenced product you do pay a little extra, but the parts included are useful and varied so this will make a good donor parts set as well.</p>

<p>Ten years later Lego releases an updated version of the 8654 Ferrari truck from 2005 Racers theme repeating and actualizing the same winning concept.</p>

<p>There are many similarities between the two models but even some little substantial differences. While you can see how the proportions of both trucks and cars are very close, you can even see how, if the first truck was mainly oriented only to transporting, the new one seems a middle way between a transport truck and a box\motor-home. In fact, aside from all the outfit and spare parts you can expect from a set like this, you can see also computers and a detailed map of the track, all elements who suggest the idea of a certain box activity, and atmosphere. Of course someone could consider this choice not to be very realistic, but personally I consider it very good, because it brings a certain life and playability into a trailer whose only purpose would be only load and unload material. The lack of pit lane and box complementary sets like it was for the previous Ferrari Racers theme make of this Ferrari truck a little unlikely but at the same time very imaginative and appreciable set.</p>

<p>The Ferrari car is simple but very similar to its real counterpart, it really captures the essential points of the real F14-T and of its front wing. Like the truck, it is oriented to playability with the choice of a wedge plate 4x3 instead of a 4x4 like in the older Lego Ferrari F1: they don&#39;t close the cockpit and don&#39;t look well but in exchange make definitely easier to place the minifigures inside and outside of the car. Fun are also the detachable front wings, which come in two different types.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a lot of fun, for sure, I enjoyed very much building this set, the build itself it is not repetitive. I appreciated the care for details, the truck with its trailer is huge, bigger than any other Lego truck but at the same time solid, granitic, very well designed. I easily suggest it to everyone who is interested in racing themes, and if you are enough lucky to get one of these don&#39;t forget the 75911 McLaren Pit Stop, both these sets complement each other in a perfect way.</p>
