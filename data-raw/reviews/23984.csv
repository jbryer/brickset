<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Plas comes in a polybag, just like most other promotional figures. You can see his side leg printing, which I believe is a first for DC Superheroes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>4 parts.&nbsp; The hair is the same as Superman, the head depicts sunglasses and a grin, the body has both front and back printing, and the legs have side leg printing, which, like I said, I believe is a first for DC minifigs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Or, in this case, minifigure. Plastic Man is absolutely phenomenal when put together. There&#39;s a lot of detail, but it&#39;s the right amount. He has the same amount of poseability as all other LEGO minifigs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Snap the 4 parts together, ta-da!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>See &quot;Minifigures&quot;.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend this figure to anyone who is a DC fan. It&#39;s an absolutely phenomenal figure with a perfect amount of detail, unlike other recent figures (for example, Luke Skywalker from the Sandcrawler, Cantina, or 2014 Advent Calendar). He fits in perfectly next to other DC figs, like Flash or Aquaman. If you can get him for $15 or less, it&#39;s a steal.</p>
