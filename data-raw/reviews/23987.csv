"LegoHPnut","2014-12-30T01:57:44.66Z","Not the Worst Idea Ever","<p>I was sold on this set as soon as it was announced. 5 main characters from the Lego Movie? Check. The double-decker couch? Check. Only FIFTEEN US dollars? Amazing. Read on to see just why I love this set so.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All five of these figures are extremely on point. Emmet&#39;s head is double-sided, one side featuring his trademark smile and the other having a look of deep concern. Oh, and he&#39;s holding the first-ever LEGO waffle. Pretty cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unikitty is sitting down for the first time, and comes with two heads: crying and what I&#39;m gonna call inquisitive. She&#39;s made out of fewer pieces than regular Unikitty, but that&#39;s expected.</p>

<p>President Business has two expressions: Happy and confused. His suit is buttoned up and great for a generic businessman suit.</p>

<p>Ghost Vitruvius is amazing, as expected. His staff is made of three parts, but the best things are his ghost &quot;suit&quot; featuring his headband molded on the top, his solid white torso and printed 1x2x2 brick used as legs.</p>

<p>My absolute favorite figure in this set is Benny, who was previously only available in Benny&#39;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!!!!! and Metalbeard&#39;s Sea Cow&nbsp;is much appreciated in this value-priced set. His two expressions are happy and overjoyed.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is relatively simple. Both models in this set were previously available, the car being a free model build at Toys R Us and the couch coming from Metalbeard&#39;s&nbsp;Sea Cow. So far as I can tell, the car only has two differences: a trans-red 1x2 plate on the front under the bumper instead of a light grey one, and an extra 1x2 wall element&nbsp;in the back. The couch is identical to the one in the Sea Cow. Both are relatively simple to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Both models are small, but again they&#39;re screen-accurate to the movie. Combine that with the stellar figure line-up, and you&#39;ve got one of the best value sets ever produced by LEGO. Bravo.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This set still seems too good to be true. The model is completely screen-accurate, the minifigure selection is phenomenal and the price is only $15?! I can&#39;t recommend it enough.</span></p>

"krklint","2014-12-30T03:38:25.683Z","Double-Decker Couch - it's all about the minifigures","<p>Is the double-decker couch the same build as the couch found in MetalBeard&#39;s Sea Cow? Yes. Has the car in this set appeared a few times before? Yes. Should you still buy multiples of this set, ABSOLUTELY!<br />
<br />
At the price this set is being sold at, everyone who loves the Lego Movie can now have nearly every main minifigure (Yarr, where be m&#39; Wyldstyle in this here set?) at an affordable price. Also, the slight variations in the faces of the minfigures will enhance the abilities of any stop motion videographers. Also, those worried about the aftermarket price of Benny the Spaceman being destroyed by an asteroid can relax, for this is not the exact same Benny.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box = Small and easily portable.</p>

<p>Instructions = 36 pages: 31 pages of instruction, 4 pages of advertisement, 1 page for parts list.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Before a closer conversation about the minifigures, here are some of the highlights about the parts in general. This set contains 209 total parts. 197 pieces for the build, with 11 extra pieces (2 of which are Uni-Kitty&#39;s alternate face and 1 of which is an extra light-blue unicorn horn). Those who build MetalBeard&#39;s Sea Cow will already know that most of the parts for the double-decker couch are small and found in multiples of 1-4 of each piece. The main exceptions to this piece count are:</p>

<p>A) <font size=""+0"">20 X Part 4581225 (Bricklink #63868) </font><font class=""fv""><font face=""Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"" size=""+0"">Plate, Modified 1 x 2 with Clip Horizontal on End</font></font> in dark blue gray. Outside of MetalBeard&#39;s Sea Cow, this piece has only been offered at a higher piece-count, in dark blue gray, once before. That time it was offered in 2013&#39;s USC <font face=""Tahoma,Arial"" size=""2"">Red Five X-wing Starfighter - UCS</font> (set number10240).</p>

<p>B) 12 X Part 4528357 (Bricklink #3068B) <font face=""Geneva,Arial,Helvetica"" size=""+0"">Medium Blue&nbsp;Tile 2 x 2 with Groove</font> in medium blue. 25 sets have offered this piece in medium blue before, yet most of those sets are high dollar sets, out of many people&#39;s price range, such as the Grand Emporium, the Simpson&#39;s House, and the Heartlake Shopping Mall. Honestly, the inclusion of this part (and the next one listed) in larger quantities should make many MOCers very happy!</p>

<p>C) 20 X Part 4168345 (Bricklink #3069B) Tile 1 x 2 with Groove&nbsp; in medium blue. Ok, this piece has shown up in this color 46 times before, but this is only the 6th time that this piece arrives in medium blue, in a set, at a count of more than 10. For anyone attempting to piece together some classic sets from recent years, you&#39;ll only need to buy two of the double-decker couch to fulfill the medium blue 1x2 tile count required for the Green Grocer or the Taj Mahal.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Centerpiece of this set! Lets be honest, the five minifigures ARE the reason this set will sell, and it should be. Now, if Lego had just placed the same minifigures in this set, without any variations to them, the Bricklink market would crash, the resellers would riot, and way too many $100+ sets would end up locked away in closets for years to come. Though some of us might cheer such events on, really great variations within these minifgures are found in this set.<br />
<br />
<strong>With that said, what are the slight variations within these minifigures</strong>?<br />
<br />
<strong>Benny the 1980&#39;s Space Man</strong> = Benny&#39;s smile is reversed! If you want to recreate the stop-motion scene in the movie when Benny finally gets to build a Spaceship Spaceship Spaceship, you can. In this version, Benny&#39;s eyes are also squinting, whereas they are open in the first Benny offering.<br />
<br />
The original Benny and this Benny both have a head with a second printing. On the original Benny, the reverse face had two eyes and a smile. On this version&#39;s reverse expression, eyebrows are added, and the eyes are only 5/6th complete, with a small portion missing at the bottom of the eyes. This slight change to the classic smiling face gives off a sense that Benny could be sincerely blushing.</p>

<p><strong>Uni-Kitty in Pink X2! </strong>That&#39;s right, UniKitty arrives in this set with two unique faces, and they each face is printed on its own 1x3 brick. Now we have been given Astro-Kitty in blue, Angry Kitty in firey red, Queasy Kitty in queasy-sea green, and UniKitty and Biznik Kitty in Bright Pink.<br />
<br />
In this set we again receive UniKitty in the main UniKitty color of Bright Pink. The tail is the same as the original pink kitten, but outside of the face, the main difference between this version of Unikitty and the one&#39;s listed above is that the body of this Unikitty does not consist of a 1X3 arch brick. Instead, this Unikitty is sitting down, with a 1x2 bright pink&nbsp; sloped brick for the body.<br />
<br />
Now, as cool as a sitting kitty is, it is the face of Unikitty that will excite people.&nbsp; Afterall, UniKitty is about everything except unhappy things, and until now only about 200 people lucky enough to receive the San Diego comic-con version of UniKitty, which contained Cheerful Kitty face and Cutesy Kitty face, were able to change her bright pink complexion... and at those numbers, unhappy faces started to appear.<br />
<br />
To settle Unikitty down, along with a riotous group of online comic-con commentors, the double-decker couch set offers a concerned Unikitty face and a &quot;wobbly&quot; Unikitty face. Again, great for stop motion. Like the San Diego comic-con version, but unlike the original UniKitty version in bright pink, these two faces are made up of two pieces each. Each face contains a 1X3 brick, where the nose, mouth, and eyes are printed. The other piece, a 1x3 plate, comes with two small arcs printed on. These arcs are UniKitty&#39;s eyebrows! Two pieces have eyebrow printing, and they are unique from each other and the comic-con exclusive. The comicon eyebrow piece had two eyebrows that both curved upward. Here, UniKitty&#39;s eyebrows curve opposite directions, with one piece having the left eyebrow up/right eyebrow down, while the second piece has the left eyebrow down/right eyebrow up. I personally cannot wait to see how these &quot;eyebrow&quot; pieces begin to show up in MOC&#39;s in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>President Business can smile?</strong> He can, he can smile! A possible hint to the next movie (personal guess), people commented pre-release that this set has an odd mix of minifigures. After all, President Business and&nbsp; Ghost Virtruvious never visited Emmit&#39;s double-decker couch; but as this set is delivered nearly a year after the movie was released, maybe the Lego Group is leading us all slowly to the second movie? Though speculation, one does not need to speculate that President Business found his kinder smile near the end of the movie.<br />
<br />
Again, the facial printing is what is unique here. He arrives again wearing a dark bluish gray suit. He has had the suit unbottoned and buttoned before, and in this version his suit is buttoned.<br />
<br />
His unibrow can be found printed on both sides of the head. The least exciting face is one of slight doubt. The eyes are round with white pupils and a tiny concerned frown. This face plays well with the face seen late in the movie, as does the other face on this minifigure. On the main face, the unibrow plays large with the same eyes found on the other side, but the tiny frown is replaced with a large upon-mouthed grin. Anyone into MOCing might find this expression worthy of joining a choir of singing minifigures. I personally will be adding this face to my holiday village carolers.</p>

<p><strong>Emmet in Construction Outfit...</strong> again. What can I say, he is the Special, but this minifigure proves that those who are special really do appear in the same outfit many times over. Lego could have gone outside of the plans on this one, but the plans were followed, and the torso and legs are the same as the other construction Emmets.<br />
<br />
Two faces appear, with one being an exact replica or very nearly exact replica of the open lopsided smile face found on the CMF version of Emmet. The second face shows a concerned face, with a downward-turned smile and slight forehead wrinkles between the eyebrows. He does come with a printed 2x2 waffle cookie, so that is nice. He also comes with a hair piece and a hard hat, so you can offer Emmet in two variations. Unfortunately, the hard hat is not the version with hair showing below it, but is just a classic red hard hat.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ghost Vitruvius!!!</strong>&nbsp; As unexciting as Emmet is, Ghost Vitruvius is the opposite. Vitruvius himself is oddly rare within the Lego sets. One version appeared in a rare promotional set, another version appeared with a copy of the first movie, and a third version appeared in two of the Lego Movie sets, but a Ghost Vitruvius had not appeared (to my knowledge) until now.<br />
<br />
So, what does this wondrous spirit consist of? His torso is all white with white hands. This lack of color or printing makes sense, as his ghost head covers 2/3rds of his body, just like the classic ghost figures have always done. A side effect of this body length is that the back of the head kind of resembles flowing white hair, if you have a child&#39;s imagination.<br />
<br />
Also, like many of the ghost bodies, Ghost Vitruvius glows in the dark! As seen in ghosts from other sets, the ability to glow may change in future versions, but for now, he glows in the dark!. Different from other ghost bodies, but found on all versions of Vitruvius, is a tan headband on the ghost. Honestly, he is/was a Master Builder, so he does deserve a mark of uniqueness, and this headband/halo certainly does accomplish the task.</p>

<p>Now, this minifigure comes with a cape. The cape fits over the torso and under the body-length head.The cape is slightly longer than the head in back, and is printed on one side with silver dots - which offer a magical effect to the minifigure.<br />
<br />
The piece used for the legs will be used by some MOCers (this person included) for window curtains. The piece is a white 1x2x2 printed brick. It has 7 gray lines running vertically up one side. Each line ends at a horizontal black line, and under the line are 8 small fringe/rope balls. As I am not an interior decorator, I&#39;m lost for a better way to describe them. In the end, though, I&#39;ve seen such decorative balls found on lamp shades, fancy outfits, and curtains... and I know this piece will work well in MOCs for some people.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite simple and straight-forward. It is a complete duplication of the double-decker couch found in the MetalBeard&#39;s Sea Cow set. To paraphrase Vitruvius, It is truly the most unremarkable build you&#39;ll ever come across.<br />
<br />
The car is quite similar. Seen before, done before, and very basic.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is repetitious of past builds. The joy of this set, though, is that when it folds down on the hinges, it actually has some zoomability to it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For those who loved the movie, and want a set that can quickly become a starter set for this theme, the minifigures found here make this set a major first purchase. For those who love ghosts, kittens, classic space, construction, and businessmen, this set gives everyone options; and at it&#39;s price point, it allows everyone to gain wonderful main characters without having to break the Lego piggy bank to do so. Overall, this set is one to fall in love with!<br />
<br />
On a longterm purchase, this set is a MOCers dream. The parts within this set may not stay as a double-decker couch, but all 209 parts will easily be used in future non-licensed builds, and rarely can one say that about a set of any size.<br />
<br />

"darthdc","2015-02-10T18:21:09.283Z","Introducing... the best TLM figure set ever!","<p>Emmet&#39;s&nbsp;notoriusly dumb idea has been reintroduced as basically, the best value set for the LEGO Movie range. With the exception of a few promo polybags and the CMF set, this is the first boxed set from the range that I&#39;ve bought, and for 5 very good reasons: the figures.</p>

<p>So, the set consists of the Double-Decker Couch (only previously available with Metalbeard&#39;s Sea Cow) and Emmet&#39;s Car (previously available as a promo set). Then come the jewels of the set: the figures.</p>

<p>Of the figures, its Ghost Vitruvius who stands out as the pick of the set. Never available until now, this hoped for figure doesn&#39;t disappoint. Complete with a unique ghost &quot;sheet&quot; piece, that has a headband moulded to it. His torso is completely white and unadorned, though with the ghost piece in place, it matters not. The only adorned brick is the 1x2x2 white brick with &quot;robe&quot; decoration. He also comes with the crude &quot;chewed lollipop&quot; staff, and the patterned cape that comes with all other versions of him.</p>

<p>Benny is a great addition, since he has only been made available in larger, more expensive sets, until now. His head comes with 2 expressions: a slightly embarrassed smile, and a more cheerful laughing&nbsp;grin. He comes with a red sausage to munch on.</p>

<p>Emmet is the least exciting figure. He comes in his construction worker uniform, which has been released with almost every version of him. His two faces are the slanted grin expression seen on his CMF incarnation, and a more worried concerned look. He comes with a waffle 2x2 round tile and his builders helmet (which is more useless than the Double-Decker Couch, due to his head having two faces).</p>

<p>President Business has only been available in the CMF range, which saw him with two angry expressions. This time, he has a cheerful smiling expression (end of movie) and a confused look (similar to the one he uses when Emmet shows him his &quot;secret weapon&quot;). He&#39;s the only minifigure in the set without a specific accessory.</p>

<p>The final figure is Unikitty, who is presented here, in her usual pink/pastel colours, with a new sitting torso (she appears like this on the submarine, when Emmet offers to talk with her about her sorrows). She also comes with two expressions, albeit on different pieces. The first is a confused look, while the second is a sorrowful doe-eyed look with tears welling up underneath - she is trying to stay composed at the sight of a destroyed Cloud&nbsp;Cuckoo Land.</p>

<p>The Double-Decker Couch is very much as it appears in the film, and does hold together well. The ladders on either side do bulge out slightly at the top, but all in all, a decent build. Benny has to sit on it at an angle, due to his oxygen tanks, but thats the only gripe. With a few extra plates added, you could easily sit 3 figures on each section.</p>

<p>Emmet&#39;s Car. Not a bad little addition to the set, and it has some nice features, such as wing mirrors and a radio on the dashboard (just so Emmet can listen to THAT song again, over and over). Emmet barely fits in though, with his head practically touching the ceiling.</p>

<p>Above all, this set is well worth the &pound;15 I paid for it. You&#39;re getting 2 figures that are unique, and 1 that is only available in very expensive sets. Expect dealers to be asking for quadruple the RRP on the figures alone.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-10-25T19:49:52.73Z","A Bedevilled Land-Couch!","<p><strong>Set #70818 Double-Decker Couch: </strong>The Double-Decker Couch is really popular amongst fans of this movie, so popular in-fact that you not only get to build it in MetalBeard&rsquo;s Sea Cow, but LEGO decided to include it in its very own set. And this set is definitely much better than the previous set reviewed. Read on to find out my thoughts.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: Again not much to add here, I do like this box over the Batman &amp; Super Angry Kitty set, because it shows off the set much better and looks nicer compared to the more generic image of the set from the B&amp;SAK one.</p>

<p>Instructions: This features many more cross-promotional images, but still no Minifigure checklists. The steps for the build are straight-forward and not too difficult, there are also no stickers in this set which is nice.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Again there aren&rsquo;t a lot of parts in this set and none that rare. The blue tiles and plates of the couch may be useful for MOC fans, since it is a nice shade of blue somewhat reminiscent of Homer Simpsons&rsquo; pants colour. Other than those pieces, not much else useful.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>You get four Minifigures in this set and one buildable character, and she&rsquo;s such an adorable one too.</p>

<p>Benny: This is an awesome cheap method of getting Benny for your Movie Minifigure collection. He&rsquo;s an awesome throwback to the past of LEGO being a classic blue spaceman. His helmet is sculpted to reflect the fact that many Classic Space helmets over time have been known to crack at the chin guard. He has two facial expressions, one a happy smile the other I am not certain what it is precisely, it looks happy, but it could be on the verge of tears after seeing a sad movie with a happy ending. He has no accessories aside from his blue oxygen tanks.</p>

<p>Emmet: The Special is back, enjoying spending time with his friends on his Double-Decker Couch. And he&rsquo;s pretty much the same Emmet we&rsquo;ve seen in hundreds of sets. The only difference in his prints is the double-sided face which has him smiling, or sad. He has a hot dog as an accessory, as well as a construction worker&rsquo;s helmet, which sadly cannot fit on his head while he has his typical hairpiece on it.</p>

<p>President Business: The same torso and legs are found in this set for President Business. However his expressions are from the end of the movie, meaning he&rsquo;s now a happy and better adjusted person. One side of his face has an expression that kind of looks like his confused expression from the end of the movie when Emmet hands him the Kraggle lid. The other is smiling and happy as he enjoys time with his new friends. He gets a printed round tile with a waffle print. The best piece in this set for people looking for waffles for their LEGO collections.</p>

<p>Ghost Vitruvius: The utmost awesomest of awesome Minifigures from this set is Vitruvius as a ghost. Seriously this is just hilarious. Not only do you get a unique printed 1x2 brick with Vitruvius&rsquo; robe for the legs, but the glow-in-the-dark ghost piece has been newly sculpted to accommodate his headband. He also gets to wear the cape and carry the staff, just like in the movie. This is one seriously fun Minifigure and having it in such a easily accessible set is icing on the cake.</p>

<p>Unikitty: She&rsquo;s the most adorablest buildable version yet. She&rsquo;s built in her sitting position, with her tail wrapped around her back leg, and her face is wide-eyed and mystified or confused. The best part though is you get a second face that is almost on the verge of tears, as she looked when Cloud Cuckoo Land was destroyed. It&rsquo;s so heart-wrenching and cute all at the same time.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build for this set is for two models, the Double-Decker Couch and Emmet&rsquo;s Car, both of these builds are fairly straight-forward and don&rsquo;t take very long. The couch can be a tad repetitive, but it&rsquo;s still fairly satisfying and true to the on-screen model we saw.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Emmet&rsquo;s Car: An awesome little build which we&rsquo;ve seen before. In fact this model is very reminiscent of one found in LEGO City a few years ago, it is also the same model seen in a Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us build event during the month of February when the movie first came out last year. It&rsquo;s a great model and I&rsquo;m a big fan of it.</p>

<p>Double-Decker Couch: This model is really fun, it can&rsquo;t open the seats to hide in like the one from the film, and it seems to have a minor issue with the ladders leading to upper seating area not aligning 100% vertically due to design, but it captures the look of the model from the film. It&rsquo;s great, though there isn&rsquo;t much else to say about it, except you get four white mugs with the model. Oh yes, Benny doesn&rsquo;t sit too well on it, due to the nature of his character. The oxygen tank won&rsquo;t let him sit flush with his back against the couch.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a really great set, it has five characters that are all brilliant and the two models compliment each other nicely. There are no play features, no flick-fire missiles, no micromanagers, but that&rsquo;s not a bad thing. The simplicity of the model and the fact that you can get Benny for less than 20$ is a real treat. I strongly recommend it, I mean Unikitty alone is worth the price with her adorable facial expressions, and Ghost Vitruvius, he&rsquo;s awesome. Again, strongly recommended.</p>

"HarleyMeenen","2016-09-04T04:20:20.88Z","Cute But Not Much Else","<p>I was super excited for this set, as I love the idea of the double-decker couch. And there is a lot to love. There is a good range of minifigures, with two expressions for everyone but Vitruvius, who is quite fun with a ghost piece fitting over his body and a cape with a nice design.</p>

<p>The build, unfortunately, is a bit underwhelming. It&#39;s a small set, so a quick build is to be expected. However, it is quite repetitive, with the two sections of the couch being nearly identical and not all that much difference between the seat and back portions of each.</p>

<p>I like the look of the completed set, though it doesn&#39;t seem particularly stable. It&#39;s a fun little scene, and a good value for the price. I would absolutely recommend it to fans of The Lego Movie who are looking for a quick, cheap set, but I probably wouldn&#39;t put it as a must-have.</p>

"covfefe2020","2020-05-04T19:30:49.447Z","Good fun","<p>The double decker couch was probably the funniest part of the Lego Movie and it was implemented very well into true lego form. Its stable and fun to construct.&nbsp; Emmet&acute;s car is also well-designed but there isn&#39;t much to say about it. Onto the mini figures.&nbsp; Benny&acute;s faces are really great, I enjoy his open mouth. Unikitty&acute;s arent so appealing to me as I dont have any other versions of the figure with normal faces and eyebrows, but someone who does have it will probably appreciate. Emmet is fine, nice that he comes with a hard hat and waffles. President Business is well with good faces. Ghost Vitruvius is what steals the show here, with a glow in the dark classic looking ghost peice, shiny cape, and candy staff (it is better to use an actual used sucker as his accessory). He uses a 1x2 Printed brick instead of legs but it stays stable.</p>
",TRUE,4,5,5,3,4
"Studded_Dud","2020-07-24T18:15:24.223Z","Worth Every Penny","<p>Building Experience: The building experience itself is not anything special and is a bit repeated but the reward is worth it. Emmet&#39;s car looks just as it does in the movie which is exactly what should be expected. The double-decker couch also looks just like the movie. The couch has four cup holders and four spots for minifigures to sit. It is a little hard to sit Benny down because he has his oxygen tank on his back.</p>

<p>Parts: 197 parts is a lot of pieces for a set this size, but I will get into that more with the value. There are some decent pieces that are helpful. There is a printed radio tile inside of Emmet&#39;s car that fits in perfectly. There are four white cups one for each minifigure with hands, there is also a waffle, sausage, and Emmet&#39;s extra hard hat which fits into the back of his car. The two latter pieces that lead up to the top of the couch are great as is the color of the couch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability: The playability with this set is endless. Creating adventures is easy with the five minifigures provided along with Emmet&#39;s car and the legendary double-decker couch.</p>

<p>Value for Money: This set is well worth the price you pay. At&nbsp;&pound;14.99 / $14.99 getting 197 pieces is rare. There are also no stickers with this set and it includes a few printed pieces. The couch is also bigger&nbsp;than the pictures may make it seem which is another upside of how great this set&#39;s value is.</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set includes five minifigures which are all unique to this set. Emmet has his regular construction worker outfit along with his customary hair. He has a double-sided head one side is happy and the other side looks a bit concerned. He also comes with an extra hard hat. Unikitty in this set is sitting down but includes two head for different expressions. The first head makes her look a bit confused, as the second head makes her sad. Benny is in his regular battered up space gear. He also has a double-sided head that shows him ecstatic on one side and on the other he looks&nbsp;a mix of sad and happy. President Business&nbsp;is&nbsp;in his suit with his custom blocky hair. He, too, has a double-sided head that makes him look happy or confused. After Vitruvius&#39;s heart wrenching death in the movie, he reappears later as a ghost which is how he appears in this set. His ghost head has a rubber band around his head just like the movie. He includes a cape and printed feet.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall this is an extraordinary set that is worth every penny spent. With five unique minifigures and three of which have a double-sided face the playability is endless. the piece count and the look of the set both top of making the price of&nbsp;&pound;14.99 / $14.99 perfect for this small little set.</p>

"Chrinchy","2020-06-17T16:32:30.6Z","Does Some Things Good but Others Not So Much","<p>A fun little set from The Lego Movie, while there are some things that are A+ in my opinion there are also some things that they failed at a bit too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience:</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun putting the characters together&nbsp;and&nbsp;assembling the car too. The couch itself seemed basic, but they made it a little more complicated in my opinion and seemed a bit of overkill; however they might have wanted it to stay up right and not become top heavy if the bottom wasn&#39;t attached to anything. All in all it took me 10 minutes maybe to assemble everything and set it up.</p>

<p>The other problem is the 2 ladders on the side don&#39;t sit straight up and only attach to the bottom couch. I don&#39;t know why they decided to design it that way, but I really believe they should have made the ladders snap on both the top and bottom, so it sits flush&nbsp;and straight instead of having a bit of a lean to it and makes you think you assembled it wrong.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>This is where the set really shines in my opinion and probably the best part of the entire set. I&#39;m not talking about each individual piece but you get a lot of unique pieces and good variety of pieces from different sets all over the Lego universe. You get a 1980s astronaut, a ghost from the old medievals&nbsp;sets, a construction worker, a small car with wheels, doors that open, a couple other accessories like cups, waffle, hot dog, a staff, and the couch has some brown ladders. All in all you get 5 of the main cast in this set which is fantastic and unexpected so a welcome bonus.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>As a kid, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s great to play with, but on its own it leaves a lot to be desired. With six figures you can have lots of play time with it and the car can make for some adventures...but honestly the purpose was for them to sit on a double decker couch and that&#39;s all it is really made for. The couch itself is nice, but there isn&#39;t much room for all of them to sit on there and not all the couch sections have&nbsp;spots for the lego characters to snap on too, so some end up sliding which makes the couch look more like a couch but less like a lego couch.</p>

<p>Value For Money:</p>

<p>Buying this set now might not be worth the price, but at the time you get a lot of value in terms of unique pieces and characters from the movie.It&#39;s a great piece to finish a collection or to collect a small piece of the movie, but if you&#39;re looking for a set that will give you hours of playtime you will have to look somewhere else.</p>
