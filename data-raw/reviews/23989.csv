"AddictedToStyrene","2015-06-02T02:02:44.133Z","Great set for family play","<p>This is a brilliant little set because it adds a mother and baby for little ones to play with. If your child has a tub of general Duplo (like ours do) this lets them build a house or park, and then roleplay the parents and babies who play there. (we also have truck driver and zookeeper figures, so we have daddy and grandparent figures when we want them).</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The set comes in a plastic wrapper, with a folded sheet &#39;mini catalogue&#39;. The packaging shows alternative builds, even for a tiny set like this. Something you don&#39;t see on regular kids&#39; Lego sets!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Nice part selection to add to a Duplo collection. The stroller and milk bottle add to the play, the chairs are very nice and can be used by &#39;adult&#39; and &#39;child&#39; Duplo figures.&nbsp;The set has&nbsp;a small variety of bricks to make a tree and flowers. There is also a milk bottle which can be gripped by a Duplo figure, as can the handlebar of the stroller. My child likes to have the mother hold the stroller with one hand, the bottle in her other hand, the baby in the stroller, and a Duplo child figure holding the stroller as well - just like when we take the baby and the big kid out for a walk in real life. This shows how kids want to roleplay what they know, with their toys.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The mother figure is a standard Duplo figure, with blue legs (&#39;mom jeans&#39;) and a printed sweater. The baby is moulded in two shades of yellow; it is smaller than other Duplo figures and is not poseable, nor can the hands grip anything. The baby can sit inside the stroller without connecting, or it can connect by &#39;standing&#39; on its two feet. It can also connect to standard Duplo bricks,&nbsp;so it will be stable sitting on a chair or any two studs on a brick. The baby&#39;s face is decorated with a dummy.&nbsp;The stroller is&nbsp;a bit wider than the spaces between Duplo studs, so it won&#39;t slide naturally along a Duplo baseplate like a train on tracks, but that doesn&#39;t detract from the set. The stroller has&nbsp;a single stud inside it, but the interior is smaller than a square 2 x 2 Duplo brick, so it is hard to build something unusual out of it. Flower pieces and smaller round pieces (like the milk bottle or a 2 x 2 cylinder) will fit inside, though.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Even though there are only a handful of bricks in this set, there are alternative builds! The chairs can be set on a flat plate, with a flower and a tree (made of curved green bricks on a brown square brick), or the flat plate can go on a square brick to make a simple table. Not exactly advanced techniques but perfect inspiration for three-year-olds for their own furniture ideas.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>No surprises: mother, baby, stroller and furniture. There&#39;s not a lot in the package, but it&#39;s a great&nbsp;set to help turn a Duplo building into a home for a family.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Brilliant. Buy this so your little Lego fan can play families with Duplo.</p>
