"alfred_the_buttler","2018-10-13T07:57:49.473Z","One of our favorite Duplo sets","<p>My son has graduated from Duplos to regular Legos now, but back in his Duplo days this set was one of, if not his absolute favorite.&nbsp; It was the one set we kept in his room and didn&#39;t mix up&nbsp;with other sets.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because it had an airplane.</p>

<p>At first my son could not assemble the airplane on his own.&nbsp; Then he would always put the wings on backwards.&nbsp; Finally as he got older he figured it out.&nbsp; But putting the three minifigures&nbsp;into the plane along with the suitcases (which we filled with cut up paper that we called money) allowed him to fly anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>The truck and the terminal were never too exciting, but I taught him how he could use the 1x2x2&nbsp;bricks as part of the airplane construction to make the plane larger and that became a lot of fun for him.</p>

<p>This set provided us with several years of fun and it is sad to see that it is now ignored for his &quot;little Legos&quot;.&nbsp; But that of course is the point of Duplos, to get outgrown. &nbsp;Today Duplos&nbsp;are simply something he can do with his little sister on the rare occasion that he is willing not to play with his regular Legos,&nbsp;and my daughter is interested in animals, not in airplanes.</p>

<p>Favourite part of the set are aeroplane, lady passenger and the two suitcases. As the other reviewer mentioned, the bottom half of the plane is first built backward. And yes, she struggled to assemble it too at first.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve used it for a couple of years and go back to it every now and again, but at 4 and a half, the current preference is Lego Friends.</p>

<p>The build&nbsp;of the truck and luggage &#39;carousel&#39; is not that exciting. The preference is for the alternatives at the back of the box.</p>
