The ship is a blast from the past, because the first release was in the late 70s. It's rather cheap as it's release price was only 65â‚¬ for almost 1000 pieces. It has mostly basic bricks and plates and some technic parts, but it's rather challenging to build. There are 4 ropes, which can be annoying when placing and cutting them correctly. The model itself is very detailed. It has lots of SNOT guns, a bell and much more., but in this version there are none of the old small 1x1 windows, because they replaced them by 1x1 headlight bricks, which isn't that bad but slightly odd looking. And there are no transparent plates, which changes appearance a little bit. The instruction, are sometimes difficult to follow, but hey the First edition of the 
USS Constellation was first launched in the so-called Hobby Sets range in 1978, which was Pre-Model Team between 1975 and 1978.
Back then instructions were more challenging than today, because they weren't as detailed. And another thing in my copy the instructions still show 1978 as copyright year. But it shows 2002 as copyright year, too. 
Overall: It's a nice and rather cheap big set
But the changes in the appearance bring it down to an 9/10.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
