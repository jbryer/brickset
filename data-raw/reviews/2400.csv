This is a very useful tool for separating bricks that are stuck fast - sometimes having two - one on each part is necessary. It strikes me it would have been very useful to have when I was younger as much of my surviving childhood Lego bears many teeth marks which is how I recall we used to separate bricks in the old days - especially when the tiles did not have a little groove around the bottom – not that this would help you there as it needs studs or holes to lock into. Anyway, it does what is says it does – separates bricks!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"charfdorn","2008-06-18T22:31:14.687Z","Shouldn't it be called a plate separator?","That's what I use it for. I can get bricks with my fingers.

Misnomer aside, this is an essential. I actually have two (one in green) because I'm a huge nerd. And because you can use two to separate two 1 x 2 plates, which are probably the hardest two pieces to pry apart. I'm not really sure how builders got by without these before 1990.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"zipper","2012-02-25T10:42:20.523Z","Very useful!","Back in the day, I bought this to help me when I would play with Legos. I was tired of hurting my fingernails all the time when I would try to seperate some Legos so I ordered the seperator from a Lego catalog. At first I didn't like the price that I had to pay for it, but in the end it saved me from a lot of broken fingernails. This is a must have for people who are constantly building their own Legos.",FALSE,4,3,1,1,4

<p>I own two, I remember getting one years ago in a Lego Bucket not knowing what it does, thinking that it was some odd wing piece.</p>

<p>If only I knew its true purpose sooner. It would have saved me hours of aggravation.</p>

<p>This thing separates pieces quite easily, using leverage. It even separates those pesky 1x2 plates with a breeze.</p>

<p>I highly recommend&nbsp;for anyone not to pass this one up.</p>
