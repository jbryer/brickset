"kyrodes","2015-03-14T00:10:42.99Z","Good for the minifigs, acessories and shark","<p>I bought this set mostly because the shark but the minifigs full of accessories are very cool.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Very easy for starters. You don&#39;t even need to follow the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set have some rare golden parts, diamonds, chains, treasure chest, entire boat, flag, map, shark, barrel, gun, sword, window and a 8x8 baseplate. I dislike the painted wall.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A pegleg pirate and a&nbsp;shivering pirate skeleton full of accessories.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very easy. This is basically a wall. You can build it in few minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set could be very fun to play with a kid. There&#39;s a complete story happening.</p>

"Hashem1983","2015-10-08T05:16:57.34Z","Got the Adults Attraction as Well!!!!","<p>Though this set is targeted for the juniors as their one of the starter sets after playing with&nbsp;Duplo,&nbsp;it still got the attraction of the adults and from my point of view it is because of the black treasure chest which is rare and not found easily, also it does have nice decent parts for its size like the window wall panel.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Box: As all Juniors sets,&nbsp;the box is in red color showing the main set in it with a cartoony&nbsp;background.</p>

<p>The Instruction: It is made for the kids to teach them how to build but for an adult you don&#39;t need it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The main attraction are the black treasure box, the grey barrel,&nbsp;the base plate, the colorful map and the printed window wall panel as well as the shark, you also get an extra chain as a spare part.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mini-figures</h3>

<p>It has two mini-figures, the peg-leg pirate and the old style skeleton&nbsp;that its arms rotates in 360&nbsp;&nbsp;degrees with a red bandana.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simply it was easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The whole thing is attractive and children could play with it for a long time also it could be used as a display model or part of an island.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Its a great set and children could keep this set when they grow up&nbsp;if they liked pirates or even add the mini-figuer&nbsp;as one of the pirate ship crew or to any pirate set. I only wish that the pirate flag wasn&#39;t so much cartoony.</p>

"AranLewis","2015-11-28T19:31:50.273Z","Brucey Bonus","<p>As the title suggests this set is a nice little bonus to the recent Pirates wave which first pulled me into Lego in the mid 90&#39;s so maybe nostalgia has played a part in this review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard format for the Juniors line with nice themed box &amp; instruction art. The instructions are ok and ony necessary due to this being a juniors line, for any other age range the box art would be enough guidance to complete the build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set includes some good and&nbsp;and also&nbsp;rare pieces, the grey barrel, black treasure chest and brick effect 2x1 spring to mid straight away as well as the large printed wall piece.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Great pirate minifig, probably unique and certainly different to any others available in the current pirate theme. Plenty of accessories as well including flag, sword, gun &amp; map as well as the skeleton providing an additional bandana piece.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>&#39;Build&#39; is probably a strong word to use for ths set however it does still do well to set the treasure island scene as intended and also keeping it simple for the target age range.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is quite pleasing and whilst being light on minifigures and maybe therefore playability&nbsp;it probably packs more of a punch as a scene than the shipwreck defence set at a similar price does but I would recommend both to fans of the theme.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A definite for any Pirate fans and also a fairly cheap way to pick up a shark and a rowing boat as well as some of the other attractive pieces.</p>
