<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Decent sized box with good printing and explanation of functions - which are few. Stapled instruction booklets with the usual great standard of print quality and presentation of instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing to get too excited about - standard parts galore. A fairly varied selection of lift arms and panels does mean this is a good donor parts set, and the wheels are quite nice too - their looks&nbsp;easily fit into a number of vehicle types so are good for custom work (Rebrickable has a good selection of MOCs based on this set, proving the point). There are loads of grille pieces too, enough to fill two radiators worth on this truck!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None, and I don&#39;t think anyone would want to sit in that seat anyway! (It&#39;s simply a screen panel that has a 90 degree bend in it and an awkward lump in the middle).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A standard affair, nothing too exciting in the technique. The opening cab section means the steering mechanism is disengaged which is an uncommon thing to see, but it works pretty well. There is an engine hose that requires cutting to length, which is surprising as the norm recently has been to supply them to the correct length. (Note, I didn&#39;t want to cut my one - it&nbsp;does still fit but is very close to rubbing on a back wheel).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final race truck looks ok, it is very dependent on stickers for it&#39;s look though. It works just fine, surprisingly it is not too front heavy so doesn&#39;t tip anywhere near as much as I was expecting. Honestly the B model race car (sort of a muscle car&nbsp;style) is a more visually appealing model to me, although the rear end body work is a little flimsy due to a lack of parts to build&nbsp;with. Aside from steering and an engine, the only other functions on both A and B model are doors and boot that open by hand, and the race truck cab tips forwards by hand too - not exactly exciting features with cool mechanisms.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The models are decent enough, they look like what they are mean to be, but for the parts count in this set I was expecting a bit more functionality. I have sets with a third of the parts of this, but with 50% more functionality. Heavily dependent on stickers, so not great for those who&nbsp;choose to not use them. That said, the attention this set has on Rebrickable means there is plenty of life in it, building a C, D or even E model is pretty unique!</p>
