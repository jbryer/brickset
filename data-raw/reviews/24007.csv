"Tar_Domo","2015-02-18T15:51:05.16Z","Carry on... your troops!","<p>I was so happy to find this <em>hard to find</em> set from BR&acute;s -25% sale. It was the most interesting set of the winter 2015 LEGO Star Wars wave.</p>

<p>The earlier versions:</p>

<p>2001 #7126 173 pcs, 6 standard battle droids, 1 pilot battle droid</p>

<p>2011 #7929 241 pcs, 8 standard battle droids, 2 pilot battle droids, Jar Jar Binks, Gungan soldier</p>

<p>This new version:</p>

<p>2015 #75086 565 pcs, 12 standard battle droids, 2 pilot battle droids, Gungan warrior</p>

<p><strong>Box and instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box was medium-sized. It had the Rebels stormtrooper picture and some pictures about the features of the set.</p>

<p>Instructions were easy to follow. They came in a standard booklet. The booklet had pictures about this SW winter wave.</p>

<p><strong>Pieces and building</strong></p>

<p>This carrier is the biggest version. It has a lot of brown and gray pieces. The set doesn&acute;t include a lot of very special pieces or great pieces for MOCing.</p>

<p>The build takes about an hour. I had no problems. Sometimes it was a bit repetitive build.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>12 standard battle droids in a medium set is a pretty cool deal. Army builders are gonna have fun with them and kids are gonna play great battles with them. I can&acute;t think of a reason someone would dislike it. If you hate the droids, you can at least sell them on ebay/bricklink. But why would&nbsp;you then buy the set? You don&acute;t do anything with a carrier without the troops.</p>

<p>2 battle droid pilots are a great add. Someone needs to pilot the thing!</p>

<p>The Gungan warrior is a cool add. But why only one? I know, because it has so many minifigs already. But at least I could pay a little bit more for&nbsp;5 gungan warriors.</p>

<p><strong>The vehicle</strong></p>

<p>The carrier looks cool when displayed and doen&acute;t break easily. With a few more pieces and droids you can modify it to carry 24 battle droids. The carrier carries also the droids weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>+ 12 standard battle droids for army building and making the carrier look really impressive</p>

<p>+ Bigger carrier than before</p>

<p>+ Gungan warrior</p>

<p>+ 2 Pilot battle droids</p>

<p>+ Great value for money</p>

<p>+ No stickers</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>- Might look a bit odd next to the 2014 MTT which has less battle droids</p>

<p>- Not a lot of interesting pieces</p>

<p>- A bit repetitive build</p>

<p><strong>I can recommend this to army builders, kids and prequel fans.</strong></p>

"HandPositions","2020-05-11T15:53:44.147Z","Battle Droid Army For One!","<p>LEGO set 75086, Battle Droid Troop Carrier, is a very interactive set with many functions and minifigures (if 14 Battle Droids count as minifigures). At $40, this set is extremely underpriced, compared to its&nbsp;piece count of 565 elements.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set includes 15 minifigures, including a Gungan Warrior, 12 Battle Droids, and 2 Battle Droid pilots. The Gungan Warrior has two accessories, a staff and a shield. This minifigure also includes a head piece that is specially printed for this set, although the mould has been included in other sets, such as the AAT and the Flash Speeder. The Battle Droid minifigures are as we always see them. They use the typical Battle Droid pieces, with one arm facing forward and the other sideways. Each Battle Droid has a blaster element as an accessory. Finally, there are two Battle Droid pilots, each with blue torso printings and sideways-facing arms.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set also includes a transporter vehicle, with standing points for all 14 Battle Droid figures. In the front section, there are two points for the Battle Droid pilots to stand on. This section can be detached from the model as a smaller vehicle. On the base of this section, there are circular transparent 2x2 plates with smooth, curved bases to create a sliding or hovering effect. The main vehicle continues the use of these, but also includes transparent Technic wheel elements to further emphasize the hovering ability of the vehicle. In this section, there are two small, detachable platforms with six points for Battle Droids to be attached to. When in motion, the Battle Droids can be connected to the vehicle. When in battle, they can be slid off and detached. In this section, there is also a stand for all 12 blasters to be placed on. At the top, there is a lever. When switched, it will launch the blasters off to be given to the droids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is an amazing set, and is amazing for army building, as it includes 14 Battle Droids. This set has amazing playability, a great value, and loads of functions that children and adults alike will love.</p>
