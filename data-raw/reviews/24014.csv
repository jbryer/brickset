"Bricky_Dee_Williams","2014-10-27T01:22:34.657Z","Don't you know? I'm Electro!","<p>While attending the Lego KidsFest&nbsp;in Virginia, USA, I stopped by the Lego Club Booth since a worker told me I&#39;d be glad I did. And I was. Upon completing a scavenger hunt through a Lego Club magazine, I was given this exclusively, and lucky enough, I was able to do it a second time and received two.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The polybag contains three exclusive parts making up the Electro minifigure. The head contains a detailed microchip implant, just like the one from the movie&nbsp;<em>The Amazing Spiderman 2</em>. The torso and legs are both making up the electric resistant jumpsuit worn by Jamie Foxx in the film, and the character holds two electric pieces, used by other minifigures like Emperor Palpatine or Storm from the X-Men.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a pretty cool minifgure, as most exclusive ones are. He&#39;s not as good as Iron Patriot from 30168, but he is still a great figure for any collection.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was lucky enough to receive one, let alone two of the poly, and now they sell for well over US $100. They are a great edition to ay Marvel or Lego collection, and if it weren&#39;t for the price,mid say get it. And if you can any other way in the future, my verdict is: Get it.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The polybag was the same but instead of Spiderman or avengers. It says the amazing Spiderman 2 making this the first and maybe only as2 figure. That is&nbsp;the only thing that stands out for me. There are no instructions.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only parts there are is 2 bolts of electricity and the minfig&nbsp;parts that are all exclusive. So good parts</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures-1</h3>

<p>Electro as2: This is the 2nd electro ever and i think it&#39;s better then the other one. He is wearing that outfit that Harry Osborn gave to him after he was released from prison. His hands are aqua blue with black arms. His legs has really nice printing with knee pads. His head has a mix of dark blue and aqua blue. His eyes are pure white with no pupils and dark lines under and on the sides of his eyes. He has some metal thing on the side of his head which i never saw in the movie. On the back of his head is the same pattern of the mix of the blues in the front of his face. Electro also has 2&nbsp;lightning bolts as a weapon.</p>

<h3>The building experience</h3>

<p>It took me quick of course so not really much experience there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is one of the better marvel polybags. Some of the other ones have been bad but this one is really good as this fig is exclusive. It is also the only AS2 fig. Like I said I only got this for $6.00 on ebay so it was a really good deal at the end of the day.</p>

<p>You get the normal small minifigure polybag and you don&#39;t get instructions since it is only a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure&nbsp;parts you get two lightning pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Electro is such a great figure to get. The detail on him is incredible. On his head you have the rectangle that you see in the movie. Then his suit is really nicely done&nbsp;as well. It is a really well done figure. Also getting the lightning bolts with the him is nice addition as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Nothing to it just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great figure. The detail on him is great. I liked how they took some of the small details on him from the movie and added to the figure. I also liked that they gave you two lightning bolts. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"WaffleKing","2016-05-15T20:51:27.343Z","Awesome Exclusive","<p>I was one of the lucky ones to get this at the Virginia Brick Fair 2015, and this was a huge surprise since the movie came out a while ago.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing special.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>3/5 of the parts were exclusive, so 60% of the parts were exclusive.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The minifigure&#39;s details are awesome! He looks super cool and fits right in with my Marvel minifigure collection!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing special.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The minifigure looks complete, and for a price of $0 or even $6, this a great purchase for any Lego fan, whether they like superheroes, or castle.&nbsp; Well done Lego!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great minifigure!</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-10T20:03:18.84Z","Olâ€™ Sparky","<p>For my 11th foray in reviewing, we have&nbsp;5002125-1: Electro, the first and only set from the ill-fated Amazing Spider-Man 2. Much like the source, it&#39;s a bold vision that ultimately doesn&#39;t work.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure/Build: The bag contains just five pieces, two lighting bolts and the head, torso, and legs of Jamie Foxx&#39;s Max Dillon. In the comics, Electro is a common thief with the ability to manipulate electricity after an accident. Spider-Man has several villains who suffered accidents and other who are basically just thieves, so Electro is a bit of both. In the movie, the story tried to make Max more sympathetic. It doesn&#39;t really work in the movie and thankfully we got the MCU/Sony deal as a result.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure is a great depiction of this version of Electro, right down to the implant in his head. The torso and legs are highly detailed as well, showing his specialized insulation suit. As usual, there&#39;s no arm printing.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability and price: Since LEGO has not made a minifigure version of the original green and yellow Electro (though there is a great DUPLO version), this is the only way to get Electro&nbsp;for your Sinster Six. If you&#39;re not going for that, this figure is an easy pass since the ASM movies have gone away. I found someone offering this at a really great price, so I snagged it. Otherwise, you can let this one go.&nbsp;</p>
