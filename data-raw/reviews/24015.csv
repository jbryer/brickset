<p>The price is a bit on the high side; you only get one piece per set!</p>

<p>If you want to buy these baseplates, just make sure you don&#39;t mix it with the old ones, if you have, other than that its good for building, but the price should be cheaper.</p>

<p>There is no building experience, what you get is what you get. The plate however is an amazing piece and provides usefulness for display or playability. The value is good at $8.</p>

You really cant go wrong getting this for someone who owns LEGO. Buy it for just about anyone. You can just stand your minifigures on it if you want to. The possiblilities are endless.</p>
