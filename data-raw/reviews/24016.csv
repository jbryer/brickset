"donutsftw","2014-11-21T23:31:30.86Z","Definitely worth picking up","<p>It&#39;s everyone&#39;s favorite talking raccoon! Currently, this polybag is exclusive to Toys R Us (at least in the US) and is <a href=""http://www.thebrickfan.com/lego-marvel-super-heroes-rocket-raccoon-5002145-toys-r-us-ad/"">apparently supposed to be a promotional freebie</a>. However, in defiance of the &quot;Not for sale&quot; declaration on the back of the bag, I was able to find one for sale in with some other assorted polybags at my local TRU.</p>

<p>Obviously the Rocket minifig is the real draw here: although this version isn&#39;t exclusive to this polybag, the only other set it&#39;s been in was the Comic Con exclusive. It&#39;s great that that fig has found its way into a (slightly) easier to get set, because it&#39;s an awesome fig. The torso is printed on its front, back, and arms. The tail piece is made from a softer, rubbery plastic and sits between the legs and torso. The legs are standard short minifig legs, which are printed on the fronts and sides. I&#39;m not sure if this is the first set to have short minifig legs with printing on the sides (as opposed to being made from multiple colors like some of the Simpsons figs), but I&#39;ve never seen the short minifig legs with side printing before. Finally, Rocket&#39;s head and shoulders are made from ABS and attach quite firmly to the neck of the torso.</p>

<p>The remaining parts are used to make a smaller version of Rocket&#39;s oversized rifle and a pot for the Groot sapling. Nothing too interesting parts-wise; the pot is made from a pearl gold fez set upside down on a 2x2 round tile with a hole, and the rifle is made from a space blaster with binoculars and a scope clipped on, all of which are quite common parts. However, the brown &quot;carrot top&quot; piece that serves as the Groot sapling has so far only appeared in one other set, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/3316-1/Friends-Advent-Calendar"">3316 Friends Advent Calendar</a>.</p>

<p>What really makes this polybag interesting is that it includes a sticker sheet for customizing <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76021-1/The-Milano-Spaceship-Rescue"">the Milano</a>. I don&#39;t normally like stickers, but man, these are neat. There&#39;s a number of different stickers for portraying battle damage, including bullet holes and gouges with mechanical details exposed underneath, and cracks in the cockpit. There&#39;s also small stickers for &quot;Awesome Tape #1/#2&quot; and &quot;I (heart) 80s&quot;, as well as a set of raccoon pawprints. But wait, there&#39;s more! There&#39;s also stickers for customizing the Nova Corp ship and Necrocraft from <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76019-1/Starblaster-Showdown"">76019 Starblaster Showdown</a>.The stickers are the clear kind and are on a heavier grade paper than normal Lego stickers so they don&#39;t too bent or folded, and they&#39;re even in a separate bag so there&#39;s virtually no chance of them peeling off. If only Lego did this for every sticker sheet...</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great polybag: It&#39;s got a superbly detailed minifig with cool accessories, and a very interesting bonus sticker sheet. Definitely pick this one up if you get the chance.</p>

<p>So, as the bag says, the set is exclusive to ToysRUs stores. I had to search high and low, and eventually found a store that had over 190 in stock. I picked up a few, and it was definitely worth it.</p>

<p><b>Set/ Pieces:</b></p>

<p>The set, which is only $5, contains 12 pieces, but&nbsp;I can&#39;t figure out why it says thirteen. There are three pieces to the potted Groot, (which, not to give away any plot details, is simply growing like any other plant&nbsp;at this point)&nbsp;four making up Rocket (he has a nice rubber table piece in back), and five pieces making up the gun, so I&#39;m guessing they counted the sticker sheet. It does come with a sticker sheet for the Milano, including stickers with cracks, metal decals, and an &quot;I Love 80&#39;s&quot; slogans.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:</b></p>

<p>Speaking of the Milano, the gun can go in the extra handle across from the fire extinguisher in the ship, and Rocket can sit in back with Groot. This version has incredible printing on the arms, sides of the legs, and the feet are even a different color than the legs, a nice maroon color for the legs and a dark grey for the feet, along wth his tail piece and head. His head piece has shoulders attached to it, and the figure is an overall wonderful minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s great that the SDCC wasn&#39;t the only way to get it, and if you have a chance to buy it, make sure to pick this one up. It&#39;s a great set and minifigure for any collector, fan, or just a kid with a craving for Legos or superheroes. You should pick this one up, and buy a couple.&nbsp;Don&#39;t try and profit like a scalper, and buy twenty, or hundreds, but pick this one up.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-10-27T14:16:30.037Z","A Guardian of Galaxies","<p><strong>Set #5002145 Rocket Racoon: </strong>This is a polybag which includes only a Minifigure, therefore the review for this set will focus on that and that alone.</p>

<p>Minifigure</p>

<p>Rocket Racoon: This is Rocket as seen at the end of the movie during the big climactic battle. As such he has a dark maroon torso with a double-sided print and side printing on the arms. You also have side printing for the first time ever on the midget sized Minifigure legs. He includes a unique head sculpt piece and a special racoon tail piece.</p>

<p>For accessories he includes a unique blaster weapon and a mini version of Groot. Who hasn&rsquo;t sprouted his head yet. There&rsquo;s also a massive sticker sheet, to be used on the Milano with extra battle damage and other special markings, including labels for the awesome tape #1 and 2.</p>

<p>As a free gift at Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us it was a great deal, tracking it down now if you missed out will be costly. However if you&rsquo;re interested in owning the entire Guardians cast you&rsquo;ll need this polybag. And the extra details might be interesting for the Milano. Recommended if it can be found for a good price.</p>
