"Broken_Cheese_Slope","2014-10-28T23:35:51.74Z","Return of BIONICLE Mask Collecting","<p>This clear mask was given away at New York Comic Con 2014. It comes in a rather small plastic box with a thin paper inside. The paper says that it is 1&nbsp;of 1500, that it was made in 4 countries(For one part?), and has a link to BIONICLE.com.</p>

<p>The mask is rather small and clear. It has hinges so that it can attach to the new BIONICLE head piece. The mask is the same as the ones in&nbsp;70787-1: Tahu Master of Fire but are in gold in red in that set. The mask is currently odd due to lack of story significance and no set compatibility yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would only suggest you buy this set if you are an ultimate LEGO or BIONCLE&nbsp;fan.</p>

"williamfurno","2014-12-23T22:59:56.873Z","Exclusive Tahu Mask from NYCC 2014!","<p>I think LEGO has made a great move by bringing back collectibles. This one, small mask offers a variety of fans to come spending everything in their wallets just to get a really cool, completely trans Tahu Mask. This mask is a clear version of 70787 Tahu - Master of Fire but can be attached to any of the other new Bionicle head molds. If you are a die-hard collector, I highly recommend trying to get this. I bought this for $35 off of&nbsp;eBay and just to have this rare&nbsp;mask in my collection is just great! &nbsp;</p>

"rioforce","2015-02-11T20:01:01.713Z","Definately a collector's item","<p>I won this set on a LEGO Twitter giveaway while ComicCon was going on. It was random chance, but I was one of the retweeters chosen. When I got the mask in the mail, I opened the package to see a nice transparent mask. When I got it, the Bionicle 2015 sets were not out yet, so there was no compatibility, but I did manage to get the mask to fit on a small brickbuilt stand I made from LEGO System parts.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was fine, it was a thin plastic, easily openable and closeable, with no cutting necessary.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Obviously, this mask is a collector&#39;s item. It has no significance n the Bionicle storyline, and is just a transparent Tahu mask.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Hey, I got it for free. I&#39;ve very happy with it. I don&#39;t know how I will use it, because I do not own the new Tahu, or any of the new Bionicle sets, but it sure does look good sitting on my shelf.</p>
