<p>Standard fare. &nbsp;Nothing special here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I LOVE all the transparent pieces. &nbsp;Nearly half of the set is composed of these 1x2 gems! &nbsp;They work perfectly to create the effect the designer was after. &nbsp;The blues create ice and the whites create icy, packed snow on the sledding hill. &nbsp;This is the first time I&#39;ve seen the ice skates pieces and they add significantly to the set. &nbsp;Both minifigs get them and we received another as an extra. &nbsp;That makes 5 skates in our set! &nbsp;Good use of existing standard parts&nbsp;to create a heartwarming, icy scene. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One man and one girl. &nbsp;I found the clothing choices to be a bit &quot;warm&quot; for&nbsp;minis that are playing outdoors in the winter, but fun nonetheless. &nbsp;I haven&#39;t seen any minifigs&nbsp;with beanies or winter apparel other than the serious research and rescue types. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The focus here is on LOTS of transparent pieces to create an icy landscape. &nbsp;It is a super easy build. &nbsp;The small size of the vast majority of pieces might present a challenge to the youngest of LEGO builders, but with a little supervision, this is a very &quot;doable&quot; set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very esthetically pleasing if not a little small. &nbsp;I plan to expand the landscape. &nbsp;I really like the idea here and want to see it built a bit bigger with two hockey goals. &nbsp;The lamp-post really adds a Christmassy&nbsp;feel to the set and should help tie it into a Christmas themed layout very nicely.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Recommend. &nbsp;It&#39;s a bit pricey on ebay, but then again, lego&nbsp;sets seem to consistently bring more on ebay than the retail price. &nbsp;IMO, there are no pieces here worth buying the set for; this purchase would be because you want the actual set.</p>

"Wipipi","2018-09-16T05:34:50.23Z","My First Winter Village Themed Set","<p>I got this set originally back around&nbsp;Christmas 2014. I believe I got it along side a few Star Wars sets I was given for Christmas. This set is very cute, looks good and most importantly is a great display and play piece.</p>

<p>(Side note, I usually only mark vintage sets that I own as &#39;owned&#39;, however the Winter Village sets are so good they too deserve to be on my owned list.)</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with two minifigures. The first minifigure is a&nbsp;very generic little girl with skates, braided hair and a very common jacket piece. The second one is an older, ginger boy (Or perhaps could be seen as the father) with a green jacket and blue pants. On the box he is seen riding the cute little sled.</p>

<p><strong>Frozen Pond</strong></p>

<p>The set is mainly focused on the small little frozen pond area. Next to it is a black lamp post, a great addition, and a red goal. Kids who are playing with the set can try to shoot the pucks included with the set through the goal. The frozen pond itself looks very nice and it&#39;s smooth to the touch. Very good to slide your figures around on. There are two hockey sticks available. I especially like how they are brick-built, adding more to the classic charm.</p>

<p><b>Ice Ramp</b></p>

<p>The little ice ramp is one of my favorite inclusions. There are small steps leading up to it where you can slide the sled off. (Obviously) Depending&nbsp;on how hard you push it the faster it will go down. The ramp itself isn&#39;t too big but can be positioned differently for a different route for the sled to go through. The ramp looks very nice and is a great play feature. There is some small shrub life at the bottom of the ramp.</p>

<p><strong>Only Cons</strong></p>

<p>The only cons I can see is that the snowballs, spare skates and pucks can all get lost easily. I&#39;m still trying to find where my pucks fell! You can stick them on the build but granted it doesn&#39;t look as good. Oh well.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>This is a very cute winter set and is a great way to start off your winter village. The cons are fairly negligible. This set is a great gift for any kid for Christmas! That is why I give this set 5 stars.</p>
