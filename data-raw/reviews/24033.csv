It&rsquo;s another impressively DK Publishing book featuring a Theme that is highly popular, unfortunately it&rsquo;s two years old by now and so only features four of the release waves. However it features a nice Minifigure that you won&rsquo;t find anywhere else, so definitely worth tracking down for fans of Ninjago.</p>

<p>Presentation</p>

<p>Once again I find myself discussing the same white covers of DK Publishing LEGO books. In this case we get to see many Ninjago elements from characters to shrines and even some of the vehicles on the back cover, it&rsquo;s a delight for the eyes.</p>

<p>In Canada you are asked to pay 22.99$ for this book. For a 96 page book of this size that seems a bit high, especially when LEGO Star Wars The Dark Side was under 20$ and that&rsquo;s a book for a licensed Theme. Finding it on sale or at Costco where the prices are always 50% off is definitely worth it, full price it&rsquo;s really up to you if you are willing to spend that much for content that is outdated by now and for a Minifigure that, while limited to this title, is still just another variant of one of the Ninja.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Zane Rebooted: This version of Zane is not suffering from battle damage, instead he has an ordinary double-sided torso print for his gi, a regular facial expression and the lower bandana piece to cover his mouth, with the straight almost crew cut hair piece in blonde for his hair. He has no weapons unfortunately, you&rsquo;ll have to give him some spares from your collection of Ninjago weapons. All-in-all not a bad Minifigure to include with the book, though had it been more unique it might have stood out. Zane Rebooted was also included with one of the Ninjago sets from that year as well if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>Contents</p>

<p>This book covers a wide variety of topics. It includes pages on the first four years of the Ninjago Theme, with everything you wanted to know about the sets in that era, the front of the book includes a set database which omits a few key items, mostly just Polybag sets, while the back showcases every single variant of the Ninja and their enemies in Minifigure form from those first four years. It&rsquo;s really quite enjoyable actually.</p>

<p>The rest of the pages cover in-universe content, set information, model write-ups for the vehicles and shrines of the Ninjago world and even some info on taking the physical LEGO and turning it into a television show and video game. So basically what you&rsquo;d expect to find in LEGO Visual Dictionaries. It&rsquo;s well put together and while online sites such as Brickset tend to make these books superfluous, it does look nice on a Bookshelf and gives you the opportunity to pick it up and flip through the pages whenever you feel like it.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Highly Recommended. The LEGO Visual Dictionaries have all been highly impressive and stand out as fun/interesting reads for fans of the LEGO Brick. There is some fun info to be found here and the showcase pages allow you to enjoy looking at all the sets and Minifigures from a Theme when you don&rsquo;t have access to the internet. Such as long car rides or trips on a plane to visit someone. LEGO and DK have done a great job with their partnership since it started, and while sometimes the titles are a bit lackluster, the contents can still be fun more often than not.</p>
