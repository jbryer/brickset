<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>In my brief LEGO&trade; fan history,I am amazed at the instructions.They are like the best I have ever seen;clear,bold,clear,bold......</p>

<p>Anyways,I don&#39;t really pay much attention to instructions that are this size,personally,I follow the instructions when I have sets that are much bigger than this!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of parts here that are unique to my collection...I always seem to end up with &nbsp;a few extra parts after building LEGOs,well this IS a creator set after all......</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>In comparison to my other builds,this took me around 30 minutes or less to build.Relatively simple and easy for begineers and &nbsp;kids like me,not for 16+ folks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I built the &quot;Jet&quot; part(This is a creator set) of the set,and I admit,I was pretty satisfied at the result.The overall design was like &nbsp;a MIG-17 or something but it definetly fits in with my collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion&#39;</h3>

<p>This was a great set for me,although a tiny bit boring because of the relatively few parts in comparison to my other builds!</p>

<p>The box is A4 with good depth (yay) and punch-tabs (boo). On the front you can see the snazzy space mech, the snazzy jet plane, and the snazzy car, and you get the same on the back from different angles, plus an inset showing that the mech&#39;s&nbsp;jet-pack can be removed for reasons of fire safety in more populated areas. The instructions are three separate booklets, one per model, with the mech&nbsp;booklet being the thickest.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Orange studs! So many orange studs - nineteen in total (not counting the spare). You also get eight orange vents, five bright-trans-blue&nbsp;dishes, four bright-trans-blue&nbsp;wedges (and a spare), lots of white curved slopes... It&#39;s an Apple product, but in Lego form, basically. The black wing pieces are nice too.</p>

<h3><strong>The builds</strong></h3>

<p>Nothing too surprising here if you&#39;ve built a mech -&nbsp;or a jet, or a car - before. The lower and upper legs are connected in a way I haven&#39;t seen before, giving the mech&nbsp;knees that work like actual knees. The jet uses studs and plates to allow the wings to fold in and out a bit, which is also neat. Appropriately for the age range, this is so easy a child could do it, and the completed models are nice and sturdy. By the way, if you plan on building the car to see how it looks in the flesh, get a brick separator so you can get the tyres off the rims if you want to see the other models again.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed models</strong></h3>

<p>First and foremost, I&#39;m not a fan of the car. I&#39;ve never been that big on the &#39;iPod future&#39; aesthetic as a general theme anyway, and it reminds me of the cars Audi was designing in the mid 00&#39;s. Luckily the style works much better on the jet and mech. The folding wings and adjustable tail fins (I know they have a proper name, but whatever) on the jet are pretty neat, and it is easily swooshed about without the fear of bits falling off.</p>

<p>The mech, however, is the real star of this set. The combination of colours looks fantastic on it, and details like the blue glow on the leg and back jets make me very pleased. The wings can be folded up and down, the back jets can tilt forwards, the arm and hand posing&nbsp;is great... My only real gripes are with the legs, where the combination of proper knees with thighs that can&#39;t twist mean it can be a little difficult to get good standing poses. Oh, and the model is, once again, fantastic for swooshing about. Yes, I am a child pretending to be an adult.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>I love the mech, as something both to look at and to play with. He shall definitely be taking pride of place on my increasingly cluttered shelf. As for the other models, there are better, more dedicated sets for each out their. The mech is great, though. Get the mech. And then fly to space.</p>
