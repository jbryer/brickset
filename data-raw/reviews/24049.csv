Stop-motion makers, MOCers, and anyone who plays guys in a house, in a desert, on a volleyball court, on Mars, or in a giant vat&nbsp;of almond butter will like this set. Garunteed. I would post pictures of the completed set, but, y&#39;know....Oh! There it is on the left-hand side of this review! And that&#39;s what it looks like in real life.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was, in this case, a bag the plate&#39;s size and opened like a pack of fruit snacks. I don&#39;t want to sound like an AFOL, (no offense!) but the packaging was simple yet effective. The dotted arrow at the top right corner conveyed&nbsp;<em>exactly&nbsp;</em><strong>how to get that Lego goodness out of that bag</strong>! Yellow is a good color.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>What piece is individually more useful than this one?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I haven&#39;t found any yet.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I must hold the world record for fastest assembly of a set. <strong>0.1 seconds!</strong></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A bit bare, but it perfectly depicts 99% of the Sahara Desert.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Everybody needs one of these. Most need about 10 of them. <em>&quot;But it&#39;s eight dollars!&quot;</em>&nbsp;Well, think of it this way: You can either get this baseplate, or two CMFs and eight gumballs. Another big plus, my&nbsp;Prince of Persia palace fits on this baseplate&nbsp;<strong>perfectly!</strong>&nbsp;Couldn&#39;t have asked for a better color of plate either. I would buy one for you if I could. ;)</p>
