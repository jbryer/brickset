And as this version of the release includes two separate listings on Brickset for the Polybag Contents and the Book I shall be discussing the models separately in their own review for the Polybag. That means we&rsquo;ll mostly be discussing the elements of the book here.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>As a LEGO DK Brickmaster book this title is relatively typical of that style. The pages are mostly built up of instructions, the cover showcases all of the various models and play scenarios found inside and the style works quite well for Ninjago.</p>

<p>There are a couple of pages in the front of the book that explains about the characters included and the world of Ninjago as a whole. Overall it&rsquo;s an ok package for what you&rsquo;re getting.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>All of the pages here have crisp clear large lettering, and detailed instructions to build out your play scenarios. This being an Updated and Expanded edition means that it has included more material, as I do not have the original to compare it to I can&rsquo;t be 100% sure what&rsquo;s been added aside from the new models and play scenario.</p>

<p>The page design is impressively handled and I do like it, fans of the Ninjago Theme will have a ball reading about the world, the characters and the fun little speech bubbles included throughout the book as well as the detailed information on each new model that can be built.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be honest, as I only have the book to explore for this portion of the review it is difficult to make too many recommendations. And yet I do find that this title and the included pieces does feature some impressive and fun little builds for the younger fans. AFOLs are obviously more interested in actual sets, however as this book is still available at most book stores it&rsquo;s the only way to still get the Frakjaw Minifigure. I have an issue with the price though, at 34.99 in Canada these Brickmaster books can be very poorly received for the price-per-piece and value ratios. Costco has a tendency to bring these out every so often at more than half price, which makes for a much better value. And I&rsquo;m certain Amazon might offer sales or incentives occasionally for these titles.</p>

<p>See part two of my review which will cover the polybag, the models and the Minifigures to get the full recommendation. As far as this book is concerned it&rsquo;s nicely designed and I do enjoy what DK does with their Brickmaster titles so consider this a recommendation.</p>
