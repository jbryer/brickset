I feel that this is the ultimate template for any future games and here is why.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>This game is gorgeous. You get a massive interconnected hub world using planet portals to send you from one place to the next where you go to unlock levels and explore to your hearts content.</p>

<p>The number of playable characters is already massive and can be expanded even further with tons of DLC content. The graphics and dialogue is a huge step up from Batman 2 and we get loads of snippets of fun and funny dialogue that is fitting of the LEGO brand style of entertainment.</p>

<p><strong>Game Play</strong></p>

<p>If there is anything to complain about it is found here. The game play is hugely improved from LEGO Batman 2 with a lot more to do. The puzzles and levels are all very well designed and the powers are diverse and exciting meaning that they don&rsquo;t all feel like the same character just re-skinned like in some titles.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are a few issues I have. Vehicle and Flight controls are very frustrating, I haven&rsquo;t tried to modify them with the options menu, but as this was relatively new for everyone when it was released I can safely say that it&rsquo;s still a problem, future titles have had races and these races are very unforgiving in reaching the goal in time.</p>

<p>This is a minor complaint. The DLC content is relatively short unfortunately, the levels are nowhere near as long as the campaign levels and really misses the point of adapting elements from other DC Cinematic endeavours. The levels are based on certain television shows and movies and they do not cover nearly as much of the story as some of the main campaign levels do for the main story. They&rsquo;re cheap at least, but I do wish that there were more options for longer levels to actually enjoy Man of Steel or The Dark Knight Trilogy.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend this game in spite of some of the hiccups it has. There is a lot of material to cover and many collectibles, this is one of the largest Games I&rsquo;ve played to date, taking cues from The LEGO Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit by featuring more levels, a larger hub world/universe and a load of stuff to do to enjoy the game. The game breaking glitches that are a constant are sometimes still present with the screen freezing that is common, at this point that particular bug seems to be something that is inevitable when dealing with Traveler&rsquo;s Tales. A shame really, because if they could eliminate whatever programming bug causes these annoying issues it would go a long way from improving the overall experience of playing these games.</p>
