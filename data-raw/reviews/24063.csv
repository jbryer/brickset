<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is a box, it&#39;s cardboard with a printed image of the set. The instructions however are clear and come in one huge book, not separate books!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Amazing new parts, the reflective mirror is my favourite.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Probably the least interesting part of the set but still great! You don&#39;t buy modular buildings for the minifigures but this comes with 6 &#39;characters&#39;. This is the first modular with it&#39;s own story and the minifigures play there part well with really detailed printed torso&#39;s</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really fun to build, it took me and Mrs Postie around 2 and half hours to build. Lots of fun!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great, goes really well with the other modulars, we have done a time lapse video of the build for your reference. Check it out at&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW9SI5jCWlk"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yW9SI5jCWlk</a></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>5 out of 5, 10 out of 10, it&#39;s Lego, it&#39;s a Modular and they just keep getting better!</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2015-01-09T20:52:57.443Z","I spy with my LEGO eye.","<p>&quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. &quot;Double Indemnity&quot;. &quot;Le Samoura&iuml;&quot;. To avid movie watchers and perhaps those of a certain age, these and a myriad of other titles immediate invoke images that have been hard-wired into Western cultural sensibilities: smoky offices, men in trenchcoats, seductive women, and a gritty underbelly of a city barely holding together through the Roaring Twenties and the grim thirties. It is into this collective consciousness that the LEGO Company now taps into, building on Prohibition-era imagery spearheaded by &quot;The Untouchables&quot; and the like. Some might find it strange that LEGO has chosen to work within a theme that is decidedly alien to many within the so-called targeted demographic, but is it really that odd - at least as far as modulars are concerned? Do many fourteen year olds imagine a night experiencing <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10243-1/Parisian-Restaurant"">French haute cuisine</a>, or <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10224-1/Town-Hall"">navigating the baffling complexities of the local bureaucracy</a>? I would say that the inimitable Jaime is being almost sarcastic in his <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpshhxplgAU"">Designer video</a>: &quot;Oh sure, &#39;kids&#39; will LOVE smuggling candy into an apartment, which is inexplicably considered to be contraband by local law enforcement.&quot; AFOLs: please don&#39;t ever say that LEGO does not make sets specifically for you. Adults who think that playing with LEGO is infantile: try and build this set without instructions and see how far you get. (Heck, try sorting the pieces from this set in a logical manner and see how far you get.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The overview of the construction has already been given an outstanding treatment by <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/13564/review-10246-detective-s-office"">Huw</a>, our noble site administrator, so I won&#39;t bother repeating anything said either in Jaime&#39;s video or in Huw&#39;s excellent review. Instead, I&#39;ll just give a couple of thoughts and impressions and a few things that surprised me as the lucky owner now of six modular buildings. For those who like the bottom line: I would rank Detective&#39;s Office below Parisian Restaurant and Pet Shop (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10218-1/Pet-Shop"">10218</a>), but ahead of the others. It&#39;s significantly smaller than just about every other modular thus far - I was particularly surprised by how much empty space there is behind the buildings - but, at the same time, it&#39;s a lot more detailed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get into the specifics by talking about the baseplate first: sorry guys, but I really wasn&#39;t feeling the brown. I know it&#39;s nice in general to have baseplates with different colours, but it felt like I was putting a building on mud (or worse). I swapped it for the light grey one that Parisian Restaurant uses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s kind of amazing but I found there to be no sections here that were particularly tedious or boring, and that&#39;s no mean feat. I sing the praises of the Parisian Restaurant a lot, but one does have to admit that those roof details were very fiddly. Detective&#39;s Office manages a lot of &quot;special effects&quot; through what some nerds call NPU, or &quot;nice parts usage&quot;, and the roof certainly gets special mention here. And speaking of nice parts, it&#39;s practically mandatory that I mention the mirror. I have yet to understand the precise motivations for including one - especially considering it&#39;s a long shot to even call it a &quot;piece&quot; since it has literally no compatibility with anything else - but I guess it&#39;s need and I&#39;m sure geniuses will find ways to put it to good use in the near future. There&#39;s plenty of space on the ground floor for positioning Minifigures, so that&#39;s nice.</p>

<p>The second floor is a bit odd. The staircase in the barber seems to lead up to an apartment, but it&#39;s really just a bathroom (albeit a really cool one) and the titular detective&#39;s office is right across a hallway that sort of has to be imagined. At this point we start seeing the use of 1x1 round black &quot;stud&quot; pieces with a hole through them - a very cool piece, and what is quite baffling here is that there are a lot of places where one of those is used when a regular black stud piece would suffice with no averse consequences. At first I thought that this was just a cost-saving measure, but it turns out that regular black stud pieces are included in this set too, so I&#39;m confused. But it&#39;s a boon in many ways - even a very modest LEGO collector is bound to have spare stud pieces everywhere, and a quick swap out will earn you a lot of the ones with the hole through them, which are relatively rare. I finished the build with fifteen &quot;spare&quot;. You get a lot of printed pieces to give the office a lot of nice detail, which is nice. I want someone to tell me (a) the text of the 2x2 LEGO newspaper and (b) if the map is supposed to represent anything. PM me any time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, we get to the third floor and the roof. The third floor is where the &quot;cookies&quot; are baked. Yeah, okay. I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s space to fit in a bathtub but I&#39;m sure it could be done. It&#39;s a cute kitchen but it&#39;s hardly a livable dwelling space - no bed? I reckon they have to sleep outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roof is so incredibly well done that it deserves mentioning again. I will spoil the construction of the barrel for you: it&#39;s made from tank treads, and 1x3 tiles are evidently able to connect to them. I would never have imagined that, and that is absolutely great. The roofing detail on the left is made from (Bionicle?) fist pieces - quite funny but also very effective - and the right roof is made from Unikitty tails (no spares to make Metal Unikitty, sorry). Except for the barrel, it&#39;s all wide open space there - great for setting up an action scene or two.</p>

<p>The final result is about as different from Parisian Restaurant as you can possibly get: it&#39;s gritty, it&#39;s shady, and, well, unfortunately, it&#39;s a bit small. But that doesn&#39;t detract from how beautiful it looks when it&#39;s all done, and the interior detail is so stunning that it&#39;s almost a shame that there still isn&#39;t an &quot;official&quot; way to light the insides of buildings. Pet Shop has a great exterior but almost nothing by way of interior; what Detective&#39;s Office sacrifices in contrast is volume.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So is it worth it? If you&#39;re reading this close to its time of publication, Flower Cart (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40140-1/Flower-Cart"">40140</a>) is a promo freebie that will go a long way in enhancing the experience - please read my review of that set to find out what. It&#39;s really hard to go wrong with a modular, and what this set has going for it that makes it different from its predecessors is that it does have a bit of a scenario attached to it, though I doubt that&#39;s why you would be interested in this. There are not too many new techniques being used here, but this set does get a lot of points for &quot;nice parts use&quot;. In my opinion, I have no regrets - now to get to filming a LEGO version of &quot;The Third Man&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

"Sethro3","2017-01-28T16:48:48.89Z","Of all the Pool Halls, she had to walk into mine","<p>On first glance I was disappointed in this set. It lacked something the other modulars gave me. But the modular buildings are a must buy for me every year, so I knew I was going to get it anyway. It was after building it and staring at it, I was able to finally appreciate it.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong><br />
- Interesting color scheme. The medium nougat color works really well for the brick facade. I love the light royal blue color intermixed with the medium blue. I&#39;m not quite sure on the brown walls between them, but it blends well enough. The green awnings are a new technique.</p>

<p>- New pieces and/or new part colors. Personal favorite, Unikitty&#39;s tail in dark bluish gray. It adds a lot of detailing to the roof line. The black paint roller works incredibly well for the light fixtures. I hope they do that in other colors (I&#39;m hoping red).</p>

<p>- The brand new reflective mirror! It is the same size as a 1x4x5 glass window pane, but mirror coated. I&#39;m not sure how they made it, but either way it is effective and looks great. It is only in 2 modular sets as far as I know, so hold on to that rare item.</p>

<p>- The Pool sign is cleverly put together. I don&#39;t love the placement, but it is realistic enough for what you&#39;d imagine. Also, the spelling of Al&#39;s is clever. I loved it in the Pet Shop and I love it here.</p>

<p>- The pool table of course. The whole Highlander area is neat. Printed windows. New dartboard piece. I even like the reddish-brown axle connectors making up the front. Also a cleverly designed ceiling fan using snowshoes!</p>

<p>- As mentioned the roof detailing on both buildings is clever and they both contrast really well. I ended up turning my bionicle fist pieces the other way to change it up, but it looks neat both ways.</p>

<p>- The tree is decent. I think I like this tree style more than Brick Bank, but it needs something more. Maybe just taller with more foliage, I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>- And like all other Modulars, the classic smiley. It makes me happy to see this continuation. The variety of figures works well here too. Although, a detective AND a police woman can&#39;t catch the sneaky criminal?</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- Size. It feels too small. I know the new trend is smaller footprint, but more detail and includes a story. But this comes off as way too small considering it is two buildings. The upstairs to Al&#39;s is small enough you can&#39;t even fit any hands in there to play (including my 7 year old daughter). The same goes for Al&#39;s too. It is set up really neat with the cabinet and chair and mirror, but you can&#39;t really set up any people in there to create a scene.</p>

<p>- The play features can go in both pros/cons. It is a fun idea, but too elaborate and hidden in this case. The difficulty increases since you have to go through the back and underneath the buildings to smuggle the cookies in. I view these sets as more of a display model instead of a play toy, mostly because of size, cost and age recommendations. Granted, I still let my daughter play with them and that is where I realize how difficult it can be.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>If the above review gives any indication, I would say I love this set way more than I hate it. There are drawbacks, of course, but overall it is a worthwhile build and you may only appreciate it by building it yourself or seeing someone else&#39;s completed model. Pictures don&#39;t do it justice. I would highly recommend picking it up. It is still available through most avenues at MSRP, so why wait?</p>

"Hobbythom","2016-03-25T07:45:22.9Z","The case of the missing 'WOW' factor","<p>The modulars are undoubtly one of the most popular themes amongst AFOL&#39;s. And righteously so: they are intricate models with great parts usage and unique architectural features. Will the detective&#39;s office continue this trend?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a big box with the D.O. prominently featured on the front. The instructions come in one booklet. Nothing special all in all.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is both the greatest aspect of this set and it&#39;s weakest. This set features some great parts: the mirror, the sciccors, the unikitty tails. Yet it features so little of the generic building blocks in the many different colors that it is constructed of that it doesn&#39;t lend itself that well as a parts pack or as a basis for a MOC.</p>

<p>It does however come with a plethora of doors and windows with some very nice printed window panes.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are okay. The match the vibe of the neighbourhood very well. One thing though, a personal pet peeve: the torso of Al the barber. WHAT IS THAT? It looks like a torso you would find in a &#39;94 set. His bow tie is between his nipples, the vertical striping is more akin to a sports jersey.. I dislike this torso so much...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I felt that which each floor the building process became a bit les interesting. While the roof has some interesting details the build itself is quite repetitive. The highlights in terms of construction for me were the pool table (excellent, just wonderful), the ceiling fan-lamp thing (so lifelike!) and the water tank on the roof. It is also nice to see the lettering featured in the Pet shop make a return.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is a very diverse, city-like block. It just works, you see New York, the grimy alleys where the regular Joes live.&nbsp; And it is wonderful next to the Brick Bank (put the Pool cafe and the laundromat next to each other). While you might argue about choice of color for the blue walls on the second and third floor, it does prevent the building from becoming to drab.</p>

<p>Could it be improved? Yes, I think so:</p>

<p>-Personally I would have liked a separate entrance with a stairs on the back side for the office.</p>

<p>-The toilet area could have been a normal apartment.</p>

<p>-That tree just looks wrong. It is to small and doesn&#39;t fit the type of neighborhood in my opinion.</p>

<p>So minor criticism basically.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All things considered I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good time building. However, if budget is an issue this wouldn&#39;t be my first choice amongst the modulars available. For me it just lacks the WOW factor that Parisian Restaurant or the Brick Bank brought although I can not pinpoint why. But again, make no mistake: this is an excellent model.&nbsp; 4 outta 5!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>HUGE box, probably is 4 feet long. It comes with 1 BIG instruction manual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Simple minifigures, generic smile faces, with some great torsos! A new hair piece is included for the policewoman.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was VERY repetitive, so if you don&#39;t like that, don&#39;t buy this set. It was great though, including little things like the toilet, pool table, dartboard, and the cookie smugglers!</p>

"JellyBeanie","2016-12-01T16:45:12.29Z","Humongous LEGO Set --- What could be Better?","<p>Hello, Review Readers Of Brickset! Here I am again to review the biggest set I own: the Detectives Office. Is this set a true gem, or does it deserve to be thrown in the cooler? READ ON!!!</p>

<p>Ha! ha! ha! See what I did there? Great joke, huh? Anyway, next paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>The Box </strong>is big. Very big, and the front shows the model in all it&#39;s jaw-dropping-ness. Near the left edge, Ace Brickman is investigating a suspicious trail of cookies . . . but more on that later. All the minifigures in the set are out on the sidewalk silently conversing with one another, except for Brickman&#39;s client, who&#39;s in a Damsel-In-Distress sort of position, holding out a letter. Meanwhile, on the far right there&#39;s a box displaying the Expert logo, the dimensions of the building, and how it can split into three sections ( again, more on that later ). Officially, you have to be 16+ to build it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Parts </strong>are many, 2,262 to be precise! There&#39;s a ton of printed pieces, such as the newspapers, the windows to the Highlander, Brickman&#39;s window, a dart board, all the cookies, a clock, a map, the letters, a painting, and the police cap. And a Wanted poster. I think that&#39;s all of them. There are some spare wigs displaying in Al&#39;s window ( Al&#39;s a barber ): Luke Skywalker&#39;s and Doc Ock&#39;s wigs, if you want to know. There are also a ton of mason bricks, beige bricks, navy blue bricks, light blue bricks, brown bricks, and puce bricks. Ha! ha! ha! I had you there for a second, didn&#39;t I? Ha! ha! ha! Oh man, I&#39;m losing it *wipes nose*.&nbsp; Okay, okay.There are about 87,000,000,000 flowers included here. That&#39;s a lot. The good parts are these: Scissors, Earth Green domes, a fedora, a clear head, cookies ( you can never have enough), some red bowls, an Elves/Friends plant, black Apollo studs, a little propeller, one of those weird nunchuks handle in brown, a cat, a life preserver, some little flattish domes, Dark Bley Unikitty tails, Dark Bley Hero Factory hands, a bunch of black telescopes, some black paint roller handles, White drawers, and a Clear mug. And a Brown 32x32 baseplate. And doors and windows of varying colors. I&#39;m, pretty sure that&#39;s all. You might have noticed I rated the Parts 4 out of 5: This is because I&#39;m too afraid to take this set apart; it looks too nice on my shelf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong> is not the reason to get this model. They are all mainly generic, though simplicity is the best choice here, as the Detective&#39;s Office is swimming with details.</p>

<p><strong>Ace Brickman</strong> is the star here. He&#39;s clad in Brick Yellow pants and a Sand Blue jacket, with a fedora that can be swapped for some Chase McCain hair. You can stick a magnifying glass and a suitcase ( Newt Scamander would be jealous ) in his hands. He has, like all the others a generic Smiley Face.</p>

<p><strong>The Client</strong> has a Bright Red tank top, complete with matching pants. She currently is baking cookies for someone in her apartment. I assume her weapon is a rolling pin.</p>

<p><strong>The Policewoman</strong> has Ma Cop&#39;s torso, a Dark Brown bun in her hair, and Navy Blue pants. She also has a police cap if you wish to make her carry or wear it.</p>

<p><strong>Al the Barber</strong> has his own barber shop as his name implies. He&#39;s wearing a stripey shirt, a red bow tie, and White pants. He shares his hair with Ben Kenobi.</p>

<p><strong>The Villain </strong>is playing darts in the Highlander. He wears an open blue jacket, revealing a red shirt underneath, and a pair of Dark Brown trousers. There&#39;s a red cap in the trash can out back, and if you put it on him --- Hey Presto! He becomes the Wanted man! But normally he has some spikey black hair. He is completely ignoring . . .</p>

<p><strong>. . . The Accomplice,</strong> who is playing a solitary game of Pool next to him. He has on a button-up plaid shirt, some Sand Yellow pants that are the same color as the carpet, and a Dark Bley knit cap. He&#39;s wielding a Pool stick.</p>

<p><strong>The Cat</strong> is the same color as Woody&#39;s hat, and has printed stripes and face. The same piece was used with Mrs. Scratchen-Post in the LEGO Movie CMF.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build </strong>took me and my sisters FOUR DAYS to complete! In order, you build:</p>

<p>The first floor --- Al&#39;s Barber Shop, the Highlander, and the sidewalk.</p>

<p>The second floor --- Ace Brickman&#39;s, a toilet ( awesome ), and a balcony.</p>

<p>The third floor --- The roof with a water tower and a skylight, another balcony, and The Client&#39;s apartment.</p>

<p>The small roof --- Is where we use Unikitty&#39;s tails and build the POOL sign.</p>

<p>All these sections stack onto and lift off of one another, so you can see what&#39;s inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong> looks great! The front looks extremely detailed, with the Highlander&#39;s windows and shades, Al&#39;s Barber Shop ( with his shades things; it&#39;s red and white ), and a little alley where you can go between the two. The alley&#39;s steps come off to reveal --- a barrel! But of what? Cookies! Also, there are Sand Yellow and Brown tiles that make the alley look really classy. The sidewalk has a tree, a street lamp, and a newspaper box, which can open so you can get newspapers. Brickman&#39;s place is completely made of mason bricks and windows, so that looks really great, the balconies are made of telescopes and tiles, and the weird thing about The Client&#39;s apartment is that you can see the toilet right through the window. Not much privacy. The third floor has a decorative roof with Hero Factory hands, and The Client&#39;s kitchen.The back&nbsp; is fairly unremarkable, with a small black roof that you can take off and a back door from the Highlander. There&#39;s also a little thing where you open the vent in the back of the building ( the one covered in foliage ), lift up Al&#39;s stairs, open Al&#39;s sink, and take off the alley steps to reveal the cookie barrel. Pretty neat, in my revered opinion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong> is great, because, once again, me pops bought it for us ( me and my siblings).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Playability</strong> is pretty high, but a rated it 4 out of 5 because those of us with sausage-like fingers will have a hard time playing with it. It&#39;s quite cramped, but there are a million scenarios that the kiddies could think up!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Final Opinion</strong>: It&#39;s fantastic! Everything about this set is great! I would wholly recommend it to any FOL with $200 to spare.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! Laters!</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2018-05-12T19:06:57.667Z","A sketchy and substandard part of town","<p>I am pleased to say that I am now a proud owner of 5 modular buildings (yes, I know, 5/13 is still not&nbsp;very impressive). This was delivered to my place not more than a week ago and I started building right after it arrived. I was deciding between the Detective&#39;s Office or 21310 Old Fishing Store, and chose to go ahead with the former. Glad I did because, as good as the fishing store looks, the Detective&#39;s Office is more suitable for a city scene and won&#39;t require me to set aside space for a lake in the (imaginary) city I&#39;m planning on building in the near future. Also, the modular is already 3 years old, so to avoid missing out, now would be a good a time as any to obtain my own copy.</p>

<p>This is the 10th modular building preceded by 10243 Parisian Restaurant and succeeded by 10251 Brick Bank. The build is divided into 4 bags: the pool hall, barber shop, second floor, and third floor plus roof.&nbsp;I spent 4 evenings (one bag per evening) over the week&nbsp;for a total of 8 hours to build this set.</p>

<p>Of greatest emphasis is the backstory included in the set. What we have is a chain of illegal contraband smuggling events taking place in the ghetto parts of a city during a prohibition era and it is up to the detective, and his trusty officer partner, to crack the suspects and make their bust. Many features in this set support the story which will be discussed below.</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp;come out to a total of six and include Ace Brickman the detective, Al the barber, a female officer, a female civilian, and two pool hall patrons, accompanied by a cat.&nbsp;Also included is a minifigure&#39;s cap thrown out in the garbage bin, which you will find out later is someone&#39;s attempt to get rid of a piece of evidence. Accessories include a magnifying glass for the detective, scissors for the barber, money, suitcase, newspapers, envelopes, candies, cookies, and barrel containing the sweets.</p>

<p>The first floor consists of the pool hall on the left and barber shop on the right. The exterior has a newsstand with newspapers, tree, and white lamppost.&nbsp;The pool hall has a brick built pool table, a rack for cues, dart board, darts, trophy case, and coffee table. The pool table is built integrally into the ground so you really can&#39;t take it out as one. On the wall is a 2x2 dark tan tile with star and brick decoration which appeared as the walk of fame tiles in 10232 Palace Cinema. Also mounted on the&nbsp;wall is a ceiling fan whose blades are ingeniously composed of snowshoes. The fan can swivel out of the way to allow easier access to the interior. The barber shop contains a sink, barber&#39;s chair, two window displays for hairpieces, and cabinet. An actual mirror piece is included and mounted on the wall, held in place by railing and guide pieces. The mirror is the same size as a 1x4x6&nbsp;window. A staircase from the alley leads up to the second floor and can swivel to allow access to the cabinet. Why is this important? The biggest play feature of this set is the secret passageway for contraband smuggling. At the back of the barber shop is a weed-covered grate that can be opened up. The cabinet in the barbershop next swings open to allow the contraband to enter. A small door under the staircase then allows the contraband to pass through a hidden tunnel underneath the raised alleyway which can be lifted to reveal the barrel of sweets being smuggled across. A neat little sliding door underneath the trophy cabinet in the pool hall can be opened and the contraband would&#39;ve been&nbsp;successfully transferred from one building to the next. Exterior details of the pool hall include dark green domes nested under the 1x2x6&nbsp;tan arches, stained glass over the entrance, and ball-ended columns surrounding the windows. The barber shop&#39;s exterior features the &quot;AL&#39;S&quot; sign built using clips and plates, red and white awning, scissors mounted beside the lettering, and the barber&#39;s pole to indicate that it is a barber shop. There are two lights in the second floor build which hang above the &quot;AL&#39;S&quot; sign that are built using painters&#39; handles.</p>

<p>The second floor is mostly Ace Brickman&#39;s detective office. In the office are a desk, cabinet, safe, and hat rack. The desk has a desk lamp and paperwork scattered all over, which includes a map, newspaper, and envelope. Inside the cabinet are more envelopes, while the safe has money and a suitcase with evidence inside. On the wall is a wanted poster of the guy who threw away his cap, and a lit painting which swivels out of the way to reveal a hidden compartment containing an important envelope. Through the hallway leading out of the office and beside the staircase is a small bathroom which has a pull chain toilet and an extremely tiny sink, which I&#39;m impressed at considering how little space there is in there. The bathroom is a corner bathroom which is not fully enclosed, making it more of a stall. The 1x4x3 window leads out to the fire exit where there is a working ladder held in place by a lever. The ladder drops partially to ground level but not all the way which is realistic for security reasons. The &quot;POOL&quot; sign is built using red 2x2 corner and 2x2 round tiles with stud hole, and arranged in such a manner as to give off a cartoonish feel.</p>

<p>The top floor is the kitchen where the contraband (sweets) are manufactured. There&#39;s a small table with a mixing bowl for the ingredients, a table of cookies (which the cat is eagerly waiting for to fall to the ground), and a rolling pin mounted on the wall. A door leads outside to the roof. The water tank is built out of 12 tank tread pieces wrapped around a 24-tooth gear. 1x3 brown tiles are simply placed on top of the tank treads. The parapets on both buildings are wonderfully detailed. The left building is apparently decorated with hand pieces used for large scale action figures such as 75525 Baze Malbus&nbsp;and 75533 Boba&nbsp;Fett from the Star Wars theme, while the right building uses four Unikitty&nbsp;tails for decoration. Another fire escape is present, but I feel sorry for whoever has to make that jump to get down to the ladder on the second floor.</p>

<p>All pieces are printed and there are no stickers included. The windows of the pool hall with &quot;The Highlander&quot;, and the detective&#39;s office window with &quot;Ace Brickman&nbsp;Private Detective&quot; written are all printed.</p>

<p>The overall design is visually appealing and captures the New York style architecture very well. The &quot;L&quot; shaped plan of the right building and the difference in heights give&nbsp;the modular depth. The staircase entrance of the barber shop and outward extrusion of the trophy case in the pool hall align with the brown transition building in the floors above which give the impression of continuity even though the alleyway passes through underneath.&nbsp;This means that if you look at the modular head-on the illusion of the brown building &quot;floating&quot; over the alleyway is eliminated. The rear of the building is also very nice to look at with detailing and windows present.&nbsp;I think the colours&nbsp;go great together and actually look friendlier than those given off by the older modulars such as Grand Emporium or Green Grocer. There is no shortage of brick bricks in this set used to build the detective&#39;s office, in fact this is the first time I&#39;ve seen a 1x4 brick brick.</p>

<p>As people elsewhere have pointed out, there was a bit of uncertainty with&nbsp;this modular when it came out. Some found the play features off putting and felt that design and practicality were&nbsp;sacrificed because of it. Many (including myself) claim the right building is very small, being only 10 studs wide, and some found it difficult to fit their hands in. Others found the kitchen entirely out of place because it serves little purpose except to advance the narrative. In my opinion, I appreciate the way this has been done. These types of low-end apartments are supposed to be cramped and unfit for living in. I do find it amazing, though, that the staircase landings are only <em>one</em> stud deep! The apartment can be treated as a condemned living space turned into a crack (cookie) house, which would explain&nbsp;the suspicious, random kitchen. Being located in a tough neighbourhood, I wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;expect anything more comfortable, spacious, or luxurious than what we&#39;ve been given here. With a bit of imagination, we can start understanding why some of the design choices were made, and see how they fit&nbsp;into the environment the designers wanted to simulate.</p>

<p>There is something that I tried to forgive but simply couldn&#39;t: the walls of the pool hall and barber shop facing the alleyway aren&#39;t fully enclosed, they cut off two bricks from the ceiling! Also, the staircase entrance does not have a door either! This leaves the barber shop exposed and poor Al must have to deal with rain, snow, hail, sleet, hot, and cold! From what I gather, the partial walls are to allow easier access into the rooms. Also, the lack of door is probably to allow the staircase to swivel without being blocked. I can see where the designers went ahead with playability and ended up cutting&nbsp;some small corners. Regardless of the reasons, there should be no excuse not to provide full enclosure; since this is a modular building, it should be held to that standard. Luckily, the fixes for fully extending the walls to the roof and adding a door to the staircase entrance is straightforward.</p>

<p>To finally conclude then, why did I give this set a 5? The design and aesthetics is perfect in every other way. The mistake discussed above&nbsp;is not readily apparent and is easily fixed. At $200, I would definitely recommend this modular to accompany the Parisian Restaurant.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-05-13T20:26:43.68Z","A very nice modular - on the inside and in the details.","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>A very nice modular set, different in style from most what has gone before. To me - in looks at least - it looks more than a North American building than a European one. The background story - the pool hall is a Lego &#39;speak easy&#39; - also points in that direction. The building experience was good, though during the build there were a number of things that made me wonder about the decisions made by the designers. The minifigures are well done, and so are the interiors; some of the interiors are rather crammed though, while the detective office in particular is much roomier. As it is, within the modular range I can only compare it to Assembly Square at the moment, which would be an unfair comparison. That said, I see the same attention to detail as in the anniversary set.</p>

<p>To me, one of the surprising decisions was to use the &#39;trap-door-recepticle&#39; (the 6 x 8 stud &#39;ring&#39; in which a trap door is hung) rather than a combination of 1x8 and 1x4 bars. The same goes for the &#39;incomplete&#39; walls of the ground floor along the alley (they are not built to full height). Note also that the backside of Brickman&#39;s office (above the pool hall) is not supported at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good modular, and deserves to be part of any modular collection. IMHO it is well worth its price.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Overall, building this set was good for about 5,5 hours of building fun at a very easy pace. The division of the construction over the bags works well. There are many half-stud-off constructions (recessed windows, much of the upper part if the top floor) that can serve as inspiration for one&#39;s own builds. The construction of the eves is interesting as well. Tne designer did a good job in trying to make the construction of the first and second floor structures different for variety.</p>

<p>Tricky (and something to be careful with) is when building the wall of the pool hall over the passage for the cookies&nbsp;towards the alley, as the overhang is only supported on one side. The pool table as well as the news-paper box were fun little builds.Overall&nbsp;I do not consider the construction&nbsp;as a whole to be difficult.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are 6 minifigures included, plus a very nice cat. Star figures IMHO are Ace Brickman, the detective, and Al the barber. The female police officer is equipped with both a hair piece and a police hat. There is a nice variety in legs, torsos and hair-pieces, that mostly could be swapped around easily to create new characters. There is easily room for a few more characters.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The build is clearly inspired by North American buildings, and the prohibition era - though rather than alcohol it is cakes that are smuggled. The route to smuggle cookies into the pool hall is designed nicely. Overall, the design is well executed, I really like the sign above the barber shop (its construction technique was also used for the comic store of Ninjago City)&nbsp;as well as that for the pool hall. The interiors are very well done, as are the details: they certainly measure up well to best that Assembly Square&nbsp;has to offer. The half-stud off construction works well for the eves as well as the recessed windows. My favourite room is Ace Brickman&#39;s office: the cabinets, the safe, the hidden compartment, luxury chair, the desk, it all gives the impression of a rather disorganized private detective that has come over straight from the movies.</p>

<p>The general colour scheme works well, and I truly like that there is a (near) complete brick facade. The alley leading up to the detective office is a nice touch. This, in combination with the eves, works well to counteract the otherwise bland / cube-like&nbsp;architecture&nbsp;of the block.</p>

<p>The missing upper sections of wall (between the alley and the pool room and barber shop) cannot be seen under normal circumstances. The fire escape from the first floor (working) is a nice touch.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This is clearly a display piece. There are a number of play features, and the various rooms do invite play, but are - unfortunately - difficult to access. Making full use of them means taking off the roof and floors, and moving away the stairs and ceiling-fan. As a display piece it works very well, though I would guess it does not have the general and &#39;easy&#39; appeal that some of the other modular sets do.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>A very nice set that IMHO is in many set apart from the modular range, much like the 2018 diner set. Both seem to be&nbsp;based on North American designs, rather than European ones (as is IMHO pretty much the rest of the&nbsp;modular range). Somewhere it reminds me of something like South Street, Philadelphia, or certain sections of Chicago.</p>

<p>To me, the strength of the set lies in the details and interiors rather than the looks of the exterior: a difference with IMHO pretty much every other set in the modular range.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is this set worth it? IMHO it is. Do I regret buying this set? Definitely not.&nbsp;Would I tell others to get this set over the likes of the Parisian Restaurant or the Brick Bank? Probably not, and I can easily see why people would prefer those over this set.</p>

"Bricksisko","2019-12-19T00:40:47.963Z","One of my Favorites","<p>This is one of my favorite Lego sets (along with the Hogwarts Castle and Roller Coaster). I am a HUGE fan of the Lego modular buildings and buy them every year, so I always have very high expectations for these models. This one definitely did not disappoint.</p>

<p>The overall design of the building with the pool parlor and detectives&#39;s office on the left and the barbershop with an upstairs kitchen on the right is simply amazing. The building fits amazingly with the other modular buildings. The building gives an overall feel of the early 1900&#39;s. The story of this modular that you discover as you build it is also fascinating. I will not spoil it here, but there are some great hidden features that go along with the story in the set. The colors of the set are outstanding. The brick texture on the detective&#39;s office looks stunning. The red &quot;pool&quot; sign also stands out in a good way, elevating the entire build with life. The interior is one of the best out of all the modular buildings. Al&#39;s barbershop is adorable, and the working mirror is a great touch. The mirror is referenced in set 10255 Assembly Square in the ballet studio. The pool table in this set is also a great touch. I think it is an even better build than the pool table in the Ghostbuster&#39;s Headquarters set. The interior of Ace Brickman&#39;s (the detective) office is also outstanding. The coat hangar with a hat on it and the desk are especially stunning. One disapointment of the set comes in the second and third floors of the left side of the building. It feels a little bland. The second floor just acts as a way to get to th kitchen on the thrid floor. the second floor also features a bathroom. The third floor feels a bit bland with just a kitchen, though it is important for the overall story of the set. A few more great parts of this set are the small fire escape in the front and the brown baseplate, which is rather unique. The minifigures are also some of the best of the modular series. I espcecially like their classic faces. Al (barber) and Ace Brickman (detective) are some standout figures. The set includes 6 figures and a cat. Also, the set includes a brick separator (because we all know they are very rare). One other thing I would like to point out is its size. It is a little smaller (height) than the other modulars. It is similar in size to the new bookshop coming out in 2020. I am very hyped for that set!</p>

<p>Overall, I highly recommend this set. It is one of my personal favorites. I am so passionate about this set that I took the time to write a review to recommend this to anyone because I think it will bring you joy! Thanks for reading this review!</p>

"legomandre42082","2018-09-18T00:18:49.153Z","Exceptional Prohibition-era Lego set. ","<h2><strong>Roaring 20&#39;s - Lego version</strong></h2>

<p>This is my third&nbsp;Modular building (Downtown Diner and Parisian Restaurant) and I can honestly say it has been my favorite build out of any set I own. The one aspect of the set that caught my eye was the time period in which it was set in, Prohibition Era. I am no US historian, but this is the one era that I have been fascinated around. The Lego designers did a magnificent job with hiding intricate details throughout the model, while making it appropriate for younger kids. It feels as though the designers took the ime with this building to encapsulate one of the most vibrant and influential eras in US history.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>&nbsp;<b>What I enjoyed about the set</b></h2>

<ul>
	<li>While building this impressive model, I found the techniques that the designers used to make the model most amazing. For example, when constructing the first floor, they incorporated a sliding door in the Pool Hall and Barbershop, in order to smuggle in those tasty and illegal treats, which I found was really fun to build. It was also nice that they separated the first two stores in different bags, so the builder could appreciate the detail of each building.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The various characters on display truly brought out the story of the establishment. The conspicuous characters in the Pool Hall wanted nothing more than to obtain those mysterious treats, but the Detective upstairs knows something has been going down beneath him. While getting his monthly haircut across the alleyway, a gorgeous lady mentions that somebody has been sneaking into her apartment every once and a while. He brings her up to his office, where he tries not break his silence on the crush he had on her. While that happens, her boyfriend is making the treats and putting it in the barrel underneath the alley. The storylines are endless with this scene.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The only negative I had about the set, and why I gave it a 3 for playability, was the amount of space to play move the figures around in. I found it very difficult to place my figures in various positions, which deterred from the likelihood of every fully playing with the set. I would have like to have the structure without the alley, to allow for a larger space to play with the magnificent&nbsp;building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Would I recommend this set?</b></h2>

<p>With the feedback given above, I would highly recommend building and enjoying this impressive structure. I spent quality time to reminisce on this era and notice all the details that the designers added. This set is more than a play set, it is a display piece. I have it at my house sitting on a platform in my living room, for all to bask in the glory of the best modular building. Though the set is three years old, the techniques have been used throughout the ages.&nbsp;</p>

"Tre1awny","2021-02-05T19:13:27.603Z","The start of an obsession","<p>The detective&#39;s office was my very first Modular building I remember gawking at it after it was revealed in the LEGO catalogue 3 years later just before it was retiring I had saved up enough money from Christmas and birthday to get it. Boy am I glad I did this set is utterly amazing.</p>

<p>The build: this being my first big set the building process was quite long though of course it was fun, definitely some interesting techniques such as the hero factory hands as roof decor for the detective&#39;s office and the small build of a newspaper dispenser.</p>

<p>The minifigs: this being a creator Modular (pre-2018) the figures are relatively simple though there are some uncommon torso designs here and there and of course each figure has the same classic smiley.</p>

<p>Play/Display: the play value in this set really does depend on what sort of person you are. There is an astounding feature included in this set based on the prohibition (though in this case what would be alcohol is replaced with candy). Of course though this series is aimed at adults over children and I can happily say this is an excellent display by itself or accompanied by other modulars.</p>

<p>The negatives: as is the case with most straight modulars this set is ugly from the sides though of course this is fine as it not meant to be viewed this way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary: this set is an excellent Modular and still my favourite to this day (could be nostalgia). Superb display piece especially accompanied by #10264 corner garage. Unfortunately this set is now long retired in 2021 and is going for around &pound;200 ($270) on ebay&nbsp;</p>
