Anyways&nbsp;having bought this the day I discovered it online I was overwhelmingly filled with joy upon opening it after picking it up from a local Target since it is a store exclusive. At first glance it would seem that only one figure is exclusive (Superboy), but I have never seen this city forest police ranger before, so I believe that there are two exclusive figures in this set but I&#39;m only positive that Superboy has new printing&nbsp;designed for his minifigure.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The quality of the&nbsp;packaging is actually very good. the box is very solid thanks to the removable&nbsp;plastic mold inside keeping all of the&nbsp;figures in place. The only problem with this set is the plastic&nbsp;mold folds the red cape on the Legends of Chima&nbsp;minifigure, but that wasn&#39;t a huge concern for me since I personally only bought it for Superboy. No instructions were included which isn&#39;t a huge suprise&nbsp;since the minifigures were already built, but it is something to note.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>All the figures come pre-assembled, with only the Chima figure holding anything&nbsp;in his hand. extra parts to equip the figures with a buildable flashlight, handcuffs, and a Chima sword in a sealed package at the very top when you open the box.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Superboy/Kon-El- Superboy is a genetically&nbsp;engineered clone of Superman&#39;s future son Jon Lane Kent that&nbsp;has abilities similar to that of Superman. This is the first time he has appeared in a physical Lego form, having also recently appeared in Lego Batman&nbsp;3, although I believe he is wearing a different outfit in the game than he is here. He comes with some dark blue pants with printed pockets and belt.His torso is&nbsp;a black t-shirt with printed abs, has a red Superman logo on it, and even includes&nbsp;short black sleeves&nbsp;on the figures arms. His face has two expressions, one with a serious attitude and another&nbsp;with him&nbsp;angry, having&nbsp;his mouth open showing his clenched teeth and&nbsp;his eyes glowing red since&nbsp;he can shoot lasers from them.</p>

<p>Green Ninja- this is the Lloyd Dx version of the green ninja that was released a couple years back. there isn&#39;t anything new about him but it is nice to have him since I did not have him before and now he can go with my Lego Movie sets.</p>

<p>Lavertus- Despite&nbsp;his wrinkled cape, Lavertus is a very nice figure that has&nbsp;quite a lot of printing on his torso (including his back) and legs. Lego has really&nbsp;put a lot of detail into these Legend of Chima&nbsp;minifigures and it really shows by their ability to print very tiny details&nbsp;on ridged head molds such as this one.</p>

<p>Forest Police- A pretty decent figure. He&#39;s got his shades hanging from the top button of his shirt , and a vest on top with his badge and radio connected on each side. On the back of his torso is print labeling him as Police, and has the wire from his radio connecting from the top down to his buckle.I really like the figures hat, even though it&#39;s not new (I personally haven&#39;t bought a set including it) I think it is a great accessory.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Just the accessories needed any assembly, so there wasn&#39;t much of a build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Four minifigures on four grey 4x3 minifigure base&nbsp;plates.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re a Superman or Teen Titans fan this is a must buy and even if you&#39;re not this is still a great set of figures. For the fifteen dollars retail price that I paid I&#39;d say this was most certainly worth the money.&nbsp;</p>

"8BrickMario","2014-12-10T19:03:19.98Z","Exclusive figures in a small set? Yes!","<p>This was an odd set that no one was expecting. But it includes a desirable new character, and some nice new variations of previous characters, so I decided to get it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The cube shaped box is interesting enough, with clear windows to the minifigures, and backgrounds depicting the themes they&#39;re from. The minifigs are held by a black plastic ring with four indentations to hold the minifigures and plates. Inside the hollow of the ring, Lavertus&#39;s sword parts and the policeman&#39;s accessory pieces are in a plastic bag, along with some very brief instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too special or new, but the most notable thing is the four minifigure stands in light gray, which previously only appeared in the Ghostbusters set, with only one.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All four minifigures are exclusive.</p>

<p>Lloyd DX: Lloyd Garmadon&nbsp;was not present or old enough&nbsp;during the wave the DX outfits were used, and so he gets the outfit retroactively here. He has his typical hood and shoulder armor/sword holder, though. His face has a silly smirk.</p>

<p>Fire Lavertus is also new, with a variation of the torso print. His mask and head are the same, and he comes with the double-sided Chima hilt with the new flame blade. He also has a Fire CHI crystal. His cape is dark red, but the box completely disorts it, reducing its appearance and usefulness.</p>

<p>The Swamp Police Officer is a preview for the Swamp Police theme next year. He has a new face, a new color for the Forest Police hat. He has a flashlight constructed from a black lightsaber&nbsp;hilt and a trans-yellow stud, although the box shows a telescope instead of the lightsaber hilt. He also has a pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p>The most anticipated figure is Superboy, who is completely new and well made. His head is serious on one side, and has red eyes to represent heat vision and an angry expression on the other side. His hair is nothing special. His torso has dual-molded arms, for the first time with a flesh color, and his outfit is the T-shirt and jeans from&nbsp;<em>Young Justice</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not much of a build here at all, the figs are pre-assembled, and the accessories are very simple.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;m pleased. We get two new characters and two exclusive variations. Being a DC nut, I needed to get Superboy, but the other figures are very nice.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you can find this set, get it! It has something for fans of City, Ninjago, DC Super Heroes, and Chima.&nbsp;</p>
