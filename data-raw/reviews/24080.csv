So, I&nbsp;looked at the useful landscape colours,&nbsp;saw a couple of new and interesting&nbsp;parts poking out and convinced myself that I wanted it. I&#39;m glad I did because it&#39;s a surprisingly good&nbsp;set even for someone not into Chima.</p>

<p>From a MOCer&#39;s point of view I suggest you look at the parts list as there is&nbsp;interesting, new and unusual stuff included in this set. I also suggest you look at a download of the instructions as there&#39;s some interesting&nbsp;techniques.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I built the model and it was a really enjoyable&nbsp;process. It has the feel of a very well designed set by someone that really knows their stuff. It includes a&nbsp;little of everything from organic looking&nbsp;shaping to&nbsp;a Technic mechanism. A highlight for me was the engines&nbsp;where half is built upside down and then locked in place with other parts over the top. With the plethora&nbsp;of snot parts around now making thing easy, it&#39;s an old school&nbsp;technique I needed reminding of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minfigs are beautifully ornate. Maybe not too useful for anything other than Chima (other than the wings maybe), but you&#39;ve got to love the ludicrously&nbsp;sized&nbsp;weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability wise very swooshable and the tail and head come off to create a small fleet. My seven year old loved it and we had some great games,&nbsp;before I took it back for parts like the&nbsp;evil Lego hoarding parent I am.</p>

It doesn&#39;t feature any of the most well-known characters, and the vulture tribe are the ugliest&nbsp;antagonists in the Fire vs Ice subtheme. At the $40 price point, you could get Cragger&#39;s Fire Striker or Eris&#39; Fire Eagle Flyer, which are both perfectly good&nbsp;sets featuring characters who play prominent roles throughout the theme. Despite all of that, purely from a Lego standpoint, this is perhaps the best $40 set in the theme...so let me explain to you why!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box shows a&nbsp;perfectly accurate depiction of the finished product, but it does leave out the fact that Vardy&nbsp;sits on a 360 degree rotating platform.</p>

<p>You get two instruction booklets. One person can work on the minifigures, Frax&#39;s vehicle, and the Vulture head. The other person can work on the body and wings. The only negative thing&nbsp;I can say about the instructions is that there were a couple steps where the round studs pictured in the book varied significantly in color from the studs I was provided. Otherwise it was the quality you expect from the Lego Group.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Excellent parts, some of which I hadn&#39;t seen before. This is a set which focuses heavily on small details rather than creating a huge construction. A majority of the pieces have some decorative or functional purpose.&nbsp;The wings move with a gear system, which involves a lot of technic. Frax&#39;s tiny vehicle does use some of the cool fire pieces that I&#39;ve only personally seen in Chima. If you like to buy these sets for their parts, definitely have a look at what&#39;s in this one.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is probably the low point of the set because the vulture tribe is kind of ugly, but there are plenty of positives to mention.&nbsp;Vultrix herself is exclusive to this set, and I don&#39;t think any other vulture has her color scheme. This is the only major set that features&nbsp;Frax the phoenix, and his orange headpiece is unique in his tribe. Vardy isn&#39;t exactly in a lot of sets, although he looks a heck of a lot like Vornon, so he is forgettable. He does get a giant gun, though, which actually serves as the rear turret on the vehicle. I thought it was fun that the gun he holds in his hand was being used as an important accessory for&nbsp;the vehicle, and not just tacked onto a holder somewhere, or awkwardly stuffed with him into his cockpit.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are four bags. The&nbsp;first two are pretty basic stuff:&nbsp;&nbsp;just&nbsp;minifigures and small vehicle constructions. All of a sudden bag 3 hits you with some incredible building techniques and technic madness. Bag 3 is one of the most memorable steps&nbsp;of any build I&#39;ve done. You use a technique to attach the lower half of the &quot;engine&quot; upside down by clamping it down rather than pushing it into any studs. It works beautifully. You also build a gear system that flaps both wings in sync, and it&#39;s unlike any gear build I&#39;ve done. It felt like a master Lego architect wanted to educate&nbsp;me on some seldom-seen techniques. I loved it. Bag 4 was pretty ordinary, but bag 3 really made the build. Nothing more needed to be done to make this awesome.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a 480 piece set, you might have expected the Sky Scavenger to be a bit bigger, but everything is packed with details and embellishments. (and stickers galore, unfortunately, but they look good)</p>

<p>I like the range of motion on the wings. They can flap in about a&nbsp;130 degree arc, and can almost go parallel to each other at the top. The mechanism to flap them is under the vehicle&#39;s back side, so it&#39;s easy to use while you&#39;re pretending it&#39;s flying.</p>

<p>Sorry to repeat myself a bit, but I was happy with Vardy&#39;s platform that lets him spin 360 degrees so he can shoot things down with his absurdly huge gun.</p>

<p>Frax&#39;s vehicle is okay for the small number of pieces it used. You can stick it inside the Flying Phoenix Fire Temple and it looks perfectly at home.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also detach the head and Vardy, although I don&#39;t like to do this, I&#39;m sure kids would like it more than I do.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like most Chima sets, so if you pass up on the Sky Scavenger for another set, I can&#39;t really blame you. The alternatives are certainly good. However, this set is an excellent&nbsp;value, and a lot of fun to play with. You get&nbsp;480 pieces for $40 MSRP&nbsp;- hard to beat that even if it&#39;s a lot of small parts. It has a memorable&nbsp;build, and great functionality and play potential.</p>
