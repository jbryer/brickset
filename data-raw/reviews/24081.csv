"A_Brickset_user","2015-01-18T18:48:52.43Z","A Solid Fighter","<p>I found this LEGO Star Wars polybag set the 17th&nbsp;January 2015 in the Bilka Store, Fields in Denmark. I was suprised to see it here together with the polybag version of the new AT-DP&nbsp;(30274), so I picked them both up for a price of 29.00 DKK&nbsp;($ 4.92) each.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
This small set comes in a polybag. The polybag is a single bag itself and does not include any other bags. All pieces and the instructions are include in the bag.<br />
The layout of the polybag is the standard 2015 Star Wars Rebels. The A-Wing itself (+ space, laser and explosions)&nbsp;take up the most space on the front, including; age, number and name - and the new Disney logo (far right, lower corner).<br />
The instructions is a single sheet with printing on both the sides - and is folded to fit in the polybag.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
The whole model includes 58 pieces and 3 spare parts.<br />
Overall these pieces are decently good with most use in white and dark red colours.&nbsp;I&nbsp;notably&nbsp;think that black clip pieces used to hold the blasters are good &quot;new&quot; bricks.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
This small model is the only thing&nbsp;included in the set.<br />
No minifigures are included in this set.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong><br />
Simple and quick build. The blasters do click nicely into the holders.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong><br />
From the piece count it does look really nice.&nbsp;No use of stickers. Solid construction.&nbsp;But actually it does not look like an A-Wing that much, especially the front.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
Overall I think that this set is worth the &quot;try&quot;, since the price is pretty low.<br />
Regular polybag. Good parts. Easy build.<br />
Last I will just mention that the playability with this&nbsp;fighter is very great, because it is so; Small, lightweight and has a solid build with absolute no wobbling parts.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-04T18:16:13.527Z","Great Addition to Polybag Ships from LEGO Star Wars","<p><strong>Set #30272 A-Wing Starfighter:</strong> This is a very nice addition to the Star Wars Polybag ship series of sets. We&rsquo;ll cover all of the pros and cons in the set and then give you my final opinion, as an aside this set was made available in Canada through Costco and a special 3-1 DK Publishing book pack with a few Star Wars Sticker Books and an excerpt of pages from one of the larger books, I believe the Visual Dictionary, but I could be mistaken.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model captures the aesthetics of the Starfighter adequately, it looks great and is great fun to play with. The colouring is not what I remember from Return of the Jedi, but it does look good with the dark maroon and white pieces.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Instructions are easy to follow.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price-per-piece ratio is fine.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Limited availability hinders the access for many to getting this set. Unless you live in the States you can&rsquo;t find it on store shelves, so building a small army of A-Wing Fighters for fans of such options is difficult and costly.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>As a bonus with the LEGO DK Books from Costco this is a nice, fun little additional build that fans and kids can enjoy. Finding it in stores in your area will no doubt be difficult, however I wholeheartedly recommend picking this polybag up. LEGO Star Wars Polybags are often very well designed and their prices are great. Some of them are weaker than others, but this vehicle from the Rebellion isn&rsquo;t one of them. Great set overall.</p>
