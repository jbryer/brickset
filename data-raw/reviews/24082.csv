<p>This comes in the regular-size polybag with a 12 step instruction sheet (dubble-sided print).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a small ball-joint to cross axle piece included which is a handy little piece.<br />
Also included are a some ratchet-connecting 1x2 plates.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly easy for any age but I found it to be really entertaining for the small size.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model may not be a perfect replica of the bigger size AT-DP (75083) but it is a good mini-build and it is really well pose able&nbsp;for its size.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would definitely recommend&nbsp;getting one of these if they are at the retail price !</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p><span class=""scayt-misspell-word"">Polybag</span>, nothing special.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>From what I know there aren&#39;t any rare parts in this set, but you also don&#39;t buy sets like this for parts.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Less than 5 minutes. Some interesting&nbsp;techniques, but overall, very straightforward.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks very good. Resembles very well AT-DP from the show, only inconsistency is the angling of the &quot;eyes&quot;, though it&#39;s pretty&nbsp;much impossible to make it&nbsp;in this scale, so I&#39;ll let it pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s legs can move, so you can pose it in walking poses, unlike the big one. Cannon also can&nbsp;be pointed in many directions, it&#39;s on a tiny ball joint.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love it. It&#39;s great as a&nbsp;toy, and as a mini model for your desk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>pros:</p>

<p>Accurate to the show</p>

<p>Moving legs (!)</p>

<p>cons:</p>

<p>none</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T02:05:05.59Z","Rebels Polybag Fun Mini-Build","<p><strong>Set #30274 AT-DP:</strong> The polybags from Star Wars in 2015 are mostly all Rebels based and these little puppies look pretty impressive. This one is a real treat and the reasons why it&rsquo;s so good outweigh any potential issues it may have. Let&rsquo;s go on to the pros and cons of this set.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Instructions work great for this little polybag and the packaging is a real treat, this is one polybag I wouldn&rsquo;t mind having an extra sealed just because of the overall design of it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This vehicle is a really impressive vehicle, it&rsquo;s different enough from the AT-ST that while it does have similarities the overall design is an awesome looking one and this miniature build captures the look of this vehicle perfectly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The use of a miniature ball and socket joint for the cannon is perfect, a great use of those parts and I&rsquo;d love to see them incorporate this into future polybag designs, especially if we get a new AT-AT in the next few years.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Like with most walkers at this scale I&rsquo;m not a fan of the leg joints, these things allow for limited looking poses which is unfortunate. Of course these are walkers, and being super articulated isn&rsquo;t necessarily a requirement.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>I&rsquo;m beginning to wish LEGO would include Minifigures in these polybags. This set would have made for an excellent place to include an AT-DP pilot or Agent Callus in a cheaper set. Unfortunately most polybags of this nature are used to build micro scaled vehicles.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend this set to every fan of the Rebels franchise. It would make a great little build for forced perspective shots in stop-motions and it does serve as a great little parts pack. I also really dig the look of the packaging for this polybag and it&rsquo;s a great addition to the Star Wars polybags you&rsquo;ve been collecting.</p>

"vikings","2017-03-11T21:27:05.603Z","Nice Mini Walker ","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong>The mini AT-DP comes in a polybag. All it shows is just the walker on the front of the bag. The instructions are small like they are usually with polybags so nothing special.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong>There aren&#39;t any parts in this set that you don&#39;t get really in any other set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>The build was quick and easy. It took me under 5 minutes to complete. The only thing about the build was the technique used on the side armor of the walker.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong>Not much I can say since it&#39;s a polybag except how nicely it resembles the real one. The legs are nice and keeps it from falling over, which is really nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>Overall it is a really nice cheap 4 dollar walker to get especially since it resembles the larger scale one pretty well. The cannon on the front is really nice. Easy to play with for those who want it for that and good for displaying as well for those who want it for that. Overall I give it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Boats75","2016-07-06T21:23:19.523Z","Cool little build with multiple uses","<p>This is my first review on Brickset so part of it might be bland. With that said, my son and I are huge fans of the Rebels cartoon and have almost all the sets from the show except a few special promotional ones. I saw these in a bin at Legoland Chicago and decided to grab one. All things considered I wish I got 2, I&#39;ll explain that below.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing exciting, poly bag and simple instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As a few other reviews have stated, &nbsp;no really unique parts but.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really simple build but some neat techniques.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like the model overall and think it represents the AT-DP as best as it can in this scale. For playability it does pretty well. If&nbsp;you&#39;ve seen the entire series you might remember a scene (maybe it happened a few times)&nbsp;when an Imperial Assault Carrier drops off 2 AT-DPs that are hanging underneath it instead of TIE fighters. Although I&#39;m sure it was completely unintended the single stud on top allows you to attach this to the bottom of the Lego Assault Carrier. &nbsp;I said earlier I wish I had 2 so I could recreate this when my son and I are playing. &nbsp;I don&#39;t build dioramas but I&#39;m sure these could work into one easily to represent a walker in the distance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, great value for playability or if you collect Rebels sets. The only con is I wish it pivoted in the middle but I realize that&#39;s hard to do in something this scale.</p>
