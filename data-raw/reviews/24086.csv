We&rsquo;ll discuss the pros and cons of this polybag and then summarize.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Simple elegant model design is a brilliant use of parts to create a brilliant model for Heartlake City.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Olivia has nice dark colour selection with a dark purple top with flower print and dark blue cargo pants.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Smoothie blender mini-model is satisfying and functional.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Piece count is minimal and costs of polybags have risen in Canada making this a very unfortunate price-per-piece ratio. (Now 6$ in Canada for Polybags.)</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Models colours are rather bland, with only two teal plates and a larger orange plate. Fans of Friends and the colourful nature of the sets may find this disappointing.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>As polybags go this is a nice little set and really worthy of being picked up. The inclusion of a banana and apple piece to make decent fruit smoothies, whipped topping canister and blending machine mini-models are included here to terrific effect. The only real issues I have with this set is the cost increase at TRU in Canada for the polybags and the lack of truly colourful piece selection. Definitely recommended.</p>
