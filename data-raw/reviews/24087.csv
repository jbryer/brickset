<p>Pieces: 39</p>

<p>Release Year: 2015</p>

<p>Price: US $3.99</p>

<h3><u><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></u></h3>

<p>This set comes in the standard poly bag that LEGO has used for awhile now. The front shows IceKlaw in his mech with some chi nearby.</p>

<p>The instructions are just like other polybag instructions, small and folded up. They have great rendered images and are easy to understand for any level of builder.</p>

<p>Overall: 4/5 Just as I expected.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Parts</strong></u></h3>

<p>The parts selection here is actually very good considering it is a polybag with only 39 total parts. The set has some of the new ball joint clasps for the legs which are great for any MOC. The set also come with two sets each of new claws for the hand and feet claws. The &quot;spider legs&quot; that make the cockpit are also only seen in silver in one other set.</p>

<p>Overall: 5/5 Great parts selection for a polybag.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Minifigures</strong></u></h3>

<p>Surprisingly IceKlaw for this set wont be necessarily the draw for everyone, but for me it was.</p>

<p>IceKlaw: Shows up only in this set! That is a unique minifigure in a polybag. This doesn&#39;t happen to often which means the value for this set goes up alot. I love the detail on him, he has some great blue/gray writing on him that really makes him stand out. He also gets a trans-light blue right leg. Truly a great and detailed figure to add to any collection.</p>

<p>Overall: 5/5 A unique minifigure is one that I take note of and to have him in a polybag is truly special.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Build</strong></u></h3>

<p>The build is over as quickly as it starts, but what do you expect, you bought a polybag set with 39 pieces.</p>

<p>Overall: 3/5 fast easy, nothing new in the means of building styles.</p>

<h3><u><strong>The Completed Model</strong></u></h3>

<p>The finished model is actually very good looking. With the limited amount of pieces available a desirable mech was created. Yeah, it doesn&#39;t have great poseability or movement, but it uses 39 pieces. It looks great.</p>

<p>Overall: 5/5 For how many pieces it uses, it make a great looking mech that could do some damage.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Price</strong></u></h3>

<p>Price for this set is US $3.99. Piece count is 39 with 1 minifigure.</p>

<p>Price-per-piece: $0.102. This is over my typical $0.10 benchmark I hold for all LEGO sets but we must realize that this set is a poly bag and doesn&#39;t apply to the standard I set for most of the other LEGO sets.</p>

<p>Counting in Minifigures: One Minifigure at four pieces (head, helmet, torso, and legs). I count a minifigure at $3.00. Thus the rest of the set would come out to $0.99 at 25 pieces. Price-per-piece: $0.04 which is superb. But this ratio is found in all minifigure based polybag sets.</p>

<p>Overall: 5/5 It&#39;s a poly bag, but it is one of the best value for price polybags that I have seen of late.</p>

<h3><u><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></u></h3>

<p>A simple set that has a great selection of pieces with a great minifigure that is only in this set.</p>

<p>Overall: 5/5 Another hit for the Chima line and it is only $3.99. Great set to spend a little money on to get a great minifigure and pieces.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-13T18:12:49.69Z","Iceklaw's Deadly Little Mech.","<p><strong>Set #30256 Ice Bear Mech:</strong> As polybags go this one isn&rsquo;t half bad, it has a unique Minifigure and an interesting use of parts for the build. Let&rsquo;s go over the pros and cons.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Mech build is an impressive little model that uses SNOT techniques. There are no visible studs anywhere, even the pilot&rsquo;s area uses smooth tiles instead of studed ones. Minor exception being transparent blue piece, studs are still visible beneath it.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Iceklaw Minifigure unique to the set. Includes impressive printing with double-sided torso, transparent leg with leg printing, single sided face print with back printing, bear helmet piece with printing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Decent value for price.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>SNOT build technique prevents Minifigure from attaching to model when in pilot&rsquo;s seat.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No accessories for Iceklaw, just yet another CHI crystal.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>As polybags go this isn&rsquo;t too bad and I strongly recommend tracking one down, more than one if you&rsquo;d like a small army. The Ice Bear Mech is an impressive little model with some intriguing design choices, the use of bone pieces for the canopy section is neat and the colours of the pieces in the set really stand out.</p>
