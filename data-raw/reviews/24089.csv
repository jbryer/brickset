","<p>Fans of modular buildings have been eagerly awaiting the 1st of January for the past few years, and not just because it&#39;s an excuse to stay in bed nursing any afflictions that one may have acquired the night before. No, the first day of the new year is when TLG decides to allow the general public to get a taste of the latest modular - which, as many will undoubtedly already know, is Detective&#39;s Office (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10246-1/Detective-s-Office"">10246</a>) for 2015. A juicy new modular building is generally more than enough for any AFOL&nbsp;to race down to his or her local store or to the LEGO Shop@home website, but for uninitiated, dropping close to US$200 on toys can seem like a harrowing experience - so what better way to sweeten the deal than with a small freebie?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The City-style promotional&nbsp;polybags&nbsp;have been a real boon (or a source of endless frustration) for the avid collector because they&#39;ve replaced a niche that seems to have vanished entirely - the sub-$10 impulse buy exemplified by sets like BBQ Stand (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8398-1/BBQ-Stand"">8398</a>) and the like. I was previously enamoured by the aforementioned&#39;s successor, the Hot Dog Stand (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40078-1/Hot-Dog-Stand"">40078</a>), that was introduced in the month that Orthanc (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10237-1/Tower-of-Orthanc"">10237</a>) was released, and I didn&#39;t think that it would be possible to put a fresh spin on sets that are so small, but it&#39;s happened. Those mad geniuses at TLG have done it.</p>

<p>Now, why did I bring up Detective&#39;s Office in the first place? There are many easy ways to rack up over $75 in purchases on LEGO, and the annual modular is certainly one of them. At first glance, the seemingly innocuous Flower Cart seems to have nothing to do with that, but cursory examination reveals that the polybag comes with a barrel of cookies - and if you&#39;ve done nothing but watch the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpshhxplgAU"">official Designer video</a> for Detective&#39;s Office, you&#39;ll know that the primary scenario there is that crooks are attempting to sneak cookies past the fun police. And wouldn&#39;t you know it? There is a spot beneath the flower cart where the aspiring smuggler can stash the barrel, away from the interfering&nbsp;eyes of LEGO City&#39;s draconian&nbsp;police force.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What this basically means is that if you&#39;re on the fence about picking up Detective&#39;s Office, Flower Cart is a great (if insidious) motivating factor to do so since it basically acts as a freebie &quot;expansion pack&quot; for an already great set. In any case, it&#39;s a pretty cute build that can be replicated quite easily, and the flowers can easily be swapped out for produce/pastries/anything your city needs. Yeah, it&#39;s real nice. But, on the other hand, if you have next to no interest in City or Detective&#39;s Office, is this polybag good for you? Free parts are always nice, but I reckon this small set might be understandably boring if you have nothing else to pair it with. There&#39;s nothing particularly rare here save for the red bucket which I haven&#39;t seen before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m always a fan of small sets that synergise with big ones, and Flower Cart certainly does that. It&#39;s a great idea for any city and, as mentioned, pairs well with the Detective&#39;s Office and the criminals housed within. TLG, you make me happy and my bank account sad. Good work.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-01T23:15:07.923Z","Wonderful Free Item.","<p><strong>Set #40140 Flower Cart: </strong>When it comes to polybags you never know what to expect. Case in point here&rsquo;s a nice little set that is intended to be a companion to the Modular Detective Agency. Read on to find out the pros and cons of this set, which was given away for free at January on the LEGO Shop@Home site in 2015.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Solidly built flower cart model, similar models sometimes use too few pieces and the cart comes out too small, as evidenced by some of the Friends polybags with carts for selling stuff. This model is large enough that it works and includes four flower bouquets for sale.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The design is pretty impressive, the awning looks great.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Flower Cart Salesman is an awesome minifigure. With a nice double-sided torso print. Not new, we&rsquo;ve seen it in the past, but it&rsquo;s a great looking torso. He includes a red bucket, a broom and a shovel for gardening stuff I guess. The head is classic yellow faced LEGO minifig with the simple little smile and solid black dots, a great look for this set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Play feature, the flower cart includes a hidden cookie barrel, keeping the tone of the thematic story for the detective agency. This is odd if you don&rsquo;t pick up the modular, but it&rsquo;s a nice touch and much appreciated.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>What can I say? Even the price per piece ratio can&rsquo;t be a con with this set because it was free, unless you missed out on it, then the secondary market prices might get a bit too high. Honestly this is a good solid polybag with no real flaws.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Highly recommended. Even if you aren&rsquo;t getting the Modular Detective Agency this is a nice solid little polybag, with a great overall design and an interesting minifigure to add to your LEGO City/Town display. If you passed up the opportunity to own this one, you definitely will be kicking yourself. The only options now would be to hope for another release from LEGO or go to the secondary market and pick it up.</p>
