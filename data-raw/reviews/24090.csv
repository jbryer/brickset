Food carts, miniature vehicles, various scenes of spring and summer time activities that the Friends can have fun doing. (Winter is mostly saved for the Advent Calendars and Fall&hellip;would be nice to see.) This is a nice fun activity that many people enjoy during the late spring and summer. Playing mini-golf. Is this a good polybag though? Read on and find out.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is a nice hole for a MOC mini-golf court. Build is fast, mostly plates used here, and the windmill obstacle is a clever use of the steering wheel piece with a few other parts to make a small bridge with windmill building on top.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Includes a nice pink flag piece.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Emma mini-doll included, features awesome printed torso and lovely new colour scheme for the lower torso skirt piece. A sort of olive green, light in tone, very nice unique colour for her or other mini-dolls.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Brick built golf club accessory, one short grey rod and a c-clip for the putter part.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Would prefer a new sculpt accessory piece for the golf club.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Only one hole for typically a sixteen or eighteen hole course. Good starter pack, but not a full course for Heartlake City.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Not many pieces.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I love the theme of this polybag more than the piece count or actual build indicates. For a freebie it isn&rsquo;t bad, and I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this because I just love that colour on Emma&rsquo;s skirt and it makes for a good bargain. The brick-built golf club is kind of clever and the grey rod is nice to see in this set&hellip; I&rsquo;m not 100% sure, but I believe it&rsquo;s a different colour for the pieces found in most Ninjago sets for some of the weapons. If you got this as a free add-on during the LEGO S&amp;H event than great, if you&rsquo;re looking for it on the secondary market I&rsquo;d say try to find it for under 10$ because the piece count doesn&rsquo;t justify high secondary market prices.</p>
