<p>Polybag. Instructions for the car on the bag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>43 + 3 spares. I do not know if any of the parts are rare.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Basic</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set if you need a quick LEGO fix. With only 43 bricks, it is fast to whip up a new car version. Or something else. And you can have it with you everywhere. Test your imagination. Plus, it is cheap.</p>

"FlyerBeast","2015-05-19T18:08:29.71Z","Simple, Solid, Satisfactory, Suitable for modding","<p>I picked this tiny polybag set up with the Daily Mail promotion in May 2015, and was surprised not to see a wave of reviews appearing here on Brickset soon after. Maybe it&#39;s been ignored mostly because it&#39;s neither licensed nor includes a minifig, but this was instantly my favourite when I saw the images for this year&#39;s polybags. I&#39;ll try to explain here why this set is worth getting your hands on, if you have the relevant interests.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set is packaged in a polybag with a simplistic but attractive front displaying the car in an offroad desert-type location and a back mostly taken up by the usual health hazard signs. The tiny instructions leaflet is cute and is not cluttered with advertising, other than for the Lego Club. There&#39;re no part callouts or inventory pages, as per usual in promo sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s mostly a basic selection of the obvious mini car parts (Ancient mudguard pieces, SNOTty plates, generic plates, trans studs and spares) in a very common shade of yellow, so as a source of parts for anything other than a car, it&#39;s not a very interesting set. Despite that, this is a great set for its four quite recent <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6029209"">wheels</a> (in grey) and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6029208"">tyres</a>, which have not previously appeared in any sets this cheap. I find these wheels much more realistic than the alternative and they work great on minifig-scaled vehicles too. The dark trans windscreen is a nice addition too, as it&#39;s appeared <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4198311"">in surprisingly few sets</a>. Note the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6071226"">new-styled 1x1 upright clips</a>, which are now commonplace anyway, not sure why I was excited to see them. The included spares are one grey tap, a trans red stud and a trans stud, nothing amazing. A 4x4 yellow plate is quite a substantial inclusion, odd for a promo set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None, nor are there any parts that could be particularly useful while building minifigures unless you&#39;re after the three &#39;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6029208"">taps</a>&#39;.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build would take roughly 5 minutes if you were deliberately savouring the process like I did. It&#39;s neither repetitive or challenging, but is not disappointing because this is a polybag, what&#39;d you expect? Though some promo sets have utilised some interesting uses of parts, this is fairly rote but nonetheless satisfying. This is one of the sets I like to memorise the build for and be able to take on holiday with me, but that&#39;s unimportant.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The car comes off looking similar to a <a href=""http://independent.md/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/5b33bec1ed345baa883222eb791d1711.jpg"">military truck</a>, with its flat bonnet, perpendicular windscreen and sloped boot, but that&#39;s probably mostly because I have little knowledge of cars. The two taps on the roof either represent floodlights or horns, and help to add to the overall &#39;rugged&#39; look. Perhaps the wheels appear too large on the vehicle, giving it the appearance more of a monster truck than of a 4x4, but the realistic detailing on these wheels makes up for it aesthetically and functionally.</p>

<p>Every detail you&#39;d hope to see on a Lego car at this scale is present and correct, with front and rear lights, grilles and even a very crude tow cable reel (?), though one glaring problem is the lack of any seats or interior. This does not affect its playability much though. The rear of the car is perhaps a little lacking, perhaps as there could have been a second 2x1 trans brick placed in the rear window, though this is no matter. The ground clearance is a lot better than several recent 4x4 sets, namely the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75916-1/Dilophosaurus-Ambush"">Jurassic World jeep</a> practically scraping the ground. This one really does feel as if it could scale a mountain. It includes most of the parts you&#39;d need to build a car, and has a surprising amount of possibilities for modding, due to the inclusion of both male and female hinge parts and SNOT plates.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As a vehicle this looks like a decent small set. Playability, though obviously limited, is good enough for a car set and gets no complaints from me. At the good price point I got the set at it&#39;s a great deal, especially for those new and still sort-of rare wheels. It works as part of a collection of miniature Creator vehicles, such as <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7602-1/Black-SUV"">other</a> <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7803-1/Jeep"">similarly</a> <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30183-1/Little-Car"">scaled</a> <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30024-1/Truck"">cars</a>. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30284-1/Tractor"">tractor</a> coming later would fit perfectly alongside it also. As it is, it&#39;s a cute enough set for rolling around a little then either stealing the wheels from or leaving as a small desk display piece. Makes a change from racecars anyway, and is fully successful in representing what I&#39;d at least hope it&#39;s trying to be.</p>

<p>In conclusion I&#39;d recommend picking it up if you see it for any less than &pound;3, even if you&#39;re not the biggest fan of car sets.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Solid build with a very well designed model.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fun to play with and good use of parts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price-per-piece ratio is great.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Lot of open space for the driver&rsquo;s compartment, which some may not find enjoyable.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I really dig this vehicle design, it reminds me of a set I used to own from LEGO Town and while the model is not designed for Minifigures it looks and functions well. It could stand to use a better design for the driver&rsquo;s compartment, perhaps not so open, however vehicles of this sort sometimes are designed that way. Do I recommend this set? Most definitely. As a Creator fan this is one of the better Polybags designed and executed and has few weaknesses to speak of.</p>
