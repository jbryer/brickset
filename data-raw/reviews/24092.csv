<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a poly-bag. &nbsp;The instruction is a standard piece of paper. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A good amount of orange parts. &nbsp;(I think the reason I even got the set.) &nbsp;And four of the newer ball joint parts. &nbsp;At the neck and base of the tail. &nbsp;Plus, their is an extra &quot;eye&quot; piece,&nbsp;a long with the standard spare parts. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mini-figures</h3>

<p>Their is none. &nbsp;(But, the set is big enough to have a mini-figure ride him/her. &nbsp;I am thinking you would want to make some adjustment have them ride the tiger properly.)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not to complex for the more experience&nbsp;builder. &nbsp;But, their is some repetition&nbsp;with&nbsp;the the &quot;legs&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is a freaking tiger. &nbsp;(I do not know what else to say.) &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The tiger is blocky. &nbsp;But, that just adds to the charm of the set. &nbsp;And the teeth on the tiger does make it look more like it is a &quot;saber-tooth tiger&quot; than a&nbsp;regular&nbsp;one. &nbsp;Plus, if you want to, you could swap out the orange parts for black and white ones to get a &quot;white tiger&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-01T23:12:16.09Z","Mildly Disappointing Design, Fun Model.","<p><strong>Set #30285 Tiger: </strong>LEGO Creator Polybags fall into two distinct avenues, micro-scaled vehicles and animals. They are a staple of LEGO just as much as LEGO City is, and while the licensed themes and others like Ninjago or Nexo Knights can come and go in a never ending cycle of promotion after promotion you&rsquo;ll always find something interesting with LEGO Creator. Now to discuss the pros and cons of this particular release before going over the final thoughts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Tiger model shares similarities with Cute Kitten also from LEGO Creator, legs and tail, even torso have similar build techniques, though not identical, which is a plus in this sets favor.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fair number of orange and black pieces found in this set, orange bricks are still not widely common outside of Halloween themed sets, making this a semi-decent parts pack for orange pieces such as cheese slopes, 1x1 bricks and plates.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Passable design for a brick built tiger.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Pin in socket system for leg joints once again limits poseability.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Paw design comes off as sneakers, does this little Tiger shop at the same outlet as mascot Tony the Tiger?</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Not enough teeth for my liking in head model, could stand some improvements. Comes off more as a Sabre-tooth than a regular common variety tiger.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I have never really been a fan of large scale Creator sets, the appeal just didn&rsquo;t grab me as much as other Themes and Designs have. That being said I find that you can never truly go wrong with the Polybags from this Theme. Creator offers up solid models, most of the time, with decent ideas for play and imagination and the Polybags are a fun gift for a job well done. They aren&rsquo;t terribly difficult to build, follow the ideals and beliefs of the Core LEGO Brand and so I always find myself heartily recommending them, in-spite of any prejudices I may have against the Theme in general.</p>

<p>I do really wish they&rsquo;d chosen a different paw design though, now I can&rsquo;t get rid of that picture of a tiger wearing sneakers when I look at this model.</p>

"DTRAIN0127","2017-02-14T22:52:29.84Z","Must Buy Polybag!!","<p>The Creator Tiger set is great for play and dis-play! The Ball joint for the tiger&#39;s head and tail allow great poses. The legs can also move, but only back and forth.</p>

<p>On the more negative end, the top of the tail pieces should be smooth tiles, instead of studded tiles.</p>

<p>But overall (almost) everything in this set is perfect!!!</p>
