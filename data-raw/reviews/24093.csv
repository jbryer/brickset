Let&rsquo;s discuss the pros and cons of this set before moving on to the final thoughts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Cheapest method of obtaining the new Snake Skull Helmet head piece.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Includes new ball and socket joints for MOC fans.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Mech build features fun looking build design with some obvious design cues from other builds, I believe the Mixles might have inspired some of the build. The use of a donut piece for the chest is interesting, and the method for building the weapon arms is a great use of technic parts. Overall fun design.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Minifigure has brilliant leg printing, an impressive double-sided torso and a great facial print with snake tattoos. Sinister red eyes add to the overall creepy look of the minifig. Head piece is an awesome new sculpt and has many potential uses.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>No accessories for the Minifigure unless you&rsquo;re willing to disarm the mech.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Pilot area for the Minifigure is a poor design from a protective standpoint. Easily dispatched when fighting against the Ninja.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall this is a fairly solid polybag from the Ninjago Theme, it&rsquo;s a much better cohesive design than some of the earlier builds, judging from images of them, and includes an awesome looking Minifigure with some great parts for army building/MOC enthusiasts. I definitely recommend this one to all fans of the Theme, good parts, and polybags.</p>

<p>This set comes in a normal polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a couple nice parts in this set. You get a dark tan stone sword, a large dark tan dish, and two 1x2 white teeth. The dark tan pieces are nice to get. The total piece count for the set is 43.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sleven:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>So you get Sleven, an Anacondrai Soldier. He has the normal tan Anacondrai rubber snake skull helmet. He has a singled sided head with an angry facial expression. He has red around his eyes and purple tattoos on either side. He has no printing on the back of his head. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have printing of his abs and pecs with two snake tattoos on either side of his torso. He has a belt with red on the top and bottom with two snakes skulls as the belt buckle. On the back you have printing showing some back muscle and the tails of the snakes from the front. The belt is also on the back. He has printing on his legs as well. He has some rope with two spikes (look like teeth on it) as a weapon on him. He has something that looks like chains around his knees and some sort of bone/crown looking thing on his feet. He has no weapon or accessory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice polybag. The mech is really nice and captures that Anacondrai look. The arms are nice (for a polybag) and have good mobility with 180 degree movement in all directions. On the left arm you have a shield and on the right arm the sword. The legs are identical with the white teeth as armor. The legs also have nice mobility as well. Sleven is a nice figure to get with very good printing on it. I recommend this set to any Ninjago fan or collector. If you aren&#39;t this isn&#39;t a must-have and you can pass on getting if you aren&#39;t interested. If you do get it, it will still make a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
