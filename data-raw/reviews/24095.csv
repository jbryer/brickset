<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes packed in polybag&nbsp;with one A4 instruction sheet which remnids me of the older models. Aside from this nothing special about the packaging.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This small model is built using only a few parts, most of them are in dark blue, white and yellow. Some notable parts are dark blue cheese slopes, translucent yellow flat one stud lights and the yellow inflatable landing apparatus is built using some nice cylindrical bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this set is included only one minifig, police pilot sporting dark blue uniform with badge, white helmet with visor and smiling head with orange soprty shades.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Tha build is quick but enjoyable, nothig special.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is nice (for a polybag) but ends up looking like a cube too much.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For a polybag&nbsp;set this one is quite good, some good parts, useful minifig&nbsp;make it a pretty good set for a low price.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just a polybag&nbsp;with a single folded sheet, nothing fancy</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For a small kit there are some nice parts here - the helicopter main rotor and tail rotors can be used on a bigger build and the yellow domes used for the floats are good to have.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Standard navy blue&nbsp;uniformed police guy with a white helmet and nice smiling face with sunglasses print. Good to add to your police force</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quick &amp; simple, mostly studs up with a little clever use of the wheel bases to plug the floats to.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Really a nice model for the size, I guess its going to be&nbsp;windy for the pilot without any cockpit but he doesn&#39;t seem to mind.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Hard to go wrong with this considering it can be bought for under &pound;3 on ebay. We bought it as an addition to the 2015 Swamp Police station and it&#39;s perfect for landing on the rooftop.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:38:57.307Z","Search the Swamp for Crooks.","<p><strong>Set #30311 Swamp Police Helicopter: </strong>LEGO City Polybags often repeat themselves quite a lot. You find yourself with a lot of small fire cars, police helicopters and other all-purpose vehicles for your LEGO City Collection when you&rsquo;re a polybag fan. Let&rsquo;s go over the pros and cons of this set and then discuss recommendations.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Helicopter model is amazingly fun. It features two large pontoons and an open air cockpit. Makes a nice change of pace from past helicopters in these sets, however the pilot won&rsquo;t be able to go very high. Since there&rsquo;s nothing to protect him from the effects of higher altitudes. This is definitely a short hopper for dealing with crooks in the swamp.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>LEGO Police Officer is standard fair. Has dark blue pants (no printing) a double-sided torso common to most officers and a single-sided face. Wears a white helmet with clear visor and a pair of orange sunglasses on his face. Decent enough army builder for LEGO City. (If you aren&rsquo;t tired of police officer armies.)</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Doesn&rsquo;t really do much to challenge the typical LEGO City polybag designs. Features fairly common parts in common colours and only has two rotors, so SNOT fans might be annoyed that the propeller has two visible sections of studs.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for polybags, unfortunately LEGO City polybags tend to be pretty similar from year to year. You have your fire set, your construction or maintenance set, your sub-theme of the year set (such as the Arctic Scout) and your police set. And more often than not the police set is one of either a small car or a helicopter/airplane of some sort. If you&rsquo;re obsessed with polybags this is definitely something you&rsquo;re going to ignore and just buy it regardless.</p>

<p>If you prefer to avoid collecting hundreds of police officers year after year you might prefer skipping this one. Mildly recommended, it does a good job of fitting the sub-theme of the swamp police from this year&rsquo;s LEGO City sets and I do like the overall design of the vehicle. I just wish we could get something more unique from the LEGO City Polybags, why not make a Canadian Themed RCMP Polybag with a horse and a mounted officer?</p>

<p>This set comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any cool or unique parts in this set. The dark blue pieces are really nice to get. Overall pretty simple piece haul. The total piece count of the set is 51.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Police Officer:</strong></p>

<p>The Police Officer comes with a white helmet and dark grey trans visor. He has a single sided head with orange glass and a smile on his face. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front is printing of a police officer jacket with two zippers, a badge, and a blank grey rectangle. On the back is some black lines outlining the jacket. He has plain dark blue legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a decent Lego City polybag. The helicopter itself is nice. The pontoons on each side add to the look and uniqueness&nbsp;of the helicopter. The cockpit is nice and the Police Officer fits nicely in it. The Police Officer is pretty simple but looks good and works nicely for this set. I do recommend this to a Lego City collector or if you like helicopters. If you aren&#39;t into Lego city or helicopters this set probably isn&#39;t for you. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
