"samuraiturtle","2015-08-06T02:43:34.347Z","Rev Up That Motor","<p>Box/Instructions - It is the standard poly-bag and instruction sheet. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - The two best parts are for the engine of the go-cart. &nbsp;Witch are a &quot;ray gun&quot; &amp; &quot;ultra&nbsp;agents&nbsp;fist&nbsp;part&quot;. &nbsp;I guess a third best part would be the &quot;round brick with the groves&quot; (I do not have to many of those). &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Mini-figure&nbsp;- He is a &quot;Octan&quot; driver with a red helmet in a jump suit. &nbsp;Nothing to special about him other wise. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The build - Fairly&nbsp;standard for a set this size. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model - Is basically&nbsp;what you see, a go-cart with &quot;light stand&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion - A good little set, if you want a race cart. &nbsp;And a cheep way to get one of the &quot;ultra agents fist&quot; (if you would want one). &nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:45:19.27Z","Go Octan Racer, Go!","<p><strong>Set #30314 Go-Kart Racer:</strong> Another year has gone by and another helping of LEGO City Polybags has been released. Now in 2016 we shall discuss the pros and cons of each set and whether or not they should be picked up. First up this little gem of an idea from LEGO City Racers.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Go-Kart model is quite fun and accurate to the advertised vehicle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use of accessory parts such as the large fist piece and the sci-fi ray gun to make the engine block is inspired design choice.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Minifigure represents our favorite racing team from Octan, complete with Octan logo on jacket print and OCTAN company name on back print. Colouring of red green and white also matches quite nicely.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Extra stop and go lights for lap notification is a fun little build.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Driver is generic, and Polybag could have used an extra Minifigure for additional options, would have been nice to see a female mechanic/driver to accompany to male character in this set, similar to how the LEGO Polybag Jetski from a few years ago had a male and female character included.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>The more LEGO City looks outside of the standard police and fire based sub-themes for their Polybags the greater the chances to find and own some wonderful builds that can truly expand and populate a LEGO City. Strongly recommend tracking this down if you don&rsquo;t already own, and if you enjoy it, get more than one for added play value.</p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few cool parts in this set. The large iron fist and silver space gun used to create the engine are very cool parts to get. Other than the rest of parts are fairly common.&nbsp;The total piece count for the set is 45.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Go-Kart Driver:</strong></p>

<p>The Go-Kart Driver comes with a red helmet and a trans clear visor. He has a single sided head with a grin on it. The torso is really good with his Octan racing uniform. The printing is really good and has the small Octan logo on it. He has green legs. Overall a decent figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty good city polybag. The go-kart looks really good. The design of the engine is really good and the pieces used was a great use of them. You also get a signal stand which is cool. The figure is pretty good and the printing on his torso looks great. I recommend this set to any Lego city collector. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
