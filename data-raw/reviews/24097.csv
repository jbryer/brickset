Be that as it may here&rsquo;s the pros and cons of this little set and whether or not you should track it down.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model of Fountain is extremely cute and impressive. Includes white pieces, some teal and heart shaped jewel in the centre of the hear design brick-built section.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Stephanie mini-doll is cute, includes a camera, a pair of orange skates (with a third extra) and fun hair piece with ponytail and sun visor.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Includes gold coins and silver five cent printed studs for making wishes.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Spare skate leaves you with an uneven number.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Could use more clear blue pieces for simulated water effects.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I strongly recommend this set, it is a brilliant little set piece for the LEGO Friends Heartlake City, and includes a lot of charm and adorableness. Honestly the biggest complaint is the fountain seems slightly too small, if it were larger it would be even better, as is though it&rsquo;s very well thought out and an excellent addition to the LEGO Friends Polybag line.</p>
