The only interesting minifigure here is Snake, as he is exclusive to the set. Apu has an exclusive printing on his torso but was previously seen in The Simpsons Series 1 CMFs. Chief Wiggum also have an exclusive print on his torso, but it is very similar to the torso from Series 1 Simpsons.&nbsp;Homer, Marge and Bart all have the same parts from the Simpsons Series 1 CMFs, which is a little disappointing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Wiggum&#39;s police car is impressive. There are several stickers used to add extra detail, including one for the number plate, which reads &#39;#1 DOOFUS&#39;. You can fit 3 minifigures inside, 2 in the front and 1 in the back. There is also a boot at the back, which opens, to store handcuffs and batons.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the Kwik-E-Mart. The front looks very nice, with a large sign, which reads &#39;Kwik-E-Mart&#39;. The &#39;E&#39; in the sign is brick-built whereas the &#39;Kwik&#39; and &#39;Mart&#39; are stickers. The front also has two telephone booths, which, in my opinion, is very impressive. On the right side, there is a small area to hold a large bin, which holds 2 bags (which are Santa sacks in black).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back opens to reveal the interior. The interior is absolutely fantastic, it has so many details. There is an &#39;EZ Money&#39;&nbsp;ATM, coffee machine, an area where you can get donuts and hot dogs,&nbsp;a &#39;Buzz Cola&#39; drinks machine, 2 arcade games (one is called &#39;Bonestorm&#39; and the other is called &#39;Great White Hunter&#39;), a &#39;Squishee&#39;&nbsp;machine, several refrigerators, cash register, two aisles of food, nappies (or diapers for people who live across the pond) and perfume, an area which holds magazines, leaflets and newspapers &amp; a stack of &#39;Powersauce&#39;. The roof&nbsp;has a vegetable garden, with many vegetables, and 3 skylights (which let no light in at all).</p>

<p>I think this set is excellent. There are so many details, particularly in the interior. Wiggum&#39;s police car is nice, and there are some nice printed parts. However, there are a lot of stickers, I mean a lot! Also, in the UK, this set retails for &pound;169.99, which is expensive for what it is. However, it is a great set and I definitely recommend it!</p>

<p>I am a fan, so is my son, so when Santa left this for him under the tree we both let out a cry of joy. Now between us we have built the model sharing the experience and it is a wonderful model. Full of humor, clever features and playability. Just like the firehouse, it provides much more than an iconic building model to sit gathering dust.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want a bit of colour in your collection, then dont&nbsp;hesitate to buy this model</p>

"blasto2236","2022-02-20T06:31:17.123Z","Still awesome 7 years later","<p>I wish I had bought this set back when it first released, but I was sadly in my dark age during that time. I was aware of the release of the Simpsons house set back in 2014, but I didn&#39;t pull the trigger then and get back into the hobby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flash forward to nearly a decade later, a friend got me the Seinfeld set for Christmas, and I went nuts getting back into the hobby. Curious about the Simpsons house I was interested in all those years ago, I found there was also a Kwik-E-Mart set released a year later!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I ended up paying a bit over 2x what this set used to retail for before it was retired, and I&#39;m here to tell you it&#39;s 100% worth that price and even more. This was one of my white whales along with the Simpsons house, and it did not disappoint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build did a great job of alternating between the interior and exterior of the building, so it never got too repetitive. The interior is absolutely&nbsp;packed with detail and references to the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As someone who missed all the CMF Simpsons figs, I have zero complaints about the minifig selection. Sure, there are some repeats from the house, but they make sense here. And I appreciate the better designs included here over what was included in the Simpsons house set. The eyelids made them all look sleepy in that set, and these are just much better representations of all the characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly, having just built Simpsons house and this set in the last few weeks, it&#39;s hard to believe these were released within a year of each other, and by the same designer at Lego. The interior designs here are so much more advanced than the Simpsons house set. Marcos should be proud of his design evolution here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, both of these sets are well worth the money for anyone thinking of snagging them in 2022 and beyond. If given the choice between one or the other I&#39;d absolutely get this one first. Honestly, I thought my opinion would be the opposite until I obtained and built both sets.</p>

<p>It seems this license is done, but now that Disney owns it, I have hopes we may see another partnership down the line. The comic book shop or the elementary school would both be iconic locations that would sit nicely beside both of these sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
