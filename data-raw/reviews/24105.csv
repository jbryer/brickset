"BrickBomb","2015-03-21T23:01:50.31Z","Better and Bigger Than I Thought","<p>I bought this set at 12.99$ and love it. When images first came out of this set i was a little hesitant to add&nbsp;this to my buy list. Due to it&#39;s all exclusive&nbsp;minifigures and low price&nbsp;I decided to get&nbsp;this. After opening up the box and assembling Tony Stark I decided to try out the new super jump, my first one. This is where&nbsp;I ran into my first and only major problem.</p>

<p>I HATE the super jumpers. They jump just fine but getting your minifigure&nbsp;off the jumper is my problem. I had to&nbsp;struggle to get Iron Man of the darn thing with out breaking the legs(I failed too). When stress marks appeared on the figure&nbsp;I took a&nbsp;tool to use as a mini crowbar. Even though the feet are now gnarled up, it&#39;s a whole lot better then&nbsp;broken plastic. I recommend leaving Iron Man&#39;s feet&nbsp;repulser cylinders on. Now on to the set.</p>

<p>The Minifigures</p>

<p>First off is Iron Man Mark 45. This&nbsp;Iron Man&nbsp;variant is exclusive to the set. It is not&nbsp;the same figure&nbsp;as the one in the other Age of Ultron sets.&nbsp;This version is better,&nbsp;in my opinion, than the Iron Man Mark 43. Tony does not come with a hair piece but a double sided face. One face shows Tony Stark smirking and the other one angry.</p>

<p>Next is the Ultron Sentry. This figure is in the set twice and is amazing.&nbsp;Except for his hands and waist, he is all dark&nbsp;metallic. The detail on him is tremendous with blue energy. His face has blue&nbsp;eyes and a&nbsp;gaping mouth similar to Ultron Prime and the classic Ultron. His repulser studs are a dark transparent&nbsp;blue with studs for foot repulsers instead of the usual cylinder piece. He also comes with a light grey stud shooter.</p>

<p>Last but not least is the Ultron Sentry Officer. This minifigure is identical to the other sentries other than his helmet and backpack. His helmet is a dark metallic coloring of the one used on Ultimate Ultron in 76032. His backpack is two antennas attached to the new 2 by 1 back piece(18986).</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>The main build is a small ship/air craft.&nbsp;It has a&nbsp;main section with&nbsp;a long tail in the back and&nbsp;two wings on the side. The two sentries are supposed to be reassembled on the craft. the head and body attach to the wings while the legs attach in the back on the sides of&nbsp;the tail. While some people may not like this&nbsp;I actually think this is a great function. The legs give the look of thrusters in the back while the bodies look like turrets or guns. The officer&#39;s legs attach to the bottom of the front look like more thrusters or more guns. The officers body controls the craft on the top. He is completely loose and is held down by a droid arm and clip piece. The arm can be moved&nbsp;down so that the officer can be shot out with the super jumper.</p>

<p>All in all I really like this set. It is extremely fun&nbsp;and at a low price. I would recommend this to anyone.&nbsp;</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2015-08-07T04:49:33.767Z","Ultron vs. Iron Man!","<p>As the smallest set in the new Avengers line, this set brings a nice pack of minifigures&nbsp;to the lineup, but lacks in several areas.&nbsp;I bought this small set before I had the chance to see the film, so lets see how it stacks up now that I have had the chance to see the movie twice.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>So the parts &nbsp;in this set are basic gray pieces that would be familiar to any Lego Sci-Fi fan. The new blasters are a goofy yet fun play feature. The super&nbsp;jumper is kind-off pointless, I haven&#39;t had any leg damaging problems with it yet like other Lego fans have reported, but frankly I cannot even fit a minifigure onto it! The mold doesn&#39;t allow the figure to get on without jamming it on (fair warning that it will be hard to get off the jumper), unless pieces such as Iron Man&#39;s repulsors are placed first on the super jumper. The backpack used on the sentry fig has a nice transparent piece which could be used for some MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This Iron Man figure is gorgeous. The movie provides no clear explanation as to why Stark built this armor to fight Ultron, although the smooth lines sometimes makes me wonder is Stark was copying Ultron&#39;s&nbsp;smooth armor in a sense... The Lego fig uses two tones of red to really make the fig&#39;s colors pop. The three Ultron figs are nice, although I prefer the so called &quot;sentry&quot; without the super large backpack antenna things...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The speeder thing is a simple Lego build, no surprises, no complications... not much more to say.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The way the Ultron figs are disassembled to ride the speeder is ridiculous. It honestly looks better without the random minifig parts everywhere. I think I might just turn it into a Star Wars speeder, or something like that...</p>

<p>But once the speeder is built, it is very playable. Swooshes well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set for the figs and the speeder has potential with a bit of work. Although the speeder does not exist in the film, it has&nbsp;enough &quot;plausibility&quot; to look the part: unlike the drunken&nbsp;Mandarin&#39;s&nbsp;flame throwing golf cart in the last cheep set Iron Man appeared in... And with some work, those pieces could become (spoiler alert) a center console for a support system capable of turning a city into a meteor, if that makes sense :)&nbsp;... Use this set for what you&nbsp;want, be it parts, figs, or a swooshable&nbsp;ship that defies all sense of canon. Take it for what it is, that is all I can say.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2015-10-27T14:14:10.747Z","Troop Build Ultron","<p><strong>Set #76029 Iron Man vs. Ultron: </strong>Age of Ultron has been great for LEGO Marvel sets this year, we&rsquo;ve seen the Hulkbuster, another Quinjet and Avengers Tower, and with this set you can have some awesome army building fun. Unfortunately it isn&rsquo;t much else than a troop builder for your Ultron army, why? We&rsquo;ll get into that with the review.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Iron Man Mk 45: Unique to this set Iron Man has the details we&rsquo;ve seen many times before, with double-sided torso and leg printing and the great armour piece. It&rsquo;s another awesome addition to LEGO Iron Man&rsquo;s Armory.</p>

<p>He comes with the new Super Jumper piece, something I haven&rsquo;t discussed before, it&rsquo;s a nice play feature, but a bit pointless for older collectors. And it&rsquo;s hit or miss here, as you&rsquo;d need to aim it very carefully to strike the top of the Sentry Officer to knock it off the ship.</p>

<p>Ultron Sentry: Highly detailed print on this Minifigure with double-sided torso and leg printing as well as printing on the back of the head. The sentries all share this same print and I really enjoy the look of it, the attention to detail for the mechanical look of the Ultron character make these stand out quite nicely. Each regular sentry includes a stud launcher accessory.</p>

<p>Ultron Sentry Officer: The only difference between this figure and the regular sentries is the inclusion of a helmet piece and an interesting new 2x2 transparent backpack piece with two controlling antenna on it.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The build in this set was never in the movie, not once. As far as I can tell this is a situation similar to the Star Wars Battle Packs due to licensing rights with Hasbro and their action figure department. Either way it&rsquo;s a fairly weak build, it&rsquo;s a funky looking flying vehicle similar to the ships used by the Chitauri in Avengers. This one cleverly incorporates the Minifigures themselves into the design as the engines for this vehicle to get it off the ground.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Fairly weak. The uniform colour scheme is the biggest saving grace. It is fun to play with, but without the Minifigures attached to it, it doesn&rsquo;t fly and it doesn&rsquo;t really serve much of a purpose. Honestly LEGO might have done better to make some sort of weapons platform or something else besides this odd flying chariot thing.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Recommended mostly for the Minifigures who are all unique to this set. If the model had been more thought out it would definitely be much higher on my list of must own sets. If you want the Mark 45 armour though this is the only means to get it. If it&rsquo;s on sale though at a good discount I&rsquo;d recommend picking up multiples to have multiple Ultron Sentries for your Avengers Minifigures to do battle with.</p>

"Echolord","2016-05-03T01:27:09.333Z","For something that was not in the movie, this is great!","<p>I was apprehensive about this set at first, but it was the cheapest way to get the Iron Man mk 45 suit, so I got it. To say the least, I was not disappointed. This set, though small, and definitely not in Age of Ultron, is amazing. It has four great minifigures, and uses some really cool concepts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the standard battle pack size, with the tab to open it on the back. I really like the box art for some reason, and I can&#39;t place why, I just do. The instructions are short, and really simple.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have any special pieces, but I do want to briefly touch on the superjumpers. And this section is entirely my opinion, so please, do not feel obligated to feel the same way about these that I do. I think the Superjumpers, though very nice in concept, are very poorly executed. They don&#39;t function very well, and tend to break minifigure legs. When they do actually jump, they are completely impossible to aim, and they just make me frustrated.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set is entirely a minifigure set, and there is nothing wrong with that. The Mk 45 Iron Man suit is extremely well detailed, with some new, red highlights on the dark red torso and legs. I do like the increased use of dark stone grey printing on this suit, especially on the mask, where it forms the sides of the face. The detailing on this suit is probably the best out of any Iron Man Suit yet. The Ultron soldiers and officer are really cool minifigures. They are perfect for building an Ultron army! I love the detailing on the torso and head! The legs are the same as Ultron Prime.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a relatively short, and easy build. I spent maybe ten minutes building this, and though small, enjoyed every minute of it! The build actually incorporates the minifigures, which is a new thing that I don&#39;t think has been done before.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed Ultron hovercraft is really cool looking, especially once you attach the drones. The legs are removed, and actually built into the craft, as are the torsos and heads. The effect this gives is really neat, as it appears that the Ultron Drones are actually part of the craft.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is awesome, and I recommend it to anyone looking to build an army of Ultron drones.&nbsp;</p>

"Bobbits","2017-12-22T02:57:58.47Z","Iron Man vs. Ultron Review!","<p>Hey everyone! Welcome to my first review! So I&#39;m going to be reviewing&nbsp;the Iron Man vs. Ultron&nbsp;LEGO Marvel set.</p>

<p><img src=""https://images.brickset.com/sets/small/76029-1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>So starting off, the Ultron&nbsp;aircraft is a nice little build. Not the greatest, but it works. It has a sleek design and the color scheme is good. It definitely captures the Ultron&nbsp;type of feel. The wings are my only complaint though. They could&#39;ve been a bit smoother, to go along with the sleek design. But overall, a pretty good build.</p>

<p>Next are the minifigures. The Iron Man is pretty basic, though the mask looks good, with the bit of silver on the sides. The Ultron and Ultron&nbsp;bots are cool too. They have the right look, and I like the gray and blue colors. So the minifigures are nice, and you get four of them.</p>

<p>So overall, this set is not bad for 13 bucks, since you get four minifigures. It&#39;s definitely worth it if you want more Ultron&nbsp;bots. So, good set.</p>
