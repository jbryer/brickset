"cyruste","2015-10-18T16:56:44.257Z","Nice small set!","<p>This is my first review ever on a set, and since i did not see any posted for this, I&nbsp;figured I&#39;d give it a shot! Being my 2nd Marvel&#39;s superhero set for the 2015 avenger&#39;s wave, i have to say i really love this set, vehicles, and of course the minifigs! However, i do try to be objective and be able to give an objective review if others are uncertain if to get this set or not.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Decent box-art, and it is reflective of what the set is. Having also watched the movie, it does match with the scene where the Avengers attempt to recover the scepter&nbsp;to take the Hydra base (in the beginning). However, for movie accuracy, the jeep did have Black Widow helming the steering wheel, while Hawk-eye took out some hydra agents @ the back and Thor flying over. Having said that, i would&#39;ve thought including the black widow in this set would&#39;ve been awesome, but it&#39;ll bump the price up for this set (as well as reduce the exclusivity of Black Widow). I don&#39;t recall seeing a similar buggy the Hydra agent is in, but it goes give a fresh feel, rather than having 2 similar vehicles</p>

<p>Instructions are direct and straightforward and as with sets of this size, come in 1 booklet. complimentary &quot;comic&quot; is included as well.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>nothing really special that calls out to me on this, but if there were some, it would be the clear blue 2x1 studded and smooth tiles use on the hydra buggy. Also, 8 tires! :)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As with most Super Heroes sets, i feel the real draw are the minifigures. This set is no exception. i wanted to collect all the avengers members, and happened to choose this as it was affordable to me that had Hawk-eye (I believe that at the time of writing, 76042 helicarrier set priced @ US$350 was the only other one that had it in this wave). Thor is also a nice add-on, but is also available (and of similar design) in the 76038 avengers&nbsp;tower set. The Hydra agent also does look awesome and as with the minifigs, have double printed heads (Hydra agents is not 2-sided face, but printed, Hawk-eye and Thor are). Only Hawk-eye have printed legs, and Thor&#39;s cape is soft.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the Hydra&nbsp;buggy was a fun build and i was pretty impressed with the way they used the &quot;slanted&quot; stretcher piece as the frame of the buggy. i was however not too impressed with the way they had the canon/pea-shooter mounted onto the buggy, but only realized later for playability purposes why it was made to be so loose. (they had intended to have Thor &quot;jump&quot; using the clear jumper and hit the antenna to disarm the buggy). The black Jeep was like any other vehicle build to me, yet i much enthusiasm building in anticipation of what the completed model would be like.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Given the size of this set, i would say it&#39;s great! Cons i would say are the &quot;covers&quot; for the wheels on the avengers jeep did look like it was missing a slant on the&nbsp;side closer to the ends of the vehicles (both front and back). Just 3 stickers for this set, but i would say they are a good compromise in terms of production cost (of course i prefer printed tiles! :) )</p>

<p>There is also a play feature for this, as mentioned in the build, but another flaw i find is that it can&#39;t fit Thor onto the jumper piece. Since i&#39;m not really into the play feature, i&#39;m not placing a heavy negative emphasis on that, but believe TLG should focus on getting that right if they want to make it a mainstay.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>it&#39;s a great set. I absolutely love it. Got it for the minifigures and they do not disappoint. Worthy of 5/5? maybe not, but it&#39;s good to pick up if you want all the avengers (and not willing to get 76042) and obviously if you are a completionist. I personally was impressed with the Hydra buggy but that was a bonus to me.</p>

"Echolord","2016-05-03T01:51:59.8Z","Great way to expand your Avengers Collection!","<p>I got this set specifically for Thor and Hawkeye, but I soon discovered that the rest of the set was just as awesome as the minifigures! The two small builds combined make a great play set!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is your average box for a set this size, with yet another great graphic on the front and back. The instructions are a bit of a nuisance this time, as the difference between black and dark stone grey are not very well given. This can sometimes be annoying as you are looking for pieces. Otherwise, the instructions are great!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t contain any spectacular pieces, but it does contain two which I had not had before. The bow for Hawkeye is really cool, and I appreciate the design of the Lego compound bow, it really works at LEGO scale. Mjolnir (Thor&#39;s hammer) is also a really cool piece, and it captures the hammer perfectly in LEGO Scale. I definitely hope it continues to be used, but maybe some printing on the hammer head would be nice too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I got this for the minifigures, I admit. And they do not disappoint. Thor is an amazing minifig, though he could use some leg printing really bad. Every other avenger except Cap has leg printing, and I think Thor could really use it here. The torso printing is really good, and it looks just like his armor from Thor: Dark World. A little more gold would have made it more accurate to Age of Ultron. Either way, the printing is still very good. The new spongy cape had me a little worried when I first got this set, but I really warmed up to it within a few minutes. It allows for some poseability, without damaging the cape&nbsp;itself. I believe the head is the same as from the first Avenger movie, and is still great, with amazing printing that looks just like the character. The hair has me a little off. I know LEGO can produce the proper hair color, it exists on Fili the Dwarf in the Hobbit theme. Why isn&#39;t it used here? It would look a lot better than the pale yellow hair he has here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hawkeye is also amazing. I love the coat he has printed onto his torso, it&#39;s super accurate. The details captured on both sides of the torso and legs truly make this a great minifigure. I just hope LEGO can replicate this level of detail on Hawkeye when they make a Civil War version of the character. The face is exclusive to the Age of Ultron minifig, I believe, and it is also incredibly detailed. The face without goggles looks amazing accurate, and detailed, and the goggles are also really well done, with glare printed onto them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hydra soldier is nothing spectacular, and you get him in one other set. The new printing is really cool, with some great gold and purple bits. This detail level is something LEGO has been getting much better at over the past few years. The face is also really detailed, with a mask, and a frowning mouth. The backs shows either and entire mask, or the back of a helmet, I can&#39;t decide. Either way, the printing is amazing, and looks really cool.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about 20 minutes, and was really fun. I never thought I would be building LEGO cars again, once I discovered STAR WARS, but here I was, building two of them. The Avengers Jeep is a really cool design, using some techniques I don&#39;t remember from the LEGO City theme in 2007. There are only two stickers in the entire set, and they both look amazing on the build. My favorite part of the build is the little light rack on the top of the Jeep, which looks really cool and is a really creative way of using the fence piece. The&nbsp;Hydra Buggy was a little more simple, but just as fun to build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed models look great, and are amazing for playability. You can fit both Avengers in the Jeep, with places for their weapons, which I think is an added bonus.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is amazing. I have no regrets about buying this. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap way to get a great vehicle, and Thor and Hawkeye.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T15:31:25.933Z","Fairly Decent Set for the Price","<p><strong>Set # 76030 Avengers Hydra Showdown: </strong>Age of Ultron features the most sets from 2015 and as usual you&rsquo;ll have some good sets and some duds in the entire year&rsquo;s worth of sets. Is this one of the duds? Find out during the course of this review.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: A small box that, as always, captures the eye by showing off the contents of the set with an exciting action shot on the front and a play feature showcase on the back, every box from this year also pronounces the newest play feature addition the Super Jumper! Not much else to discuss really, it does its job and by now Marvel Super Heroes box designers have fallen into a predictable pattern.</p>

<p>Instructions: For a set this size it&rsquo;s nice to see a single booklet for the instructions. More often than not of late LEGO has been breaking up the builds in numbered bags and across two separate manuals whenever there are two different vehicles in a Super Hero set. This one does break up the builds by numbered bags, however you&rsquo;ll find the instructions all in one manual, with easy to follow steps, typical cross-promotions at the end of the book and the included comic as a separate addition.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also find a sticker sheet for some minor details. Overall your standard LEGO Super Hero build instructions and included silent comic adventure showcasing all of the available sets from the wave, except of course the store exclusive.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Nothing truly stands out in the parts department this go round, it&rsquo;s all fairly standard, although you might be interested in the two vehicle chassis pieces that are included for building up both vehicles. They&rsquo;re fairly common, but always interesting to see used in new and unconventional ways for MOC fans.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Hawkeye: The new AoU version of Hawkeye has a dark red and black costume, which is printed on his legs and double-sided torso. He&rsquo;s using the same hair piece as far as I can see from the original and the same basic costume design, only tweaked from his initial version. He&rsquo;s got the same bow accessory and a walkie talkie for communication, his face is a double-sided print with one side wearing goggles and angry and the other side not wearing goggles and looking unamused about some joke Tony might have just blurted out.</p>

<p>Hydra Henchman: He has no accessories and no leg printing, but he looks like a great troop buildable Minifigure, his double-sided torso print shows off a grey body armour with some sort of gold and purple metallic harness which has the Hydra symbol on his back. He&rsquo;s using the Bruce Wayne hair piece in dark brown and has a double-sided head with only one facial expression, he&rsquo;s wearing some kind of advanced wrap around technical device that seems to enhance his vision based on how the screen covers his eyes. A pretty nifty looking design.</p>

<p>Thor: I believe the torso print has been slightly modified from his original Avengers design, but overall Thor is pretty much very similar to what we&rsquo;ve seen before. He&rsquo;s got his hammer and is now wearing a new softer material cape that holds its shape much better, everything else is pretty much what we&rsquo;ve seen before, if slightly modified as the costume is concerned so there&rsquo;s not much else to say.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: With both bags you are building typical LEGO Super Hero vehicles, for Bag #1 you are making a small Hydra dune buggy, or something that looks suspiciously like a dune buggy, and it&rsquo;s a relatively quick build. Due to the nature of the New Super Jumper style of play patterns there is a bit of the build that isn&rsquo;t 100% secured as well as if it had actually been built normally, however nothing here should pose a problem for younger builders.</p>

<p>Bag 2: In this bag you&rsquo;re building what I assume is meant to be a vehicle formerly used by SHIELD, but now employed by the Avengers. It even has a sticker applied during the build with the Avengers logo. Again nothing in this build is too difficult, and honestly having built so many four wheeled vehicles in this line already nothing truly stands out during the build. It&rsquo;s quick, it&rsquo;s easy and it&rsquo;s a little boring if I&rsquo;m completely honest with myself. How many four wheeled trucks, vans and assorted other types of vehicles does one team of super heroes really need?</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Hydra Dune Buggy: This is a seriously fun little model. It&rsquo;s loads of fun to just roll around and if you found someone piecing this set out by numbered bags you could have a small army of these things for your collection. Even the Super Jumper play feature isn&rsquo;t as intrusive as in some of the other models of the Theme from this year, basically the small stud shooter on top is being held loosely in place by a droid arm with a light on one end. Take your Super Jumper with Super Hero attached and aim for the aerial sticking out, now you have to manually move the droid arm out of the way to get this to work, but hit it just right and the stud launcher will be sent flying. (It rests in a pin joint piece with a Technic axle. Because of this it moves a bit too freely, but it will stay put with the droid arm/light piece keeping it in place.)</p>

<p>Great little vehicle, perfect for army building some Hydra figures.</p>

<p>Avengers Assault Jeep: This vehicle isn&rsquo;t too bad, it does look nice, although I will admit to not liking the open air design of the front of the vehicle. The entire driver&rsquo;s section has no doors and not even a roof, I suppose it&rsquo;s for easy access for the Minifigures, and so the characters can just hop out quick and engage in battle with the enemy, however the model suffers a bit for being too open.</p>

<p>On top you&rsquo;ll find a spinning cannon with two flick-fire missiles to target the Hydra Buggy. One character can stand on the back of this, you could fit two characters in the front driving section with a bit of fiddling, but it is a tight fit and I&rsquo;m not particularly fond of how it looks. The colours are nice though, the all black look is a much nicer colour pattern compared to the SHIELD blue of most SHIELD vehicles, making it more unique and not part of the same motor pool.</p>

<p>Overall not a bad pair of vehicles, however they do have some minor aesthetic flaws, the dune buggy is way more impressive in my eyes than the Avengers jeep because it is meant to be an open aired vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>For a 25$ set from 2015 this isn&rsquo;t a terrible one, it has a nice pair of vehicles for the most part and a decent selection of Minifigures. I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it, though I would caution you that if you don&rsquo;t care much for all of the vehicles coming out from Marvel Super Heroes you may want to just skip this one, unless you want a Hydra army for your MCU collection, you&rsquo;ll need at least a few of those dune buggies to build up a decent protective force for the Hydra Fortress set.</p>

"Faefrost","2017-01-01T08:19:43.45Z","Some decent figs plus two unremarkable vehicles, you get it for the figs.","<p>This is one of those small sets that is mostly thought of as almost but not quite a battle pack. Typically 4 figs at a $20 price point, with a small build. Unfortunately this one is 3 figs at that price.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions -</strong>&nbsp;A fairly generic box art. It looks similar to the other larger Hydra set and to later sets such as the Crossbones one. Instructions are crumpled up and stuffed in the box like it was a high school juniors bra on junior prom night.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -</strong>&nbsp;Some nicely executed, but not extremely exciting figs;</p>

<p>Thor - He is the newer Age of Ultron Thor, so his hair is a little better and his armor is more detailed. He&#39;s still just Thor. You have 4 or 5 of him (all without winged hats :( )</p>

<p>Hawkeye - He wears a new long coat with red markings. He has his newer style bow. The use of the Sleepyhead hairpiece in Light Medium Flesh for him is just horribly wrong. He has 2 faces. Angry teeth clenching with sunglasses/goggles on. And happy peaceful face with goggles off. The goggles, they do nothing? He has front back torso printing and leg prints.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hydra Dude(?) - Hawkeye intercepted a Hydra dude on his way back from a European Gay Disco. You can tell with all the gold lame this guy is wearing. The gold lensed ski goggles just seal the deal. He is some weird interpretation of a Hydra goon. It is a little hard to tell him apart from the Chitauri&nbsp;or Ultron figures. The only distinguishing feature is he has hair. Now he isn&#39;t even unique to this set. We see him again in Hydra Fortress Smash. Normally I am a sucker for Henchmen. But this guy challenges even me to defend him.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>Dear gods! this set features Leg Breakers! I mean Super Jumpers... just say no. Beyond that danger there is nothing distinct.</p>

<p><strong>Build/Model -&nbsp;</strong>The set builds two nice little ATV&#39;s. A Hydra Dune Buggie, and a SHIELD SUV. They are nicely made and serviceable&nbsp;versions of the type of vehicle you likely have dozens of. The generic Jeeps that every Superheroes&nbsp;set comes with. These are good specimens, but nothing special.</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;It&#39;s a good serviceable set. 2 fun if unexciting cars, 2 major heroes and a Hydra henchmen for &gt;$19. Just immediately feed the Super Jumper to the Dog to prevent anyone from trying to use it. Cause that way lies tears.</p>

"FowlerBricks","2017-10-23T21:17:55.043Z","A Great Set For Anyone!","<p>This is the second smallest set in the Age Of Ultron line. It retailed at $19.99 which is pretty good for what you get.</p>

<p><br />
THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS<br />
The box is a new design made specifically for Age Of Ultron. It sports Marvel&#39;s usual clors and shows all the Avengers in their Age Of Ultron gear. The instructions are much the same. Both are very well done.</p>

<p><br />
THE PARTS<br />
Lots of black and white pieces. You also get eight rubber tires, six big and two smaller plus some trans light-blue parts and a stud-shooter. Oh, and a pearlized silver engine.</p>

<p><br />
THE MINIFIGURES<br />
This set includes Hawkeye &nbsp;aka Clint Barton, Thor and a Hydra Soldier. Hawkeye: all new, all improved!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/p4r9jyf8j/Hawkeye.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>He finally has the correct hair color! The style of hair looks great too. His face now has a new print. Instead of being smirking with glasses and angry without, it is now vice versa. His torso and legs have been redone as well. It&#39;s dark red and black with some dark grey highlights. The back of the torso is printed with some very realistic creases. It all looks amazing. I like this version much better than than the old, very flawed version. This one has a few flaws, when you look at him from a movie-accurate point of view, but he&#39;s waayy better than the previous one. He comes with his compound bow.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/nppovioir/Hawkeye-_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The HYDRA Soldier: in Age Of Ultron, the Avengers launch an attack on a HYDRA base in Sokovia. As they approach, they are met with a semi-formidable defense. Most of the HYDRA soldiers wear normal military gear, but if you look closely, there are some dressed in white, gold and spots of purple that fly around on jetpacks.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/xn0polj9v/Hydra_Hench-_Dude_Main.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>This minifigure is based on them&nbsp;(These dudes: http://marvelcinematicuniverse.wikia.com/wiki/File:Aou_Concept_Art_28.jpg). They&#39;re hard to see, so I&#39;m not sure how accurate this figure is, but he does look pretty cool! The armor is Chituari armor that HYDRA was experimenting with, so it&#39;s gold and purple. Underneath, the soldier has more armor, but gray this and under that, he appears to have a jumpsuit covered in grey and white digital camo. The back of the torso has the armor continued, along with a tiny HYDRA logo. Aw, isn&#39;t it cute?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/fk7mxeq03/Hydra_Hench-_Dude_Head.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The legs are plain white with a light grey waist. His head is printed with really neat electronic visor on the front and on the back...well, I&#39;m not really sure what&#39;s on the back. It&#39;s printing, certainly, but what and why is unkown to me. It seems to be more electronic stuff, but the hair covers it most of the time, so it seems like a bit of a waste. Leg printing might have served better. Unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t include any weapons. Maybe his training is enough to take on the Avengers? Thor: now, at first glance, it may seem like Thor didn&#39;t really get much of an update. Look closer. He did.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5ob5b4c2b/Thor.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Update NO.1: The face. Thor&#39;s face now has a smiling face! I actually really like that. Between the old head and the new one, you have a nice little range of expressions.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/mc2ndljoj/Thor-_Alt_Face.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Update NO.2: The cape. Thor&#39;s cape is now the new, soft version. Update NO.3: The torso. Thor&#39;s torso has been changed to match his new outfit, plus his arms are now pearlized dark silver.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/w9do6p9ar/Thor-_Back_Of_Torso.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;So, there&#39;s a few fairly major changes from the last one. His legs remain unchanged, as do his hair, which I&#39;m not very happy about. A darker shade would have suited better. Thor&#39;s accesory is his ever-present hammer. There are a few cons about this minifigure. The hair is the biggest one for me. It just doesn&#39;t match his beard. The other con probably only applies to my figure in particular: he has a misprint on the smiling side of his face, just a small little one on his mouth. Overall, Thor has improved, but not quite to perfection.</p>

<p><br />
THE BUILDS<br />
We&#39;ll start with the slightly smaller of the builds: the HYDRA dune buggy or should I say snow buggy?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4kmflkmnn/Buggy.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The build of the car is brilliant, using a fairly small amount of parts to create an accurate to real life vehicle (well, minus the laser cannon on top). The HYDRA soldier fits nicely inside, with a comfy looking tan seat with a headrest for him to lean back on.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/vigcnazkz/Buggy-_Side.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The rollcage/windshield thing can be lifted up so that you can insert the soldier into his seat with ease. There is one sticker on this vehicle, on the front, that displays the HYDRA logo.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/hc0lryeeb/Buggy-_Front_Open.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>One of the things I like most about this buggy is the lights that stick up off the front. They make the whole thing more realistic.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/cdd3dl2xf/Buggy-_Front.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The gun on the top is a stud-shooter and if you move the light on the side, you can knock it off with a well-aimed spring missile or super-jumper (yes, super-jumpers can really work if you do it correctly). If you want to, you can just remove the gun and have a (semi) regular dune/snow buggy. Remember how I said that there is no weapon for the soldier? Well, if you happen to have a stud shooter blaster (which you probably do, since they&#39;re so common nowadays) and a horizontal clip, you can store the blaster on the back of the buggy so the driver doesn&#39;t have to hold it while he&#39;s driving.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/9j9y00ipv/Buggy-_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4xdtrna1f/Attach_Gun.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>This is a great build and I had a lot of fun with it.</p>

<p>Now, we have Hawkeye&#39;s SUV. The car is not at all accurate to the movie but it is a cool build anyway.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/pua1wqvc3/SUV-_Front_Side.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The wheels are jacked up to give it the off-roader look. There are two stickers on this vehicle: a license plate (which was absent on the HYDRA buggy. I guess super-villains don&#39;t care about getting a ticket!) and a silver, 2x2 Avengers logo. Both are fairly easy to put on.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5zo0alsz7/SUV-_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Up on top of the SUV is a twin missile launcher. Not something you&#39;d see on a normal SUV. It comes off easy if you want a more highway-ready car.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5zo0all9f/SUV-_Side-_Launcher_Removed.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The light(s) above the windshield is made of a fence 1x4x1 and four trans-white studs. I thought that was really clever and it&#39;s definitely something to keep in mind when building MOCs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/xzs3uv1kj/SUV-_Front.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Inside the car is a spot for Hawkeye to drive, and even though it appears to have a passenger seat, it really doesn&#39;t unless you remove a few parts and do this:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/bp8u863tf/Thor_Riding.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
That&#39;s just kinda awkward, isn&#39;t it?&nbsp; There are clips on either side, one for Hawkeye&#39;s bow and one for a walkie-talkie. There&#39;s also some pieces to represent rearview mirrors. Despite the fact that the car isn&#39;t accurate, I really like it. It&#39;s cool looking, fairly sturdy and fun to vroom around. So...</p>

<p><br />
FINAL VERDICT<br />
Pros: Cool minifigures<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some great pieces<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awesome vehicles<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Decent price<br />
Cons: &nbsp;Not movie accurate<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thor has the wrong hair color<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Weird printing on the back of the HYDRA dude&#39;s head.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/nppov990j/Full_Set.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
Final notes: don&#39;t judge the set by it&#39;s non-accuracy. It&#39;s a great set to get for the minifigures or just a fun playset for younger kids. The vehicles aren&#39;t so bad for display either.<br />

<p><img src=""https://images.brickset.com/sets/small/76030-1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>So to start off, the builds are interesting. The Avengers car is pretty basic, and shares similarities to the one from the original Avengers line. The flick fire missiles&nbsp;on the top make for some playability, and the black color scheme works. The Hydra&nbsp;buggy is also nice. It has an okay design, with the white color scheme. It captures the look of a buggy, but it doesn&#39;t quite fit with Hydra. The cannon on the top in nice, but the antennae&nbsp;is useless and just gets in the way. So overall the builds are fine.</p>

<p>Next are the minifigures. We get the new Hawkeye, which looks great compared to the movie, and the Thor is also good to have. His face printing is great, and then we get the soft cape. The Hydra soldier is a cool figure, with the face and torso being new. They look perfect with the buggy, and it&#39;s a good movie adaptation of Hydra.</p>

<p>So overall, the set is pretty good, with okay builds, and good minifigs. It&#39;s a nice Age of Ultron set, and it&#39;s definitely worth the price. A very okay set.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The instructions are the normal size for a $20.00 Lego set. The dimensions for the box are 10.3x7.5x2.4 inches and weighs 0.8 lbs. The instructions are clear and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice parts in this set. You get a bow and a hammer for Hawkeye and Thor which are nice pieces to get. The big tires are nice to get.&nbsp;The total piece count is 220.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>You get 3 minifigures in this set: Thor, Hawkeye, and a Hydra Soldier.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Thor:</strong></p>

<p>Thor has a doubled sided head. Also has a soft cape and his hammer, mjolnir.&nbsp;The hair is okay (Should be more tan than yellow) The body printing is really good and he has no printing on his legs.</p>

<p><strong>Hawkeye:</strong></p>

<p>Hawkeye also has a doubled sided head. He comes with a black bow. I would have liked them to have given him an arrow sheath to go with the bow. He has printing of his red and black suit on his body and legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hydra Soldier:</strong></p>

<p>The Hydra Soldier has a single sided head with some weird&nbsp;Hydra tech on the back of his head. He does not come with a weapon (Wish they gave him a weapon.) Has printing on his body, which is really good. No printing on his pants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall these are very good figures for the price of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is not hard or difficult. It took me between 10-20 minutes to build. The set has 3 stickers. Both vehicles are different builds and are not the same. Overall an easy build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Both vehicles are really good. The Hydra buggy is a nice vehicle for Hydra and fits them well. It has a stud shooter on top and can come off as a play feature. You can open up the front of the buggy to put the Hydra soldier in as well. The Avenger Jeep is also really nice. It really fits what they use well. It has 2 flick missiles on the top. You can spin it 360 degrees. Their are spots for a radio and Hawkeye&#39;s bow on either side of the jeep. There is an opening on the top and both sides of the jeep for easy access to putting in a driver. Both of these are really nice and well done, especially for the price.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a very good set for 20 bucks. The figures are really good as are the vehicles. This is a good set from the Age of Ultron&nbsp;wave. The figures are really good, although I do wish they gave the Hydra Soldier a weapon. Otherwise this is a great set. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
