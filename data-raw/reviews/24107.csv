"roostercogburn","2015-03-09T05:37:44.473Z","More than the sum of it's parts.","<p>I went on a spree last week and bought the whole wave, minus that enormous helicarrier. I&#39;ve got horrible impulse control, a credit card, and a bit of a soft spot for Joss Whedon&nbsp;productions.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not the only one that felt this set was expensive though,&nbsp;was I? Inflation! And just remember, we asked for this...</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>There wasn&#39;t too much to the box. It had graphics of the four characters in the midst of a battle, and the back showed off some of the play features. It was bigger than I thought it would be however.</p>

<p>The instructions were straight forward, crisp and clear. There was also a neat little comic included,&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>There are quite a few &quot;hot rod red&quot; pieces, a quote from the first Iron Man, a few gray and black pieces, some technic, and a few gold pieces for high lights. If you&#39;re MOCing or using this for parts, there are many angled pieces, especially in the body, legs and Hulk-Holder, but there a large number of ball and socket joint pieces, that I think are mostly for robot/bionicle&nbsp;builds.</p>

<p>There are a few red hook/finger pieces, and a neat head piece (printed, and not a sticker!!!!) whose size is unique in my collection so far.</p>

<p>There are also some light blue highlight pieces, and a few red for Ultron, as wells as two light blue &quot;pistol&quot; pieces I&#39;ve never seen before. They&#39;re like halfway between Star Lord&#39;s guns and Electro/Storm lightning pieces.&nbsp;You also get a super jumper, so there&#39;s that.</p>

<p>Overall there are a good variety of pieces, but I can&#39;t really see them being super useful by themselves, but I plan on keeping the Hulkbuster together.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p><strong>MK43&nbsp;Iron Man</strong> - New prints, same old Iron Man. He has the same mask style, with a few new details (eye brows for example), new torso and limb printing, and uses the same shade of blue for his stabilizers.</p>

<p><strong>Ultron</strong> - This version looks a little beat up, and is dubbed the &quot;Ultimate Ultron&quot;. He is missing the top part of the helmet, but keeps the collar piece,&nbsp;from one of the other Ultrons&nbsp;(Quinjet), but isn&#39;t quite as destroyed as the other(Avengers&#39; Tower). The missing helmet can be stolen from one of the minions from the smallest set.<br />
<br />
Anyway, there are some very detailed head (one sided), torso and leg pieces, and sans helmet, matches up well with Iron Man, but with War Machine-esque red for his stabilizer colours.</p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Witch</strong> - A new character, who is entirely unique (and not just this version of her) to this set. She has Black Widow&#39;s old hair cut, unique printing on her torso and legs, and a cookie cutter female face on one side, and a possessed/angry red eyed version on the other. That one&#39;s not very Olsen-sister like.</p>

<p><strong>Hulk</strong> - NEW HULK! The new one isn&#39;t unique to this set, but the new body is olive green as opposed to a more electric green, has purple pants (the first Avengers&#39; version had brown), and other than that, he has the Ruffalo hair from the movies. For the uninitiated, Hulk is a big fig, and has the standard configuration of two 2x3 feet set apart with the left ahead of the right, two arms held on with technic pins, and two hands joined likewise.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build was split up in to three bags, and three sections.<br />
<br />
The first is the Hulk holder, which is relatively light for what it&#39;s supposed to do. It consists of three beams and two angled pieces with the larger wing tips attached, to make it look like it would be an octagon. The build was very fast and to the point.</p>

<p>The next two bags put the body, then the legs, then the arms of the Hulkbuster together. Not a lot of surprises, but the build was to the point. The body would be a SNOT technic if it were a base of attached to a base plate, the legs are a little bulkier then some similar sets. The arms have build in the stud shooters that are a recent addition to Lego action sets, and while I&#39;d have liked to see the spring loaded shooters on him some way, but that would be entirely infeasible given the size and style of the mech.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The set is a battle set. Apparently, being 2 months before Age of Ultron is released, Scarlet Witch and Ultron have teamed up to capture the Hulk, and Iron Man jumps the shark (after blowing up all his toys in the previous movie) and makes a bigger, better suit. Boom, there&#39;s your background to the new play set.</p>

<p>For AFOLs, or TFOLs, that don&#39;t want a play set though, it makes a heck of a display piece.</p>

<p>Looking at the set, it all seems a little lacking for the price I paid ($39.99 Canadian, 29.99 in Pounds/American Dollars). Hulkbuster is off balance if he isn&#39;t set up juuuuuusssstttt right. There are hole in the armour where the figure is visible. Scarlet Witch&#39;s clear antenna piece will only let her fly in one direction.</p>

<p>I think I was a little disappointed because I built this set up in my head as being the best of the launch without ever seeing it. Also, all the talk about Hulkbuster being heavier or sturdier than other mechs built it up to be better.</p>

<p>It all still looks neat, I just wouldn&#39;t leave the price tag on it.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>So this was a bit of a let down for me. I figured for forty dollars I&#39;d be getting a few more elements to play with, but then I also thought &quot;this is exactly what I wanted&quot;. With the Helicarrier break out, I thought it was too big, and asked why we couldn&#39;t get more included, or more different/less common minifigures. Yeah, you got Loki, Hawkeye, Thor and the first available Hulk, but you also got a set that had a lot of elements of the Helicarrier crammed together, and a jet that offered playability, and was well built, but felt it should have been part a different set, even if I did enjoy it&#39;s inclusion.<br />
<br />
Then we have the next Hulk set, the Hulk Lab Smash. I got my wish, and was thrilled. We got three brand new figures, two with distinctive or unique molds, a new version of Thor and a new, properly pant-coloured Hulk. Lego even ditched the extra piece and gave us an awesome lab full of destructible elements, more missles to fire, more to do, and then people complained about the price.</p>

<p>This year we got not one, but two, Hulk sets. This is the cheaper of the two, and as such, it&#39;s not going to be as feature or piece rich as other sets. Value is still a mark against it, as I feel without Hulk and the Hulk holder, it&#39;s a $25 dollar set (similar to, for example, Lex Luthor&#39;s mech from a few years ago). However, even with the set not being perfect, we get Hulk for less then the usual price. We also get, what according to every ad I&#39;ve seen for the movie, what is an iconic moment, some extra play function/exposition, a unique character, a distinct version of another, and someone to help Hulk escape, then fight. A small car/truck would have been neat, but I can see the price soaring with another 20-30 piece car.&nbsp;Licensing isn&#39;t cheap, neither are new molds (for the hair), but this is the cheapest set to include a big fig since...fantasy era castle(?)&nbsp;and frankly, I think Hulkbuster looks great riding my AT-AT from one of my last trips to the Lego store.</p>

<p>The only beef I have that I can&#39;t justify or rationalize is splitting up the twins (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver), and then including Hulk in both sets! 4/5. Grumble grumble, I&#39;ll never be happy with Hulk sets.</p>

"Binnekamp","2015-08-04T23:49:52.017Z","The hulk buster: a worthy super hero mech set?","<p>Recently I got into collecting the various mechs from Lego. The Hulkbuster won me over because I also sought to get an Iron-Man minifigure ever since the first Avengers movie came out (preferably with a round ARC reactor). With this set I also got one of the Olson twins and Ultron himself. What&#39;s not to like? So i went to see the movie, I got the set at a slight discount and built the set after when the time felt right. Did it live up to my expectations? How accurate is it to Age of Ultron? Was it worth it? And can you learn from my experience?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Instructions are clear to follow. No remarks on the box. There is also a comic book included that show the sets of Age of Ultron in action. This ties into the actual film very loosely.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts mostly consist of dark red slopes and oddities, some blueish grey for the &#39;hulk trap&#39;, and transparant parts. Of note are the dark red CCBS/hero factory shells, the new stud shooters that can be affixed to plates, the uncommon parts Scarlet Witch is holding from Galaxy Squad and some trmediumblue skeleton arms with horizontal grip, which I presume are exclusive to this set. Also of note is that the dome piece used for the Hulkbusters face is printed. The flaps on the hulk trap are not. Those can be useful for space mocs, as they are in light bluish grey and can be left unstickered.</p>

<p>The set also includes a super jumper. Unlike with most sets, here it won&#39;t pose a risk to your minifigures legs. Why? Because it works mostly fine when the figure stands on the transparant cilinders under Iron-Man and Ultron Prime. Those can be removed easily, and haven&#39;t shown any sign of wear on mine. It doesn&#39;t jump as well, but it might be used as a stand if you desire. Speaking of those cilinder parts, both Iron-Man and Ultron come with a spare 1x1 round brick and 1x1 round plate, as pictured.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>These are all great figures. The prints are superb and it&#39;s thrilling to own these characters. They add a great deal to the set, and some of them feel like a bonus. Ultron Prime never fought the Hulkbuster, nor did Scarlet Witch. However, they were somewhat important for the scene and with them, the set feels like it gives you the opportunity to immediately expand the set beyond a mere battle as it&#39;s set out to be. So, they are a huge plus, especially as I didn&#39;t really buy it because I had to have them.<br />
Still, I will deal mostly with accuracy, as for a movie tie-in that&#39;s quite important, isn&#39;t it? Off course, it doesn&#39;t mean the world, but it does matter if they will feel like the character they represent.</p>

<h3>Ultron Prime</h3>

<p><img alt="""" height=""141"" src=""http://i.ytimg.com/vi/to34lq7coNs/maxresdefault.jpg"" width=""252"" /><img alt="""" height=""204"" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/sh175.jpg"" width=""152"" /> Prime</p>

<p><img alt="""" height=""146"" src=""http://media.comicbook.com/uploads1/2015/01/ultron-model-117604.jpg"" width=""234"" /><img alt="""" height=""202"" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/sh176.jpg"" width=""151"" /> Ultimate (not included in this set)</p>

<p>Our first exclusive figure. Not to be confused with a certain other humanoid robot that keeps being issued with a new appearance and is also called Prime, Ultron Prime is basically Ultron&#39;s second form. I&#39;ve made a comparison with the next form of Ultron, Ultimate Ultron. In this lies a major gripe I have with this figure.</p>

<p>As you can see, the movie versions look very similar in regards to their heads. Ultimate Ultron is basically a lighter shade of metal, but that&#39;s about it! This is not the lighting on the photos, they really are consistently a different tone. The lego versions... not so much. The Ultron Prime figure uses a standard minifgure head to represent Ultrons bald look and uses a neck part to represent his side &#39;horns&#39;. As you can see, this makes his lower jaw look huge compared to his face. His red eyes are spot on, but his cheeks don&#39;t light up too...<br />
Ultimate Ultron uses a different design by using a helmet to complete his face. This makes his head more balanced, albeit slighlty larger than a regular head. He also looks less emotive. On the source material, Ultimate Ultron looks slightly more human, but that&#39;s of varying opinion. Otherwise they look the same, unlike their minifigures.</p>

<p>The thing is, why did they do two different takes on the same design? I don&#39;t like how Lego made two figures that both feel incomplete due to the other. If Lego just stuck to one design for his head it would make much more sense.</p>

<p>&quot;Then why not add the helmet from the Iron man vs. Ultron set?&quot;, you might ask?<br />
That will look like this:</p>

<p><img alt="""" height=""188"" src=""http://i.ytimg.com/vi/4VvMbL5Ab50/maxresdefault.jpg"" width=""251"" /></p>

<p>As you can see, there is no head detail anymore due to the unprinted helmet, and he still has his eyes and red cheek lights. He still feels like a different take on the same appearance. And you have to buy another set for that.</p>

<p>Head design aside, his prints are otherwise accurate and he looks good, just not that great his neck part on. The red lights look especially awesome. Unsurprisingly, his parts make great parts for any robot or other sci-fi fig, as they won&#39;t scream &quot;ULTRON!&quot; when you would use them (except the head perhaps).<br />
The armor comes with transparent red 1x1 round plates and bricks to act as repulsors, and you get a spare of each</p>

<p>All in all, a mixed bag as a whole with great details and usability.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Scarlet Witch</h3>

<p><img alt="""" height=""175"" src=""http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news_img/67966/Inhumans_67966.jpg"" width=""345"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/sh174.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 267px;"" /></p>

<p>The second exclusive figure. In a way, Scarlet Witch has been captured quite well in Lego form. her outfit, necklace and even red eyes are accurate. Her face is quite bland, to be honest. I&#39;m surprised they didn&#39;t give her cheek lines, although it&#39;s understandable they chose not to. However, her hairpiece doesn&#39;t quite do it for me. It&#39;s reddish brown and the shape is still Elsa Schneiders&#39;. During dark scenes it almost felt black, and should be dark brown at most. I know it&#39;s a relatively stock hairpiece, but it&#39;s slightly disappointing, although not that big of a deal.<br />
She has pieces as accessories to represent her &#39;hex&#39; energy. They were first issued in trmedium blue, and they are still this color. However, her hexes look red in the source material.</p>

<p>Her parts are probably useful for customizing. All in all, she&#39;s relatively accurate and useful, although as a whole, I&#39;m not sure if it fully evokes the character.</p>

<h3>Iron man (Mark 43)</h3>

<p><img alt="""" height=""289"" src=""http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/9/97/AOU_Wall_Decor_07.png/revision/latest?cb=20150210025549"" width=""205"" /><img alt="""" height=""231"" src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xpa1/t31.0-8/11133887_665865496872481_3901067168422673016_o.jpg"" width=""381"" /><img alt="""" height=""266"" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/sh167.jpg"" width=""201"" /></p>

<p>Iron man has once again built himself a new suit. The suit is used throughout most of the film except for the final battle, but most notably during the Hulkbuster fight scene. The Hulkbuster armor attaches on this suit. I think, based on the reference picture, that it looks quite accurate. It also looks better than the armors from the sets from the previous Avengers film, as it&#39;s more detailed on both the faceplate and on the prints. Red printing is used to evoke a shine for the red metal coating. However, compared to more recent iron man figures, such as the heartbreaker suit, this suit looks suitably tame in comparison (pun intended).<br />
The armor comes with trmediumblue 1x1 round plates and bricks to act as repulsors, and you get a spare of each.</p>

<p>In short, I think the MK43 suit looks good, but not exceptionally so. However, it appears fully accurate. His parts can be used for mor generic sci-fi figs (except the helmet, obviously). Finally, you can never have enough Iron Men, right?</p>

<h3>Hulk&nbsp; (Age of Ultron)</h3>

<p><img alt="""" height=""214"" src=""http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/sites/default/files/2015/05/avengers_age_of_ultron_the_hulk_still.jpg"" width=""404"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt="""" height=""281"" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/sh173.jpg"" width=""211"" /></p>

<p>The incredible Hulk is back! With a new haircut and pants! And he has tanned?! The hulk has&nbsp; been issued in olive green. I think this is a more accurate color to the movie version of the character. I think the same of his hair. I&#39;m not sure if the pants appear in the movie or not. I wasn&#39;t too fixated on it ;). The best reference i could find was a shot of an early scene where he has different pants, but many toys and figures also feature the red stripes. Maybe it&#39;s like with the first Black Widow figure and they had to base this figure on concept art.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this figure has been an improvement on the earlier hulk figures visually. However, I don&#39;t own those in the flesh so I cannot tell you for sure.</p>

<p>An important note is that, being a bigfig, the Hulk will drive up the retail price of the set. Note that this set as a whole will be worth it more if you also want this figure. I will talk about this in more detail at the end.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You start with the Hulk trap, then the torso/head of the Hulkbuster, and finally the limbs. SNOT techniques are used on the Hulkbuster, although there aren&#39;t any noteworthy or challanging parts to the build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Hulk Trap</p>

<p>The hulk trap does appear in the film. It&#39;s used to trap the Hulk temporarily to buy time for Tony Stark to suit up with the Hulkbuster. It was basically four pillars shot into the ground around the hulk with iron plating coming out to connect them. The Lego version looks suitably like that due to the stickers on the panels. They represent it well, as do the three slopes to represent the pillars. However, it&#39;s merely half of the trap and feels very unfinished, even when not taking the source material as a reference. If you did, you will also notice that in the film it completely encased the Hulk for the time being, whereas the Lego version only &#39;traps&#39; his waist. This is acceptable, giving that it&#39;s just an extra to the Hulkbuster suit right? I&#39;ll return to this later.</p>

<p>A playfeature is added by a transparant clear bar that rest on a technic connector that allows you to swing it back. You can mount Scarlet Witch on it to make it look like she floats and uses her Hexes on the Hulk. You can shoot her with the super jumper or with the arm cannons on the Hulkbuster, after which she swings back. Although not appearing in the movie this way, this actually makes for a better display of the hulk trap, as you can make it look like the hulks upper half is still contained this way. I like that you can also decide to play &#39;free the Hulk&#39; in addition to &#39;stop/battle the Hulk&#39; this way, and I admit it makes for a fun target practice.</p>

<p>Therefore, the hulk trap makes for a good complimentary model to the Hulkbuster and enhances playability, although it&#39;s not accurate and feels unfinished.</p>

<p>The Hulk Buster</p>

<p>Some superhero sets have to think up a vehicle to make it an actual set, but not this one! The Hulkbuster has been highly anticipated and although both the Lego Marvel Superheroes game gave it the bigfig treatment (as did clone companies that sell figures on their own), Lego decided to give the gigantic armor the brick-built treatment. As I said, it would be unlike Lego not to make it buildable, and as a result it&#39;s quite poseable and offers more playability than a bigfig. Therefore, I&#39;m quite happy with this. As I mentioned, I like lego mechs.</p>

<p>Then how does the model turn out? Is it bulkier than previous mechs, as rumored? Well, in a sense it is. It looks just as bulky in real life as on the photos. The legs in particular feel well rounded and complete, as do the upper arms and front. However, it&#39;s shorter than I anticipated. It&#39;s only slightly larger than 70500-1: Kai&#39;s Fire Mech and smaller than 21109-1: Exo-Suit (even minus its antenna and shoulder things) and roughly the same size as&nbsp;70754-1: ElectroMech, just with more (front) armor. Some people call it too large for it&#39;s scale. I think that depends.</p>

<p><img alt="""" height=""275"" src=""http://www.flickeringmyth.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/avengers-size-chart-600x307.jpg"" width=""539"" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the Hulkbuster isn&#39;t just the same size, its bigger. However, its unclear how much bigger, as the Lego Hulk is crouched whilst the Hulkbuster can be posed in different positions. I&#39;m not an expert on the supposed size, but the set doesn&#39;t feel too big to me. After all, the Hulkbuster can only match or even overpower the Hulk&#39;s strength by being larger and heavier. In that it succeeds.</p>

<p>On the Lego set the front can flip open. This makes for a nice play-feature and makes it easier to put Iron-man in and out of the suit. The drawback is that there are slight gaps on the side. However, this is only apparent when you look for it or when you have a figure inside that is not Iron-Man. I apreciate the flaps on the &#39;waist&#39; that give it interesting angles and covers most of these gaps up but the lowest bit of the sides.The shoulders seen at an angle are also part of that flip-open front. I like them. they give the model interesting angles and look like thee ones on the actual Hulkbuster.</p>

<p>I personally love that the head/helmet of the suit can open up like a tank lid. Due to the aforementioned trmediumblue skeleton arms that hold that helmet/head, it has two hinges. This allows you to swing it open in a very natural way, as you can draw the helmet/head slightly back while opening it, not unlike the regular sized Iron-Man helmet faceplate in the movies. Of course, it doesn&#39;t slide all the way back, but it still looks cooler then when a singe hinge was used. Tony Stark can lift his visor/faceplate of the MK 43 inside and the head/helmet of the Hulkbuster can still close comfortably. However, Iron-Man does not fit inside with his boosters (trmediumblue 1x1 round bricks) on.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it has some details on the back. It has two hinges with two (four total) transparent medium blue 1x1 round plates on the back, facing inwards to each other, creating a grove on the back. Otherwise the back is just black plates and wedge plates and some dark bluish grey structural plates. The short version: it barely has any details on the back and is nearly monochrome.</p>

<p>The legs only hinge at the hips and feet and are angled to make it look like the Hulkbuster is crouching. This is quite common in modern Lego mechs. However, in this case I think the &quot;feet&quot; are perhaps also meant to represent the lower leg, as they are relatively quite tall. A lovely detail is that each foot has two trmediumblue 1x1 round bricks next to each other to represent powerful feet repulsors (rockets?)</p>

<p>This is also done with the hands, which have trmediumblue &#39;boat stud&#39; parts on the palms tor represent hand trusters. The upper arms are CCBS (hero-factory) parts. The lower arms differ, as one side as dual wrist launchers of trmediumblue 1x1 round bricks with pearl gold 1x1 round plates on them. The other side has pearlgold curved bricks. That free hand is accurate to the source, but the other side does it differently. Although a fun play feature, this makes for an asymmetric build. It&#39;s nothing that can&#39;t be modded, though and is an understandable thing to do. Please note that the ammo might get lost (although you get one spare). Finally, the Hulkbuster has two funcional hands.</p>

<p>The Hulkbuster poses exceptionally well. I&#39;ve collected my fair share of Lego mech sets, and as far as a mech this size goes that has no knee joints, its brilliantly poseable! I daresay it doesn&#39;t even need knee joints due to the way they are bent. being the Hulkbuster, it wouldn&#39;t have stood with straigt legs anyway, and it really makes it look heavier, sturdier and stronger.</p>

<p>This makes the Hulkbuster very playable as well, as it doesn&#39;t go into wierd poses easily and looks good in nearly any pose you can come uo with. It&#39;s very sturdy and can probably survive a rough play (watch out for the missles though, they tend to get lost).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I came for a mech set with Superheroes as a bonus. When I built it and was finished, it felt slightly unsubstantial. Even though I bought it at a slight mark-down, it still felt that I should expect more for the price, even when it&#39;s licensed. There are some gaps at the sides in what should cover the man inside completely and the back is mostly bare and colorless, save one detail. The front however is superb, and really looks strong and armored.The hulk trap looks incomplete and small, although the option of hovering Scarlet Witch above it makes it seem less so. However, my major gripe is the small size of the Hulkbuster. It&#39;s built like a mech, but compared to others its so short. It&#39;s slightly more armored, but at the front only. As far as the figures go, Ultron&#39;s design feels a but off, and Scarlet Witch also feels a bit off due to her hair, but I really like the MK 43 armor and the Hulk. If anything, the first two figures are a bonus, as they only appeared in the scene before the actual Hulk battle.</p>

<p>So should you get it? If you want it, you need to know that the price is probably high both due to licenses to Marvel and Disney and because of the Hulk bigfig. It really raises the price a lot! Note that you will need to keep that in mind. Having kept that in mind I can live with the price. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the set offers three good minifigures, a bigfig, a short but bulky mech and a platform. Plus, it is not any giant suit of armor, it&#39;s the HULKBUSTER and the HULK. Therefore, I&#39;ll tell you this. Do you want the figs? Consider bricklink/ebay if you don&#39;t want a(nother?) Hulk bigfig, or buy another set with the MK 43 armor if you want that one. Do you want the Hulkbuster? Know you will have to buy the Hulk with it.</p>

<p>So overall, the set has its flaws, but they aren&#39;t that big a deal and are no game breakers for the set itself.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Impressive box art, so impressive in fact that i picked it up without realizing that Scarlet Witch was also included in the set! As for references to the movie, I&nbsp;guess all the characters are relevant. As with the Hulkbuster vs Hulk scene, the events that lead up to that were Scarlet witch mind-altering Banner (and thus becoming a raging Hulk), and Stark/Ironman having destroyed the main vessel of Ultron before veering off and trying to calm things down, realizing that he can&#39;t rely on Black Widow to soothe the Hulk back to Banner.</p>

<p>Instructions are straight forward and comes in 1 booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>a clear long piece that holds Scarlet Witch atop of the &quot;captured&quot; Hulk. Lots of useful mech ball-joint parts and maroon colored parts and of course! that printed Hulk buster dome/head.</p>

<p>Hulk busters upper arm is built using herofactory type parts and while i&#39;m not a fan of it, it does seem to blend in pretty well to the set</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>3&nbsp;minifigures, 1 large figure and a mech&nbsp;suit. Ironman MK43&nbsp;is a common minifigure but is movie accurate. The Hulk is much improved in color tones from the 2012 wave version, and is the typical large minifig. he is also obtainable in 76041. Ultron prime and Scarlet Witch are unique to this set. all minifigures have printed legs and double sided head prints (double faces for the case of Scarlet Witch and Stark/Ironman). if there was a complain, it would be that Scarlet Witches&#39; hair piece is of the common variant.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The Hulk holding pen is straight forward. The Hulk buster is pretty similar to most mech builds, and has a &quot;cavity&quot; to hold Ironman, who is supposed to be controlling the suit. The part where the front chest piece gets attached @ the rotatable hinge @ the bottom and is able to flip up and latch onto the upper part impressed me. it is also a great play feature where not only u lift the head piece of the hulk buster in an attempt to remove Ironman/minifig inside, you could also &quot;unlock&quot; the chest piece downwards to reveal the whole figure inside. I know my kid had such a fun time and kept on repeating the process on it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Impressive for a small lego&nbsp;set. Although the Hulk Buster suit does not have some of the weaponry the movie has, a mech of this size did pull of the looks to a very good effect (if not some of the features as well, e.g. helm/headpiece, front armor attachment, &quot;cannons&quot;). Couple it with the minifgs and the Hulk, it really hit the nail for me.</p>

<p>Playability, u get all the fun action poses with the hulk buster mech, as well as the jumper feature (i actually had Ultron placed on it, as it was a loose minifig) and you could actually use it to launch up and knock Scarlet Witch down (and thus assumingly in the Lego-verse of this set, have the Hulk not be mind controlled anymore).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set! Even if you were looking for unique avengers minifigs (like i was), this is a must get not only because of Scarlet witch, but the hulk buster suit as well (not to mention the set-unique Ultron prime). A must get for Avengers fans who are into Lego.</p>

"Professor_X","2015-11-03T21:50:47.983Z","I am Iron Man...","<p>When I first saw the set images for The Avengers: Age of Ultron I got really excited about all of them, but me and many others were convinced that the one set they couldn&rsquo;t live without was The Hulk buster. Is all the hype about this set worth listening to? or is this set a pass-over. Read on to find out&hellip;</p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>The build is made up of 3 parts; The minifigures (+ The Hulk big figure), A containment unit for the Hulk, and obviously, The Hulk Buster. A super jumper, &nbsp;spare ammo for The Hulk Buster, and a small sticker sheet are also included, with an Age of Ultron-themed comic included loose in the box. While I built this fast because I was so anxious to see it, this set was my first mech since the old Exo-Force theme, so it was definetly a memorable build for that reason.</p>

<h3>The Minifigures:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Ultron Prime:</h4>

<p>When I first saw this minifigure, I was really disappointed. I didn&rsquo;t look anything like the Ultron I had been seeing in the trailers, but now that I actually have it&hellip; I still think it&rsquo;s ugly. From the neck down Ultron Prime is fantastic. His color scheme is almost completely gunmetal-grey which looks great next to the silver highlights and specks of red printed on his body. His head piece, however is terrible. Ultron Prime, quite honestly has a humongous mouth, and the neck bracket which simulates the Ultron &lsquo;ears&rsquo; makes the head look extremely unfinished. Ultron Prime is armed with trans-red studs and trans-red cylinder pieces to mimic his own version of repulsors/thrusters, which give him an appropriate similarity to his creator, Iron Man.</p>

<h4>Scarlet Witch:</h4>

<p>Wanda Maximoff&rsquo;s minifigure appears to based off of her appearance during the final battle in Sokovia. While her design is fairly simple, this&nbsp;minifigure has really grown on me.&nbsp;Her red jacket contrasts very well with her black dress underneath, and you can tell who it is from a glance. Her head is double sided, one side with a half smile, while the other side is very angry with bright red eyes for when she&rsquo;s using her powers. Scarlet Witch uses the same hair as many other female minifigures including the original Black Widow minifigure. I really wish the designer had used a brown version of Ginny Weasley&rsquo;s hair from the Harry Potter theme, but this hair does just fine. Scarlet Witch is armed with two strange pieces that I assume mimic energy blasts, although they are trans-light blue for some reason instead of trans-red.</p>

<h4>Iron Man:</h4>

<p>Based on the MK 43 armor that he&rsquo;s seen in for most of the movie, Tony Stark&rsquo;s latest suit is the most detailed yet, mixing just the right amount of gold and silver highlights in with the dark red base color. It&rsquo;s always fun to study minifigures as detailed as this Iron Man, picking out all the detailed armor segments and styling used all over. Iron Man uses the original Tony Stark head from the sets based on the first Avengers movie, one side with a half smile and the other with an angry expression. He still uses the same helmet/visor piece as he has in the past, although his visor has a couple of revisions, the most noticeable being the extra lining printed on it. Iron Man as usual is equipped with trans- light blue studs and cylinders to represent his repulsors/thrusters, though I think that trans- dark orange would make more sense.</p>

<h3>The Completed Set:</h3>

<h4>The Hulk:</h4>

<p>Coming in five pieces, the Hulk has been dramatically revised since his first lego appearance, with a completely new body mold. His hair is a much different mold, mimicking Mark Ruffalo&rsquo;s hair pretty well, and The hulk face has of course been printed with an angry expression. His skin tone has been updated to a much more realistic olive green, and he has been given purple pants like he had in the movie, although I don&rsquo;t remember all the lining or the Avengers logo on them.</p>

<h4>Hulk&rsquo;s Containment unit:</h4>

<p>While I remember what Iron Man used to try and contain the Hulk when they were fighting in Wakanda, this piece-filling containment unit looks nothing like it. The only useful things about this little model to me are the angled stickered wing pieces used to create the containment unit&rsquo;s odd shaping, and the large see-through bar piece attached to the back. Scarlet Witch can be attached to this piece so that you can launch a minifigure from the super jumper to try and knock her down. This is a bit of an odd feature to me as Scarlet Witch can&rsquo;t fly (so far), but it is nonetheless a fun feature to play around with.</p>

<h4>The Hulk Buster:</h4>

<p>The Hulk Buster is one of my favorite super hero models of all time, combining the coolness and poseability that everybody looks for in a mech. While it is obviously a lot bulkier than your average mech, This in no way inhibits the poseability of the MK XLIV, it&rsquo;s weight, &nbsp;If anything, helping it to balance better than other mechs. Lots of great details have been captured all over this thing; repulsors on the palms, thrusters on its feet and back, and of course the brand new printed dome piece which mimics the Hulk Buster&rsquo;s head perfectly. My favorite part of this model though, is the way you put Iron Man into it. Not only can you open the helmet, but the entire chest hinges forward as well! While there are a few gaps on the sides of the body, the opening chest more than compensates for that in my opinion. Mounted on the Hulk Buster&rsquo;s left hand are twin stud shooters(or cylinder shooters in this case) which, even though inaccurate, are really fun to launch and don&rsquo;t look out of place whatsoever. The only major criticism I have&nbsp;about this set is that the technic bars connecting the legs to the body stick out quite a bit, and at certain angles they&nbsp;look a bit strange.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>

<p>While the minifigures aren&rsquo;t quite as interesting to me as other Age of Ultron sets, this set is not only the cheapest way to get the Hulk (or any big figure for that matter), but contains an amazing model which represents a stand-out scene in the movie. Whether you&rsquo;re a mech lover, Iron Man fan, or just somebody looking for a cool display piece this is the set for you. at 248 pieces, $39.99(CA)/29.99(US) this set is pretty expensive, most likely due to the inclusion of a big figure. However, the playability and amazing design of the Hulk Buster&nbsp;more than makes up for this, and I would definitely recommend this set.</p>
",TRUE,3,3,3,3,3
"Echolord","2016-05-03T12:15:07.597Z","Hulk vs Hulkbuster = Awesome!","<p>As soon as I saw Age of Ultron I knew I needed this set. The set just looked amazing, and really accurate to the scene it came from in the movie. The two builds looked fantastic, as did the minifigures, which is a given with a Marvel set. This set looks great in any collection of Iron Man suits, and is a must have.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a simple, average size box, but a bit small, considering the size of the set. The piece bags are kind of stuffed in there.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Of note, I can only come up with three parts to touch on here, that could be considered really nice to have. First off, we have the very obvious Hulkbuster helmet, which I believe is a new mold, and exclusive to this set. The printing on this piece is extraordinary, leaving nothing to be desired. The gold and white print just looks amazing, and is the keystone to this entire set. The Ultron Neck armor thing isn&#39;t that great of a piece, and it kind of looks out of place on a minifigure unless you have the helmet to go with it. It is a very cool mold, with some great shapes incorporated into it, but it just isn&#39;t good on this minifig. Finally, this set comes with a long transparent rod to fly Scarlet Witch on, and is very useful for a number of things, even outside of this set. In my opinion, you can&#39;t have too many of these.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Iron Man MK 43:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This minifigure is the most commonly released throughout the Age of Ultron wave, with three total sets (76031, 76032, and 76038). However, that does not make him any less awesome. This was my first set with the Iron Man helmet and mask, and I love the design of the pieces. The printing on the mask shows the gold face plate, with white eyes, and some black lines to represent the indents on his helmet in the movie. There is a little bit of dark red on the sides of the mask, where it joins with the helmet. The helmet itself is a plain, dark red Iron Man helmet, which is an extraordinary piece in my opinion. I think this mask might be the best Iron Man mask LEGO has made yet. The torso has a circular ARC reactor in the center, printed in white, with black and gold printing around it to depict the armor. The design also features some dark stone grey tones on the back, and some on the front, to add another layer of detail to the Iron Man suit. The legs match perfectly with the torso, and continue the armor printing onto the hip piece, and the front of the legs. The head is the standard Tony Stark head, which first appeared in 2012, on the Iron Man MK 6 and 7 minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ultron Prime:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This minifigure is exclusive to this set, and is a great addition. The armor is very similar to that of the Sub-Ultron soldier and officer minifigures in 76029 Iron Man vs. Ultron. The head has some red highlights, along with some gunmetal, and dark grey detailing, on a gunmetal color head. Some white detailing is also included on the red, giving it a glowing effect, which looks really cool. The torso has a bit more armor than the soldier, with some better detailing, in a more complex pattern, with some red and white detailing in some places. The torso really makes this &nbsp;minifigure accurate to the movie, with the awesome back print, and the front print. The legs are the same as the Sub-Ultron Soldiers, and though simple, looks great. This minifigure includes the neck piece I discussed earlier, though it makes the minifigure look really weird. I would suggest using the helmet piece from 76029 if you want to use the neck piece.</p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Witch:</strong></p>

<p>Also exclusive to this set, Scarlet Witch is incredibly accurate to the movie, with some great printing. Her head first showed up on Supergirl in 76040 Brainiac Attack, and has a smiling, peaceful expression, and a face with an angry expression, with glowing red eyes to represent the magic she uses. &nbsp;Her hair is nothing new, but looks great on the minifigure. Her torso is very well printed, showing her black dress, with a red jacket over it. She has dark space filled in on the sides of the torso to give her appearance a feminine shape. Her legs continue the skirt, with the hem printed, and flesh showing at knee level. She includes blue laser elements for some reason. Her magic was red in the movie, not blue, so I do not understand this decision on LEGO&#39;s part here.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is broken up into three parts: The Hulk Cage, the Hulkbuster torso, and then the arms and legs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><strong>Hulk Cage:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Hulk fits in the cage relatively well, with some slight manipulation of the side panels. Hulk&#39;s new color and detailing is much better than that of his Avengers and Avengers Assemble variants, and looks a lot more accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Mk 44: The Hulkbuster:</strong></p>

<p>This thing is amazing. It stands about 6 inches tall, and has some extraordinary detailing, and playability. All of the detail, except for the helmet, is done entirely with LEGO elements, no stickers are used in this model. The translucent Blue elements add a great level of detail to this set, by letting the hands &quot;glow&quot; and the arc reactor look really good. The one thing I do not like about this is the stud shooters on the right arm, which look really out of place, and there are no pieces to replace this.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is awesome. I have nothing more to say. Get it. It&#39;s definitely worth it.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T16:01:17.977Z","HULKBUSTER SMASH!","<p><strong>Set #76031 The Hulk Buster Smash:</strong> One of the most iconic moments of Age of Ultron was the reveal for the Hulkbuster armor from Iron Man and this set is definitely one of the must own sets from the Theme if you&rsquo;re only looking for MCU staples for your collection.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: This is one of few Super Heroes boxes that is designed to stand sideways on the shelf, the box design reflects this with everything running from end-to-end via the opening flaps on the top and bottom&hellip; Or lengthwise instead of witdthwise to be precise. The images really do a great shop showing off the set in action on the front and all of the fun features on the back, including of course the NEW Super Jumper!</p>

<p>Instructions: One manual in this set which is well designed, you get three numbered bags in this set and the manual breaks up the build between these three bags, it works quite well as each step is relatively easy to follow. The manual also includes the parts list at the end and the image showing off most of the other sets in this sub-theme.</p>

<p>Comic: This details the events of Age of Ultron as told through the sets released by LEGO, so some things are missing from the main plot. You&rsquo;ll also find a quick Minifigure checklist on the back cover.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>So many nice maroon parts in this set, great for fans of that colour, the rest are fairly common, there&rsquo;s also some Constraction parts in this set for some of the build and a few Ice Tribe blue skeleton arms from Legends of Chima. The printed dome piece with Hulk Buster&rsquo;s head detailing is a great looking part too.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Hulk: Hulk is pretty much the same as we&rsquo;ve seen before, however his sculpt has been modified to fix the look of his hair, he&rsquo;s more screen-accurate now and his skin tone has been darkened appropriately, he also has new printing on his purple shorts with the Avengers logo. A great update to the character from the MCU.</p>

<p>Iron Man Mk43: This is the Mark 43 armour and its print is&hellip; well it&rsquo;s pretty much what you&rsquo;d expect from Iron Man by this point. He&rsquo;s double-sided with the torso, has highly detailed leg printing and includes the helmet piece we&rsquo;ve seen since 2012. This version is found in three sets and is the armour most worn by Iron Man during the movie. Tony&rsquo;s face is the same as always.</p>

<p>Scarlet Witch: Wearing a coat over a black dress, Wanda looks great, her torso is a double-sided print and she&rsquo;s got a little necklace on around her neck, her skirt is printed on her legs along with the bare legs above her ankles, which unfortunately are a bit inconsistent as far as skin tones are concerned. She has a double-sided head with one side showing her using her powers as her eyes are glowing red and the other is just a regular happy expression.</p>

<p>For accessories she has two new pieces that represent her power bolts, I have no idea what they are called officially, but they remind me of some weird bladed weapons rather than energy projectiles. LEGO had to represent her powers somehow though.</p>

<p>Ultron Prime: It&rsquo;s Ultron&rsquo;s next form, he&rsquo;s got a highly detailed looking print which shows off all of the unique details from the character as seen in Age of Ultron. He&rsquo;s got a new neck bracket piece that is part of his helmeted head design, for some reason the helmet is not included with this version. He also has red energy blasts represented by dark red cylinders and two studs. He&rsquo;s using repulsor energy to fly just like Iron Man, only it&rsquo;s evil red.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: Scarlet Witch and The Hulk are in this bag as well as the few pieces used to make the Hulk Containment device. This was much bigger in the film and actually sealed the Hulk up in a large metallic tube thing, here LEGO has managed to make a fairly unbelievable little model that definitely wouldn&rsquo;t work well to contain the Hulk. The build is pretty quick, the trickiest part is just placing the stickers on properly.</p>

<p>Bag 2: This is the bulk of the parts use, you&rsquo;ll find Iron Man and the Hulk Buster armour in this bag and boy is the build for the Hulk Buster a lot of fun. Since it is broken up between two bags however you&rsquo;ll be left with a torso once you finish this just lying around waiting for you to finish the arms and legs.</p>

<p>Bag 3: Ultron Prime starts off the build here and then you get to make all of the legs and arms. Which makes this the most repetitive of builds as man steps are mirrored or identical between the Hulk Buster&rsquo;s limbs.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Hulk Containment Device: This is a terribly inaccurate looking device, and for some reason as part of the play feature you have the Scarlet Witch or Ultron Prime hovering over the Hulk on a clear rod that is easily knocked over even without using the Super Jumper with Iron Man. I suppose in order to include all of the characters this was necessary just to let younger builders have something to play with, but honestly I think I would have preferred a more screen-accurate containment device without the silly Super Jumper play feature.</p>

<p>Hulk Buster: This is the real reason to pick up this set, the Hulk Buster is a brilliantly designed upscaled version of Iron Man&rsquo;s regular armour so he can go toe to toe with the Hulk and this LEGO version is just brilliant. It does have a few minor issues though, one hand includes stud launchers that include three ammo pieces using clear blue cylinder pieces to be repulsor energy projectiles.</p>

<p>The other issue is the hip joints are attached to a LEGO Technic axle and that axle just is too long, it sticks out more than it should once you finish the model and I am seriously not a fan of how it interferes with the smooth/streamlined look of the armour.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is a must have set, the price is perfect, the model is stand out and the only way to get AoU Scarlet Witch and Ultron Prime is with this set. I recommend this as one of the sets you can&rsquo;t do without from the Marvel Super Heroes theme, the Hulk Buster probably won&rsquo;t be seen again, so you definitely don&rsquo;t want to miss out on this set.</p>

"JellyBeanie","2016-07-23T16:49:55.823Z","INCREDIBLY AWESOME!!","<p>Good day, Bricksetters! I, JellyBeanie, have brought to you another review of an excellent set ( as the title states ) , the Hulk Buster Smash! <em>read on!</em></p>

<p>where to begin on the parts? this set has lots of new dark red, and i mean <em>lots</em>. there are quite a bit of dark red slopes, which make up the bodywork of the Hulkbuster, two dark red CCBS shells which only appear in CHI Worriz and this set. the helmet/cockpit thing on top of the mech is also in dark red, which has a printed design ( yay! ) and the mold only appears in two other sets. lots of 2x2 slopes are included, and are on the legs, feet, chest, and on one of the hands. there&#39;s a decent amount of trans light blue, and represents the ets on Iron Man and his mech&#39;s hands and feet, the unibeam, the guns, and assorted places on the Hulkbuster. there also some lights on Hulk&#39;s containment thingy, and the Scarlet Witch&#39;s powers are in trans light blue too. on this point, i agree with the rest of y&#39;all, i think the energy should be in trans red. if you like gold parts, there&#39;s lots of that too! on one of the hands, legs, torso, and guns.there&#39;s a bit of light bley, used in the containment thingy which uses stickers for the deatils. on the CT ( Containment Thingy ) there&#39;s a tall, clear stick to represent the Scarlet Witch floating above the Hulk.</p>

<p>the Hulk! he is so cool, even better than i expected! he is the perfect height, and his skin tone is actually slightly bluer than on the box. i thought i would like the Hulk from 2012 better, but this one is great!</p>

<p>Iron Man has to be included in any set with the Hulkbuster, and he has! this is my first Iron Man minifig, and also my first Hulk, Ultron, Scarlet Witch and Marvel set! the box and comic says he&#39;s the MK43, and he appears in two other sets, one which i plan to buy! soon Iron Man will have a twin! Tony Stark&#39;s head goes way back to 2012, so he needs an update. but he still looks good.</p>

<p>the Scarlet Witch is cool too. she wears a dark red jacket and a black skirt, with no dual molded legs. sorry guys. Wanda ( that&#39;s the Scarlet Witch&#39;s name ) has a wig that seems to be in all of the superhero sets with girls in Reddish Brown.</p>

<p>Ultron Prime is so rad! he is absolutely swimming in detail. and he&#39;s Titanium Metallic! there are some trans red pieces to represent his repulsors, like Iron Man.</p>

<p>oh yeah. and there&#39;s a Super Jumper. i can&#39;t get anyone on it higher than eight inches for some reason. to qoute Lord Business: and that&#39;s super frustrating!</p>

<p>the Playability is so high! me and my sisters played with it for about an hour, before and after breakfast! nice!</p>
