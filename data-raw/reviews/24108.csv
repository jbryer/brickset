<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box size is fairly wide not really a thick box and on the front box art it displays the Quinjet with Captain America riding his motorcycle and a research van with the title cho research also displaying Ultron,vision and Iron Man. Flipping over to the back it shows the sets play features hanging from a rope dropping Captain America out of the Quinjet is fun too exploding the van and flapping wings and opening things</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set that are useful are mostly the dark blue parts, the trans blue windscreen too the rest is pretty bland with grey black and white being common colors</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Defiantly the main draw for this set Captain America, is exclusive to this set and sports a dark blue Suit is face is tan and on a dark blue head his&nbsp;accessories are&nbsp;a black motorcycle and the iconic Captain America shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vision is an amazing figure and also is exclusive to this set too&nbsp;he has a Sand green and dark purple colour scheme he has a yellowish gold cape that&#39;s of the new style of cape that feels more like fabric and less like cardstock</p>

<p>Black widow is an awesome figure she sports a black suit and carries 2 ADU pistols her new hair piece is great and i would love to see it in more colours she has 2 faces 1 angry and one smiling</p>

<p>Ultimate Ultron&nbsp;exclusive to this set obviously the best version looks fantastic and i love how the helmet and neckpiece join to form his jagged mouth and his eyes</p>

<p>Ironman mk43 this one comes in most of the aou sets he has a double sided face and is gold and Dark Red his face plate can be pulled up</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build process is pretty straight forward and easy to follow with a few building techniques to learn from like clipping the white wedges to the clips</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Quinjet is really nice and what i originally did was think Moc Fodder but its gonna stay built for a long while the colour scheme is white and Dark Blue and makes up most of the set it is quite substantial and has some interesting play features like unwinding the rope that a figures holding onto and dropping the motorcycle out of the quinjet theres a retractable stud shooter at the bottom too the side wings can flap up and down and the back hatch can be pulled up to reveal a wrench and a fire hydrant&nbsp;a figure can fit in there too and also in the cockpit which has a stickered on dash</p>

<p>The research van this vehicle has a play feature that lets you blow up the vehicle and release vision from containment also a flap of the roof comes up to let ultron stand on it and you can use the superjumper to knock him off</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I really liked this set and appreciate the size of the quinjet and the minifigures 3 exclusive defiantly would reccomend this set to a hardcore collector or marvel fan not an average fan though</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-03-19T12:25:45.287Z","One Outstanding Aircraft!","<p>Hello, Bricksetters! I&#39;m PicnicBasketSam, and today I&#39;ll be reviewing the largest Avengers Age of Ultron set for you. I got this set at Target the other night with some birthday money and I figured that I would start collecting my LEGO Avengers with the biggest one.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is not very deep or tall, but very wide. Too wide, in fact--the box was only about two-thirds full when I opened it and when the parts are just dumped in out of bags, they take up very little space in this box. The instructions are BIG... they really did need to be packed in cardboard, because they were folded in half. Unacceptable in such a huge box. There&#39;s also a big sticker sheet and a comic book even less coherent than usual.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a handful of interesting parts here... aside from the exclusive parts in Vision and Ultron, we also a get a big trans-blue windshield, 1x4 slopes in white, and ETA-2 wing panels in dark blue. Other parts of note are a new-style motorcycle, a long rope with studs, and all those lovely dark blue curvy bits. The Super Jumper is a part, so I&#39;ll cover it here: It jumps relatively well, but the ridges behind the studs scar the back of minifig legs when you manage to lever them off. I just put studs on it and then the figure. And I said that it jumps... but it&#39;s well-nigh-impossible to aim, even occasionally launching just the figure off wildly.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are five minifigures in this set. Iron Man Mk43 is mainly dark red with detailed printing and a very nice gold faceplate. He appears in Avengers Tower and the Hulkbuster. Captain America looks alright, and I like the shield, but his legs are unprinted and... Ultron has the PERFECT cowl part for him and yet he doesn&#39;t use it, instead reverting to the same old printed head. He appears in the Hydra Fortress. Black Widow has an all-new hairpiece that works much better than the old one. She actually resembles her character here, unlike the last Quinjet. She can also be found in the Helicarrier. Vision is completely exclusive, and is mainly sand green with magenta head and hands and a yellow cloth cape. Side note... I love this new cape material! It actually FEELS like a cape as opposed to the old papery stuff. Ultimate Ultron&#39;s torso and legs are exclusive, however, his head is a combination of parts from three other sets. Nonetheless, he looks totally boss.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build goes fairly quickly with numbered bags. I completed it in about 1.5 hours. There was a point when the mechanism for the main play feature just flops around inside, which I really didn&#39;t like. Minifigs and the motorcycle are randomly interspersed throughout the bags.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Holy cow. This thing is a beast. Not only is it huge and awesome-looking, it&#39;s also packed full of play features. Let&#39;s start with the truck, shall we?</p>

<p>The truck has 2: Part of the roof flips up and a minifigure is mounted on top. You use the Super Jumper to knock it down. This only works about 1 in 10 times. FAIL.<br />
If you press a little button on the back of the truck, the doors blow off. This works very well, although contrary to the back of the box, Vision&#39;s pod stays put. PASS.</p>

<p>The Quinjet has quite a few. You can open up the top, the rear harch, and the cockpit. Pressing a button on top opens the bottom and drops a motorcycle. Pressing another button drops a minifigure out of one of the wings. The wings fold up for landing mode. And stud-shooters fold out of the other wing. All four stud shooters shoot just fine.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set. It&#39;s big, it looks awesome, it&#39;s really playable, it has exclusive minifigures, and the parts are quite good. One thing though... I wish that it was $70 instead of $80. Other than that, I would highly recommend this to Marvel fans and aircraft fans alike.</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2015-09-14T19:16:19.08Z","Something Just Feels.... Off","<p>I was (And still am!) a huge fan of the original Quinjet from 2012. It captured the source material perfectly and combined a good interior, exterior, play features and plenty of cool&nbsp;details. So when I saw they were making another Quinjet, I was very excited.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>These are both quite standard for a set of this size.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are not any particularly exciting parts, but the windscreen for the cockpit is quite rare, as is the new racing bike piece in black.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are a very appealing part of this set, mainly because this is the only (non-Helicarrier) way to get Black Widow, and Ultimate Ultron and Vision are both completely exclusive to this set. You also get an Iron Man Mk43 and a Captain America. These are all great figs, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Vision. He stole the show in Age of Ultron, created by Tony Stark as a sort of &quot;Anti-Ultron&quot; and his minifigure does not disappoint. It is incredibly detailed, and, like all the other figs, it is very movie accurate. The other exclusive, Ultimate Ultron, is equally impressive, and the other three figs are great as well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is good, and is particularly satisfying when the shape of the jet starts taking shape. There are some cool techniques too, especially when mounting the frontmost part of the wings.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I have said more or less completely positive things about this set all the way through, but as you may have noticed in my review title, there&#39;s just something about the look of this&nbsp;set that doesn&#39;t feel right. I think it is the combination of the awkward wheels (these were kept inside the jet until landing in the film) and the extensive use of fins across the jet, which make it look more like an alien spacecraft than a high-speed jet. Or maybe it&#39;s just that my expectations were so high due to the brilliance of the first Quinjet, but it just doesn&#39;t feel great to me.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As I have said before, this is a great set, but it just looks a bit awkward and I can&#39;t quite put a finger on exactly why. The figs are excellent and it is a good build. If you want it, then by all means go for it, and hopefully you won&#39;t mind whatever it is that&#39;s annoying me.</p>

"Echolord","2016-05-08T20:10:56.903Z","Behold, the Vision. ","<p>Once I started collecting AVENGERS sets, I knew I had to get Cap, Black Widow and Vision somehow. This was before the announcement of the Civil War lineup of sets. I got this set for two big reasons: Vision, and the Quinjet itself.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the expected size for an $80 set, with great graphics, as always with MARVEL sets. The instructions come in a plastic cover, with cardboard, and consist of two booklets. The Pieces come in 6 numbered bags.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Ultimate Ultron: This is honestly the only minifigure I did not want, considering that this version of Ultron doesn&#39;t do all that much in the movie, though that may just be me. The minifigure is printed vey well, on silver metallic torso, arms, and legs. The hips and hands are light stone grey. The printing shows some chrome, black, and orange, representing his armor, wiring, and operating lights. If looked at closely, the front of the torso seems to show some battle damage, with some of the vibranium plating damaged. The head is translucent orange, with some bubble-like printing on the cheeks. There is no face printed on this minifigure, the helmet and neck parts make his face, and honestly, it looks decent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vision: Currently exclusive to this set, Vision&#39;s movie appearance is captured perfectly in LEGO form. The use of pink hands, and the head are perfect, truly representing his &quot;skin?&quot; tone. His torso, arms, legs and hips are sand green, which looks spectacular. The printing on the torso depicts his armor, the top of his cape, and some grey lines, which outline his body. HIs legs have the continuation of his torso print, with more pink visible here, especially on the toes. His cape is exclusive, made out of a flexible, thin, soft material, and in a pale, golden yellow color, which looks really accurate. The head is printed with some sand green to show the metal wrapping around his head, and some dark purple eyes with white pupils. The Mind Stone in his forehead is printed blue, instead of yellow, which is the only deviation from the movie character on this minifig. His back show some simple lines, &nbsp;with some pink on the sides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Black Widow: This minifigure is very accurate to the movie. Her new molded hairpiece is amazing, and looks great. The hair style is much shorter than her original appearance, and curls up around the edges. Her face has been updated from her original minifigure, and it looks a lot better. The new torso is a much updated suit, meant to represent what she is wearing during AGE of ULTRON. The blue piping is well done, and almost seems to glow, compared to the black. Thin silver lines follow the shape of her jumpsuit, front and back. Her belt has some red and dark grey, and is continued onto the back as always. Her right leg has another belt printed. She come with two alien conquest guns, that I feel should be weaned out of the superheroes theme. They are good pieces, but not for this theme. This minifigure is printed with the same great quality as every other minifigure in this wave, and looks great in any collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Captain America: This minifigure is pretty good. The torso design is great, with perfect detailing, on thr front and the back. The straps for his shield are continued perfectly, and lined up very well. His legs are plain, which is a bit of a disappointment, but is still okay. His head is dark blue, and has the face printed on. Sadly, and understandably, his face suffers, as to be expected, from a tanning effect, as light nougat is printed onto a darker color. Even then, the printing is great, and has amazing detail, on both sides of the head. I do not agree with the new shield, and wish that the dark red shield would return, with silver replacing the white.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Iron Man MK 43: This minifigure is good. The detail quality on every part is amazing. What I am disappointed in is the fact that this minifigure shows up in three separate sets in this wave. Maybe an updated Tony Stark Minifigure should have been released in the Avengers tower, instead of this same one, which shows up here, and in the Hulkbuster, where it is needed. In the Avengers Tower scene, he isn&#39;t even wearing his suit! just the gloves! If that minifigure had been released, then I would be happy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is split into six bags. Bag 1 is the truck, Ultron, and Vision. The truck uses very simple building techniques, and is a very quick build. It only uses two stickers. Bag two is the bottom of the jet, and Black Widow. One sticker is used here. Some techniques that are new to me are used here, specifically with the payload bay, which drops Cap&#39;s motorcycle. Bag three is the right side, Cap, and the motorcycle. The motor cycle utilizes two new body&nbsp;pieces, and looks a&nbsp;lot better than the old ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;This bag uses two stickers. Bag 4 is the left wing, and also uses two stickers. Practically, aside from some small details, the wings are the same. Bag 5 finishes the wings, and the hull of the jet, using 5 &nbsp;stickers. Bag 6 is the cockpit and Iron Man, and uses two stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed set looks great. A total of four minifigs can be fit inside the quinjet, one in the cockpit, one on a motorcycle in the payload bay, and two in the read troop hold, where there is space for Black Widow&#39;s guns, along side a fire extinguisher and a wrench. The model makes great use of hinges, and allows for some really neat positioning of the wings and flaps. On the right side of the jet, there is a little space for a minifigure to be held on the bottom, with a rope and two studs. A button disguised as the Avengers A releases the minifigure, to retrieve the Vision. The other side has a poseable&nbsp;stud shooter turret, and can be removed easily. &nbsp;A total of 4 stud shooters are used in the model, two on top, and two on the turret. The truck explodes when a small .5x2 space is pressed down, and sends the top and sides flying, and Visions case available to be stolen.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is well worth the $80, for Vision and Ultimate Ultron combined, plus an awesome Quinjet, that is much better than the Civil War version.&nbsp;</p>
