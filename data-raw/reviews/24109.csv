<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Box for this set is quite big and the artwork shows the set in action.The set shows the minifigs included with the age of ultron logo while the box shows all the feature this set included. This set included two instruction booklets,five numbered bags and a small comic book is included.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Five minifigures are included in this set. The first one that we are going to look at is iron man</p>

<p><strong>Iron man mark 43:</strong> This figure is in two other sets which are <strong>76031 The hulk buster smash and 76032 The</strong> <strong>avengers quinjet city jet.</strong>This guy has the iconic red and gold color scheme which the gold shines really well giving this guy a metal feel. This has great detail like any other iron man figure. The face plate flips up and shows Tony&#39;s head which has and happy and an angry expression. Both the torso and legs are new for this figure and some hair is also included molded in black.</p>

<p><strong>Thor:</strong> This guy is a meh to me, he looks very similar to the original thor from 2012&nbsp; which is not Lego fault but there is no leg printing on this guy which is a disappointing although the torso printing is really good. His head shows his beard and features a happy expression and a more aggressive expression. This guy is also in 76030 Avengers hydra showdown. In my opinion this is the weakest minifigure in this set</p>

<p><strong>Ultron mark 1</strong>: This guy is awesome and I might say one of the best mini-figs of this year I&#39;ll get onto while now! For starters the detail is amazing I&#39;m surprised how much there is. This guy is meant to be a damaged iron legion drone which this guy gives perfectly but there is one slight problem the head has used a clear head not a new mold. This might be because of lego doing budget cuts but it could get really annoying to some people and when you put it next to a iron legion drone you&#39;ll see why but I have to admit it gives it a some what menacing look to him. This guy is the best minifigure out of this set for sure! He is also exclusive to this set.</p>

<p><strong>Iron legion: </strong>The two iron legion are identical and the color scheme is really nice with a white and blue scheme. These guys are basically iron man but with a different lick of paint which is good since it is accurate to the film. When you lift the face plate you&#39;ll find the same head used for ultimate ultron which I guess Lego didn&#39;t know what to give these guys I suppose? Anyways these guys are great figs which are also exclusive to this set.</p>

<h3>Play-features</h3>

<p>This set play features isn&#39;t mind blowing to this set it isn&#39;t like something a kid will want to buy it for this set. First of the iron legion deck comes out and the door swings right down to access the iron legions. Secondly the room holding the Loki scepter has a screen showing the scepter which swings to the right. Meanwhile in the ultron building room there is two laser things and a circle to stand ultron which swings around 360 degrees. Building ultron is really fun and I had fun playing with it something which kids would enjoy to. Another feature is when the widows fall down which like the building room is also fun. Into the computer room the computer swings side to side and features a hidden gun behind the left side of the computer I assume this is a gun for Black Widow. Onto the balcony the sofa raises up to show a another hidden gun while the balcony raises up to show two stud shooters which can open fire while on the roof there is this cave like thing which has two stud shooters and turns around. In addition to that the cave thing opens up to show a drone with two stud shooters.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model is great with great playability there is a good amount of room for kids&nbsp; to move there minifigures around. The different rooms are great with great fun to play around. For the set for this size it made my mum and step-dad to say&quot;that&#39;s it&quot; The flying drone is really fun to chase down minifigures with. What I don&#39;t get is the cave thing which is not seen in the film although this more a playability feature. You get two cups which is very good and a syringe piece for the medic room. There is A LOT of stickers in this set I counted about 12 stickers but what is really annoying though is the stickers for the avenger logo. The thing I find annoying about them is that there is four different stickers for the logo and it is really annoying to align them correctly. Also included is a super-jumper which damage your minifigs legs if you use them and the aim is to make the balcony move to the side and cause the minifigures but because of the way they build it It will only move it to the side by a tad.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is good for display and for kids to play while the minifigures are also very good but needed a another figure or should of included black-widow or Bruce banner. The model is very accurate to the film but the features are a bit lack-luster. This set is good for a display piece and for kids to play with it. But for &pound;59.99 you&#39;ll expect more. I highly recommend to get this set on sale on amazon I got mine for &pound;48.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>fun and easy build</p>

<p>Great for display and for play</p>

<p>Minifigs are good</p>

<p>Building ultron is quite fun</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>Perhaps a another minifigure such as Bruce banner or black widow</p>

<p>too many stickers</p>

<p>Lack-luster features</p>

<p>Not the best value</p>

<p>So that&#39;s it. I hope you enjoyed this review and have a great day!</p>

"coyboy1","2015-12-25T11:56:37.377Z","Lots of windows!","<p>I recently received this set as a Christmas gift to add to my Marvel collection. I visited the home of a friend, who is also an AFOL, who had this set prominently displayed with their other Lego collectibles and upon viewing it I was hoping to own one of my own soon.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty big. Shows great detail regarding what is included with the set. Two very large instruction books, a sticker sheet, and a comic come with this set. You feel that once you place the instructions in your hand, you&#39;re holding onto something that is bound to be a very large and intricate build but actually it&#39;s not. The instructions are very easy to understand and read.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Windows, windows, and more windows. If you&#39;re sole purpose of buying this set is to attain windows, well you&#39;re in luck. Aside from that you also get a very nice 2 drawer dresser/desk. A lot of thin 1 stud rounds, used mainly for the small guns that are placed around the tower. There&#39;s not a lot more that can be said regarding any specialty pieces here that stands out. If you&#39;ve built the Daily Bugle set, you start to feel as if this is a take on that set slightly.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Another review I read on here was disappointed in the Thor minifig and I couldn&#39;t agree more. You get an MK 43 Iron Man which should be expected considering it&#39;s his tower. The Ultron is exclusive and I enjoyed how well it was depicted to fit with the movie scene. The Iron Legion minifigs are also nice in detail and I like the Trans red heads.</p>

<p>Regarding the Thor and Iron Man. If you&#39;ve collected the Marvel sets like I have, I have enough Thors and Iron Mans. I don&#39;t mind getting an Iron Man for this set but Thor could&#39;ve been replaced with a better fitting minifig.</p>

<p>The scene in the film contains every Avenger character and then some. Most notably, Stan Lee is in this scene. Why not use this set to finally have a Stan Lee minifig. That in itself would merit the cost and value involved with the price.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Seeing that this build is mainly windows, it comes together almost too easily. There are 4 bags of parts and once you open them up you realize there&#39;s not much to them at all. You almost feel as if this could&#39;ve been a smaller set but isn&#39;t represented that way. Each chunk of the window side of the tower is repetitive, I almost didn&#39;t need instructions to guess what was coming next. The size of the individual rooms is fair but a little tight when using some of the accessories placed in them, particularly near the bottom rooms. Getting closer to the top, it feels more open. The rooftop is probably the most detailed section having hidden compartments for weapons and a glider. I also really did like the platform balcony area that folds up exposing more hidden weapons. Get ready to have fun lining up stickers. The Avengers logo was a bit tricky and the small Iron Legion stickers on the lower windows could&#39;ve been explained better since those windows flip up and display the stickers a certain way.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model does look and display very nicely. I like how it can hinge to open and display the guts of the tower then hinge and close to give you something that goes well with any Marvel collection. It doesn&#39;t feel as big as you would expect it to be, but it does come with a few nice features that add to the playability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I can&#39;t complain too badly about the value of this set since it was a gift. In fact, I really can&#39;t complain by any means being a gift but to give anyone interested in this set an honest opinion, it&#39;s not really worth the retail price. If you can find it cheaper elsewhere, get it. This set feels as if Lego couldn&#39;t get something as big as they wanted to give you without bumping the price up even more so they made a huge display box to house 4 adequate sized parts bags and 2 oversized instruction manuals. Both manuals could&#39;ve been reduced in size which would&#39;ve shrunken down the price and box size quickly.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T15:21:54.087Z","Impressive Playset","<p><strong>Set #76038 Attack on Avengers Tower:</strong> This is one of the best sets made by LEGO Marvel in some time, not only does it feature an actual building for a change as opposed to numerous vehicles and set pieces for action scenes, but it stands out as one of the best offerings from the Age of Ultron sub-theme as well simply because it gives the Avengers a sweet looking base to call their own when not out saving the world.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: It&rsquo;s a big box, showing off the set in great detail, with a fun action shot on the front and all the play features as well as good interior shots of the model on the back. Once again you also get to see the NEW Super Jumper in action, a piece that seems to have been largely forgotten now that we&rsquo;ve moved into 2016.</p>

<p>Instructions: There are two very large numbered manuals in this set without cardboard protection. It separates the build evenly between the two manuals, and due to the large size of both of them it is very easy to follow along with them. You&rsquo;ll find the usual cross-promotional images at the back of the second manual.</p>

<p>The included comic is the same as all the other Age of Ultron sets, nothing else really to say.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set is loaded with windows, windows of all types that some will have stickers applied. However they aren&rsquo;t printed on so they&rsquo;re clear and great for MOCing enthusiasts. Other than that nothing jumps out at me as rare or unique, possible exception includes the window frames used with the two bars in the middle to resemble separate panes for the window.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Iron Legion: Using Iron Man&rsquo;s parts this Minifigure is a very fun looking one and just as impressive. The Iron Legion were used as additional defensive measures and troop fodder for the Avengers, probably because of Tony.</p>

<p>The printing is identical between both figures included in the set, they have dual sided torso with extensive detailing for the armour and systems, they also include some marking with the Avengers logo indicating who they represent. The head is a clear orange one with very minimal looking printing, unless those are bubbles formed in the plastic creation, though I doubt it as both faces feature the little bubble effects in the exact same places.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also leg printing and nice looking variants of IM&rsquo;s helmet in a dark blue colour with gold printing on the face.</p>

<p>Iron Man MK 43: The same variant found in the Hulk Buster set, there&rsquo;s nothing new to report on accessories and printing here for this fellow. Iron Man is always a treat though, the parts and printing choices always impress.</p>

<p>Thor: Identical to the version found in the 25$ set, Thor doesn&rsquo;t offer any new printing or accessories. I still dig the newer material cape he&rsquo;s sporting now though.</p>

<p>Ultron MK I: This is Ultron&rsquo;s early days, when he was made up from Iron Legion parts, as evidenced by the one white arm with a blue hand, the printing on his torso referencing the Legion and of course his facial print. Which indicates a smashed helmet from one of the Legion on the front and back showing the glowing essence of Ultron from within.</p>

<p>Ultron MK 1 is a great looking figure with awesome printing detail work. The highlight for me of the entire set.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: Start on the first floor of the tower, you&rsquo;ll build two sections, one with a sensor room that I believe doubles as a medical facility for Tony, the other half of the floor is where the Iron Legion rest until called upon. I can&rsquo;t emphasize this enough, build this on a flat surface, not on a carpeted floor or a bed or anything else, this build isn&rsquo;t extremely fragile or difficult, however it benefits greatly from having a flat surface to work on that won&rsquo;t jostle or move because of the fact that you&rsquo;re building up four levels of a tower complex that is essentially a large playset, and because it is designed to open up on hinges each half of the model will be more and more top heavy as you go along.</p>

<p>Bag 2: The next level is where you get to build up the room where Tony and Bruce study the scepter and the construction facility for Ultron who builds himself in this set. You will be focusing on one side at a time as you&rsquo;re building, so all of the steps are for one half of each section of the tower and doesn&rsquo;t involve any troublesome parts, aside from potential sticker alignment when building.</p>

<p>Bag 3: We&rsquo;re in the halfway point here, with the penthouse party room being built here, which includes the first section of the balcony that is a part of the penthouse. You work on each side one after the other and won&rsquo;t find too many difficult areas. I have to say compared to the Malibu Mansion set this one has been very satisfying so far, it is a completely enclosed building once finished and is loaded with play features.</p>

<p>Bag 4: This completes the tower, by adding a defense platform, the extension to the penthouse balcony and that&rsquo;s about it. You may need a bit of help here as the balcony gimmick has to be aligned properly. There is also a load of stickers, the sides of the tower will be decorated with the Avengers logo and it is good to get help for aligning everything right so the stickers look good. Not much else to say here, on to the final model.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Avengers Tower is, in my opinion, the best offering Marvel Super Heroes has given us to date that is basically a playset. While not to scale it has a lot of personality and serves as a great display piece along with a fun play set for younger builders.</p>

<p>The tower model is fully enclosed and features three floors with a fourth level tower defense item on top. There&rsquo;s a balcony that sticks out on the upper floor to accommodate Minifigures and a host of fun details.</p>

<p>The First Floor features a medical bay for Minifigures and houses two Iron Legion drones behind sliding windows. Push them forward and fold the windows down and the Iron Legion can leap out to attack the Avengers after Ultron takes over.</p>

<p>The Second Floor includes a construction area for Ultron Mk. 1 and an examination room for Loki&rsquo;s scepter, which is resting on a lab table with computer monitoring equipment nearby. Ultron&rsquo;s construction room has blast away windows, pull two Technic pieces forward and the mechanism will push the windows out so Ultron can escape to attack the upper floor.</p>

<p>The Third Floor is a small lounge area with an open window out onto a nice looking balcony and a computer station area for monitoring stuff, I&rsquo;m not clear exactly what the stickers are meant to be monitoring exactly, possibly Jarvis, but it&rsquo;s definitely impressive.</p>

<p>Pop open the upper tower with the stud launchers to reveal a small winged attack drone that can help fight off Ultron and his re-programmed Iron Legion drones. This tower can rotate to face any direction.</p>

<p>The balcony can rotate to throw anyone standing on them off and two stud launchers are hidden underneath for more defense. Overall this model is very impressive, while there is a large reliance on stickers, the set in general is just impressively detailed and full of fun and charm. As I said, the best building/playset Marvel Super Heroes has given us.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I strongly recommend this set. I love the level of detail represented here and the fact that this makes a great central display piece for any Marvel Super Hero based set. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with this one if you can still find it, pick it up.</p>

"Fauch","2016-09-06T21:36:15.517Z","Good sets with too many stickers","<p>Parts</p>

<p>You mostly get pieces in light and dark blueish grey as well as transparent light blue which are amongst the most common colors, at least in my collection. It includes many windows, though some city sets may provide you with a lot too and be better value for money.</p>

<p>What stands out most to me is the relatively large number of big rounded panel, including a 3x6x6 which is a mold I had never seen before.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I think the minifigs are outstanding, this is&nbsp;one of my best set for minifigs. I would say Thor is weakest just because he has no legs printing.</p>

<p>The minifigs are very detailed and lego doesn&#39;t do much better than that at the moment.&nbsp;Aside&nbsp;from side printing, there&#39;s not much that could be improved.</p>

<p>Legs and torsos printings lined-up near perfectly on each fig.</p>

<p>the iron patriots use the ultimate ultron head, that is to say a trans neon orange head with some colored dot around the mouth place.</p>

<p>Nice metallized body parts for Ultron and Thor. In particular, Thor looks much better than I expected (He is still the weakest, but I never said bad, it&#39;s just that the other figs are great and he is just good)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple and straightforward. There are many mini-builds such as computers and pieces of furnitures which add some nice variety.</p>

<p>The most difficult part is probably aligning a bunch of stickers to form the avenger logo near the top of the tower. Moreover the stickers are clear and to be applied on clear parts, so you better not get dust or air bubble stuck under them. You will miss a lot of the details if you choose to not apply them. For KFOL, it is probably better to let an adult apply them.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This set is loaded. You can blow up windows, split up the balcony, deploy iron patriots and a drone with stud shooters. It has turrets, computers to use, hidden weapons and you can build ultron with mechanical arms. The designers really put all that could possibly fit in the set, there is no wasted space.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is pretty big for a lego tower, with its antenna it&#39;s taller than most towers I have but it&#39;s also larger.</p>

<p>One of the best things with this model&nbsp;is that it hinges open, so that you have a closed building and not just a facade. Also, with all the windows you get a good view of the details inside, and there is a lot of them.</p>

<p>It has some interesting shapes. In particular I don&#39;t see rounded buildings too often.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>With a nice size, lots of play features and good detailing inside, I feel it is better value than what the price per piece would have you think, though not a great deal either. The colors are a bit bland though, I wonder what it would look like in transparent fluorescent blue.</p>

"dedenbach2011","2016-10-17T15:56:38.82Z","great to play, or display","<p>This set gets a lot of critical review for different reasons, but my son and I absolutely love this tower.&nbsp; Some people are bummed by the size, some by the amount of stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Awesomeness</em></strong>: The tower just looks cool.&nbsp; It opens up and has 6 different, little rooms with nice play features (hidden weapons, a place to repair ironmans...).&nbsp; It is not an extremely large set like a ghostbusters HQ or anything, so for the price I think they really nailed the avengers tower.&nbsp; It looks great on display but this is one of the sets my son plays with the most, and we have a lot of superhero sets.&nbsp; You also get Loki&#39;s staff to analzye, which means you are getting an infinity stone!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Minifigs:</em></strong> Such a great selection.&nbsp; You get an updated Ironman with great detail (you can never have enough Ironmans), a regular ol&#39; Thor, two Iron Legion guys (whoo hoo!), and Ultron MK1.&nbsp; The iron legion and ultron guys are great looking and exclusive to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Well... </strong></em>we love this set and I totally want to get another one.&nbsp; If you are super slick with your bricks you could totally add on to this tower and make it bigger.&nbsp; great little details in the rooms, cool play features, and solid minfigs.&nbsp; It would be cool to get something newish with Thor.&nbsp; I know he doesn&#39;t wear his helmet in the movie but a Thor with a helmet would be cool.&nbsp; great set.</p>

"friggityfrag7","2021-05-15T02:06:58.847Z","Great Set, but Overshadowed by its Successor","<p>This set features the Avengers Tower during the first half of Avengers: Age of Ultron when the Avengers first meet Ultron. The set features 5 Minifgs, a Drone, and a 4-story tower build. The set&#39;s MSRP is 59.99 but nowadays in 2021 you will rarely find a sealed copy under $100, used copies are a bit better with prices ranging from $70-$90</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures</p>

<p>Iron Man- This one is the Mark 43 armor and has a very detailed Torso. Not much to complain about here, a worthy addition to those looking to expanded their Iron Man armor Collection</p>

<p>Thor- This version of Thor features him in his armor and comes with a cape and Mjolnir, it does leave a bit to be desired as the hair is the incorrect color and there is no leg printing but a good to start to customize it</p>

<p>Ultron Mk- Probably the highlight of the selection is Ultron in his first form, the transparent head, different coloured arms and highly detailed printing captures his look very well</p>

<p>Iron Legion- Another highly desirable figure, there are two of them within the set. It has a transparent neon orange head with light printing resembling bubbles. Also, very nice and relatively easy to Army Build as it was common to buy multiples of the set to expand the tower, at least back in 2015</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>The Tower Folds in half to create a Dollhouse Style interior</p>

<p>1rst Floor-This features Windows that fold down to deploy the Iron Legion that is being held here, Interestingly there slots for 4 figures so one could easily purchase two more of the figs to put there or even just regular Iron Man suits. The other Features a medical bay with a bed, IV drip, drawers, a syringe and a Stickered panel monitoring vitals</p>

<p>2nd Floor- In one half is an area with robot arms to repair the Mark 43 or create Ultron, the figures stands on a turntable, so it can turn around a break-out the windows which can be done by using the light fixtures on the exterior. The other side holds Loki&#39;s sceptor whihc is under analysis and also features stickers</p>

<p>3rd Floor-This one is the Terrace which holds some sets, so one could recreate the party scene from the movie. The couch is on a hinge, so it can fold up and reveal a hidden gun. It also has various glasses for the figs to hold. The balcony also splits to reveal two blasters to fend off Ultron and the Iron Legion. The other also many stickers to represent a computer, the back has another place to hide a gun, but I&#39;m unsure how minifigs are supposed to reach it.</p>

<p>Roof-The very top has a fold out defense turret and&nbsp; opens up to launch an armed drone as well. the structure can also rotate and has an antennae</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>There is a nice variety of parts with many accessories, transparent pieces and windows. The sticker sheet itself is useful as its mostly for technology so it&#39;s very useful for someone building an MCU Moc, especially if it involves Tony.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Thoughts</p>

<p>Overall this set has a very nice build and some amazing minifugures as well. It could easily be expanded as well if you bought multiple copies...in 2015. It is not practical to do that as the set rose in value since it&#39;s retirement. The new 76166 Avengers Tower is a vastly better successor with additional floors, minifigs and can be found for as much and in some cases, less money than it&#39;s predecessor due to still being in production. That is not to say that this set is bad, it is actually excellent, but unless you want the figures, especially the Mark 43 and Iron Legion. You are better off buying the newer one. If you do find this set for under $70 though, I would definitely recommend picking it up, if not solely for its parts.</p>
