"Szu","2015-02-08T23:58:37.77Z","The King of Series 13","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>General-issue minifig bag. Nothing unusual here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Crown-hair part! Nicely painted, well designed in shape. Hairstyle well matched with the beard coming as a separate part as well.<br />
The figure comes with royal mantle, which is made of two separate parts of clothing: the sable fur - coloured collar, and the red mantle itself. The unique combination looks great, if you&#39;re asking me.<br />
The sword the figure comes with is a long, nice weapon, well fitted to become royal arms. One might dispute the idea behind it being golden (especially that it is matte).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Almost standard for a minifig. The mantle requires some skill and attention, my 10 year old nephew managed to mis-arrange it the first time.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Brilliant. The figure looks as good as it appears in the promotional pictures.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Playability / usefullness of the king is unquestionable. Think re-enacting battles, complementing castle- and in fact any medieval theme- sets or composing custom Lego-chess.</p>

<h3>Pros / Cons</h3>

<p>+ overall looks<br />
+ useful (!!)<br />
+ design of the mantle and the crown part<br />
+ painting<br />
+ face expression just correct for the king<br />
<br />
- the thing I am missing is the sceptre, or a part fitting for ornamental g<span dir=""auto"">lobus cruciger role</span> maybe? Why keep one royal hand empty? Well?<br />
- the sword must not necessarily have been golden matte.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Go get it. That&#39;s the king of the Series ;-)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some very nice ones. Notable is the Fisherman/Lawn Gnome/Santa beard in Reddish Brown (finally), the new crown/hair piece which seamlessly blends into the beard, and then the cape. The red piece is similar in style to the Nazgul/Witch-king cape, as it has three neck holes that fold onto each other, but it is smooth and free of holes. There is a separate cloth piece for the ermine trim, which folds the same way. The torso and legs are bright and colorful, and feel very LEGO-like with their primary colors, but have limited use. The pearl gold sword is not exclusive, but nice to have.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The cape&#39;s a bit difficult to fold properly and align, and to fit the head and beard over them, you must place the head into the beard before first putting them both onto the neck. Otherwise, it&#39;s simple.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I love it. He looks very regal and he is certainly the best King LEGO has made. Probably the biggest aid to this is the hair/crown, as he&#39;s not wearing a battle crown, and fits better in a royal court. His cape looks fantastic, and the way it projects backward gives it a larger, grander appearance. This King is certainly waiting for a palace in which to be entertained by the Princess, Jester, and Wizard of Series 12.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you like Castle or the figure, seek him out. He is well worth finding.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-06T21:23:57.89Z","A Classic of a King.","<p><strong>Set #71008 Classic King: </strong>This Minifigure is #1 from Series 13 and it&#39;s a rather interesting choice as we have yet to see this type of figure before now in the CMF Series. We&#39;ve had knights and princesses and many other medieval figures, this is the first King however.</p>

<p>Some have compared this minifigure to the Burger King, so I&#39;m just not going to bring it up. What I enjoy about this figure is that you have printed dual molded legs, with some great pantaloon detailing. His torso is single-sided for the print, the back is covered by his red cape and the impressive new fur overcape piece with the spotted print. He&#39;s using the new shorter beard with mustache in a nice brown colour and a great looking head piece with a gold crown and brown hair. For accessories he comes with a gold broadsword.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great and highly detailed looking minifigure with some great parts, the new over cape piece is really nice and I hope we&#39;ll see it more with many other Castle themed characters. Or more appropriately, Cruella DeVil in Disney Series 2. (Provided there is one.) Definitely recommend this one.</p>

"thechabear","2015-05-20T01:34:05.377Z","the king of the packs","<p>This is my third ever review and my first minifig review so let&#39;s get cracking.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>Just a normal blind bag with no instructions as such, simply the standard minifig pack.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is only 7 pieces and all of them are really good.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The king is a really nice figure and maybe the best in this series. The printing is really good even on the cape. This would be great with the knights theme since we only tend to get kings in expensive sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The best minifig in series 13 in my opinion. It would go well&nbsp;with the castle theme and now we have a princess from series 12 to go with him, so we just need a queen. He is the king of the series 13 packs, period!</p>

"SanMams91","2015-02-28T04:06:28.9Z","A cooler, nostalgic king","<p>Honestly, when I saw that this minifigure was coming out in 2015, I was sure I was going to try and find it. When I did, after feeling for it carefully, I was satisfied with what I got. Excellent detailing on the torso and legs, a great face print, crown hairpiece, and beard. There is one thing about this figure, which I&#39;m sure others will notice too, which is that the cake is a bit of a minor flaw. It just ends up looking a little &#39;floaty&#39;. Other than that, it&#39;s made up of two pieces! Great minifigure. Get him if you can.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-11T15:37:31.79Z","literal ROYALTY","<p>I am continuing my quest to review every single minifigure ever released, legit. Well, unless you&#39;re an anti-Series 13 fan, the thirteenth non-licensed series falls into that catergory. The first character incorporated into the set of 16 is the one and only, the royal, the kingly... Burger King himself. No, this is simply called the Classic King, although many fans, myself included, think this looks a heck of a lot like that Burger King mascot. This series had an official release date of January 2015, though the series did briefly pop up on Toys R Us&#39; website in December 2014. It retailed for 4 dollars, like the Simpsons Series and Series 12.</p>

<p>Okay, so let&#39;s get down to business. Obviously, as the title blatantly states, I think highly, royally, even, of this character, and part of that is due to his incredible new hair-hat combo that was made for this figure, and yeah, gosh it looks stunning! The curvature of the brown hair at the back is superb, as is th golden crown surrounding it. Something which I feel is underappreciated about this character is the head print, which has a chill expression that sports a brown gotye, and a thin moustache. His beard, while not being a new sculpt, was new in this red-brown colour, if I ain&#39;t mistaking. I&#39;ve always been impressed by the level of moulded detailing regarding that beard, and it seamlessly matches the hair mould. That beard is made entirely of rubber, which I guess is more prone to damage, but I&#39;ve never been triggered.</p>

<p>And since that above paragraph was too large, let&#39;s move onto a new segment, and discuss the bottom section of the character, starting with his capes. He comes with two, both of which use that classic harder material used up until around 2016. The shaping of that collar is made so that it curves around the torso pretty perfectly, and the bottom, red cape works well with it to establish a solid design and a fitting colour combo. There&#39;s some printing on the upper collar as well, which once again, looks superb.</p>

<p>My guy has some extensive torso detailing that I&#39;m honestly pretty darn impressed by. The colour combo of red, dark yellow, and blue combines for yet another royal colour combination that works excellently. He lacks back printing, but that beautiful cape more than makes up for it, as do his red arms. Gosh, his legs have insanely incredible detailing, including the yellow stripes! The blue is printed onto the side of his legs as well, which I, again, find impressive! Lastly, his accessory is a pearl gold sword, which is obviously a brilliant inclusion.</p>

<p>Overall, my gosh, what a brilliant minifigure! The new hair hat combo is brilliant, but the printed detailing surrounding this is royalty. 5 out of 5, and one of my favourite CMF&#39;s yet!</p>
