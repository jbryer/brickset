If found this Sheriff will lock-im-up.","<p><strong>Set #71008 Sheriff: </strong>Meet another classic Minifigure from the Old West, the Sheriff, who looks a bit similar to Sheriff Not-A-Robot, if he was a regular minifigure of course.</p>

<p>This wonderful looking Sheriff includes a nice, wide brimmed Cowboy hat, a great single-sided torso print with a detailed vest and a shirt under it, plus a nice gold pocket watch chain and his sheriff&#39;s star. He&#39;s got a great looking facial print also and some nice detail work on the pants with a side holster printed on one side. For accessories he includes the pistol piece, a brown version of the mustache and a printed tile showing a wanted poster with an image of the Bandit on it.</p>

<p>This is a great looking figure and you can&#39;t go wrong with these types of characters in my opinion. I&#39;d recommend tracking him down if you missed him upon initial release.</p>

<p>Okay, so atop the figure is that cowboy hat, and while it was not a new mould by a long shot, this sports exclusive printing regarding that gold star. It&#39;s nice seeing that sculpt in dark brown. The head piece has a useful expression which sports a frustrated face. No alternate expressions, but that&#39;s totally okay, since it&#39;d be exposed at the back. His moustache, which I initially thought was new for the figure, was not a new mould for the character, but rather, a new colour for the piece, that being red-brown. That mould is always great to get, so no complaints there.</p>

<p>The torso for this figure uses an old-fashioned aesthetic that certainly works, and the colour combo of tan and red-brown definitely does capture that. I particularly like the gold chain. Something I don&#39;t like about this is the lack of back printing, but at least the legs have good detail! That belt spans the entire front of the waist, while that holster, which is printed onto the front as well, carries onto the side of the leg.</p>

<p>As far as his accessories go, two are included, one being a pistol, which is obviously very fitting. The coolest accessory is that 2x2 tile that says WANTED and sports an image of a bandit. That&#39;s no ordinary bandit, rather, it&#39;s the Series 6 Bandit, released in 2012. This is a good reference.</p>

<p>Overall, I used to really dislike the Sheriff, but dang it, he&#39;s grown on me a lot! He doesn&#39;t use any new pieces or anything, but the pieces LEGO incorporated are used to their fullest, with exclusive, detailed prints and such. I&#39;m gonna give him a 4 out of 5 points!</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review, thanks for reading! Hope it was informative and enjoyable!</p>
