<p>Unicorn Girl has a very minimalistic print with a few stars on her front torso near the neckline, some printing on her toes for the hooves and that&#39;s pretty much it. Her facial expression is a cute one with a fun looking smile and some great freckles on her cheeks. She includes a new tail piece with a horse tail to attach on the legs and a large head piece sculpted in the guise of a horse, with a slot to attach a horn.</p>

<p>Overall this minifigure is a bit less impressive when it comes to the parts, for re-use purposes you are rather limited, however it is an awesome looking costumed minifig and only the second one to be a female character. Unicorn Girl looks great and will be definitely worth tracking down if you missed out on it the first time. Strongly recommended.</p>

<p>The unicorn girl is a good figure but feels as if it is missing an accessory .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>head attachment is quite nicely moulded and has some subtle prints , the horn is just the unikitty horn in white , the head showcases a happy expression , the torso is plain but doesn&#39;t require any more prints , the hip attachment is a very nice tail with lavender printing and the legs are simple but affective .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>&nbsp;The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good figure but feels like it is missing an accessory I don&#39;t know what but it just feels like it is missing one but I still recommend it .</p>

But I think all fans can agree that the Unicorn Girl, the third character in the set, is amongst the best. This set of 16 released back in 2015, where it had a retail price of 4 dollars.</p>

<p>Atop this minifigure is two connecting pieces: a horn, and a mask. The unicorn horn, which was new to the figure in white, pegs onto the top via a pole connection, and that horn is made from a rubber material. The mask piece looks splendid and adorable; I love the eyes. I will say that I wish the horn was coloured in perhaps a light purple to contrast the plain white, but I can dig it. This whole figure has a cute aesthetic, but that&#39;s mostly thanks to her adorable head piece, which has a small smile.</p>

<p>The torso has minimal printing, but I&#39;m not complaining. I appreciate the small multicoloured stars below the head, which add to the overall aesthetic. She doesn&#39;t have any back printing, however her amazing tail more than makes up for it. It was a brand-new mould made for this character that&#39;s&nbsp;entirely caste in white rubber. Purple printing is applied to the back, as are&nbsp;some moulded streaks.</p>

<p>She doesn&#39;t have any accessories, but she doesn&#39;t need one, considering two moulds were designed especially for her. She&#39;s adorable, fantastic, and a solid 5 out of 5 points, as well as one of my favourites in the series!</p>
