"8BrickMario","2015-01-20T18:55:21.21Z","Charming!","<p>One of the first Minifigures of the series to be seen, everyone gravitated toward the cobra piece. He&#39;s definitely worth more than the cobra alone.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Series 13 packaging is bright and eye-catching. The sheet inside displays a minifigure checklist for the series, and on the other side, the code for the MMO.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The turban is probably the best new part here. It has a far more detailed cloth wrapping texture than the previous, almost spherical, turban piece. This one isn&#39;t intended for ornamentation, as it has no pin hole to put feathers or &quot;hair accessories&quot; in. The cobra is a bit of a disappointment, as the thin tongue necessitated the piece to be cast in rubber. This makes it more flexible, and it won&#39;t break, but I don&#39;t like it. The 3L bar in dark orange is new and exclusive to him, but it&#39;s not too useful.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Snake Charmer looks great. His face has fuzzy-looking eyebrows, a nice moustache, and his mouth is open as if playing his&nbsp;<em>pungi</em>&nbsp;flute. His lime color is a nice representation of the colorful Indian clothes he wears, and he has a bead necklace and a medallion printed over his shirt. His legs extend the shirt&#39;s printing, and his pants are white. The flute piece is sort of lazy to me, since it lacks the bulb of the traditional pungi, and no matter how you turn his head and pose it in his hand, there&#39;s no good way to pose him like he&#39;s playing it. Despite its material, the cobra looks nice. It takes up two studs on a plate, and it has some nice markings on the front and back.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not at all difficult.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I do enjoy him quite a lot. He has the appropriate appearance of a snake charmer from India, and he has a nice design. He does give off a vibe of the Adventurers theme, but he&#39;s still nice to have around in the modern day settings, perhaps working in a carnival with the Fortune Teller.&nbsp;I would recommend seeking him out if you&#39;re interested, since he&#39;s a good Minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The snake charmer is my first series 13 minifigure, and the first I&#39;ve bought since the <em>Simpsons</em> series. It was an impulse purchase, picked at random, as&nbsp;I love getting the first fig in a series that way, as there is not yet any&nbsp;chance of duplicates.</p>

<p>I was pleased to find the snake charmer as he was one of the figures that stood out for me in the series. He has a brand new turban, which seems more casual than the original turban, which i believe originated with the <em>Harry Potter</em> line in 2001, and more in the same style as the <em>Prince of Persia</em> ones from 2010. Apart from the turban, the charmer has a nicely printed torso, which continues onto his printed legs. I&#39;m still not sure if I like printed coats etc.&nbsp;that extend to the legs, but this one works for me. If it doesn&#39;t work for you, you can just give him plain white legs instead.</p>

<p>The highlight of this &quot;set&quot; might be the cobra snake&nbsp;for many people. As I&#39;m not at all into <em>Ninjago</em>, this is my first snake variation from the classic multipurpose rattle snake, and I&#39;m glad to see that this is made in the same style as that one, although it&nbsp;kind of puts that old classic to shame, as it is a lot more detailed, and has some great printing.</p>

<p>If I don&#39;t display this minifigure with the rest of my collectable minifigures, I will use his turban along with the coachman&#39;s head from the <em>London Escape</em> set to make Sallah, and put him and the cobra in my <em>Well of Souls</em> set from the <em>Indiana Jones</em> line. All my spare snakes go in that set, and a cobra would be a very welcome addition, as one is featured prominently in the scene.</p>

<p>This is a good minifigure for both display, and part selection, and I&#39;m glad I got it.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-06T22:35:35.49Z","Impressive New Animal Piece.","<p><strong>Set #71008 Snake Charmer: </strong>This is a brilliant little fellow with some excellent new pieces and some great printed detail work.</p>

<p>The Snake Charmer features a single-sided torso print featuring an interesting looking green coat with some necklaces hanging around his neck. His facial expression indicates his flute playing with a round circular open mouth blowing air under a mustache, his cheeks are not printed to indicated that he&#39;s blowing though which is unfortunate. The coat print carries down onto the top of his legs.</p>

<p>For accessories he includes a simple wand as a flute to play, a brand new head piece for the turban which is sculpted quite well and looks very impressive and a brand new serpent piece for a coiled king cobra poised to strike. The Snake Charmer is in danger of being bitten if he stops playing his flute. Overall a great figure and definitely recommended.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-18T21:18:06.25Z","3 NEW MOULDS, and worth the PRICE!","<p>Series 13 is packed full of interesting and unconventional concepts and ideas, and I definitely see the Snake Charmer, the fourth in the set, falling into that category. He released back in 2015, like the rest in the series, and retailed for 4 dollars.</p>

<p>Atop the character is amongst the most interesting pieces found within the pack: his brand-new white turban piece, which was introduced here. This design HEAVILY improves&nbsp;the original standard turban, which was unattractively smooth and plain. This new mould is totally decked out and wrapped in an extensive amount of moulded detail, even at the back. A new turban was way overdue in the minifigure world. This character has an expressive face which sports a small handlebar moustache. His mouth accurately depicts him soothing his pet cobra. He doesn&#39;t incorporate any alternate prints.</p>

<p>I agree with LEGO&#39;s choice of using light green in the colour palette, since it blends beautifully into white. The various necklaces around him look superb, but sadly, he lacks back printing. The legs do a good job of making up for it, since they incorporate printing below the waist.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, both accessories were now for the figure. That pole, shockingly, was exclusive in this size, at the time, and it&#39;s 3L. I appreciate that, but I can definitely say it badly needs printing, since it is supposed to be an iconic flute. The cobra is yet another new mould. I dig the moulding and printing, as well as the colour choice of dark green, but it is completely done in rubber. I&#39;ve never been against LEGO&#39;s use of rubber casting, but I suppose it is more prone to breakage.</p>

<p>Overall, with 3 new moulds, this certainly impresses me, and thanks to the new&nbsp;turban and cobra moulds, it&nbsp;feels worth the price tag. This comes in at 5 points for me. Thanks for reading!</p>
