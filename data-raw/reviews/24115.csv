"8BrickMario","2015-01-05T22:23:46.27Z","Goblin it up!","<p>Like the Spooky Girl and Medusa before him, this was my&nbsp;&quot;instant connection&quot; figure for Series 13. He immediately stood out to me as an absolute must-have, and he is.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Series 13 packets are an incredibly vivid lime green, much more saturated than the official LEGO piece color, making them stand out. The usual design remains, but a &quot;Collect and WIN!&quot; tag has been added in red with a present logo to the upper corner. The pamphlet&#39;s design has changed, as each row of Minifigures on the checklist appears to be standing on a shelf or platform. The back has more &quot;Collect and WIN&quot; promotion for the MMO, and the Disco Diva, Hot Dog Man, and Snake Charmer are featured. Your Minifigure&#39;s code for the game is directly in the center.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Goblin has some excellent parts. His bag has been&nbsp;recolored for the second time since its introduction, appearing now in Dark Brown, and he has a flat silver goblin/orc sword. His hat is a great new sculpt, depicting a pointy brown hat with a &quot;widow&#39;s peak&quot; and the attached ears. What surprised me was that the ears are a separate color of plastic molded in, which is clearly visible when you look under the piece. The molding on the crooked tip on the hat is terrific, showing off some nice creasing and folds as the point drops down. The other pieces are useful enough, and the color scheme is well chosen. Some may lament the lack of printing on the backs of his legs, but I doubt such a method is feasible or effective, due to the holes. I think it&#39;s just fine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Goblin is just amazing. His face is perfectly designed, with an adorably wicked grin, glowing orange eyes shadowed in grey, and three sharp teeth. His hat has a great little patch printed on it, and his outfit is suitably ragged, with a laced-together vest (with another patch) and some fur-or-leather shorts. His arms are bare, but they didn&#39;t need to use dual-molded arms to give him short sleeves, in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple as can be, even though the rise of the MMO has led to the downfall of the instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s fantastic. He absolutely lived up to my expectations, and has become my current favorite minifigure. If you want him, definitely seek him out, because it&#39;s well worth it.&nbsp;</p>

This Goblin is really impressive because of the following.</p>

<p>The Goblin features a single sided torso print and leg printing of a scruffy looking vest, tattered pants with a rope belt and patches and a spooky looking facial print with evil glowing yellow eyes. Using a new head piece with Goblin ears attached to a patched cap and carrying a sack (no doubt full of gold) and a large scimitar for accessories this minifigure is just all kinds of fun.</p>

<p>Definitely recommend getting multiples of this one as they&#39;d make a great new enemy for the knights of LEGO Castle to do battle against.</p>

Not only is the fig exceptionally well designed, but the accessories are a great addition as well. As visible in the image, the printing is excellent, though surprisingly for a minifig that features dual-toned legs, the torso is only printed on the front. The design conveys a&nbsp;bedraggled, down-on-his-luck&nbsp;goblin who just scored a big steal.</p>

<p>Honestly, I picked up this guy to increased the number of unique orc/goblin faces I could field in an army. The up-side is the tone of this goblin&#39;s green ears perfectly matches the green of the <a href=""https://images.brickset.com/minifigs/large/lor011.jpg"">Moria&nbsp;Orcs</a> from set&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9473-1/The-Mines-of-Moria"">9473-1</a>. That means the goblin&#39;s hat and the Moria&nbsp;Orcs&#39; hair/ears piece are interchangeable, so you can mix up the look of a gang of orcs a bit more. The down-side is that the design of the goblin&#39;s face is quite a bit simpler than any of the LOTR/Hobbit orc designs, so it doesn&#39;t fit in them 100%. However, all in all I&#39;m very satisfied with this purchase.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a Castle or LOTR MOC-er, I&#39;d definitely recommend picking this guy up, he&#39;ll make a great addition to any evil army!</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-19T15:48:10.59Z","Great for fantasy-lovers!","<p>The fantasy genre is extremely popular with LEGO AFOL&#39;s, but nowadays, sets of that calibre are scantly released. It was equally rare in 2015; thus&nbsp;when Series 13 released, the Goblin was amongst the most popular. This series retailed for 4 dollars, and the Goblin includes 7 pieces.</p>

<p>Right off the bat is perhaps the most interesting piece here, that being his hat-ear combo, which is revolutionary for a few different reasons. First off, it was a brand-new mould that sports some surprising detail from all perspectives, even the crook at the back. A small ragged patch is printed off-centered to the middle, but what stands out to me the most is the green ears. See, they&#39;re actually dual-moulded into the hat! This was right around the time dual-moulding was becoming popular in LEGO, so seeing it in a CMF pack is definitely appreciated.</p>

<p>His sinister expression&nbsp;fits perfectly, as does the green tone it&#39;s caste in. If you&#39;re a LEGO Lord of the Rings fan like myself, this head is sure to be useful. The deep, yellow eyes are creepy as heck!</p>

<p>Another print reminiscent of Lord of the Rings is his torso, and the different shades of brown combined with olive green makes for a splendid colour palate that undoubtedly works well for the character. He does lack back printing, but I guess it can be excused.</p>

<p>Despite the hat, this figure released before dual-moulded legs were popular, so the legs do look a little bleak at the back. I&#39;m&nbsp;surprised at how well the brown pants match up at the sides, however.</p>

<p>Accessory-wise, the Goblin comes with two, the first of which is a dark brown sack, which was new to the figure in that colour. Of course, a giant blade is incorporated, which was far from a new piece, but is definitely a great inclusion.</p>

<p>Overall, I can see why this was a popular character in the series; it&#39;s fantastic! As if the figure wasn&#39;t already great, it&#39;s extremely generous to include two accessories. 5 out of 5!</p>
