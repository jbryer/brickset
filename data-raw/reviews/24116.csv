<p>The paleontologist has a single sided torso print, which is slightly unfortunate, however it&#39;s rare to find dual-sided torsos in the LEGO CMF line. She&#39;s wearing a nice kahki top with a scarf, her legs have minor printing as there is no dual molding here, just for the arms. Her facial expression is great and she&#39;s got an awesome looking new head piece with a large safari style exploration hat with attached hair in a ponytail. For accessories she included a bone and a printed stud with the image of an Ammonite.</p>

<p>Overall she&#39;s a great looking figure and I definitely recommend tracking her down if you missed her, she&#39;d make a great addition to the Research Institute Ideas set.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-24T00:02:34.54Z","Thankful for this figure!","<p>Hey everyone! Sideswinger here, and at the time of writing this, it&#39;s almost Thanksgiving. This figure has virtually nothing to do with that holiday, but since it&#39;s the next figure in my quest to review every CMF ever, I have to take a closer look at it. The Paleontologist was released in 2015, and she retailed for 4 dollars. Let&#39;s take a closer look!</p>

<p>Atop this character is a hair-hat combo that was introduced with this minifigure. I can&#39;t tell exactly, but I think it&#39;s caste in plastic. It appears to be dual-moulded, which is always a joy to see, especially since it wasn&#39;t overly common in 2015. Her face print looks great, though, though it resembles my step-grandma. She doesn&#39;t have an alternate expression.</p>

<p>On the mention of dual-moulding, the Palaeontologist&#39;s arms use tan and yellow, which work well together and are surprisingly useful. The torso is decorated with an ascot and some pockets, but unfortunately, she doesn&#39;t have any sort of back printing. The leg printing found here is great, considering it isn&#39;t&nbsp;all too necessary. It accurately depicts her yellow flesh.</p>

<p>As far as the accessories go, two are incorporated, both of which are incredibly fitting and useful. The white bone was not a new mould, but I&#39;m happy to see here. Her 1x1 fossil is a print which was long overdue in the world of LEGO, so I&#39;m thankful to see it here.</p>

<p>Overall, the Palaeontologist is amongst the most popular in this series, and for good reason. Her introduction of the new hair-hat combo, and the uses of dual-moulding combine to make this a memorable character that rakes in 5 points!</p>
