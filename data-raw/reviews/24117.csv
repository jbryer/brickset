<p>Looking at the body printing it looks like he could be a back -up &quot;Nova Corps Person&quot; with the yellow dots in the torso. &nbsp;Looking at the &quot;gun&quot; you can get more like them from &quot;The LEGO Movie&quot; sets off the &quot;robot cops&quot; (all you need to do is add a &quot;radar dish&quot; to the &quot;gun&quot;). &nbsp;Personally, I like to think the &quot;gun&quot; is a &quot;sonic cannon&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you use the feel method to find this guy. &nbsp;I would feel for the &quot;radar dish&quot;. &nbsp;It is easiest to find and he is the only guy in this series that comes with one. &nbsp;</p>

"pagani88","2015-08-10T14:03:51.04Z","Another Epic Alien!","<p>When I first saw images of series 13 CMFs, This one was my clear favorite, because I love collecting Aliens. And he looks like Dr John Zoidberg.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The standard CMF mystery bag fare, light green this time with eight of the sixteen minifigs to collect pictured on the front. In the top right is a &quot;collect and win&quot; sign and along the bottom is some writing in different languages. The back has more writing and a barcode. No instructions for this series, the collectors sheet has an advert for something on their website on it&#39;s reverse side where you can apparently enter a code and win things. Doesn&#39;t tell you what things.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>6 parts: The stand, the trans neon green radar dish (which isn&#39;t too common) the new gun with clip in dark blueish gray (as of writing this review that piece can only be found here,&nbsp;the Jurassic World sets and the Lego Movie sets) and the parts for the minifigure.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Of course, just this Alien Trooper. The radar dish is attached to the front of the gun (presumably to make it look like a stun blaster or something)which he holds. His torso is medium azure I think, and has darker blue armor around the top of his torso which has a little control panel thing at the bottom and 3 yellow orbs above that. Lower down on his torso is some purple detailing. This detailing is also on the back of the torso along with a continuation of his armor. Also on the back is a blue rectangle with detailing that looks like it could be a vent. He has light green hands and arms that are the same colour as his torso.<br />
&nbsp;The legs are medium azure too, with a blue waist. On the waist are three small yellow orbs. He has some more blue armour printed on the top of his legs and a bit more purple detailing that looks like padding on his knees. His head is a big, light green slightly rubbery piece with blue eyes, four tentacles instead of a mouth and some green spots. And of course, he has the usual black stand. Like I said, he looks like a green Zoidberg.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Won&#39;t be challenging anyone. I don&#39;t think I need to explain it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Just explained that.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great minifigure and will look good on display or attacking Lego City. Or being a bad doctor with an awful understanding of human anatomy if that&#39;s how you want it. I recomend this to lovers of minifigs, aliens and Futurama.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-07T17:10:03.697Z","BEWARE the ALIENS FROM THE THIRD DIMENSION!","<p><strong>Set #71008 Alien Trooper:</strong> These days the closest we get to more Classic Space inspired characters is in the CMF line, there is no dedicated Space Theme from LEGO and haven&#39;t been since Galaxy Squad. So it&#39;s nice to see these figures to help populate a Space Display.</p>

<p>The Alien Trooper uses a nice medium hue blue for his torso and legs, not exactly light, but not too dark either. His torso is printed double-sided with an awesome looking padded space suit with a pattern that is slightly familiar, three smaller dots circling a larger one, it&#39;s almost the symbol for Brainiac, though not quite. His legs have padded printing on his knees and some printing for his belt.</p>

<p>The head is a softer plastic which is quite rubbery, similar to most of the Simpsons heads. It&#39;s got a nice alien look to it with tentacles falling down where a mouth might be. He&#39;s also got some nice printing of a spotted pattern on his head. His accessory is a standard LEGO tranquilizer gun with a dish attached making a nice ray gun.</p>

<p>Overall this minifigure is really impressive, a lot of folks have likened it to a certain horror creature from Lovecraft, personally I just like the overall look of him. And his torso has some potential reuse. Recommended in large quantities and if you missed out on him before he&#39;d definitely look great with the rest of the Space CMF figures.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-25T15:36:43.703Z","an Intergalactic Gem!","<p>Many tropes have been overutilized in the CMF line, if you ask me, with multiple characters revolving around the same general concept. Even in 2015, space-themed figures were becoming repetitive, and Series 13 did nothing to change that, since 2 are included, the first of which is the Alien Trooper, who retailed for 4 dollars at launch.</p>

<p>Obviouly the most intriguing part of this figure is his big ol&#39; head piece, which was a completely new mould made exclusively for this figure. That head is caste in soft rubber, which I personally don&#39;t have a problem with, but I guess it is more prone to damage. The tentacles are nice touches, but the printed pattern atop the head is what really interests me. It&#39;s a very well done sculpt, all things considered.</p>

<p>The torso for this alien has more impressive detail, like the yellow bulb and the purple stomach. Shockingly, all those designs are carried onto the back, which is a touch I wouldn&#39;t expect to see, but is definitely appreciated. The legs continue the purple accents, but sadly, no side printing is incorporated.</p>

<p>His accessory is honestly pretty weak, but considering that wacky head sculpt, I am glad one was included at all. It was not a new gun mould, but rather, it&#39;s the typical tranquilizer piece often used in Jurassic World, but in this instance, a trans-yellow radar dish is pegged into the tip to create a radar gun. This accessory does its job nicely!</p>

<p>Overall, while I&#39;m not the biggest fan of LEGO space minifigures, I can&#39;t lie and say I dislike this figure. If he didn&#39;t use a new head sculpt, he&#39;d be about a 3, maybe even a 2. But his exclusive head bumps him up to a solid 4 out of 5. I&#39;m pleased with this figure!</p>
