What can I say? I love ancient Egypt, and was heavily influenced by the Mummy movies of the late 90s, early 2000s. They eventually made Anubis warriors, which I actually missed out on. But this guy, is absolutely great. Great new headpiece, accurate for the attire thought to be&nbsp;worn by Egyptian warriors (or at least, this is what they wore in tv shows/movies), awesome khopesh, the shield is probably my one downside, but&nbsp;I really wouldn&#39;t focus on it too much. Detailing on the torso and legs are also fantastic. The figure is probably more playable than others, seeing as how he has no extra accessories like a cape or skirt anything like that, and he&#39;s pretty easy to get. Awesome figure once again from LEGO. Keep &#39;em coming!</p>

"8BrickMario","2015-09-29T18:17:12.12Z","For the Pharaoh!","<p>This minifigure looked really nice when I saw Series 13. He&#39;s a good army-builder, and overall interesting in design.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for S13 is a very bright lime green, with a bit of red advertising for the MMO. The checklist is nice and clear, and the back has your minifigure&#39;s&nbsp;game&nbsp;code.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this one are pretty nice. The warrior&#39;s headdress and face&nbsp;could be reused in a few different Egyptian scenarios, and the golden khopesh is great to get, since the sword had previously only been available in dark metallic grey. The shield is a new piece, showing a simple design of the sun shining on a pyramid.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Of course, this was very easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like him. He looks really nice with his linen armor and his headdress. The headdress itself is printed with blue stripes all the way around the piece, with the stripes on the back being horizontal. His stoic expression and linen armor make me think he&nbsp;would be equally usable as a&nbsp;<em>shabti</em>, or burial statue, meant to serve the pharaoh in the afterlife.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this one is a nice one to have. It&#39;s the first time an Egyptian soldier has been made, and it&#39;s done well. He goes nicely with the Series 2 Pharaoh as a royal guard, too! I recommend finding him.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-07T17:16:56.23Z","Defenders of the Kings of Egypt.","<p><strong>Set #71008 Egyptian Warrior:</strong> Welcome to Historical Warriors of the LEGO Universe, yet again we find an awesome looking minifigure with some excellent detail work. He was so impressive I just had to buy four of him and here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>This figure has a double-sided torso print with a traditional Egyptian style of dress, his legs are made in traditional yellow with white printing for the wraps he&#39;s using for lower leg protection. Hinting perhaps at the ultimate fate of our warrior when his time comes to join the Pharaoh in his resting place. His facial expression is a neutral one, with some great attention to detailing that matches the look of Egyptian styled hieroglyphics.</p>

<p>For accessories you will find a brand new shield design with a pointed top that is more rounded that what is commonly found in LEGO Castle sets. He also gets a nice new sword piece, not a scimitar, but something in that same blade family, both accessories are in pearl gold with a great pyramid print on the front of the shield. His headdress is an awesome new head piece as well with excellent scultpt and printed detailing.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend this figure, he is one of the best offerings from Series 13 and you can&#39;t go wrong having a small squadron of them to flank the Series 5 Egyptian Queen. Great job LEGO.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-27T15:38:25.183Z","Walk like an Egyptian!","<p>The line of Collectible Minifigures, or CMF&#39;s, doesn&#39;t normally touch on people groups, or ethnicities; but when they do, it almost always makes for a good figure. Series 13 chose to include an ethnicity that I feel should have been made log before, that being an Egyptian. More specifically, the Egyptian Warrior, who released in 2015, and retailed for 4 dollars. The Egyptian Queen was included in Series 5, and the Pharaoh debuted in Series 2, but this is more centred around the Egyptian culture versus a single person.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, I gotta talk about his headdress, which was a brand-new piece made exclusively for this figure. The shaping on all sides is accurate, and the individual blue stripes are so well done that it almost appears dual-moulded, despite being printed. The gold band in front is a great touch as well. Ultimately, this headdress is my favourite part about this figure. I really appreciate this Warrior&#39;s head print! The accents beside his eyes add personality, but he doesn&#39;t have an alternate expression.</p>

<p>As far as the torso goes, this is surprisingly detailed, thanks to his back detailing, which continues his blue necklace and white straps. The details are extended onto the legs as well, which I certainly appreciate, and dang, those legs are packed with detailing, from the straps which hang from the front, to the intricate straps surrounding it. While no detailing is necessarily included, white printing is plastered onto the sides, which is yet another appreciated touch.</p>

<p>This warrior comes with two accessories: a sword, and a shield. More specifically, a khopesh, which was first introduced in dark metallic grey, and appears for the first time here in pearl gold. This golden shield was actually a new mould that was introduced here. I do like the tri-cornered design, and the markings on the front are great.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m a pretty big fan of Series 13 for the most part, and this Egyptian Warrior is one of my favorites. Sure, we had previously got 2 Egyptian-themed CMF&#39;s, but those were centered around historical characters, versus the Egyptian culture. I like this figure much more than them because of that, and I&#39;m impressed two new moulds were introduced. 5 out of 5!</p>
