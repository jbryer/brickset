<p>The Carpenter includes a parts re-use from The LEGO Movie, specifically Emmet&#39;s helmet with hair head piece. This is now in a lighter orange colour with a very light brown hair colour. His torso has limited printing with a visible bit of chest hair behind the collar of his buttoned up shirt, and a logo on the side of a hammer and axe. His pants come with a lot more printing, including a tool belt with numerous pouches full of such necessary tools as screwdrivers and a ruler. He also has dual molded arms for short sleeves.</p>

<p>He comes with the first ever LEGO hand saw for an accessory and a printed 1x4 tile that features a pattern for a two-by-four block of wood. This minifigure is great, I recommend tracking him down if you missed out on him, he&#39;s also good for parts.</p>

But if I were a hard-core CMF collector back in the day, I feel like this would be amongst my favourites of the series. People used to say this looked like Chris Pratt, and I guess I can see where they&#39;re coming from. Series 13 released in January 2015, where it retailed for 4 dollars.</p>

<p>Some might think that hair hat combo atop the head was a brand new piece, but it is, in fact, a recolour of Emmet&#39;s hat from The LEGO Movie Series which released in 2012. Its appearance here is absolutely genius, and it looks best in this colour scheme of dark yellow and nougat. His face is why most people refer to him as Chris Pratt, and I won&#39;t lie; it does look a lot like the head piece used for Owen in Jurassic World, who was of course, played by Pratt. This is an extremely useful expression for custom characters, and it actually looks a lot like my dad.</p>

<p>Now that I mention it, this whole figure looks like my dad! The torso is unbelievably useful, thanks to the light blue dress shirt, though that small emblem does sort of break the design. He doesn&#39;t have back printing, but he more than makes up for it with the use of dual-moulded blue and yellow arms. The details don&#39;t stop there. Take a look at the legs! Multiple real-life tools are accurately depicted, such as screwdrivers, pliers, and even a ruler. That belt at the top makes for a super useful waist connection piece, and I like how asymmetrical they are.</p>

<p>As if this figure isn&#39;t good enough already, not one, but two accessories are included. He cleverly uses a printed 1x4 tile to represent a plank of wood. It makes for a clever and insanely useful print, and it&#39;s one that I hope to get someday. However, my favourite part of the figure has got to be his handsaw, which as you might imagine, was an entirely new mould exclusive to this figure. The detail on the blade is fantastic, as is the curvature around the handle.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;ve been generous with most of my Series 13 scores, but dang it, I gotta give this another 5 out of 5. It&#39;s a genius concept that could not have been executed better.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
