"8BrickMario","2015-01-05T22:39:20.867Z","I am Ming...the Devil?","<p>This was another minifigure that stood out to me, mostly due to his impressive cape! And it&#39;s pretty clear that this guy is based on&nbsp;<em>Flash Gordon</em>&#39;s Ming the Merciless, but I wanted him regardless of that. Was he worth it?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is a great new color for the series, and the checklist has a change in display, placing the characters on rendered platforms. Otherwise, nothing much of note beside the persistent&nbsp;promotion for&nbsp;<em>LEGO Minifigures Online</em>&nbsp;and the code with the minifigure you purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>First off--the cape. The cape is very large and a completely new cut of fabric for this character, consisting of a collar piece and the cape.&nbsp;The base of the cape is almost crescent-shaped, and it is the typical starched material. The collar is pointed on the sides and round in the middle, and both pieces are dark red with black printing creating flame decorations. This is impressively extravagant for any minifigure cape, and it&#39;s nice that it isn&#39;t the soft material that came with the previous Wizard,&nbsp;since it frays easily. He comes with the Evil Dragon Wizard/Evil Wu beard, no hat or hair (due to the character allusion), a slope piece-instant giveaway in the bags- and some basic parts to create his staff.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>He&#39;s evil...can&#39;t you tell? But seriously, the cape, the red eyes, the beard, the flaming staff...he&#39;s delightfully over-the-top. The robe&#39;s printing is nice, with some golden flame bordering and under the robe, a large golden skull design can be seen above some dotted embroidery...all of those dots are also skulls. Wow. No wonder some people compare him to the Devil himself! This character has a pretty fun design, since it&#39;s almost tongue-in-cheek with the extents they went to to make him so obviously evil. I think it works, though, and I enjoy it. The cape&#39;s collar is almost at a right angle to the head, but that&#39;s perfectly appropriate, and overall, he just looks good.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is one of the only problems with this guy. It&#39;s extremely difficult to put the beard and head on over the cape, since it&#39;s the stiff fabric. The best way to go about it is to put the head into the beard, and put both over the neckpost. Be sure the cape is aligned properly, though.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This guy is pretty good. He&#39;s a fun reference to Flash Gordon, a humorously over-the-top villain, and he has some useful pieces. The only problem is with the above-torso assembly, but if you find him, I would say he&#39;s a good choice.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-07T18:25:14.303Z","Conjuring Flames of Evil!","<p><strong>Set #71008 Evil Wizard: </strong>After getting the Good Wizard, or just plain Wizard as he was called, LEGO decided to create an Evil Wizard to do battle against him.</p>

<p>Made primarily of all red pieces this minifigure has a very uniform look. Some might compare him to Ming the Merciless from Flash Gordon, I guess that makes about as much sense as anything really. He has a simple print that goes down the front of his torso and continues onto his sloped brick for his skull themed robes. He includes two separate cape pieces with a flame pattern on them which enhances his evil look, and his staff shoots fire from the top.</p>

<p>Overall he&#39;s an ok figure, I have issues with the use of the beard piece along with two separate cape pieces, it makes it very difficult to line everything up properly and the beard refuses to sit flush against the torso because the cape pushes it out of alignment. This means the head can be moved far too easily in my opinion knocking the facial expression out of alignment and looking weird. Instead of going with the Fun Manchu style evil beard it might have been better to give him a head piece and keep his face clean shaven. I&#39;d still recommend him to complete the full set, however aside from the evil look that matches quite nicely with the Dwarf from Series 5 I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m a bit meh with this one.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-11-30T17:38:25.927Z","Evil to the core!","<p>The tenth minifigure found in Series 13 is the Evil Wizard. He released in 2015, where he retailed for 4 dollars and includes 10 pieces. This was an evil counterpart to the Series 12 Wizard.</p>

<p>So the first part of this character is that head piece, which has a fantastic expression, despite being covered by the beard. Red eyes certainly add to the aesthetic, but the gash covering his face is menacing as heck. Underneath that beard is a simple frown, but speaking of which, that black beard is nice to get in this cheap blind bag, however it was not new for the figure in that colour. I appreciate the pointy edges, and it certainly adds to the overall character.</p>

<p>As far as that cape goes, they&#39;re two separate pieces, which are&nbsp;always a pain to apply. This figure in particular is extremely fidgety to assemble, and it&#39;s practically impossible to accurately line up.&nbsp;It feels worth it in the end, however. It&#39;s worth noting how it vaguely follows the shape of the Series 12 Wizard, which is accurately consistent. I love how far it extends on either side of the character, and the overall shaping, especially at the collar, certainly looks menacing. The devilish flames are pretty dark for a CMF, but I fancy the inclusion.</p>

<p>As far as the torso goes, It has enough printing to satisfy me. The golden skull accents the golden trim nicely, and it seamlessly matches with the dress piece. More golden flames are applied to the trim, and I really appreciate the checkered pattern behind it.</p>

<p>Lastly, we have his accessory, and again, it matches the staff from the Series 12 Wizard. Consisting of three pieces, a black pole attaches to a black telescope piece, which is topped off by a translucent red flame. The whole assembly feels very fitting!</p>

<p>Overall, I used to sort of dislike this character, but he&#39;s definitely grown on me. I wouldn&#39;t say he&#39;s my favourite of the set or anything, but I feel he&#39;s executed masterfully. I&#39;m gonna score him with 4 points!</p>
