<p>The Fencer is&nbsp;a great looking minifigure with a very simple build, he&#39;s all white and has minimal printing on his torso and legs for the standard fencing uniform design. His head gear is a brand new sculpt which looks great, the wire mesh looking face mask is a really nice touch and I enjoy the very authentic look of the character. The only non-white colours on this figure is the head and the single hand, everything else is white. His accessory is the rapier weapon first seen in Series 4 if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>Overall a really fun figure and I&#39;d definitely recommend this one as one of the better ones from the series.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Attention to detail.</p>

<p>Low price (when it was new).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Minifigs cannot really pose in a fencing stance.</p>

<p>Limited appeal.</p>

<p>Low piece count (unavoidable for the subject matter).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>I think they did a good job making this figure look like a fencer.&nbsp; I bought 3 (one for my fencing instructor, 2 as pawns for a fencing game I made).&nbsp; It is too bad the price of CMFs is so high now.</p>

<p>On top of the figure is the most interesting piece of the figure, that being his fencing mask. It&#39;s a mould I don&#39;t think we ever would have got, had this figure not been made. I appreciate how the mask is accurately vented, and the silver printing is absolutely superb. Obviously, that was an entirely new mould. Underneath that mask is a surprisingly fantastic head piece, which depicts a determined yet playful expression that could easily be useful outside this setting.</p>

<p>The torso doesn&#39;t have a whole lot happening, which is accurate to real-life fencing uniforms. He doesn&#39;t have any back printing, which is pretty disappointing, but I love the plain yellow hand on his left arm, which he uses to wield the accessory. The legs have a very minimal amount of detail, which I have no issue wth.</p>

<p>Accessory wise, he includes a fitting rapier blade, and there is obviously no greater inclusion. It wasn&#39;t a new piece by a long shot, but it&#39;s one I always love seeing.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a very niche concept, however it&#39;s one I love seeing, and it&#39;s executed marvellously! The new head sculpt is a great touch, and thanks to his head print, I&#39;m giving him a 4 out of 5!</p>
