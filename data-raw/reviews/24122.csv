<p>She has a nice elegant print on her torso with some extra printing on her legs that matches the frontal print on her armour, it&#39;s all very nicely done and isn&#39;t specifically feminine in design so you can use the torso, legs and armour for MOCing loads of samurai. Even her facial expression isn&#39;t overtly feminine, she has a very strong look to her because of this fact. Her hair comes from Series 3, it started being used with the Sumo Wrestler and carried on for many other uses.</p>

<p>I&#39;d strongly recommend her as one of the best figures in the line and you definitely want to pick up a fair number of them for MOC army building.</p>

This Samurai released in 2015 for 4 dollars, where she includes 8 pieces.</p>

<p>Atop the figure is a hairpiece I always love seeing in CMF&#39;s. It was originally introduced in Series 3 with the Sumo Wrestler, but has been reused a few times since then. I still love the moulded detail regarding her bun at the back of the head.</p>

<p>One of the highlights on this character has got to be her armour. It wasn&#39;t a new mould, but it features some exclusive printing that looks undeniably pretty good. The moulding on her shoulder-pads are good, though they do jut out slightly too far. The armor was entirely new for the figure in that brick red color. I&#39;m slightly impressed with the torso detailing underneath, which depcits a red robe. The colors work well with the dark gray arms, and the continuation of dark red armor is integrated with the legs.</p>

<p>For accessories, she includes two simple katanas, which are very fitting accessories. They&#39;re pretty useful in black.</p>

<p>Overall, this figure is a conondrum for me, because she looks decent enough, she&#39;s just a very boring gender swap of an already weak figure. If she brought a new take on the trope, I would be much more generous in my rankings, but unfortunately, she does not. I&#39;m gonna have to give her a 3 out of 5, and she&#39;s undoubtedly my least favorite of the set.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
