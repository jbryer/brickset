<p>There is a lot of side printing on her, her legs include side printing with bell bottomed pants, her arms feature side printing with psychedelic tie dye printing which matches her tied off top on the front and sides of the torso. She includes a pair of white skates, a golden microphone (similar to the Rapper from Series 3) and a brunette afro. She&#39;s got a lovely looking facial print too with an open mouthed smile and a pair of star shades over her eyes.</p>

<p>Very recommended if you missed her you&#39;re going to want to pick one up, maybe more for crowd scenes and the awesome parts she has with such great printing.</p>

The thirteenth character in the set, the Disco Diva, certainly falls within that category, being a remake of the Series 2 Disco Dude. She was released in 2015, where she retailed for 4 dollars, and includes 8 pieces.</p>

<p>Amongst the best parts of the figure is by no debate that afro. It was not a new piece by a long shot, and it was included in the original 2010 Disco Dude, but this was the first time we ever got it in dark brown, which is useful. The individual bumps and creases, as well as the crazy amount of greabling come together for a phenomenal looking sculpt that I always enjoy getting! The Diva&#39;s head piece is brilliant, with those star-shaped purple sunglasses. Her open-mouthed expression is meant to replicate her singing.</p>

<p>The torso printing here is very intricate and detailed, sporting numerous multicoloured circles. The colour scheme here is fantastic, using white, and different shades of violet. The printing around the arms are perhaps the most detailed of the series, but all the detail from the front is carried onto the back, something which I find impressive! But the details don&#39;t stop there! The sides of the legs add more circles, and the front has a nice chain-mail belt.</p>

<p>Her accessories are nothing to get worked up over, However I&#39;m impressed that microphone is included at all, given how otherwise detailed this character is. Getting the mic in gold is brilliant, but my favourite accessories&nbsp;are her white roller skates, which weren&#39;t even necessary! This is the only set with those parts in white.</p>

<p>Overall, though this is simply a gender swap, I&#39;m impressed how much detail was packed within. No new pieces or sculpts were made for her, but she doesn&#39;t need any, since she&#39;s already such a cool figure. Overall, I&#39;m giving her a 4 out of 5!</p>
