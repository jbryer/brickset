<p>This character was the most anticipated by far of the Series 13 cast. He&#39;s wacky, unique, and fun. But was he worth hunting down?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Series 13 packaging. I don&#39;t know what to say now, I always get burned out after a couple of reviews of each series on this section. The bag and pamphlet are eye-catching and appealing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only standout part here is the huge hot dog costume. It&#39;s a large painted piece that slides over the head and torso, restricting leg movement. Otherwise, he&#39;s pretty bland, with a plain tan torso and unprinted blue legs. His face is nice, though.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t get the hype. I like the character, he&#39;s weird and silly, but also based on real life, but I don&#39;t know. I have little use for him in any environment; the best use in a city setting I can think of would be the Fairground Mixer set. Or a costume party. His bland torso and legs aren&#39;t of much use either. I think they missed a good opportunity to give him a sausage piece, but he&#39;s all right, I suppose. Just not my cup of tea.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The simplest one in the whole series, as he only includes four parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Get him if you want him. To me, he&#39;s a restricted novelty character with little application in LEGO scenarios. I think they did a great job in his execution, and the costume piece is very well made, but he isn&#39;t a character I would buy any more than one of.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t like that one side of the included pamphlet is completely dedicated to the minifigures online website and game with a game code. &nbsp;I liked when it shows all of the available character&#39;s accessories.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only thing lacking here is some condiments or an actual sausage/hot dog which they already manufacture.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Great figure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing to say here really, it&#39;s only 4 parts, nothing interesting of note.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great and even acts as a conversation piece. &nbsp;It&#39;s surprising to everyone and is a really joyful model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m quite happy to see them break the mold here and hope this means more non-animal mascots to come in future CMF series figs. &nbsp;Will absolutely pair this guy up with the hot dog stand polybag that currently stands in front of the Town Hall modular.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-18T18:30:42.797Z","Hot Dogs! Get your Hot Dogs Here!","<p><strong>Set #71008 Hot Dog Guy: </strong>After twelve series of previous Minifigures, and getting everything from historical characters, costumed mascots and unique characters not seen in regular Themes. But this is the first Food Mascot you&#39;re going to see, and this is the one biggest in-demand figure from Series 13.</p>

<p>He has no printing outside of the facial expression, he has a pair of light blue pants and a very light brown top which has no printing, why? Because everything about this figure is for the detail work in the sculpted head piece that slides over the torso and legs. The Hot Dog suit is sheer brilliance, you get to see the bun, the hot dog and a squibble of mustard with a slit in the top to see his face.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to want so many of these characters I am going to just say it, get him. If you don&#39;t collect CMFs at all you will want this figure, because he is just such a useful character for populating LEGO City displays and MOCs and everything you can imagine, baseball field MOCs, Hot Dog carts, some interesting restaurant or theater builds. Great figure.</p>

"coloagnt1","2015-02-20T05:30:51.253Z","Whimsical Hot Dog Man is one of coolest of Series 13!!","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The &quot;usual&quot; when it comes to CMF&#39;s.</p>

<p>Too bad the back of the insert no longer shows all the various different parts/accessories rather the online game info. &nbsp;They should return that style or combine a little of both come next series.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Five total. &nbsp;The legs and midsection by themselves are quite boring. &nbsp;Having said that, with &nbsp;the Hot Dog costume, they are mostly or partially hidden.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very Simple</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Hot Dog man is actually my favorite of this series. &nbsp;He is an original where repetition is becoming more prevalent with each new series.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Picked up a couple of these, for my own collection and as whimsical Lego(iconic) gifts!</p>

"The_Scooby_Fan","2015-06-28T14:01:20.307Z","Do You Know the Hot Dog Man?","<p>The Hot Dog Man is a cool little minifigure, one of my favorites in series thirteen. Although he&#39;s just a regular minifig&nbsp;underneath, adding the hot dog costume makes him unique.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Hot Dog Man is the easiest to feel for in this series, due to his giant hot dog suit. I never bother to check if there are instructions in these, as they are super easy to build.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Hot Dog Guy contains all the average minifig parts, but he also contains that hot dog, which I am pretty sure is unique to this one blind bag.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Overall, the Hot Dog Guy is a great minifig.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Short, simple, easy. I enjoy building minifigs, but I can&#39;t really build a Lego set without messing up.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model fits right into my nearly complete set of minifigures series thirteen. He looks great!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think the Hot Dog Guy is a great figure, and if you are looking for him, my advice would be to feel for the hot dog costume, you can&#39;t miss it.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-12-06T00:24:53.157Z","I wish I were an Oscar Mayer Weiner!","<p>LEGO CMF&#39;s are especially popular while sporting some sort of costume, and by this point in the CMF line, we had the Gorilla Suit Guy, Lizard Man, Bunny Suit Guy, Chicken Suit Guy, Bumblebee Girl, Panda Guy, Piggy Guy, and Unicorn Girl, all of which are based off real life animals. What non-animal costumes could LEGO come up with? Well, Series 13 includes your answer, because the first ever Collectable Minifigure food costume character was&nbsp;14th in the set. Hot Dog Man was released in January 2015, where he retailed for 4 dollars and includes 5 pieces.</p>

<p>I think this goes without saying, but my favourite&nbsp;part of this figure is obviously the massive hot dog mould, which is an entirely new mould that was made specifically for this figure. It&#39;s visually appealing, but the moulded detail is great as well! It consists of three different colours: the peach bun, the dark red hot dog, and the yellow-orange mustard. That sculpt pegs into the head using an anti-stud, but it extends upwards past the head, and downwards past the legs. The colour choice for the bun is perfect, in my opinion, since it doesn&#39;t clash against the head. On that note, this head piece is incredibly useful! This chipper, toothy grin is exquisite, and so simple, yet super effective.</p>

<p>This weiner lacks torso printing, but I will admit, it&#39;s great seeing&nbsp;a minifigure torso and arms caste in peach. I also love this dude&#39;s pants, which are incredibly useful&nbsp;in light blue without printing, since they resemble pants.</p>

<p>Overall, this figure doesn&#39;t have an accessory, which makes complete sense, thanks to the new hot dog piece. This is the perfect LEGO Minifigure! It has a well-thought of concept that was extremely fresh and unique, and its executed so darn well, with nice colours and prints. This is an easy 5 out of 5 for me, and it is undoubtedly amongst my favourites in the series.</p>
