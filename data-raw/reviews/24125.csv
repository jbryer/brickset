<p>She (like all of the Series 13 Minifigures) comes in a bright green packet for the series. The instruction sheet of previous series is no more, as the side used to show how to build a minifigure has been replaced with a code and promotion for the MMO. The front still features the normal checklist.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>She has some pretty nice parts, and probably the most coveted parts of her are&nbsp;the rare Sand Blue hands. Her entire colorscheme is Sand Blue and Olive Green. She reuses the cyclops mask previously seen on her Series 9 predecessor, and she has the minifigure&nbsp;club piece new in Light Grey, which is not readily apparent from pictures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Lady Cyclops is hilariously designed. While her makeup was lamented by several, LEGO designed her with makeup as a joke, since it&#39;s such a ridiculous contrast with her appearance. She has a brutish, ugly, ogreish face...with pink lipstick, a beauty mark, and blue eyeshadow! I think it&#39;s the right touch of LEGO&#39;s trademark silliness, and it only enhances the figure for me. Her skin is Sand Blue, and her crude garments are Olive Green, which is a complete swap of colors from the Cyclops before her. Her garments are roughly cut, pinned together with bones,&nbsp;and expose her stomach.&nbsp;Her back printing continues the pattern.&nbsp;She has minimal curves printing, and at the waist, the curves do not give her a skinny waist, but rather, a big belly! Her minifigure head has two expressions. One is with her massive eye completely open, and the other has it half-closed, showing off her eyeshadow. The mouth on both sides is very small and squished due to the size of her eyeball.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took only seconds.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like her quite a lot. She&#39;s designed well, with the right kind of humor, and she goes well with the previous Cyclops. If you can appreciate the makeup and like the figure, I would definitely recommend trying to find her.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-18T18:39:14.78Z","Mythological Monstrosities Arise Once More.","<p><strong>Set #71008 Lady Cyclops: </strong>Not too long ago we received a male cyclops for our mythical creature collection from LEGO CMF Series 9. Now we have a female version of the creature and she looks like a cross between a cyclops and a cave woman considering her costume choice.</p>

<p>The double-sided torso print has a ratty looking halter top, made out of some strange green fabric, and she&#39;s wearing a matching pair of furry shorts. Her head piece and club are exactly the same as the original Cyclops with different printing and markings to indicate her female nature. Her head is double-sided, just as the male Cyclops had, this time you&#39;ll find a wide eyed happy expression and a droopy eyed tired expression, perhaps she needs a cup of coffee every morning.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend this figure for mythology fans, if you aren&#39;t looking to get all 16 characters and this one doesn&#39;t interest you that much you can safely skip her, otherwise you&#39;ll definitely be picking her up.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-12-06T02:57:54.563Z","meh","<p>Series 13 has a couple gender swaps, which isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing. If a gender swap introduces a new, fresh take on the trope, it can make for a great character! However, they aren&#39;t always keepers, and that&#39;s gotta be the case with the fifteenth figure in Series 13, that being Lady Cyclops. She released in 2015 where she retailed for 4 bucks, and includes 6 pieces.</p>

<p>The first piece to begin the figure is the cyclops head, which was not a new sculpt. It was first introduced with the Cyclops, found in Series 9, however here, it&#39;s caste in sand blue, which was a new colour for that piece. I do appreciate the colouring and the printing regarding the white horns, tusks, and magenta lipstick, but it feels stereotypical and forced to me. Interestingly, the cyclops head is separate from the standard minifigure head underneath, which feels odd, but the separate head allows for two expressions regarding the singular eye. The main expression shows a cute, wide-eyed look, while the alternate has a squint that adds character.</p>

<p>The torso here appears relatively plain, but it certainly isn&#39;t bad. I dig the bone strap, however I wish to have seen dual-moulded arms. I am satisfied with her back printing! The legs have surprisingly good detail, which sports olive green, tattered shorts. They carry onto the sides, though they&#39;re fairly disjointed from the front. Again, I appreciate the bone print.</p>

<p>This figure has an incredibly lazy accessory. Sure, it fits, but we got a club in the original Series 9 Cyclops, so getting something more interesting would definitely have been appreciated.</p>

<p>Overall, this is not a very great figure. She looks decent, don&#39;t get me wrong, but she&#39;s way too similar to the Series 9 Cyclops for me to see her as anything other than a lazy gender swap. She doesn&#39;t bring anything new to the trope, and ultimately, the whole design feels too rehashed. I&#39;m giving her a 2 out of 5, unfortunately.</p>
