<p>Galaxy trooper is a very cool minifigure, perfect for army building thanks to how common he is.His head has two faces: gray one that you see on the main image, it represents a futuristic vizor, and a normal yellow one with &#39;serious&#39; expression on it.</p>

<p>There are no prints on the torso but you don&#39;t see it normally so it&#39;s not a problem. There&#39;s quite a bit of printing on the armor though, both in front and on the back. It has two clips for his guns to hold and they look like wings a bit (with guns attached). He also has a metallic gray stripe on the helmet and some printing on the legs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s awesome for building a space army and as a standalone minifigure too. I highly recommend it!</p>

"Black_Leader","2016-04-02T03:06:27.897Z","The Ranger of Space","<p>When Series 13 first came out in January 15, the Galaxy Trooper was a figure that many, including myself, originally overlooked. Compared with the obvious appeal of standouts like the Classic King and the Hot Dog Man, or the new wondrous new parts included with the Snake Charmer and the Carpenter, the Galaxy Trooper seemed relegated to obscurity within the series. Our space-faring friend&rsquo;s case was also not helped by the fact that he appeared to be an evolution of the popular Galaxy Patrol minifigure from Series 7. However, once he is given more than a cursory glance, one will find that this figure is special indeed!</p>

<p><strong>Head</strong><br />
The Galaxy Trooper&rsquo;s head is one of just two in the series that is double-sided, with the other being the Lady Cyclops. The main side features a sand blue HUD with nice scope printing, under which the trooper sports a wide, confident grin. The opposite side is less impressive, as it is just a plain yellow face featuring a solemn expression. This stoic demeanor is to me reminiscent of the calm face of Legolas&rsquo;s minifigure, albeit without the cheek lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Torso and Legs</strong><br />
The torso is easily the most boring component, being just a plain black torso with dark bluish grey hands. No printing is not a detriment here, because most of it would have been covered by the armor anyway, though a little back detailing where the torso is exposed would have welcome. The legs are only slightly more refined, with the printing consisting of knee pads with a silver sheen and lines that resemble pockets. Nothing fancy, but certainly adequate for what the character is supposed to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong><br />
If this figure did evoke any exclamations of delight when it was first revealed, it was certainly because of the unique armor piece he sports, though it has since been used on Batman. I personally adore this paraphernalia, as it sleek and includes great printing, with a silver stripe down the center and two different black icons presumably representing whatever organization the Galaxy Trooper serves. The logo of what seems to be a shuttle taking flight also appears in a larger form on the armor&rsquo;s back. This armor, with its ribbed abdomen and lack of exposed studs, is so streamlined that it makes the armor of Galaxy Patrol look sadly chunky and outdated by comparison. Another improvement in this armor are the two gun clips in the back, perfect for storage when your hero needs to settle a dispute with good old fashioned fists. These guns are nothing remarkable, just being the same futuristic double barreled version introduced with the Alien Conquest theme. The helm of the Galaxy Trooper is the same one worn by the Galaxy Patrol, only this time in dark bluish gray with a metallic gray stripe running down the center. Lego has certainly come a long way in 3 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong><br />
In short, the Galaxy Trooper is a must have for anyone interested in Lego Space and good for any minifigure fan in general. He is perfect for army building and combating the Alien Trooper found in the same series. The Galaxy Patrol figure may have been supplanted, but it is easy to imagine them as belonging to the same unit, just being from different time periods that naturally had different technologies. Galaxy Trooper is an easy find, so don&rsquo;t forget about him!</p>

<p>The Galaxy Trooper is a companion for the Galaxy Patrol from Series 7, he&#39;s got the same helmet, but features a different armour piece which I believe is brand new, it includes some nice limited printing for logos of some organization and some clips on the back to attach his guns. There&#39;s no printing on his torso underneath, and only a minor pit of printing for pants details on his legs, plus some printing to add colour to his helmet. And he&#39;s got two of the space guns, his face is dual sided with an expression on one side that is serious and determined while the other side includes a HUD print over his grinning facial expression.</p>

<p>Overall this is one of my favorites from this line and I just can&#39;t recommend it enough. You&#39;re going to want&nbsp;loads to populate some fun MOCs or just regular Classic Space LEGO Theme collections.</p>

"sideswinger","2022-12-22T14:30:36.213Z","a FANTASTIC remake!","<p>I am far from the biggest fan of CMF space figures, considering numerous have been produced since the start of the line in 2010. With that being said, they&#39;re normally highly detailed. Series 13 contains two space-themed figures, the Alien Trooper and the Galaxy Trooper, the latter of which is the last in the series and includes 8 pieces. The Galaxy Trooper retailed for 4 US dollars and released in 2015.</p>

<p>The Trooper reuses the Series 7 Galaxy Patrol helmet in a new dark grey colour, which is always great to get. The moulding surrounding that sculpt always impresses me, especially at the sides. The face prints complement him nicely! The standard expression showcases some holographic blue texturing, with inscribed text and lettering, while his alternate expression consists of yellow flesh and a useful stern expression. An alternate expression was incredibly unnecessary here, which makes me appreciate its inclusion even more. My guy&#39;s helmet is darn incredible, even though it&#39;s not a new mould. It fits the character so well, and I couldn&#39;t imagine a better helmet to use in this situation. It&#39;s caste in dark grey, and it sports some great moulding on all sides.</p>

<p>The high-quality doesn&#39;t stop there! This trooper&#39;s breastplate was an entirely new mould made for this character, which is something I highly appreciate! It&#39;s visually fantastic, with the moulded ridges at the front. I also dig the small emblems adjourning his chest. Shoulder coverings decorate the arm, and two clips are moulded into the back, presumably to store his blasters. Unfortunately, no torso printing whatsoever is incorporated, which I find a little sad, but understandable, since the rest of the figure is so detailed. His legs have some small decals, like the silver knee-pads, which unfortunately do not carry onto the sides.</p>

<p>As far as accessories go, this guy comes with two, and like I&nbsp;said earlier, that&#39;s crazy, given the amount of detail the figure itself already has. His two blasters are not new moulds, but I love getting them here, since they match the overall aesthetic. They&#39;re caste in black, which is a great choice.</p>

<p>Overall, gosh, I love this figure. Not only is it a fantastic remake of the Series 7 Galaxy Patrol, but it&#39;s executed insanely well, with the introduction of a new mould. The aesthetic is futuristic and fitting, and overall, I gotta give him a 5 out of 5! Thanks for reading, and Merry Christmas!</p>
