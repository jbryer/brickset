"Qazzian","2015-05-30T23:15:36.12Z","Difficult to build","<p>This was part of the in-store build for the UK star wars day. The staff gave them away and helped the kids to build the model. This one was particularly difficult for the small kids as it kept falling apart. It was also easy to get some of the pieces the wrong way round.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions&nbsp;are very easy and simple to understand. Instructions are just one sheet folded up so no turning&nbsp;pages. The front of the&nbsp;polybag looks nice&nbsp;showing the TIE fly over Lothal.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of grey pieces included in this set&nbsp;which are great for&nbsp;MOCs, especially when building spaceships. There aren&#39;t any rare pieces in this set so not much to look at&nbsp;here.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigures are included.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite simple, you build two halves of the ship and then the wings. The build is quite repetitive&nbsp;so there isn&#39;t anything that really fascinated me while building this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall, it looks kind of chunky. It&#39;s nice though, it has good &quot;pick up and fly around&quot; feeling. My only problem is the wings don&#39;t lock into place so they can look uneven and it&#39;s hard to get all the wings nice and even. I guess I&#39;m being picky but that&#39;s my only problem with it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I like it! It&#39;s fun to play with and looks fairly nice. I&#39;m not sure I would recommend it over some polybags&nbsp;but&nbsp;nevertheless it&#39;s still good. If you like TIE Fighters,&nbsp;Rebels or grey pieces,&nbsp;this would make a good addition to your collection!&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-05-19T14:30:13.023Z","Inquisitors Chosen Vessel","<p><strong>Set # 30275 TIE Advanced Prototype: </strong>This isn&rsquo;t a terrible polybag, but it is a bit weaker compared to the AT-DP walker. Still it&rsquo;s not that bad for what it is, so read on to find out my thoughts on the pros and cons of this set.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Design is gorgeous, looks very good for this scale and the build is highly impressive.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Really fun vehicle to play with, speeding it through the air is just great.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Wing panels are not too intrusive and love the way they&rsquo;ve handled the entire build for them.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Build is repetitive.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Difficult to differentiate the front from the back of the vehicle, mostly a problem with the design personally. In the case of this set I&rsquo;d have to say it&rsquo;s probably because the cockpit is a clear radar dish instead of one printed with TIE window.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Piece count could use something, toss in an Inquisitor Minifigure and this might have been more worth the price-per-piece ratio.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Overall not a bad polybag, and the packaging and design of the build is quite nice. The repetitive nature may turn some people off, and the all grey colouring is a bit blander compared to Vader&rsquo;s TIE Advanced from A New Hope. Recommended for fans of this scale, polybags and people who love having armies of miniaturized Starfighters for a cheap price.</p>

<p>Normal polybag&nbsp;with the normal polybag&nbsp;size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There are no special or unique parts in the set that you don&#39;t get in any other set.&nbsp;The total piece count is 47.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Really quick and easy took me under 2 minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall it is really nice Imperial Tie Advance. The ability to adjust the wings almost 180 degrees&nbsp;is a really nice feature.&nbsp;Also it resembles the larger scale version, which is really nice as well.&nbsp;Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-04-24T09:02:27.717Z","Kept me occupied for a maximum of 3 minutes of lockdown...","<p>This set is my one and only set from the Star Wars Rebels range, and, I have to admit, that the experience wasn&#39;t great. I have a fair amount of poly bags and a couple of boxed city sets in my &#39;rainy day&#39; stash. I am entering a poly bag competition, and this was the only place that I could find a certain piece. That is the true reason I opened this poly bag, besides to have little fun during lockdown.&nbsp;I haven&#39;t watched the whole&nbsp;series, but I know enough that I understand that Darth Vader has ordered&nbsp;a few creepy guys (and girls) to go around with new lightsabre tech and kill the remaining Jedi, namely Kanan, Ezra and eventually Ahsoka. With that out of the way, I shall start my third picture review.</p>

<h3>Packaging/Instructions:</h3>

<p>The set comes in a poly bag. It contains a fold-out leaflet with easy to follow steps. I have one complaint about the instructions; the first side is very spacious, whereas the other side seems rushed and squeezed together.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49833739311_6a8e8a3ddd_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 95px;"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834044317_85ec9bdbbe_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 136px;"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49833202998_d6702b8fe0_o.jpg"" style=""width: 93px; height: 136px;"" /></p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>This set is not renowned for its piece rarity, I&#39;ll tell you that right now. We get 47 pieces included in the build and one spare translucent-red stud, which brings the actual total up to 48. The rarest piece in the set is the 3x3 1/4 circle piece, which, in medium-stone grey, appears in 21 sets. However, the piece I was looking for was the 2x4 plate with 3 holes in it, which appears in a total of 93 other sets, none of which I have. The most curious inclusion was the cross technic pin, which didn&#39;t make much sense to me originally.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49833739291_93e0937c34_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 123px;"" /></p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>The build is separated into three parts: the top, the bottom&nbsp;and the wings. The build is easy and simple, taking no longer than three minutes for the most inexperienced beginner. The top has the engine and the bottom has the cockpit.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834044937_9073a6fa74_o.jpg"" style=""width: 136px; height: 60px;"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49833739021_8056362e8f_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 60px;"" />&nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49833203303_49c72a6926_o.jpg"" style=""width: 74px; height: 60px;"" /></p>

<p>You might have a really good memory and remember the cross technic pin and realise that it isn&#39;t in the pictures. I will come to that. The four&nbsp;wings are really basic and clip onto the modified 2x1 plates.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed Model:</h3>

<p>Let me roll off some pictures first.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49833739176_83a5de50e9_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 85px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834044682_b53df9c0c2_o.jpg"" style=""width: 65px; height: 85px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49833739301_f0aa69fbf1_o.jpg"" style=""width: 107px; height: 85px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49834045342_3ef6d33972_o.jpg"" style=""width: 129px; height: 85px;"" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would really like to point out at this stage that I really don&#39;t like the structure of this build. You might be thinking &ldquo;Hey! This isn&#39;t right. The structure should come under &#39;The Build!&rdquo;. If you&#39;re thinking that, then you might be right. Here we go back to the pin. Without the pin, this TIE is nothing. It attaches the top section to the bottom section. This means that the studs are both on top and underneath, which is quite nice, apart from the fact that there are no studs sticking the top and the bottom together, leaving ugly gaps in between. The engine is quite nice, with a translucent-red stud at the back. The cockpit isn&#39;t great at all and lacks a lot of detail that definitely could&#39;ve been included. That&#39;s pretty much all there is to it.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion:</h3>

<p>I think this is a terrible poly bag. It is really quick and easy to build, has no playability functions and just really sucks. I&#39;m not even sure that someone who designed the Star Wars Rebels series would be able to recognise this immediately as the &#39;TIE Advanced Prototype&#39;. I think that I had this built for less than 5 minutes; I built it; I took a dozen pictures of it; I put it up against my other microscale TIE models; I took it apart again, realising there was no point in keeping it built and scrapped it for parts. The remainders now sit in an empty hand-cream pot that my mum gave me. I really hope that this review has persuaded you not to open or buy this set.

"Captainfives1514","2023-01-29T19:38:10.993Z","The Inquisitor’s Ship","<p>I got this set at Target back in 2015. The Rebels tv show was just kicking off and Disney had just bought Lucasfilm. It was the last Star Wars set I bought for a long time. At least four years until I started buying them again after they released the Mandolorian AT-ST Raider.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build is actually quite complicated for such a small set. The main body of the Tie is slotted together using technic axle. Once finished it makes a nice little Tie fighter to swoosh around and chase any miniature X-wings you have. The solar wings can fold up almost up against the body of the fighter.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; The price for this poly bag was typical price at that time and was a good value I believe.</p>
