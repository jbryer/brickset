<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing special here except for a couple dark green dustbins and the studless wall elements.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I&#39;m just getting back into LEGO so I&#39;m&nbsp;no expert but I haven&#39;t seen this fig&#39;s head anywhere else yet. &nbsp;He looks tired, like he&#39;s been emptying garbage cans for too many hours :)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>5 minute build, no surprises, no difficulties.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really don&#39;t know why I&#39;m drawn to this set. &nbsp;Maybe because it&#39;s cute and I&#39;m into service vehicles more than regular cars and trucks. &nbsp;The bins are attached with robot arms so they can tilt up and dump trash into the back of the vehicle (imagine a full size garbage truck lifting bins off the street). &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Love it! &nbsp;A $3.50 must have!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A reasonable selection for the size. One SNOT piece only. The dustbins and accessories are nice, although I&#39;m beginning to wish for less green bins (I&#39;d like more grey), as they seem to be all I get these days. The mixed corner wall elements are always useful too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I am not knowledgeable about figure rarity, but he is nice enough, with a detailed front printed torso and a very neat goatee.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As simple as you&#39;d expect, offering no challenge in the few minutes it takes to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I can&#39;t comment on realism directly, but I&#39;ve never seen a vehicle like this. On the other hand, it is a fun little unit, with the 2 bins stuck on the back with a simple mechanism to raise and lower them.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For the price you really can&#39;t go wrong. That this was given out free with a magazine is incredible to me - the overall price is less than I&#39;d pay for even the simplest mini-figure.&nbsp;I bought 2, and don&#39;t regret it, as it is far too much work to keep the streets clean alone!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:43:37.51Z","Not a bad little Polybag.","<p><strong>Set #30313 Garbage Truck:</strong> LEGO City polybags are always guaranteed to give you something to think about, will it be worth picking up or won&rsquo;t it? In the case of this polybag however let&rsquo;s discuss the pros and cons of an interesting idea, that will fit in quite nicely when the new Park set is released later this year.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Garbage Truck model is fast and simple to build, fun to play with for younger builders, and includes two green garbage cans with lids. A great deal for such a small set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Makes a nice companion set to Riding Lawn-mower.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Minifigure is dressed in standard gas station/mechanic outfit complete with unique ball cap with hole for speakers from Airport sets. Generic, but not bad for Minifigure enthusiasts.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model can be a bit small and is more akin to a maintenance truck used in small parks or camp sites rather than a truck large enough to handle garbage. Some may not like this design choice, especially as the &lsquo;truck&rsquo; uses the standard small car/race car body instead of something a bit more fitting for a heavy duty off-road vehicle.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price-per-piece may feel slightly off once model is completed. As a free giveaway it&rsquo;s not terrible, for 6$ CND it can be hard to swallow.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I have mixed feelings on this set honestly, it&rsquo;s a nice pleasant enough model with a decent use for LEGO City fans who look to expand into large City plans and MOCS. It makes a great little vehicle for parks, camping areas or even national parks and schools as a maintenance vehicle often seen in those areas. Unfortunately I do feel that this model is a bit weak because it doesn&rsquo;t look like a truck, or even a small off-road vehicle, it looks more like somebody took a car and modified it into something else. A slightly beefier body build might have benefited here, also adding a few more pieces. This vehicle should not be smaller than a ride-on lawn mower.</p>

<p>Still I do recommend picking a few up if you can, especially if you can get them for a good price. It is a much needed bit of diversity from the LEGO City Polybag standard, it will go great as an extra little maintenance vehicle in the new LEGO City Park set coming out during the summer, and what is there can easily be modified with some interesting MOC ideas to bulk it up and make it even better. A weak mold, but a good deal, pick it up if you can.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard 2015 style polybag. The back has boring stuff, the front shows the guy doing his duty.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good parts selection. I finally have a green trash can! Brooms and shovels are always useful.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get one generic worker in this set. He&#39;s pretty cool, although I imagine his parts are in numerous other sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple and takes around 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks good for a polybag. There isn&#39;t much playability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a good little set. I got it as a gift, but I personally wouldn&#39;t go buy one. It could be useful for MOCs, I suppose.</p>
