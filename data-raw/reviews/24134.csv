<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>2 numbered Instruction books with 3 numbered bags</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A couple of new parts for me. &nbsp;Never sure if they&#39;re new LEGO parts or just new to me. &nbsp;The new alligator is great fun! &nbsp;Nice color, opening mouth and an articulated tail.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Standard fare here. &nbsp;Nice printing but no surprises. 1 police pilot and 1 crook.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy but interesting build, especially the airplane. &nbsp;It is really strong. &nbsp;GREAT design. &nbsp;The only mild disappointment would have to be the wings. &nbsp;They just look a little lacking, but the playability of the plane is very good since it doesn&#39;t easily come apart. &nbsp;The 4x4 truck is built up and I&#39;m really liking vehicles these days due the build. &nbsp;BIG tires on the truck.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Not a challenging build, but that&#39;s not the goal here. &nbsp;This set is designed for play and it excels at that. &nbsp;The alligator is fantastic and the set includes a 2x4 box that &quot;hides&quot; in the swamp. &nbsp;There&#39;s $ and gold hidden inside! &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re into the swamp theme, this works well. &nbsp;I recommend the set for the airplane alone. &nbsp;The truck could work in your own LEGO layout outside of the swamp theme, but it&#39;s big. &nbsp;Fun set.</p>

"Skut","2015-07-20T01:52:46.277Z","Two awesome vehicles for one great play experience","<p>This set is worth getting just for the Police seaplane.&nbsp; The other elements are great too but are really just icing on the cake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First: the seaplane.&nbsp; This is Lego&#39;s best-ever seaplane and is superior even to the flying boat from 5935 Island Hopper way back in 2000.&nbsp; It the antithesis of the &quot;Spruce Moose&quot; disaster that was the 7723 Police Pontoon Plane from 2008.&nbsp; It very successfully evokes the feel of iconic large rotary engined floatplanes like the DHC Beaver or Otter which were (and are) instrumental in reaching remote regions in Canada.&nbsp; Given the fact that the Swamp Police theme necessarily involves remote area policing, this choice of aircraft is an ideal fit for this theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, the inner sides of the floats, and the structure attaching the floats to the fuselage, could be better modelled but TLG has obviously prioritised sturdiness over strict accuracy and the overall result is great.&nbsp; The plane&#39;s lines, proportions&nbsp;and swooshability are absolutely first class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 4x4 &quot;baddie truck&quot; is right up to the high standards TLG has set for this type of vehicle over the past few years.&nbsp; It&#39;s very solidly designed, with the chassis in particular well able to stay together over some serious jumps.&nbsp; The rear tray also comes with a cover, to which are clipped the crooks&#39; tools of trade.&nbsp; These include, somewhat perplexingly, an oar.&nbsp; Perhaps the tray cover is expected to double as a raft, but that crook&#39;s pretty brave if he&#39;s rafting in alligator/crocodile infested swamps!</p>

<p>The new alligator/crocodile is great, with a better articulated tail, wide-opening jaws and great printing.&nbsp; Minifigs are what one would expect (crook and Police pilot) - nothing stand-out in this regard, however the inclusion of the &quot;swag&quot; which the crook can wear round his neck is a good touch.&nbsp; The little hidey-hole for the crook&#39;s loot adds to play value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately the set features the terrible white-printed, short-lifespan stickers.&nbsp; However they will only really detract from the set&#39;s looks when they peel off the seaplane&#39;s tail.&nbsp; Otherwise the stickers are not really essential to the set&#39;s looks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a great set and well worth the money.&nbsp; Enjoy!&nbsp;</p>
