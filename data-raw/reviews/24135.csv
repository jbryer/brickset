<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has a cute &quot;comic&quot; on the back. The instructions were as usual simple.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts for this was rather easy to separate, however there were alot more tiny pieces than I thought there would be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 mini figures come in the set. The woman has a rather charming bob cut which is pretty fun.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I enjoyed the build. It was interesting to see how they used pieces together to make the lights, I would suggest however putting the table on first and then putting all the pieces on after. I had a hard time getting the table into place with everything on it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There were as usual a few pieces left over. I had 2 rings left over so I used one to keep in the box and one as a bracelet for her arm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think its a charming set and def a great gift for any Lego fan on Valentines Day or not!</p>

<p>Anyway...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Like every other $10 holiday vignette this set is quite the parts pack. Sand green masonry bricks, sand blue pillar brick-things, fezzes, tan inverted slopes, etc.&nbsp;There is a&nbsp;wide variety of warm, realistic colors which really make the scene pop.</p>

<p>As usual, the ring in this set is accompanied by 2 extras.</p>

<p>The flowers are not the usual flat, rubbery,&nbsp;&quot;4 to a sprue&quot; type, but the hard, plastic&nbsp;kind which have a hole on the bottom for connecting to normal LEGO studs. I have not seen them in this violet color before.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The guy comes in navy suit which I think is relatively uncommon, though unfortunately his face is no doubt well known to collectors of CITY and other &quot;normal&quot; themes. The girl, however, has dark brown hair which I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen at all in any other set; it is at least a very rare color for a common piece. Her torso is new to me as well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Straightforward, straight upward building. Nothing you wouldn&#39;t find in a Creator house or something similar. The curtains were probably the only &quot;special&quot; part of this build.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It is hard to express how much I love this set. I am an avid MOCer and tend to deconstruct sets after a couple months of shelf time to be used in my creations. The fact that even with so many useful parts, this set has kept its place on my shelf, really speaks to its aesthetic quality. I would definitely recommend this set if you can get it between $0-$15; $20 might be a bit much just because it is still a smaller set.</p>

"mr_piggle","2015-02-22T00:51:48.167Z","Charming Vignette","<p>I wasn&#39;t originally going to purchase this set because I had other sets I wanted more,&nbsp;but my love of tiny vignettes won me over.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is colorful and cute, I enjoyed the little picture story on the back of the box. Made the set even more charming. The instructions were quite simple, as expected, because this is a small set. However, they were clever and I will be utilizing some ideas to make my own little scenes from spare parts in the future, I&#39;m sure.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>If you care about that sort of thing, there are some parts that are rare. Personally I&#39;m not a rare part hoarder, but I do appreciate the beauty of something new popping up in a build.&nbsp;There were a few things I hadn&#39;t seen before, things I want to see in similar sets, etc.</p>

<p>Lots of extras which is always nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>They&#39;re pretty cute. Like the girl&#39;s hair, like the guy&#39;s crooked smirk. It all seems to work. I could see customizing the figures to resemble other people.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy and fun. I have a really intense job, and often&nbsp;use Lego as a stress-reliever. Lets me zone out and not think about incidents I encountered at work. This set was perfect for that. Sometimes the small simple sets with really easy steps are really engaging. I know I could&#39;ve thrown this together in 10 minutes, but I took my time, listening to music and really appreciating each step as it came together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very charming. There&#39;s such attention to detail, from the curtain rods down to the chair legs. I love every bit of this set. I&#39;ve even grown to love the ginormous red gift box.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As a collector of the LOTR sets AND someone who&#39;s really into things being to scale, the giant rings always made me a little sad. In this instance, the huge gift and ring feel like they stick out like a sore thumb, and sort of an afterthought... but I remedied it by using the ring as a bracelet on the woman&#39;s arm (as I see another reviewer did as well). I feel like I&#39;m generally the only one really bothered by those things, so that aside, this set is pretty great. Probably doesn&#39;t hold much play value for kids, but I could see myself and my brother having had fun with this when we were younger, bringing in the Police or Fire departments for a restaurant emergency. You never know!</p>

<p>I honestly am excited to see what other seasonal sets come out this year now that I know they&#39;re going to be scenes like this. That&#39;s just the kind of thing I love!</p>
