I got this set for my fifteenth birthday,&nbsp;and it wasn&#39;t my first Lego set or Ninjago set but I like this set so I decided to make a review for it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Ok, so in the instructions, there are two bags of bricks to build. On the front of the box, you can see everything that is included in the set. After you build bag one and then get to the middle to three fourths of bag two, you build the top part with the two awesome swords. On the box they have the swords facing the front and on the instructions, they have you put the swords facing the back of the dojo.</span></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>In this set they give you four minifig swords, (two gold and two silver),&nbsp;to partake in the build for the mini training helper. After that you might notice if you get this set that they give a total of two gold and two silver swords extra so if you have any minifigures without any weapons you can give those to them. There are also two amazing printed frosted window pieces. Finally, another interesting piece is the green part of the Jade Blade. You can hardly tell but these pieces are somewhat transparent.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Ok, let me just say this--the minifigures are AWESOME.</p>

<p>Kai: Kai has the half-mask on his face. I personally don&#39;t like these--they are hard to get on just right. Kai also has some really detailed printing all over.</p>

<p>Karloff: Karloff is a great figure to have. He has huge metal fists so he looks really awesome. Karloff only has printing on the torso.</p>

<p>Griffin Turner: He has a staff for his weapon. He for some reason has an alternate face without the glasses--in the show he never takes them off. He only has printing on the torso as well.</p>

<p>Sleven: Sleven has really good printing all around. He also has a really huge weapon with two blades. He also has a really cool helmet that looks like an Anocondrai&nbsp;skull.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly simple, but a few things surprised me. For a dojo set, I wasn&#39;t expecting flick-fire-missiles. Also, there are studs on the side exposed so Griffin Turner can run up the walls.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks pretty good. I really like the spinning mini dojo training helper. You can spin it really well. You also can do quite a bit like battling other Elemental Masters and have the loser fall down the trap door.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All in all, I think this is a really good set. You get two exclusive figures-Griffin Turner and Karloff. You can train your figures to fight in the tournament. Finally, you can take off the training helper for a wider training area. Also, if you get this set you can display it and this will look really good.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">You might think that ninjas can&rsquo;t get any more exciting. Think again. This set puts the Ninjago ninjas into a game show of sorts. The question of stability lies in doubt, though.&nbsp;</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">Minifigures</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">Kai is aptly robed for his jungle environment. He has no sleeves and I think that suits him well. The leg, hip, and torso printing flow together nicely. The compact half-mask is also notably detailed. The determined expression behind needs no additions. However, Kai&rsquo;s spiked, spectacle of a hairpiece lacks only in the length of the rear strands. I am very pleased with him.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">The same can also be said for Griffin Turner. Although he has no leg printing, I find his attire realistic. The solid white uniform contrasts boldly with the red belt, reminding us of the bold personality behind the red tinted sunglasses and white smile. The back of his head shows a plain, but invigorating face of angered eyes and clenched teeth. His last part, a brown, combed-back hairstyle, seems believable for such a character.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">Karloff, likewise, has a quite irate face and features no leg printing. His torso isn&rsquo;t as powerful as his predecessor, but fits entirely. He comes with the standard Ninjago samurai helmet, as well as shoulder armor. Though not as colorful as the others, he still stands strong, especially with his metal gauntlets.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">Sleven is the final figure and the least thrilling so far. However, I still welcome his appearance. The pants are striking and are emblazoned with intricacies like his foot printing. The bare, tattooed chest is just as wild as possible and can barely prepare us for his head. His revolting expression of hatred is firm and unwavering. The helmet, made from a snake&rsquo;s skeleton&rsquo;s head will prove invaluable for future creations.&nbsp;</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">The Completed Model</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">As the name implies, this is a dojo and a rather sizable one at that considering this set contains a meager two hundred and fifteen pieces. Despite not being a formidable facade, this interior based structure still rises high. I love the color scheme. Little flairs of Asian architecture run along the edge, adding to the grandness. There are swords cleverly integrated into the roof. Also present is competitor banners jutting out from below the arch. Printed rice paper doors bring the final touch to the theme.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">A starkly sculpted jade blade is the prize. Getting it won&rsquo;t be that easy though. Lying on either side of its platform are booby traps. To the left is a drill dummy laden with gold and silver katanas, ready to strike anybody. Afterwards, the contestant must climb a chain to the trophy. To the right are three stools, each successively higher. Don&rsquo;t fall though, sharp spears await your demise. There is also a set of missiles, but I feel they only distract from the build. Even if you have laid claim to the reward, a well integrated play function, the trapdoor with fierce flames below, can be pulled to your downfall, literally! The opportunities for play go on and on, but as for strength of construction . . . I can firmly say that this building could have been better and could have been worse. However, for the size of the set, I will not complain.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">Overall</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-203c82a9-7fff-fa97-04e7-61d047c888ff"">The selection of competitors and surprisingly lengthy layout make this set advantageous to anybody. Its only shortcoming is display value. Thankfully, the imagination needs nothing else.</b></p>
