<p>Build:&nbsp;This is the absolute strength of the set. The use of classic washing machine pieces together with the new 4x1 plate/tile (with studs on the extremities and tiled in the centre) allows the build to obtain a very pleasing near-oval appearance. I love it when new parts are seamlessly used with older ones to obtain such pleasing results.</p>

<p>Gripe: The yellow plates do not work well to the colour scheme of the car; another green would have been more appropriate.</p>

<p>Overall : 4/5. Seemed to be very popular as part of the WHS / Daily Mail promotion on 17/5/2015, with about 10 other people waiting with their newspapers to get theirs just after the store opened on Sunday!</p>

"Shib","2015-05-18T14:26:11.333Z","Small, But Surprisingly Satisfying","<p>As a big fan of DC comics I love the opportunity to expand the DC Comics Superheroes theme at any chance. For those of us in the UK this polybag was available with the Daily Mail on Sunday 17th May 2015, meaning I was able to get it for the price of a paper (&pound;1.60) - definitely a bargain price!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The artwork on the bag shows very clearly this falls under the DC Superheroes branding, and includes a Batman logo for a little additional sub branding - the Joker does occasionally appear in other sections of DC&#39;s universe but really is a Batman villain so this makes sense. I often feel like LEGO&#39;s photos on packaging don&#39;t really show their sets in the best way, but this photo does give a very fair indication of the size and contents of the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>If you like having lots of rare and unusual parts in those difficult to find colours be prepared to be disappointed. While I do like rare parts I think this set is actually elevated by having fairly common parts as it makes it easier for people to build more, let&#39;s be fair one bumper car on it&#39;s own is fairly unusual. Personally I intend to build several in different colours for other DC minifigures, but I can imagine a lot of people using several of these as a way to build a bumper car ride to go with the current <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10247-1/Ferris-Wheel"">Ferris Wheel </a>and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10244-1/Fairground-Mixer"">Mixer</a> sets.</p>

<p>In terms of rare parts the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6058966"">spoiler&nbsp;</a>is probably the rarest part, having been introduced in 2014 and appeared in only 8 sets so far, but as it is relatively new and fairly useful on vehicle designs I think they will become more and more common. Also it would be fairly easy to substitute this section for a slightly different build technique if needed.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The polybag comes with just one minifigure, The Joker. This is the forth appearance of this version of the Joker - having been the standard style for him since 2012. This means that he&#39;s not exactly hard to get hold of elsewhere, but a cheap way to get any main character is always a positive in my book.</p>

<p>To be fair the print on the torso is very detailed so I don&#39;t blame LEGO for reusing the minifigure, after all if it isn&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it. The one thing that could make it better would be a bit of print on the legs for a bit of extra detail, but that&#39;s just me looking for faults.</p>

<p>I do also like that the designers have armed him with a pie. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4622092"">pie part</a> is one that I quite like anyway, but having this as a weapon instead of a gun makes this set a bit more child friendly, but to the adult DC fans who know how sinister the Joker can be, we can still imagine the contents of the pie to be far worse than it appears.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I was very impressed with the build, for such a small set it uses a couple of clever techniques that are not too chalanging to make it difficult for children to build, but give a great finished look and mean the build is more involved than just straight stacking of bricks.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Instantly recognisable as a bumper car so definitely mission accomplished for the designers. I really like it, it&#39;s not a massive and impressive set, but it&#39;s a fun little piece that wouldn&#39;t look out of play in a toy room or on a work desk. The only part of the finish I&#39;m not partial to are the two uncovered studs at the front of the model, I might cover those with some single stud plates or cheese slopes on mine, so easily fixed.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great little set, well worth picking one up if you can, although I wouldn&#39;t pay through the nose to get one, if you already have a good selection of parts you could probably build one (or at least something similar) without much cost.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T21:32:45.17Z","Funland Expansion Polybag","<p><strong>Set #30303 Joker&rsquo;s Bumper Car: </strong>This DC Super Heroes polybag is an interesting companion to the Jokerland set released this year. It is also a fun looking set and would have made an excellent army builder for Joker Henchmen if LEGO had chosen that Minifigure over the Joker himself. Still it&rsquo;s a great little Polybag, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Bumper Car model build is fantastically creative and stands out quite nicely as a fun little model.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>SNOT building techniques used with only a pair of studs still visible once all is said and done.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Joker Minifigure adds a suitable hint of menace to the set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Fun to play with, will definitely want multiples of the model for Joker themed amusement park ride, or just regular amusement park ride.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Joker not unique to this set, printing and parts reused from other sets.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Pie accessory fits Joker&rsquo;s personality, but would have preferred something more sinister such as a laughing gas canister.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Visible studs on front of model detract from the look slightly.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This little polybag is a real gem, you&rsquo;ll definitely want more than one of them or to MOC your own using differently coloured pieces once you have the instructions. The Bumper Car model looks great and fits in well with Jokerland or The Dynamic Duo Funhouse Escape. Highly recommended.</p>

"AranLewis","2015-11-28T19:55:07.96Z","BANGG!!!","<p>From the first time I saw leaked photos of this set on YouTube I was convinced on its&#39; quality asa polybag.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions are short and simple to follow however the build is surprisingly satisfying.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces are nice, the cheese slopes fairly rare in these colours but the main draw f the set would be the Joker and the creampie.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Great joker fig, nothing too innovative but ny time we get a Joker ina&nbsp; set it is a good day. Great pie&nbsp;accessory as well, very fitting to the set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Although small and not including any really rare pieces (maybe with the exception&nbsp;of the spoiler&nbsp;&amp; there are a few that come in quite unique colours) it is a great use of these pieces and it is certainly a set that you would acquire to build and display rather than to&nbsp;recycle the partss into building anything else.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great model of a bumper car and probably the first Lego bumper car ever, multiples would be great for fairground MOCs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great little set, maybe even the best polybag of the year (2015 UK). Hard to give an opinion on price as this is free with a 60p newspaper in England so in my opinion it&#39;s probably the best value set I have.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The polybag is simple same as the instructions</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces you get in this set are rare but also quite useful in any LEGO MOC.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Joker, the only minifigure in this set looks good. Nothing special.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set is very simple, it only has 47 pieces.</p>

<p>The bumper car itself is a great little mini build. I think you can use it anywhere - on your shelf or in MOCs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great tiny set for every LEGO collector. I like all the pieces and the minifigure is great. The set is very cheap so a big thumbs up!</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-05-13T12:29:10.383Z","One of the best Superheroes polybags ever","<p>The Joker is possibly DC&#39;s most renowned supervillain ever. The story of The Joker originated at around the time of the Second World War, when artists started designing comic strips and the like. The Joker first appeared on screen in 1989 when he featured in &#39;Batman&#39;. Ever since, The Joker has been&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with The Batman and as his arch-nemesis. The Joker is mostly found committing preposterous crimes on television, but the DC LEGO licence&nbsp;has taken a different approach to the villain and the hero, usually using them as a subject of comedy. This can be proven throughout The LEGO Batman Movie and occasionally in the LEGO Movies 1 and 2. This gives a nice appeal to younger audiences and encourages older fans to understand that having LEGO as a hobby is supposed to be fun rather than stressful. This polybag is a fine example to that fact.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am sorry if I get some facts wrong because I haven&#39;t watched many of the DC films, being mostly underage and I&#39;m also more of a Marvel fan when it comes to films (I can&#39;t believe that I just said that on a DC review!).&nbsp;Without further ado, I shall begin my sixth picture review! I apologise about the black-on-black photo situation.</p>

<h3>History:</h3>

<p>This is a new part of the review which I have edited in. I would like to give a big shout out to covfefe2020, who put me on the trail. The Joker Bumper Car actually features in a minor part of the LEGO Batman 3: Beyond Gotham video game. It appears in the Same-Bat time, Same Bat-Channel part of the story line, in Area 3. You can use this link to see it in action:&nbsp;https://youtu.be/iTu1MaSUVgw?t=1076. Once again, a huge thank you to covfefe2020!</p>

<h3>Availability:</h3>

<p>This set was part of a partnership between The LEGO Group and&nbsp;The Daily Mail&nbsp;newspaper in the UK and was available with a copy of the newspaper in May of 2015. Furthermore, you could purchase this set in the US, but only in Toys R Us in December 2014 and July 2015, so you have to have had a keen eye to find this set.</p>

<h3>Packaging/Instructions:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set comes as a polybag, which I no longer have for photography purposes. However, the main Brickset photo is basically the whole of the polybag. It comes with a small, double-sided instructions leaflet with easy-to-follow steps. There are 9 steps in total.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49883795026_c087cb80b5_b.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 135px;"" /></p>

<h3>Parts:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The build uses 47 pieces, but you get 1 spare translucent-yellow stud, bringing the total up to 48. The pieces to note contain the minifigure pieces which I will go over in the Minifigure section (the legs are not rare), the black headrest which comes in 30 sets, the blue 1x1 plate with clip, the 1x1x8 light-grey antenna piece that appears in 21 sets&nbsp;and the pie which The Joker holds, which comes in only 13 sets, making it the rarest piece in the set besides the minifigure parts. However, the pie,&nbsp;disappointingly enough, has a noticeable circular indent near the middle, which marks the set down a little bit. The colour scheme is very nice and bright, which is a nice change from the darker colours of Star Wars.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49884103992_3325f7c2dd_b.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 68px;"" /></p>

<h3>The Minifigure:</h3>

<p>The polybag includes one minifig which is The Joker. This variant of The Joker is very nice but in no way exclusive. He appears in 3 other sets, one being a Juniors set. The only reason why he&#39;s not more common is the fact that he has a lime jacket behind the purple blazer, instead of a darker colour, which has included dark green and grey. Let me show some pictures and then I&#39;ll go through the monstrosity; from head to toe.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src="" https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49884103927_3c1dc433b0_b.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 134px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49883269848_4de1fc5dd9_b.jpg"" style=""width: 108px; height: 134px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49883269798_e96eab3f7a_b.jpg"" style=""width: 105px; height: 134px;"" /></p>

<p>His hair is green, in the same style as Grand Moff Tarkin&#39;s, which suits the character especially well. It shows a large area of the character&#39;s forehead, which is sometimes covered by a longer hair piece. At the back, the hair goes low enough to cover another expression fully.&nbsp;The hairpiece comes in 11 sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m really sorry but I forgot to take pictures of the other facial expression, so that&#39;s on me.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>The head is a basic white with a curling smile smothered in red lipstick. You can see the creases in his face from when he has smiled or laughed too much. His brow is furrowed and his eyebrows are green. The eyes are really menacing. On the alternate face, the face is pretty similar apart from a big grin, to make it look like The Joker is laughing.</p>

<p>The torso features a purple blazer over a lime jacket with his iconic flower that puts people to sleep. He has a dark green bow and white hands, which matches with his face. On the back, he has a small crease on the blazer and a small buckle. The torso comes in 4 sets, making it the rarest part in the set and the rarest used in the minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, LEGO decided to give The Joker plain purple legs to match the blazer. There&#39;s nothing special about these at all and they appear in 69 sets.</p>

<p>The pie fits very nicely in The Joker&#39;s hand.</p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>The build is very quick, taking a maximum of 3&nbsp;minutes. It also incorporates a minor SNOT technique for the base. It is split into 2 parts: the top and the bottom.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49883269533_6f678a1ac3_b.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 142px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49884103772_3dcd060ab7_b.jpg"" style=""width: 147px; height: 142px;"" /></p>

<h3>The Completed Model:</h3>

<p>Let me roll off some pictures.</p>

<p>As you can see, the underside is reasonably colourful, with the mixed shades of black, red and yellow. The underside could be interpreted as the Belgian or German flag, which might be a little Easter Egg depending on who designed it (that&#39;s your lockdown homework). The wheels lack tyres in the set, but that gives it less friction when rolling on hard or fabric surfaces. However, with only two wheels, this does make the bumper car slightly un steady and it either drops forward or back. The colour scheme in the whole build is fantastic. Lime green represents The Joker&#39;s love of drastic colours and the black on the bottom is traditional to bumper cars. The antenna on the back looks excellent and provides a mean to locate&nbsp;other (imaginary) bumper cars. The Joker sits perfectly in the middle and can be leant back. When standing, the minifig comes to the height of the headrest.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This Bumper Car is incredible. I love the colour scheme which relates to the minifig. The minifig itself is fantastic minus the plain legs. The parts are reasonably rare and are a nice selection. The model glides on almost every object and, whilst the playability isn&#39;t necessarily present, it attracts kids due to the wacky and fun ideas. At the same time, it makes for an excellent display&nbsp;model for older fans. The only problem I can find with the set is that it is a bit top- or back-heavy.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can still find this on EBay or Bricklink or any other LEGO sites, I recommend buying it instantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I hope the review was helpful. Look out for more picture reviews from me coming soon!</p>
