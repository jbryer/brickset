"ModularRoger","2015-06-09T21:49:21.127Z","Fantastic Little City/Space Set","<p>When the 2015 City Spaceport sets were revealed, this is the one that caught my eye. I already have 3367 and 3368 (the Space Shuttle and Space Centre, respectively) from the 2011 line and am not looking to add more large spacecraft, but I am always interested in picking up more astronauts and &quot;tech accessories&quot; for my personal space program.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is probably a bit bigger than necessary (about 5x6 inches) and the booklet&nbsp;feels thick for such a small set, but I suppose that the latter speaks to the quality and user-friendliness of the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A very good variety of small parts in various colors, without too much redundancy. These 107 pieces really count. Three printed pieces are included--a 2x2 monitor screen, a 1x2 keyboard and a 1x2 &quot;blinking light panel.&quot; No stickers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two astronauts are identical except for their faces (one has a smirk) and a single blue hat that they can&#39;t both wear. The combined helmet-backpacks seem to be the same as those in the 2011 sets, and offer great functionality with the ability to stand upright securely on a studded surface, and the small over-the-shoulder &quot;side lamp&quot; construct on one of them&nbsp;is superb looking in its clean simplicity.&nbsp;The front/back torso printing is very attractive with prominent metallic silver and red/blue accents. I really like the City Spaceport logo, which also appears on the back of the female scientist&#39;s lab coat. The fourth figure, the engineer, looks as though&nbsp;he could be in any construction or industrial set, but is solid nonetheless. The legs are the only things disappointing about these minifigures, as none of them have any printing.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The buggy/rover vehicle is very small and simple, but still an enjoyable build. I find the color scheme to be extremely attractive, the white, grey, red and blue very crisp and clean, with some transparent light blue&nbsp;and a single gold cone. It looks good coming together. There are plenty of small playability features and places to attach accessories. An&nbsp;excellent small design. The rest of the construction is similarly simple,&nbsp;straightforward and easy.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>Again, the buggy is very sharp. The small science/computer station also looks great, and has some synergy with the laboratory-esque&nbsp;Ideas sets that have been very popular recently. There is an attached &quot;rock formation&quot; for lack of a better way to describe it, which seems to function as a small off-road simulation zone for the buggy. It reminds me of an artificial hill in the parking lot of a Land Rover dealership. Kind of an unexpected detail in a set of this scale, but I like it. The final two items, a camera and a light array on separate 4x4 plates, are very minimalist but&nbsp;make perfect sense in this context.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>Brick-for-brick,&nbsp;this may be the single most rewarding set that I have come across. At 107 pieces and $10 in the US, it is very small and inexpensive, but there are no wasted parts or uninspired details. Whether one sees&nbsp;it as equipment used in a testing facility on Earth, or in the field&nbsp;on another planet or moon, the playability potential is utterly fantastic, and it doesn&#39;t look bad for display purposes either. A great way to pick up some gold-visored astronauts, for sure, but a great supplement as a whole for any space or science-themed repertoire. Maximum value, maximum recommendation.</p>

"melvlee","2015-06-20T06:28:42.513Z","Some nice parts but limited playability; the Rover seems to miss the point.","<p>I&#39;ve not bought any Space-type sets since the Discovery series of 2003, not because I don&#39;t want to but mainly because the recent sets look too juniorised and just not too appealling to me. I feel that all the recent Space Shuttle and space sets in general have an over-sized baby-toy feel to them.</p>

<p>Anyway, I bought this one to test the waters of the new Space series and also for some of the special parts available relatively cheaply in a small set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box doesn&#39;t really scream out &quot;Space&quot; to me. The background as well as the mini-fig in the white hardhat looks like he accidentally walked out of a Town construction set. Without reading the description on Lego&#39;s website, it doesn&#39;t immediately jump out at you that this is supposed to be a space testing lab.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A few nice parts; the female scientist minifig; also the computer screen &amp; keyboard which you would usually need to buy a much larger town set to obtain. The handrail in white colour (which I usually associate with old 9V train sets in black colour) is quite rare and nice to have and can be used for other lab-type creations. Too bad there&#39;s not 2 of them. The special &quot;mars terrain&quot; piece is found in only a few sets but it&#39;s a bit superfluous; only one number doesn&#39;t really make much of a test terrain for the mars rover. It would have been nicer to have a slightly larger baseplate and use more standard parts to create the terrian for the rover to really drive across.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Nice to be able to get the Female Scientist without buying the big Spaceport set 60080.</p>

<p>The &quot;Engineer&quot; in the white hardhat and construction clothes looks out of place. Something like a lab coat or jumpsuit would have been nicer.</p>

<p>The Spacemen are okay and the little camera/light on the side of the visor is a nice touch, but the un-flippable golden visor is a great annoyance that makes the spacemen &quot;emotionless&quot;.&nbsp; Even if the visor can&#39;t move, I&#39;d prefer it to be transparent. It would be nice if the jetpack didn&#39;t need to be gripped by both hands all the time. I also don&#39;t like that the huge headpiece covers up most of the torso spacesuit printing.</p>

<p>And the new Space Logo is weird; why is the little shuttle pointing downward!? It should be going across and up, right!?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple as you would expect in a Starter set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The playability is very limited in my opinion.</p>

<p>The Mars Rover is disappointing; it looks like a beach buggy. I wish they would have given it a robotic arm for collecting soil samples. And a solar panel and upward pivoting antenna/transmitter would have improved it vastly. The ground scanner could have extended out further from the buggy. And maybe 6 wheels instead of 4 to emphasize the rover aspect.</p>

<p>As I mentioned the testing terrain is way too small. If you try to drive the rover over it, you end up pushing the whole testing station away!</p>

<p>The totem mounted lights and camera are nice little touches.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Okay it&#39;s a Starter Set and I really like that Lego have started putting out these small affordable sets again (when I was a kid in the 70&#39;s and early 80&#39;s, tiny sets were all that I could afford to buy with my pocket money) but I feel a few changes could have improved this set vastly. The testing and exploration aspects could have been much better, especially the rover vehicle. Good only for a few parts.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The front image of the box looks a little cluttered, and I&#39;m not a fan of the photoshopping of the buggy on top of the rocks.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A variety of nice pieces here. I&#39;m always grateful for cameras and the printed computer tiles. I can&#39;t get enough of the transparent blue cylinders either. This is also my first encounter with the dark sand rock detail, which is nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Obviously the spaceman and the female scientist are the standouts here. I love that the scientist has glasses - not nearly enough minifigs have them IMO. The other heads are all very basic, although naturally the spaceman&#39;s is hidden. My only complaint about the spaceman is the accessory stuck to the packpack, I just feel they could have done something a tiny bit more interesting.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are 4 sub-builds, none of which are taxing nor involve anything other than the most basic of techniques. It takes 5 minutes tops.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Most of the mini-builds are decent little things. In particular the bank of scientific equipment is great. I&#39;m not a fan of the buggy, but that is more down to the fact that I have a lot of similar ones from the City line. At least in this case, this type of buggy is justified. The rock detailing is a bit strange to me. I feel it would have made more sense to either use 2 of the detailed pieces, or none. This would make the design a little more consistant.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set with a lot of playability due to the various separate builds. The minifigures&nbsp;are great too.</p>
