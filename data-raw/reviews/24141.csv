<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Very straight forward! It was very easy to put together, but at the same time not remedial. The age point was spot on and I&#39;m definitely not taking this one apart.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Very interesting parts in this set, I&#39;m undecided whether or not the front end should have been the solid&nbsp;piece it was or if it would have been better as an actual part you build yourself. I&#39;m super stoked to have the part seeing as how unique it is, but there&#39;s not a whole lot of rebuilding you can do with it; it&#39;ll pretty much work with this set and not much else.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>YES. Love the fact that there was specifically a female minifigure included as well as the male.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Again, building it was very straight forward, you could see the point of each piece that you were putting on. The inside is small but fits the satellite&nbsp;perfectly. The front end comes off pretty easily but I suppose that&#39;s the point since you will be opening it quite frequently if it&#39;s being used for actual play. The actual frame of the shuttle itself is very sturdy and unlike the usual spaceships where you touch it and it bursts, this thing will actually withstand you holding it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Fantastic, the stickers are perfect and not over the top, the design is very close to an actual shuttle (with some liberties granted). The satellite is super simple and very easy and the stickers make it perfect.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I absolutely love this set, the only thing I have that I&#39;m not a fan of is the price point. There&#39;s not a whole lot of pieces and building for $30 but I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s a little more seeing as how there&#39;s a lot of uncommon pieces. All in all, I love this set to bits and I&#39;m definitely not disappointed.</p>

"CherryRose","2015-10-10T23:12:23.6Z","A trip to Space on a Budget? Why hasn't NASA thought of this!?","<p>Are you or your kid really interested in the Outerspace? Do you dream of walking on the moon someday? Do you want to avoid paying the ridiculous price of the larger 60080? If these are true, this should easily be up your alley!</p>

<h3>As a Playset</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t think any kid in the past few decades hasn&#39;t expressed interest in outer-space some time in their life, whether it&#39;s all about flying around in an airtight suit or flying around in the Millennium Falcon. And this set offers a comically stumpy space shuttle for all your extraterrestrial needs. It&#39;s incredibly sturdy and easy to grab so you can reenact ignition and orbiting, and once you&#39;re up there, just open the bay doors, and there&#39;s a brand-new satellite to deploy! But wait, is it broken I see? Never fear, it includes studs on the back end and a wrench so your astronaut can repair it in a jiffy! Your 2 astronauts are on your way to Mars from there!</p>

<h3>As a Display Model</h3>

<p>While &quot;Comically Squat&quot; is great for play value, this set isn&#39;t much of a joy to behold. It&#39;s really smooth and aerodynamic, but it&#39;s very stubby wings and squat fuselage makes it almost impossible to take seriously, and it&#39;s lack of landing gear, a candid arm or believable ailerons doesn&#39;t help with it&#39;s lack of customizability. (oddly enough, the interior is more complete than it&#39;s larger cousin...)</p>

<h3>As a Building Experience</h3>

<p>Maybe it looks almost the same as the larger shuttle from the outside, but I can assure you the build is significantly different. Sure, it&#39;s juniorized. A lot. Like, heavily. If anything, though, it keeps it lightweight and simple, because as I said earlier, this is designed mainly for a budget, and you&#39;re crazy if you expect complexity from a City set.</p>

<h3>As a Parts Pack</h3>

<p>As with plane sets in the past, plenty of large parts are included in the set, and it&#39;s straightforward in how it uses them. There&#39;s large wedge elements for the wings, arches to give it curvature, and underneath that sea of white are random colors to make it easy to source. However, I will give it credit for two noteworthy parts, the bay doors and the front canopy. I&#39;m sure the former will have plenty of uses, and while the latter is inexplicably POOP, it looks great and gives the plane an excellent and realistic shape.</p>

<h3>Overall Value</h3>

<p>Looking at it objectively, as a toy, it&#39;s a good set overall. It&#39;s a great way to give a young kid something really fun and playable, offering nearly as much relative to the larger set with quests to the world, while not wringing the money out of a paycheck.</p>

<p>Even if it&#39;s not my cup of tea, it gets a thumbs up from me.</p>

"mini_mads1980","2016-06-27T10:39:07.297Z","Compact Shuttle","<p>I seem to have two of these.&nbsp; I remember buying the second one&nbsp;at Tesco on my way to Andover as it was reduced - I then got home to find I already had one in my cupboard of unopened sets!&nbsp; As I already have a few space sets with shuttles I was never in any rush to put this together.&nbsp; My son saw it last week and&nbsp;asked me to build it, so I did.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty much standard for this price point from the City ranges.&nbsp; You get a nice&nbsp;large image of the set on the front, showing the shuttle, satellite and Minifigures.&nbsp; On the back the Hey! image is an astronaut and there are four other images that show the shuttle leaving earth and setting up a satellite.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get one 80-page instruction book in the set, with building instructions from pages 4 to 73.&nbsp; You get three pages of other sets to dream of at the back - Swamp Police, Divers and Space.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get the parts you would expect from this type of set - a couple of large wedge plates for wings, a single nose piece and tail elements.&nbsp; I never apply stickers, but you do get 10 in this set on one sheet.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>What is great here is that nowhere on the box does it show you get both male and female Minifigures in this set.&nbsp; Both have the same torso and leg elements.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I appreciate that this build is for ages 5-12, but so many of the steps are just one or two elements to add to the model.&nbsp; You do fly through the build - even with a two-year-old putting the pieces in the wrong places!&nbsp; There is nothing surprising here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>On the box this looks OK, however the completed build is disappointing.&nbsp; This is due to the length of the set.&nbsp; The cargo door is only four studs long.&nbsp; On other shuttle sets it is longer, but this does not stop both the Minifigues and the satellite fitting in the completed model.</p>

<p>The element that you don&#39;t see on the images though is the lack of undercarriage.&nbsp; There is no way this thing can land back on earth and with no space station for it to dock with I think it loses some of it&#39;s playability.&nbsp; It is very swooshable and my son has spent ages playing with it, but the lack of wheels is a shame.</p>

<p>The blue used at the back to angle the tail elements is poor and white would have been much better.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is OK for the price, but if the length was improved it would be a much better set.&nbsp; Also the lack of wheels is a negative.&nbsp; However, the set gets an overall of&nbsp;four out of five as it is a solid build that holds two Minifigures and a satellite which allows&nbsp;for great play.</p>

<p>My favourite shuttle for playability is still 6346 which I played with for hours when younger and need to dig back out,&nbsp;with 3367 probably a better size of the more recent ones.&nbsp; If you want the best shuttle from recent releases though you will need to go for 60080 - the Spaceport.</p>

"MEWintle","2016-07-25T19:03:53.18Z","Great kit that is fun to play with and very similar to the real X-37","<p>I&#39;m an adult space geek that built a <em>lot </em>of Lego in the 70s. This kit was a gift, and my first modern set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box does a good job showing the kit. The way it shows the two astronauts servicing the satellite in micro-gravity is exactly how most people will play with it! It would be nice if it showed that the astronauts are male and female to encourage girls to get excited about being represented.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Modern Lego sets have a lot of specific parts. This was hard for me to swallow at first. But once I got over my &quot;when I was a kid&quot; attitude, I really enjoyed that the specific parts did a great job of making a fun kit, but there were still lots of general-purpose parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The helmet detail is great, especially the ability to remove the visors. The backpack is cool and the way the seated minifig fits in the shuttle. The wrench adds a lot to the play fun.There&#39;s a lot of things to do with the minifigs and places to attach them. Fantastic for imaginative play.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very straightforward stock build. The instructions are super step-by-step, which is nice for smaller children.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#39;t happy with some of the details. I understand this is a fanciful &quot;Utility Shuttle,&quot; not the actual (retired) NASA shuttle. It&#39;s much more similar to a manned X-37 than a shuttle. But the v-twin tails (totally faithful to the X-37) still bothered me. So, I was super-super excited that I was able to modify the kit so that it had one tail. I wasn&#39;t happy with the folding wings, so I made them static and moved them up so they matched the rest. I ended up with two spare rails, and I was thrilled to realize that they fit perfectly where the v-wings had been. Now they looks like OMS pods alongside the main engines! It makes the kit look much better. My last modification was the stickers. I didn&#39;t use the agency roundels, but I did like the look of the fuel filler(?) ports on the wing. I moved one of the side and now I had the prominent left-hand crew entry door. It looks almost perfect!<br />
<br />
One of the things I love about Lego is the ability to creatively, easily, and non-permanently modify the kits. I had thought that part was no longer true, but this kit proved me wrong. It&#39;s a lot of fun to modify and rearrange.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I totally agree with other reviewers that the kit would have been much improved with a rudimentary landing gear. The purpose of a winged shuttle is so it can land like an airplane. That&#39;s a lot of the fun of playing with one. Lego, unlike a metal or plastic model, makes &quot;retracting&quot; the landing gear as simple as unsnapping it for &quot;on orbit&quot; play.<br />
<br />
That said, the kit looks great. I quickly got over being bothered by its &quot;squat&quot; dimensions. After all, it&#39;s not the full-size shuttle. This is a speculative 2-person shuttle for working with a single small satellite. It&#39;s not designed to bring large Space Station sections for construction, like the big one. Not to beat a dead horse, but this kit is really close to being a manned X-37.</p>


<p>Above is the X-37 (b). You can see the v-tail, the &quot;squat&quot; dimensions, and the scale relative to people. You can even see that cockpit windows are covered over on the real one. This spacecraft looks a *lot* like the &quot;Utility Shuttle&quot; Lego kit</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this kit. I keep it next to &quot;my spot&quot; on the couch. I like to fiddle with it while watching TV. Mostly I take it apart and put it back together again, enjoying the fit and the details a lot. It&#39;s much more rugged than my other shuttle models and has a lot more stuff to &quot;play&quot; with. Mine gets played with many times a week. Highly recommended for kids as well as adults who love spaceflight and want to play with a (somewhat) realistic model without worrying about breaking it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
