<p>Lego hasn&#39;t released many small jets in the City (or, for that matter, Town) lines over the years - fans have mostly had to make do with airliners or cargo aricraft.&nbsp; Even the occasional smaller jets (for example the cargo plane in 6377 Cargo Center or the Police jet in 6344 Jet Speed Justice) have featured podded engines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set provides a new development for Lego - a fighter-like craft with an internal jet engine whose role could be Shuttle pilot training (as the set name suggests), or a chase plane, or both.&nbsp; The overall concept of the set evokes a T-38 as flown by NASA.&nbsp; None of Lego&#39;s previous Spaceport subthemes (Town or City) has used this exact set concept before, so it&#39;s good to see Lego trying something new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, that&#39;s the concept of the set.&nbsp; Does it work in practice?&nbsp; YES is the resounding answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, the plane - overall an impressive effort, with innovative use of parts particularly at the rear of the aircraft.&nbsp; The folding wings are a necessity for road transportation of the jet and give a bit of an aircraft carrier feel, plus added playability.&nbsp; The landing gear is, like all Lego City aircraft since 1985, fixed and therefore must be removed and stored separately if you want to swoosh the plane around in &quot;wheels up&quot; mode.&nbsp; In looks the plane is pretty close to a Folland Gnat (the plane from Hot Shots!) except for the low wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not perfect - the nose section feels unfinished and I can&#39;t for the life of me work out why a 2x2 plate was used in front of the canopy rather than a 2x2 tile.&nbsp; The pilot also lacks a joystick which, given the tiny cost of adding a 1x1 aerial to the parts count, is a lapse.</p>

<p>The truck (semi trailer) is the&nbsp;good effort we have come to expect from TLG over recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The prime mover looks appropriately powerful, and the trailer&nbsp;makes clever use of the low-slung railway chassis which goes way back to the days of 9V trains like the Metroliner.&nbsp; The&nbsp;(relatively) recent move to 6 wide vehicles has given Lego good reason to employ this element on road vehicles and it&#39;s used to good effect here, and is well proportioned with the rest of the rig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the little &quot;Follow Me&quot; vehicle is a nice touch and definitely adds to play value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no obvious mechanism to roll the plane on of off the truck, so your spaceport will need some sort of crane to achieve this.&nbsp; I doubt the truck could drive fast enough for the plane to be flown off (or landed on) the trailer, but then again in the world of kids&#39; imaginations anything is possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs (3) are a bit &quot;meh&quot; collectability-wise but are definitely appropriate to the set.&nbsp; The astronaut/pilot is the only minifig in the Spaceport sets to come with a motorbike/pilot helmet (as opposed to an astronaut&#39;s EVA helmet), which does offer a tiny bit of uniqueness to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, in conclusion,&nbsp;a very solid set in a solid subtheme (Spaceport) and sure to be a&nbsp;winner with the kids.&nbsp;</p>
