"Nouri","2015-12-27T02:40:42.543Z","A Space Lovers Dream (and Budget Breaker)!","<p>As an avid lover of space I found this set to be both very entertaining and awe-inspiring. I bought this set on my way home from the NASA Kennedy Space Center (Located in Cape Canaveral, Florida) so you can imagine how excited I was to have my own miniature versions of the shuttles I saw on display there!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Box is fairly large although more on the skinny side for a set of its price. For comparison, the LEGO Police Station Set&nbsp;(<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60047-1/Police-Station"">http://brickset.com/sets/60047-1/Police-Station</a>) box is almost double the width of the Space Shuttle box. The instructions are fairly straightforward&nbsp;and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>At around 600 pieces and $120 this set has <strong>a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;</strong>of large pieces ranging in size from large to small. You get a good amount of large cylinder shaped pieces as well as the Shuttle bay doors pieces to compliment the rest of the parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>For a set of this magnitude you do not get a large amount of minifigures. At 5 minifigs, 2 of which are practically clones, the minifigure value for this set is not high. However, having the extra astronauts around is always nice and the added addition of the female scientist is a welcome addition to my collection. The 2 other NASA workers are very generic and as such are not worth much at all.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Overall the build was average. Building the Taxi and Launch Pad were amazing fun and a great new experience to learn from.&nbsp;The shuttle was a good build although it&#39;s small size does disappoint as a final product. The Satellite found inside the shuttle while small, is stunningly realistic and a great little build.&nbsp;The rockets while large&nbsp;were very tedious to build and were comprised of mainly stacking large cylinder shaped bricks on top one another.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As a completed model it definitely looks great! My only complaint would have to be it&#39;s small size for such an expensive set as well as the lack of any other defining points in the set other than the Shuttle &amp; Rocket Launch Pad. It does look great as a stand-alone model on a shelf and makes for a very nice scene when coupled with other space elements. The Taxi, Communications Array, and Countdown Sequence all look great when put in a City and coupled with other LEGO elements to compliment them although they can also function stand-alone.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In the end, the shuttle size did disappoint me. For such an expensive set it was much smaller than expected and lacked a lot of key elements of a great LEGO set. If I had to choose again knowing what I was getting I would have most definitely&nbsp;chosen to go with the <em>Utility Shuttle Set</em> (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60078-1/Utility-Shuttle"">http://brickset.com/sets/60078-1/Utility-Shuttle</a>) and the <em>Training Jet Transporter </em>(<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60079-1/Training-Jet-Transporter"">http://brickset.com/sets/60079-1/Training-Jet-Transporter</a>) and still have a little bit of cash left over for other sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a final opinion I would conclude that if you&#39;re a fan of Space or the Space subtheme&nbsp;this is a great set to get just to display or for limited playability. Other than that there&#39;s not really any good reason to get this set.</p>

"Farrealm","2016-01-01T10:07:13.157Z","60080 Spaceport: A nice set but somewhat difficult to play with","<p>My 6-year old son really wanted this set for Xmas. As he had been a good boy all year Santa was more than happy to oblige and the set ended up under the Xmas tree.</p>

<p>He spent most of Xmas-day building the set. There were &lsquo;lots of bags&rsquo; and he was very excited!</p>

<p>From an AFOL perspective the set contains mainly &lsquo;standard&rsquo; Lego bricks with some Technic components. There are quite a few large bricks that make up the shuttle and the &lsquo;rockets&rsquo;. As a result the build may be a bit unsatisfactory with &lsquo;big bricks = quick and simple build&#39;. The &lsquo;rockets&rsquo; are held together by some unusually long&nbsp;Technic axles (26&nbsp;or something)&nbsp;. The sticker sheet is good and is made from some sort of transparent vinyl&nbsp;rather than the standard paper-based stuff.</p>

<p>My son had little problem building the set and only needed a hand with the Technic connecter pegs. He had lots of fun building it and the end result was awesome!</p>

<p>The set has some problems though, which is partly illustrated by the fact that my son hasn&rsquo;t played with it since he build it.</p>

<p>Most importantly the shuttle is connected to the &lsquo;rockets&rsquo; by some sturdy Technic connectors. This seems like a good idea but makes it difficult for my son (or dad&hellip;) to do a &lsquo;smooth&rsquo; launch sequence without &lsquo;stuffing around&rsquo; and accidently breaking the rockets. It&rsquo;s rather frustrating. Also the cargo bay doors and ailerons are not very sturdy and break easily. All in all it&rsquo;s not as &lsquo;playable&rsquo; as you might expect even though there are lots of good elements like the count-down timer.</p>

<p>All-in-all a set of reasonable quality and &lsquo;okay&rsquo; value-for-money. Looks are fantastic but playability is a bit lacking.</p>

<p>ps. AFOL&nbsp;comment... what&#39;s the deal with the gold space helmets and one-piece space suit...!? Can we please have the &#39;old&#39; space helmets back (e.g. Benny)... ;-)</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2017-01-15T00:45:26.263Z","A Great Space Set","<p>I had been looking for a good space shuttle set, complete with both liquid and solid fuel boosters to add to my collection. I thought I missed this set, when I found it at a local game store. I quickly picked it up and put it together.</p>

<p>Please note that I had bought this set after reading many reviews about it mentioning&nbsp;the price, playability, and how quick the build was. Knowing these things, I may have been a little more accepting of the set&#39;s flaws. There aren&#39;t many pieces for the price you pay, causing the build to go faster than another set of the same price point. That being said, you get quite a few large pieces that really help the set stand out as the boosters are made up of half cylinder pieces, cones for the top, as well as some specialty pieces for the shuttle.</p>

<p>The set comes with 5 minifigures, 2 technicians, 1 scientist, and 2 astronauts. There are two extra helmets (not space helmets) provided as well. I appreciate they provided both a male and female astronaut.</p>

<p>The shuttle transporter is fantastic, though simple. I actually think the simplicity of it makes it work as well as it does. It&#39;s a very sturdy build, allowing me to pick up the whole set, with the shuttle and boosters attached, from the base of the transport without worrying about the shuttle falling off. I also like the fact that it hugs the ground as much as it does. This makes it hard to play on carpet, but even a table or bed help it move smoothly along.</p>

<p>The shuttle build looks incredible. The specialty pieces and the colouring of the set really help it stand out. Though they don&#39;t come off effortlessly, the boosters do detach from the shuttle, and also&nbsp;from each other which helps add to the playability. Now, the boosters don&#39;t come off effortlessly, which to me is ideal as I don&#39;t want them falling off every time I go to pick it up. Each booster is held in with two technic attaching pieces which slide out. Sometimes the solid fuel boosters (white) can break when trying to detach it. To get around this, I make sure I handle them around the solid area of the boosters (the shorter areas). When I do this, it doesn&#39;t break. The one drawback I found is with how the boosters attach to the shuttle itself. I find myself thinking I&#39;m going to bust the connector when I go to detach the ball connector at the base.</p>

<p>The shuttle itself is unfortunately a little bare bones inside. It does have the Canada Arm with a small satellite and enough room for both astronauts to fit with their space helmets on, but there&#39;s not much more going on other than one control panel. Still, the overall look of the outside is what matters more to me.</p>

<p>The other elements: the satellite, the countdown timer, and the personnel transporter all work well for what they are, and fit well with the set and definitely add to the playability.</p>

<p>Once again, I&#39;m well aware of other&#39;s negative points, but I don&#39;t regret spending the amount for this set as I now have a pretty incredible looking space shuttle for my minifigs.</p>
