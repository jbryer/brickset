"Shib","2015-06-25T13:43:41.15Z","More Than Meets the Eye","<p>The smallest City sets (in fact a large chunk of the City line) tends to pass me by without much attention, but I was given this set as a little gift and found myself pleasantly surprised. Initially I was just pleased with the addition of a red octopus to my collection, but there&#39;s far more to this set than just an octopus.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a small box with a single instructions booklet. The image on the front of the box does little to really show some of the more interesting parts of the build but does work well enough to show what you get.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is where this set really starts to get interesting, after I&#39;d examined the octopus (in itself a nice part) and located all the minifigure parts my eyes were instantly drawn to the grey jet engine pieces -&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107171"">part number&nbsp;6107171</a>. This is the first set for me to have this part in any colour other than black, but it was probably one of my favourite parts to use as a child (a spaceship might have been made of two of these and a single plate piece with a minifigure sat on&nbsp;top) so seeing them in a new colour in such a low price set, huge plus!</p>

<p>In fact, if you took out the minifigure, octopus and seaweed parts this set could easily be mistaken for a small space set, small curved parts and booster parts as well as some robot arms, I&#39;d certainly consider picking a few up if space builds are your thing!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The single minifigure included is nice enough, while he is obviously a diver, the parts could also easily be repurposed for space suits or even mountain climbing type scenes.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>While I don&#39;t think there are any massive innovations on building techniques I certainly found the build very enjoyable. There are some quite surprising connection methods used on some of the lower parts, that while not challenging or difficult are great to see used to challenge the way you might go about constructing something similar.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While it&#39;s never doing to made a great display piece, it does exactly what it needs to. It looks convincing as a small underwater propulsion unit, has a small piece of scenery and could easily be paired with some of the larger sets in the theme if you did want to try to set up a more impressive display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is one of those sets that&#39;s so swooshable that it is hard to not swoosh it about a little when you pick it up. There aren&#39;t any of the normal flick missile type gimmicks, but the arms have a bit of posability and the rotors on the pack turn so there&#39;s a lot of play value.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very impressed with a set that ultimately I might have only picked up for the octopus piece, moral of the story, size isn&#39;t everything!</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-10-08T03:00:18.637Z","He works with an octopus under the sea...","<p>Hello! I haven&#39;t reviewed anything in a while, so tonight I&#39;m going to do this tiny City set. I know, I&#39;ve done loads of those, but they are easy to review without having to take pictures. *shrug*</p>

<p>Anyway, my brother got this for his 6th birthday and built it very quickly. This is a fun one: small, lots of playability, and a dirt cheap octopus!</p>

<p>The box is very square. To open it, you have to tear it to pieces, but it&#39;s so small it can be stored in a sandwich bag with no problem. It shows everything the set does, which isn&#39;t much. Not a lot of space to fill. They don&#39;t show how swooshable it is, though, which is a pity. I would be more interested if the diver was pointing a speargun at the octopus, but, this is for small children. The contents are two tiny bags, octopus, and one instruction booklet.</p>

<p>The instructions are more or less redundant. The scuba scooter has a very nice parts usage holding up those propellors, although they don&#39;t spin. :( Still, they are much too long for a set with under 50 parts.</p>

<p>The parts are very nice for a $7 set. Aside from the diver, who is just perfect, there&#39;s also some robot arms, seaweed, spearguns, handlebars, miscellaneous vehicle parts that eventually become useful, more ammo for the stud shooters, and an OCTOPUS! The octopus is swooshable, looks really cool, and makes a perfect adversary for the diver.</p>

<p>The deep sea diver is lightly printed all over, so he looks simple, but detailed enough to actually resemble a dude in a wetsuit. I love the flippers and that visor, but having a motorcycle helmet on seems wrong to me. If it could be attached to a hairpiece, that would be really, really, cool.</p>

<p>The set itself consists of a sub scooter and a seaweed. The seaweed has really no purpose here, although it&#39;s nice to slap onto something else. Like a SpongeBob set. The scooter fulfills its intended purpose and is swooshable, but it bores me.</p>

<p>I really like the finished product for what it is. It&#39;s a cheap way to get an octopus, a very playable fig and scooter thing, and it very nicely complements the other Deep Sea sets.</p>

<p>So if you want an octopus, get this. If you want to add on to the submarine, get this and the starter set. If you want an octopus but actually want something substantial with it, get the Soldiers Outpost, it&#39;s only a little more expensive than the 2 smallest Deep Sea sets together. It&#39;s only $7, and this packs a big punch for a tiny set.</p>

<p>Did I mention octopus?</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:54:27.65Z","Decent offering of this Sub-Theme.","<p><strong>Set #60090 Deep Sea Scuba Scooter: </strong>Here&rsquo;s a small LEGO City set that introduces you to the underwater exploration elements of the LEGO City Theme. It&rsquo;s a small build that features little to discuss in a longer format, so we&rsquo;ll go quickly over the packaging design and other elements then finish off in letting you know if it&rsquo;s one you should track down.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: The LEGO City Theme has used the same blue box design for a good ten or more years by now. It&rsquo;s perfectly balanced between eye catching for the younger set and conservative for space when it comes to finding it on the shelves. Even the smallest boxes showcase the set quite well. The back shows some fun play options for the set too.</p>

<p>Instructions: The manual in this set is rather thin, using less than twenty pages, showing the build in clear and concise steps with nothing tricky or irritating as is customary in LEGO City sets. The final page shows the parts list and a cross-promotional shot of all the sets found in the Underwater Exploration Sub-Theme from 2015, which makes a very nice looking action shot for the sets from the sub-theme.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Scuba Diver: Dressed in black and red, this Minifigure has a double-sided torso print with some minor leg printing to show the bottom of his dive suit by including red stripes on the side of his pants. The head isn&rsquo;t special, it&rsquo;s fairly standard from LEGO City male characters with a little smile and bushy looking eyebrows, he&rsquo;s using the standard scuba gear with red flippers and a red helmet, he also has no accessories. His sub is were you&rsquo;ll find two spear guns attached.</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>Not a bad little mini-sub vehicle. It&rsquo;s a nice companion model for the larger sets from this sub-theme. The model does look nice, I like the use of yellow and grey combination which reminds me of the Aquanauts sets from the late nineties. You also have a small piece of seaweed on a tan circle plate and another red octopus with neon green studs for eyes.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>A fairly minimal set. If you aren&rsquo;t looking for a little submersible craft than this set is definitely easy to pass, I&rsquo;d recommend it mostly for the parts and as a cheap little army builder for MOC display fans who enjoy building up large displays of underwater adventures. Mildly recommended.</p>

"FlagsNZ","2016-01-08T05:40:20.407Z","Scoot around the deep sea; but watch out for the octopus","<p>Last year, I put together a special display of the LEGO&nbsp;City - Deep Sea Explorers sets which was shown at the <a href=""http://aucklandbrickshow.co.nz/"">Auckland Brick Show</a>.</p>

<p>The City theme has been awarded&nbsp;this year&#39;s Best Theme category&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=""http://gimmelego.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/the-gimme-lego-awards-2015.html"">Dr Dave Watford&#39;s&nbsp;Gimme&nbsp;Awards 2015</a>&nbsp;where he made special mention that&nbsp;one of the better City sets of 2015 was <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60095-1/Deep-Sea-Exploration-Vessel"">60095 Deep Sea Exploration Vessel</a>. Many <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/18469/brickset-awards-2015#comments"">Brickset&nbsp;members commented</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;various&nbsp;aspects of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/subtheme-Deep-Sea-Explorers"">Deep Sea Explorers sub theme</a>&nbsp;in the Brickset Awards.</p>

<p>I thought I would review the five sets that I own in this theme starting with 60090 Deep Sea Scuba Scooter.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a small set and there is nothing particularly outstanding about the box or instructions.</p>

<p>There are no stickers with this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 42 parts in this set and the standout component is the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4506995"">Octopus in New Dark Red</a>. This is a relatively rare creature and it is good to get one in such an inexpensive set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5674/24140217795_4424007bbd_b.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Scuba Scooter is driven by a diver. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107228"">torso</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107232"">legs</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107179"">red fins</a> are new in the Deep Sea Explorers theme. The torso and legs are printed&nbsp;with a red and black <a href=""https://www.padi.com/scuba-diving/padi-courses/course-catalog/about-scuba-gear/wetsuit-dry-suit/"">dry suit</a>. The torso print includes&nbsp;pressure gauges, regulator, air hoses and diver&#39;s weights.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5809/23512000904_509b83efe9_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The rear of the torso continues the print with the&nbsp;special watertight zipper, air hoses and more diver&#39;s weights.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1688/24114101376_14d7daa0b9_b.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a reasonably straight&nbsp;forward set&nbsp;to build.</p>

<p>The scooter has twin&nbsp;propellers&nbsp;attached to two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107171"">motor pods</a>. The diver has two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6043130"">spear guns</a>&nbsp;and can collect things using the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6012812"">grab arms</a> on&nbsp;the scooter.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The diver is driving the Deep Sea Scooter around some <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6059027"">sea grass</a>&nbsp;and on the lookout for the red octopus while collecting <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4119482"">turquoise&nbsp;crystals</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5766/23512001274_fa67b73903_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The minor flaw with this set is the exposed propellers: there should be protection for the&nbsp;diver&nbsp;so he is not as risk of being chewed up while diving.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is the smallest set in the Deep Sea Explorers sets. It is easily identified as a small set for younger LEGO builders which could be purchased with their pocket money.</p>

<p>It comes with a red octopus that gives this set a distinctive edge over similar sized and priced sets.</p>

<p>This is the first of five reviews that I will write for my five Deep Sea Explorers sets.&nbsp;</p>

"Witolman","2015-12-09T15:54:23.997Z","Red Octopus (and something else) set ","<p>I&#39;m trying to not make any mistakes, but English is not my native language.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I think the two blue jewels (probably diamonds, maybe saphires) and the Octopus are the most interesting parts here.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Red Octopus and one male scuba diver. Both really good. The octopus has some texture on it and can hold jewels in two of it&#39;s tentacles.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing interesting with instructions, but without it&#39;s a nice little challenge.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Scooter is a really good small build. The way the propellers are attached is interesting, but it&#39;s really simple overall. There are two harpoons, but who would want to shoot at this sweet octopus? :) There&#39;s also a 2x2 round plate with some seaweed, that makes this scene more believable and it&#39;s a really nice addition.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a good set, just like the starter, only even smaller. I only want a little bit more underwater plants. If you&#39;re interested in the red octopus, or this series I recommend this set, though I think the starter set is a better option.</p>

"KingAlanI","2016-02-11T03:06:17.56Z","Streamlined modern version of a classic topic","<p>I picked out this set because it would go with my other scuba diver minifigures and small underwater vehicles. Once I built it, I noticed it was a great modern design update of those things.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Somewhat of a moot point for a small set</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The octopus was a nice novelty. The scooter was really sleek looking The yellow half wedges were a little unstable, but the look made that worthwhile.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I liked the stripes on the diver&#39;s legs and the detailed equipment on his torso. Red was a nice new color for the standard design flippers. The tank and visor were also particularly detailed. I liked how the visor showed goggles and a snorkel rather than a mask or a smooth piece. This also helped raise and lower the visor when playing with the set called for that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The diver hanging so close to the propellers just didn&#39;t look right. I ended up adding one brick (black 2x4) and turned the flippers around so the diver wouldn&#39;t have to lean forward as much to clear the propellers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks really cool and fits in with older sets on a similar topic.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I got it on clearance and was glad I did but I&#39;m not sure if I like it at full price.</p>
