"DrFrankenstein","2015-11-03T05:58:38.267Z","Divers set with mismatched elements","<p>The set follows closely the successful formula of the Divers sets from 1997. Divers, treasure, underwater scenery, marine animals, submersible - all present. The box artwork is typical city theme with underwater flavor. However, unlike the classic Divers artwork, which portrayed peaceful leisurely exploration, the current variant places much greater emphasis on action and urgency. The sea is swooshing around, the submersible is buzzing through the water wielding its big claws, the shark is in attack mode, and the overall color tone is darker. I am not sure that the new style is better, but I suppose that this is consistent with LEGO&#39;s strategy for reaching the current target demographic. The parts inside came neatly organized in three numbered bags. Unfortunately, the two instruction booklets were not packed with a cardboard bag and ended up bent and wrinkled - not a major problem, but slightly annoying. To my surprise, the sticker sheet that I got looked a bit different than the one I have seen from the earlier set photos. My stickers did not feature transparency and had yellow and gray backgrounds instead. My guess is that LEGO updated the sticker sheet in the middle of the series&#39; production run, and I got one of the later batches.</p>

<p>The build was a breeze with the numbered bags and the bite-sized instruction steps. I did it in less than an hour while watching TV at the same time. The set contains a nice variety of parts including the whale skeleton and the redesigned shark figure introduced this year. The new shark is not dramatically different from its predecessor, but does feature a more realistic tail fin, gills, and printed eyes. The submersible is made out of a collection of modern bricks from various other themes. The diver minifig prints are new, even though they are based on the red-black color theme from the classic Divers sets.</p>

<p>The underwater scene with the bone, divers, and shark is cute. It&#39;s cool that one of the divers is a female who seems to enjoy photographing the scenery. The male diver is clearly less interested in the beauty of the ocean, but looks determined to crack the treasure chest open with a crowbar. The only small issue here is that the designers did not leave any hooks or rails for the divers to grab onto and get into various swimming poses. To me, this is miss since a large part of a divers&#39; set appeal is the ability to position the divers &quot;in the water&quot;.</p>

<p>The submersible resembles the shape of deep sea research subs that we have seen in movies. It is quite detailed and even includes two storage compartments on the side for the collected samples. The only part that I am less enthusiastic about are the huge utility arms that look mean, crude, and generally impractical. The classic Divers subs had far more realistic arms.</p>

<p>The set looks nice for the most part, but I can&#39;t escape the feeling that it attempts to jam together two mostly unrelated sets into one. The submersible is huge (two out of the tree numbered part bags are used in its construction). In fact it is bigger than the underwater scene and could easily bulldoze the whole rock formation - certainly overwhelming for the task of cracking the small treasure chest. In fact, in the real world this type of submersibles are designed for deep sea exploration at depths of thousands of meters where they slowly maneuver around and illuminate the darkness with powerful lights. Something like this would be totally impractical in the shallow water scene with the divers (perhaps 20-30 meters depth at most) where there is plenty of daylight and the surge action of the waves would make the sub unstable for millimeter precision operations.</p>

<p>Still, if we close our eyes to the obvious mismatch between the deep sea exploration sub and the shallow water reef scene, this is a very reasonable divers set with interesting elements. While it does not innovate dramatically over the classic Divers theme, it brings enough fresh elements to make the theme appealing to a new generation of LEGO fans.</p>

"CrescentSky","2015-11-07T05:06:50.287Z","We All Live In A Yellow Submarine...","<p>I bought this set along with 60095 Deep Sea Exploration Vessel and 60091 Deep Sea Starter Set, both of which are great sets, and this is no different.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Being a medium-priced set, the box is fairly large, and I feel it was too big for the amount of parts that are actually inside. The cover is in the normal city design, and the back shows different scenes in a comic book style. The instructions, like with all city sets, are easy and very step-by-step, and I only very occasionally miss pieces because I often don&#39;t pay enough attention.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set has some very uncommon parts and in uncommon colors, like the large leaf piece in dark red and the large bubble canopy.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The three minifigures (two divers and one operator) are welcome, as it could have gotten away with only two. My only complaints are the lack of different head prints. The operator is the same as we got in the Deep Sea Exploration Vessel, and both the divers also have the same faces as in the Deep Sea Exploration Vessel. The shark is also a nice addition, and there is a crab as well. Over all&nbsp;not terrible, but could have been better.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I found the build quite underwhelming. The sub looks more complicated than it really is. Most of it is hollow space in the front, and the back is covered in equipment. It is a nice build for younger kids, though. The terrain is based on a large rock piece, which I know some dislike, but it has more to it than that. For older kids and adults,&nbsp;the build may be a bit too simple, but it is perfect for younger fans.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model looks very good for display and has good playability with the two large mechanical arms and a sturdy construction for &quot;swooshing&quot; around underwater. The divers can recover the treasure form the whale skeleton and bring it back to the surface.&nbsp;This set goes especially well with other sets in the subtheme. Although it is a bit pricey, it is a fine set by itself and great with others in the line.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I like this set. It looks good, has good playability, and is great for kids. I even find myself taking off of my display to play with it occasionally.I always loved exploration themes and this is a nice set for a so far great theme.&nbsp;I would recommend it if you like the deep sea exploration theme and you have a good place for it.&nbsp;</p>

"FlagsNZ","2016-02-16T01:39:03.107Z","Undertake your own Deep Sea Exploration in the latest yellow submersible ","<p>I have been writing a series of reviews for my Deep Water Explorers&nbsp;sets. This is the third review&nbsp;in this series; I have already reviewed&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49668"">60090 Deep Sea Scooter</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49871"">60091 Deep Sea Starter Set</a>.</p>

<p>Of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/subtheme-Deep-Sea-Explorers"">Deep Sea Explorers</a> sets, this is my favourite.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a box with very strikingly clear images on it. The front shows the submersible&nbsp;swishing though the water against an underwater background.</p>

<p>The rear of the box shows the various play aspects and a breakdown of the bagged parts.</p>

<p>The instructions come in two books: book 1 builds the underwater scene while book 2 is for the submarine.</p>

<p>There is a moderate sized sticker sheet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5784/24057590421_3895319527_b.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 666px;"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are separated into three numbered bags; Bag 1 has parts for the underwater scene, bag&nbsp;2 makes the hull of the submarine and bag 3&nbsp;completes the submarine with the two dark stone grey&nbsp;oxygen tanks and robotic arms.</p>

<p>There are a few parts unique to this set:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6112605"">88mm Technic&nbsp;tube</a></li>
	<li>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6110028"">skeleton fin</a>&nbsp;is unique in white</li>
	<li>the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6100888"">yellow nozzle</a>&nbsp;is unique in this colour</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with three minifigures; two scuba divers and the submersible pilot.</p>

<p>The two&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">scuba divers</a>&nbsp;are in distinctive dry suits that have torso prints that include pressure gauges, regulator, air hoses and diver&#39;s weights. One diver holds a crow bar while the other has an underwater camera. These two divers can also be found in the Deep Sea Starter set.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107228"">torso</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107232"">legs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107179"">red fins</a>&nbsp;are new in the Deep Sea Explorers theme. The torso and legs are printed with a red and black&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.padi.com/scuba-diving/padi-courses/course-catalog/about-scuba-gear/wetsuit-dry-suit/"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab..

<p>The submersible pilot is wearing a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6113983"">brick red turtle neck jumper</a> underneath&nbsp;an orange vest. He has a small radio in the vest pocket.</p>

<p>As it gets quite cold the deeper the depth, the pilot is wearing a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6113985"">brick red beanie</a>.</p>

<p>The torso is unique to the Deep Sea Explorers theme while the beanie is new in this colour in this theme.</p>

<p>The Deep Sea Explorers logo is printed on the back of the torso.</p>

<p>The deep waters that surround LEGO City must be fertile&nbsp;with fish as they are&nbsp;infested with&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_reef_shark"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">grey reef sharks</a>.</p>

<p>There is also a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4277338"">yellow crab</a> included in this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is a moderate build and would challenge some of the younger target age group.</p>

<p>The first part of the build is assembling the two divers and shark before tackling the underwater scene.</p>

<p>The scene is made up predominantly with a dark stone grey <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4216709"">little ugly rock piece</a>&nbsp;(LURP).</p>

<p>There is a treasure chest hidden beneath&nbsp;whale skeleton&nbsp;made up from white skeleton fins and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6110023"">ribs</a>. The treasure chest contains <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4528605"">gold bars</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4649422"">bullion</a> along with some <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4119482"">sapphire</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4113954"">ruby</a>&nbsp;jewels.</p>

<p>The yellow submersible is built in two stages; stage 1 makes the pressure hull while stage 2 assembles the oxygen tanks and robotic arms.</p>

<p>The left robotic arm has small claw, a camera, a grinding tool and an echo locator. The right robotic arm has a more substantial claw which can grip onto larger items.</p>

<p>There is plenty of lighting to see through the murky&nbsp;ocean depths.</p>

<p>I have not applied any stickers to this set and I do not think that this has distracted any of its overall finished look.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1684/24057591621_9203ec073e_b.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 529px;"" /></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When all put together, the set includes a robust submersible vehicle and&nbsp;two scuba divers who are checking out a dive site where there may be some treasure. Also on the prowl is a grey reef shark looking for some food.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1676/23844553010_884baea881_b.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 370px;"" /></p>

<p>There have been several submersibles used by research institutes. <a href=""http://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/technology/subs/subs.html"">The most famous submersible is Alvin</a>, which has operated since 1964 and is owned by the <a href=""http://www.whoi.edu/main/ndsf"">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute</a>.&nbsp;Submersibles from this institute remain&nbsp;at the <a href=""http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/Galapagos"">forefront of underwater exploration and research</a>.</p>

<p>The Deep Sea Explorers&nbsp;submersible has features that&nbsp;closely resemble&nbsp;many aspects of modern submersibles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The underwater scene suits the scuba diver aspect of this set; the divers can swim around looking for treasure while at all times on the lookout&nbsp;for marauding sharks.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1711/24114113496_ac41556996_b.jpg"" style=""width: 661px; height: 800px;"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It is unlikely that a submersible of the type represented in this set would work alongside scuba divers: they operate at such differing depths and environments.</p>

<p>That being said, any child who has watched nature or scientific&nbsp;shows on TV would easily recognise this set for what it represents.</p>

<p>There is plenty of play opportunities with this set with a realistic underwater scene. I think this set will appeal to a wide range of LEGO fans.</p>

<p>This set is <a href=""http://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=oSv/vWYkQIY&amp;offerid=124738.60092&amp;type=15&amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fshop.lego.com%2Fen-GB%2FDeep-Sea-Submarine-60092"">still available in stores</a>.</p>

"Kierloway","2016-09-07T18:49:43.757Z","Great build. Wait for discounted pricing.","<p>Fun build, but not worth it at $40 despite a few larger pieces. Overall though, good job Lego!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Easy enough to follow along as usual, predictable due to symmetry.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I love the part variation in this set. You get a nice mix of colors and unique parts you don&#39;t see in a lot of sets. Very happy with that.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A couple of divers and sub operator plus a shark. Great figures and I can&#39;t wait to use them in my MOC.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It went a bit too quickly but it was fun. I like the way the hatch attaches.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks great overall, but I felt it needed just a couple of upgrades. I put about 4 1x1 tiles on it to add some more &quot;lighting&quot; and cover the gray studs on the top fins. Even without doing that it still looks great. I can&#39;t wait to put this is my underwater themed MOC!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a must buy if you&#39;re going to be doing anything underwater. I may even get a 2nd one to have a team of machines doing exploring! The drones that come with the other sets are nice, but this one is the best.</p>
