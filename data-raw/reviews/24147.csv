"Skut","2016-01-08T05:58:29.893Z","Heights and depths in one set","<p>Overall this is a&nbsp;good&nbsp;set.&nbsp; It has lots of play value and some great features, although it does have a few flaws as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set concept is A1.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know how strictly realistic it is to have a helicopter deploying a submersible, but in terms of play value it rocks!&nbsp; Plus your kids will learn fine motor coordination and patience attempting to&nbsp;snag the submarine back onto the chopper&#39;s hook!</p>

<p>The build is entertaining without being too taxing - the only help a small person may need is fitting the string to the helicopter&#39;s winch mechanism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helicopter model is lots of fun and has great features - a side door, cargo winch and rear ramp.&nbsp; Its overall appearance is nice and well-proportioned;&nbsp;it also&nbsp;shows how far we&#39;ve come since the catastrophe that was 4439 heavy lift helicopter only three years before this model.&nbsp; Nevertheless Lego has still chosen to base the&nbsp;design of&nbsp;this chopper on a Chinook rather than a Sea Knight, which is a shame because the Sea Knight, with rear sponsons and a tricycle undercarriage, is a more authentic &quot;nautical&quot; helicopter and is better looking than the Chinook (side sponsons and quad undercarriage).&nbsp; Like 4439, this&nbsp;helicopter also features a &quot;shopping trolley&quot; undercarriage which tends to flop around everywhere as the chopper flies around.&nbsp; Heaven knows what happens when you land it on a pitching deck...</p>

<p>To the submarine... The sub is very attractive in terms of colour scheme, but has a weird and frustrating flaw that the windscreen does not cover the opening at the front.&nbsp; Okay, it&#39;s Lego City, not a scale model, but surely a watertight submarine is not too much to ask?&nbsp; The manipulator arms are also rather stubby - it makes the sub a bit T-Rex like and I can&#39;t really see how this sub could interact with anything on the ocean floor.&nbsp; Frankly, the submarines from the (Town) Divers series in 1997 were superior in terms of looks and play value.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t yet built the other subs from the 2015 Deep Sea Explorers line so I can&#39;t comment on whether this is a general problem&nbsp;or if it is unique to this particular sub.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs are a highlight; City is not renowned for its minifigs but this set is something of an exception; the combination of chopper pilot, diver and submersible pilot give a great variety of colours, functions and accessories.&nbsp; The shark is also a very useful addition, though it was a bit&nbsp;unfair that the set designers didn&#39;t give the diver&nbsp;a speargun. What with the non-watertight submarine it seems Lego wants Davy Jones to hold onto his treasures (and any Lego minifigs foolish enough to venture underwater with their substandard kit)!</p>

<p>Unfortunately the set contains stickers printed on Lego&#39;s infamous low quality white paper.&nbsp; This is compounded by the fact that stickers are to be applied to the (curved) sides of the chopper&#39;s engines.&nbsp; Good luck getting those ones to stay on!&nbsp; I hear rumours that the 2016 City sets contain a new sticker material; let&#39;s hope it&#39;s an improvement on the current version, whose typical lifespan is around 2 years before cracking up and falling off.&nbsp; That sort of low quality might work for other toy brands but Lego should be (and otherwise usually is) built to last.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the small gripes above, the detractions can&#39;t take away from what is, in the final analysis, a very well conceived and fun set.&nbsp; Kids will really love this set and it should see many hours of happy play.&nbsp;</p>

"FlagsNZ","2016-02-17T01:56:14.133Z","Resupply your Deep Sea Explorers by flying in with your mini submersible","<p>This is the fourth review in my Deep Sea Explorers&nbsp;themed sets.</p>

<p>You can read my reviews for&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49668"">60090 Deep Sea Scooter</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49871"">60091 Deep Sea Starter Set</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/49874"">60092 Deep Sea Submarine</a> sets.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a medium sized City box. It shows the helicopter winching the submersible out of the water with the submersible&nbsp;grasping a treasure chest in one of the robotic arms.</p>

<p>A scuba diver is swimming on the surface with a grey reef shark snapping at the missed submersible.</p>

<p>The instructions come in three books; book 1 makes the yellow submersible, book 2 makes the helicopter fuselage&nbsp;and book 3 completes the helicopter.</p>

<p>There is a medium sized sticker sheet. I tend not to apply stickers to my LEGO and many of these stickers&nbsp;should be applied onto curved surfaces.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1608/24032190152_995c74cb4d_b.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts come in three bags that match the three instruction books.</p>

<p>This set introduces a few parts in Earth Blue for first time;&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6115456"">Brick W. Bow 4X1X1 1/3</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6115447"">Brick W. Arch 1X1X1 1/3</a>&nbsp;and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6097643"">helicopter cockpit</a>. I really like this earth blue colour.</p>

<p>There are also some new yellow parts in this set;&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6102524"">2x2 Round With&nbsp;Hole</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4651505"">car bonnet</a>&nbsp;and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6071270"">1x1 Plate with Upright Holder</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6115443"">clear dome</a>&nbsp;on the submersible is only found in this set and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60095-1/Deep-Sea-Exploration-Vessel"">60095 Deep Sea Exploration Vessel</a>.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set has three minifigures; a&nbsp;submersible pilot, a diver and a helicopter pilot.</p>

<p>The submersible pilot is wearing a&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6113983"">brick red turtle neck jumper</a>&nbsp;underneath an orange vest. She has a small radio in the vest pocket.</p>

<p>Unlike her male counterpart in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60092-1/Deep-Sea-Submarine"">60092 Deep Sea Submarine</a>, she does not need a&nbsp;beanie to keep her head warm.</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scuba_diving"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab.. Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">scuba diver</a>&nbsp;has a distinctive dry suit&nbsp;that has a torso print&nbsp;that includes pressure gauges, regulator, air hoses and diver&#39;s weights. The diver holds a waterproof portable radio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107228"">torso</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107232"">legs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6107179"">red fins</a>&nbsp;are new in the Deep Sea Explorers theme. The torso and legs are printed with a red and black&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.padi.com/scuba-diving/padi-courses/course-catalog/about-scuba-gear/wetsuit-dry-suit/"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab..

<p>The helicopter pilot is wearing a red and white striped flight jacket with a safety harness. He has blue trousers with <a href=""http://www.transair.co.uk/sp+Flight-suits-Military-Nomex-Flightsuit-Flightsuit-Knee-Pocket-Plastic-Boards+4206"">flight&nbsp;suit knee pockets</a>. In the pocket on his left knee he has a weather map and in the right knee pocket there is a marker pen.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1459/23513400083_99b58b0936_b.jpg"" /></p>

<p>All three torsos continue the&nbsp;print on the rear. The helicopter pilot&#39;s jacket continues the red and white stripes with&nbsp;safety harness,&nbsp;the diver has a&nbsp;special watertight zipper, air hoses and more diver&#39;s weights and the Deep Sea Explorers logo is printed on the back of the torso of the submersible pilot.</p>

<p>The two nautical outfits are unique to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/subtheme-Deep-Sea-Explorers"">Deep Sea Explorers&nbsp;theme</a> but the helicopter pilot has been seen in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6032091"">LEGO City sets since 2012</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5829/24032105552_8519bc30a6_b.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Book 1 with bag 1 first makes the two nautical minifigures, grey reef shark and treasure chest. The build then turns to making the yellow submersible.</p>

<p>The submersible pilot is in the yellow pressure hull. There are two yellow oxygen tanks protected by <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/658326"">strong black frames</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1492/24032104992_b45171f7fd_b.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There are two small robotic arms and the submersible has plenty of lighting for seeing through murky water.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5781/23844548580_3d46f26d46_b.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The clear dome does not completely seal the pressure hull.</p>

<p>Books 2 and 3 together with the corresponding bags makes the helicopter.</p>

<p>The pilot sits in a cockpit&nbsp;and has a control panel.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5624/24140208195_b3de7799f0_b.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The helicopter has a cargo ramp and two side cargo doors that open. There is a winch operated from the left (port) side.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1674/24114092196_43807155df_b.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The helicopter has a pair of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandem_rotors"">tandem rotors</a> and looks very similar to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_CH-47_Chinook"">Boeing CH-47&nbsp;Chinook</a>.</p>

<p>All four wheels are on castors so the helicopter&nbsp;can drive around in any direction it chooses.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5734/24114091156_776e69b8bf_b.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I&nbsp;have not applied the stickers to this set. I think it still looks great without them.</p>

<p>The treasure chest is not shown.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This helicopter has enormous play features. The winch operates very easily and lifts the submersible well. There could have been some cargo on a pellet stowed in the rear of the helicopter but it would be easy to make something up with 4x2 bricks.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Boeing CH-47 Chinook has a lifting capacity of 12,700&nbsp;kg&nbsp;(28,000&nbsp;lb).&nbsp;The <a href=""http://www.whoi.edu/main/deepseachallenger"">smallest single person submersibles</a> weigh&nbsp;11.8 tonnes&nbsp;(13 short tons), just inside the lifting capacity of this helicopter.</p>

<p>I do hope that LEGO sets like the sets in the Deep Sea Explorers theme helps raise the awareness of scientific exploration in children.</p>

<p>There are small submersibles similar to the one in this set <a href=""http://www.whoi.edu/news-release/Galapagos"">operating at oceanographic research institutes</a>.</p>

<p>This set is still <a href=""http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Deep-Sea-Helicopter-60093;jsessionid=B0CB59297A846661215192EF8B9735D8.lego-ps16?CMP=AFC-AffiliateUK&amp;ShipTo=GB&amp;_requestid=546232"">available in stores</a>.</p>
