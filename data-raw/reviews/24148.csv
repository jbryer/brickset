"Buku","2015-12-02T18:20:18.9Z","Lives up to expectations","<p>I reviewed Deep Sea Operation Base (60096-1) about two weeks ago and mentioned that i&#39;d be getting this set soon to provide the underwater scene that the base lacked. A 20% mark down on&nbsp;Black Friday provided all the opportunity (excuse) I needed.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Obviously let&#39;s start with the centrepiece, the Exploration Vessel. It&#39;s bigger than I expected. For the sake of comparison it&#39;s nearly&nbsp;twice the width of the hull used for Arctic Icebreaker and although the internal&nbsp;brickbase&nbsp;is&nbsp;at almost exactly the same height, the raised bow makes it seem more imposing. However, it is shorter at approx 75% (to my eye)&nbsp;of the length of the Icebreaker. The cut-out back works perfectly for providing stability when using the crane in water. A great hull piece.</p>

<p>The couple of decent sized sand coloured baseplates&nbsp;are nice and would make&nbsp;welcome additions to any city beach.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 4 bow pieces of the wreck will inevitably lead to an attempt by me to make a small boat for the soldiers faction to use against the pirates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4 sharks plus an octopus is a bit overkill to me but certainly not to my daughter.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Seven! The Captain looks the part and like any LEGO captain sports a beard. The welding torch used by the minifig with the large breathing apparatus&nbsp;doesn&#39;t appear very durable; would be good if a spare was provided. Two of the four &quot;normal&quot; divers are female.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was a very tough build by City standards. My 3 and a half year old just didn&#39;t have the dexterity to handle several parts of the build. In most builds I&#39;ll just do most of the technic pins, rig any string,&nbsp;and the stickers, but this one required me to do a lot more. I even had to look closely at the instructions when building the wreck to make sure I was putting some bricks on the right level of the bow.</p>

<p>The horizontal use of the forklift/digger frame for the submersible is clever and no doubt allowed some bricks to be used elsewhere in the set but I&#39;m not a big fan of how it looks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It simply looks great. It really does. The vessel (especially the imposing bridge) and the wreck that is. I personally don&#39;t care much for the appearance of the&nbsp;submersibles. For what its worth my daughter prefers to use the slightly bigger submersible from&nbsp;60096-1.</p>

<p>The play function via the collapsing bridge of the shipwreck certainly adds a little something whilst any crane is a winner in this household.</p>

<p>The shipwreck certainly looks busy, in a good way, with the number of minifigs and aquatic life around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last but not least, that the ship floats (and the dinghy too) just tops things off.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If I could only have one set from the theme I&#39;d take this over&nbsp;60096-1. The shipwreck elevates it from a playability perspective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naturally my&nbsp;daughter is desperate to visit the aquarium again as soon as possible.</p>

"DrFrankenstein","2016-02-07T04:56:37.913Z","Interesting shipwreck scene","<p>This is perhaps the most fully developed divers set of the season. The exploration vessel is appropriate large to house the dive team and support crew. It even has room for the orange dinghy on the bow. It comes a bit short however, so no room is left the submersible, scooter, and ROV. The ship is quite detailed with lots of nice touches, such as the set of orange fenders hanging from the sides, the radar, safety buoys, controls, etc. The crane lowers the shark cage smoothly and is perhaps the nicest function of the ship. The superstructure of the vessel comes off to reveal a cabin with two beds inside the hill - a nice idea, but a bit underdeveloped.</p>

<p>The centerpiece of the set is the shipwreck scene that&nbsp; provides a suitable playground for the divers to search for treasures and also a habitat for the corals and sear critter that inhabit the sea floor. The wreck is deteriorating and getting overgrown with seaweed and coral much like a real shipwreck. A group of vicious-looking sharks is guarding the wreck. A hidden trigger on the side of the wreck causes the bridge to collapse suddenly - does not looks too exciting, but provides a bit of additional playability there. The design of the bridge gives the wreck the look of a relatively modern fishing or cargo boat. Would have been more exciting if the ship were, for instance, a 18th century wooden sailboat.</p>

<p>The build is fun and fairly straight forward with the 717 parts separated in 8 numbered bags. The underwater scene provides some challenge getting the parts in the right place, but it&#39;s not too bad. The instruction booklets are clear and easy to follow.</p>

<p>At $120 the set is a bit overpriced. Its aftermarket price is a of this writing $80 for a sealed set, which is 33% less than LEGO&#39;s price. I think aftermarket price reflects better the value fo the set.</p>

<p>I think this is a very nice divers set that provides tons of fun and playability. The shipwreck is particularly cool. The exploration vessel is massive. The multitude of divers, sharks, and submersibles make for a busy underwater scene. Without doubt, this is the nicest of the 2015 divers sets.</p>

"brickman3","2016-07-20T22:17:21.64Z","Well Made, Matey!","<p>Before I start, I&#39;d like to mention I also do YouTube videos on LEGO reviews. You can check out my channel here:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTYomWDLzV-JtRay2IPcvzA</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while since I wrote a review. This set, however, is definitely worth it. Cost is decent, at $120 US dollars, although I personally think it could be lower. Let&#39;s just move on to the review. If you&#39;ve read some of my other reviews, I went minifigures, then model. I guess I&#39;ll do that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Divers:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 5&nbsp;divers included with this set,&nbsp;each with a different face printing.Two of them have flippers, one has a remote for one of the mini-subs, one has a camera, and the other two are just generic. All of them have air tanks and helmets with snorkels, but other than that they are all different. However, there is one other diver that is completely different. He is in an orange jumpsuit, with a giant diving helmet and a blowtorch. His face is also different from the others. I&#39;m guessing he is used more for deep underwater missions, although there isn&#39;t much to say for sure. He&#39;s still pretty cool, though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Crewman:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This guy isn&#39;t much. He is pretty generic, with a knit cap and a jacket printed on his torso piece. Based on where he&#39;s standing, he is the first mate and controls the winch. Not bad for a generic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Captain:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though the captain is the leader of this vessel, they still left him pretty generic, physical-wise. His printing makes him look like a captain, with a rugged beard printed and him wearing a sailor&#39;s hat, which I honestly think should have been on the crewman&#39;s head. Still, he looks good for a captain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sharks and Squid</strong><strong>:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though the sharks aren&#39;t Minifigures, I figured they weren&#39;t part of the set, so I would instead review them as a minifigure. Anyway, there 4 sharks and 1 squid. Two of the sharks are generic, found multiple sets, such as 60011: Surfer Rescue. Another one is a great white, which is only found in one other set-&nbsp;Set 60013: Coast Guard&nbsp;Helicopter, so it&#39;s pretty rare. The final shark is a sawtooth shark, which was only found in 1 other set, from the Pirates theme, set 70413: The Brick Bounty. So two of these sharks are quite rare. Anyway, the squid is uncommon as well. It&nbsp;is found in two other sets: Set 6240 Kraken Attackin&#39; and Set 60090 Deep Sea Scuba Scooter. Wow, these guys are rare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before I begin to review the model, I wanted to give a little recognition to a piece that I can&#39;t review on its own, because it&#39;s too small. On the far left of the image&nbsp;on the website, there is a tiny poll next to the blowtorch diver. Just thought I&#39;d point it out. It has a sticker as the flag. Anyway, back to your regularly scheduled program.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mini Boats:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 3 tiny vessels in this set: a motor-powered raft and three different types of submarines. The raft is nothing special; just an average orange boat with a motor at the back. While there is a little detailing on it, the boat doesn&#39;t really stand out. Anyway, let&#39;s go to the subs. The one to the far left is the most difficult to use, in my opinion. While trying to attach the diver to it, they either loose a flipper of the helmet comes off. This one is my least favorite. Still, it has a place to store the crowbar and hammer, so it&#39;s still cool. The middle one is my personal favorite. This one seats on person, has movable jets in the back, and has adjustable&nbsp;claws to grab stuff. This one&#39;s awesome. The one on the right is remote controlled by one of the divers. It has one claw, and what looks like a camera. This one is probably used for going into dangerous areas. There is also a cage that can be lowered by the crane, so that a diver can watch the sharks without getting killed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Abandoned Ship:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This ship is really neat. It creates an atmosphere of desolation, and while it is in ruins, looks cool. There is a feature that allows the viewing deck fall, to trap anyone and anything that attempts to retrieve the treasure is inside. Really cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Diving Command Ship:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the big one. This ship has so many neat features. You can lift the hood of the viewing deck to seat the captain inside. If you remove the entire viewing deck there is two beds underneath for them to rest. Up front is an area where the orange raft is stored. The crane in the back is held by a rope which must be tied in. This whole thing is so cool in general.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, this set is definitely worth it. The price is a little much, but eventually it will become unpopular and LEGO will lower the price. Thanks for reading! :)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard colorful City box with play ideas and features.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I always feel like I am cheating when one piece (hull) represents more than half the build. &nbsp;But both boats float and that alone adds so much playability. &nbsp;Some other parts that may be of interest include lots of chains and the start of a second boat from the shipwreck scene.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is one of two places the set fails. &nbsp;We get 7 minifigs - but 4 of them are basically identical red-clad divers. &nbsp;On the other hand you only get ONE crewman. You get the captain, but only one guy to work the winch, maintain the boat and inhabit the quarters below. &nbsp;Considering the Deep Sea Starter Set (60091) came with only divers (2 red and one orange), it would have been nice if this set gave us at least two crewman to man this huge boat. &nbsp;Also, none of the other Deep Sea sets except 60092&nbsp;come with a ship crewman (though some do include non-divers).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The age range 8-12 reflects a slightly&nbsp;tougher build than usual in the City line. &nbsp;There is a string which generally gives small kids trouble, as well as some careful counting to do in creating the shipwreck. &nbsp;Overall though a typical breezy City build with very easy instructions and multiple bags.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The second knock on this set is that it would have been very easy - and MOC could do - for them to add some sort of dock or port for even one of the three submersibles. &nbsp;As it is, there is no way for them to travel with the Vessel. &nbsp;There is also no sensible way for divers to enter/exit the cage, or return to the boat, nor&nbsp;is there any practical way to get the raft from the front of the hull into the water.&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems playability would have went through the roof if they had used some creativity on the open back of the vessel to give us either a ladder or a dock or some other way to&nbsp;have the main vessel accommodate&nbsp;the divers and vehicles.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Handsome set with some overkill (sharks and red clad divers) that is not worth full MSRP but a great deal at around $75.</p>

"lentil","2017-03-07T18:40:52.31Z","Nice twist on an underwater set!","<p>I like this set quite a bit, and waffled between 4 and 5 stars for the rating. If we had a half star scale I&#39;d give it a 4.5. It&#39;s really a very nice set with lots of fun details and playable elements. Here&#39;s what I like about it:</p>

<h3>The Main Vessel</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The main exploration vessel is large, with lots of room on deck for crew and passengers to gather and enjoy the ocean view.</li>
	<li>Bright, attractive color scheme in white and dark blue, with bright yellow and orange accents. The bright orange buoys dangling over the sides with chains look particularly sharp. The look overall is fresh, modern, and peppy!</li>
	<li>Love the trans light blue windshields, and the other trans elements (in red, green, and yellow) which are used as lights all around. The blue windows have a great classic look that makes me giddy.</li>
	<li>The one piece plastic hull of the main vessel means it floats, as does the little orange raft. My daughter enjoys playing with this set both in and out of water. I&#39;m not too thrilled about it getting wet constantly (especially since the outside is covered in stickers...), but it certainly adds some realism to the diving play.</li>
	<li>The large cockpit is highly detailed, with lots of controls and switches, a steering wheel, and a chair for the captain. There is also space for several other minifigs to travel in here.</li>
	<li>Below the cockpit is a spacious below deck area. It is somewhat sparsely furnished, with two simple cots and two small side tables. Each table has a spiffy green lamp on it, one has a coffee mug, and one has a newspaper. There is lots of empty space as well should you want to stow some cargo down there.</li>
	<li>There is a wonderfully fun winch to lower and raise the shark cage. The shark cage is sturdily constructed, yet opens and closes quite easily and can fit up to two divers. The winch and shark cage are probably the favorite play aspect of this set with my daughter and her friends.</li>
	<li>Con: my biggest complaint about the design is that it is difficult to access the fun cockpit and below deck areas. You must remove the roof to access the cockpit, and the entire cockpit has to be removed to access the below deck. While this is possible, it is cumbersome and awkward, and difficult in particular for a child to do without breaking some elements. It would have been preferable for these areas to be accessible with some sort of hinge/door mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Critters and Minifigures</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Lots of awesome sharks! The sawtooth shark and the great white are especially nice. Also the dark red octopus with creepy yellow eyes is both beautiful and sinister. All are very fun to play with and make this set particularly special.</li>
	<li>7 minifigures gives you plenty of shark food. :-) There is a captain, one crewman, and five different divers, including two females. I love their highly detailed accessories: little goggles, breathing tanks, and flippers, as well as a variety of useful tools.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Submersibles and Raft</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The floating orange raft is fairly simple. It seats two and contains a chain for towing, and a simple pretend motor and speed control.</li>
	<li>The three submersible vehicles are all attractively designed in bright yellow, black and gray. The large one is the most fun. It has a cage-like roof and a clear trans half sphere windshield, both of which are hinged and can be opened and closed to easily seat the passenger. It also has two posable, rotating arms that can really pick up submerged items (such as chests of gold) that you may find on the ocean floor. It also has two propeller engines that can be positioned to steer the vehicle in various directions. Lots of fun with this one.</li>
	<li>The medium vehicle has two propellers, and carries a crowbar and hammer. The passenger must ride this one by grabbing onto some handlebars with his hands, which is awkward and difficult to manage. It looks cute but not much to do with this one.</li>
	<li>The smallest vehicle is a remote controlled camera. It has a propeller on the back and ski like tracks on the bottom, plus one rotating, posable arm. This one cannot carry passengers, but it&#39;s potentially fun to pretend with the remote controller.</li>
	<li>Adding in the above-mentioned shark cage, there is a great assortment of little vehicles to add playability to this set!</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Sunken Ship</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The great &quot;twist&quot; of this set is that in addition to the main ship, there is a sunken wreck at the bottom of the ocean! The sunken ship is in more subdued tones of black, white, and dark red, and is attractively overgrown with seaweed and algae. The hull is built up of several 1 brick high angled hull-shaped pieces, giving it a deteriorated, skeletal look.</li>
	<li>On the floor of the hull are two crates filled with sunken treasure - shiny gold tiles! There are three of these inside each crate, plus 10 on the stairs outside, for a total of 16 attractive pieces of bling.</li>
	<li>Pulling out the stairs triggers a mechanism that drops the entire cockpit onto the sunken crates, smashing this large structure fairly hard onto the crates or whatever is below! So far no Lego pieces have been harmed in doing this, but it seems a bit extreme... not sure I&#39;d want a kid to do this repeatedly where those lovely trans blue windows are involved!</li>
	<li>This was probably not intentional, but the back of the BURPs in the underwater mountain are hollow and make nice little caves/hiding places for sharks, divers, treasure, or whatever... also a fun feature.</li>
	<li>Con: I think it would have been even more interesting if the sunken vessel were an old pirate ship or something like that, or if the buried treasure included sparkling jewels and diamonds as well as gold bricks. A skeleton would have been really cool too, ideally hidden in a small room behind a door. Perhaps also some giant whale bones at the edge? I love the idea of the sunken ship here - it really adds a fun dimension to this set, and gives the divers some concrete place to go, but I wish they had gone full whole-hog romantic on the sunken treasure thing. Seems like they were a bit &quot;cautious&quot; with the design, which is a missed opportunity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall though I do think this is a great set. Considering the moderate piece count, the finished set is larger and more extensive than one would expect (probably due in part to the large size of the main hull piece). It&#39;s got a lot of fun details and touches and is fun to play with. The design is a visual treat: streamlined, bright, and elegant. It is somewhat similar to some recent Coast Guard sets, but much improved in my opinion, both visually and in terms of details and playability. Overall I&#39;d say it&#39;s the most attractive and fun modern ship set Lego has produced to date!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it represents a very good value at RRP though... that is too high by at least 20%. Snap it up used or if you can find a discount.</p>

"Bluelegoman","2023-04-21T17:56:48.717Z","Great set","<p>I am one of those people who has never really been into city sets, but this one stands out. Got it for my birthday when I was younger, and had a great time building it. The parts have been useful for Mocs later on, the white shark is just really cool, and the old sunken ship was just a great feature. This is one of the best LEGO city sets in my humble opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, and the minifigures, lots of minifigures!&nbsp; I am one of those that believe that minifigures can make or break a set, and this set, which is already great, is made even better by the amount of minifigures included. And they&#39;re good quality figures as well!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, 10/10 LEGO city set. Would absolutely recommend finding one for any kid who loves ships and diving and the ocean in general.&nbsp;</p>
