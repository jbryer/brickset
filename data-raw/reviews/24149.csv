"StevenBuilder","2015-05-26T18:58:32.71Z","60097 City Square - First Sightings","<p>Today, 2 City Square 60097 kits were spotted in the local ToysRUs&nbsp;store in Montreal. This seems like a very early release for Canada, and at $229 CDN it seemed like a fair price (taking into consideration the current CDN-US exchange rate).</p>

<p>Well, there is only one set left at that ToysRUs now; the other is sitting safely in my Lego hobby room.</p>

<p>With only a few minutes to open the box and quickly review the contents, I am a happy builder, with no buyer&#39;s remorse.</p>

<p>Although I like when the building are a full buildout, the&nbsp;open structures of the auto center and the Lego store will allow for a little creativity and customization, much like the cycle shop and pizza place in an earlier version, Town Square 60026.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read a fair number of emails and commentary from people wishing the trolley was motorized. I for one am happy to have this less expensive track-enabled element. With the amount of space I have, a circular train track would be an extravagant&nbsp;use of space and the motorized feature would be overkill.&nbsp;The trolley will allow me to add a single track feature to my setup without completely&nbsp;dominating the&nbsp;space.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for now. I&#39;ll try and add a bit more when I am actually in the building stage.</p>

<p>Things get done, one block at a time.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Next we have a nice little Lego Store, smaller than the Car Dealership, but still manages to squeeze in a lot of fun internal details for a nice overall package. &nbsp;This is a two story tall building with only one floor. The building is a nice fusion of an older traditional row store with a modern update using glass windows and Lego Store signage. &nbsp;The traditional feel is given using the back side of masonry blocks along with nice detailing on the roof line and a building date (1932). &nbsp; The store also includes a roof top vent/HVAC, some vent detailing on the building sides and a standard city light post with a bus stop sign.&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Inside we see all sorts of fun details. &nbsp;There is a large red 2x4 brick on display in the window, a demolition set box display in the other window, a service desk with computer and a slow to hold a brick built Lego bag and a mini-figure displaying (using a micro figure). &nbsp;On the two walls we have a pick-a-brick display behind the service counter and on the other side are some glass shelves with various set boxes with printed faces. &nbsp;There is also a ledge behind the second floor windows that holds classic Space and Castle minifigs, a really nice touch that makes this building shine! &nbsp;The building also includes a child minifig and a Lego Store employee minifg. &nbsp;There is also a Lego shipping truck with driver that will be reviewed in a later section. &nbsp;All around I love this building and my only possible complaint is that the otherwise standard street light, lacks the grey vent piece on the 1x2 base that some of the other City sets have.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The Tram station is a glass roofed structure with a couple chairs with side racks to hold newspapers or suitcases. &nbsp;It also includes an electronic ticket dispenser, some nice signage and a grass area with tree to round it out. &nbsp;I like this building, but the tree seems just a bit off. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The tow truck is pretty standard fare with a winch to pull the stranded car up onto the tilting bed. &nbsp;It is&nbsp;done up in the same green and white &quot;Auto Service&quot; colors that the current 60081 Pickup Tow Truck has. &nbsp;Its a nice model that adds some playability to the service station. &nbsp;There are a total of three cars included in this set for the tow truck to tow, a red couple, a black sedan and a yellow pickup truck. &nbsp;All are pretty basic and are of the much maligned 4 stud wide design, but its still a nice bonus and lets you fill up your city streets quick!</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 13.1999998092651px; line-height: 18.4799995422363px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Overall, I love this set, the diversity of buildings, mini-figures, details and accessories provides a ton of play AND display value while still having a fairy solid detail level. &nbsp;The components offer some interplay that gives depth to the whole set and there are lots ways this set can add to a larger city and/or train display! &nbsp;</span></p>

"A_Brickset_user","2015-09-13T17:24:05.837Z","Plenty of Bang for your Buck","<p>I liked the look of this set from the moment I fist laid eyes on it, and having missed out on the first&nbsp;square (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60026-1/Town-Square"">60026</a> Town Square), I was pleased when I saw this and intended to buy it right from the word go.&nbsp;When I finally got round to buying&nbsp;it last week, I was not disappointed.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a fairly standard Lego box, with the main image on the front and details and play features on the back.</p>

<p>There are a whopping 10 instruction books, which announced&nbsp;yed me a little bit, because Lego recently started using one big perfect bound instruction manual for larger sets, and I can&#39;t understand why this set has not been given that special treatment. Book 8 (Which deals with the tram), however, is perfect bound, which only serves to add to the mystery.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t many new parts in this set, with most detailing coming from the three sheets(!) of stickers but&nbsp;there are a few new printed&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;parts.&nbsp;There are, however, four new wheels which are basically a version of the larger type of wheel used on bigger vehicles such as the mixer, except these are to scale with city cars, which is cool.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are a whopping 14 Minifigures, and they are: two children, two Lego employees, a news helicopter pilot, a hot dog guy, a mechanic, a tow truck driver, a car saleswoman, a tram driver, a City Pizza delivery boy, a coffee girl, a green futuron spaceman and a classic knight. There are some cool new printed pieces, and my two personal favourites are the Lego employee shirt and the jacket with City Pizza printed on the back, which is the name of the pizzeria in the previous square set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is an epic build, with 16 bags of a total of 1683 pieces. There are plenty of cool techniques, and it is not&nbsp;repetitive due to the sheer number of different models you have to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model (or models) is a joy to behold, and create a genuinely busy feel. The modern car dealership is an excellent contrast to the more old-fashioned exterior of the Lego store. I initially thought the buildings would be the main attraction to this set, but it is just as much (if not more) the vehicles which have really won me over. It is full of fun little details such as the pick a brick wall, the tiny Lego store bag for minifigs, the&nbsp;bus stop (which is the same as in the Town Square - Thanks for the continuity, Lego!), the bike compartment on the tram (Which really does fit a bike), the car lift, the Coffee Chain stand and so much more. Both large (and both small) buildings are full of detail, with tiny Lego sets, a cash desk a pick a brick wall, two huge Minifigures, and that big red brick they always have in the entrance on the&nbsp;Lego store. The car dealership features sliding windows on the bottom, those new wheels, a fully equipped service centre and car lift and a payment desk. The tram station is also great, with four ticket machines and seats for people to wait in, and the coffee stand has&nbsp;two coffee machines and a nice seating area with a umberella.&nbsp;You also get plenty of vehicles, including three civilian cars, which I have been trying to stock up on, since they&#39;re a refreshing change from the usual police cars and fire engines. The red sporty car is very nice and sleek, and I also like the two-seater black car. The flatbed truck is very nice, with plenty of sticker detailing, as is the tram, with room for 8 minifigs plus 2 drivers. The news helicopter is a great addition too, and certainly goes great with any super heroes stuff as well as city. Overall, there is just a huge amount of great models</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set. It has to be one of my all time favourites, and definitely my favourite&nbsp;City set. It is so packed full of fun and exciting features and the attention to detail is unbelievable. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I&#39;m off to buy Town Square on eBay.</p>

"The_Brick_Guy_87","2016-11-15T17:32:15.97Z","My favorite set that I own so far.","<p>This is my first review, so if you find it unhelpful, please contact me to give me some advice to make better reviews.<br />
<br />
I got this set from my parents for Christmas 2015 (although it didn&#39;t arrive until 3rd of January). When I saw the first pictures I immediately&nbsp;knew I had to get it for my city. Now I am really glad to have it. Read the review to know why.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>With 1683 pieces, it is by far the biggest City set. There are lots of colors (red, orange, dark tan, e.g.). A brick separator is included like most of the huge recent sets. The parts are useful mainly for building a city.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>As expected, the build is extremely long, about 5 hours. The set is split into 16 bags and there are 10 instruction booklets.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>There are 14 minifigs in this set, including the statues in the Lego shop. The torsos of the Lego store employee and truck driver, pizza delivery man, spaceman&nbsp;and coffee seller, along with her legs,&nbsp;are exclusive to this set. A good selection of minifigs, I would say.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Lots of useful parts.</li>
	<li>Very great addition to any city.</li>
	<li>Quite detailed.</li>
	<li>Playability&nbsp;is nearly endless.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The auto dealership is somewhat fragile. If not held right, it can easily fall apart. It is also not very detailed, compared to other components of the set.</li>
	<li>Another red and yellow car. I am annoyed to see that recent civilian City cars are either red or yellow. Can we get new colors, please?</li>
	<li>Finally it is a bit&nbsp;overpriced, even with the large tram windows.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I love this set. It is a must have for any city builder in my opinion. I totally recommend it both for kids and adults. Thanks for taking the time to read my review and I apologize if there are any grammar mistakes. Goodbye for now!</p>
