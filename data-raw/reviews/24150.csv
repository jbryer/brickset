<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a big set so as you&#39;d expect it comes in a big box. The back of the box shows action shots of the various parts of the set, a conductor (not included in the set) shouting Hey! and showing the contents of the box and finally all the Power Function elements.</p>

<p>There are 6 booklets; 2 big ones for the engine and the crane and 4 small ones for each of the cars and the level crossing. With the set aimed at a young audience the instructions are very easy to follow with very few pieces added in each step.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Freight trains are always great parts packs for train builders. Here you get 2 train bases, 8 sets of train wheels, 8 small cross-axle train wheels, 8 buffer beams (2 with snow plough), 4 motor sides, 6 train end fences in yellow and black, an oval of track and of course a full set of Power Functions; a battery box, receiver, train motor and remote control.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a handful of large parts; the train cabins, the windscreens for chopper and crane, the support struts for the crane, the backhoe buckets and the clamshell grabber.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a wide selection of regular and curved slopes in many colours. Many light grey plates and clips, a handful of hidden parts in odd colours like tan bricks with studs on the side, some orange tiles and lime curved slopes.</p>

<p>Then you get some nice details such as a welding kit and other tools, some chains and a few traffic signs.</p>

<p>It has to be mentioned: there&#39;s not a single printed piece in the set but there are 31 stickers, most of them on the engine.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 5 minifigs in the set. There are 2 train staff in the same olive green uniform as seen in the previous freight train and wearing construction helmets, one with hearing protection. There&#39;s a female construction worker in the usual orange outfit with a ponytail under her helmet. Then there&#39;s a guy in a brown jacket with a high-viz vest and finally a traditional handyman in blue dungarees. All minifigs look great with front and back printing and luckily no double-sided heads.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building the various elements of the set keeps you busy for a good while even if no challenging techniques are used. The flat cars are not the most interesting to build but I enjoyed building the brown hopper. The crane too was fun to build with a few clever touches.</p>

<p>Having built 7939 before I definitely had some deja-vu moments building the engine. The bogies are the same, most of the front is the same. The middle section and roof are different though.</p>

<p>The helicopter and backhoe are typical City models, but well designed. Easy enough for young builders and interesting enough for adults.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice freight train, very much European looking with some good play features. It&#39;s hard not to compare it to previous trains, particularly 7393. At first glance the engine may look almost identical but there are some differences. The roof of this one looks better with a bit more interest but the sides are very plain. The suggested walkway along the side doesn&#39;t work for me; visually the offset from the side of the cabin is too subtle and there&#39;s not enough room for a minifig to stand there. Overall a pleasant surprise though after my initial impressions.</p>

<p>The brown hopper is a very nice car, one of the best freight cars in recent years. The flat car with the helicopter has some nice details underneath but the flat car with the backhoe is as plain and boring as they come.</p>

<p>The crane looks great and the trick with the interchangeable hook and grabber is very clever and really adds play value.</p>

<p>The level crossing is very plain and doesn&#39;t really seem to belong with the other elements. That budget could have been better spent, for example on a pair of points/switches and some details on the flat car.</p>

<p>In terms of play elements the set is a bit confusing. The backhoe is cargo for the flat car but also belongs at the cargo station. Or does it? The opening side of the unloading are seems to suggest so but then the crane can also empty that area and... err... put the load back in the train?</p>

<h3>Final Verdict</h3>

<p>I&#39;m giving this set 4 out of 5 in most areas. Mostly a fun set to build, let down by the long flat car. Many play features but a bit confused with the loading and unloading of the hopper. An engine that&#39;s very similar to a set from only a few years ago but just different enough. Pretty good range of parts but really missing those switches.</p>

<p>Very good value for money, especially compared to 60052 which is in the shops at the same time.</p>
