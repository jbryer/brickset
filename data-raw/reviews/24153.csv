"Gerbil","2015-07-05T20:39:01.467Z","The centerpiece of almost any collection.","<p>I had gone into the store with plans to buy the Fairground Mixer. It is $50 cheaper, came out earlier so likely to end production sooner, and was a more typical example of the rides I used to see in my youth. But, upon seeing this set on display, I just had to have it!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Huge of course, and with some&nbsp;fun images on the front and back showing what is going on around the ride. The full set is tough to take a photo of, because the detail is centered along&nbsp;the base of the set, which means the full photos actually can feel a little empty, but there isn&#39;t a lot LEGO could do to mitigate this as it is the nature of the construction.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A reasonable mix, but the main attraction are the new or mostly-new pieces. The yellow and orange trans pieces are beautiful, while the new 6 prong flower pieces are used to create some awesome little trees. There is a lot of repetition of pieces (48 copies of some!) for the main wheel as you&#39;d expect, so if you want these bits for your MOCs and MODs, you are in luck. There&#39;s also quite a lot of icecream pieces which for some reason always cheers me up!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Normally I&#39;d be impressed by 10 different figures, but this set cries out for more, or most of the cars are empty! Despite that, the ones included are nice enough, with a great variety of colours, clothes, hairpieces etc. I am not a minifigure&nbsp;expert by any means so I can&#39;t comment on originality, but the printed torsos are all great. No printed trousers at all though, sadly.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The base is actually quite interesting, and surprised me in several places such as the ramp raising mechanism. It contains less repetition than I&#39;d expected, and some of the mini-builds are great (the ice cream stall is held in place by a tiny flower of all things!). The tree foliage is not fun to do (they require you sticking on 60 flower heads!), but the result is worth it.</p>

<p>There is one part in the instructions I&#39;ve never seen before, which struck me as odd (although necessary). To prevent the walls either side of the ramps causing them to stick, you must simply&nbsp;bend the finished walls outward.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wheel itself though, is hard to describe as anything other than repetitive. Obviously this is down to the nature of the ferris&nbsp;wheel, but I can imagine many people becoming disheartened by the second half of the build. I myself did both sides of the wheel at the same time, and powered through it relatively quickly, but having to find 48 copies of some pieces is always going to be a drag. And until you join the two halves of the wheel, the structures are quite fragile, so expect to have to re-join many bits as you go.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Beautiful and massive. Visually, almost perfect. There&#39;s really nothing more to be said!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Any set that makes the 2012 Town Hall #10224 set look small is clearly going to grab your attention!</p>

<p>The set is beautiful, the mechanisms smooth, and if you can connect it up to a motor, a delight to just relax and watch.&nbsp;<span style=""font-size: 16px;"">The wheel mechanism itself deserves praise. Accurate and with a smoothness I wouldn&#39;t have believed possible given how it works.</span></p>

<div>There are various niggles although some are unavoidable (such as the repetition), but others could have done with a little more investigation - I feel like the set lacked one final revision.<br />
In particular, it is annoying that the cars themselves are just a little too cramped for adult minifigures - they must be placed leaning over drastically, and if they have long hair it can be a real squeeze. It is no coincidence that most of the photos of the cars show them with the kid mini-figures in place.</div>

<p>The mechanism for raising / lowering the ramps can be made to jump a tooth quite easily, so you&#39;ll possibly have to take off, rotate and re-attach the handle occasionally, and the rotating handle area for the main wheel is a bit messy, so that it is power function ready.</p>

<p>However, none of these minor issues are enough to detract from what is undoubtedly a beautiful and enormous set. Even in the largest city layout, this will be a centerpiece that will never get dull.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This is&nbsp; another finely created product from Lego.&nbsp; This is a very challenging build.&nbsp; Most challenging is getting the Ferris Wheel perfectly round.&nbsp; The gondolas actually have doors that open.&nbsp; There is an adjustable platform that allows patrons to enter the gondolas.&nbsp; I motorized this and the motor runs this at a perfect speed.&nbsp; The ice cream stand is a nice feature.&nbsp; Also the turning turnstile is clever. The minifigs are plentiful.&nbsp; This is a fine compliment to the Lego Mixer. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a complicated build with a great reward at the end.</p>

"lentil","2017-01-03T22:04:21.5Z","One of LEGO's all-time best!","<p>Wow, this is the first LEGO set of a more technical nature that I have built, and my family and I were all thoroughly impressed! Beautiful as a display piece, incredibly detailed and fun to play with, clever design, lots of great pieces, ... basically I have nothing negative to say about this one except that the build is a bit challenging and may be too difficult for younger kids.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>There are a whopping 10 minifigs included, which give you a variety of kids and adults, ferris wheel workers, an ice cream seller, and fair patrons. I particularly like the little girl with the dolphins on her shirt, and tough carnie-looking lady with the bandana around her neck :-) Overall it&#39;s a nice assortment that allows you to play with the set even if you don&#39;t have other figs at home who want to go to the fair.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>This was probably the most challenging LEGO build I have done to date. It&#39;s my first foray into the technic area, so my naivete there may have contributed. But some of the steps are truly a bit tricky.</p>

<p>First, the pieces are divided into only 4 numbered sets of bags. (Each number has multiple bags.) For a set that contains almost 2,500 pieces, that means you are going to have to do some serious sorting after opening each bag. The build would have been less tedious if the pieces were broken into 6 or 8 numbered bags, but the repetitiveness of the build probably makes this impossible (see below).</p>

<p>Second, the steps frequently include quite a large number of pieces (20 or more). The new pieces to add are highlighted in yellow on the pictures, but since the set is so large and complex, it often took me several minutes to study the pictures and find all the relevant new pieces to add! Like a major seek and find.</p>

<p>Third, although the instructions were mostly clear, in more than one case the precise positioning of a piece was unclear due to the angle of the illustration. Other pieces sometimes obstruct the view of the new pieces, which are placed to the back. Again, this is because so many pieces are added in one step so there is no one ideal view for all the pieces. Not sure if they were economizing on paper or what here, but breaking the build up into more steps would have avoided some confusion here. I had to look ahead and study other pictures several times to figure out certain details, especially of the base build.</p>

<p>Finally, assembling the wheel itself was pretty tricky. You assemble the spokes one at a time and then connect them, then need to connect the two wheels with multiple cross-beams. There is kind of a chicken and egg moment because in order to snap everything together it all needs to be perfectly aligned, yet to be perfectly aligned it needs to be all snapped together. As I would get one section attached another would pop off, and we kept going around and around like that for a while with more snapping and popping. Eventually though, with a lot of breath-holding, we managed to get it all snapped tight, hooray!</p>

<p>Additionally, there is quite a bit of repetitiveness to the build, since there are of course many identical and symmetrical elements: 12 ferris wheel cars, 8 support posts, 24 wheel spokes, etc. etc. It wasn&#39;t too bad overall because I was excited to get it working, but at times it did feel a bit of a chore. Having multiple people to help out would probably be a great idea :-)</p>

<p>Also I should add that the technic mechanisms are quite complex - it was really interesting to see how it all works!</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>Huge. Breathtaking. Fun. Wowsa. The ferris wheel stands about two feet tall when assembled and makes a striking display. I love the bright colors that were used - the light blue support beams contrast nicely with the yellow and orange star elements at the center. I particularly like the use of trans light blue and orange tiles which twinkle on the wheel like lights - they look great especially if backlit. The brightly colored, saucer shaped ride vehicles are constructed of smooth rounded tile pieces and have front doors that really open.</p>

<p>Of course I knew that the wheel would turn (there is a crank at the back - at minifig level - to operate it), but I was surprised that the loading platform also has a mechanism underneath it. The mechanism is used to raise and lower the loading platform (using a lever). The platform must be lowered so that the wheel can spin unobstructed, and can be raised so that the passengers can board the vehicles easily. Wouldn&#39;t want anyone to have to jump from the platform into a vehicle now, would we? The mechanism that controls this takes up the entire space below the loading platform and is quite complex and clever - I was really impressed that LEGO included this level of realism and detail.</p>

<p>My only slight aesthetic criticism would be that the base of the ferris wheel looks a bit rough and unfinished to me... Although an attempt has been made to shield the innards with a few flowers &amp; co., the mechanical gray and black innards are partially exposed. This might be thought to convey the gritty realism of a real amusement park ride, but I&#39;m not sure I prefer it personally.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This set has tons of fun play features. Of course the platform can be raised and lowered, fair-goers loaded and unloaded into the various vehicles through the moving doors, and the wheel can be cranked around and around. (Note that it is not possible to spin the wheel very quickly though, and it moves in a slightly jerky way which is somewhat awkward.) There is also a turnstile at the entrance to the ride which actually spins as passengers get on, and a cabin for the ride operator with a little seat and computer inside. Additionally, there are fun details on the lawn in front of the ride: my daughter particular likes the little ice cream seller, who has a freezer full of ice cream scoops with a door that opens. There is a queueing ramp, a park bench for spectators to rest on, and a spacious lawn for minifigs to congregate on and discuss their experience.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The price per part is quite good even at full price, considering the amount of pieces and especially the amount of special/technic pieces this comes with. If discounted the ppp approaches phenomenal.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>We could not be more pleased with this set, and hope that LEGO continues to produce sets of this level of quality! This set should have really universal appeal to both adults and kids, boys and girls alike, which I think is really nice to see in this day of &quot;niche&quot; products which seem to pigeon-hole people.</p>

"Legonary","2017-09-08T13:38:09.96Z","Great set","<p>When I first saw pictures of this model I thought: I must have this! So I bought this set quickly after its release.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>The first building steps are very interesting. It&#39;s cool to see how the ground is build part by part. When you come to the upper part, it gets a bit boring. You must build many connection elements for the wheel very often. But when the wheel is finally connected to the lower part, all the frustrating minutes are gone. It was simply amazing to see the hight of this model. The last step was to build the gondolas, this was a bit boring again.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The selection of parts is great. You get many cool minifigures (e.g. a <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/twn244/boy-denim-jacket-light-bluish-gray-short-legs-(10247)"">new head print</a>) and a lot of transparent parts for the wheel.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>You have many functions in this set: openable doors of the gondolas, turning the wheel or lifting up the platform. But sometimes the gondolas touch the platform when turning the wheel.</p>

<p>When you connect a motor (<strong>not included</strong>) as proposed in the building instructions the wheel turns a bit too fast. I&#39;ve connected a train motor (also <strong>not included</strong>) and now I can control the speed of the wheel.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-12-09T06:04:44.533Z","Slogging towards a beautiful result","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This is the second rendition of a ferris wheel, and the first in the so-called Creator Expert-line. And having built it, I agree it is a set for the experts (and hard core Lego enthousiasts). It is also the second set in a line of what&nbsp;hopefully becomes a series of fairground objects (count is up to four so far).</p>

<p>The first sets of bags, building up the base, is fun, but especially the final two groups of bags are a bit of a slog, due to the repetition in the construction. The end result is very impressive, and the set as a whole offers quite a bit of personalization by using other colours, or even adapting the platform.</p>

<p>I like how they already prepared for the integration of a motor, though I think that could have been improved upon; I would go for an adaptation rather than the provided solution. Overall though, this is a good set. I think the overall refular price on the high end. Still, if you come across this set somewhere and it draws your interest, seriously consider picking it up.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Overall this build took me about 6 hours or so. The parts are divided over four groups of bags, numbered 1 through 4.&nbsp;Where with most builds I have a hard time seeing why the age rating is as high as it is, I can see why it is so for this set. There is a lot of repetition, and getting the wheel built and fixed properly is a little tricky; it is prone to coming apart until the two halves are fixed together.</p>

<p>The first part of the build - creating the base and the platform -&nbsp;is quite a bit of fun. The slog starts halfway through group number 2, when you start building the standing supports. From then onwards, there is a lot of repetition, either direct or building a mirror-image: Four stands, the two wheels, twelve cabins. The designers have put in quite a bit of effort to limit the repetition element, but there is only so much one can do. Building the wheel itself is by far the most tricky element. One can build it on its own, but it might help to work with somebody else.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are 10 minifigures in this set, representing all kinds of ages, roles and genders. Two minifigures represent personnel: the female Ice Cream Vendor, and the Ferris Wheel Operator. The rest of the minifigures&nbsp;seem to be&nbsp;customers, two familie groups to be exact: a mom and dad with two kids, and a set of grandparents with their two children. None of the minifigures has a leg print. I generally do like the torso prints. Quite a few faces have alternate prints. Overall, I think the minifigures&nbsp;are (very) well done.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The final result is definitely worth the slog. The whole thing is massive, and when finished, surprisingly steady and sturdy - though not sturdy enough to avoid a Lego&nbsp;explosion when you drop it...</p>

<p>The rotation function works very well, due to the very effective tensioning system. The wheel operates smoothly. So does the system that raises and lowers the platform (and fixes the wheel). The small cabins are that - small, fitting in one, or maybe two minifigures at best. To me, the most enjoyable part - in the end - is the way the geometry works out, and the structural engineering in general. Overall, IMHO the designers have done a great job.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This is mostly a display piece, with a play element. Yes, doors can be opened and the wheel can be rotated, but that is about all play there is to it. It is also very big, needing a lot of space. It will be an eye-catcher as a stand-alone, or incorporated in a bigger display. One could also decide to modify the wheel to fit one&#39;s own taste.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>A superb set, though personally I would rank it as the fourth best set in the four Fairground sets released so far (10224 Fairground Mixer, 10257 Carousel, and&nbsp;10261 Roller Coaster).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is worth its money, and its construction is a nice challenge. Arguably this would be a very good set to build with others. As far as its price goes, I would argue its RRP is acceptable. If you think about getting this set, you would probably have to make a decision fairly quickly, as this set is being retired. And my guess is it will only go up in price in the future.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-05-06T05:38:22.157Z","Fun, Easy, Massive ","<p>When I saw this set used for $100 with a motor I had to jump on it. It is my largest set, but not by much as I own the similarly sized Tower of Orthanc (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10237-1/Tower-of-Orthanc"">10237</a>) and slightly smaller Tantive IV (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75244-1/Tantive-IV"">75244</a>). However,&nbsp;I typically only buy Star Wars sets and have also purchased the entire LOTR/Hobbit line, town sets aren&#39;t really my thing aside from a few very small ones as I had as a kid in the 80&#39;s that have managed to survive until today. So I am very interested to see how much I will enjoy this set, but at the same time I&#39;m hoping the kids will really appreciate it as well.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>Its really hard for me to comment here, obviously the parts in this set are nothing like my usual Star Wars sets although it does have a fair amount of grays. It also has lots of bright colors which I imagine could be very useful for kids. Overall I do t think there is too much variety, just lots of each part. It also contains 5 very large green plates (not baseplates) and 2 more that are half sized that obviously could be incredibly useful in constructing ground, but then again, if you are buying a set like this, aren&#39;t you going to want it to be a Ferris wheel?</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>So I&#39;m not big on generic people and don&#39;t really know what is normally available in typical town settings these days. However, I have to say this is a very nice selection of families, employees, and accessories that make playing with this set rather enjoyable. None of the minifigures are amazing, but they are all very nice and look like normal people. They are all yellow, perhaps a bit of diversity would have been nice, but yellow of course is classic Lego so I can&#39;t really complain.</p>

<p><b>The Build</b></p>

<p>So the first night we opened up we worked on the first bag. Aside from a break for dinner I would say it took about 3 hours to build with the kids helping/playing. This bag builds the base, and while it is almost symmetrical and several times you build a piece twice, it didn&#39;t feel symmetrical. It did feel fragile however, especially a small plate dead smack in the middle, but as you build it up it actually becomes deceptively stable. Near the end of the bag you complete the technic functionality which allows you to raise and lower the platform and eventually spin the Ferris wheel. The technic is the most interesting part of the build as it is the only part that isn&#39;t non-standard stacking in this first bag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second bag starts with the continuation of building the base. But now you are really adding the details. These details which consist of ramps, rails, the ice cream stand, and a bench are pretty simple, in fact my 6 year old built them all without any help. After that you start building the supports which are made up 4 frames, all identical but two of which are mirrored. This is the first taste of repetition you get in the set, not just because you are building 4 and they have 2 sides each, but even the process of lengthening them is repetitive. At the end of the set you build the flowers as well what has to be the most unique part of the build, the trees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 3 is the most interesting where you build the wheel itself. My 6 year old was very intrigued by the technic construction and the geometry it used. But since you have to build 2 he decided we should each build one. I would say he made it through about 75% of the technic build before he lost focus. This part wasn&#39;t too repetitive because each step built outwards, so while you did each task 6 times (x2), each task was unique. It wasn&#39;t until you started to add on the cosmetic details which came in 12&#39;s (x2) that repetition really kicked in. My son started helping again at this point and even he noticed we were doing the same thing 24 times! The good thing is that you start to build it like an assembly line so you can fly through it fairly quickly. The trickiest part of the entire build, and the only justification for the 16+ age suggestion, is attaching the two wheels which takes a good amount of precision and my 6 year old helped me a lot at ensuring all the axles lined up. I would say bags 2 and 3 maybe took a combined 2.5 hours, although my son did help a lot with bag 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I was working&nbsp;my son decided to take on bag 4 by himself and enlisted the help of his 3 year old sister. In this bag you are building the 12 cars/gondolas that you ride inside of. Well this is not a set for 3 year olds, but despite her building everything wrong my son still managed to build most of the bag, pretty much everything but the roofs by the time I was able to help him. I&#39;m not quite sure how long he spent building, but I would think that an hour would be more than enough time to assemble this bag as building each car itself has quite a bit of repetition and you do it 12 times. This is also probably the simplest part of the entire build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a very simple and surprisingly quick build. The repetition means that you don&#39;t have a very small variety of pieces that you can quickly sort through. Many of the pieces are quite large, and there are no similar sized parts of the same color. That said, it was enjoyable and rewarding as you see this massive construction come together. However, it simply doesn&#39;t have the complexity of a Star Wars set that is only half its size. Furthermore, the techniques used aren&#39;t revolutionary but more of a study of Lego geometry.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;The Model</b></p>

<p>You will not be disappointed with the finished model. It is massive and looks amazing. The wheel itself seems a little fragile, but it was able to take a fair amount of abuse from my 3 and 6 year olds. The base isn&#39;t the prettiest, especially near the mechanics, but it is acceptable. In fact It does seem very true to an amusement park aside from the very short line, and I imagine the mechanics of a real Ferris wheel would be quite ugly. But the wheel itself is truly amazing and the color scheme looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>Well this is where the set really succeeds. There aren&#39;t enough minifigures to fill the Ferris wheel but luckily that isn&#39;t too big a problem. My son simply told his stormtroopers that weapons weren&#39;t allowed on the ride, and not only did they agree, but so did the Empororer and Darth Vader! The set has two main functions. The obvious one is rotating the wheel, but the other is raising the platforms so you can load 3 cars at once, which also acts as a parking brake. The wheel spins both ways. The doors to each car open. You have a turnstile and an ice cream stand to complete the scene. The kids couldn&#39;t possibly be having more fun with it... or could they?</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;The Power Function&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>I don&#39;t own the power function set that Lego recommends, meaning the battery pack can&#39;t be attached to the base as suggested much to my son&#39;s disappointment. However our motor attaches in the same exact way, plus we have two lights. I borrowed a few bricks from other sets to attach the lights so they illuminate the wheel, although I&#39;ve ordered some parts to do a better job of angling them correctly. If you want to know what is more fun than running a Ferris wheel by hand, it is using power to do it, and then switching off between power and manual. Even better is at night when you turn off the lights and use the lights from the power function to create awesome shadows on the wall that are perfect for a dance party!</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Everything about this set is exactly what I expected, although I was amazed at how much of it my 6 year old was able to do on his own. I highly recommend this set as it is really a great set for kids to play with, and they can build it very quickly. It also looks great and will be a family favorite for a long time to come. My son only wishes that we could shrink down to Lego size to go on it ourselves!</p>
