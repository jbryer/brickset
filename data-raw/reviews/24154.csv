"pagani88","2015-08-09T21:19:01.87Z","THE supercar ","<p>I bought this set the day after it came out, instead of buying the Jurassic world set, t rex tracker. So, does it live up to expectations?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>In the middle of the box is one of the most flattering images of the F40. On the right side is the new creator expert logo, the Ferrari badge and some smaller Images of the car. On the left side is the parts count, set name, set number, and recommended age. The back has the rear view of the car and some pictures of the model&#39;s display features. The instructions have 140 pages, cover to cover, and on the front are the same images as the front of the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>According to the front of the box, 1158 pieces here. Many are red slopes and tiles, and there are a fair few technic pieces too. The wheel hubs are new, and very true to the real one with the classic Ferrari star shape. The pieces for the C-pillars are red prints on black pieces. (6108764 and 6108748). The windscreen is, like the wheel hubs, a brand new piece and will be very very useful for cars mocs. But only red ones, because it is printed with red pillars on the sides. It is the perfect shape for an F40.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None here at all!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is long, perfect for an &pound;80 set. It is very interesting and fun to see the car coming together and to see how they got the shapes just right. It can be quite annoying trying to find parts, because all the bags are numbered either 1 or 2, so you&#39;re looking through about 50% of the parts at one time. So I would advise you to spread the parts out over a very large space!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Fantastic. I don&#39;t think the F40 Is particularly pretty, (not that I think it&#39;s ugly) but it looks great in bricks! It has 14 stickers, but they are needed. The interior is suitably spartan for the F40, and looks just right. The engine is so detailed, and the fact that it can be removed is just great. The slopes and curves are very well done, along with all the intakes. The pop up headlights are well hidden, but not too well. It&#39;s playability is pretty good too, kids can open the front, doors and back up to see the seats, engine and empty spare wheel holder! This is great, considering it is for display.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set really is great. Please buy it if you are a car fan. If not, then it isn&#39;t a MUST buy, but I recommend you do so. Very good set, and yes, I think it does live up to expectations.</p>

"zanthrax","2016-08-05T15:38:46.07Z","Great representation of an iconic car","<p>I&#39;m not a fan of Ferrari&#39;s, but the F40 is an exception. It&#39;s looks appear to be dictated by it&#39;s function instead of overdone Italian design. It&#39;s somewhat blocky design without compound curves lends itself very well to Lego.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Compared to the VW van and Beetle and the Mini the box for this set is a bit bland. It shows off the model nicely but the lack of scenery makes it stand out from other large scale car sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not many specialized parts here, the wheel inserts will look great on many other cars and the new windshield piece should also help on a lot of MOCs, as long as they are red.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This sets features a lot of nice SNOT building. The angle on the vents behind the doors are achieved with a simple and effective construction.<br />
The hood in particular is a very nice design, there are a few plates on the inside on SNOT connectors to make it very sturdy and the way the sloping center section snaps into place is outright genius, double so since the same simple construction also holds the brick-built hood vents in place.<br />
The louvres in the rear glass are a must have for this model and they are nicely done. A lot of the rear window is actually black bricks but that&#39;s not very noticeable in the resulting model.<br />
I had a little trouble telling dark grey apart from black but most of the times this sets does not have the piece you&#39;re looking for in both those colors.<br />
Overall the build is enjoyable, there are plenty of interesting techniques used without anything being hard to figure out.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The result of this kit is immediately recognizable. All important details for this car are included.<br />
The large opening covers in the front and rear are large but strongly built.<br />
My only minor complaint it that there is no spare wheel under the front hood.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fun build resulting in a pretty model. A must buy for any car fanatic.</p>

"Sethro3","2017-08-28T16:29:56.59Z","Another iconic car immortalized in LEGO","<p>I hemmed and hawed over this vehicle for a while. In my youth I liked the &quot;old school&quot; Lamborghini and Ferrari, but did I want one in LEGO format? I finally found it on a good sale, so I decided to bite the bullet. Does it live up to the expectations as the other Creator cars LEGO has produced? We will find out..</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Good scale. It captured a lot of the right details at this size.</p>

<p>- Clever build techniques with plenty of SNOT building on the inside. That is an area I&#39;m not super familiar with, but flipping through the instructions on sets like this help me understand that style. And it pays off in the end.</p>

<p>- The rear louvered window is cleverly built, even though surprisingly a lot more solid bricks are used.</p>

<p>- Having a built engine is always neat, especially at this scale. I don&#39;t know a lot about engines, but I was pleased to see this.</p>

<p>- Pop up headlights is a clever feature that blends in quite well. I didn&#39;t know they were there at first.</p>

<p>- Allows you to open doors, rear hood, and front hood. You can flip forward the front windshield to see the interior easier.</p>

<p>- I really like how they incorporated the black line along the side, even though stickers had to be used in a small portion.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- Fragile! I realize this might be more of a display piece, but handling it to show people or to put it on a shelf seemed to have very limited areas you could hold. It was claimed to have easy removal of the engine, but I had a heck of a time getting that out of there without the whole rear crumbling. Thankfully with some of the technic joints it is easy to reassemble, but shouldn&#39;t be necessary. I was not impressed with durability.</p>

<p>- Stickers. While necessary quite often, in a large Exclusive set like this, I would expect more printing. There is a printed windshield and rear wedge for the canopy.</p>

<p>- I like the ability to open the many compartments, but they don&#39;t seem to sit flush when trying to put them back down.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>In the end, I would say this is a fun display piece. It has over 1000 pieces and sits at around $100. Pretty average, however, as stated above I waited for a decent sale. I sat on the idea of owning this over multiple holidays/birthdays, but at the right price I&#39;m glad I found it. I would recommend picking it up if you are into the Creator car series or Ferraris. This isn&#39;t my favorite of the Creator series, but it is a great display set either way.</p>

"Wom","2016-01-07T14:56:12.697Z","An '80s kid dream set? ","<p>If you grew up in the 80s there was one iconic supercar which stood above all others: the Ferrari F40. The Italian carmaker created a car which still appeals to a lot of people, even today. Does the model still appeal so much translated into a Lego set, knowing the high standards we came to expect from Lego?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing you notice when you have the box in front of you is the lack of added graphics. The &#39;less = more&#39; concept works well, as the red F40 directly catches your attention. Next to different photos of the model there is also a picture of the actual car. Just as you would expect to be honest. Once you opened the box you will see several numbered bags and the detailed build instructions. The different steps in the booklet are clearly described but I had some troubles with the difference between the dark grey and the black bricks. The instructions also advertise for the Mini Cooper, a model you could label as being part of the same series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actual build is one of the better ones I&#39;ve experienced. There is little to no repetitivness and there are some really smart techniques used to create the iconic shape of the F40. The designers receive bonus points for the minibuild of the V8 engine. The engine is easily removable from the car and can be used to display as a seperate piece. I sure hope that with future cars Lego tries to do the same. Think about the Porsche 911 with his flat-head 6-cyl engine or the V10 from a Dodge Viper. This definately adds to the attractivness of this set for a gear head like myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lego introduces a couple of new bricks specific for this car. So is the windscreen (with red prints on the sides) a debutant as are the rims, which match the rims of the original one. As any car enthousiast would know, the wheels make the car! Next to the rear window Lego has &#39;cheated&#39; with a printed brick to simulate the C-style connecting the roof with the engine cover. An understandable choice, but also the least attractive part of the car if you ask me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you completed the build (it took me about four hours in total) and compare it to the real car you notice that Lego did a very nice job capturing this Italian supercar. The proportions of the model look very much alike. Just the back side is bit more bulky than the real deal, as the spoiler lacks the small bend the original has. But overall there is not much to complain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you pick up the F40 you notice that it&#39;s a really solid build. Thanks to the construction of the roof the car is easy to pick up without any parts flying off. Although I do think this set will be used as a showcase model in most cases. The lack of steering prevents a large portion of the playability. But with the doors which can open, the engine cover which can be lifted and the trunk (including accesoiries) which also opens there are plenty of options to display this car in a nice way. Just as the original, Lego provided a small beam to keep the engine cover lifted. Those are the kind of details I like.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all I think Lego did a great job with this set. It&#39;s enjoyable to build and the end results is a great looking car which works great as a display set. Can&#39;t wait to see which iconic car Lego will choose next.&nbsp;</p>

"omnius","2019-04-24T00:40:33.263Z","An iconic car","<p>There can&#39;t be many people who wouldn&#39;t recognise a Ferrari F40, especially if they grew up in the 1980s. Even if they aren&#39;t immediately familiar with the name they&#39;ll know this iconic car, built by Ferrari betwee 1987 and 1992.</p>

<p>LEGO have long enjoyed a partnership with Ferrari, and the F40 is arguably one of the best sets produced. The build is intricate without being overly complicated, with some very clever building techniques to faithfully recreate the F40&#39;s angles while also being largely stud-less. The car has a detailed interior with opening doors, while opening the rear reveals a detailed representation of the twin-turbocharged engine. Similarly the front opens to reveal the boot.</p>

<p>Of the parts in the car, special mention has to be given to the windscreen - part &#39;Wind Screen 1X12X4 54 Deg&#39;. This part was first introduced with the F40, and allows the car to be faithfully represented at an impressive scale without a full windscreen. The part is useful for MOC cars as long as they&#39;re red, as the part has printed red frames on either side. Despite this printed part, much of the car&#39;s detail comes in the form of stickers.</p>

<p>While primarily intended as a (stunning) display piece, the car features some play features, mainly the opening doors outlined above. The build itself is so sturdy you could carry the car by its roof without it breaking off.</p>

<p>In all, the F40 is a highly recommended purchase for fans of classic cars, Ferrari&nbsp;or just intricate, detailed builds.</p>
