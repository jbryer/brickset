I have always been a&nbsp;fan of Asian architecture&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Ninjago theme, and was&nbsp;ecstatic when I found out that the two would finally be coming together into one giant modular.&nbsp;It had tons of minifigures, lots of&nbsp;cool pieces,&nbsp;and the overall model looked amazing...but it was $200, quite a lot for a high school student saving up for college like myself.&nbsp;I was determined though, and over the next month I sold over $400 dollars worth of LEGO&#39;s and other items on Ebay to make sure that I could buy The Temple of Airjitzu&nbsp;as soon as possible. And then&nbsp;one day I&nbsp;happened to come across a&nbsp;great deal for it,&nbsp;and soon the set&nbsp;was mine before it was even available to VIP&#39;s!&nbsp;I couldn&#39;t believe my good fortune&nbsp;when it arrived on a Saturday as well, giving me two whole days to build before the school week started, and many more after&nbsp;that to write a review here.&nbsp;So,&nbsp;enjoy this earlier than normal analysis, and&nbsp;most importantly enjoy&nbsp;building!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Best. Box. Ever. Seriously, this&nbsp;is one of the greatest&nbsp;we&#39;ve ever seen. The front design&nbsp;is an artistic masterpiece, completely abandoning the same old&nbsp;repetitive banner and instead&nbsp;going all out out with fireworks, distant mountains, and a beautiful sunset. The back, while not as detailed, is incredibly organized, and features a number of different set pictures categorized&nbsp;by building, along with a pictorial list of minifigures at the bottom. As for the instructions&nbsp;there is no lack of&nbsp;detail in there as well, with a few pages being devoted entirely to Asian architecture itself,&nbsp;and as to&nbsp;what&nbsp;inspired this set. This is a great touch that we don&#39;t see very often, and I think it fits&nbsp;perfectly here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get SO many parts in this set (2028, to be exact), and the majority of them are exclusive, have exclusive printing, or are just plain cool. One of the things that really caught my attention when I saw the pictures was the shadow theater, which uses a very rare light brick to achieve it&#39;s effect, as well as two red trophy&nbsp;pieces. I&#39;ll leave you to find out how this play feature is activated, but I will tell you that it&#39;s a very ingenious design. Also included in the massive piece pile are four&nbsp;garage doors, which actually serve as the roof for the smuggler&#39;s market. They fit quite perfectly and just create an awesome look to the whole model. Other notable pieces include the printed rice paper windows and doors, gray dragon statues, olive green grass stalks,&nbsp;orange and brown leaf pieces,&nbsp;sand green bricks, and various minifigure accessories.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are so many minifigures in this set&nbsp;that I can&#39;t possibly talk about&nbsp;them all and not get repetitive, so instead I&#39;m going to split them into three&nbsp;groups: the&nbsp;Repeats, the Re-printed, and the Exclusive&#39;s. One thing I should mention is that there is technically another minifigure&nbsp;not included in the official number, and serves as a statue centerpiece for the main build. It is supposedly Sensei Yang, but you can just as well imagine it as Sensei Wu, or anyone else&nbsp;really. I&#39;ll get more into him&nbsp;a bit later.</p>

<p><strong>The Repeats (Kai, Zane, Cole, Jay, Lloyd, Nya)</strong></p>

<p>All the ninjas are here&nbsp;in one&nbsp;set, something that hasn&#39;t happened since 2012&#39;s Ultra Sonic Raider,&nbsp;and I don&#39;t even count that one&nbsp;since Nya was absent. But seriously, this is one of the details that will make this set sell. There&#39;s no need anymore to&nbsp;buy&nbsp;a singular set for ONE rare ninja&nbsp;just to sell everything else,&nbsp;and no need to buy them&nbsp;online either.&nbsp;The Airjitzu&nbsp;Temple has got&nbsp;you covered.</p>

<p><strong>The Re-printed (Sensei Wu, Dareth)</strong></p>

<p>There are only two minifigures in this set that aren&#39;t exclusive but DO have exclusive printing: Wu and Dareth. Wu has appeared in many&nbsp;sets over the years&nbsp;in many&nbsp;different variations,&nbsp;including Master Wu (70734 Master Wu Dragon)&nbsp;and Evil Wu (70725 Nindroid Mechdragon), but looks the&nbsp;best&nbsp;here in his golden&nbsp;oriental robes.&nbsp;Dareth&nbsp;on the other hand&nbsp;makes only&nbsp;his&nbsp;second appearance,&nbsp;sporting a newer version of&nbsp;his signature&nbsp;gold chain, brown robes, and&nbsp;glossy hair.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Exclusives (Postman, Misako, Jasper, Claire)</strong></p>

<p>First of all, I could do without Jasper and Claire. But in reality, there&#39;s really no one else that they&nbsp;can add, since they basically put EVERY single protagonist character from the cartoons into this set, save for a couple of exceptions (such as Garmadon, who is basically&nbsp;trapped in Ninjago&#39;s&nbsp;version of hell, and Cyrus Borg, who appears occasionally but would just look out of place here). They&#39;re still really cool figures anyway,&nbsp;and who knows, they could be&nbsp;important in the cartoon. The other two, Misako and the Postman, are what really caught everyone&#39;s eye however. Misako FINALLY gets to appear in a set for the very first time, and&nbsp;the addition of the comedic&nbsp;Postman is a tiny detail that I don&#39;t&nbsp;think&nbsp;a lot of people&nbsp;realized they wanted, but immediately knew that they in fact did&nbsp;once he was revealed. These two will definitely be selling&nbsp;at high prices&nbsp;on the secondary market, so getting them both in this set is a big win.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Although there were a couple of tedious moments (building the rooftops for the center building became pretty repetitive), putting this set together was a blast, ans there are SO many models!&nbsp;You start with the Smugglers&#39;&nbsp;market and then the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop, which both connect to the main model using basic technic pins. The market is sort of actually two buildings, connected by the roof pieces, while the blacksmith&rsquo;s shop uses fun SNOT methods to achieve the unique texture of its walls. Next,&nbsp;we build the actual Airjitzu temple itself, the biggest and most advanced of all the models. It consists of a mountainous bottom (where the shadow theater is), three floors, a roof, and two pairs of curved steps on either&nbsp;side of a brightly colored fountain, which is where the Sensei Yang minifigure is positioned. The bridge is the last model to be&nbsp;built,&nbsp;and sits between the two smaller buildings in the front, but does not actually connect to them. Instead, a clever building technique is used so that when placed the bridge can be lifted but not moved to the left or right.&nbsp;Two mini-models are&nbsp;included as well:&nbsp;a old fashioned glider, which is a great&nbsp;nod to LEGO&#39;s retired&nbsp;ninja theme, and a flashy fireworks cart, equipped with a loaded stud cannon and plenty of extra&nbsp;&quot;fireworks&quot;.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>To make this section just a little bit easier to read I&#39;ve split it up by model, so that each build gets a paragraph of it&#39;s own. We&#39;ll start with the smaller ones, and then&nbsp;lead up to the temple.</p>

<p><strong>Fireworks cart</strong></p>

<p>Made&nbsp;of just over ten&nbsp;pieces, the fireworks cart is small, but very effective and a lot of fun. It&#39;s basically a rick shack with a cannon pointed&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;signify&nbsp;fireworks being shot into the sky. Kids will have a blast with this one&nbsp;for sure, but moms and vacuums won&#39;t. Luckily the set has includes&nbsp;two extra pieces of each color...so that they&nbsp;can get lost too.</p>

<p><strong>Glider</strong></p>

<p>Although I&#39;m not old enough to have had an opportunity to buy&nbsp;a set from the old Castle sub-theme&nbsp;Ninja line, I&#39;m sure adults will recognize the nearly&nbsp;identical recreation of their classic flying machine. The first time I saw it I thought it looked stupid, and truthfully it does look a little&nbsp;old-fashioned. But that&#39;s exactly what its purpose is, to look older than everything else,&nbsp;and its certainly a nice&nbsp;&quot;blast from the past&quot; moment for longtime&nbsp;fans&nbsp;of the theme.</p>

<p><strong>The bridge</strong></p>

<p>The final model that you build is in my opinion one of the best parts of the set. I&#39;ve&nbsp;always wanted a Japanese-style bridge in LEGO form, and now I&#39;ve got exactly that and more. With&nbsp;a good number of rare colors and pieces it stands out more than it was expected to, and really&nbsp;provides&nbsp;an awesome&nbsp;final touch to an already amazing scene.</p>

<p><strong>Smugglers&#39;&nbsp;Market</strong></p>

<p>Oh my gosh, those are sand green bricks. My favorite LEGO color of all time, but also one of the rarest colors of all time. Seriously, the Smugglers&#39;&nbsp;Market isn&#39;t in any previous sets, or the cartoons, so they could have basically chosen any color they wanted to, such as brown or black. But instead they chose sand green, which, regardless of&nbsp;the fact that it&#39;s my favorite, was the best color they could have used. It perfectly contrasts with the similarity sized blue and brown blacksmith, and the tan ground underneath. Inside&nbsp;the shop there are&nbsp;many different items for sale, including bread, fish, apples, and cookies. There&#39;s also&nbsp;yet&nbsp;another tribute to the theme&#39;s previous years included as well,&nbsp;two 1x2 tiles printed to look like the old trading cards from the 2011-2012 sets.</p>

<p><strong>Blacksmith&#39;s Shop</strong></p>

<p>Easily the most creative building I&#39;ve ever put together, the blacksmith&#39;s shop makes up for what it doesn&#39;t have in rare bricks by giving us some really cool&nbsp;SNOT techniques and a cleanly designed roof. The anvil in the center of the first floor is pretty cool too, built out of just&nbsp;five pieces but looking just like an anvil should.&nbsp;There are a couple of minor problems with this one though,&nbsp;starting with the second floor, which has literally nothing in it. It&#39;s certainly&nbsp;large enough&nbsp;to fit a mini-model in there, so why they didn&#39;t include a small bed or at least a couple boxes to build up&nbsp;the piece count is beyond me. Secondly, we need to talk about the trees. There trunks are THREE different colors, specifically black and two shades of brown. I don&#39;t know why they decided to do this, but it looks lazy and just downright wrong, like a kid who didn&#39;t have enough pieces to build a proper tree. The blacksmith shop is still easily&nbsp;a good addition to the set overall, and contributes&nbsp;in as many ways as possible, even with the&nbsp;camo&nbsp;trees.</p>

"MetroiD","2018-07-10T15:00:49.23Z","The marriage of wabi-sabi and ABS couldn't be more perfect","<p>First things first: I&#39;m not a fan of Ninjago. Or rather, wasn&#39;t. It&#39;s not that I hold any grudges against one of LEGO&#39;s most successful recent themes, it just didn&#39;t really seem to lend itself too well to recreating landscapes, architecture or real life scenes.</p>

<p>Enter the Temple of Airjitzu. And then exit (through the gift shop) - since I somehow managed to let this one slip when it was still available in stores. To add insult to injury, I did see it live and get a peek at some of its features - but figured that a) it would just stand out too much and be very hard to combine with other sets / MOCs; and b) open-back sets are just not particularly interesting to AFOLs.</p>

<p>In dealing with the a) (non-)issue, over the last few years Ninjago seems to be the theme with some of the most amazing and complex sets: and, if not Ninjago City, then the Docks would look beautifully alongside this - and other - temple(s). And in terms of b) - I readily admit that I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong. The Airjitzu Temple&#39;s open back and the opportunity to peek inside, move things around and, of course, enjoy the delightfully simple yet absolutely exquisite shadow theatre is essential.</p>

<p>In trying to keep this review uncharacteristically brief, I&#39;d like to focus on this set&#39;s uber-LEGO merits: yes, the parts assortment is amazing, the architecture is beyond gorgeous, the building&nbsp; techniques applied are smart and/or outright eye-opening. But what really took me by surprise here was the presentation. The stories that set the tone at the start of the instruction manual are a reflection of the set creator&#39;s palpable desire to convey not just a narrative, but also a whole philosophy in bricks. In effect, this has now opened my eyes to the fact that Ninjago is not just a martial arts theme, but also where zen melts into plastic. To me, this set&#39;s greatest victory is its intent on focusing on imperfections and recreating reality - Ninjago&#39;s world might be full of spinjitzu, airjitzu and otherjitzu (forgive me for being crude here), but it&#39;s also able to acknowledge and enjoy transience and imperfection.</p>

<p>Having said that, from a LEGO perspective, there&#39;s very few things that are imperfect with the Temple of Airjitzu and its immediate surroundings. To this day, it is one of the sets with the best &quot;landscaping&quot;, even if that is achieved in a fittingly minimalistic way. Speaking of which - I found it remarkable how this set&#39;s finishing touches - the bridge, the fireworks cart, or even the centerpiece lake and statue - are all highly functional and beautifully looking, yet are created with a rather simple build. Once again, a nod to the &quot;uber-LEGO&quot; merits of this set in proving that often times less is more.</p>

<p>If you need an excuse to get acquainted with LEGO&#39;s most acclaimed theme of the last few years, or would like physical proof as to just how ABS plastic could become art, look no further.</p>
