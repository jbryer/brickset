I Saw That Guy in The Movie For Three Seconds!","<p>When I was first sent the postcard from Lego reminding me of the May 4th sales, I was really kind of disappointed by the exclusive minifigure they were giving out this year. &nbsp;Although Admiral Yularen did play a big role in the Clone Wars TV show, he is only in the original trilogy for a couple of seconds, during the famous&nbsp;Death Star meeting in Episode IV. &nbsp;I originally wasn&#39;t going to try to reach the $75 in order to get him for free, but realizing how close I was to $75 anyway, I caved in and bought the Shadow Troopers Battlepack to compensate.</p>

<h3>The completed minifigure</h3>

<p>This minifigure matches the source material to the T. &nbsp;If you go on wookieepedia.com, as I&#39;m sure many of you Star Wars fans do, you can see a picture of Yularen during A New Hope, and he is very well replicated in this minifigure.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When compared to the other exclusive minifigures that I own, such as Darth Revan, this was probably one of the least interesting ones. &nbsp;It&#39;s not like Yularen was ever in any big action scenes or battles, so kids are definitely not going to know who he is. &nbsp;Luckily, my Death Star Conference Room has been dying for more Imperial officers, so Yularen did end up finding a home. &nbsp;I wish Lego had made a better choice though, such as Commander Cody, the bartender from A New Hope, or Aunt Beru. &nbsp;However, it was free, and that should be good enough for anybody.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Very accurate to source material</p>

<p>Free!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Not instantly recognizable</p>

<p>Dozens of other far more interesting options</p>
