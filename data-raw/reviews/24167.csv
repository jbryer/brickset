"Broken_Cheese_Slope","2015-11-28T22:20:47.347Z","Minifigure Cube","<p>When I first heard that Target was doing the same promotion as last year I had to buy this set. To get this set you could buy it for $10 (down from $15 last year)&nbsp;or get one for free by spending $50 on selected LEGO items. The cube comes with 4 detailed exclusive minifigures (Kai from Ninjago, Healed Sir Fangar&nbsp;from Chima, a City Scuba Diver, and Lighting Lad from DC Superheroes). Now, the box.</p>

<p><strong>Box</strong></p>

<p>The box is nearly the same as the one from last year. Each side has a view of the pre-built minifigure and is decorated with scenery&nbsp;from each theme. The Ninjago side is decorated with a mist covered landscape. Lightning Lad&#39;s side has Metropolis (or is it Gothom?) at dusk. I am not sure why the Superman &quot;s&quot; is on this side. The Chima side has the ice covered outlands. City&#39;s side shows a cross view of the ocean.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kai</strong></p>

<p>Kai&#39;s hair and scarf where both introduced in 2014 so they aren&#39;t exclusive to this figure. I think that both Kai&#39;s head and sword holder where both used on Lloyd last year. His torso is similar to the ninga&nbsp;wraps of last year which have an armor hanging by fabric look. His back carries over the same design. The one con it that Kai&#39;s fire logo doesn&#39;t match up with the hole in the sword holder like the ZX ninja&#39;s did.&nbsp;His leg print&nbsp;features a normal Ninjago ninja tunic belt print.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Lightning Lad</strong></p>

<p>Lightning Lad is the most detailed of the cube. He uses an amazing double sided face which shows lighting going out of his eyes with an angry expression. His left arm uses a tattoo that looks like an &quot;l&quot; in a golden circle with a dot on a far side with black lighting coming out of it. His torso has the same symbol on his belt. His torso is printed with blue black and white spandex. He has back printing that shows his back with two belt pockets. His legs have a lightning design that carries over to the sides.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sir Fangar</strong></p>

<p>Like last year&#39;s Lavertus, Sir Fangar&#39;s dark blue cape was completely crumpled in the box. Fangar uses the a normal animal head for him which is white with teeth printing. Under that he has a single sided head (a strange thing for Chima) that&nbsp;has orange eyes and fur detailing. His torso has bronze armor with chi in it and fur detailing. This carries onto the back. The legs have a dark blue belt with fur leg detailing and clawed feet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Scuba Diver</strong></p>

<p>The scuba divers&#39;s blue helmet and trans light blue mask are both common. I do think his head is new. It features brown bushy eyebrows with a small brown beard. Also printed are light orange cheek bones. The scuba diver has a great torso with printed short sleeves and a cool scuba suit. His vest is continued on the back which also has an anchor logo. His pants have blue markings that are continued on the sides.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>*Cheap</p>

<p>*4 Exclusive figs</p>

<p>**Detailing is great</p>

<p>*Great gift for kids or collectors</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>*Less pieces than last year</p>

<p>*Kai&#39;s back print allinement</p>

<p>*Fangar&#39;s&nbsp;Cape</p>

<p>*A con some might find is that they are pre-built.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Down from $15 last year, I think this box is an amazing deal to get 4 great figures. I do suggest you get if if you can spare $10 or can pick it up by spending $50.</p>

<br />
Getting an extra of Kai is a bit redundant if you&#39;ve been collecting Ninjago. Same with Sir Fangar for Legends of Chima.<br />
<br />
The Scuba Diver has some use depending on what the focus of a City collection is.<br />
<br />
For me, the biggest draw is getting Lightning Lad who is unique to this set for the DC collectors.</p>

<p>Otherwise this set isn&#39;t going to offer much outside of adding more figures to a collection..<br />
