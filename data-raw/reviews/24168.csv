<p>the polybag&nbsp;was easy to open. The instructions were easy to follow aswell, the instgructions&nbsp;also came folded (like all poly bag sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>the parts are just basic city parts nothing new.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>the minifig is ok has a plain face with grin. the torso has back printing. the pants have no printing just plain orange.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the build took less then 10 minutes maybe less but it was easy. I&#39;d give the build 4.8/5</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>the completed set is an average polybag set city wise. this set has a good selection of hinges. so not a bad set i say</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>after the build and tand the (hopefully exclusive minifgure) witch was the main reason i got this set it deserves a 4.5/5, also for those of you wonder I got this off of a online seller rather then wasteing&nbsp;$35dollars on sets i dont want just to get a $4 sett</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:40:53.42Z","Time For Demolition!","<p><strong>Set # 30312 Demolition Driller: </strong>Construction based Polybags are often rare, mostly because there are only so many vehicles you can make out of a Polybag. Read the pros and cons of this little set and then the overall thoughts to find out if you should track this one down.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>A few unique pieces are included in this set, among them is the ice cream cone piece in black, making this a great little parts pack for that piece alone.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price-per-piece ratio is fine.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model is fast and quick to build.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model looks strange and is relatively limited in design, use of 2x6 brick for the base reminds me of juniorization designs from the early 2000s.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Minifigure is identical to many LEGO Construction workers, doesn&rsquo;t stand out and accessory choices are very strange, with a detached saw blade and a robot hand used I think for a wrench.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Not a fan of this one honestly, the biggest draw for this set is the black ice cream cone piece for MOC fans, the model uses too few pieces for my liking and the Minifigure isn&rsquo;t much to talk about either. As a free promotional set, which was the case for me, I can&rsquo;t really say it&rsquo;s too bad, however I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend hunting it down and spending more than its worth. Skip it without concern.</p>
