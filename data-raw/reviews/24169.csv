<p>The minifigs are of a reasonable standard, although a reversible facial expression on the unfortunate ACU operative would have been nice.&nbsp; A transformation from cool, calm and collected to screaming terror is always more entertaining than permanent terror!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pteranodon is Lego&#39;s best effort to date at this particular creature, with a similar design but better colouring than the Dino version from several years back (let us never speak of the Dino Attack technicolor monstrosity from the early 2000s).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chopper itself suffers from Lego&#39;s worst tail rotor design in living memory and, as the official Brickset review has pointed out, would have been far better served by a shielded fan or even a NOTAR-style vent. &nbsp;Apart from that lapse, the overall chopper is a reasonable representation and the build is quite entertaining, with good use of SNOT to make the side panels for the helicopter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MASSIVE net launcher on the left side of the chopper&nbsp;is also&nbsp;unrealistic, but to see this launcher wielded by a small person is to see how much play value is added to the set through its inclusion (although capturing the cat has yet to succeed).&nbsp; It even seems to outstrip the flick fire launcher on the other side of the chopper for fun value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very enjoyable set for small people at a relatively low price point.&nbsp;</p>

Read on to discover if this set is worth picking up or not.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box/Instructions</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: Pteranodon Capture is the smallest set in the Theme and Jurassic World has included a uniform box design that matches up slightly with the Hasbro toyline. The colouring and the placement of the logo is fairly standard, similar to how Star Wars is treated.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The unique elements are the LEGO T-Rex in the upper corner and the fun action scenes of the contents depicted on the front and back of the box. With a nice background shot of Isla Nublar. Overall a good design that grabs your eye, especially with the scaled look of a dinosaur, specifically the Indominous if I&rsquo;m not mistaken all over the box.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: A single manual is used for this set and that&rsquo;s fine. You&rsquo;ll find the build broken up between two numbered bags and each has easy to follow steps. There will be stickers used for details which is what I&rsquo;ve come to expect for most Licensed Themes with unique logos and markings, as the sets themselves have very limited re-use potential for any printed elements. In the back is a checklist of all the Minifigures and Dinosaurs, except for those found in the Wal-Mart exclusive set. You&rsquo;ll also find a parts list naturally, plus a fun little comic tale of the Indominus breaking out.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As this is your standard LEGO Helicopter design there aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of parts to discuss here. The biggest attraction in this category is the large number of darker blue elements that aren&rsquo;t found very often. Strange as that may sound I don&rsquo;t believe we see that many elements in this colour, so you&rsquo;re going to enjoy the cheap method of acquiring those elements. The medium stone grey landing struts for the copter are also a great part and very versatile for MOC fans I&rsquo;m certain.</span></span></span></span></p>

They also share accessories for the most part with this one coming with the tranquilizer gun and dart this helps to have all of them be uniform in appearance and I love the amazing level of detail each figure has. The only thing different here is the facial print, this ACU has a single-sided face with a mouth open in terror expression as he&rsquo;s dealing with the escaped Pteranodon. Great looking figure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Simon Masrani: The head of InGen and the rest of the Masrani corporation, this delightful fellow has a very nice dull light blue torso and legs, a rather rare colour choice. He includes a double-sided torso print with the Jurassic World logo on the back, some leg printing for pockets detailing and a double-sided face with a terrified expression on one side and a regular expression with a half-smile on the other. He includes no accessories, features a black version of the Sleepyhead hair piece.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Pteranodon: An excellent looking dinosaur with some beautiful colour bleeding on the wings that show off the nice pattern this dinosaur was given by LEGO quite nicely. His wings can move up and down and he can open his mouth. Be advised moving the wings too often can cause them to detach from the clips.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: The build starts out with putting the Pteranodon and Simon Masrani together, following which you&rsquo;ll find the bulk of the Helicopter&rsquo;s chassis/fuselage being built here. Nothing terribly difficult to report here, like with most sets featuring stickers for details I caution that placement of the stickers on parts can be somewhat delicate if you want them aligned properly. Other than that the build is very simple and what you&rsquo;d expect from a LEGO Helicopter.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: ACU joins the fray next and then you get to build up the rest of the cockpit/propeller section and the side armaments for capturing the Pteranodon and returning it to its paddock. Again I say there are no difficult steps, nothing too repetitive or annoying, it&rsquo;s actually a pretty fun build for both sections of the helicopter.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Jurassic World 1: This is a very compact and fun little model. It matches the onscreen vehicle fairly closely, the big difference is the included weapons for play features which can be left off if you prefer. On the left side of the helicopter you&rsquo;ll find a large intake engine being used for a net launching weapon, we&rsquo;ve seen this before, and I still find this feature a bit of a trick to get it to work right all the time. The included net is also a bit too small to actively work in capturing the Pteranodon alas.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">On the right the ACU gets to have a small stud launcher weapon, it fires dark green transparent studs and the seat can fold up when the ACU isn&rsquo;t there to make the copter look less open. This feature is a lot more fun and less cumbersome for the profile of the vehicle.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set is a great one from LEGO Jurassic World, it&rsquo;s a cheap parts pack and has a load of charm. The model is loads of fun and fits both Minifigures fairly well. The only true problem is the stickers, but even then I can forgive it as I have become accustomed to it. I&rsquo;d recommend this set, in fact I&rsquo;d recommend grabbing a few extra to have a nice little fleet of helicopters, and Pteranodons for your LEGO Jurassic World display. Strongly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
