<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box looks like a normal $20 box but longer. For some reason they made 2 of the instruction manuals. So maybe Lego wants to waste paper aw man I can hear the trees crying.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Really good parts for a $30 set. Of course theres the dino and the 2 minifigs but the gyrosphere parts are really good because the only other way you can get the gyrosphere is by getting the $115.00 set. The chicken and the winch parts are also really good. The best part of the set in my opinion is the gyrosphere parts and the blue wrenchs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures\dino</h3>

<p>?The set comes with 2 minifigs and 1 dino</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GRAY (BILBO BAGGINS): For some reason this guy reminds me of bilbo baggins, maybe because of the hair piece. Anyway nice hair piece sence the last time we saw it was in the hobbit. Nice unique torso and I like how the belt goes around his shirt even on the back of his torso and normal legs.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i1.cdnds.net/15/19/618x537/movies-jurassic-world-lego-05.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ACU TROOPER: Ok our stormtrooper for this theme. We get a acu trooper in every set except for the polybag. Each one is unique and exclusive. This is the only one to not have a chess plate. He only has one face and that is a determined face.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://images.brickimedia.org/thumb/1/18/75916-acu.png/165px-75916-acu.png"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dilophosaurus: The main reason why your going to get this set and maybe all of the other Jurassic world sets (maybe not raptor rampage) is the dinos. This is the first time ever getting a Dilophosaurus in lego. &nbsp;His fins on the sides&nbsp;of his head are nice and as normal you can put a figure on his back. His arms and legs move by pins and his mouth can be moved in two positions: opened and closed. I wish they put a hole in his mouth so we could put a green lightsaber piece in it and it can look like it&#39;s goo.</p>

<p><img src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7598/16805114468_321b519f04.jpg"" /></p>

<p>In total we could have used one more minifig.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The building experience</h3>

<p>It took about 20 minutes and it was quite enjoying and fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Lets starts with the smallest build</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>GYROSPHERE: This is a hard thing to master building. It looks so simple but you have to make it right otherwise It wont spin the minifig. The technic pins have to be tightened and the minifigs hands have to be up. Overall through &nbsp;it&#39;s really fun to play with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>TRUCK: The truck is probably the 2nd best vehicle in this line. It&#39;s driving&nbsp;factor is really good as it can move better then most vehicles I have build. I wish there was a easier way to roll\unwind the winch in the front of the truck. The hood could have been printed and so could have the sides of the truck. There are flick missiles on the top of the roof. Which brings me to opening the roof up, the roof can be opened up by ball joints. There is a big knob at the back of the truck that you can move right and left which spills the crates which holds a chicken leg, a wrench, and binoculars. Overall could have used less stickers.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not the best set in the Jurassic world line but a good one. If you have $40 dollars, I suggest you spend it on the raptor escape set which is a good one. If you have $30 dollars or less I&nbsp;suggest you try to spend it on this one because the only other cheap Jurassic&nbsp;world sets are the polybags and the $20 one which sucks. Out of all of the Jurassic world sets, this one is in the middle. It could use one more minifig and the price could have been better.&nbsp;Anyway the main reason why this reminds me of the first Jurassic&nbsp;park is because of the scene where the guy is in the truck and then all of a sudden the Dilophosarus pokes his head into the truck and blinds\kills the guy. You could make this scene out of this set but you would need to make a custom guy. &nbsp;That&#39;s all from me and look at the other Jurassic park reviews.</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-06-21T03:02:18.087Z","I want Nedry!","<p>This is a good set for the price point, even if the price per piece is off. You get an exclusive dino and an exclusive minifig.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard packaging for 2015. The back shows the features, the front shows an action shot of the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too spectacular, although you do get the new gyrosphere pieces and the Dilophosaurus head. I&#39;m sure some of these pieces are being cast in blue for the first time.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this set, you get two minifigures, <strong>Gray</strong> and an <strong>ACU</strong> (Asset Containment Unit) trooper. Also included is the <strong>Dilophosaurus</strong> figure. Gray is an okay representation of the movie character, although I would have given him short legs. I believe his torso and face pieces are unique. The ACU trooper has some great printing, but aside from the face he is mostly the same as the others. The Dilophosarus is the same figure as the Velociraptors, but in different colors and with a new head. This figure was the main draw of the set for me. I loved it in <em>Jurassic Park</em>, and I was glad to see LEGO make such a spectacular figure, even if it is much too big. However, I can&#39;t expect them to make a new mold for every dinosaur.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for the gyroshpere is short but interesting. It does utilize Technic, but it really isn&#39;t that hard to put together. The build for the truck is pretty straightforward and what I have come to expect from a LEGO vehicle. I did have some trouble with the rope for the winch, though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great. For 248 pieces, some of which are taken up by the figures and the <strong>working </strong>gyroshpere, the truck is solid and a good size. The truck has several functions: an exploding mechanism that is activated by turning the spare tire on the back; a pair of flick-fire missiles on the top of the rollcage; and a working winch on the front of vehicle. All features work well and are a lot of fun to use with the other components.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I love this set. Although it did not appear in <em>Jurassic World </em>at all, it is a nice throwback to the trucks in the first film and is the only way to get Gray. The only complaint I have is that, while great in and of itself, the whole set was a missed opportunity. I really wish this set was released in the <em>Jurassic Park </em>colors and came with a Nedry minifigure!</p>

I typically don&rsquo;t have much more than nice things to say about LEGO Box designs, they&rsquo;ve been doing this since the late 70&rsquo;s and have definitely improved on box design to the point of mastering eye catching packaging design.</span></span></span></span></p>

This is a common thing in LEGO Jurassic World, all of the sets above 25$ have two manuals. For each manual in this set you will be given the standard build instructions which can be followed relatively easily. There is also a sticker sheet in this set.</span></span></span></span></p>

However this time you&rsquo;ll also find some great circular pieces that are being used for the Gyrosphere and two blue crowbars, a rare element as most crowbars are red in colour. Another perfect parts pack.</span></span></span></span></p>

This print is very impressive, I enjoy the uniformity of the detailing for all of these figures, unfortunately the ACU don&rsquo;t get the Jurassic World logo on their backs. But that just means these torsos are very versatile for MOC fans who want to build up a uniform police or security force in their MOC universes.</span></span></span></span></p>

He has a double-sided torso print with a checkered shirt design and a belt with fanny pack near his waist that looks great. His facial expressions include a happy smiling one and a terrified one, so he has a double-sided face. He comes with no accessories and Sam&rsquo;s hair piece from the LEGO LotR sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

This one uses the same torso and front arms as the Raptors, but includes new legs and a head for the Dilophosaurus and it looks very impressive.</span></span></span></span></p>

Most of this bag is a very quick build, you&rsquo;ll find yourself reaching the end relatively within twenty or so minutes after you&rsquo;ve started. Building the undercarriage of the jeep is a little bit repetitive which explains why it can get done so quickly.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: Complete the Ambush by finishing your jeep in this bag. Again it&rsquo;s very simple to follow along, the younger builders may require some help in getting the winch properly set up as like with all LEGO winches the string is very thin and small so getting it through the holes and then tied off securely so it won&rsquo;t come off again when you pull it for the play feature can be helpful. Sticker placement may also require help, other than that a very satisfying build.</span></span></span></span></p>

It does not seat two Minifigures unfortunately, so is not completely screen accurate. However I can understand why. All the detailing on the side is achieved with prints instead of stickers, unlike the jeep, which is great. The control panel is a sticker though, so it can&rsquo;t be all perfect. Still it&rsquo;s very fun to just roll this around and watch the Minifigure inside spin along, it&rsquo;s like a LEGO hamster ball.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Jurassic World Jeep: This vehicle looks very much like an updated interpretation of the Park Jeep seen in the first film. The only difference being the colours and the markings. This jeep is not accurate to the vehicles seen in the film, those are more compact and look very different, however I can understand that the more iconic look of the original jeep would make for a better LEGO model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I like this vehicle and am really impressed with the design of the model. Even with the tacked on flick-fire missiles on the top of the roll cage the model is extremely tight. The use of blue crowbars for design elements on the side of the front windshield is pure genius and as a bonus gives LEGO a new colour for the piece. The other two play features includes a tow cable on the front with a working winch and the spare tire in the back conceals a series of technic pieces which can launch the accessories from the back clear when the Dilophosaurus attacks.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s a great dinosaur included, a brilliant looking vehicle and a really fun model&hellip; The Gyrosphere is great fun. The price for this set is a bit of a higher one, we go from 25$ to 40$ and every set after that just grows in price. I&rsquo;d recommend this one for fans, despite the less than screen accurate design for the Jurassic World jeep, it&rsquo;s a great display piece and really strong as a cohesive whole.</span></span></span></span></p>
