<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are divided into two books, the Raptors are being the first to be assembled followed by Owen Grady his bike and Claire (with her printed 1x2 flat cellphone&nbsp;tile). They are easy to follow after that, the Helicopter rotor had me confused as I did not saw anything about it during putting the turret together, it was only after looking at the front of the box that I saw its use.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Raptors are similar to the ones from Raptor Escape only with a camera harness which is used in the film; Claire has a cellphone as an accessory (shame that no spare came of this), Owen Grady/Star Lord/Emmet/Chris Pratt has a geat&nbsp;printing on his torso as does Claire and the ACU Trooper (but only Claire and him are exclusive to this set).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Owen Grady is unique to the set as well as Claire.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Taking less than an hour for me this has some interesting techniques at the wheels and on the medical box that I look forward&nbsp;to&nbsp; to use myself.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A van, two Raptors (one of which is a main character), three minifigures with two exclusive to the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a neat model from the movie but at $50 I would have also included a&nbsp;Pachysephalosaurus&nbsp;or two to justify the price tag. If what you are looking is to add Raptors get them in Raptor Escape, if you are looking to have all main figures then this set is a must as Owen and Claire don&#39;t appear anywhere else.</p>

This Theme is great for Minifigure selection because there are now duplicates of any of the characters, buying every set will net you a bunch of generic ACU figures and Park Employees, while the rest are the main characters of the film with only a few characters not represented for some reason. This set is also great for fans of Raptors because you&rsquo;re going to get two of them.</span></span></span></span></p>

From attacking Raptors to Owen riding a motorcycle, the contents of the box are shown off brilliantly yet again and the background imagery this time is a nice looking dirt road surrounded by the jungles of Isla Nublar. It is a bit odd seeing LEGO sets surrounded by drawn imagery based on real world locations, but it works and works quite well to boot.</span></span></span></span></p>

You&rsquo;ll find the first two in the first manual and the last of the three bags is all in the second manual. The instructions are what you&rsquo;d come to expect from LEGO manuals and has no real problems in following theme. Once again you also get the stickers for detailing and no protection for any of the paperwork.</span></span></span></span></p>

However there are still a few, the rest are white, or some black pieces of course. The most interesting piece in this set is the new black head piece with the camera that both raptors wear, a really fun looking part, that unfortunately only fits on raptor heads so is only really useful for them. The dark green motorcycle chassis is a really nice one too, and if I&rsquo;m not mistaken pretty rare.</span></span></span></span></p>

He&rsquo;s got the same torso, legs and hat piece as well as the SWAT vest and the tranquilizer gun accessory. The only difference is his head, which is the standard one found on a lot of Stormtroopers over in LEGO Star Wars, perhaps one of them is moonlighting as an employee of the park while waiting for Rogue One to start.</span></span></span></span></p>

She has a double-sided torso print with her business suit on and the purple undershirt visible, her legs featuring no printing except for the belt, which has minor printing for the knot she&rsquo;s done up with her outer blouse. She&rsquo;s carrying a printed tile for a cell phone and has a double-sided face, one side frightened and nervous the other determined and prepared to deal with any trouble. Her hair piece was first seen in LEGO Movie sets, this time it&rsquo;s a nice rare orange hue.</span></span></span></span></p>

He does have some very interesting looking cues though and marks the third iteration of a character portrayed by Chris Pratt to join LEGO Minifigures.</span></span></span></span></p>

His legs have minimal printing for the belt, some pockets and some kind of sheath on one leg, perhaps a second one for his knife accessory. His head has two facial prints, one smiling and happy the second angry looking with teeth bared. His hair piece is fairly familiar for LEGO City collectors.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Blue: Blue certainly lives up to her name, as she has a blue tint to her skin as well as the printed markings on her torso and around her face. I will admit though she is greener as far as the plastic used goes than blue. Great looking animal piece from LEGO though, the Dino pieces worked out brilliantly for this line.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: Owen and Claire must escape from Blue and Delta, to help them start building Owen&rsquo;s Motorcycle and the truck Claire will be driving. This bag is relatively quick to go as you are only constructing the framework of the truck&rsquo;s chassis. Not much really to say about the build, it&rsquo;s straightforward and there aren&rsquo;t any problem spots here, it&rsquo;s rather silly to break this build up the way they have as you&rsquo;re left with some very unsatisfying bits because of how few parts are in use between the first two bags.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: ACU is here to lend a hand, and the driver&rsquo;s cab is next on the build agenda. There is a lot more involved with the build here, and a few stickers to place, I really enjoyed the bit where you got to build the front bumper and grillwork of the cab, it was fun, if a bit quick to finish. I also enjoyed how the made the side-view mirrors this time, and the axles under the chassis are very different from standard LEGO builds. Overall I&rsquo;d say this part is one of the more satisfying sections of the build for how much gets done with such minimal use of parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 3: The rear of the truck is build up here and there is a lot more use of stickers for detailing, so be aware of this fact, as some of the placements such as on the doors may prove tricky for younger builders. You&rsquo;re pretty much building a giant box here so there isn&rsquo;t much to it, however it is interesting to see how they completed the truck design, instead of building onto the chassis itself this box attaches via technic pins. So it doesn&rsquo;t lock on with studs to the back of the truck, this might seem like an odd design choice at first, however it works and works brilliantly. You also get to build a small missile launcher to fend off the Raptors.</span></span></span></span></p>

The wheels are almost as tall as a Minifigure, so the truck itself is fairly large compared to Minifigures. There are a lot of stickers for detailing unfortunately, some might not care for it. The Vet Unit, as the sticker refers to it, is the large container that can be detached from the truck, probably to help see to the needs of sick dinosaurs.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">It is here that the majority of play features and elements are contained, you will find two detachable computer monitors, one showing the status of the Raptors and what their cameras are picking up and the other a write-up on one of the dinosaurs in the park. You can attach the launcher to the top of the container via technic pin, here a Minifigure can sit and aim to fire the pressure based missiles at the attacking raptors. This can become a stationary turret by detaching from the roof and attaching to the helicopter propeller which sits loosely in the back as a stand. It&rsquo;s all-in-all a really solid model, as it should be.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s your standard LEGO motorcycle though, not much else to really say about it as a model.</span></span></span></span></p>

What&rsquo;s even more you get two Raptors, so I&rsquo;d strongly recommend this one as one of the must own sets from the Theme. In point of fact there are really no sets worth ignoring in this theme outside of the Polybag one. A great solid vehicle build with just enough to do to have loads of fun.</span></span></span></span></p>
