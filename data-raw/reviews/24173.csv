It includes a good selection of Minifigures and gives us a brand new Dinosaur mold not seen in past LEGO Dino based themes. I&rsquo;m extremely impressed by this set and this review will explain why.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box/Instructions</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: This is a huge box, the space inside is only half-used from what little I can recall as there&rsquo;s a lot of air in here. The design is the same as the rest of the Jurassic World sets and it does an excellent job showing off the set on both sides. The front has an impressive looking action shot of the set and the back shows all of the play features quite nicely with the dino chart also showing off the Indominus in all its glory.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: There are very few sets I pick up that have such thick manuals, this set in particular not only includes cardboard protection for the manual and the sticker sheet, but features a very thick manual that includes the build instructions in easy to follow modular build design. You build each section in numbered bags and the steps are fairly straightforward with little that jumped out at me as being difficult to follow.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The only cross promotion stuff is the LEGO Jurassic World videogame ad. You&rsquo;ll also find a Minifigure and dinosaur checklist in the back, like with all the Jurassic World sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

There is a lot of blue in the set, white, black, grey and clear parts are also found here. I would not call this set a parts pack though, the price alone is a bit detrimental for that unless it is on sale, but you will find a fair number of bricks in here.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The best elements from what I can see are the numerous green plates used, as there are quite a few of them in various sizes and even a triangle shaped one. The Gyrosphere parts are also in this set, it can be had cheaper in the Dilophosaurus set, however it&rsquo;s nice to see them used here as well. There&rsquo;s also thirteen cross-section pieces that make up the fence of the enclosure. Overall a decent set for unique and useful parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

For an accessory he has a walkie-talkie.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Dr. Wu: The mastermind behind the Indominus, Dr. Henry Wu is a really fun Minifigure. He has a lab coat over a dark black turtleneck sweater which is double-sided, the back of course has the Jurassic World logo. He comes with a piece of Amber and a beaker of some concoction or other that is probably dangerous.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">He also has printed legs to show the bottom of his lab coat and features a dual-sided face with a regular smiling expression and a smug smirk with one eyebrow raised. He&rsquo;s plotting something you can tell.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Vet: This minifig looks pretty much the same as the Vet in the T-Rex Transport set, he&rsquo;s got the same torso, legs, hat, accessories and I believe head. So yeah, he&rsquo;s probably a brother of the other Vet.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Zach: The older brother, Zach has a double-sided torso with a red shirt under an open hoodie sweater or jacket and a dual-sided face with a happy innocent expression and a terrified I&rsquo;m about to be eaten face. His pants are plain black and his hair isn&rsquo;t unique. Not much going for him as far as details or parts, but it&rsquo;s nice to complete the entire main cast of heroes from the film.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Indominus Rex: Some of the parts look similar to the Rex as far as the molds are concerned, but this dinosaur is made with all-new parts. Due to the design of this figure, I think the legs are the only shared piece between the two Alpha predators. I love the sinister looking expression on the head, this creature is definitely destined to kill a lot of people. She&rsquo;s mean and ready to eat.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: Zach in his Gyrosphere and the Gyrosphere launching portion of the complex is the first step of the build after getting the Indominus built. This section of the build starts out a great and satisfying construction project with very little in the way to trip you up as you move along. We&rsquo;ll discuss any tricky bits when we get there in the numbered bags, for this build it&rsquo;s very straightforward and there isn&rsquo;t much to worry yourself with.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: This portion of the construction involves the secondary section of the compound that features the Gyrosphere launching gimmick. This also includes a light at the top for nighttime play fun, imaginary only I&rsquo;m afraid as there are no light-up functions here. Nothing tricky at all with this set, although there is minor sticker placement for details on a single piece during the build, a small sloped part.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 3: The walls of the complex start to get built up here, this side is the section with the feeding action for the Indominus. This build is pretty straightforward, and that sounds repetitive, however it is true. The builds work quite well and the only difficult sections in my view are some of the sticker placement moments, applying small stickers to small surfaces can be difficult if you aren&rsquo;t careful.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The biggest part of the build I find quite interesting at this point, aside from just the overall look of the thing as it comes together, is the interesting use of ball and socket joint bricks in order to make the compound modular and attach each section in any configuration your imagination would care to go.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 4: The vet has been charged with feeding Indominus. Hopping out of bag 4 you can build the Minifigure and the small feeding station control crane that will be attached to the section of gate built in the previous bag. This is a quick and easy build, not as involved as the last one, and once finished the little crane sits on top of the round click joint piece on the top of the gate. Two chicken or turkey legs are placed into small cargo containers and the vet can swing them over the fence to feed Indominus once the compound is fully finished.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 5: The central tower of the complex is started here as you build the foundation for the control tower and some kind of lab area for Dr. Wu. No Minifigures in this bag yet, however it&rsquo;s a very quick build, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of details for the lower floor as it is meant to be a section where you could put the Indominus&rsquo; tail when she&rsquo;s in the compound. No stickers in this portion of the build either, just bricks on bricks.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 6: Here is where the upper level is complete for the control tower, helipad and Dr. Wu&rsquo;s lab. There&rsquo;s a few stickers to place while building up this section, as usual though there aren&rsquo;t any tricky bits until you reach the end where you have to place the long hose piece for the railing around the small walkway. This may seem simple enough, but lining everything up right so it bends properly and sits inside the droid arm pieces can be slightly frustrating. Fortunately in case of a problem they include two of the long rod-like hose pieces.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 7: ACU joins the team of builders as the Minifigure emerges to help build his helicopter. This little model is a very quick build, and is the second vehicle found in the set. It also has a few stickers for the tailfin, please be aware of which side is which when applying them as they are meant for only one side. Pretty standard build design for Helicopters of this size.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 8: Here you start to build the fence section with the breakaway play feature. That being said what you&rsquo;re building here is pretty small and doesn&rsquo;t feature as many pieces as the opposite side of the fence where the crane went. So nothing to worry about there.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 9: This is the part of the breakaway fence that rests on the jumper plates on the build you just finished. It&rsquo;s fairly quick to make and the sections go together without any fuss or muss. You put it together in two sections and then fix them together with the top sections.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 10: Dr. Wu is found here instead of in the control tower/lab, which is a bit strange, considering this build is just a small corner to link the two fence sections together with the large gate we have still to build. In fact this area is a small arsenal storage area, it features clips for the Vet&rsquo;s tranquilizer gun and stun baton to keep the Indominus contained with non-lethal response. It&rsquo;s slightly similar to the other build found opposite where you included the Gyrosphere launcher section. However there are differences.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 11: With the final stretch of the build you get to finally start on the main gate. This builds the foundation and the doors will be covered in bag twelve. It&rsquo;s fairly interesting that the largest plates were saved for this section, and the construction includes a lot of stickers, most of the rest that haven&rsquo;t been used yet is finally applied to parts during this build. Some help for proper placement may be required.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The front ramp section of the gateway is much more solidly attached compared to the Raptor Pen from the smaller set. This is a huge improvement and I wish LEGO had designed the raptor pen to be slightly larger to match the design used here better.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 12: The sliding gate doors are built up at last, it completes the central gateway and once that&rsquo;s done the last step is to attach it to the rest of the model via the specific joints found on the two triangular sections on either side. This uses technic pins and holes instead of the ball joints and sockets found on the rest of the model for the surrounding gateway. This makes for a much more solid connection, since the modular design is meant to adjust the fences after they are attached with the ball joints to fix the angle of the interior.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Overall a very solid build for the entire model with nothing that stands out as too difficult or boring. Just a lot of stickers to watch out for when placing them on the bricks.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Small Helicopter: A small secondary model that the ACU pilots, it&rsquo;s a decent enough looking model, but is not screen accurate. Since there was only one helicopter in the film and this doesn&rsquo;t look like it could fly far from the island when in use due to size.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There are two flick-fire missiles to launch at the Indominus and add more play features to the set. A fun little additional model for the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Indominus Complex: This model is quite impressive, it&rsquo;s one of the better playsets I&rsquo;ve gotten from LEGO in recent years and it features a plethora of fun and engaging play features. The outside features a crane that is used to feed the predator, it can rotate and turn and hold up the containers of chicken legs that the Indominus loves to eat.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Below the crane is an observational area where Minifigure can stand to watch the predator. Next to the crane is a small Gyrosphere launching device, with a long technic axle you can launch the Gyrosphere clear of the compound in an attempt to escape the Indominus.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">In front is a large gate, it can slide open and closed to allow access to the interior and is fairly iconic looking. It reminds me of the Main Gate, though it isn&rsquo;t designed to look like that very much. Next we have a weapon storage area for the Vet and ACU so they can have tranquilizer weapons and non-lethals to prevent the Indominus from escaping.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Then we come to the large wall, here you can pretend to smash through with the Indominus to escape by headbutting the wall and sending the parts flying. Then when you&rsquo;re ready to return the compound to normal you just slip the parts together to act out different scenarios.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">In the rear of the model you&rsquo;ll find a three story structure. The lower level can hold Minifigures, but it&rsquo;s inside, so watch out or you&rsquo;ll have Indominus chow on your hands. The upper walkway features a tranquilizer rifle aimed inside, two big lights for night time operations and an internal control area with a monitoring computer and desk for Dr. Wu to work his projects on.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The third level is a small Heliport where the helicopter can land and take off. There are no ladders for the characters to climb up there, which is a bit unfortunate, but inventive builders can create their own stairs to let the characters climb up when necessary.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">It might even be interesting to buy two of this set and combine both compounds into a much larger enclosure, with the modular ball and socket design it wouldn&rsquo;t be beyond the realm of possibility.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">While this set is pretty much a very large playset that isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. The colour scheme and the overall look of the set is quite enjoyable and makes it the stand out set for the Theme from me, compared to the T-Rex set at least this one is passable for a thing that was in the movie. It doesn&rsquo;t follow the look or design that was actually in the film for the complex, and that&rsquo;s ok, because it does what it set out to do. Make a decent dinosaur enclosure with enough play features to excite the younger fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The empty space and cramped quarters of the central tower is a bit disappointing, if only because it would have been nice to be able to fit more Minifigures around for a proper display. In the end though I can&rsquo;t recommend this set enough, the contents for what you&rsquo;re paying is just phenomenal, it&rsquo;s everything I&rsquo;ve always wanted out of a Jurassic Park/World playset and it&rsquo;s a great looking LEGO model, if a bit awkward to place on a shelf due to the triangular shape/design of the enclosure. A rectangle or square might have been a bit worse though in comparison. Anyway, strongly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
