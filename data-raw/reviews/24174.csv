"Orange2by4","2015-06-21T03:38:39.23Z","Who's the alpha?","<p>I bought this set under the assumption that I was buying a small boring base with no playability. You may ask why I bought this set then. I bought this set because it is a Walmart retailer exclusive and I wanted to own the main set of my favorite scene from Jurassic World.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the average size for a 35-40 dollar Lego set. On the back it shows all of the features of the set with semi detailed depictions of how they work. One feature is left out though. When you open the gate of the paddock there are two locks that keep the door open so it doesn&#39;t fall on the minifigs, vehicle, or raptors. The instructions are split into two booklets each showing how to build two of the four bags.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The first bag holds the parts to Barry, the raptors, and his quad. The second holds the parts to the gate. The third holds the parts to two of the wall sections one of those being with the feeding tray. The fourth holds the parts to the last gate piece and the tower.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I am satisfied with the minifigs in this set. As the theme in the Jurassic world series the main characters only appear in one set each. In this set we get Barry, Owens partner in training the raptors, and a minifig called Vet. This minifig is supposed to look like a new worker at the raptor pen from Jurassic world who falls into the pen and gets saved by Owen. Speaking of Owen I am disappointed that he does not appear in this set. Like I said the main characters only appear&nbsp; in one set each. Owen appears in Raptor Rampage, a set modeled after a later scene in the movie. I under stand the logic to only put the characters in one set, but it is a big letdown that Owen is not with the raptor pen in which he trained the raptors. I am not sad that it came with Barry, it just would be right for it to have Owen. The raptors Charlie and Echo are not minifigs, but I would like to talk about them. They are the basic raptor mold form Dino. They have new paint schemes and nothing else.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set was a fair experience. i am not sure How to rate this portion because I have never really <em>had fun</em> building a Lego set. The build was easy and not confusing. There are not ropes or string so no need to tie knots&nbsp; making this an easier build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I am very happy with the completed model. It has a lot of playability and features to entertain yourself with for a long time. I am a little disappointed because it is a little small to hold two raptors, but don&#39;t let that stop you from buying this set. As Lego usually does this set has been changed to be not as violent as the movie. In Jurassic World they send in live pigs for the raptors, but in the Lego version there is a feeding tray where you can slip in drumsticks. Also, in the movie the new worker falls in because he is trying to catch the pig, but since there is not pig there is a button where, if the raptors get rowdy, it will tilt the platform so the person falls. As I said before this set has locks to keep the door up. but in my set the door is tight so the locks are unnecessary.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this is a great set. The price per piece is great with 392 pieces and two molded dinos at 40 American dollars. It has great playability for fun for hours. I think that if you have this set you will need at least one other dinosaur for the two raptors to &quot;hunt&quot; as a small pack. If you see this one in a store do snag it up for it is very much worth it.</p>

"Lordmoral","2015-11-24T20:37:23.61Z","They are out!!!!!","<p>One of the best sets in the range, sadly only found on Walmarts and the LEGO SHOP.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The boa has pictures detailing the play features (raptors escaping). The instructions are easy to follow if a big repetitive.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Raptors sure are great and the ATV has&nbsp;some neat play features&nbsp;that where added taking designer creativity.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Being the only set where to find Owen friend Barry is a pretty must own if you want to collect them all, the Vet minifigure&nbsp;is basically that new intern that they showed in the movie that almost got eaten by the four raptors (although he used a beanie hat and a blue jumpsuit in the movie so this may be another character). The Raptors also count as figures and if you are looking for a Raptor figure and you do not own last year Dino&nbsp;sets and you have the money get this as this is one of the best sets in terms of value for money.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Starts with the minifigures and raptors and then moves into the ATV and finally to the enclosure.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A small enclosure that can hold the two Dino&#39;s easily with some room to freely move them but quickly runs out of space once you take into account the other two from Raptors Rampage. The padlock tower needed a believable stair but you could easily modify one and make the tower itself more strong if you don&#39;t want that play feature in the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Love key I said, if you want Raptors but lack the cash to get Raptors Rampage get this if you can, it&#39;s a better value for cash and the figures look good by their own if you are not getting the other JW sets.</p>

Mostly because we&rsquo;ve already gotten a set based around the Raptors, the Indominus, the Rex, a Pteranodon and a Dilophosaurus, so getting a second set focused on Raptors is a bit unexpected. Not in a bad way of course, though I&rsquo;d suggest checking out this review to see if this set is worth picking up or not.</span></span></span></span></p>

The design is all-around great catching the eye, showing off the product in exciting and interesting ways and even the background art is always a treat. In point of fact, though I didn&rsquo;t mention this in the Dilophosaurus Ambush review each box features a different background shot of a section of Isla Nublar, setting each set somewhere in the park.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: This set, as with all of the others, includes two numbered manuals which separates the build between the numbered bags in the set. Often done evenly you&rsquo;ll find each manual is for two of the bags in the set. They look great and the parts list and Minifigure checklist in the back of the second book really helps keep track of everything. The shot of Isla Nublar with each set represented somewhere on the island is carried through most of the sets manuals, you&rsquo;ll find it this time in the back of manual 1.</span></span></span></span></p>

There are not nearly as many in this set as some of the vehicle sets, but there are still some. You&rsquo;ll also find four of the 1x3 corner pieces, the kind that look like the L shape in Tetris, these ones are designed for SNOT builds as there are no studs on top and a raised section like an end piece or a bookend&hellip; If that makes any sense.</span></span></span></span></p>

He has a nice double-sided torso with a button up shirt visible in a, I want to say some kind of pale peach colour, it&rsquo;s a pretty interesting colour choice for a torso. With no head piece he only has a single-sided facial print with a somber/serious looking expression. There is no printing on his legs and he carries a tranquilizer gun with bright green syringe as his accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Vet: This is meant to represent the young newbie from the scene, unfortunately his hair piece is Ron Weasly&rsquo;s hair in brown, which isn&rsquo;t screen accurate as he was wearing a sort of tuque and had lighter hair colour from what I can recall. His outfit is the same as the other vets in the main retail sets, so he has no leg printing and a double-sided torso print with the Jurassic World logo on the back.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">He has two different expressions, a terrified one after he&rsquo;s fallen into the pen and a neutral one. His accessory is another non-lethal stun baton.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Charlie: This is the green Raptor, which as we know re-uses the parts from LEGO Dino. What I find interesting is that the description of this set refers to Delta and Echo being included and not Charlie&hellip; Somebody wasn&rsquo;t paying much attention during that write-up. Charlie has a tiger stripe like print for detailing which is the closest to how the original Jurassic Park raptors looked. Overall a fun looking dinosaur and a must have if you want all four of Owen&rsquo;s Pack.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Echo: I have no idea what kind of colour Echo is, it&rsquo;s either a very light mixture of peach and orange or some kind of brown. There&rsquo;s another tiger stripe pattern for his print on the torso and legs, but his head and tail feature unique markings that makes her appear more menacing, especially as her snout appears to have what might be a large scar running across it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: Charlie and Echo are free to menace Barry and his ATV once you finish building the contents of this bag, which is why I might suggest building it last after constructing the pen to keep the Raptors from eating any of the Minifigures. This is a pretty quick build, the ATV is relatively small and uses very few pieces, you can finish this bag in less than twenty minutes as there are no tricky or difficult steps here. Just two stickers to place as well, which shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard, though might still require help for the younger builders as they are being put onto relatively small pieces.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: The nameless vet and the front entrance to the pen are built next, this portion of the build is extremely satisfying as the door to the pen looks great and uses a very ingenious design for sliding open and closed. Due to the nature of this portion of the model it does involve a bit of repetitive building for asymmetrical design and the structural integrity is a bit questionable until you finish attaching all the pieces. Two parts in particular just love to come off while building, mostly because the two small sloped parts on the bottom of the plate in front of the entrance aren&rsquo;t attached to anything except the plate. Three stickers are applied to three tiles during the build which might require help, at least for the smaller square tiles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 3: The pen starts to get finished off here as you build one section of the fence to keep the Raptors contained. This is a rather short looking fence, it is designed to allow the raptors to sit inside of the pen and look over the fence, so why they don&rsquo;t just jump out is a huge question. Anyway, the build here is relatively quick, it includes part of the play feature with a feeding station for the raptors built into the fence, and again two stickers are being placed on square tiles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Placing the technic axles might require a bit of help to get them in just right, however other than that and the necessity of keeping the build on a hard flat surface until it is completed to avoid popping one of the plates on the bottom off while building there&rsquo;s not much against the build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 4: The pen comes to completion here as you build the remaining portion of fence and a large tower for a Minifigure to stand on for overseeing the raptors in the pen. The fence is mostly the same as what was built before, only with longer axles as there is no feeding station here. The large tower however is much different and incorporates a second play feature, which we&rsquo;ll discuss shortly. Only one last sticker to apply here and again you might need help in fitting everything onto the technic axles in the right place. Also, when attaching this final section via the short red axles to the gate be sure to apply only as much force as is necessary, the tower could come off if too much force is applied.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s a flick-fire missile on this vehicle for dealing with escaping raptors. A really fun vehicle that&rsquo;s fun to play with and it even has a license plate, a sticker for it of course, but still a license plate with the Jurassic World logo on it. It&rsquo;s also sort of accurate to the on-screen vehicle.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Raptor Pen: This model is nowhere near screen accurate to the actual raptor pen from the movie, and it is rather on the small side so you can only fit two raptors in it, so if you buy this and Raptor Rampage you won&rsquo;t be able to get all four inside unfortunately. It&rsquo;s also really short for the fence which means that the raptors should just be able to jump out.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The model is still very fun and makes a nice side model to the much larger and more involved Indominus Breakout set. You have a few play features, the front door can slide up to accommodate the raptors, there is a built in feeding station with some chicken/turkey legs that slides into the pen through the fence and the tower has a large black dish attached to a technic axle, the raptor can jump into this and tip the platform with the spotlight on it to send the vet tumbling into the pen where he can become lunch.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As this set was only made available through Wal-Mart or LEGO S&amp;H it is a bit harder to come by. Many Wal-Marts have long since sold out of this particular set. Do I recommend this set? That&rsquo;s a bit harder to commit to, in all honestly the model in this set is very lackluster when you really step back and take a look at it. The size of the raptor pen as a model is a bit too small for my liking, as it can&rsquo;t accommodate all four raptors once you own both sets. The Minifigures here are also a bit weaker, due in part to the nature of both characters being second or even third tier and not as important to the main plot of the movie.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">All of that being said, there is huge potential here, if you wanted to you could combine two of these sets into a much larger pen, the modular nature of the connector points involving technic axles means you can expand this thing. You can also heighten the level of the fence if you felt like it. And if you want all four members of Owen&rsquo;s pack you&rsquo;ll need this set to complete them. So I mildly recommend it, it isn&rsquo;t the best Jurassic World set, nor is it what I would classify as the worst, however if you only want one set with Velociraptors the Raptor Rampage is a lot more solid of a build so this one is safer to skip if you aren&rsquo;t interested in going all in for this Theme.</span></span></span></span></p>
