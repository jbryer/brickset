"xboxtravis7992","2015-10-01T20:34:17.277Z","Zombie Soldier","<p>For the second wave of the&nbsp;Bionicle reboot, Lego gave us an army of undead skull warriors. The Skull Warrior is a simple USD $15 dollar set, and gives a basic idea of what this range brings to Lego and Bionicle as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The hexagonal box continues into the second wave, while not as exciting as the old canisters of Bionicle&nbsp;&quot;Gen 1&quot;, they seem to be a step up from the Hero Factory ziplock&nbsp;baggies... The art is good, and makes you want to buy it, only to shortly thereafter discard the cardboard box in a trash bin after removing the Lego contents...</p>

<p>The instructions have a brief comic which looks like a recycled version of the online web episodes. The instructions work good, no noted mistakes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This guy has a lot of trans blue and trans orange parts, the combination can be a bit jarring but considering this guy is <em>dead </em>it is not that bad<em>&nbsp;</em>of a color choice. The parts of note include the ribcage style torso, the sword, the bone limbs, the printed chest piece,&nbsp;the gunmetal&nbsp;chunky armor bits, the trans blue &quot;ant&quot; legs used in the bow, a gunmetal skull mask,&nbsp;and of course the gold/trans blue Kopaka mask. Wow, that is a lot of parts!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course there are also the boring old white Lego studs, we get 12 of them here. Although not that valuable, it is evidence of traditional Lego pieces used in a Bionicle build... as ammo for the stud launcher of course!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For CCBS fans there is nothing new to the build here. However I would like to note that since these Bionicle 2015 sets are my first constraction sets since 2007, I can notice the difference between these builds and the classic Bionicle builds. This builds are a bit more complex than the old Bionicle &quot;slap limbs onto big chunky torso&quot; builds common in old Bionicle sets (I am looking at you Toa Mata!). It is nice to see the improvements Lego has made to Bionicle since its introduction 14 years back.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Skull Warrior when finished stands taller than a Protector, but shorter than Tahu. The trans blue is an eye&nbsp;catcher, but distracts from other parts of the model. Skull Warrior is very thin and gangly, but that is appropriate seeing he is an&nbsp;undead skeleton...&nbsp;When armed with his bow, he looks imposing and the use of some frictionless pins allows easy positioning with the bow in hand. However the pins grip very tightly to Skull Warrior&#39;s hands and are difficult to remove after having been placed. Skull Warrior&#39;s spear is intimidating, yet very simple. Both weapons can be attached to his back, although the instruction book only depicts&nbsp;how to connect his spear. His bow looks a bit oversized when connected to his back.</p>

<p>Skull Warrior&#39;s&nbsp;mask is pure awesome, the new Bionicle head allready has an edgy-robot feel to it (a Terminator look I guess), and this head goes above and beyond. This mask, IS what a Bionicle skull should look like, period.</p>

<p>Perhaps the one true oddball in the set is Kopaka&#39;s mask, if you don&#39;t have Kopaka Master of Ice then it is kind of useless. It doesn&#39;t look that good on Skull Grinder or many other figures for that mater. With some &quot;somewhat&quot; illegal moves I was able to connect Kopaka&#39;s mask to Skull Grinder&#39;s hands which does look cool, but once again not that useful without a mask less Kopaka&nbsp;figure nearby...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As a villain set, Skull Warrior is above average, but far from perfect. He is a real improvement over the Bohrok&nbsp;or Visorak of Bionicle-yesteryear: yet some classic Bionicle sets such as the Pirahka&nbsp;look better than Skull Warrior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Skull Warrior is saved by an interesting build, some cool weapons, and lots of cool parts. If any Bionicle&nbsp;2015 set deserves to be &quot;army built&quot; it is this guy. He looks good too with the Skull Spider&#39;s included in the Bionicle hero sets.&nbsp;I can see Skull Warrior being a hit with the kids, but don&#39;t think this is the set to convert AFOL&#39;s to CCBS. However, if you are a fan of Bionicle or constraction builds, this is a worthy addition to your collection.</p>

"timmytowntim","2016-09-03T00:24:51.17Z","Spooky Scary Skeleton!","<p>Skull Warriors are undead&nbsp;members&nbsp;of Kulta&#39;s army in BIONICLE G2 lore. Do they send shivers down your spine, or are they a jumpscare you saw coming? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skull Warrior was my first skull creature, and he&#39;s a fantastic set. I love his colour scheme,&nbsp;and he really rocks the undead look. He&nbsp;has one of the stud six shooters the Protectors have worked into his bow, and it looks and functions great.&nbsp; He has a transparent blue ribcage piece and the same mask as Kulta, though I believe Warrior&#39;s is darker. Let&#39;s not forget the partially trans-blue Mask of Ice,&nbsp;his gearbox, or&nbsp;his spear that can be attached to his back when he&#39;s using his bow&nbsp;(and vise versa) and we&#39;ve got quite the set on our hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Partially trans-blue Mask of Ice</li>
	<li>Gearbox that allows for arm swinging with the twisting of a knob</li>
	<li>Nice colour scheme&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Sweet bow</li>
	<li>Weapon storage on his back</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A bit lightly armoured in places, but he&#39;s a decaying skeleton, that&#39;s kind of&nbsp;the point.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, a fantastic 2015 set that I&#39;d recommend to any BIONICLE fan. &nbsp;</p>
