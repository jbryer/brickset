<p>Slicer&#39;s build is very similar to the Toa builds seen earlier in 2015, except for the fact that his gearbox is constructed in a way which allows for all of his arms to move when activating the gear function. Neat! Build: 3.5/5</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;m going to start rating the set based on parts of it, because I feel I get the best out of the small details of the set.</p>

<p>Firstly, his colour scheme. Many people dislike the new skeletal villains&#39; orange colours and have complained that they clash with the overall translucent colour schemes. I actually think the orange goes quite well with Slicer&#39;s translucent apple green, which in itself looks great. I honestly don&#39;t have much against the colour scheme...except that perhaps they could&#39;ve given him a bit more of that orange. 4/5</p>

<p>Next, we have his arms. All four of them move and are very good for posing. I actually think that the arms are perfect, especially because LEGO is going for a skeletal, risen from the dead look with this character. I have no problems with the arms. 5/5</p>

<p>The legs leave a little bit to be desired, however. I originally thought they wouldn&#39;t bother me and they still don&#39;t, but I feel that they are a little incomplete. I feel that they could have given Slicer even more asymmetry by placing some armour bits on one leg and leaving one bare, kind of what Skull Warrior does. Other than that, the legs are all right. 3.5/5</p>

<p>The torso itself looks actually quite good. I like the printing on his chest, I love the translucent green ribcage piece and love that it doesn&#39;t look as incomplete as perhaps one would fear it would. There are a couple of odd gaps, so I&#39;ll give this portion of the figure a 4.5/5.</p>

<p>The masks that Slicer comes with are excellent. He looks great with the skull spider mask, which is not at all as loose as many of the other masks. I like that he has the skull spider mask because he is the one character I can pose using that mask (I have not done so with any of the others). He also comes with Lewa&#39;s&nbsp;drained mask, which is absolutely stunning, and looks excellent on Slicer himself. As always, the masks are perfect, 5/5.</p>

<p>The weapons for Slicer are pretty general, but again, I understand what LEGO was going for. They are all pretty cool blades and I very much enjoy the orange claw that he comes with. It does get tangled around him when you use the gear function, but it&#39;s not something that should prevent anyone from buying him. 4.5/5</p>

<p>One of the final components of the set is playability. Slicer is extremely well adapted not only for playing, but for posing. His joints are all free, his arms all move, his claw weapon is fun, and he glows in light. I think he&#39;s a great figure. 5/5</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I would honestly say that Slicer is more a figure you&#39;d want just to play around with. I can understand why people have criticized the set for being &#39;ugly&#39; or &#39;poorly designed&#39;, but I must say I disagree with&nbsp;the latter statement. I honestly think he&#39;s a cool figure, perhaps not as cool as any of the Toa, or even Protectors for that matter, but if you want to get one villain, you really can&#39;t go wrong with any of them, including this one. Again, well done, LEGO!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: 8.8/10</p>

"Dragon_Master_48","2015-12-21T05:23:41.687Z","Quite a Fun Figure!","<p><strong>70792 Skull Slicer&nbsp;</strong>is one of the new &quot;Skull Villains&quot; of the BIONICLE 2015 theme. Although these villains don&#39;t quite follow the traditions of the original theme, I think, overall, their uniqueness does them a favor, and they hold up well both compared to the original and in their own right. There are a few aspects of this set in particular that stand out exceptionally well compared to its companions.</p>

<p>The build of the set is fairly interesting compared to most of the other figures in this theme so far; even though the same basic steps are retained, the construction of the gearbox is very different in order to accommodate the four arms.&nbsp;Having four arms, in fact, makes the figure very posable, as the arms can be coordinated together or moved in any way you like; bending the legs in a certain way can open a wider variety of poses with a great amount of stability, something you might not expect from a figure with smaller feet. The way the feet are build is very simple, but is just as effective at creating a stable figure without making the feet too large, something I feel would detract too much from its overall shape.</p>

<p>The new parts of this wave look especially good. The blades function well as classic BIONICLE-esque weapons, the new chest armor does its job well for an extra spooky factor, and the other new armor piece (here used for the shoulder) is very versatile. Although this is the only figure of this wave that didn&#39;t get a new mask, I think the Skull Spider Mask looks great on it. If you don&#39;t like the way it looks, however, you can always replace it with the version of the Golden Mask of Jungle also included (personally, I think it looks just as good, but in a hollow, lifeless way; that&#39;s actually a good thing here!).</p>

<h3><strong>Pros</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Has good proportions and overall looks very menacing.</li>
	<li>Is very, very posable (twice the number of arms is twice the fun!).</li>
	<li>Color scheme and armoring do the figure great justice.</li>
	<li>Fun to swing the blades around.</li>
	<li>Even though the Skull Spider Mask isn&#39;t a new part, it looks good for this figure.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Cons</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Chain is not fun to swing around and often gets in the way.</li>
	<li>No extra blade or other weapon&nbsp;included to replace the grabber.</li>
</ul>

<p>Personally, I feel like this is one of the best sets in the second wave of 2015, and possibly even among the best in the new BIONICLE theme thus far. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who&#39;s even a little bit interested in this theme-&nbsp;as it provides a certain standout charm the other figures might&nbsp;not to someone new to this style of building- and would, without any doubt whatsoever, recommend it to fans of BIONICLE 2015 and those who are looking for a set to go along with the previously-released Lewa set.</p>

"ThoughtLash","2016-03-08T12:41:26.123Z","Undead Four-Armed Gladiator!","<p>The most disliked set of G2 BIONICLE, let&#39;s see if he&#39;s really as bad as they say.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The basic G2 BIONICLE&nbsp;cardboard box, somewhat oddly shaped. Age warnings and parts counts are found on the front, while basic packaging&nbsp;info is on the back.&nbsp;The instructions are the normal size for sets of this type, and were neatly printed. I found no mistakes, although&nbsp;there was some slight creasing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s the best part (pun not intended... somewhat). Lots of great pieces in this set, mainly silver and trans-green.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Six trans-green normal size CCBS&nbsp;lower limbs are included, which are used as upper limbs in this set. The ribcage piece is included in trans-green, as well, which looks awesome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Six silver bone pieces are included, which are used for the lower limbs. The basic fist piece is included four times, and two Protector feet are also used for Slicer. A silver Skull Spider mask is used as Slicer&#39;s, although no legs are included. Three skull swords are included as his weapons, which are nicely detailed. Of course, the basic head is silver, as well as the torso. One of those large-size spikes is included as shoulder armor, as well as an extra.</p>

<p>Several gunmetal parts are used, such the printed&nbsp;chestpiece, and the armor on his upper right shoulder. This is the first time I&#39;ve had one of these pieces, and it looks great. There are plenty of details molded into it, and it certainly looks ancient. A single armor piece in this color is mounted on his upper left shoulder.</p>

<p>Five trans-neon orange parts are included, which I love. There are two Skull Spider legs, which are connected to a grey B1 Battle Droid torso, and coolest of all, a trans-orange chain. The basic G2 BIONICLE&nbsp;eyestalk is used in orange, and the smallest size of CCBS armor is used on the upper right shoulder.</p>

<p>Other parts are basically the gearbox, and these weird Technic pieces mounted on the back of Slicer&#39;s feet. I have no idea what they&#39;re supposed to do. Several pins and axles are included in various colors. Three of those odd little&nbsp;pieces that you turn are included, two in black, and one in yellow.</p>

<p>Lewa&#39;s&nbsp;mask is included in a blend of gold and trans-green. It looks quite sickly, and reminds me of Tahu&#39;s infected Hau Nuva in 2003. Mold-wise, it is the same as the last version, and reminds me of a Cybus Cyberman.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty easy, although the gearbox was interesting. This is the only G2 BIONICLE, and one of the few in both series, to have four arms. In all though, basically a normal G2 build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, while the concept is cool, the completed model is rather underwhelming. The upper legs, and upper arms of the lower two are completely unarmored. Only a few orange pieces are visible, and only two of them are actually part of Slicer, and while the asymetry is pretty cool, it just looks a little unfinished.</p>

<p>However, I do love the look and features. He certainly looks skeletal and undead, which the Skull Spider mask helps with. The&nbsp;armor on his right shoulder amd chest gives him a little bulk, which I think goes well with the overall thinness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gearbox feature is rather intricate for a G2 BIONICLEs, using a total of five gears, five axles, one pin, and a couple other parts to make all the limbs move. When finished, the effect looks great, although I think it would have been better to have a fourth sword than the chain, which flops around.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I must say, despite the many flaws, I do think that Skull Slicer is a good set. The exposed limbs are certainly opened for modifications, such as adding extra orange armor, or the like. Even if you don&#39;t like the set, there are&nbsp;plenty of great pieces, which make the set worth buying.</p>
