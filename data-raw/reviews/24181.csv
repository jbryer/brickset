<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same as used with other Bionicle 2015 sets, and like all of them is very thin and can be destroyed or damaged easily. Other than that it&#39;s ok.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I think it&#39;s the best set for those who want to get all new parts introduced in this wave. It has 4 new bone pieces, 4 new armor add-on pieces, two new axe weapons and a purple ribcage. There are also 4 transparent red armor pieces, but I think they&#39;re really common. He also comes with corrupted gold Mask of Earth.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing extraordinary, except the mechanism. It&#39;s not a gearbox instead a big red button for clapping with his axes or slashing.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a photo with it: &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/sJRagGG&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/sJRagGGm.jpg&quot; title=&quot;source: imgur.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>And two GIFs with it in action:</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He looks REALLY cool! Proportions are really good in my opinion, as well as the color scheme, though I would prefer more purple bones. His purple ribcage and printed armor add-on for it look awesome!</p>

<p>Horns add a lot to him and work well with the mask. His weapons fits his bulk and look great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great Bionicle set, has a lot of useful parts, really good design and good playability</p>

<p>Skull Basher comes with a variety of interesting new parts. They are mainly re-colours, but they&#39;re nice pieces to have. I especially like the purple ribcage and trans-neon orange shells.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for this one is quite different from the rest of the sets we&#39;ve gotten in the past year, save for a small minority. I really enjoyed the build and love the new function. It makes Basher that much more different from the other sets. I think it&#39;s clever that they used a Lego flag pole covered by a light spring piece to get the function to work, without the uses of elastic bands. For this innovative build and design of the figure, I give the build a 5/5.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks quite good! The trans-purple actually goes very well with the orange shells and the symmetry of the figure helps in making it look like it has just risen from the grave, but that it has some life still within it. I just love seeing this one in the sunlight as the purple glows in a very eerie manner. The colour scheme on this one is perfect. 5/5</p>

<p>The mask is exclusive to this figure, as well as to Skull Scorpio. I think that the mask is good size for the figure and have no major qualms about it. It does indeed look like an animalistic skull and the fact that it is small enough to look like the figure&#39;s actual face makes it that much more life-like. Onua&#39;s mask is included and it is a nice addition, especially seeing the trans purple on it. I like it very much!&nbsp;5/5</p>

<p>The arms on this fellow are well done. There is once again a mixture between trans bones and the &#39;skelly&#39; bones in silver, which are covered beautifully up by shoulder armour pieces in gun metal grey. The arms are complemented by the trans-neon orange shells placed slightly behind the figure&#39;s torso on its back. 5/5</p>

<p>The legs are the most perfect of all the skull villains in my opinion. There&#39;s just nothing I can complain about with this one&#39;s legs. I love the feet pieces, just as I loved them on Onua. I suppose the designers could have added another pair of trans-purple bone pieces into the legs, but that is nit-picking at this point. The legs are skinny, but have remnants of armour in the form of trans-neon orange shells covered up again by the same skeleton armour&nbsp;with what look like tufts of hair or fur. 5/5</p>

<p>The torso is also the most perfect of the skeleton figures for me. I love the chest design, I feel it fits the character very well. The function I really enjoy using, pressing the red button at the back and having his front arms clap together. I love that you can also move the arms in a way that mimics the old Rahkshi functions from the olden days. I personally have no problem with the shoulders being located way behind where they should be, nor do I have an issue with the red button at the back. After all, this is a monstrous being and his disproportionate anatomy work well for him. 5/5</p>

<p>The weapons are not as much an issue as are the fact that they are held in an odd way by the character. I have had issues using the function with the extra axle sticking out from the bottom halves of his hands, especially since they get stuck on the armour pieces around his legs and torso. Otherwise, the weapons look great and you can always choose to forgo the use of those bottom axle pieces. 4.5/5</p>

<p>This figure has an excellent design. That being said, I feel that playing with him can be a bit of an issue, especially when it comes to using his clapping function. I have found that his horns are so large, that they can interfere with the use of the function, which can be problematic. The horns themselves are also designed in a way that essentially allows for his mask to come off too easily if handled the wrong way. This can lead to ultimately losing the piece if you&#39;re not careful. He is otherwise a lovely figure, very good for posing and the clapping function is just super fun. 4/5</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, if you are into the figures for their design or play value, this one is the best you would be able to get out of the skull villain figures. It is both pleasing to look at and loads of fun to play around with (just do watch out for his horns). Unlike some of the other figures that we have seen, this one combines playability and design in a great way and I think he is very worth getting, especially for the price that he&#39;s listed at. Great job, LEGO!</p>

<p>Overall: 38.5/40</p>

"Dragon_Master_48","2015-12-21T07:06:35.45Z","Style More Than Function","<p><strong>70793 Skull Basher&nbsp;</strong>is one of the new &quot;Skull Villains&quot; of the BIONICLE 2015 theme. Although these villains don&#39;t quite follow the traditions of the original theme,&nbsp;I think, overall, their uniqueness does them a favor, and they hold up well both compared to the original and in their own right. On the other hand, although this set starts with a strong concept, it isn&#39;t quite perfect in its execution, but is still an interesting figure.</p>

<p>With the exception of Skull Scorpio, this set in particular has the most unique build in the second wave,&nbsp;as it doesn&#39;t use a gearbox at all (something which has been a signature of the new theme)! Instead, it uses a type of spring function that pushes the arms forward... which, as I will describe later, does not always work like it should.&nbsp;Building this function is probably the least enjoyable part of the build because, although it is interesting,&nbsp;it constantly wobbles around when holding it during building, making it difficult to attach new parts. However, the rest of the build is enjoyable.</p>

<p>The figure is very stable on its large feet, and the armor does a good job at recreating a minotaur-like creature. The weapons have a lot of cool factor, although they&#39;re one of the reasons why the function doesn&#39;t work right- the weapons always slam against each other with great force and become unaligned, making it difficult to use the function again immediately after, which is really unfortunate (I noticed that it&#39;s hard to press it &quot;gently,&quot; so this is almost always a problem).&nbsp;One thing I would change about the function is to either make it more stable (reduce side-to-side wobbling), or&nbsp;extend the shoulder width so the arms are less likely to forcefully&nbsp;slam against each other&nbsp;and push themselves out of the way (which might also solve the problem of the horns getting in the way).</p>

<p>The parts of this set are really pleasing, however. I always enjoy purple pieces, and the fact that the chest armor (and a few other pieces) is purple in this set is a good reason to buy it.&nbsp;As I said before, the weapons and armor are really fun to build with, and can look good on most figures. Both masks included in this set are great, but especially the new variation of Onua&#39;s&nbsp;golden mask.</p>

<p>Although the figure is stable, the aforementioned wobbling due to the function makes posing the arms a pain- there&#39;s really only a few workable poses this figure can be put in when not in play in order to look good. When I bought this set, I expected something really awesome from its appearance, and although I don&#39;t regret my purchase at all, it doesn&#39;t quite rise up to my expectations.</p>

<h3><strong>Pros</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Looks really awesome. Like, really really awesome.</li>
	<li>Color scheme and mask work well.</li>
	<li>Good variety of parts, and, if you ignore the function, a strong overall assembly.</li>
</ul>

<h3><b>Cons</b></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Hard to pose because the slightest touch will send the arms swinging.</li>
	<li>Function is very difficult to use properly, and is obstructed from just about everything on the figure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this is an average set. I&#39;m not quite sure I&#39;d recommend it as a first set to non-BIONICLE fans looking to get into the theme, but it&#39;s a strong pick for collectors of those looking for a wide variety of interesting parts. However, it pairs well with the previously-released Onua, both due to the similarity of the figures and the additional mask included in this set.</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2015-12-13T22:01:19.703Z","Purple Bull-Man And His Hug Of Death!","<p>I have received, for an early Christmas present, 70793 Skull Basher. So, Brickset reader, I figured I would review it for anybody still shopping.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is hexagonal, same size as the other $15 Bionicle sets for this year, and made of very weak cardboard. Instructions are pleasantly unfolded and oriented vertically, so more of the same.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Woo! There are a lot of nice parts here. There&#39;s the ribcage torso shell in trans-purple, two trans-purple 5M &#39;B&#39; bones, two large beast feet in black, the horns and spikes in dark purple, Onua&#39;s mask in blended gold and trans-purple, an exclusive printed &quot;super chest&quot; in gunmetal, and 4 gunmetal art deco armor add-ons. Also of note is the narrow torso in silver and four arm bones, also in silver, and the bull skull mask. And finally... a 24mm bit of corrugated pipe, which has a very special use.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is neither long nor complex. Legs go on the torso, then we get the arm mechanism. There&#39;s a block of Technic that moves in and out, and then the springy corrugated pipe goes in as a spring to make the mechanism bounce back, then it goes on the torso. From there it is pretty much any other Bionicle set this year.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Well, it&#39;s short. It doesn&#39;t look terribly imposing, even to the smaller Toa. However... he also looks really cool. Skull Basher has a very solid-looking color scheme and is frighteningly symmetrical. He has, technically, 3 functions. First is the mask, which flies off at the slightest tap to the body, head, horns, weapons, etc. Problem with this is, the horns are connected to the eyestalk, and the eyestalk sticks out by a ton, so there&#39;s way too much lever to knock this thing off. However, the interesting bit is the red button on the back. By firmly pushing it in and then removing your finger, the arms do a sort of &quot;HULK SMASH&quot; thing and slam into each other. You have to take the axes out of his hands, though, otherwise they slam into his horns and fling his arms around. Also, you can swing it from side to side and he has a sort of a punching motion.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As the skull villains go, this is my favorite. Just be wary of the included Pakari: It has no stand or anything, and is likely to get lost. Which would be sad, because it looks awesome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

"ThoughtLash","2016-06-03T21:24:23.047Z","Undead Bull Warrior!","<p>I found this guy for $4 in the clearance section at Wal*Mart, with a slightly smashed box. Of course I bought him!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The typical BIONICLE 2015/16 box, an oddly-shaped 6&quot; or so cardboard box. A picture of Skull Basher graces the front, along with ago and part info, while a short comic is on the back. This same comic is found in the instructions.</p>

<p>Instructions are the basic small CCBS set, a couple of inches long. There were no mistake that I could find.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>My favorite part of the Skull villains, their parts. A silver torso is included, the basic CCBS with only two ball joints on the shoulders. Four skeleton limbs are used in silver, as well as the hands and G2 head. The two axes carried by Skull Basher are in silver, which looks cool.&nbsp;The Bull Skull Mask is also in silver, but I&#39;ll get to that in a little bit.</p>

<p>Three trans-purple pieces are included, the ribcage, which looks awesome, and the two upper arms. All three look cool, although I think some should have been used on the legs as well. Four small&nbsp;trans-orange shells are used as both shoulder and shin armor.</p>

<p>Seven gunmetal pieces are used, one printed chestplate with red and silver printing, showing greebles, ribs, and chains. Two medium-length shells are used on the upper arms, over which two of those really detailed, curved armor pieces fit. Another pair is also used on the shins.</p>

<p>Four solid purple pieces are used, both horns and spikes. The two massive, curved horns for Skull Basher&#39;s head, which look really cool but are also crazily oversized, and two small spikes mounted on Basher&#39;s shoulders. An extra of the latter is also included.</p>

<p>Various other pieces are included, mostly black limbs and connectors, such as large feet and the lower legs. The rest are some basic Technic connectors, along with two of the straight Hordika necks. Two interesting pieces to note the System antenna and round piece&nbsp;used for the bashing mechanism.</p>

<p>Two masks are in the set, the Bull Skull Mask, one of my favorite G2 masks, and a gold/purple version of the Mask of Earth, which represents it&#39;s energy being drained. Both are impressive, with the trans-purple blending well with the&nbsp;gold on the latter.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was a very fast build, taking less than 10 minutes. The torso and limbs are the basic CCBS build which is very simple. However, the bashing mechanism took a couple minutes, and was rather complex.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Skull Basher is quite a nice little set. He has a great design, with very nice colors. The bulky armor and horns certainly give the impression that he is a bruiser, and the huge dual axes don&#39;t hurt that look.</p>

<p>For features, Basher has a removable mask, which can be popped off by pressing down on the back of his head. Unfortunately the oversized horns can make this a little too common of an occurrence. Now for the titular bashing feature. This works really well, causing the two axes to slam together. Unfortunately the mechanism is a little wobbly, and will shift when lifted or otherwise moved.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Skull Basher is a very cool set, although I&#39;m not sure if he&#39;d be worth the full price. For $4, or even $7, which was his original discount price, I&#39;d highly recommend him. Full price? Maybe, but I&#39;d try to find him on sale.</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>It&#39;s CCBS, theirs nothing special to point out beside the &quot;function box&quot; that stick on the back.</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>Skull Basher stand very well as it stand, but it appears the least interesting in the army to me probably because he looks like an &quot;army building&quot; character like Warrior and Scorpio in my opinion. Making it bigger will distinguish him better, but will bump his price.</p>

<p>The color is constant with gunmetal, silver, purple, and orange. The trans-orange is less &quot;clustered&quot; from the other group because it&#39;s not too noticeable to be an eye-sore.</p>

<p>The arm stick out far, leaving a noticeable gap that is bigger than the gearbox from the side view.</p>

<h3>Function:</h3>

<p><strong>Skull Basher has 2 function</strong></p>

<p>1. <em>The mask can pop-off by hitting the brain-stock, however the horn is an alterative that makes the function more hated because you need to be more careful while playing/posing to avoid losing his mask.</em></p>

<p>2. <em>The back has a red button that allow you to bashing forward by pressing the button or swing side-by-side. It&#39;s unique to him but the horn and armor interfere the function alot, also the weight of the weapon will push his arm to an angle to interfere the body even more.</em></p>

<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Reasonable color scheme</li>
	<li>Has 2 function that other 2015 set don&#39;t share</li>
	<li>Contain a decent amount of parts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Horn and Armor interfere movement alot</li>
	<li>Lack of purple on the lower section</li>
	<li>Doesn&#39;t look like a &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot;</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot to go over visually with Skull Basher, so let&#39;s start with the best part&nbsp;of any set - purple. He has some purple limbs, purple spikes, a purple ribcage, purple... Horns? That&#39;s right, Skull Basher appears to be a Minotaur&nbsp;of sorts, which leaves him with a fairly unique look. The horns are great if you&#39;re displaying the set, but if you want to repose or play with him, they become a nightmare. You see, they&#39;re attached to an axle holding his brainstock&nbsp;in, so if you bump a horn against anything, his brainstock with move, sending his mask flying across the room. Speaking of masks, Basher comes with a partially trans-purple Mask of Earth, and more purple is always a good thing in my book. He also has a unique function as opposed to the gearbox most sets of his price bracket have. He&nbsp;has a small red circle attached to a function on his back, and when pressed down on, the arms move forward in a little bashing motion, and you can press it from one side to swing one arm instead of both.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
