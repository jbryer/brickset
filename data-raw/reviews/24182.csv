<p>I found this set at a LEGO Store, so I got it along with some other stuff.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Skull Scorpio comes in a cardboard box like the other 2015 BIONICLEs. It is printed with parts count, age suggestion, and a bunch of other stuff. The instructions are a nicely printed booklet, and I found no mistakes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>AWESOME!!! The parts in this set are amazing. Legs, claws, blades, spikes, trans-green, and those masks...</p>

<p>The legs are new for me, they would look great on a Makuta, same with the axe blades. The trans-orange claws are nice pieces, as are the trans-green armor and CCBS pieces. The body is silver, which is a new color for 2015. Both masks look great. The corrupted Kakama, er, Mask of Stone is reminiscent of the Infected Kanohi of 2001/3, and the Skull Mask looks very menacing.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Aside from the leg connection and tail, the build was super easy. I built it within 15 minutes while waiting to go to a &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic concert!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This guy looks GREAT. Very reminiscent of the Nui-Jaga rahi from 2001, right down to the tails that snap forward. The orange half of the pincers are movable, unlike the legs. That would be my only complaint, as the legs are completely static and cannot move.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I say this with all of my&nbsp;(current)&nbsp;reviews, but I mostly review sets that I love - I highly recommend it.</p>

The mechanism is fun, and the parts and colors are great! The only real downside is the legs don&#39;t move and feel a little fragile. Something closer to the Hero Factory Scorpio set is an easy modification and more what the set needs. Overall, especially if you&#39;re buying it for completion, I think you&#39;ll find it better than you expect.</p>
