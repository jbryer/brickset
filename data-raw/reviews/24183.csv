<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Unlike the other 2015 BIONICLE retail sets, this set comes packaged in a rectangular box. It is fairly small and is a different shape than what we usually get. There is fantastic art on both sides and the figures&#39; features are displayed nicely. The instructions feature a small comic and a picture of all the sets and masks for this wave, which is nice. I found no errors in the manual and it was easy to build the figures.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Obviously, one of the main draws of this set are the parts. We get three exclusive masks: Kulta&#39;s mask, which is just a recolor, Ekimu&#39;s Protector mask, another recolor, and the brand new, totally awesome Mask of Creation. The level of detail on this mask is insane. We also get some new shell detail pieces, which are always nice.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set is like building a Protector and a Toa back to back. Nothing special, except Ekimu uses a gearbox, unlike other figures of his size. I still enjoyed seeing the figures come together nonetheless.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is fantastic. Both of the figures look great and Kulta suitably towers over Ekimu. Personally I prefer Kulta of the two. The poseability on both figures is great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is definitely a must have for Bionicle collectors. You get the big-bad villain of this wave, the ultimate good guy, and an exclusive mask. Even if you don&#39;t know about Bionicle, you should consider this. It is a great entrance point because you have everything you need in one set.</p>

"Xendor173","2015-09-16T20:56:05.147Z","Getting Better","<p>Well now, this is what I call a BIONICLE!</p>

<p>As a fan of the original line of BIONICLE, I must admit I have been quite disappointed with some of the revival sets, especially those of the Protectors. However, I will admit there are a few jewels mixed in with the pile that would fit perfectly with the old fossils.</p>

<p>This set is one of them.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty large, establishing that this set is BIGGER than any of the others. Now of course it is, but that&#39;s only because we have a mixture of two figures, one the size of a Protector, the other as tall (or slightly taller, but not very noticeably) as Kopaka. I&#39;m not saying the size of the box is a bad thing, it just does a good job advertising the content in the size itself.</p>

<p>On the front of the box, we see the Mask Maker and the Skull Grinder fighting for the Mask of Creation. One thing I didn&#39;t notice from seeing the pictures online is that the Grinder is holding the Mask over a melting pot, not the stand on which the Mask hovered. This fits well with the short story comic on the back of the box, but not with the online advertisement, where the Grinder put the Mask on. Still, this makes the situation more serious for the Mask Maker, because the Mask of Creation is the soul of his reputation. I&#39;m sure that LEGO will tone it down a bit, but that&#39;s basically what&#39;s happening.</p>

<p>Along with the comic strip on the back, the box shows a range of functions, as well as&nbsp;a combination set with the Mask Maker, Skull Grinder and Scorpio.</p>

<p>The instructions are easy to follow, and the flashy pictures at the back do an amazing job advertising the other sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are pretty cool. I love how the Skull Grinder&#39;s limbs expose a bone-like structure, while his mask portrays a skull. The Mask Maker also comes with some unique parts, including the golden center of his shield, and the Gold/Tans-Blue mask he wears is pretty cool to look at. While I am not a big fan of the rotating stud-cannon, it does provide a nice, playable feature.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Speaking of playability, I love the functionality of these sets. From the spinning saw-shield of the Mask Maker, to the mask-grabbing spear of the Mask Grinder (yes, it actually grabs masks, I tested it), this set comes with a wide range of incredible abilities. I love how they have rotatable arms that swing with the gears. What&#39;s more, it is obvious that LEGO watches the reviews on YouTube, because in JANGBRiCKS review of this set (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4QYR0FuBL4"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4QYR0FuBL4</a> )&nbsp;took note of the Skull Grinder&#39;s lack of strength to hold his spear. At this very moment, I have my Grinder holding his spear straight out, with hardly any problem. Great job, LEGO!</p>

<p>Now I will say, I do have a few things that I am not quite sure of. For one, when you look at the side of the Grinder, he has one big gap that reveals a lot missing behind the chest piece. Not only that, but his head is so low to the chest, that he seems to have no kneck. However, this can be fixed by simply breaking the instructions for one instance. At step 13, the set asks you to put piece 6001085 on with the two connector pieces inserted in the&nbsp;center and bottom openings. Instead, insert those&nbsp;connecters into the center and TOP openings. This will bring the chest down far enough to keep him from bumping his chin every time he turns his head, as well as slightly fixes the gap problem.</p>

<p>Another issue, though, is the stand for the Mask of Creation. In the instructions, it displays the mask facing upright and looking out. However, while the Mask is able to stay on, the grasp is so loose that it faces down instead of out. Unfortunately, I couldn&#39;t figure out a fix for that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself is pretty easy. I love the fact that it is more complex than Hero Factory. Skull Grinder kind of reminds me of Sidorak of 2005 for some reason, and the Mask Maker is heavily armored up. It took about 7 minutes to build the whole thing.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is pretty cool. I can only find&nbsp;a couple&nbsp;build flaws, one that can easily be fixed, and the playability is perfect for the younger, second-generation fans. If you are willing to spend $30, go get it.</p>

"DarterTheVanquisher","2016-10-12T22:56:56.1Z","""Just keep on fighting as long as you can!"" ","<p>I got this set for Christmas and really like it! On to the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>THe box is a normal box and is the only g2 Bionicle set to have a box. The instructions are smaller then I had at first thought and are the same size as Tahu&#39;s.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts have some good gold trans blue and then lots of skeleton parts</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build started with the Skull Grinder, moved to Mask Maker, and then finally the mask stand.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>First we will start with Skull Grinder:</p>

<p>His build is smaller then Black Phantom my largest regular figure. However his weapon looks more powerful then Phantoms mace. When i started playing with the figure I used some Toa as punching bags for the weapon and sent them flying across the room! With this weapon he is able to fight most of the things that come at him. His sword is cool but feels lacking in the sense of how small it is in comparision to the staff. The mask stealing function on both weapons are good as the staff can rip them off of victims and the sword can pull but not hold masks to.</p>

<p>Mask Maker:</p>

<p>This is the really cool looking figure of the set. with his golden protector mask he looks really good and with the mask of creation he almost as good. His hammer has a really cool function as it can shoot a volley of studs at his foe. Also it is connected to a gearbox that will allow him to make cool hammer smashes. Looking at the figures the only way to see this figure winning is if you use the story powers of the sacred hammer.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a great battle in a box, better then last years queen beast. If you wanted a single G2 Bionicle set make it this one.</p>

"timmytowntim","2016-09-10T00:46:44.727Z","""Your power comes not from numbers. Your power comes from unity. But duty awaits.""","<p>Ekimu&nbsp;is an ancient Mask Maker in BIONICLE G2 lore, and Kulta is the undead leader of the Skull Army. Are these guys&nbsp;double the fun, or is it&nbsp;<em>two</em> late to save them? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is G2&#39;s first two-pack set, and personally, I think it&#39;s among the best G2 sets ever. Let&#39;s start with Ekimu (Mask Maker). He&#39;s a protector sized set, but he has a gearbox, allowing you to swing his arms about with a knob on his back, a feature not seen in any other small sets. He also has some pretty snazzy trans-blue and gold pieces, including his mask, which uses both of those colours.&nbsp;He also has a stud shooter built into his hammer, which looks and functions great. I also really like how LEGO used a Disney princess carriage wheel piece on his shield. Overall, I think Ekimu&nbsp;is a fantastic set, especially for his size.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up is Kulta&nbsp;(Skull Grinder). He&#39;s a pretty standard Skull Villain model, with the Skull Warrior mask in a slightly lighter shade, some cool horns, and the ribcage piece in trans-red. He has two weapons: The blade piece Skull Warrior and Slicer have, and the &quot;Mask Stealer Staff&quot; a staff designed to, say it with me now, steal masks. It uses three of the Skull Scorpio stinger pieces, and, as a direct result, is extremely heavy by BIONICLE weapon standards. It weighs his arms down, as they&#39;re attached to a gearbox, and he can be tough to pose. He&#39;s pretty gappy near the front,&nbsp;too.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Conflict in box</li>
	<li>Mask of Creation included</li>
	<li>Ekimu&nbsp;is amazing for his size</li>
	<li>Kulta looks pretty nice</li>
	<li>Good colour schemes&nbsp;on both figures</li>
	<li>Gear function on both figures</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Kulta&#39;s&nbsp;ridiculously heavy staff</li>
	<li>Kulta&#39;s gappyness</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this set is fantastic. It might be my favourite&nbsp;G2 set in all honesty. Definitely&nbsp;recommended.</p>
