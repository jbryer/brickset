<h3>Box / Instructions</h3>

<p>The 3-in-1 box art is, as always, filled with amazing photos. The box back display of all three models is a good selling point, the expanded art for the off-road vehicle is nice, showing off the features. The inventory panel is small, but readable - and included in the manuals.</p>

<p>The three manuals are well thought out, very thorough and easy to follow. The builds are ranked in this set, a nice feature, but one better suited to the box. Despite their difficulty ratings, I found all three builds quite easy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are an interesting mix, a few I&#39;ve not seen before, but as a collector, all the parts blend with my collection nicely. I&#39;m glad to see the return of true Trans-blue to the color scheme (there are two 1x1 round plates in this shade) as I&#39;m not a big fan of Trans-teal. The winch is a bit hard to turn for my over-50 fingers, I suspect younger hands will have no problems with that. The tyres are new to me, but cool.My only criticism, if there is one, is that there needs to be more red parts to blend this set in with the Octan theme.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>All three were amazingly easy and fun to build. Usually I can pick the model that gave me the greatest satisfaction to complete, but honestly, all of them were equally pleasant. Being older, it took me a while to arrange the parts, but each build was under two hours, something I couldn&#39;t say with the Yellow Racers set (reviewed later).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t have enough memory cards to hold the pictures I *want* to take with these, I&#39;ll have to settle for a few action shots, when I get there.&nbsp; The boat won&#39;t float of course, but it fits in with my neice&#39;s Swamp Police sets for a rescue boat. The helicopter is equally versatile with her Police sets as a rescue vehicle. The off-road might do well with her Forest Police set, but Uncle needs some swoosh time too!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have a lot of the Creator series, and this one is one of my top three recommendations for the teen to adult builders out there. The under ten crowd may not enjoy the subtle features of each model, but the rest of us can swoosh on, winch ready, fire extinguisher manned and all adventure systems go! I highly recommend this set, I&#39;ve had lots of fun with it, you will too!</p>

<p>Until next time, this is Chris Tango with the Huw review, signin&#39; off.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty standard and of course shows all 3 builds</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I couldn&#39;t see any parts I hadn&#39;t seen before but some are unusual colours</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are none in the set but I managed to fit one in the car and hovercraft</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I started with the helicopter which is classed as the easiest build and it was very enjoyable and took longer than expected, it looked so nice I didn&#39;t want to break it up to rebuild it so i built part of a different&nbsp;set so i could still look at it for a while.</p>

<p>The hovercraft is the intermediate model and again is a&nbsp;longer than expected build with interesting reuses of the parts and again looks too good to break up so I left it for a while.</p>

<p>The off-road 4x4 car&nbsp;is the&nbsp;main build of the set and uses all the parts included (you have parts left over after both the hovercraft and helicopter builds), again it takes longer than you expect and the detail is very good( the seat alone includes 11 pieces and can fit 2 minifigures without hats if you position them tightly or one fig comfortably),&nbsp;interesting reuse of parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All three models look good but the 4x4 is the star and they are all&nbsp;very robust models for playing with.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As my first creator set I couldn&#39;t be happier with this set, the models are good and you get 3 times the building fun, a definite value for money set and I will certainly be getting more creator sets.</p>
