<p>First review here on the site and I&#39;m a little nervous because after being an administrator for a forum in a past life, I know being outside from the regulars in a group it can sometimes be a little rough at first.&nbsp; Anyway, figured I&#39;d start by dipping my toes in the water and then jump right into the deep.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Since I open and display my purchases, I&#39;m not going to go into too much depth here.&nbsp; Three booklets for three seasons.&nbsp; (Was hoping that they would have added a more Spring-like build which would have been easy to do by making it flower heavy and added a couple animals, but I digress.)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Beginner to buying Lego, so not sure of what might be rare or unique to the set.&nbsp; That being said, I&#39;m glad there is another set out there with a light brick.&nbsp; You can&#39;t have too many of these!&nbsp; It&#39;s one of the things that might justify the cost of getting this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is one part where I think they missed an opportunity to really sell the novelty of a set for all seasons.&nbsp; The male and female minifigures are dressed for Fall/Winter, but they look out of place in the Summer build.&nbsp; Not sure how many people are wearing pullovers (hoodies) and flannel shirts in the summer heat and at the pool.&nbsp; I would have included one extra top half for each figure to tie in the warmer months to really get behind the marketing here.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty basic.&nbsp; Nothing really stood out to me as being hard or difficult.&nbsp; It is actually primarily a basic build that caters more to &quot;novelty&quot; than anything else.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve only built the Summer season and at first I thought it was a little short-lived for the amount of money it cost, but after it was done I liked the fact that there was a grill that could light-up, a mower, a tree with fruit, and a small vehicle to accessorize the build.&nbsp; I&#39;ve decided that instead of it being a small house for the figures, it will be a pool house to go in the backyard of the #31012 Family House.</p>

<p>Some of these accessories will change in the coming months to a snow-blower, Christmas tree, pile of leaves, and the bird will change to a bat just in time for Halloween.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love the idea of changing the build to fit the season, but what I would have liked to have seen would have been the ability to pick one of three (actually four since Spring was omitted) builds AND then adapt each build to fit a different season.&nbsp; Instead, we have three different builds which reflect an individual season.&nbsp; No big loss, but maybe a recommendation on a future set?</p>

<p>Like I said previously, including two alternate clothing choices to fit the warmer months would have made the set better as well.&nbsp; My minifigures look out of place by the pool in a hoodie and flannel shirt.&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>At $49.99, I think it could have been a little more substantial, but overall for the &quot;novelty&quot; and the light brick... I&#39;m not going to gripe too much.</p>

<p>Sorry for the picture quality.</p>

"city_transport_rox","2015-12-16T00:07:34.653Z","Summer, Christmas or Halloween? ","<p>When i first saw this set it immediately caught my attention. First i just liked it because it was a Creator House that was not a log cabin of sorts. However, after a closer look i realised that this set is little more than just a regular house.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing too special here, the back of the box is nice which shows each house in its respective season. There are 3 instruction books with obviously one for each build as per usual in creator sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has over 500 parts. Many useful parts are included in this set and the first one I will point out is the red light brick. Light bricks are always good to add to your collection, and this set makes good use of it, especially in the Winter and Summer versions. Other notable pieces are another brick separater which always come in useful, a hot dog, orange minifig head, clear mug and green doors and windows and also some small glass windows.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Just the two minifigs with this one, nothing too special or new other than the girl has the light blue parts which are only found in a few sets. For the price, an extra minifigure would have been appreciated (maybe a mum minifig).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>All builds are fairly straightforward but fun to build anyway. All builds feature a good amount of exterior detail and also enough interior details for playability. Creator builds are better than City because there is more building and bricks rather than larger pieces.</p>

<p>I built the Winter one first as it is Christmas season and this one has a cozy interior, with the light brick used in the fireplace which is a great idea. This model is good because it is easy to access from the back, looks great and will go perfect with the City Advent Calendars or Winter Village Sets.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All models look good. Often with creator sets one or even two of the versions may not be worth building, but with this one they are all good and pretty even. My favourite one is the Winter/Christmas one followed by the Summer one, and the Autumn one is not too far behind either.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In Aus/NZ we pay a lot more for LEGO sets than the USA and this one was originally retailed for something like $80 at some stores. I was lucky enough to find it slightly cheaper but the price is extremely high for a fairly small house. However, on sale this set is definitely worth getting your hands on and of course it is a 3 in 1 so you can always change things around depending on the season.</p>
