<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A decievingly&nbsp;sized box! The final model is a lot larger than I would have though possible from the number of parts. Instructions included for all 3 builds which is fantastic, oh I wish Lego would do the same for Technic sets too!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice varied selection and the dark blue is a fantastic colour. A few Technic pieces but generally all great System parts with some very useful slope pieces and panels that are not so common yet.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll approach this in a three pronged attack, as there are 3 models to build!</p>

<p>The primary Power Jet is brilliant! The build is so clever to get the wing angles, which line up perfectly. Some serious brain power went into this design. The final model looks excellent, quite sturdy too. The only let down is the weak jet engine design at the rear which is just a rim with a trans-orange dish in it.</p>

<p>The Helicopter build leaves a fair few parts out, although it does look quite realistic but the build is not quite as inspiring as&nbsp;the Jet. No real clever angles, just a pretty simple build.</p>

<p>The final build, Speed Boat, is probably the weakest of the lot. An awful lot of parts left over, kind of flimsy rear wing section and the build is, well, just sticking brick after brick together. Yes, that is essentially all Lego is, but this model has nothing very interesting to it&#39;s build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>OK, the Power Jet, as I said multiple times above, is great! It looks fantastic, it plays well, it holds 2 minifigures (not included) and was a joy to build. After I built&nbsp;the 2 alternative models, I straight away put it back to the Jet because I loved it so much!</p>

<p>The Helicopter looks great as well. Maybe a bit less play time in this model, although it does too hold minifigures, but the scale is way out in this build. It&#39;s worth building this just for the experience.</p>

<p>The Speed Boat looks average, plays less than average (it doesn&#39;t float by the way!) as it doesn&#39;t really want to move on all but the smoothest of surfaces. I actually modified it with the left over pieces to add wheels underneath just so it could move. In all honesty, I wouldn&#39;t recommend anyone bother building this unless they really feel compelled to for &#39;completion-ness&#39;.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great A model, with weaker alternative models. That said the parts included, the price and the build experience all add up to a winner of a Creator set. Lots of playability and potential for custom creations too.</p>

"Evil_Pixie_Works","2016-06-18T10:07:54.027Z","Pixie in a Candy-Shop TIME!","<p>I may have been late in getting the &ldquo;Blue Power Jet&rdquo;, thankfully before it got discontinued, however I would have never been able to forgive myself considering I love the F-22 Raptor. More, I&#39;m into WW2 vintage aircraft, but I know Lego professes to stay away from &ldquo;War Toys&rdquo;, despite &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; and the endless evidence otherwise. Still, I&#39;d also never had opportunity to buy another Jet Fighter Lego. I&#39;ve only come back to Lego in the last 5 years or so after growing up with Lego from 1975. I&#39;d also never bought a 3 in 1 kit before, so I really didn&#39;t know what to expect &ldquo;inside&rdquo;. Clearly, I&#39;ve seen the &ldquo;Blue Power Jet&rdquo; several times and I&#39;ve avoided seeing any films on this kit because I knew the second I saw it... I wanted it. :-) Why spoil any surprises? I&#39;ve also been highly impressed with some of the newest designer work in making life and/or movie consent art in to the world of real world Bricks. Mainly I still really like the World of Harry Potter, but very few opportunity for any kind of vehicles. Also a fan of Star Wars, however most of the early Lego designs haven&#39;t been nearly as impressive as the later ones. I was lucky to have a passenger jet, but its far from scale. Just cant &ldquo;play easy&rdquo; with something that would be so very big, in scale. In so many ways, 31039 was a perfect Lego Storm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing like sitting in wait for a large Lego kit to come straight from Lego, checking the tracking every day to see progress, and then opening that brown box and knowing perfectly well what&#39;s inside and still feeling like a kid on Christmas morning. This was my feeling as I held the new kit in my hand with a big smile and dressed in my bed-clothes... as I would be, Christmas morning... several years ago.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Honestly? &nbsp;I was shocked and a bit horrified at the sight of this gigantic book that flopped on to my building table. &nbsp;Box was beautiful, the book&#39;s graphics were far better then in years past where you couldn&#39;t tell black from dark-bluish-gray. &nbsp;I know this is a &quot;3 in 1&quot;. &nbsp;I think it would have been far more justified to cut each build in to 3 lone&nbsp;books, just like some kinds come with multiple tiny books of the different builds. &nbsp;When the instructions are THIS big, the book becomes a hazard &quot;in the field&quot;. &nbsp;You can&#39;t easily prop it anyplace, under anything, and you are left to build 1-handed... and I&#39;m used to that by now. &nbsp;Never remember this issue when I was 5 to 10 years old, building.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Again, I didn&#39;t know what quite to expect slitting the box open. I saw a massive issue once I started looking for the numbers on the sides of all the different bags. Once coming back to Lego... I thought that was a BRILLIANT idea! Clearly, that way you don&#39;t have far too many bricks to search from... and I know others who love to lay on the carpet and rip all bags open and build like they did when they were children. However, I enjoy sitting on my sofa and building... and according to my aunt, she&#39;s amazed at the speed I can build. Speed aside, I find a numbered bag way far more enjoyable to ME.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also understand this is a &ldquo;3 in 1&rdquo; and this was was my first. I really don&#39;t understand why anyone would buy the same kit and want the other 2 designs... OR why not just buy multiple kits? I&#39;d love to see the &ldquo;Blue Power Jet&rdquo; displayed in my office! And I&#39;m a writer, not in the military. Clearly, as a child... you add, you modify as you play... or the kit becomes parts in an endless land of imagination. Where we instantly lost the instructions as a child, we save them passionately in case something happens to the kit in question.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was also another 2-3 times where I had serious problems being unable to find a brick I needed as it was so smartly hidden under a bigger brick. Numbered bags help that from happening, not to mention in a kit nearly 1k in brick size.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I honestly wish this category WOULD design and include&nbsp;Minifigures. &nbsp;Perhaps they have never considered it? &nbsp;Maybe they ignore the suggestions? &nbsp;I feel it would do the design justice, even staying away from the &quot;official use&quot;. &nbsp;Civilian&nbsp;Jet Pilots, 2x. &nbsp;Some day, maybe 20-30 years away, these will be at air shows, owned by private owner. &nbsp;Any air show today has jets that once saw hostile sky. &nbsp;So, I added a couple of TIE fighter pilots... for now.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Again, due to the size of the build and no numbered bags, my normal speed of building was slowed and sometimes hit a wall and frustration. &nbsp;Take a small break, come back, I did it in the same &quot;one sitting&quot; I build everything in. &nbsp;Still, I take my time, enjoy the build, as I build I try seeing the design from the designer&#39;s point of view. &nbsp;My aunt was suprised, again a kit so big, that it has no stickers... but I explained that as the same brick could be in the different designs and thus wouldn&#39;t fit-in that next design. &nbsp;In the same way, I feel just a little was lost in the detail. &nbsp;Not a lot!! &nbsp;Just a little.</p>

<p>One being in the &quot;Blue Power Jet&quot; hover intake flaps being wrong vs. the real thing, the F-22 Raptor. &nbsp;I had a really close look at a movie that has a good look at these intakes after enjoying my new toy... and the front flap is not front enough and the second should be split and opens sideways. &nbsp;They went through all the trouble to get so many details correct, yet missed something that could have been fixed so easily? &nbsp;Makes me wonder. &nbsp;I would have been shocked to see the main afterburner rotate as it does in life, but that wasn&#39;t even an options in the Lego design. &nbsp;That would be the one thing I would change. &nbsp;That&#39;s all.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It would be totally amazing to see a little Lego military air base with a handful of these &quot;Blue Power Jets&quot; all lined up, all in service, all waiting to keep the sky safe for all the Lego neighborhoods.&nbsp;Maybe in the next movie? &nbsp;:-<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only real disappointment cant be really avoided... the lack of a display stand. &nbsp;This jet looks wonderful on the ground and just as beautiful in the air or in a turn. &nbsp;However with so many options, it the turn for the &quot;Master Builders&quot; in us to sit down and work on a smart way to display our most favorite builds... because this is one of my most favorite builds and I&#39;m thankful I took the risk, time, and trouble to add this to my collection.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It always makes me laugh when you spent a few hours building a Lego kit so large and so complex and then look over at he box and see the ages Lego sets for people building them. &nbsp;I ask myself &quot;Could I build that went I was 10?&quot; and odds are, it may take days... or a week... but I never&nbsp;had&nbsp;that much time and I really wanted to see the finished product. &nbsp;A fine kid AND parent set... or kid and grandparent. &nbsp;Never a bad thing to share some time, build something or play a game, and listen about how the world was long before when a grandparent was your age. &nbsp;This kit... these are the kind of kits that are prime for that kind of opportunity. &nbsp;Me, alone, old enough, just seeing it in passing will remind me of all kinds of times now and memories long past. &nbsp;I sure do wish I had a lot more Lego in my life when I was a kid!</p>

<p>This kit? &nbsp;It would have been 5/5 perfect, less the point lost for the lack of brick division. &nbsp;I understand why they did it... doesn&#39;t mean I have to love it. &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;I love the build and it will never see the 2 of those&nbsp;3 designs. &nbsp;If I had a child? &nbsp;Yeah, he or she would have their own for sure!</p>
