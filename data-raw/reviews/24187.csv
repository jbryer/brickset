"Rocket4792","2015-07-28T20:25:12.577Z","A High Speed Purchase","<p>Hi welcome to my review of Lego DC Comics Superheroes 76034,&nbsp;<em>The Batboat:&nbsp;</em>Harbor Pursuit&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The front of the box is highly detailed to show the chase between Batman, Robin and Deathstroke. The back shows some of the features in the set. The set when opened contains 3 bags of parts, 1&nbsp;instruction manual, 1 sticker sheet, and one comic book. The comic is detailed showing parts from each set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set contains 264 parts. The only new parts I knew of were the Stud-Shooters, Batman&#39;s cowl and cape, Deathstroke&#39;s legs, Robin&#39;s cape, and Deathstroke&#39;s Super-Jumper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set contains 3 minifigures, Deathstroke, Batman, and New 52 Dick Grayson Robin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Deathstroke</u></strong></p>

<p>Deathstroke consists of a orange head with black-printing on one-side. He has a dark blue torso and dark blue arms and orange hands. His legs are two molded dark-blue and orange and have a orange waist. His weapons are two swords and a grey handgun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Batman</strong></u></p>

<p>Batman is the same as 76026. He has a black cowl with short ears. His head is black printed on both sides. His cape is black and uses the new soft fabric.&nbsp;He has Grey torso with printing resembling the new 52 suit. He comes with plain black legs unlike the one from JOKERLAND (76035). &nbsp;His weapons are a Batarang.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Robin</u></strong></p>

<p>Robin is based off the New 52 Dick Grayson version. He has Cole&#39;s hair in black. He sports Damian Wayne&#39;s head from 76013, and a black cape. His torso is brand new and as of thi review it is exclusive to this set. he has Black arms with dark&nbsp;green hands. He comes with dark green legs. This is the Robin I wish they would&#39;ve started this theme with.&nbsp;&nbsp;He has no weapons. I hope they release this version in another set later in the line, but different expressions.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build consists of the Batboat and Deathstrokes&nbsp;waterjet. Both models are easy to build and fun to play with. Bag one builds the 3 smaller vehicles. The Batpod, and Robinpod and Deathstrokes Jetski. Bags 2 and 3 build the Batboat which the Batpod and Robinpod connect to the Batboat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The models once built are very cool and fun. They are both decent-sized considering the set is $39.99 CAD. The Batboat is probably better than its&nbsp;predecessor considering its size and is still able to float.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This a really nicely designed set. He has alot of playability and 3 minifigures, two of which are exclusive as of this writing. I highly reccomend this set as it is a really great et and fits perfectly in with the rest of the Lego DC Comics Superheroes theme. Thanks for reading my review of Lego DC Comics Superheroes&nbsp;76034, <em>The Batboat:&nbsp;</em>Harbor Pursuit.</p>

"LegoHurtsMyFeetses","2016-07-02T19:37:05.467Z","Missiles, Mercenaries and a Master Console","<p>For my first ever Brickset review (Yikes!), I chose to review a set I recently acquired, 76034 Batboat Harbor Pursuit. Fitting right in with the other DC sets of the last year or so, this superheroes set features the now mandatory tropes of a super jumper, some seemingly randomly placed missiles and stud shooters and some interesting figures. But how do Batman and Robin fare against Deathstroke&nbsp;in the latest Lego Batboat?&nbsp;</p>

<p>76034 follows the now standard formula for superhero boxes. The DC Comics Super Heroes banner adorns the top of the box, with Batman&#39;s shadowy face lurking in the top right. Underneath this is an action shot of the two vehicles speeding headlong towards each other, weapons firing. The back showcases some of the play&nbsp;features from the set, as well as Batman assaulting Deathstroke on a CGI dock, which is fairly standard for DC sets.</p>

<p>Inside the box we are greeted by 1 instruction booklet and a sheet of various keypads and controls in sticker form (Argh, the Lego-builders bane!).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set includes 264 pieces, among which are some nice&nbsp;inclusions. Most notably, 76034 contains two large bat wings, attached to the set with a small technic bar. Also in the set are two dinghies&nbsp;in black and 2&nbsp;translucent&nbsp;jewels. So nothing too special, though I may have missed something.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Batboat Harbor Pursuit includes 3 figures, the mandatory Batman figure, Robin and Deathstroke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off, Batman. With the newer soft cape and the newer cowl without chinstrap, a pretty standard figure.</p>

<p>Secondly, Robin. With the regular height legs and floppy hair, this is most likely the Jason Todd version of the boy wonder. Equipped with a short black staff, this is one of the best, in my opinion, versions of the character.</p>

<p>Finally, the character who is probably the main draw for fans, Deathstroke finishes the trio. Deathstroke&nbsp;is decked out in an orange and bluish-gray colour scheme with a bandolier strung across his chest. Without anything adorning his head, Deathstroke only has a single sided head, and thus his only accessories are his dual katanas and blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The two models, in my opinion, are quite mediocre. Deathstroke&#39;s&nbsp;small jetboat&nbsp;has the same colour scheme as its rider. It is a simple build, constructed from the bottom up. The Batboat is also quite a boring build, with no truly creative or innovative techniques. Much of the build is just mirroring two halves, and the computer console in the centre is a strange inclusion, and it is here that many of the sets stickers are used.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed Harbor&nbsp;Pursuit fits in with the other sets in the DC range. The black colour scheme of the Batboat fits with the Dark Knight&#39;s countless other belongings, and the size fits well in with the rest of the range.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this model was alright, albeit a dissappointing build. Deathstroke and Robin, I think, are great characters but Batman has come in so many other sets that hs isnt a big draw. The Batboat itself is a good model, but for the random and flimsy console in the centre. Deathstrokes&nbsp;vehicle is nice, if not unoriginal. This set is not the best Batman set ever, but is not the worst, either.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T21:53:47.623Z","Behold Deathstroke!","<p><strong>Set #76034 The Batboat Harbor Pursuit: </strong>The second smaller wave of sets from DC in 2015 were once again centered around Batman, much to the delight of the fans as with this set we finally got a much requested villain in Minifigure form and with the other the Teen Titans got their debut, or at least some of them did. This being the smaller of the two sets we&rsquo;ll cover their good points and bad.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: The New Batboat design looks great and this box shows why as it comes speeding out from Gotham harbor in order to stop the deadly Slade AKA Deathstroke. It&rsquo;s an awesome looking action shot for the set, sadly this is a Boat won&rsquo;t Float for real deal which is unfortunate. The back again shows off the features of the set including the NEW Super Jumper, are we getting tired of this announcement yet?</p>

<p>Instructions: After so many sets broke the models up between manuals it&rsquo;s nice to find a set where once again you have a single large manual for building with. This means everything is here, the easy to follow along with colourful step-by-step guide, the parts list and the cross-promotional stuff, what little of it there is. You&rsquo;ll also find a sticker sheet here for there are no printed parts, everything is stickered.</p>

<p>Comic: The comic focuses on the two brand new sets for DC Super Heroes, Jokerland and this one. It&rsquo;s a very impressive looking comic, and with the Minifigure checklist on the back it&rsquo;s useful for keeping track of everything in the sets.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t a lot of parts here, but there are four of the black canoes, or rafts used traditionally in LEGO City sets. This makes the Batboat Harbor Pursuit set as a really good source of parts for people looking for unique elements in new colours to build up something fun in their MOCs. Nothing much else to report for parts here.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Batman: Pretty much the same design we&rsquo;ve seen in other 2015 sets, although I do believe this torso is a different iteration of the costume compared to the other Justice League sets from the early wave. What I find rather interesting is that this is the first set not to include any accessories for Batman, there are no Batarangs or anything else, I think you are meant to take the stud shooter off the main model and have him use it against Deathstroke, which is rather odd. I love the new cape piece they introduced this year, it keeps its shape so much better than the older ones.</p>

<p>Deathstroke: This is the big draw of the set, one of the most desireable villains for Teen Titan fans, and a member of Batman&rsquo;s rogue&rsquo;s gallery, Slade Wilson is a mercenary. His Minifigure features an impressively detailed double-sided torso print with orange gloves on a dark blue torso, which is a rare colour, his legs include dual molding, half dark blue the other half orange and his head is all orange with blue printing for one side of his mask. He includes a katana and a gun for his accessories, using the space gun naturally, and the back of his head features printing for the knot his mask uses to stay on.</p>

<p>What I find interesting about this Minifigure is that he&rsquo;s a truly unique print, he is to my recollection, the first Minifigure officially from LEGO with a bandolier of bullets printed on the front and back of his torso. That is truly a rare sight indeed and some might consider it to be against LEGO&rsquo;s core values, however as this is a villain character, it makes sense to see this detail on his torso.</p>

<p>Robin: This version gives us another new torso, and dark green legs for Robin, the double-sided costume print on him is pretty interesting, I believe it is meant to represent the costume worn by Damien Wayne. He includes a black hair piece which I believe is fairly new and sculpted quite nicely, his face is double-sided with a scared expression on one side and a determined gritty expression on the other. No accessories for him I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: Batman and Deathstroke are the first Minifigures to be built in this set, then help Deathstroke out by building his small boat and once that&rsquo;s finished begin construction of Batman&rsquo;s new Batboat. Everything in this bag is fast and quick to build, there is a bit of repetition involved as the start of the Batboat build is a pair of small identical builds that will be attached to the larger central portion of the model. However there is nothing difficult or frustrating during the build.</p>

<p>Bag 2: The central portion of the Batboat takes up this bag and it&rsquo;s a fairly involved build, a lot of small canoe pieces are being used as a foundation for a much larger craft, which is pretty interesting and unique compared to how the Batboat first came to be built in the original LEGO Batman theme. The only potential frustrating part is the placement of stickers for the control panels, other than that nothing is really difficult here.</p>

<p>Bag 3: Robin joins you now and with him you can finish building the Batboat by completing the central section, add detailing and a unique looking satellite sensor device as well as the fins Batman enjoys putting on every vehicle. There are a lot of stickers being put onto small pieces here, so be aware of that, otherwise enjoy the build as it is very quick and easy to follow along to finish off the main model.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Deathstroke&rsquo;s Boat: This little model is a nice little villain vehicle for Deathstroke to use in getting away with the safe, which is included with the model. Inside you&rsquo;ll find a pair of jewels. The model is built with some nice orange and blue colouring to match the costume worn by Deathstroke and includes a clip for his sword and gun to attach when he&rsquo;s steering. You also get two flick-fire missiles to target against the Batboat and the safe can be stored or dragged along from the back. Overall it&rsquo;s a fairly simple model but offers some fun.</p>

<p>Batboat: This is a clever and fun looking model that incorporates a lot of value for play features and still looks great as a display piece. The main boat is a large black vehicle loaded with charm and personality, you get two flick-fire missiles to shoot at Deathstroke and some stud launchers next to each cockpit. You might ask why? Well that&rsquo;s because this boat can separate, using twin technic axles you can launch both cockpit sections, which are built on small black raft pieces we&rsquo;ve seen in LEGO City before.</p>

<p>Both of these sections can now separate and launch a new combined assault from multiple angles to stop Deathstroke from escaping with his stolen goods. The main body of the Batboat can then raise a sensor array, with this up you can have Deathstroke use the Super Jumper piece to knock Batman&rsquo;s radar over and allows him to prevent Batman from tracking him when he makes good his escape.</p>

<p>Overall this model is a very impressive one and I&rsquo;m very thrilled at the overall design. I love the entire look of it, it&rsquo;s a huge improvement over the original Batboat from the 2006 Hunt for Killer Croc set. Both have their merits, however I feel that this slightly smaller model uses a lot better elements to capture the look of Batman&rsquo;s aquatic vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Once again I can&rsquo;t recommend this set enough, it is a very well designed and excellently crafted set from DC Super Heroes. It has some awesome Minifigures and works excellently which is what we&rsquo;ve come to expect from this Theme. At least until 2016 happened, but we&rsquo;ll get on that later. Strongly recommended and definitely worth the asking price.</p>
