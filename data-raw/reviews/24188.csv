<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Lovely artwork on the box with a&nbsp;standard manual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>1037 pieces and some very unique and colourful&nbsp;pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All 8 (10 if you include the clown and penguin henchmen) are fantastic.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pleasurable&nbsp;and fun build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Beautifully constructed rides. I&#39;ll be adding my own Bumper car ride to this set, using the Joker Bumper car polybag&nbsp;(30303)&nbsp;and substituting some of the green&nbsp;pieces with the appropriate colours for the other&nbsp;characters.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a fantastic and beautiful set. As the rides are all individual, you can chose which rides you want to include in the theme park. This will be a highly collectible set in the future. Sell your Fun House Escape and Two-Face Chase ASAP because this set trumps them both. I have&nbsp;over 100 Lego sets in my collection and this is the best so far.</p>

"alldarker","2015-07-03T14:51:44.817Z","All the Fun of the Fair... ","<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Lego seems to stagger the release of sets across the world: some sets which get released early in the US get a much later release in Europe, and at the same time, other sets get the earlier release in European countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">I was very&nbsp;happy&nbsp;to see set 76035&nbsp;Jokerland&nbsp;get the earlier&nbsp;release in Europe, as it was probably the Summer 2015 set I was most anxious to lay my grubby paws on.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Coulrophobia&nbsp;is an abnormal fear of clowns, and if you suffer from this, just looking at the box for&nbsp;set 76035&nbsp;Jokerland&nbsp;might give you a hard time. There&#39;s a lot going on in the picture, but the focus is on the giant clown&#39;s&nbsp;face that makes up the largest attraction in&nbsp;Jokerland. And it is not a happy clown.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">The picture on the front is a wonderfully colorful affair: the set seems to contain parts in all colors of the rainbow, and it looks very attractive on the shelf. It&#39;s definitely a set that looks like you&#39;re getting your money&#39;s worth.&nbsp;The box also shows the usual minifigure line up included: eight figures in total.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">The set doesn&rsquo;t really include too many spectacular parts: just a lot of parts in many colors. There are a couple of parts in new colors, like the two vertical beams in the Free Fall in light green and the shell halves in green.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">The set contains eight minifigs: not a bad figure at all for a licensed set. No less than three of these figures are female: Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and Starfire. Of the eight figures included, two have been seen before: both Poison Ivy and the Pinguin have appeared in exactly these versions in 10937 Arkham Asylum, and Poison Ivy was also included in the 6860 Batcave set. All other figures are as of yet unique to this set, although the Joker is practically the same version as the one in 76013 The Joker Steam Roller <em>(except with green hair instead of the hat)</em>. Probably the most interesting new figures are the two members of the Teen Titans: Beast Boy and Starfire. Beast Boy is just a great figure all round. He has a reversible head with two great faces: one awkward looking face and one scowling face. Also of note is his legs, which are &lsquo;overmolded&rsquo; like the cool kids say, in black with purple boots. It goes perfectly together with his purple and black torso. Beast Boy is &lsquo;accompanied&rsquo; by a green snake, to demonstrate his superpower: he is able to metamorph into animals <em>(all green, by the way)</em>.The second &lsquo;star&rsquo; of the set is Starfire. Her skin color is nougat: slightly darker than the usual flesh color, and it looks great on her. She has printed arms and printed legs, and her torso has the now relatively common &lsquo;female curves&rsquo; printed on.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Harley Quinn is another almost completely new figure, although we&rsquo;ve seen her in several versions before. Here, she is dressed in a rather unflattering but completely new red/black outfit with elaborate printing on both torso and legs, and with a new double-sided head. Instead of wearing a mask, here she seems to have overdone it with the black eye make-up, giving her &lsquo;crazy eyes&rsquo; fitting the character well, though.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Batman himself also gets another makeover: he now sports overmolded grey legs with black boots, a new torso and the cowl sans chinstrap, which does look good. Robin also is new: most notable are his short sleeved arms and the new torso. Although his face is not new, he does also get a new hairstyle&hellip;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">All in all, a nice selection of figures, especially with the inclusion of the Teen Titans, although I wouldn&rsquo;t have minded some other criminals included: all four of the included bad guys were last seen escaping from Arkham Asylum!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Contrary to many others sets which consist of several builds, the instructions are all contained in one single bound&nbsp;volume. Personally, I am not keen on Lego&#39;s&nbsp;modern adding-one-single-part-per-page&nbsp;style of&nbsp;instructions, but I guess Lego has done research into the attention-spans of kids and the amount of guidance they need. Anyhow, the instructions themselves contain no mistakes and are easy to follow. The build starts with a bag containing&nbsp;the smaller parts of the set, including the&nbsp;Jokerbot, the cannon and the tank. Next up is the&nbsp;Batmobile: this part of the set uses two more of the nine bags which are included in the set. After this,&nbsp;Jokerland&nbsp;gets built: Harley&#39;s Wheels of Fire,&nbsp;the Carnivore Free Fall, the&nbsp;Deadly&nbsp;Duckies&nbsp;all use&nbsp;one bag each, and last of all, the&nbsp;Jokerland&nbsp;&#39;Fun House&#39; takes up two bags of parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">No parts of the set are especially hard to build or even contain innovative building techniques. A couple of the&nbsp;attractions contain some technic&nbsp;construction, but it&#39;s&nbsp;all pretty easy and the sets are pleasantly varied in shape and color.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">All in all, this is a pleasant&nbsp;build, more than it is a challenging build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">The set consists of five major builds and several smaller builds&nbsp;<em>(the cannon, the</em>&nbsp;<em>Jokerbot</em><em>, the penguin&nbsp;minion and the toxic tank)</em>. To me, the &#39;star build&#39; is the&nbsp;Batmobile: finally we get a&nbsp;Batmobile&nbsp;which&nbsp;is definitely inspired by&nbsp;the one from the 1989 Batman movie, which is still my favorite version of the&nbsp;Batmobile.&nbsp;The missile launchers are integrated in the hood in a wonderful way and function&nbsp;perfectly, without too much&nbsp;compromise&nbsp;regarding the shape of the vehicle.&nbsp;The attractions in&nbsp;Jokerland&nbsp;are all fun, relatively simple&nbsp;constructions which look great,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;considering they all have been designed with the &#39;super&nbsp;jumper&#39; function in mind.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">For the Wheels of Fire,&nbsp;Harley&#39;s&nbsp;motorbike is set down the beam by&nbsp;hitting&nbsp;the sign, and this also is the case with the Carnivore Free Fall attraction, which drops once the sign has been knocked back. The Deadly&nbsp;Duckies&nbsp;attraction doesn&#39;t really have an obvious super jumper function, but I guess hitting Beast Boy, who is handcuffed in one of the&nbsp;duckies, counts, as it will probably knock him out of the duck.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-left:35.4pt;"">Actually, to be&nbsp;honest, the most disappointing part of the set might just be the main part with the clown head. It&#39;s the only part of the set which looks better in the pictures than it does in hand. It&#39;s a very shallow building, lacking any&nbsp;really&nbsp;interesting functions. It&#39;s tall, and the clown face looks pretty good but there&#39;s only a few places for a figure to stand, and the set seems to be designed only around the rather simple pleasure of&nbsp;being able to knock the Joker into the Toxic tank.&nbsp;It&#39;s easy to compare this&nbsp;building&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6857-1/The-Dynamic-Duo-Funhouse-Escape"">http://brickset.com/sets/6857-1/The-Dynamic-Duo-Funhouse-Escape</a>, but that Joker&#39;s Funhouse is a much more interesting build than&nbsp;Jokerland&#39;s&nbsp;main building is.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like to think that the best Lego sets, especially for kids, are the sets that contain &#39;an adventure in a box&#39;. They contain all the elements and figures to play out&nbsp;self-contained&nbsp;stories. This set is a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;example of such a set. Four good guys, four bad guys, a base for the bad guys and a very cool vehicle for the good guys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main point of criticism I&nbsp;can&nbsp;give this set is the fact that&nbsp;I feel it&#39;s a shame that this set contains so many elements of the&nbsp;Funhouse&nbsp;Escape set: four of the figures are the same and the theme of the funhouse itself is repeated. I would not have minded at all if this set would have replaced the Clown building with something a little less &#39;Joker-centric&#39;: for example, a haunted house featuring Scarecrow would have fitted perfectly here, and it would have allowed 6857 Funhouse to be added on to&nbsp;this set a little easier.&nbsp;Likewise, no less than six of the included characters were also included in the Arkham Asylum set. Some more love for characters which aren&rsquo;t as common would have been very welcome in this set, for example another Man-Bat or more inventive Joker goons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, seen as a complete and stand alone set, this one is a winner. It all looks good together, it has a lot of play potential and the figures are just great. As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is definitely&nbsp;the best Super Heroes set for 2015, easily beating off the competition from the somewhat lack&nbsp;lustre Marvel sets. i can highly recommend this set: 4 stars if you already own other larger Batman sets, and 5 stars if this is the only Batman set you ever get!</p>

"8BrickMario","2016-01-31T23:51:00.253Z","Who wants to go to this amusement park?","<p>Ever since I heard of a Jokerland set, I was excited. Has it delivered on its promise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is my third attempt to make this review, so excuse me if I&#39;m a bit curt here.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is nice, showing Jokerland against a sunset backdrop of a carnival. The instructions were clear as ever.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some nice parts here, like the lime green girders, bright green seashells, the pink doorframe, the purple arches and slide, and the azure plates used on the Duckies.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>To get them out of the way, I&#39;ll start by mentioning that Poison Ivy and the Penguin aren&#39;t new in the slightest, which is a real shame, especially since the same Ivy&#39;s been used since the beginning of the theme. Joker is a hybrid of his gangster suit and 2012 head and hair.</p>

<p>Batman:&nbsp;Almost a repeat, but adds exclusive dual-molded legs to give him boots.</p>

<p>Robin:&nbsp;Based on his Teen Titans design. He has a new torso with short sleeved arms and a short cape and spiky hair, which suit the design perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beast Boy: He&#39;s a nice figure, but could be better. I think his green skin is a bit too dark (bright green would be better), and his faces are odd, with one being a borderline evil grin and the other being a goofy worried face. His outfit looks great, though, and includes dual-molded boots. However, the only option for his transformations here is a simple snake.</p>

<p>Starfire: Easily the best figure in the set. I like how they took her&nbsp;<em>Teen Titans Go!</em>&nbsp;design and standardized it to match with normal minifigures. The hair and the costume&#39;s colors look great, and her bronzed skin has been represented nicely with a darker shade. Her solar-energy powers are shown with her green eyes and two dishes to place on her hands. Unfortunately, like Wonder Woman, her legs were so detailed that they had to be made in China, resulting in looser joints.</p>

<p>Harley Quinn: Why, LEGO, why? Okay, let me back up. This Harley is based on her appearance in the New 52 series (specifically, the cover of&nbsp;<em>Harley Quinn #1</em>, and it&#39;s mostly perfect. They&#39;ve altered her costume to resemble an acrobatic leotard more, which I actually like better, and her face cleverly includes outlined grey circles around her eyes to represent her dark makeup. She even has her jingle-bell collar and her boots! Her face is great, too, with one happy/evil expression, and an angry one. But...she has a hat. This almost ruins the minifigure for me, since she never wore a hat in the New 52. She wears her hair in pigtails dyed to match the hat, but she doesn&#39;t wear the hat itself. With the pigtails on the horizon and being used later for her&nbsp;<em>Squad</em>&nbsp;minifigure, I feel that this set was released too early and Harley took the blow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t very challenging, but some interesting techniques were used.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The first thing you build is the 1989 Keatoneque Batmobile, with its large front engine. It looks nice, and while the cockpit doesn&#39;t slide, it&#39;s easy to implement. Two spring-missiles have been cleverly hidden in the engine; pressing two discreet Technic ball pins on the top will fire the missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next, you build some supplemental objects for the Joker: A circus cannon that doesn&#39;t work well but looks nice, a cute clown robot minion, and the Toxic Tank.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harley&#39;s ride is next, and it works...sort of. Due to relying on gravity and force, sometimes the bike will rocket down the track, and sometimes it won&#39;t. The sign is the trigger, but it&#39;s best activated with your hands instead of the improbability of a Super Jumping minifigure. Robin hangs below the bike, with his cape in danger of being set aflame by the trash cans underneath, and then can be knocked down to safety.</p>

<p>Ivy&#39;s free-fall tower is next. It uses a nice sideways build for the seats, and it cleverly balances on top where the plant and sign are. Tipping back the plant will stop covering the tower and allow the ring to fall down to the bottom.</p>

<p>Penguin&#39;s Deadly Duckies is a nice ride. The simulated sharks in the &quot;water&quot; below are a bizarre and amusing touch, and the ride works nicely. Two of the duckies contain explosives, and one has a trapped hero. Gravity keeps it spinning nicely. The only downside here is that there&#39;s no real &quot;rescue&quot; or &quot;defeat&quot; feature here like the other rides.</p>

<p>Last is Joker&#39;s...what is this thing? It&#39;s apparently some sort of dunk tank, and is the mascot/centerpiece of the park. The hall of mirrors is a nice way of using space, and the Joker mirror on the back will line up with a minifigure placed in the entrance. The clown archway is pretty expressive, with eyebrows that can angle, and some knobs on the back. Two of them cause the geared eyes to spin in unison, and the third allows you to tilt the hat back and forth. There&#39;s an insert for the tounge, which is loose. Disturbing it will jostle the Joker balancing on it, and he&#39;ll go down the slide and into the Toxic Tank you place below.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a fine set. While the figures aren&#39;t as good as they should be, the playability and creativity in the models is great, and the set can easily be expanded to add more danger to the park. I&#39;d definitely recommend getting it.</p>
