The pegasus sleigh is much less exciting than the castle, but has some nice elements. Basically I think the sleigh itself is pretty cool, but the little building that comes with it is just so-so.</p>

<h3>Minidolls</h3>

<p>Two elf minidolls are included: Aira and Azari. There is also a light blue and magenta baby dragon.</p>

<h3>The Sleigh</h3>

<p>The sleigh is sturdily built and attractively designed in shades of purple, yellow, and white, with gold trim. There is comfortable seating for four minidolls, and a trunk attached to the back which can store small items, such as Azari&#39;s little map. I like the design of the stickers on the sides and seat cushions. The sleigh is pulled by two pegasi with lovely large silver wings and gold saddles (although it&#39;s not clear how/if the minidolls could ride them directly). One pegasus has blue eyes and a blue face tattoo, while the other has purple.</p>

<p>The neatest thing about the sleigh is that the white brick-built &quot;wings&quot; on the sides (which are very pretty) actually flap, by means of a technic mechanism inside and lever at the back. It functions very smoothly and makes it look as if the sleigh itself can fly directly (using magic - like maybe it&#39;s actually taking the pegasi for a ride instead of vice versa), which is kind of cool and fun to play with. The silver wings of the pegasi can also be flapped manually. Also the front of the sleigh can be positioned manually up or down - not sure what this is for, but perhaps it can function as a shield if the passengers come under attack?</p>

<p>Overall the sleigh makes an attractive display and is a fun, dynamic toy.</p>

<h3>The Windmill</h3>

<p>The set also comes with a little windmill on top of a small building. We have never seen the cartoon series, so I&#39;m not sure what exactly this is supposed to be - maybe it is referencing some significant scene from the show which is lost on us. The windmill is made up of four white wings and of course actually spins. There is a perch on top for the baby dragon. The stickers on the windmill look very babyish and hokey to me - really don&#39;t seem to fit the more sophisticated fantasy design I&#39;ve seen elsewhere with the Elves theme. Underneath there is a small room/cave-like place (it looks as if it is supposed to made out of rock), with a secret entrance in the back that opens up with a hinged door. Inside the cave is a large lavender key (or weapon?) of some sort - we couldn&#39;t figure out what this is exactly, but it appears to be something hidden that the elves are searching for. There are also three inexplicable yellow grill pieces on the floor of the cave, and a bump tile as if something else can be situated there as well - perhaps the baby dragon guards the key? Outside the cave is a little waterfall and pool, with a strange silver fish on a hinge that can be made to dive through an opening into the pool.</p>

<p>Also included in the set is a small signpost with directions pointing to the four power elements represented by the Elves.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I think this set is worth having for the very nice sleigh, but the windmill doesn&#39;t add much for me. It&#39;s a bit fun to be able to hide things in the cave and retrieve them through the back door, but spinning the windmill doesn&#39;t really do anything, and the diving fish thing is just weird. I&#39;d highly recommend Ragana&#39;s Castle over this one as a playset (obviously at a much higher price point), but this is nice if you&#39;re looking for a fantastical elf vehicle.</p>
