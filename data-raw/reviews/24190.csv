At 808 pieces for $79.99 (~9.9 cents per piece), many viewed this set on par with expectations, at least monetarily, and marveled at its beauty. There is no doubt about it, this set is beautiful with its brilliant portal, golden-winged Pegasus, the Mysterious Skyra,&nbsp;and inviting&nbsp;color palette.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has all the trappings of the typical Elves box, with its blue leafy background and the main elves themselves lining the right side of the front. These Elves theme boxes are truly beautiful, Skyra&#39;s castle has a beautiful mountain range backdrop, a painted lava flow, and the back of the box has the much-needed map painted under the feature photos.</p>

<p>Just looking at the box is enough to draw you in to wanting to built this set. The aforementioned portal looks amazing, the castle looks imposing, and turning the box over to the back, you can get a feel for the many play features included with this set. There are mysterious sliding staircases, the aperture of the portal opens and closes (assumedly to get Emily home), a sliding water wall, and even a table for having a snack with friends before hopping through that portal. Portal travel probably makes one hungry.</p>

<p>Upon opening the fairly large box, it is&nbsp;jam-packed with 7 numbered bags, and a plastic and cardboard protected instruction book and sticker sheet. The instruction book is quite heftier than I had anticipated, to be honest, which makes&nbsp;the set feel even more luxe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t too many parts that are new to just this set. But there are, of course, parts that can only be found in Elves sets, such as the colored keys.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unique to this set are the purple columns that adorn the castle adding structure and regal color. There are 10 of those in this set, and I honestly hope they make an appearance elsewhere&nbsp;because they are truly beautiful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The golden Pegasus wings are also unique to this set, as those found in Aira&#39;s Pegasus Sleigh are silver,&nbsp;and I can see applications for those beyond horseback.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than that, there are 808 pieces in this set which come in a variety of hues, both &quot;girly&quot; and &quot;regular&quot;. The main color of the castle is Brick Yellow, but there are really lovely Bright Yellowish Green, Bright Reddish Violet, Lavender, and Medium Lilac accents throughout the main build. There are plenty of fun trans-clear pieces to be had as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this set you will find three minidolls-- Skyra, Naida, and Emily Jones. Skyra is the only minidoll that is unique to this set, and she is beautifully made. She has on a white gown with golden accents. Her lavender hair is styled beautifully in such a way that her complex cape fits very nicely. Speaking of her cape, it&#39;s a two-piece deal, created of a white upper piece to fan around her head, and a long purple cape that is made of the new stretchy material. It&#39;s quite soft and nice. Skyra also has a bejeweled golden staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Emily and Naida aren&#39;t new to this set and are both wearing their standard Year 1 gear, but have capes. Emily has a map as an accessory.</p>

<p>Also included in this set are a the Pegasus and an owl. The Pegasus, named Golden Glow, is very beautiful. The horse body in this design is unique to this set, with its golden mane and tail. The owl is also unique to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is relatively simple, the castle comes together in small stages, and each stage has an elemental theme. So first you build the Earth portion, which appears to be a small vestibule or entrance to the castle (though it is in no way attached). Next you build the central portion which contains solely flowers, and seems to be a natural continuation of the Earth entry way... if only they were attached...</p>

<p>Next portion is the Fire portion, which seems to be a kitchen complete with fiery stove baking up some cookies. And Skyra&#39;s Mysterious Staircase, of which it appears a play feature is that the staircase moves. To me, this was more of an annoyance than a play feature (Rapunzel&#39;s Creativity Tower suffered from this same thing), and I anchored the bottom stair from moving&nbsp;with a red 1x1 plate underneath it, which held the entire staircase in place. &nbsp;Directly above the lava kitchen appears to be the Throne room with some semblance of a throne for Skyra to get some much-needed R&amp;R &nbsp;on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then you move on to the Water portion of the castle, which is naturally a spa room, with the play feature of a sliding wall of water. Above the spa is Skyra&#39;s&nbsp;study, where a desk holds a quill and a letter. The owl waits to carry her letter off to whomever Skyra writes to. The price of stamps is probably cheaper with Owl Mail.</p>

<p>These sections all attach to each other and are hinged, allowing different looks. Building the castle in sections really helps break up the build and, for little hands, makes it much more accessible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the build wraps up with the portal section of the castle. Situated on a sort of balcony, the portal has some pretty clever mechanics. The elemental&nbsp;keys flanking the portal have nothing to do with whether it opens or closes. The column directly in front of the portal does, and with a twist of Skyra&#39;s&nbsp;staff or scepter, it opens and closes, allowing Emily to go home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>In a way, I was underwhelmed&nbsp;by the completed model. For its price and the sheer beauty of it on the box, I expected it to be a little larger and perhaps more... magical? Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the little details. The fact that there is a room in the castle devoted to each of the elements was really lovely and tied the whole first year of the theme together nicely. But because of the way the portal is constructed, the back side of the castle becomes virtually unusable as a play space, because it&#39;s ugly mechanics. It&#39;d be like playing behind the scenes at Disney, the magic isn&#39;t where the mechanics that make the ride work are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two improvements I would make (and have made) to this castle immediately: 1) stop the stairs from sliding around because they never unfold just right and as a play feature, folding stairs are rather blah and 2) attach the Earth portion to the front of the castle because it fits perfectly, with its waterfall on the right hand side. Without this portion on the front, the castle feels incomplete.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, this is a really beautiful build. Though there are 808 pieces, it feels like a whole lot more when they&#39;re all dumped into a container to build. And (probably due to my method of dumping all pieces from all bags into a single container pre-build) it takes a while to complete this build, so watching it come together room by room and element by element is really nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of the uniqueness of the Elves theme, I can see kids of all genders having hours of fun playing with this set after it&#39;s been completed, going on missions and saving each other, and perhaps having a snack at Skyra&#39;s&nbsp;table.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Though it&#39;s on the expensive side, I would say that Skrya&#39;s Mysterious Sky Castle is a must-have for any fan of the Elves theme. It is loaded with play features, is the only place to get Skyra, and is just plain gorgeous. The biggest draw of this set, the&nbsp;portal is cleverly constructed, and simply beautiful-- as is the entire castle.&nbsp;This is one&nbsp;of those sets that while it&#39;s a children&#39;s toy, and children will have a blast playing with it, it&#39;s also just a beautiful set to display and modify for any fan of Lego. In my opinion, this set is a must have.</p>

"Azure_sea","2017-08-30T16:50:33.623Z","Generally great","<p>At the time of first seeing this set me and one of my friends where very excited saying both of us would get it at it&#39;s release. Although I had already collected all the sets that include the elemental keys, my friend hadn&#39;t he thought it would only include Naida&#39;s water key, but the thing is it includes all four of the time blades this is where the set soars unlike some sets.</p>

<p>Not just that the portal is beautiful at least from the front, the back is so ugly.</p>

<p>I liked the integration of using the elements to progressively move through the castle but the integration of the elements was less than perfect, I personally feel the integration of the element of air/wind was rather lacking.</p>

<p>The mini doll selection was great with the beautiful Skyra and her Pegasus as well as Emily and Naida.</p>

<p>Generally Great!</p>
