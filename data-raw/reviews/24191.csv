<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Your standard friends box with standard instructions, nothing special.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Where to start with the goodies? Inverted tan slopes, postcards, slopes in a rare color, masonry bricks and of course the new decorative tan elements and the transparent accessory holders. Al in all a great selection of parts</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A friends minidol. I always give these to my nieces so I&#39;m not sure what to tell you about it&#39;s particularities.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It is a straightforward build, nothing overly complex.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A surprisingly good model. This would fit right at home at any park or even small train station (just change the green plates for grey). Combine to back to back to create an ever better model which would do well as a kiosk on a grand square.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>You can not go wrong with this set. Whether you build city, castle, friends or just about any other theme (excluding space maybe) this set provides some great parts!</p>
