<p>We&#39;ve had quite a few of the smaller friends sets, over the last year, but this is the biggest one.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice selection of parts, in white, medium azure, bright light orange, and magenta. The stickers add a few nice flourishes to the model</p>

<p>Like a lot of planes/helicopters, it includes the large nose/tail sections, which make building easier, and also add a lot to play-value - quick and easy to remove, to add/remove the figures</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Comes with two - Olivia and Matthew (our first male Friend!)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing too difficult - Mr 5 1/2 built it in around 35mins</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a small passenger jet, it&#39;s laid out well.. only 2 seats for passengers, but they have nice arm rests, and there&#39;s a TV to watch.. The toilet/bathroom at the back is only accessible by lifting the tail section off.</p>

<p>The Luggage X-Ray machine is very nifty - load on the bags/laptop, and slide them through the flap</p>

<p>The only downside is the crazy-small tail (or to be precise - Horizontal Stabilizer!)&nbsp;- seriously, it&#39;s far too small, and looks a bit silly.</p>

<p>I expected the 2 white 3x6 wings were to be the tailplane, and both of us laughed, when we got to the stage of the instructions that attached the tiny 3x3 triangle pieces</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a fun little build - good value, and apart from the tailplane, it really looks quite good, and is very swooshable/playable</p>

<p>Also shame it doesn&#39;t come with a pilot!</p>
