<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is like any other LEGO friends set. The 5 main characters are up in the corner.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are tons of new parts and colors for pieces such as:6114987,&nbsp;6112306, 6107874, 6107202, 6107204, 6109971, 6109972, 6109931, 6109933, 6107187, 6115808, 6107742, 6107741, 6038163, 6107209, 6107743, 6112307, 6107208(this does not include minifigures). The price per piece is good to at $129.99, this set has 1,552 pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures,</h3>

<p>NATE: Nate&#39;s torso is great. It is anew print and really makes him look like a bell hop. He includes pants that match his torso that have been used in the Disney Princess line once before. He includes black hair as well as his hat son you can change is appearance (slightly).</p>

<p>SUSAN: Susan includes a new skirt and shirt that make her look like a manager. She also has short, curly hair. The new skirt is a reprint of Olivia&#39;s mom&#39;s. The only difference is the skin color.</p>

<p>OLIVIA: Olivia has a new shirt that looks almost exactly like her old one.The difference is that her new one has more hearts and a white shirt underneath. She has a standard skirt that is purple and no new face or hair.</p>

<p>STEPHANIE:&nbsp; Stephanie has a skirt that has been used before many times. She also has a bikini with a lay printed on that has been used once before. To cut it short, there is nothing new about Stephanie.</p>

<p>ANDREA: Andrea has a white shirt with a necklace printed on it.She has her normal face and hair and has tan pants. She, like Stephanie, has nothing new about her.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun and enjoyable. There were, however, a few times I felt board, because most of the exterior is symmetrical. I also didn&#39;t care for the 30 stickers they included in the set! It was a pain to put the ones on the clear translucent pieces that were used on the elevator. I will say that the finished product looked good with them on but 30 stickers are a little to much! I did enjoy building the interior of the hotel. Especially the 2 bedrooms.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks really nice. I like the modular design and all the interior. This set has tons or possibilities for play. There are tons of play features such as the working elevator. The elevator is a little rackety if you don&#39;t put all the pieces on completely straight, which makes it a little harder to move, but it still works fine. I like all the details inside such as the piano. The outside looks great too. I love the taxi too, however there is no steering wheel. Personally, I think the set is great!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>
