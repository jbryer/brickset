"KingAlanI","2016-02-01T03:22:41.513Z","Great introduction to the Pop Star subtheme","<p>I got this set half off, and wanted to build it myself because the theme reminded me of my Lady Gaga phase. The dog is a cute touch by itself and reminds me of hers. The arch looked novel.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I love the packaging. The countours on the end and the shinier printing in some places stand out. I can open one end without destroying the box. This is the first time I&#39;ve built a set with numbered bags, which really does help organize a build. Like many sets, I wish the instructions laid flat. It was cute to show a minidoll opening the set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There were a lot of cool pieces, but many small or limited use ones.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I like the more realistic look of Friends minis, thoguh I wish they would stay put sitting down, and it was a bit hard to attach both skirt tabs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was fun and not too easy or hard to build, but I have some minor problems with the design.</p>

<p>Overall, the mirror area was too crowded, especially when pick up and put down with the finished space. Why couldn&#39;t the cabinet have two drawers? I ended up with a lot of loose accessories. The chair can&#39;t turn fully with the cabinet in the way and the counter immediately above it. I decided to move the chair one stud to the left and raise the counter by one plate. I would have liked more color on the chair. The back wall used multiple small pieces where fewer large ones would have fit. I especially would&#39;ve liked some 2x2 corners instead of more 1x1&#39;s and 1x2&#39;s.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When folded, the model was easy to carry and looked good when not in use. The different ways of unfolding should expand play options.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It seemed promising on the shelf and playing with it confirmed my interest in the subtheme.</p>
