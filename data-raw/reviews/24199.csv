<p>As with most of my reviews, this is a small set and comes in LEGO&#39;s smallest regular box size. The artwork is bright and action-packed without being remarkable.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s only 97 parts in the set and none of them are particularly unusual. However, what parts are included are mostly in nice neutral grays and dark blues.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s where this small set really shines. Three unique figures are included:</p>

<p>Spider-man - I&#39;m told this is the &#39;Miles Morales&#39; version, hence the black and red motif instead of Peter Parker&#39;s blue and red traditional outfit. Spider-man&#39;s always a good figure to have around because you can hide him on any modular building for an easy laugh. Personally, I think I prefer the more traditional outfit&#39;s coloring but this is still a nice alternative.</p>

<p>Carnage -&nbsp; I&#39;m not a Spider-man guy at all but even I was excited to get Carnage. This guy is built from red parts with a black spinning clip on the back for his tentacles (or are they webs? Or spines??). There&#39;s some question about the consistency of the plastic/printing with this figure. Some people on Reddit have reported that the paint can be transparent in places but that&#39;s not the case with my figure.</p>

<p>The big gnarly grin and full body patterns are fantastic and his head piece can be used with other helmets and in other configurations for very creepy results.</p>

<p>Shield&nbsp;Agent - This is the only generic figure in the set but they&#39;re still unique. The printing is great (perhaps they&#39;re a touch muscular) and you get smiling and scared face prints (from memory). The SHIELD logo is incorporated on the chest, which is nice.</p>

<p>Detailing aside, I like this figure as a generic SHIELD operative. I don&#39;t think &#39;agent&#39; is quite the right word, given they&#39;re clearly a pilot, but they&#39;re engaging and come in a cheap set so you should be able to stock up on a few if you have a big scene in mind.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>After the excitement of the figures the build is rather plain. All the remaining pieces (sans super-jumper) are used to construct a single-seat little jet. The design is reminiscent of the quinjets used in the Age of Ultron movie which is nice and the way the jets are attached to each side is mildly interesting (they spin when touched when you would expect them to be rigid).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As discussed above, the completed model is a simple, yet engaging, jet. Though not particularly exciting by its self, adding a few of these to a larger scene would be great. Also, in lieu of any specific action feature, the jet has numerous external bars and clips that the characters can attach to. I like this.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t know if there&#39;s a technical term for them but recent sub-150 piece superhero sets have all had something going for them and this is no exception. In fact, this is one of the most impressive to date.</p>

<p>The three figures are unique and strong and the limited piece count is directed entirely into one fun (swooshable) build. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76029-1/Iron-Man-vs-Ultron"">Iron Man Vs Ultron</a> set was a poor build but great Ultron army troop building set, <a href=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/76010-1.jpg?201311020432"">Batman: The Penguin Face&nbsp;off</a> was light on minifigures but strong on printed parts. This set has great mini</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2016-03-22T22:23:35.113Z","One of Marvel's Best","<p>It is easy to criticize Marvel sets for their constant use of odd jeeps and airplanes which seem as a method to sell minifigures; but this small $12 set bucks that trend by not only offering figures that are interesting, but a vehicle that logically fits into the Marvel universe.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Dark blue is a spectacular color for parts, and here is no exception. There is also two printed tiles which represent the motor fans used by the small VTOL aircraft. There is also a super jumper; which I will not be using with my figures.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The three minifigures are comparable to the quality of figures seen in larger Marvel sets, and are all spectacular.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Miles Morales - Spider-Man;&nbsp;</strong>I don&#39;t read many comics, but from what I can find on Google, Miles became Spider-Man in an alternative universe after Peter Parker was killed. His suit is rather nifty, especially because it offers an alternative design to the common Spider-Man outfit. For those not looking for a %100 recreation, this minifigure could be used to represent Peter Parker when he was infected by the Venom parasite in the comics and the film&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 3</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Carnage:&nbsp;</strong>Again, not being a comic fan all I know about Carnage is that he is a violent version of the Venom parasite that is colored red. Lego&#39;s figure is spectacular, with black printing on the torso and arms of the figure, The backpack with tentacles is a little cumbersome though.</p>

<p><strong>Shield Agent/Pilot:&nbsp;</strong>Probably one of the biggest selling points to the set is the generic Shield Agent offered. His head is identical to one of the figures used in the Ghostbuster&#39;s sets. He seems to be begging to be re-used in MOC&#39;s representing the MCU. I will be using him as a pilot for my Quinjet from 2012, and it is tempting to Bricklink multiples to begin amassing a collection of Shield Agents.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple and should not be surprising to an experienced builder; but is still satisfying to assemble.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The little VTOL aircraft just looks good. It captures Shield&#39;s obsession with airplanes that can take off vertically (they even have a car that is VTOL equipped in the ABC&nbsp;TV series!), and looks like a smaller cousin&nbsp;to the Quinjet. I can see a small group of these escorting Quinjets; or taking off from a Helicarrier.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is extremely well rounded, and is also at an affordable price. What is not to love? An instant 5 star set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T15:32:57.007Z","Carnage for Spidey's Rogues' Gallery","<p><strong>Set #76036 Carnage&rsquo;s SHIELD Sky Attack: </strong>Another Ultimate Spider-Man based set, this time introducing the Mile Morales looking outfit for Spidey, which is a really nice new print. Definitely a fun little set, especially for fans of Spider-Man and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: It&rsquo;s a small box with a fun action shot of the set on the front and play feature shots on the back, mostly relegated to the NEW Super Jumper! It is what it is for a box this size, definitely a fun looking set due to the nature of the model.</p>

<p>Instructions: Quite standard instruction sheet with very little in the way of cross promotional images, easy to follow for the build, and features a parts list at the back of the book. Not much more to say really.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts situation with this set is fairly minimal, the biggest thing it has going for it are the large circular plates in yellow and dark blue with the hole in the middle&hellip; I believe they are commonly referred to as donut pieces and featured quite prominently for the first time at Bag End. The colouring here is quite nice though, dark blue is fairly rare while yellow isn&rsquo;t entirely.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Carnage: Carnage is highly detailed with leg printing and arm printing showing the roiling freakish appearance of the character that is covered in a red Symbiote. His facial print is very frightening as well and looks similar, but not identical to Venom, which is as it should be.</p>

<p>Much like Venom he has a back bracket to attach the circular four clip piece which features four red tentacles lashing out. It&rsquo;s not the worst idea, and makes more sense for Carnage who tends to fight with sharp dangerous weapons formed out of his own skin, but it does mean that Carnage and Venom not only look very similar, but come with the same accessories and are quite back heavy, making them difficult to stand.</p>

<p>SHIELD Agent: Featuring your standard SHIELD uniform printing this Minifigure is a great generic soldier to stand alongside Maria Hill and Nick Fury, he has a solid looking print with the SHIELD symbol on his upper chest and belts and pouches as well for accessories. His head is double-sided with a smiling sort of out-of-place secret agent expression and a mouth open in terror as Carnage attacks expression.</p>

<p>He includes a pair of handcuffs and a standard LEGO double-barreled gun for accessories and a generic black helmet head piece which is unfortunate, a spare hair piece might have been nice for when he&rsquo;s not flying the vehicle. Again no leg printing.</p>

<p>Spider-Man: Representing the character of Miles Morales as Spider-Man, this Minifigure is a great change of pace and coloring compared to the typical Spidey Minifigure, it does have a few minor flaws though. There is still no leg printing, or arm printing and he doesn&rsquo;t include any webbing accessories to use against Carnage.</p>

<p>What is here is a nicely detailed double-sided torso print and a great looking mask print on a black Minifigure head piece. The red on black webbing looks so nice it&rsquo;s a real shame LEGO did not choose to include it on the legs or arms.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>What you build in this set is a small hover craft with SHIELD markings and the build for the model is a relatively quick and simple step-by-step style build that doesn&rsquo;t include any difficult parts or elements. I would note that stickers are used sparingly for details and perfectionists may want help in applying them just right so they look good, other than that nothing stands out as fairly clever, aside from the fun use of the donut pieces for the hover engines.</p>

<p>That aspect of the build really stood out for me as being fairly fun, in spite of the stickers used for the hover rotors rather than using actual rotors for the engines.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>This little model is great, and that&rsquo;s mostly because of the colours and the fact that there is no compromising elements for the Super Jumper play feature to destroy. Unlike other sets this model comes with a Super Jumper, but does not feature something for you to aim at and hit to easily knock off a piece of the model or send a character flying. It even has a nice storage area for the spare ammunition for the stud shooters found on either side of the cockpit.</p>

<p>My one complaint, aside from using stickers for details, is that the cockpit interior is sparsely designed and the pilot has a very difficult time of sitting properly to reach to two control rods. The cockpit window/canopy is also a bit oversized and doesn&rsquo;t necessarily lock in very well once the pilot is situated. It is however a very fun little vehicle to play with and includes two stud launchers for younger builders to enjoy action scenes with.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Compared to the Iron Man vs. Ultron set from this same year I find this to be the stronger of the two 15.99$ sets, the Minifigures and the model are much better defined and work quite well and the Super Jumper can easily be ignored if you choose to. The only issues anyone might find with this set are the use of stickers for details, at this point Marvel Super Hero collectors should be used to this issue though. It is a shame that this set only features three Minifigures while the aforementioned Iron Man one includes four for the same price&hellip; However I don&rsquo;t really see who else could have been included here with possible exception to a second SHIELD Agent.</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>

"Wookiesmasher13","2016-06-10T14:32:24.653Z","A Nice Addition to my Marvel Collection","<p>Box/Instructions &nbsp; It&#39;s a normal box. There are some action scenes on the back.</p>

<p>Parts &nbsp;A very nice selection, but mine lacked about &nbsp;fourth&nbsp;or third of the printing on the &nbsp;rotor. I&#39;m not sure if this is &nbsp;common issue or just mine.</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp; &nbsp; The reason I bought the set, the minifigs&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Miles Morales is an alternate universe Spider-Man and really looks better than the original. He makes a good addition to the Spider-Family and is the secondary reason I bought the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;SHIELD Agent : I don&#39;t know wht to think about him. He has decent printing and a rare black double pistol. BUT he isn&#39;t very impressive alone. He needs duplicates to make a group of SHIELD Agents.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The reason I bought the set, The Carnage Symbiote. He looks impressive and is a good counterpart to Venom. I would like to see an Anti-Venom and Agent Venom, but having these two is a good start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build &nbsp;I don&#39;t understand&nbsp;what it is supposed to be, but it is sturdy and took me about 15 minutes. It has 2 storage clips and some ammo storage behind the cockpit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model &nbsp;This is the set Lego needs to model others after. It is impressive and has a great selection of minifigures.</p>

<p>Overall opinion &nbsp; I love this set, and it&#39;s minifigures. I recommend this set if you can find it.</p>

This set is the smallest of a mini wave of sets released a while back. The mini wave included: Sandman and Rhino Super-Villain Team Up, Antman: The Final Battle and this set. Even though it is the smallest, it is by no means the weakest. In fact, it may be the most sound of the three.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Box and Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is fairly small, the front showing Carnage attacking the SHIELD hovercraft with Miles Morales jumping to the rescue. The back shows the hovercraft landed and Miles and the SHIELD agent battling Carnage on the rooftops. The instructions are typical instructions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Parts</strong></p>

<p>Lots of dark blue pieces with a smattering of butter yellow. Some really cool pieces, like the 2x2 round tile with the hole in the middle. These pieces are cool enough as it is, but these come printed with propellers on them! Seriously awesome. Plus you get a cool windscreen and some stud shooters.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5ei2ueuhf/10.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures.</strong></p>

<p>There are three mini figures in this set your typical 12-14 dollar set. I&rsquo;ll start with the SHIELD agent. It&rsquo;s always nice to get a non-super for the heroes to rescue. The only complaint that I have with this minifigure is his happy face. I know that other people have this same complaint because he doesn&rsquo;t look serious enough to be an elite agent. I do like his scared face, though. Complaining done, the rest of this minifig is stupendous. His torso has a white belt and straps over a dark blue jumpsuit. The color scheme and straps make it look very similar to a suit the Miles himself wears for a briefly in the comics. His legs are plain dark blue with a white waist. The back of his body has the belt and straps continued plus some lighter blue contour lines. His helmet is the flight helmet that has been used many times before in Space Police, Dino and other themes like that, but I think it suits him well. He has no visor. His face is a re-used Ghostbusters face and, again, it&rsquo;s a little too happy. His accessories are a pair of handcuffs and a double barrel gun&hellip;but wait! Before you groan about overused guns: the gun is the semi-rare black version, so that makes it better than the normal gray.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/j2y2w1qdv/6.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Carnage: This minifigure is brilliant! The detail level is stunning and he looks so much cooler than regular boring old Venom. He has printing on the front and back of his body, leg printing, printing on the front and back of his head AND printing on his arms! He comes with red seaweed pieces as his tentacles and a pack to clip then to, like Venom had in the Spider Cycle Chase set. The tentacle pack can get in the way when you play with him, but that can be forgiven since it looks so good. His face is super scary, leering Jack-O-Lanternesque mouth and weird winglike eyes. The rest of his printing is suitably alien. He&rsquo;s got stringy muscles with nasty slimy looking lines. All in all, a superb minifigure and a blood chilling enemy for Miles or Spider-Man (Peter Parker)</p>

<p>Mile Morales: sweet and simple. His suit doesn&rsquo;t have a whole lot of detail, but in the comics, he doesn&rsquo;t, so it&rsquo;s perfectly accurate. I really enjoy the black and red color scheme. And I especially like the spider on Miles&rsquo; back. It doesn&rsquo;t look like a fat tick!! That&rsquo;s the one complaint I have about Peter&rsquo;s suit. His spider on his back looks like a fat tick, not a spider. Come on Peter! You could do better! Anyway, back to Miles. His head printing is exceptionally good as well as his torso printing. His eyes are a different shape than the regular Spider-Man&rsquo;s and the red webbing on the front and back of his head matches well. His torso sports a large scary looking spider on the front and back, plus more red webbing and muscles (a super-hero staple). Miles is a great addition to any super heroes collection and a refreshing change from the same old Spider-Man that we all have thirty of. If you want to customize him to have no mask, all you need is Cyborg&rsquo;s face and Finn&rsquo;s hair.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build was fun and surprisingly clever for such a small vehicle. You build it in five separate parts: the two propeller assemblies, the cockpit, the middle section and the tail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The completed model looks fantastic! It&rsquo;s sort of a mini Quinjet , but with the slight look of a helicopter. There is two stickers, one on the tail and one on the windscreen. The one on the tail is nice, showing the SHIELD symbol and the words &ldquo;AC-82&rdquo;. I have no idea what that means, but it&rsquo;s cool. It&rsquo;s also pretty easy to stick it straight on the piece. Now, the one on the windscreen. It looks ok but I think it&rsquo;s a little weird that there is a computer display on the outside of the cockpit. A tile with the same sticker inside would have been better, in my opinion.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5h1yh8y4z/12.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>On the front, there is two stud-shooters and behind the cockpit there is a box with extra stud ammo, which is nice.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/99lgwzdn7/9.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>The sides sport two clips, one one each side, for holding the agent&rsquo;s gun and handcuffs. Underneath the propellers there are jet nozzles of some sort. They look pretty good, but they do rattle around a bit, which may or may not annoy you.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/7kcdowxxv/11.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s another jet on the tail of the craft. On the front, next to the stud-shooters, there are multiple lights, so the agent can light up the scene of the crime/battle (your choice). Inside the cockpit, the craft would be steered by two joystick controls. The agent can&rsquo;t actually hold them, but it&rsquo;s nice detail anyway. It&rsquo;s not one of those vehicles that seemingly has no way to steer it. The sides of the cockpit are open, but it looks fine and adding sides would have brought the piece count up too high.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/v7hxqrsnn/8.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>FINAL VERDICT</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Miles</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SHIELD agent</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carnage</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awesome little hovercraft</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great Price</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cool Pieces</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong>: The Sticker on the windscreen</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Agent is too happy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At $12.00 this set is a steal! Especially with three mini figures. You may want to consider buying more than one for extra agents and hovercrafts. 5/5 stars. One last note: this set does include a super-jumper and it IS possible to remove the minifig without damaging them. There aren&rsquo;t any specific super-jumper functions in this set though, so if you really don&rsquo;t want to use it, you&rsquo;re not missing out.</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-15T01:16:25.503Z","Ultimate Carnage","<p>For this review, it&#39;s&nbsp;76036-1:&nbsp;Carnage&#39;s SHIELD Sky Attack. Does&nbsp;this little package have a big bang for the buck? Absolutely!</p>

<p>Minfigures: This is always the primary reason to buy a Marvel set. The is mostly successful, though not entirely. Three figures come in this set, Spider-Man (Miles Morales), Carnage, and an unnamed SHIELD Agent.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spider-Man is the most ubiquitous Marvel hero, and this is the incarnation from the former Ultimate universe. Miles assumes the role of Spider-Man after his reality&#39;s Peter Parker dies after a battle with the Green Goblin. This was mostly adapted for the recent &quot;Into the Spider-Verse&quot; animated film. (Side note, go see that movie if you haven&#39;t. It&#39;s fantastic and I didn&#39;t care for the concept before seeing it). Miles has a variant suit, black with red webbing lines. Unfortunately, this version has plain black legs. Sigh. This session of the&nbsp;character is only found in this set and a recently released set that also lacks leg printing. This is infuriating that LEGO would cheap out on this detail as it does detract from an otherwise solid figure.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cletus&nbsp;Kassidy&nbsp;became the murderous supervillain Carnage after bonding with an offspring of the Venom symbiote&nbsp;that was left behind when its parent broke Kassidy&#39;s&nbsp;cell mate, Eddie Brock,&nbsp;out of jail. Famous for the 90s&nbsp;&quot;Maximum Carnage&quot; storyline, Carnage is a bit of a one-note psychopath. However, his minifigure is anything but simple. Intricately printed on the torso, arms, and legs, he looks perfect. There is a neck bracket and brace to attach the symbiotes&nbsp;dangerous tendrils, that unfortunately covers the back printing on the torso. It can be tricky to position Carnage upright because the soft tendrils spin in the bracket. You need to turn the bottom two upwards to solve the problem. Even with that annoyance, Carnage is exactly what I&#39;d hope LEGO would do for their unique figures when they sell them.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unnamed agent is the last figure. He has a printed SHIELD uniform torso, plain blue legs, a black flight helmet, and head with a confident and scared faces. There&#39;s&nbsp; not much else to this figure.&nbsp;If there was a printed head with an eyepatch, this body would be perfect for an original version&nbsp;Nick Fury, which is ironic because the ultimate universe version is the Samuel L Jackson inspired variant that&#39;s popular now because of the MCU using the actual source in the role.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The build is a small SHIELD&nbsp;hovercraft that Carnage is apparently attacking. It&#39;s actually pretty clever and quick to put together, and the only stickers are a SHIELD insignia and HUD. The two fan pieces are actually printed, which is a nice surprise for such a small and inexpensive set. I will part it out, but it was not a bad build. It also comes with a Super Jumper piece, but I never use them because of their tendency to crack legs on figures when using them. Thankfully LEGO has stopped making them.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value: The RRP was 12.99 which was not a bad one for two unique figures, a third figure and a small build. I grabbed two when they were on sale for 9.99 so it was an even better deal.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luckliy an updated version of the two major characters was released recently, so if you missed this one, the figures are available again. Otherwise if you can get this set&nbsp;for a decent price, grab it.&nbsp;</p>
