<p><strong>Awesomeness:&nbsp; </strong>Spiderman still remains to be one of the the most popular superheroes of all time, and&nbsp;I think a part of that is due to his unique array of&nbsp;bad guys, but more on that later.&nbsp; The set itself really isn&#39;t too impressive of a build.&nbsp; Lots of little brown pieces and others that are supposed to just break off easily.&nbsp; The sandman hands are pretty cool and I really like the build of a crane.&nbsp; For some reason superheroes and cranes go so well together.&nbsp; The set definitely has the approval of my 5 year old.&nbsp; He plays with it constantly and loves using the jumper to make spiderman go flying into stuff.&nbsp; We paired this set nicely with the Bridge Battle set to kind of make a little city scene.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs:</strong>&nbsp; Here is where it gets good.&nbsp; This spiderman does have red printing on his boots, which makes him slightly different from the spiderman that is in like every other set.&nbsp; So I guess that is cool.&nbsp; Iron Spider (who was originally Peter Parker in the fancy suit Iron Man made for him, but if you read comics this Iron Spider might actually be a different person) looks great.&nbsp; Simple print of the torso and that is it.&nbsp; His golden spider legs attached to his back but do not move around that much.&nbsp; They maybe should have been more like Doc Ock&#39;s arms/legs or whatever.&nbsp; Sandman looks great.&nbsp; Nice printing on him to make him look sandy and I love the little build for his hammer.&nbsp; This version of Rhino is more in line with the movie, with it being a bald guy in a Mech suit.&nbsp; This Rhino mech suit is a simple build and is ok for a side build.&nbsp; Nothing like the Hulkbuster.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Well....</strong> I am being a little generous, but it is a good set.&nbsp; Good minifigs with lots of play features.&nbsp; Although, I really don&#39;t favor this set for myself as an adult (unless you are a giant spiderman fan) but I think it is very kid friendly and lots of fun.</p>

"Max_Bricks","2017-09-02T22:21:41.633Z","Needs a Better Structure!","<p>I have mixed feelings when it comes to this set. I received this set 8/18/16. I didn&#39;t build this set until sometime in March of 2017 because I never found the time to build. Once I built I learned a lot of things about this set.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Great mini-figures&nbsp;like&nbsp;Sandman, Rhino, Iron Spider&nbsp;and even Spider-Man with the duel molded legs.</p>

<p>There is a lot of cool features that you can&nbsp;do like the mobile crane ,which you can move around and even drop it. Also you can put the mini-figures in the brick built sandman arms and there&#39;s trap features too.</p>

<p>I also love the mech for Rhino because you can pose it and it just looks exactly like the one from the Amazing Spider-Man movie.&nbsp;So your probably wondering why I put 3 stars well here it is.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The structure stinks really bad. Once I built the set i decided to move it to somewhere else on my deck and let&#39;s just say the whole structure came apart right after I spent the time building it! So I thought that it was just gonna break that one time. The I installed a new shelf in my room where I displayed all of my Lego Marvel Superheroes sets and when I was trying to put this set up the structure once again fell apart and the pieces&nbsp;scattered&nbsp;across the room! I feel personally the set should either include a base plate or just rebuild the bottom of the set so when you move it won&#39;t break on you.&nbsp;So if you thought that was it your wrong.</p>

<p>Also on the box it says Ultimate Spider-Man,which is the Tv series that aired on Disney XD. How ever I have done some research and watched the episodes with Rhino and Rhino is not a mech in the show! This really irritates&nbsp;me because I&#39;ve&nbsp;been a Marvel fan for 9 years and just bothers when the Lego sets are not accurate to the shows or even movies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So in conclusion this set has a pretty bad structure and is inaccurate to the show, but the mini-figures and the playable features save the set from getting&nbsp;a zero out of five stars. I would by this set if your a collector of the Lego Marvel Superheroes line or if you want the mini-figures included, but don&#39;t rely on the set to hold together.</p>
