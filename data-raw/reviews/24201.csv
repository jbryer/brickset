<span style=""color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Firstly I&rsquo;d like to mention the biggest controversy with this set. It had been delayed for about two weeks here in the UK due to a production problem. The friction between the Technic pieces and the legs of the ant model were very loose. The updated sets have extra &lsquo;2M Cross Axle W. Groove&rsquo; and &lsquo;Nose Cone Small 1X1&rsquo; for each leg to make them more stable and it&rsquo;s a successful change. I did try and use it without those two addition pieces (how it was originally produced) and they were not strong enough to hold the model with a little pressure on it, it would just want to get squashed. Nothing else was changed besides the instructions; the boxes are the same, without any changes, It&rsquo;s hardly noticeable. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is the same case for the U.S. as they have been available there since the June 1st release date. I&rsquo;m not sure it they would go up in value or not.</span><br style=""color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" />

I hope that this trend continues in the future. So next year we would have an entire wave based on &lsquo;Captain America: Civil War&rsquo; and at least one set based on &lsquo;Doctor Strange&rsquo; around the same price as this set. It is a shame that LEGO never produced more sets based on the &lsquo;Ant-Man&rsquo; movie, it has much more potential but I guess it could have got overloaded like the &lsquo;Avengers: Age Of Ultron&rsquo; sets.</span><br style=""color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" />

The artwork showing the set is great as Ant-Man comes to the rescue to stop Yellow Jacket throwing screws and LEGO bricks across the floor or table. I would just like to point out that if this is indeed the final battle in a kid&rsquo;s bedroom as the trailer suggests, then why on earth are there loose screws? Sometimes designers could have poetic licence so that may be the reason why. The bottom right has the movie logo as well as showing you the Minifigures included in the set. The new addition of the super jumper graphic makes it seem like only two Minifigures are included and they are showing you the ant-man Minifigure again as an example since the Ant-Man and Hank Pym figures are very similar in design.</span><br style=""color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" />

The main problem I have is the helmet, in the movie it&rsquo;s completely covered hoover in this set it looks like they when between the comics and the movie with the mouth opening. I personally think it could have been how early LEGO designs these sets. Not many people know that the studios send them early concept art which is why some scenes that sets depict which don&rsquo;t appear in the final cut of the movies because changes were made in the production of the movie. These toy and product designs are done way before the movie is even filmed. Another problem with this set is the reuse of existing Minifigure heads in this case its Ezra Bridger&rsquo;s head from Star Wars: Rebels.</span><br style=""color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" />

Its problem lies with the dark silver colour chosen, in the movie its black. This time LEGO has decided to reuse typical bad guy head which has also been used in many other sets, it suits him so I cannot complain. His mechanical harness is my biggest problem, it&rsquo;s great for kids with the ability to move them and to shoot the studs, for collectors and perfectionist like me I would have recommended that they should have used &lsquo;Leg W &Oslash;3.2 Shaft 1/2 M&rsquo; in Black with yellow printing on it. I&rsquo;m currently trying to figure out the design of my own. The harness itself is really bulky and it&rsquo;s annoying that they used a tan piece which does not fit will with the contemporary design of the figure.</span><br style=""color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" />

This Minifigure is the most basic of the three with minimal printing since he was the original Ant-Man before hiring Scott Lang. He uses the Gandalf&rsquo;s head which was also reused in the new Jurassic World sets. Hank Pym also comes with an extra black head piece to presumably cover his entire face since the helmet didn&rsquo;t? I believe he might have flashbacks in the movie of him as Ant-Man. This could also be a figure that never shows up in the movie as it could have just been a scraped idea during early production. I don&rsquo;t believe an old Hank Pym could shrink anymore which is why he retired; we have to wait until we see the movie in about a month!&nbsp;</span><br style=""color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" />

This set contains 2 numbered bags (1-2) you also get the pair of wings loose in the box. Thankfully mine were not creased. This set has one instruction manual, a comic adventure which features all three sets from the Summer 2015 Marvel wave.

When pictures first surfaced of the set these quickly caught my attention. The LEGO bricks really set a scale for the Minifigures in context but you can also use them as regular Minifigures. Now it makes me wonder if the LEGO bricks will be in the movie, or if it&#39;s just a nod to the LEGO brand! The trailer does feature some simple blocks and other toys but I guess this made the most sense for a LEGO product to have &lsquo;giant&rsquo; LEGO bricks.</span><br />

One problem I did come across is that that the ball joint areas are besides the seating area for Ant-Man so the legs slightly rub against them when placing him in and it also limits you from moving the figure forward or backwards. It&rsquo;s an easy adjustment though, you can use a &lsquo;Cross Axle 7M&rsquo; and place a &lsquo;1/2 Bush&rsquo; at either side before you place the &lsquo;Ball Cup 3M &Oslash;10.2.&rsquo; The wing pieces themselves are really cool and realistic since they have the small textures. I also dislike how the Technic beams are exposed on the wing joints; you could easily fix that by replacing the two &lsquo;Crossaxle 3M With Knob&rsquo; with two &lsquo;Cross Axle 3M if you are going to keep the wings tightly attached. I guess with the why LEGO have designed it gives you an option on how tight you want the wings attached.</span></p>

You can also see some small amount of pink pieces which are not just there for fun, do believe they are added as realistic details. The actual build was pretty decent for its price. The model is very sturdy and nothing has fallen apart after swooshing it around for a couple of hours.&nbsp;</span></p>

Since this is a singular set from a specific movie the production value of the pair of wings and the two new helmets greatly affected how much the designer could put into the set. I&rsquo;m not complaining about the size of the ant, it&rsquo;s a perfect size and I wouldn&rsquo;t change the size or the model, even those minor quibbles because I won&rsquo;t be playing with it. I just feel it&rsquo;s slightly small for the price.</span><br style=""color: rgb(40, 40, 40); font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22.3999996185303px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"" />

For &pound;19.99 you cannot go wrong; it&rsquo;s a great impulse buy from a movie and you don&rsquo;t need to get tons of sets to get all the characters. The Minifigures, model&rsquo;s and playability is all there. This is defiantly one of the best set around this price that LEGO has released in a few years. Good job designer. It appeals to me more than the current larger models on the market for sure. I got it for the Minifigures; boy was is a surprise and a successful set overall!</span></p>

"ModularRoger","2015-07-25T04:01:51.517Z","Like The Film, Refreshingly Different","<p>There is little to add to Adzbadboy&#39;s&nbsp;in-depth review and great photographs, but I thought that I would take a brief spin through a few of my thoughts on this set. Like the film that it ties-in to, 76039 is an out-of-the-ordinary set, and that&#39;s a good thing.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art is very attractive, with primary colors that really pop and a wood-grain tabletop in the background that suggests scale--which is really funny when you think about it, because LEGO sets are always that size, but usually illustrated in some theme-specific fantasy setting--and gives a warmth to the image.</p>

<p>The instructions are excellent, and the included comic book doubles between Ant-Man on one side, and the two concurrent Spider-Man sets (76036 Carnage &amp; 76037 Rhino/Sandman) on the flipside.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice selection of small pieces, with some interesting Technic elements to attach the ant&#39;s legs. As a lot, it looks underwhelming in the bags but it all comes together quite well. I especially love the colors in this set. The buildable scaled-to-shrunken-minifig LEGO blocks are disarmingly bright and nostalgic, while the darker blues and reds of the ant look great, especially with a touch of dark pink here and there. The wings seem durable.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>First of all, the helmets look terrific. The dual-molded technic is utilized quite well here, translucent colors peering through shades of grey or black. Ant-Man (Scott Lang) and Yellowjacket have nicely detailed printing. Scott looks absolutely fantastic. As others have noted, Yellowjacket&#39;s&nbsp;heavy&nbsp;&#39;back bracket&#39; puts the minifig off-balance when free-standing. He will fall backwards.&nbsp;I think that it could have been constructed in a lighter-weight way, but it it is at least constructed solidly. Good use of the stud-shooters.</p>

<p>Hank Pym is the odd figure out here. Frankly, this figure would have made a lot more sense as a polybag&nbsp;or exclusive, since he&nbsp;does not&nbsp;fit the scene from the film and is rather redundant (yet simpler in design) of Scott Lang. In fairness, it would be hard to pick a replacement, considering the context. A police officer, perhaps, but unique trumps generic.&nbsp;A certain other character, whose name I will not mention, would have been fantastic, but for the purposes of spoilers was understandably ineligible. As it stands, this set includes the two figures who obviously make sense from a playability standpoint, as well as a bonus &#39;collectible&#39;&nbsp;third figure.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>There is not a lot to the build here, but it is a fun one nonetheless. The idea of building literal LEGO bricks like this is an inspired one. The possibilities inherent in the concept cause me to get excited, imagining a whole theme based on&nbsp;Ant-Man. It will probably never happen, but there is potential for some great design and playability there. Regarding the ant itself, it is refreshing, the extent to which it is built. This is not a molded bigfig-type of creature, but a genuine construction&nbsp;project.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>It looks all looks great, and in this case, small is hardly a liability. The playability factor is good, with the ant being reasonably articulate-able and the brick-catapult mechanism is simple and fun. This set is a case of quality over quantity, simplicity over complexity.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The finished product bears more resemblance to a standard toy&nbsp;than most LEGO sets do, but its deceptively enjoyable--if brief--build earns points from me. The whole thing, including the minifigs, is very attractive to look at, and very playable. It has a personality about it that offers a nice alternative to the typical superhero set, which is really the same thing that <em>Ant-Man</em> the film offers relative to, say, <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>. Not the greatest value or obvious bang-for-the-buck. But this set is easy to recommend, nonetheless.</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2015-09-14T16:38:38.697Z","Great Set All Round","<p>I wasn&#39;t sure about this set when I first saw it, and the production delay due to errors just increased my doubts, but when I finally saw the movie, I decided to buy the set and I&#39;m glad I did.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Both the box and the instructions are standard for what you&#39;d expect for a Lego set of this size.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the box does not have the corrected piece count, so don&#39;t worry if yours has the smaller number.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The outright stars of the show parts-wise are the huge wings and the new moulded&nbsp;suits for the minifigures. You get two colours of the brand new Ant-Man suits and an equally cool Yellowjacket suit. The huge mechanical wings for the ant are also printed and are very cool.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minfigures are arguably the main draw of this set and the do not disappoint. Ant-Man/Scott Lang looks great with his new moulded helmet and suit, but I do question the movie accuracy of the helmet, as in the movie he did not have a gap for his mouth. Hank Pym is in a recoloured&nbsp;suit, and again I question the movie accuracy, as Pym never actually suited up in the film, except in flashbacks, and also had glasses and facial hair. Yellowjacket is the most movie-accurate, with a great helmet and suit, and the cool guns on his back. Overall these are three very strong minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is great, the first bag consisting of the giant Lego bricks which I personally think is a great idea. They are fairly simple, but definitely add something to the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second bag deals with the giant ant, who certainly resembles Anthony, but, SPOILER ALERT, Anthony had actually been killed by this point. Nonetheless, the ant is great and the huge wings look great.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great all together and the giant Lego bricks so you can do things at ant scale are a great idea, but if I had one complaint it would be that we are lacking microfigs&nbsp;so that we can have Ant-Man shrunk down and be to scale with regular figs. The best substitute I have found is the red action figure from the Big Bang Theory set. This a minor issue though, and the set is absolutely fantastic.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this set, and I hope it becomes a regular thing for Lego to make a small set featuring all the main characters from any MCU film they don&#39;t do a whole wave for. This a great set for any fan and has great playability and detail.</p>

"thechabear","2015-09-18T18:40:53.697Z","an antastic set :D","<p>Hello everyone and welcome to another review. Today i&#39;m reviewing the ant man&#39;s final battle set which had some delays in the release but I got it soon after. I looked every where for this set and they were all gone and I finally found it in milpidas. But i have it, i build it, i have seen the movie, and now lets review</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box has ant man on it and the instructions are same but they promote the new marvel sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>some parts that stand out to me are:</p>

<p>the 2 ants</p>

<p>the minifig parts</p>

<p>the ant&#39;s wings</p>

<p>and the navy blue parts</p>

<h3>Minifigures-3</h3>

<p>ANT MAN- The star of the movie, Scott Lang aka ant man is my favorite figure in this set. He has a helmet that looked really hard to sculpt and it is only shared with Hank Pym. He has some nice printing on the torso and the legs. He has some back printing and he has the Ezra Brigger face.</p>

<p><img src=""http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/lego/images/e/e1/LEGOantman.png/revision/latest?cb=20150522192009"" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>HANK PYM: Hank Pym was the original ant mn and he is in his flash back suit. Idk why the put him in this set but it&#39;s a good addition. He has darker and redder&nbsp;printing of Scott&#39;s suit and he has a darker helmet. He has the Gandalf face and you can switch&nbsp;it for a plain black head. I now note all figures are exclusive to date.</p>

<p><img src=""http://download.gamezone.com/uploads/image/data/1182875/Hank_Pym_Ant-Man_LEGO.JPG"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>YELLOW JACKET: Yellow&nbsp;jacket is main villain in the ant man film. He might be bad but he is just as good as a minfig as Hank and Scott. The has a unique printing on his torso which is grey and yellow. He has plain grey legs. He has a unique helmet and he has the bruce wayne\loki face. He has stud blaster clipped onto a backpack on his back. He also has the wings clipped onto his back too</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The building experience:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This was one of the sets I really enjoyed building. I took me 20 minutes to finish the building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like this set. We have 2 parts to the set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>ANTHONY THE FLYING ANT: Anthony is ant man&#39;s favorite and only flying ant. He is the main build and one of my favorite builds in the marvel theme. He has the spider leg parts for his legs from the chima line. He also has part on his back where ant man can sit on. He has his wings and head on ball joints and his teeth in front can move sideways on hinges. His back parts can be moved up and down on the hinged piece.</p>

<p><img src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tNUwGRMFdz4/VeO_JenFHzI/AAAAAAAAEG8/VE-UuRBYOTE/s400/LegoAntMan6Anthony.JPG"" /></p>

<p>LEGO SCREW LAUNCHER: This is a pretty cool addition to the set. As you can see it looks like ant man has shrunken down. We have a gigantic 1x2 yellow and a 1x1 red. We do get normal versions of these bricks which is excellent for stop motions. We get some screws with stickers on top and we can launch it from hitting the yellow 1x2. The lego icons are stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>EXTRA: We get a lot of extra pieces. We get 2 ants, some yellow studs, the 2 bricks, and a super jumper</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is one of the better marvel sets this year as all of the charters are exclusive, we get a good build, and it&#39;s a very good set. Retail price is $20.00 which is awesome. This i suspect will go up in value so might as well stock up on these. I Hope you enjoyed this review and i will see u all later.</p>

"thebrickgeek","2015-09-08T19:29:45.753Z","What can I say simply Ant-tastic!","<p>So the new film to marvels cinematic universe ant-man is awesome!!! Lego has made a set on the film but does it hold up to the film well lets find out!!</p>

<p>Warning may contain Spoilers to ant-man&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the normal size for a set at &pound;20 and features the box features the set in action. While the instructions are good and easy to follow but little kids might have some trouble with building it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get some dark blue and dark red pieces while interestingly you get some bright pink colors. You also get two ant wings as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get three minifigures in this set which is great for the price and don&#39;t dive in to any spoilers which is also good but there is a flaw that all three of the minifigs carry but I&#39;ll get into that later</p>

<h3><strong>Ant-man</strong></h3>

<p>At last we finally get a ant-man minifigure in a lego set and this is Scott lang version of ant-man, of course this is based off the film and not the comics,this is a near accurate ant-man from the film, the problems are that the helmet mouth area is open which shows it&#39;s mouth this might be for the kids but I find it really annoying,the helmet is great though with a great trans-red on it showing the eyes.The other flaw with this guy is that he has Ezra Bridger face from the star wars rebels theme, while this don&#39;t annoy me much it could annoy a lot of people though and the problem is with the other two minifigs. How ever the torso and leg printing is excellent and the suit is red and grey is&nbsp; like in the film. So overall two flaw hold this minifigure back but it is a near perfect ant man from the film</p>

<h3><strong>Hank pym</strong></h3>

<p>However Scott is not the only ant-man in this set. Hank pym is a important character in the film however doing some checking on marvel mcu wiki I don&#39;t think that the suit is based on the film. His ant-man suit is black and red. He also shares the main problem that Scott has. He has the open mouth and he uses Gandalf head from the lord of the rings theme. He also comes with a black head which I&#39;m not to sure why but lets use are imagination to solve that. While hank&#39;s suit doesn&#39;t appear in the film, the suit looks awesome and is great to have a another main character</p>

<h3><strong>Yellow jacket</strong></h3>

<p>Yellow jacket a.k.a Darren Cross is a awesome actually epic minifigure in my opinion this is the best mini figure in the set, It looks just like yellow jacket in the film,the printing is great on this guy. He has a massive backpack on his back which does weigh this guy down and make him fall over a lot, he comes with two stud shooters for playability which represents the two laser guns he has in the film. He shares the same problem with the rest of the two guys as I mention he uses the same used head. Yellow jacket uses Bruce Wayne head from the dc superheroes theme. His helmet is awesome and is a new mold. So It&#39;s great to have the main bad guy from ant-man in a lego set</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very simple and took me around ten minutes. The flying ant is impressive with moveable mouth that can go in all directions thanks to ball joints. The legs how ever only rotate around and don&#39;t move at all which might be a pain for stop motions and for play.The back tail thing of the ant moves up and down using hinges and the wings move all around thanks to ball joints. You can place ant-man on the ant. despite the leg problem I am impressed how good the flying ant is and mostly the sets strongest point. Also included is a lego catapult, in the film ant-man and yellow jacket have a fight in a kids room and so this shows when they shrink down. The catapult is great it has a&nbsp; red 1x1 brick and a 1x2 brick in a big size. There is a sticker with the lego logo on top of it unfortunately. The catapult shoots out screws however it does not shoot far.I think collectors will like the big bricks and I hope lego does something does this in the future. Finally we have the dreaded super-jumper,I like many people don&#39;t like using these as the crack the back of the minifigs legs however kids might not care about these and will use these a lot. You also get two ants molded in blue and you get the normal size 1x2 and the 1x1.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I was impressed by how good the flying ant came out despite the legs and the catapult&nbsp; is brilliant</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set in a number of reason despite the flaws it has.The three minifigs are great and are mostly accurate to the films. This is a great starter set for kids to start there superheroes adventures. Should you get this set? Absolutely the price point is really worth it and the best set of 2015 summer sets.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Fun build</p>

<p>great flying ant and catapult</p>

<p>price is worth it</p>

<p>Ant-man finally in a set</p>

<p>Con:</p>

<p>all three minifigures has flaws</p>

<p>the ant legs don&#39;t move</p>

<p>Overall this is a great set to get at a great cheap price and the best set out of the summer wave</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my review and I hope you enjoyed it. See you guys soon!</p>

"Professor_X","2015-11-17T21:58:45.267Z","""Is it too late to change the name?""","<p>Like many I was surprised to hear that Marvel was gambling with a such an unknown and often silly-sounding&nbsp;super hero, but was pleasantly surprised&nbsp;to see marvel pull off such a great character in Scott Lang. I was very excited to get my hands on this set the minute I heard it would be released, and I was a able to get it within a couple days of its availibility. Is this set a pleasant surprise like the movie, or is more like what many expected the movie to be. Read on to see for yourself...</p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>The build is made up of 3 parts; The minifigures , Some over sized LEGO bricks, and one of the many flying ants Ant-man interacts with. The&nbsp;set also includes a super-jumper, two ants from the Indiana Jones theme recast in dark blue, normal sized bricks(the same kinds as the giant ones represent), and a couple of brick-built screws which are part of a play feature with the bricks. While the build was quick and easy, building things as unusual as&nbsp;giant LEGO and an ant made this build both memorable and interesting.</p>

<h3>The Minifigures:</h3>

<h4>Yellowjacket:</h4>

<p>In many ways Yellowjacket is both an amazing figure as well as an unfortunate disappointment. the printing on Darren Cross&#39; suit&nbsp;is very accurate, with lots of silver and yellow highlights across its predominately gunmetal grey color scheme. His helmet is a standout piece, with a trans-yellow visor molded into helmet&#39;s frame, quite a contrast to his rather plain, simple headpiece which has been used on various minifigures since 2012. Yellowjacket&#39;s&nbsp;backpack, though, leaves a lot to be desired. It is extremely bulky, so much so that he can&#39;t stand up straight. While I think the idea of incorporating twin stud-shooters into the backpack is a good one, it really looks nothing like the stinger-like guns Yellowjacket has in the movie.</p>

<h4>Hank Pym:</h4>

<p>Hank pym is the strangest minifigure in this set, because I&nbsp;have absolutely no idea what he&#39;s based on. Hank Pym never suited up in a separate suit in the movie, but I personally really like this minifigure. His simple red and black color scheme makes him standout, and its great to get the Ant-Man helmet in an alternate color. Hank Pym comes with two head pieces, one reused from the more recent Gandalf Minifigures, and the other plain black. I&#39;m really frustrated that LEGO didn&#39;t buckle down and make a head piece based on Michael Douglas, but I guess it doesn&#39;t make much of a difference with the helmet on.</p>

<h4>Ant-Man:</h4>

<p>Scott Lang had a very detailed suit in the movie, and this minifigure matches that perfectly. Dark red and slight grey highlights are all over the suit, and I&#39;m especially glad that LEGO was able to effectively produce some of the smaller yet key components like the regulator. The silver and trans-red&nbsp;helmet piece is almost perfect; except for the fact that the mouth isn&#39;t covered. This really draws away from the rest of the helmet&#39;s excellence, and I hope that it will be rectified in one of the upcoming&nbsp;Captain America: Civil War&nbsp;sets. Like the rest of the minifigures, Ant-man reuses a head piece, this time from Star Wars: Rebel&#39;s Ezra Bridger. Again, this really gets on my nerves, but I&#39;m sure Paul Rudd will get his face properly cast in minifigure form soon enough.</p>

<h3>The Completed Set:</h3>

<h4>Giant LEGO Bricks:</h4>

<p>An interesting set piece I&#39;m surprised we haven&#39;t seen before(at least to my knowledge), These Bricks are representing giant versions of a bright red 1x1 brick, and a bright yellow 1x2 plate which are mounted on a white base. While they use stickers to represent the word &quot;LEGO&quot; molded into the studs on actual bricks, I think it really adds a crucial detail. A white hoop piece is attached to the yellow 1x2, which is used for catapulting the giant screw pieces(which also use stickers)&nbsp;that are included. While this is unusual, I think it works well as very creative and effective play feature.</p>

<h4>Ant:</h4>

<p>Representative of one of the many ants Scott is seen with in the movie, This ant is not only very well designed but is also a great parts pack, from the new soft plastic wing pieces to all the dark red/blue parts that are used. The ant is highly posable as well; Its wings can swivel 360, its legs are all adjustable, its abdomen moves up and down, and of course the ant&#39;s head is mounted on one of the tiny Mixel&nbsp;ball joint pieces. its ability to move so much&nbsp;just adds to its detail and&nbsp;great play value, I mean, who doesn&#39;t want to pop Ant-Man on a giant ant and fly him around the room?&nbsp; My only complaint would be about the leg pieces&nbsp;which, even&nbsp;though look great.&nbsp;can be pretty unstable(though I bought my copy before the recall).</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>

<p>This set ,&nbsp;though one of the strangest I&#39;ve purchased, has become one of my favourite sets of the year. At 24.99 CA/ 19.99 US, I think the price point is reasonable for something so unique. Now that the race to get this set has ended, if you can find one I would definetly recomend picking it up. While it isn&#39;t perfect, I look at it this way&nbsp;Three exclusive minifigures, rare and unique parts, and two strange yet satisfying builds. I mean,&nbsp;what more could you want?</p>

This review has some really cool special effects including Dawson himself getting to go for a ride on Ant-Thony!</p>

<p>Overall Dawson felt this set had good playability, while being a very simple set, but he loved the detail of Ant-Thony&nbsp;and how the wings were incorporated into the build.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
