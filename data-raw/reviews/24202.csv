<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box of set 21119 is a decent size for what you get inside. &nbsp;the contents of The Dungeon&nbsp;are 3 numbered&nbsp;bags,&nbsp;2&nbsp;8x8 plates and an instruction&nbsp;book. &nbsp;The instruction book is medium&nbsp;sized and is easy to follow. &nbsp;When you are finished with the build they have one alternate build, some ads for sets lego.com etc.,&nbsp;and an ad to parents about&nbsp;Minecraft.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is nothing that special in this set, other than the following:&nbsp;4 of number 6089147, technically 2 of 6093263,&nbsp;2 of 6093244 and an iron&nbsp;pickaxe.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Again nothing Lego&nbsp;Minecraft collectors won&#39;t have already (just one unprepared&nbsp;Steve and two zombies)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty straight&nbsp;forward as we have come to expect from these sets with bag one containing the small parts eg torches,&nbsp;ore. &nbsp;Bag two completes the model. &nbsp;The alternate build although not that good looking&nbsp;is practical - you build some stairs for Steve to get down to the dungeon from the surface. &nbsp;It took me approximately&nbsp;20-25 minutes to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is&nbsp;great! - it looks really good and Minecrafty, the features are&nbsp;the&nbsp;turning &nbsp;micro-zombie in the spawner and the ability&nbsp;to &quot;spawn&quot; in zombies&nbsp;and they&nbsp;work really well and are nicely hidden. &nbsp;Plus on top of all of that you can connect it up to the other Minecraft sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>THIS SET IS AWESOME! &nbsp;If you like Minecraft&nbsp;and Lego or if you like the Minecraft sets then you MUST have this set! &nbsp;Plus it is good value even though it is a licensed set.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;hope this review helped you choose your next&nbsp;Lego set.</p>

"Rainbowice","2016-05-13T13:50:56.473Z","Great Playability","<p>I really enjoy this set! I think that you get quite a bit for you money, (&pound;19.99 / $19.99 / 19.99&euro;) maybe just a smidgen over priced.</p>

<p>This set includes: 3 mini-figures&nbsp;(Steve and two zombies)</p>

<p>219 pieces</p>

<p>1 iron pickaxe accessory</p>

<p>2 wheat accessories</p>

<p>1 redstone&nbsp;(I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to be)</p>

<p>I enjoyed building most of this and it was reasonably easy apart from the mob spawner spin function, though that is one of my favorite parts of the set.</p>

<p>The playability of this set is really good! First of all if you put one of the zombies on a section of the floor and pull a little bit of the rock that juts of of the wall, it will give the impression of a new zombie spawning into the dungeon. Secondly there is a little round brick concealed within the rock, if you give it a spin, there is a little zombie in the spawner that will spin around. This is a reference to the mob spawner animation in the game.</p>

<p>There is also a little chest in the corner of the dungeon which contains 2 pieces of wheat and a couple of trans-red dot elements, which I guess, is supposed to be a piece of redstone.</p>

<p>The layout of this&nbsp;set&nbsp;is really good. The are only two walls which is really great for&nbsp;playability. The set really looks like the actual dungeon in the game with the mossy cobblestone and iron ore. The only thing which isn&#39;t very accurate is the patch of lava with a cactus in the middle, though I&#39;m not really complaining as it looks quite cool.</p>

<p>Overall really positive comments on this set! I would recommend this to&nbsp;people&nbsp;5 and above.&nbsp;</p>

"Schmoobin","2017-06-03T02:16:08.887Z","So Many Functions!","<p>I am a huge fan of Minecraft, but when Lego started producing Minecraft sets, I was a bit skeptical at first. &nbsp;Now, I have obtained The Dungeon, I have been starting to like the theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a standard Lego Minecraft box, and is the perfect size for a small set like this. &nbsp;As always, the&nbsp;front displays the model itself, with Steve being chased by zombies in the dungeon, with a cobblestone background. &nbsp;The back of the box illustrates all the functions that come with this nifty set. &nbsp;I&#39;ll get to those later</p>

<p>Now once we have opened the box, you get the instructions. &nbsp;It&#39;s a standard instruction box, albeit&nbsp;it is large for such a small set, packed with 49 pages and advertisements on the back pages for other Minecraft sets and the Lego website. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Honestly, there aren&#39;t any unique parts to the set other than minifigure pieces and pieces 6093263 and 6093244, parts to the small zombie for the spawner</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures include two zombie figures and a Steve figure. &nbsp;Steve is armed with only a pickaxe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There is nothing too special or unique about this build except for a couple of functions. &nbsp;Bag one contains all of the small builds. &nbsp;These include the minifigures, cactus, spawner, blocks and a small sand area. &nbsp;The spawner was the most interesting build. &nbsp;When you build it, you place a small gear right below it.</p>

<p>Bag two contains the main build, the dungeon. &nbsp;After we build the dungeon itself, we place the small builds within it. &nbsp;The most interesting thing about this a small area that spins. &nbsp;At the end of that area is a gear, which attaches to the gear on the spawner. &nbsp;Once you place the spawner, you will be able to spin it while rolling your finger across a cylindrical piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks good. &nbsp;It&#39;s pretty accurate to the source material. &nbsp;I like how it&#39;s clearly right below a few blocks of sandstone when in the game, dungeons tend to be spawned much lower, but it looks good as a design. &nbsp;I&#39;m just wondering why there would be a cactus spawning underground. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Functions: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Small trap door on the side of the model that might either represent a manmade trap or a creeper explosion.</li>
	<li>By rolling your finger on the cylindrical piece in the ground, you can make the small zombie spin in the spawner.</li>
	<li>Accessing the chest, full of wheat and redstone</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I like this set. &nbsp;It&#39;s a good model, and while it might not be the best for display, this model is packed with playability. &nbsp;If you&#39;re a Minecraft fan and you have a small budget, I definitely recommend this set!</p>
