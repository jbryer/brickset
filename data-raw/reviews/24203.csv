<p>I bought this set from a fellow AFOL at a good discount, mostly for the white parts. &nbsp;Or so I justified the small cash outlay.</p>

<p>Up until now I&#39;ve seen no point in Minecraft sets - other than a source of 2x2 / 2x4 bricks, or parts in a particular colour. &nbsp;The builds at first glance look overly simplistic and good only for young children, and overpriced at that.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the build experience with this set. &nbsp;Sure, it&#39;s no AFOL-orientated expensive Creator set. &nbsp;But neither is it simply a stack of 2x2 bricks.</p>

<p>There is some good detailing and not-so-simple building techniques that an AFOL&nbsp;could easily overlook. &nbsp;A building with hinged side&nbsp;for interior access&nbsp;is simple, but add on a roof that comes off easily, and you realise this technique is no different to that found on any large modular. &nbsp;The tree contains simple SNOT techniques - but I know some of us&nbsp;AFOLs still struggle to include this technique where we could. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t have thought to use trans-green in a tree, but it works. &nbsp;And the door...</p>

<p>The brick-built door not only captures the Minecraft look rather well, but is an object lesson in not needing all those specialised bits and pieces. &nbsp;You don&#39;t need a door to make a door in the Lego world - or in Minecraft. &nbsp;It&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever seen those reddish-brown flowers used this way!</p>

<p>There is an &#39;alternative&#39; build at the end of the instructions. &nbsp;It didn&#39;t appeal to me, but I appreciate the attempt to remind both KFOLs, TFOLs and AFOLs that a set *can* be remade in different ways.</p>

<p>As for playability, I&#39;m not the target audience. &nbsp;I can say that my husband, and both teenage daughters, took delight in discovering the ice-breaking play feature and generally &#39;fiddling&#39; with the set once built.</p>

<p>As for parts, I am not disappointed. &nbsp;Looking back over the last five years, how many low-to-mid-priced sets contain any quantity of white? Barely any. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Take the 8x8 plate - hard to come by at this price, and the set has 3 other plates 4-stud wide or more. &nbsp;Add in 21 of the 2x2 bricks and 15 2x4&#39;s (plus others in other colours)... and I would think anyone going for a Winter Village or Hoth-based scene would be all over this set, if they can get it for a good price. &nbsp;As we all know, used white bricks can be a disappointment.</p>

<p>Look carefully and you&#39;ll see very few pieces so Minecraft-specific that they can&#39;t be used in your MOCs. &nbsp;With some creativity, even the base of the Creeper could be used in landscaping creations. &nbsp;A light bluish-grey bucket comes in less than a dozen sets, most of them Minecraft. &nbsp;And those pieces currently unique to this set, are excellent for MOCs - 1x1 printed buttons tile, 1x2 printed buttons brick - great for a&nbsp;snowman, or maybe elevator buttons, or...?&nbsp;The printing on mine was sharp, and an extra 1x1 printed tile came as a bonus. &nbsp;Check out the 8 2x2 trans-medium blue bricks also for your icy lake or village well.</p>

<p>My set came with 14 &#39;extra&#39; pieces, including an extra flower stalk.</p>

<p>Verdict: If you don&#39;t do Minecraft, you probably won&#39;t &#39;get&#39; this or any other set in the theme. &nbsp;But you still might want to give it a second look for parts. &nbsp;Pick one up second-hand if you can be sure it hasn&#39;t had too much sun. &nbsp;And you might surprise yourself once or twice&nbsp;during the build with the classic Lego &quot;I would never have thought of that&quot; moment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; its a nice print for the creeper and the iron golem it is a very nice build</p>
