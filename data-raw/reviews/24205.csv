"Dragon_Master_48","2015-12-26T02:40:34.95Z","Flawed Beauty","<p><strong>21122 The Nether Fortress</strong>&nbsp;is one of the latest sets in the Minecraft theme. The set provides a snapshot of an average day in the Nether, a lava world in the game which can be accessed through the aptly-named Nether Portal (which is also included in this set).&nbsp;I have mixed feelings about this set, but overall I think it&#39;s a pretty good set, albeit with a few minor flaws.</p>

<p>The build of this set is... not always so fun. While there&#39;s nothing particularly challenging, it can be tedious at&nbsp;times, and if you&#39;re not building it on a really, really solid surface, then let me give you a fair warning: you&#39;re not going to have fun.&nbsp;I feel like this set could use another three or four plates to hold the whole thing together... or some sort of other connections. If you&#39;re not building this set on, say, a table or desk, the different parts of this set will <em>not</em> hold together, and you will struggle keeping all the sections together. Trust me, I&#39;ve dealt with this. Don&#39;t do it. Save yourself.&nbsp;Despite all this, I think the satisfaction of the final product is worth the... troublesome building experience.</p>

<p>The minfigures&nbsp;and design of the set as a whole are charming and perfectly capture the Minecraft aesthetic. I particularly like the Ghast and Blaze, which are probably the best possible representations these memorable Nether&nbsp;creatures can get in LEGO.&nbsp;The play features work very well (dropping the lava is as fun as it sounds), and the buildable, interchangeable&nbsp;accessories are a great concept, wonderfully blending aspects of the original game and LEGO building. There is a good selection of minifigures here, allowing for a wide variety of play scenarios in the open space of the set (which is the perfect size for still having a good appearance).&nbsp;The various parts and colors used to achieve this are simply sublime- it does, in fact, look like a Nether Fortress. Special attention should also be brought to the Nether Portal; not only is it a spot-on representation of the structure, but it also adds even more color to keep the dark red- or any one color, for that matter- from dominating this set.</p>

<p>Even though you do get a lot in this set, I don&#39;t think the price is low enough to make this an immediate buy. $60 would be a perfect price for this set, and would be the cherry on top. Even a price decrease of $10 would make this set a greater value. If you&#39;re interested in buying this set, I would personally suggest you wait a little bit for some sort of sale- you might as well aim for that extra satisfaction!</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Overall appearance of the set and faithfulness to the game is great.</li>
	<li>Minifigures.</li>
	<li>Ghast.</li>
	<li>Interchangeable blocks blend Minecraft and LEGO very cleverly, without changing too much of the set.</li>
	<li>Other play features and general play possibilites&nbsp;are amazing.</li>
	<li>Good variety of parts and colors, both to accomplish what the set should, and offer great rebuildability.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Not fun to build depending on where you build it, and doesn&#39;t always stay together when not flat on a solid surface.</li>
	<li>A little bit too expensive.</li>
</ul>

<p>If not for the needlessly frustrating&nbsp;build and the price, I think this would be a really, really amazing set. If you like Minecraft, you should consider checking this set out- it&#39;s a great opportunity to see how you like LEGO. If you like LEGO, this is a great set just&nbsp;for building, playing, and admiration- even if you don&#39;t like Minecraft, you can still get a lot from this set. If you like both, well, you should probably buy this set (maybe on sale, though)!</p>

I&#39;ve had my eye on this set for a very long time but I never wanted to put all that money into it, so I didn&#39;t&nbsp;want&nbsp;to pass this up. Now that I have it, I am very glad that I waited until the sale, because $80 is a bit too much for this one.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are pretty average. There&#39;s a lot of orange and dark red, pretty much what you&#39;d expect for the Nether. Other than the cool, clear purple portal, there&#39;s not much else to say.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are fantastic! Each monster&nbsp;is exclusive to this set. I absolutely love the Ghast (if it counts as a minifigure), and the Blaze and Zombie Pigman look really nice. Steve and Alex both have diamond armor and weapons which are very nice.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was lots of&nbsp;fun, but I always love building Lego sets, so I can&#39;t really judge here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks...decent. I don&#39;t dislike it, it just isn&#39;t too impressive. With the minifigures added it looks a lot better, but it&#39;s just pretty bland. The features aren&#39;t much either.&nbsp;There&#39;s&nbsp;a switch that makes lava fall and the portal can be broken through (only one way though). They aren&#39;t very impressive.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The minifigures are really the greatest part of this set. If it weren&#39;t for the Ghast I probably wouldn&#39;t have wanted it as much, but I have to say the Ghast really does make it so much more worth it for me!&nbsp;The changeable face and fireballs&nbsp;make it so cool. The&nbsp;obsidian portal looks really great too. But, the set really is just average. If you&#39;re a huge fan of Minecraft, you&#39;ll like the set. But otherwise, it probably isn&#39;t worth your time or money.</p>

In 2015, LEGO suffered with dark red bricks being brittle and snapping very easily, and with that, my Nether Fortress is filled with cracked, snapped, or outright broken pieces. I&#39;ve gotten multiple replacements, and you just have to be okay with dealing with the slow replacement service on LEGO&#39;s site.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the build quality is nice (albeit tedious with the baseplates), and the minifigs here are really fun.</p>

<p>The Blaze included with this set is an earlier design that was vastly improved upon in later sets, along with the Ghast&#39;s appearance during his &quot;shooting&quot; feature (the use of a stud shooter just... doesn&#39;t work). The zombie pigman, while outdated, is nice, and Alex is always a welcome addition to my cast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play feature in this set is kind of lame, just a stack of lava you can make fall with an admittedly scary mechanism that involves stressing one of your pieces. I understand what they&#39;re going for, but you&#39;re better off building this to display. Despite this, I do appreciate the use of Glowstone instead of an exposed lever, something LEGO Minecraft has been bad about as of late.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brittle pieces, aftermarket price gouging, and outdated designs aside, this is a great set, and a little patience will go a long way for an owner.</p>
