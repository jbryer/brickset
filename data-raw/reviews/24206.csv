<p>The builds include a little jet pack for Zane which can also be converted into a hover board. The next side build of the set is a small holder for the white arrow blade. The main build of the set is a large ghost like motor cycle with 2 large wheels at the back and 1 at the front it has some amazing designs with exhausts that make it look like a hot rod vehicle and a cockpit seat for a minifigure and space in the back for accessories. This build has many cool play features such as some stuff shooters on the side and a catapult at the back to launch off some chains.</p>

<p>The minifigures in the set are the arigitzu version of Zane which is nice to get in another set and he weilds a ice staff build. The next two minifigures are both ghosts and the first one is Cowler who looks cool and has some good printing and great transparent parts but he is a very common fig and comes in a lot of other sets. The last minifig is wrayth who looks incredible with his ghost mask and bandage and chain printing and he also holds this big wrayth ghost weapon.</p>

<p>Overall this set has a good design and good minifigures and is very reminiscent of the vehicle from the show but this set is a retail exclusive which makes it harder to find and is an easy set to pass up on. Still I would definitely recommend this set to fans of Lego Ninjago for the awesome chain cycle, great Minifigs and amazing value.</p>
