<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is the same as any other box, the details are nice on the front and back. The instructions are easy to read and colorful, nothing to much and nothing to little, one sticker sheet, and one instruction booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with 214 parts, it has some parts in newer colors, and some parts only included in the Ninjago Line,&nbsp;and before 2016 it had an exclusive part in this set, and that&nbsp;was the gold&nbsp;Exhaust Pipe M/Snap, and some other rarer parts that have appeared in less than 10 sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has 2 minifigures Overall, it showed the ghost&#39;s as minifigures on the box, but I wouldn&#39;t count them as minifigures, they are more like parts that can be used on a minifigure, to make it seem like they are possessed. Cole comes with a scythe like weapon and an aeroblade, a special weapon given&nbsp;to them by Ronin the Mercenary that can take down ghosts, Cole has some nice Front/Back/Leg printing, and a nice detailed mask, the head is the same and the arms have no printing. The Ghost Warrior is almost the same as other Ghosts so I will not state his name because&nbsp;he has so many Doppelganger&#39;s&nbsp;I just call him Ghost Warrior, he comes with a fiery ghost type weapon and ghoulish torso/leg printing, along with a recolored&nbsp;Hat and Mask from previous Ninjago Sub-Themes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple and easy, the dragon is relatively easy that you can build it without looking at the instructions, the bike on the other hand is clever the way they have the pipes going through, and the way they put the&nbsp;Six Shooter Housing that can conceal itself behind the rocks on the vehicle, and then raise up when its ready to go to war, plus it has a clip piece that can hold the scythe like weapon when he is driving, but he will have to hold the aeroblade</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is very good, the dragon has no ball joints and uses all clip pieces so all the limbs can only go up and down, but it gives a good flying motion when you are playing with it, the blaster bike is very creative the way the silver pipes go into the &quot;Engine&quot; and the way the 6-Barrel stud shooter can go down to conceal itself, and up to fire when an enemy is nearby.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I say this is a very good build overall, the dragon has nice decently sized limbs, only bad thing is he does not have a mouth, the bike is very well built and versatile, but it could use a kick-stand.</p>

<p>The only thing I find bad about this is the red cross axle part that can be spotted near the wheels on the bike, it doesn&#39;t seem out of place I just would rather have a black cross axle.</p>
