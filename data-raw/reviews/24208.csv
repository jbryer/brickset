<h3>&nbsp;The Box</h3>

<p>The box has a red background with the &quot;Green Ninja&quot; in the corner. &nbsp;From the looks of it he is turning into a ghost. &nbsp;The front has the dragon flying in to action. &nbsp;Plus the &quot;tea garden gate&quot; and &nbsp;a&quot;tea cart&quot; as Cole fighting one of the ghost. &nbsp;In the bottom corner showing the 5 Mini-Figures. &nbsp;The top of the box shows the mini-Figures&nbsp;with their names, also showing a &quot;Skreemer&quot; with the ninja&#39;s&nbsp;dog. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The back of the box showing a close up of the dragons head, Cole &amp; Wu sharing some tea, another picture of the &quot;Skreemer&quot; trying to feed the dog, the &quot;<br />
tea cart&quot; in action,&nbsp;&nbsp;and another picture of the dragon in action with the &quot;tea gate&quot; in the&nbsp;background plus it is&nbsp;showing a &quot;Skreemer&quot; possessing Cole. &nbsp;The last thing on the back is showing how many &quot;Aero-Blades&quot; come&nbsp;in the set this one only has&nbsp;the fifth one. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One of the best reasons to get this sets. &nbsp;And it come with a lot of parts for only $40 USD. &nbsp;The front of the box states it has 575 parts, but if you&nbsp;add&nbsp;the spare part the total goes up&nbsp;to&nbsp;623 parts. &nbsp;The most note worthy spare parts to mention are the extra weapons which are: 3 different&nbsp;color katanas, a bow&nbsp;with arrow, 2 axe head clips, a the new &quot;Ghostly Blade&quot;. &nbsp;Not to mention all the &quot;new colored&quot; parts that this set has in it. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Mini-Figures</h3>

<p>Like I mention earlier&nbsp;it has 5 mini-figures,&nbsp;plus the two &quot;animals&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The main guy this set is named after: Master Wu comes with a new suit and a staff for a weapon. &nbsp;Next up is Cole and his new suit, his weapons are an axe plus a katana. &nbsp;The &quot;ninja&#39;s dog&quot; is dragging around a crossbow (how he shoots it, I don&#39;t know). &nbsp;</p>

<p>For the ghost: first&nbsp;up&nbsp;is&nbsp;Soul Archer his weapons is the obvious Bow with Arrow plus a knife, &nbsp;he does have the new &quot;ghost legs&quot; and a&nbsp;new hood piece. &nbsp;Second one is Pitch he has a purple &quot;straw hat&quot; he use a pitch-fork and a knife for weapons. &nbsp;Hackler come with the second new hood piece with the &quot;ghost blade&quot; and two katanas&nbsp;plus his shield which has&nbsp;a&nbsp;sticker on it. &nbsp;Last one is Skreemer&nbsp;now he is just one part.&nbsp; From what I seen, I thought his arm could move around but they do not. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>You start out with the &quot;tea cart&quot; in book one. &nbsp;And finished off the book with the &quot;tea garden&quot;. &nbsp;Book two (the bigger of the two) mainly builds the dragon (and finished him off). &nbsp;The last&nbsp;couple of pages of book two has advertisements for the other set in this wave (but no spinners are advertised). &nbsp;And the parts list with the green ninja on the back cover yelling WIN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I will start off with the cart I have a felling that the roof will be falling over for the kids. &nbsp;It is only connected&nbsp;at the front and it is a pivot&nbsp;point. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The &quot;tea gate&quot; over all is good for some Asian&nbsp;architect. &nbsp; (With some weird&nbsp;placed flick fire missiles.)</p>

<p>The &quot;Asian&nbsp;Dragon&quot; has two points that I feel is wrong with it. &nbsp;The first one is the wings now they look cool but &quot;Asian&nbsp;Dragons&quot; do not have wings they just swim in the air. &nbsp;&nbsp;The second point is about the tail it looks a little to thin for my taste (I guess we would just have to build up with our spare parts). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The main reason I got the set was for the parts. &nbsp;I mostly wanted the new &quot;Ninjago&quot; parts. &nbsp;And it seems the best set to get them in one go for a great price. &nbsp;The &quot;Asian Dragon&quot; is a good model over all (except&nbsp;the two points&nbsp;I mention above). &nbsp;I am curious&nbsp;to see what people will do with the new &quot;Aero-Blade&quot; part. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Some other bad points are: I wished it comes with another Skreemer or two. &nbsp;Second one is with &quot;Cole&#39;s Mantle&quot; it does not want ot&nbsp;let the katanas slide in to well. &nbsp;I feel I will break&nbsp;them or bend the swords getting them in or out of the mantle. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Fauch","2015-10-28T19:46:09.55Z","Great set, very creative build.","<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set features many uncommon parts such as white croissants, white space blasters, some new grass pieces, genie lamp, unikitty&#39;s tails, elephant trunks, handles for paint roller and even a dog. oddly there is a camera too.</p>

<p>Some uncommon colors such as a decent amount of dark orange and earth blue and a bit of spring yellowish green.</p>

<p>Some items are new in gold, like the 2x2 round profile bricks, the large flame pieces that make the wings, 1x1 plates, and the golden bows of the body.</p>

<p>Many great spare pieces as well, such as extra of most weapons (like the ghost sword&nbsp;and the compound bow, but not the crossbow), 2 gold bars, 2 gold light saber hilt, and it&#39;s also the first time I get a spare snot piece&nbsp;(neck bracket)</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>Great, though for my first set of the latest ninjago wave, I find them slightly less good so far than the figs of the anacondrai wave.</p>

<p>Cole : Great printing overall, headpiece molded in 2 colours with black and grey, head is single sided like usual, and I presume identical to the original 2011 Cole, though that&#39;s the only Cole fig I own so far.</p>

<p>Wu : Great printing overall. Compared with my Wu from 2011 fire temple, the head is the same, but the printing is of slightly better quality.</p>

<p>Pitch : Printing is ok, but seems inferior to the 2 previous figures in terms of details. Legs are transparent green. Very nice black head with prints in spring yellowish green and what might be sand blue. Large eyes, huge eyebrows, possibly some beard?</p>

<p>Hackler : Prints are the same than on Pitch. The shield is a sticker. Nice transparent green head with purple eyebrows and vampire fangs. Great head piece in earth blue with a transparent green back for whatever reason, which allows light to go through the head. The new sword is some opaque dark green color with transparent green around and it kinda looks like green flames.</p>

<p>Soul Archer : He has better torso printings than the 2 other ghosts. The head is transparent green with a beard and a metallic head band that is also printed on the back of the head, but the head appears dark and opaque under the head piece which doesnt&nbsp;let the light go through. Very nice new pieces on this one, the head piece is earth blue and purple, the shoulder pads are earth blue and I think titanium metallic, and the leg piece is earth blue and transparent green and can sit on 2 studs.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build is varried and uses many advanced technics, like technic build and snot, including studs on bottom and many original uses of pieces. Overall, it felt like the most creative build since I built arkham asylum breakout last year. Note that some steps could be challenging.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>It actually contains several models.</p>

<p>A dog carrying a crossbow which is pretty cute, then you have a haunted chariot, it carries a green crystal, some tiles with ghost faces printed on them and a cup of tea. by pushing an axle at the back you can activate the disk shooter, and it shoots pretty strong. The roof can fall.</p>

<p>The tea farm, nice looking build which is quite large (30 studs large), includes some nice built, like the top of the torii with all those blades, and the ornament on the left, great build with very few pieces. There are 2 fick missiles on the right side (the 2 gold pieces).&nbsp;The tea farm is made of 7 parts linked by ball joints, which gives a lot of flexibility on how to display it, though more classic hinge pieces would have felt more appropriate and wouldn&#39;t have left gaps between each parts.</p>

<p>The dragon is the main build, dimensions depends on how you pose it, but you could consider over 35&nbsp;cm long and over 20 cm wings to wings. Legs are articulated with technic joints at the top, and ball joints for the feet, the tail has a lot of flexibility. The head is on a ball joint, but is slightly heavy and sometimes fall. The body recreates a S shape with some success, though has an obvious flaw.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff327/Fauch_/DSC04454_zps2n6cb013.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 333px;"" /></p>

<p>The head is probably the best part of the build and features great building technics. It almost looks alive. However the lower jaw is a failure as it looks like it is attached under the head instead of being part of it, and it looks bad, unless seen from the front with the mouth closed.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i536.photobucket.com/albums/ff327/Fauch_/DSC04455_zpstz7utsyt.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 333px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>Lots of content and playability, great parts, unique building experience, though the overall excellence is tainted by a few flaws.</p>

<p>Edit : after a few months, I remove a point from the final note due to better dragon models such as the green NRG Dragon or Queen dragon&#39;s rescue having been released.</p>

"richselby","2015-11-22T00:09:45.327Z","Five Star Oriental Dragon Sculpture","<p>What drew me in here was the wonderful brick-built oriental dragon&nbsp;at the heart of this set. How different from the original Ninjago run of&nbsp;dragons with their 2 piece rubber&nbsp;moulded heads. The&nbsp;dragon here is full of character and a joy to build.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid I&nbsp;haven&#39;t got a clue about the Ninjago characters / storylines, so I&#39;m sure many of the&nbsp;details, e.g. the turquoise aladdin&#39;s lamp piece and the 3 pronged weapon staff,&nbsp;went clean over my head. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A standard mid-sized retail box, two instruction booklets and a dreaded sticker sheet. Like many an AFOL,&nbsp;I chose not to apply the stickers, which was no great loss except for the gold sign at the top of the Chinese temple. That looked a bit empty in its stickerless state. I wish they&#39;d printed that one.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The designer has really crammed in the Nice Parts Usage for this set. In no particular order, I was delighted by the:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Paint roller handles, from the Collectible Minifig series, used as lantern holders</li>
	<li>Croissants. We&#39;ve previously&nbsp;seen the white version of&nbsp;these&nbsp;used&nbsp;as architectural details in 10243 Parisien Restaurant. And in this set, they&#39;re curvy&nbsp;dragon horns</li>
	<li>Camera. Used as a jauntily angled stand for a viewfinder above&nbsp;the flick missile launcher</li>
	<li>Unikitty tails. The dragon&#39;s moustache</li>
	<li>Wheel arches. The dragon&#39;s eyebrows</li>
	<li>Gold flame things used as wing feathers</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Five of&nbsp;them to play with, which seems generous. One of the figures has forsaken his legs for a&nbsp;wraith-style&nbsp;base element that I previously encountered with&nbsp;the ghosts in the Halloween&nbsp;Series 13 Collectible Minifigures. Then there&#39;s a cute husky dog. And best of all, there&#39;s a, well,&nbsp;&nbsp;let&#39;s call him a Little Meany. A trans lime head hugger thing that looks like he&#39;s popped over from the set of&nbsp;Ghostbusters. Cute.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two meanies&nbsp;and no husky would have been better for play purposes, I think.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The dragon does not disappoint. We start with his torso, which features some lovely curved gold detailing, built&nbsp;the right way&nbsp;and upside down. The legs owe something to the constraction line, especially the feet on ball joints. The wings&nbsp;curve elegantly, thanks to repetition of a Technic angled axle connector. And the dragon&#39;s head is a sculptural masterpiece, full&nbsp;of inventive part use. Unlike a previous reviewer, I don&#39;t have a problem with the droid arms used to connect the lower jaw piece. It looks fine to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tail is a bit of a let down. It looks like a scorpion&#39;s sting, rather than the continuation of a strong serpent-like body.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the two minor models, firstly we have an over-engineered food-hawker cart. The roof is heavy and&nbsp;held up in an unusual&nbsp;but not entirely successful&nbsp;way. The cart&nbsp;can fire pizza disks,&nbsp;thanks to a special hollowed out 1 x 4 brick. &nbsp;Secondly, there&#39;s a&nbsp;bit of Ninjago chinoiserie in the form of a shrine. You can launch flick missiles from it, in retaliation for those flying pizza disks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not that there&#39;s anything wrong with the rest of the set, but this one is worth it&nbsp;for the wonderful dragon alone.</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-23T08:07:54.73Z","Beautifully sculpted Dragon with some nice add ons","<p>I really like this dragon. It&#39;s a nice comfortable size. With a ton of character, just like his master. &nbsp;The additional scenery pieces really flesh out the set. They include a small piece of Sensei Wu&#39;s retirement Tea Farm and a nice little Noodle Cart being used by the Ghosts to stage an attack. So lots of playability.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions -&nbsp;</strong>Pretty standard. Instructions are 2 stapled booklets.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>A great assortment that really add to the set</p>

<p>Sensei Wu - White Robes with broad Silver and Gold printing across his torso. Front/Back and Leg printing.He has the gold version of his hat. He carries a golden staff weapon with two horns at the top and joy of joys his blue teapot with a curl of smoke (fire?) coming from it. (OK it&#39;s the CMF Geanie&#39;s lamp, but it works)</p>

<p>Cole - in one of his standard black well printed get ups. He has the two colored mask, plus black shoulders and scabbards. His weapons are swords plus a large golden staff/axe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doggie - We have Sensei Wu&#39;s Dog, armed with his little side mounted wheeled Crossbow. Good Doggie</p>

<p>Soul Archer - One of the more distinct of the Ghosts. The wraithlike Soul Archer. He is a gorgeous figure. His legs are the two color trans neon green and normal green swirled to form the vaporus&nbsp;ghostlike lower body that we have seen in Ninjago, CMF&#39;s and Ghostbusters. His Torso has the most detailed printing of the 3 baddies, with some very nice front and back printing. He further has a 2 color armor piece for his torso and shoulders that looks like tattered cloth. His head is trans neon green with a ghostly face with a metal headband. His cowl is a new 2 color one, with a semi pointed top and a purple band. He weilds&nbsp;a Hawkeye style Bow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hackler - A Ghost Ninja. He has the standard Trans neon&nbsp;ghost legs that most have and the same torso as Pitch. His head is in Trans neon and he wears a new 2 part Ninja cowl, where the backhalf is also trans neon, giving him some cool effects including some light piping to his eyes. He has a classic X shaped PoP scabbard with two neon green swords. He also carries a stickered shield and a large flaming green sword/axe weapon. One problem he does suffer from. With the Trans clear head and elements of the hood trans clear, his head gets stuck in his hood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pitch - Ghost Warrior His legs and torso are the same as Hackler. He has a printed black ghost head and wears a dark blue bandana and Wu style straw hat in purple. he has a basket on his back and carries a pitchfork</p>

<p>Screamer - We get one soul possesing Screamer in this set. With the most common face print. These things are great. A Ghostly version of the Alien Brain Suckers from Alien Conquest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Pretty much the entire set is unexpected, unusual or interesting parts used in even more interesting ways. From strange colors to creative uses for things you just weren&#39;t expecting. The Dragon&#39;s Head in particular is all rare or atypically colored odd parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build/Model -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;All three builds are quite good. The two smaller builds are the Ghosts weaponized Noodle Cart, and a part of Sensei Wu&#39;s Tea Garden. Both do the job and have some great detailing. The Noodle cart can fire disks, but still looks great as a pushcart. Wu&#39;s Tea Garden has some neat part use to form the lanterns and the asian arch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Dragon itself is a really nice design. Granted articulation is, meh, but it makes up for it in good looks. The head is a masterpiece, achieving a true brick built asian&nbsp;dragon looking head. The body flows well and is servicable. The tail is kind of scrawny however. The hero factory lightning bolts in gold giv ethe wings a somewhat hairy and asian feel to them. They feel like something other than normal traditional bay wings on a dragon. They have some limited posability.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>A great set at a fantastic price for what it comes with. 5 minifigs&nbsp;a dog. An Aeroblade. Disk Shooters and Flick Fires. There is a lot to like here. Not perfect. But good value.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong> Amazing minifigures! Three ghosts, (Who doesn&#39;t want more ghosts?) Cole, (Who doesn&#39;t want more Cole?) And Sensei Wu! (Who doesn&#39;t want more WU!?!)</p>

<p><strong>Dragon: </strong>The dragon is Amazing as well! It has a chainsaw tail, golden wings, and massive claws! If you look at the head, you will see that his horns are made of <em>Croissants</em>!</p>

<p>Taking a look back to the rest of the set, you will see there is a LOT included in it. The dog, the tea-stand, the aeroblade holder, THE TEAPOT!</p>

<p>I give this set a total four and a half out of five stars. It would&#39;ve been five if the price was a teeny bit lower,&nbsp;but its still a great set just the same!</p>
