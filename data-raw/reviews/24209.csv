<p>The box is a rare square shape, though its sides are not completely identical in length. The cover art is pretty cool, with the main model R.E.X. taking up most of the front. Kai can also be seen spinning in the air behind the vehicle, something we&#39;ll get into a little bit later. There are also&nbsp;two instruction manuals included in this set, sealed inside a separate bag, something you don&#39;t see too often in store models.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts you recieve in this set&nbsp;are awesome, as you get a wide assortment of dark green and burgundy, two of my favorite colors that are&nbsp;rare in LEGO&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;Some notable specific pieces include several Sensei Wu&#39;s hats, black droid legs from the Star Wars theme, and a lot&nbsp;of&nbsp;rare technic pieces. Oh, and the Sword of Sanctuary, which was a nice surprise&nbsp;since you can&#39;t see it in pictures.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;in this wave are phenomenal in my opinion, and the four&nbsp;that come in this set are by far one of the best assortments you will see this year from the Ninjago theme. If you watched the cartoon, then you would understand why Ghoultar&nbsp;is in so many sets, and the addition of Attila adds to the storyline, especially with the dragon&nbsp;mini-model that she&nbsp;comes with. Meanwhile Kai, the hero of the set, looks awesome with his newly designed black robes and red and black hood, ready for battle with his red Aeroblade. But it is the final, only&nbsp;exclusive minifigure that trumps&nbsp;them all. Brandishing two swords, double stud-shooters, and a rare burgundy mask, Ronin&nbsp;is&nbsp;the one character everyone will be after. There&#39;s a reason why he&nbsp;headlines the title.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set was so much&nbsp;fun, and I just&nbsp;could not stop (I actually missed eating lunch). Throughout the process you are introduced to new ways of building that have never been seen before, techniques that you may have seen&nbsp;but are still a blast to build,&nbsp;and a final surprise at the end that I&#39;ll leave to&nbsp;find out for yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed R.E.X. is an absolute work of art. Seriously, whoever designed this is a genius. From the clever cockpit in the front to the Airjitzu spinner mechanism&nbsp;in the back, there is nothing left to be desired here. Sure, there are some small gaps and openings spread throughout, but because of the overall design and the way it looks, it just works. I can&#39;t say enough of how much I love this set. A beautiful&nbsp;recreation of what has quickly become&nbsp;an iconic vehicle in the Ninjago franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>5 out of 5,&nbsp;10 out of 10, 100 out of 100, you could not get any better than this. Trust me,&nbsp;if you have $50 to spend&nbsp;and are looking for a great&nbsp;set to buy, then pick this one up before it&#39;s gone. I assure you that you won&#39;t regret it.</p>
