<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box that carries the dragon is slim but very long &amp; wide. Did not think the box art match up to the impressiveness of the actual build.</p>

<p>There&#39;s 1 thick booklet, which I thought was better than having 2 or 3 of those.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The sand green parts are naturally the highlights of the brick contents. However, the main structure of the dragon are built up mostly with black and navy blue parts.</p>

<p>The wings are made from some canvas material and definitely feels like its going to last. Lego put in additional effort to pack them with a cardboard to make sure they do not get crumbled in the box and that&#39;s appreciated.</p>

<p>Additionally, weapons for Yokai and Cowler has glow-in-the-dark parts and that&#39;s always special.</p>

<p>On top of that, there&#39;s a brick separator.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>6 minifigs. Naturally, the Evil Green Ninja is the big draw &amp; for those looking to build up the ghost army, there will be 3 in this set with Yokai, Cowler and Wrayth. There&#39;s also 2 skreemers.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was for me one of the most enjoyable build. From the body, then the head, the limbs &amp; finally the wings, you see this demonic dragon slowly taking form right in front of your eyes.</p>

<p>The brick-build head deserved a special mention here. It is just great. I wonder/doubt if Lego can do a livelier dragon head with standard bricks.</p>

<p>The build for the shrine and rides for the ninjas, on the other hand are pretty pedestrian.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed Morro Dragon is just filled with awesomeness. It&#39;s going be one of the main highlight for any Lego displays.</p>

<p>The curvature of the body draws resemblance from the ancient Japanese/Chinese dragon which fits the Ninjago theme even more.</p>

<p>The sand green, navy blue &amp; black colors scheme bring out that evil in the dragon up a level.</p>

<p>Play feature however, is on the lower side. The really isn&#39;t much you can play with.</p>

<p>The shrine &amp; the rides for Kay and Jay are bonuses. For me its all about the dragon.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Price/piece is on the higher side but do not let it deter you from getting in my opinion, one of best dragon build from Lego.</p>

"vikings","2016-07-04T19:15:29.593Z","Best Ninjago dragon yet!!","<p>I got this set a few days ago and was happy that I finally had the Morro&nbsp;Dragon. I got this set on clearance for $50.00 at Target ( regular price $70.00 ). When I was done building it, it was bigger than I thought it would be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: The box is a long and narrow with dimensions of 54 x 28.2 x 5.9 cm. , and weighs 0.99 kg ( 2.19 lbs.). The box is not the best box every with not a lot showing about the dragon it&#39;s self. The instructions&nbsp;came in a bag with the stickers. The instructions were big and thick. A little smaller than I thought they would be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: In this set you get unique pieces that you won&#39;t get in every set ( a lot on the dragon&#39;s head ). Along with that you also get a lot of pale green pieces for the dragon which I thought were very cool. The wings came in a plastic and were made of a fabric type item which I thought was nice so it should last a while. Downside to that is that the wings were at the bottom and bent a little. Luckily putting something heavy on top of them for a while fixed that problem. You also get some glow in the dark pieces that you get often anymore. You get three whitish missile tops for the ghosts weapons and then 6 whitish dots for the realm&nbsp;crystal shrine. The total piece count for this set is 658 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: In this set you get a total of 8 minifigurers which included:&nbsp;&nbsp;Jay, Kai, Evil Green Ninja, Wrayth, Yokai, Cowler, and 2 skreemers. Jay and Kai both come with there aero blades and also come with each a gold and black ninja sword. The Evil Green Ninja was the minifigure I was most excited&nbsp;for and was good with lots of detail. The only downside to him is that his weapon isn&#39;t as good as it should unless you look at at it as something he uses to control his dragon. Wrayth&nbsp;comes with his cain you see in the other sets he is in and in the TV show as well. Yoikai and Cowler each come with the 3 glow in the dark missile pieces I was talking about before on there weapons both have ok weapons and cowler has to pale green ninja swords on his back. Last the two skreemers, one comes with and axe and hot dog while the other comes with a thing of TNT and a bannana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The build was really good nothing hard unless you have trouble with technic building. The best part of the build besides finsihing it was build the head of the dragon. It was not hard but cool to see it come together all at once. The build for me took around a 30-60 minutes to complete the entire set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: When finished the set was amazing. The realm crystal shrine was good except for that the sides are really loose and move way to much. The speeders that Kai and Jay were good could have been a little better in my opinion. The dragon itself was awesome. There is so much detail put into the dragon. Overall for the complete model very good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: My overall opinion for this set is that it is the best dragon every for ninjago so far. It has a lot of ghost so it good if you want a ghost army or something like that. The set is good for all ages depending on how good you are. If you are just a beginner or young I do not recommend&nbsp;this for you other wise it is good for everyone else. Overall opinion for this set is a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
