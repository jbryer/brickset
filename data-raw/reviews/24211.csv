<p>The set&nbsp;<b>70737&nbsp;</b>belongs to the 2nd&nbsp;<b>Ninjago 2015&nbsp;</b>collection, it comes in a box of medium-large size and consists of:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Zane&#39;s Titan mech</li>
	<li>Blade Master Bansha&rsquo;s Ghost mech</li>
	<li>five minifigs: Ghoultar, Bansha, Zane, Jay, Nya</li>
	<li>Samurai x Cave features a spring-loaded hook shooter with a hook on a string and assorted elements: the Aeroblade, tools, computer</li>
</ul>

<p>It is aimed at an audience of at least eight years old, and in this case I think that to say that if you want to give it to child with a year less you have to make sure that he have sufficient experience with LEGO bricks and in particular with those TECHNIC to make sure that he is able to peacefully assemble and play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opening the box set, there are six envelopes containing the bricks; as usual, you starts with the envelope 1 and it begins with the assembly of the minifigs of&nbsp;<b>Jay, Nya, Ghoultar</b>, then move on to the two scenarios of samurai x cave with&nbsp;spring-loaded hook shooter with a hook on a string; then passes to the envelope 2 which starts with the&nbsp;assembly of the Zane&#39;s minifigs and continue with the upper part of the Zane&#39;s &nbsp;mech that is completed with all the bricks in the envelope 3.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The envelope 4 begins with the assembly of the Bansha&#39;s minifigs and continues with the upper part of the Bansha&#39;s mech, which is completed with envelopes 5 and 6.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As already &#39;I wrote above, the assembly of the two mechs requires more attention than usual, because to ensure all possible movements and joints to the mech, these are a lot of Lego Technic pieces and connection joints/rotations. The end result, consists of two mechs nice to see and to play with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Analyzing in detail the two mechs, I can say that the Zane one is practically perfect and stable! it moves, rotates and holds easily; while, the Bansha&#39;s mech is nice but perfectible for stability, it is not free from criticism both as regards the balance, sometimes unstable due to excessive possibility of rotation of the ball joints in the feet, and regarding the articulation of the four arms, which due to the overlap of two arms per side, causes interference in the movement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After completing the assembly I consider it useful to point out:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>PRO</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Innovative Design of both mech</li>
	<li>Very slim, lightweight design of the Zane&#39;s mech</li>
	<li>Stability of Zane&#39;s mech</li>
	<li>Five minifigs (three ninja)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>AGAINST</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Instability of Bansha&#39; mech</li>
	<li>Interference of the four arms of the Bansha&#39;s mech</li>
	<li>Brick in the decorations on the Bansha&#39; mech helmet little resistant to grip.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>

<p>The set&nbsp;<b>70737&nbsp;</b>is very interesting for the presence of two mechs and five minifigs; as I reported above, the mech Bansha have some critics, but along with Zane ones, is very attractive and I think is one of the two /three &nbsp;2015 Lego Ninjago set wanted by children fans of the series; Moreover, the price of 55euro id medium-high but could be justified by the contents of the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall evaluation</b></p>

<p>Very good</p>
