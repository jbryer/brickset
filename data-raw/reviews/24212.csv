<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is accurate an illustrates the build well and the instructions are very easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are diverse and interesting.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are well modeled and the amount of them increase the playability hugely.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;construction was enjoyable because there were many part types such as Technic and regular lego.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks amazing and has many functions although it is fairly hard to carry around. The folding booster rockets and the bike are the coolest features.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is one of my favorite sets and I would recommend it to anyone that likes displaying their lego, fantasy sets or Ninjago.</p>

This is also the first really large and complex build I&#39;ve ever done but it was a wonderful building experience.</p>

<p>I was a bit intimidated by there being well over 1000 pieces to this set, but LEGO always makes it easy to guide you step by step through the build. And this set has a ton of small builds that add up to the overall model. There is a complex and working sail system, the ship fires projectiles, the rear bridge has a hinged access with a detailed deck and hidden vehicle - there&#39;s a lot going on here.</p>

<p>In fact the parts I didn&#39;t like had nothing to do with the ship:&nbsp;the dragon. The dragon stands very unstable and it can only ever stand on its hind&nbsp;legs (when it stands on all fours it look comically bad)&nbsp;meaning that if you put a rider on it the rider will be sitting parallel to the ground and looks bad. The head of the dragon is something Picasso&nbsp;would have designed in that it resembles a dragons head, but is too abstract to be very good.&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31032-1/Red-Creatures"">31032:&nbsp;Red Creatures</a>&nbsp;has the best dragon head I&#39;ve yet seen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a lot of minifigures, but half of them are ghastly green demon things that I didn&#39;t care for. I don&#39;t watch the show and so I have no interest in the bad guys. The good guys are much better looking, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But even with the stuff I didn&#39;t care for, this was a great purchase and I loved putting this together. I learned more building this one model than pretty much any other LEGO build I&#39;ve yet done. It took me awhile (5 hours - though I was also watching the AFC Championship game at the same time) but I will have this ship displyed for years to come.</p>

<p>Fantastic building experience, beautiful ship, horrible dragon, expensive ($120 new at Target US), lots of play potential.</p>

<p>For parts, oh yes. The big printed dragon disc thing, The wings for the ghost dragon, great stuff here too.</p>

<p>For the figures, the ghost guys have some incredibly nice prints. Great to get moro with the cape. Deepstone Lloyd is also a fantastic figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the models, we have the bounty and the ghost dragon.</p>

<p>Ghost dragon, or a whyvern since it has 2 legs? Looks pretty cool i think. unique design, but i think it turns out good. the legs being connected to a part with 2 joints is not great. limits articulation. The dragon can hold a figure inside the mouth, that adds for some additional play fun.</p>

<p>The main destiny&#39;s bounty looks so nice. but this set has some play features too.</p>

<p>A little compartment at the back can be taken out to reveal a little workshop for nya.</p>

<p>It has some tools and a flying scooter?. Weird, but another flying thing is good to have</p>

<p>the thrusters can transform by pulling out a thing on the back with some spring loaded shooters. transformation process is smooth and the thrusters look really nice once it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>then the sails can move. a lot of ugly technic stuff under the sails but the transformation itself is actually pretty good.</p>

<p>You have some little cages to hold minifig weapons. There&#39;s a dragon head at the front, and it looks nice but, what is that stick thing at the front? don&#39;t like that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>there&#39;s a decent amount of room to hold some minifigs here.</p>

<p>there&#39;s a handle thing to hold the bounty, which for kid hands is not very well sized.</p>

<p>there is a triple fire stud shooter function where you can shoot 3 studs at 1 time. i don&#39;t like stud shooters as they normally go all across the room never to be seen again.</p>

<p>So overall, yes i really like this set, has that big stick and the technic stuff, otherwise flawless.</p>
