<p>I&#39;ll be reviewing set 70704, the Airjitzu Jay Flyer!</p>

<p>This set retails for $9.99 and is recomended for ages 6-14</p>

<p>This set does include 45 pieces out of which six are new molds (Both cockpit parts, flyer itself, ripcord, base, and new shurikens) and four new prints (torso, legs, mask, 2x2 round tile).</p>

<p>The building experience only takes about 5 minutes, which is pretty fair due to its low piece amount.</p>

<p>This set includes 1 minifigure which uses exclusive prints all over the minifigure.</p>

<p>This is a set you MUST get even if your not a Lego fan because of its infinite playability and because if the inclusion of rare pieces.</p>
