<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a very odd shape, like a stretched hexagon that tapers upward. It&#39;s eye-catching, but very awkward. The graphics are good, and I especially like the art in the lower right corner &nbsp;on all of the boxes, showing&nbsp;the ninja/ghost flying in the air.&nbsp;I would have preferred regular rectangular boxes. The instructions are clear as always.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some pretty nice pieces in this set. The brown shells used on the handle could be useful, and I don&#39;t believe the car slopes on the sides are common in brown. I also like the translucent orange round dishes on the scythe weapon. Interestingly, an Uruk-Hai sword is used in one of the weapons, and two sausages are included. The printed 2x2 round tile and updated shurikens are also nice to have.</p>

<p>The new Airjitzu parts are very interesting. The launcher&nbsp;is basically a 2x4 brick with the receiver&nbsp;attachment and some Technic pin holes in the sides. The flyer consists of three parts. The base is a black piece with a pin on the bottom, this fits into the launcher brick. There is a cavity inside that fits a minfigure standing up, although nothing would hold them in if not for the bubble canopy, which attaches with pins to the holes on the base and surrounds the figure very closely. This then fits into the flying ring and twists to lock in place. There is a new ripcord which is as thick as a full Technic beam at the handle, which has three pin holes. The rest of the ripcord can only be used with the flyer.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Cole is the only minifigure in this set, and he is in Airjitzu mode. His mask is black, and so are his torso and legs. His head and arms are orange, and his head has Cole&#39;s face in a darker orange with golden earth energy around his eyes. His torso has orange cracks on it, with a white character, presumably standing for &quot;Earth&quot; in the middle. Some golden chunks of earth are also present. His legs are mostly black, but the orange cracks continue to the top of the legs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is mostly focused on creating the handle for the launcher. This build is identical for all of the flyers, but the colors and decorated tile are different in each set. The build is fairly straightforward, but the katanas&nbsp;in the sides of the handle are interesting. The weapons are also built up, but I don&#39;t particularly care for either of them.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks all right, but the whole thing is meant to be functional. When the ripcord is inserted while the flyer is in place and pulled out, the flyer will lift out of the handle and fly. Depending on how quickly the ripcord is pulled out, the flyer will fly at varying heights. If it lands on a smooth surface, it will spin like a top for a while. One can tilt the launcher&nbsp;to aim the flyer, which is fun to practice with, and it can go great distances if aimed properly and launched with enough force.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is purely a functional toy, but it is so much fun! The mechanism is simple, but it works so well, and could lead to long sessions of outdoor play. I would definitely recommend picking up one of these sets, since the parts are nice and the function is even better!</p>

<p>This set contains a&nbsp;Cole Minifigur, a few Minifigure&nbsp;acessories, one Cole Airjitsu&nbsp;flyer, one Airjitsu flyer launcher, and a Airjitsu flyer ripcord.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure is Cole Airjitsu which is exclusive to this set. He has orange arms, and an orange face.</p>

<p>Cole&#39;s acessories&nbsp;are; a sword, a scythe like weapon, two shurikens, and two hot dogs to get him sick while in flight.</p>

<p>The Airjitsu&nbsp;launcher ripcord is just like all of them and is nothing special.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Airjitsu&nbsp;launcher is just like the other ones but it has Cole&#39;s symbol on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Airjitsu flyer is just like the others but in Metallic gold this time, and can hold a Minifigure just like the rest.</p>

<p>This set not only looks cool on display, but is fun to launch out in the yard, especially on a windy day. It is also fun to do voice impersonations of the Ninja by saying<strong> ninJAGO!&nbsp;</strong>while launching it.</p>

<p>My only complaints are that the ripcord wears out the piece in the launcher that is goes through. My other complaint would be that they do not make them any more and the Ninja do not use it much in the Ninjago show after they learned it in season five and as of season seven forgot all about it.</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is a must have for any Hardcore Ninjago collector and is very fun to play with.</p>
