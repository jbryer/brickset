The concept of ghost ninja&nbsp;was even cooler than cyborg ninja (maybe next wave will be cyborg ghost snake ninja) and the color scheme used for the bad guys drew me in. I was looking forward to the actual sets, but stumbled upon this at TRU and thought it was worth it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>One of the same style boxes almost as used for the newer bionicle&nbsp;waves, the instructions were of the typical variety. There&#39;s an advert at the end directing to the website where kids can learn Airjitzu tricks.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Pretty good parts selection in my opinion. The larger pieces involved in the launcher aren&#39;t very good MOC material unless you&#39;re really clever, but aside from those everything else is in good colors and shapes. The printed round tile and light ghostly green swords and studs&nbsp;stood out the most to me. The launcher pod and mechanism are designed very well, and seem very durable.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The lone &nbsp;minifigure is Morro, and he looks pretty cool. His print is very detailed all around, and the transparent green legs and head really make home stand out. I will definitely be assembling a small army of these ghost ninja because of how awesome looking they are</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not too complicated. Just follow the instructions. There are some good sideways building techniques that make up the handle of the launcher, and it&#39;s pretty effective.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

"Shib","2015-08-11T09:09:41.71Z","Just Another Gimmick? ","<p>Lately any action theme seems to revolve around having a gimmicky game to tie into it, Airjitzu looks to be the latest of these. These little game sets are not necessarily a bad thing, while the Chima Speedorz were generally lauded, and the Ninjago Spinjutzu sets generally seen as a lack lustre beyblade copy, both had some positives in the way of some interesting minifigures and often unique parts. How does Airjitzu compare?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The boxes for all this wave or Airjitzu flyers are done in a very similar style to the last wave of Chima Speedorz, a thing tapering card box that can be hung from promotional displays or stacked on a shelf. The artwork is very fitting for the Ninjago theme, with the typical close up of the character&#39;s eyes and an image showing the flyer dramatically spinning through the air in a cartoony whirlwind. The box also shows a full image of the minifigure (in this case the minifigure shown was what made me decide to pick up this particular set as a trial for the series) and all the weapons included, laid out nicely like a visual list.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not much of a believer in using price per part as a measure of value and this set is a great example of why - in terms of price per piece it&#39;s terrible value, until you factor in the fact that the majority of the parts included have been used in less than a dozen sets. Being able to obtain uncommon parts in a set with a relatively low price point is to me a massive plus.</p>

<p>On inspecting the box I was particularly pleased to see a telescope piece in sand green (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4649065"">part number&nbsp;4649065</a>) as this is the first appearance of this part in sand green, which in my opinion is a great colour for buildings, I was even happier when I realised that the set I picked up contained a spare of this part too.</p>

<p>The set also contains several parts in the relatively new Spring Yellow Green colour. I think a lot of people will be disappointed that these parts aren&#39;t glow in the dark as a lot of the images make them look, but the colour is useful for giving a ghostly glow look without resorting to glow in the dark plastics, which have been known to be less reliable in the past.</p>

<p>The Airjitzu&nbsp;specific parts are unsurprisingly among the most uncommon in the sets. The clear pod (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6108477"">part&nbsp;6108477</a>) I see being particularly useful for space builds, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we start seeing it used in some different colours before too long. The propeller part (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-18592"">part number 18592</a>) is a little more difficult to use as it only seems to have a connection compatible with the Airjitzu pods, but I think some clever MOCs using usual connections may start appearing around the net once people start getting hold of more of the parts to experiment with.</p>

<p>Finally, the main part of the launcher mechanism (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6110042"">part number&nbsp;6110042</a>) deservers a special mention. To my mind this part demonstrates just how much LEGO have learnt about these special game sets. Compare this part to the Chima Speedorz and the two become completely different things - the Speedorz used a special wheel part that might jet used in fan models, but for the most part are likely to head to the parts scrap piles - LEGO&#39;s own rules on &quot;legal&quot; part connection likely rendered them useless for anything but the Speedorz. The Airjitzu launcher piece however will likely be widely repurposeable. I have tried using the launcher upside down and it could hypothetically work as a spinning top launcher too. But more than this, it could have wider uses as a bridge part between technic and standard system builds. It has a definite look of being designed with more than just the single use in mind.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As with all the Airjitzu sets this set comes with one Minifigure, Morro. I am not a fan of the Ninjago cartoon, so don&#39;t have the in depth character knowledge that some might have, but this appears to be the only minifigure of Morro as himself - set&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70736-1/Attack-of-the-Morro-Dragon"">70736: Attack of the Morro Dragon&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;features the green ninja possessed by Morro, but as you&#39;d expect the two minifigures are completely different in design.</p>

<p>Overall the design of the minifigure is pretty good, it&#39;s not as ghost like as some other figures in the Ghost Army subtheme, but the greens used do work to create a certain eerie vibe. The torso has no translucent parts so could be repurposed for use on a standard non ghost ninja minifigure too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Most of the build is fairly standard, anyone who has built half a dozen sets will be familiar with the basic techniques used. This to me is the big downfall of this subtheme, the build for all the sets is essentially the same thing is different colours with some very slight variations. This might not matter to the target age range, but I look at it and the oft published stories about LEGO now lacking imagination spring to mind.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s obviously not a display piece, this is a toy to be played with. The launcher does take a bit of muscle to send it flying, but once you get the hang of the necessary force it becomes quite satisfying to see the flyer shoot up and gently decend. It&#39;s a much simpler and better game than any of the speedorz, which required a lot of complicated instruction on how to play.</p>

<p>One thing I htink is a little bit of an oversight is that there are quite a few weaons included for the minifigures, but there is absolutely nowhere on the model to put them. As the minifigure will only fit in the pod holding the shuriken it&#39;s a shame they didn&#39;t think to include some clips to hold the spare weapons.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As a game subtheme of an action theme, I think LEGO is right on the money with this idea. The game is simple, and easy to come up with your own rules, the parts are likely to be used elsewhere and the minifigure included is really nice. Definitely a strong start for the subtheme!</p>

"Lee_Fogel","2017-01-23T21:34:09.327Z","Well worth the price!","<p>I was fortunate to find this particular set on sale (closeout) at Walmart last fall for $2.96. They had a bunch of them so I picked up four, one for each member of my family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts count, while small, is smartly laid out and it has some pieces I&#39;ve not seen before. The packaging is a bit misleading though as it&nbsp;appears that the light green pieces would be &#39;glow in the dark&#39; however they do not.</p>

<p>The set builds very quickly and the minifigure, Morro, has many different weapons in this set plus a translucent green spider.&nbsp;The bummer is that there is no place to store the extra weapons and only the throwing stars can the figure have in his hands while in the clear pod.&nbsp;The figure itself looks good as the pants are translucent green as is his head.</p>

<p>The toy itself works fabulously and if you rip hard on it the spinner will achieve&nbsp;<strong>very</strong>&nbsp;high heights in the air. Another neat feature is that&#39;s it&#39;s balanced so when it lands it will spin like a top for a long time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My 7 year old son thinks it&#39;s very fun and he&#39;s used it quite a bit. It holds up to repeated use (and bumps, smacks and crashes into trees!) with no damage or breaking. At $9.99 it&#39;s a very good deal that will give hours of play time...if you find it&nbsp;as cheaply as I did snap a few up for the extras and to have one to&nbsp;play/fly&nbsp;with your child.</p>
