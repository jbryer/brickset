<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>How it works is simple. The capsul that holds the minifig&nbsp;attaches to the vortex piece with two Technic pins. There is a specialized piece to put the vortex in to the launcher. It gets held in place by the rip chord. When you pull the rip chord, the Airjitzu flys. The faster you pull out the rip chord, the higher it will go. These really work well and can go up to 15 feet high.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifig is nothing new. We got this version of Wrathe&nbsp;in other sets from the Possession line. He gets many weapons, but he can&#39;t hold them while inside the capsul.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this. It is truely hard to explain until you actually play with it. I enjoy doing tricks and other fun stunts. If you are looking for some Lego fun, buy an Airjituset, it is worth it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: if the flyer crashes against a hard edge, like the end of a table, it can chip.&nbsp;</p>

It does a great job of demonstrating the function of the play gimmick and shows off everything included with the set on the front, all of the weapons and the Minifigure. Overall a very nice design, with easier access to the contents and no possibility of injuring small fingers when tearing open the plastic bubbles.</span></span></span></span></p>

The design is pretty clever, I like the dual-sided torso print with the tattered robes and chains, the use of transparent legs for the character with printed designs is also pretty ingenious to represent a spectral entity.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The facial print is dual-sided, you&rsquo;ve got a single sided facial expression, but the head is completely wrapped in cloth hiding the features aside from his eyes. He&rsquo;s also got a brand new head piece with a purple band around a cloaked mask to further hide his spiritual nature.</span></span></span></span></p>

Two katana attached to the Airjitzu launcher, a pair of golden throwing stars, a jagged lime green spectral blade thing, a standard Castle era axe and a very painful looking flail on a long staff with a sai used for the tip and a piece of chain with twin Technic gears used for the head of the flail. Overall Wrayth is armed for all-out war.</span></span></span></span></p>

LEGO did a very impressive job of incorporating older toy designs into a LEGO form. Spinners of this sort are pretty forgettable, a rather bland play idea that work better for summer months, but here they&rsquo;re still pretty fun.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The build looks pretty nice too, it&rsquo;s a very simple build for the handle and LEGO has used them in actual sets as small tower structures, which is really a great re-use of parts. You have three basic elements, a buildable handle, the rotating lift capturing propeller piece and a small capsule to fit the Minifigure in. Overall a very nice looking design.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is a pretty decent play style element. The Airjitzu flyer works very well, provided you remember to pull the rip cord hard enough to get actual lift. It spins fairly rapidly though so being careful is a necessary precaution. The Minifigure is an added element in a cheap package to get a character you&rsquo;d like. Younger fans should really enjoy pulling the rip cords to launch them into the air and trying to knock their opponent&rsquo;s flyer out of some made up ring or playing area. The capsule piece looks extremely interesting and I&rsquo;d suggest using them as some sort of cryogenic capsules for fans of Classic Space sets and MOCing unique elements into an impressive display.</span></span></span></span></p>
