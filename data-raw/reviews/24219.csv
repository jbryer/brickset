"PooPotato","2015-07-26T23:16:50.403Z","A Sleek Vehicle From a Not-So-Sleek Movie","<p>Now, say what you will about Star Wars Episode I, but the fact remains that the designs for the vehicles and starships was on par wih the rest of the Star Wars saga. &nbsp;One of the hidden gems of this film, at least in my opinion, is the Flash Speeder. &nbsp;Given only a few seconds of screen time, it&#39;s most important role in the first film is to take out a roving AAT before The Assault on Theed to capture Nute Gunray. &nbsp;Other than that, it is for the most part never seen again, as was the case for many of the Prequel vehicles/starships. &nbsp;However, it was due for an update, as the last one was released in 2000.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is of a much higher quality than boxes in the past, and this is a very nice trend, because the chances of you picking one up with a crushed corner is very slim now. &nbsp;However the&nbsp;instruction booklet was folded in half, which we all know is a pain in the neck. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As you can probably tell, the vast majority of the pieces in this set are bright green. &nbsp;In order to capture the sleek look and curvature of the source material, there are a large amount of slope pieces included. &nbsp;MOC wise this might be useful for some sort of architecture scheme.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two of the minifigures are exclusive to this set, which is great considering that 75080 AAT came with ZERO exclusive minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Two Battle Droids&nbsp;</strong>are included with this set. &nbsp;They have kept their same old design, and they are great for armybuilding.</p>

<p><strong>Captain Tarpals&nbsp;</strong>makes his first ever appearance in this set, which is shocking because he is one of three Gungans actually given a speaking role, the others being Jar Jar and Boss Nass. &nbsp;It is understandable that a Boss Nass hasn&#39;t been created, but considering that the Gungan head mold has been around for quite a while, Tarpals was really due for a minifigure. He features purple highlights and a nicely printed battle tunic, and even comes with a spear.</p>

<p><strong>Naboo Security Guard&nbsp;</strong>makes his second appearance in this set, the other being 75058 MTT, which I have not purchased yet due to it being a Toys R&#39; Us exclusive. &nbsp;He comes with a brown torso, along with yellow arms and legs. &nbsp;His hat is of a newer design that I have never seen, and it looks absolutely awesome, with a gold strip across the middle and some sort of insignia on the front. &nbsp;He also comes with a blaster pistol. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Naboo Security Officer&nbsp;</strong>is also exclusive to this set. &nbsp;He features an updated torso and printed legs that are identical to the duds that Captain Panaka wore in Episode I. &nbsp;He also has the same goofy hat that was featured on the Panaka minifigure. &nbsp;He comes with a double printed head as well, one side worried, the other pretty angry looking. &nbsp;He&#39;s probably the best looking minifigure in this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly standard for a vehicle, but I was very impressed by how they achieved the sleek curves and angles for this speeder. &nbsp;I was very happy&nbsp;that they included four seats for minifigures as well. The construction of the flanks of the speeder was my favorite part, as they were built separately from the speeder, then connected to hinge points near the rear and secured to the front&nbsp;after hinging them down. I&#39;m not sure if this is a feature of the craft in the movie, but nonetheless it looks cool. &nbsp;&nbsp;I also never had the feeling that what I was building was going to fall off, as the design is VERY sturdy and meant for play. &nbsp;Three spring loaded blasters were included, but as per usual I put all of the ammo in a separate bag. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks awesome, especially for a $30 set. &nbsp;However, there is one very glaring issue: the turret. &nbsp;It is one of the wimpiest turrets I have ever seen, and it&#39;s shocking to think that one shot from this thing was able to take down an AAT. &nbsp;I feel like the designers already went overboard with the amount of pieces and had to construct the turret with limited resources. &nbsp;However, the only real glaring part of it is the barrel, so if you have extra pieces laying around you could easily beef up the turret and make it look more serviceable. &nbsp;I also feel that another droid, such as a Droideka could have made this a little more exciting of a playset. &nbsp;Two normal Battle Droids would be no problem for this speeder, but a Droideka might give them a run for their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>Great price</p>

<p>5 Minifigures, 2 exclusive</p>

<p>15 years since this design was last used</p>

<p>Only one Gungan :-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>Wimpy turret</p>

<p>Could use another droid</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I was very impressed with the design and build of this set, and I would recommend it to anybody who doesn&#39;t absolutely despise the Prequel Trilogy.</p>

"BVA8007","2016-02-04T09:32:29.843Z","Bigger, better, stronger","<p>If you missed out the 2000 version you&#39;ll have a second&nbsp;chance &nbsp;to&nbsp;bring the Naboo security forces and their Gungan ally Captain Tarpals into the action with the manoeuvrable&nbsp;Flash Speeder.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box &amp;&nbsp;Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box shows the Flash Speeder in action. It also has a section where all five of the minifigugers are shown. On the back&nbsp;of the box you&#39;ll get a look at all of the play features. There&#39;s also a nice animated picture of the five minifigures.</p>

<p>The box contains three numbered bags, one instruction booklet and one tiny sticker sheet.</p>

<h3>Parts &amp;&nbsp;Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set contains a lot of green parts, just like it supposed to. The other parts are black, dark - and&nbsp;light gray. There are no new or special bricks amongst them.</p>

<p>The minifigures are a different story. You&#39;ll get five of them witch contain&nbsp;two figures that are&nbsp;exclusives&nbsp;to this set. The two identical Battle Droids&nbsp;show nothing new (since 1999). We&#39;ve also seen&nbsp;the Naboo Security Guard before. Stil&nbsp;it&#39;s a quit rare figure, witch only came before within the 75058 MTT. This set realy shows off with the two exclusive minifgures:</p>

<p>- Naboo&nbsp;Security Officer (a nice printed torso with some silver details. Also the helmet is nicely done with the golden rim)</p>

<p>- Captain Tarpals (this&nbsp;high ranked&nbsp;Gungan&nbsp;warrior is very detailed and movie acurate)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build &amp;&nbsp;The completed model</h3>

<p>The build starts off with building the two Battle Droids. Luckly&nbsp;there just two of them, because after 16 years of building Battle Droids&nbsp;it gets al little annoying. After the first bag, you&#39;re done with the stickers and you&#39;ve build the base of the model and the cockpit section. The second bag contains the other three minifigures and the parts for the back section of the model. The third bag has the parts for the side panels and canons.</p>

<p>The completed model really&nbsp;captures the shape and overall look of the real Flash Speeder! Its also has the hovering effect because off the transparent bricks on the bottom.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I din&#39;t&nbsp;have high hopes for this model... But I&#39;m actualy&nbsp;very pleased after finishing the build. I think its because the model is much sleeker then expected by the pictures on the box. Although the retail price is really high (15 cents a piece) I would absolute recommend&nbsp;this set to everyone that doesn&#39;t hate Episode I.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"DutchFlyer","2019-02-03T17:44:49.833Z","A nice addition to the Star Wars speeder line-up","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This Flash Speeder is the second rendition issued by Lego, following the 2000 Flash Speeder (set 7124)&nbsp;and a 2016 foil pack. It is - by far - the best model of the Flash Speeder today. The build is nice. There are three mini-figures, and two droids; the mini-figures&nbsp;are well done. The shape of the speeder is captured well. Overall, this might be one of the better speeders Lego has produced. It offers good play value - three shooters, shwooshable, good guys and bad guys... Yet somehow, the price bugs me. Somehow it does not feel like a 30 euro set. That said, if you can get it for that price or preferably a little cheaper, it is worth picking up if you are looking for a toy that resembles a Naboo&nbsp;Flash Speeder with some nice minifigures.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build is easy: there are only two stickers, and it took me just some 40 minutes to build the speeder. There were no special building techniques used, as far as I am aware. Sole exception could be the construction of the side-walls and their attachment to the frame.&nbsp;There might be some re-coulours. The vehicle itself is - in the end - quite sturdy. Overall, as far as construction goes, a good and sturdy design.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three minifigures&nbsp;proper, and two droids included in this set. The droids are common, and nothing special.</p>

<p>The Naboo security guards is also found in the 2014 MTT (set&nbsp;75058). His uniform print is nice, and well done. He wears gloves, his single face print does look a bit angry.</p>

<p>The Naboo&nbsp;security officer is one of the unique minifigures&nbsp;in&nbsp;this set. A similarly well done print on the front and back of the torso, and nicely continues on the legs. He also wears gloves.His two face prints are OK: one gives a peeved off impression, the other an angry look.</p>

<p>The best minifigure&nbsp;in this set - IMHO - is Captain Tarpal. He seems to be the most recent minifig&nbsp;of a Gungan, as the most recent Jar Jar Binks&nbsp;dates to 2011. I like the detailed print on the torso and legs. Sadly, the print is not completely in register, which is clearly evident when looking at the belt buckle, where there is a clear brake at the transition between the torso and the legs. I like the print on his head piece.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The speeder is well designed, and generally looks like a job well done by the designer. You can see the trend towards improving the curves of the speeders, and making them studless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when comparing it to images of the original vehicle from the movies, the issues with its shape become obvious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arguably it is stocky enough, but the nose and rear of the vehicle are off. The nose should be more pointy, rather than the snub nose it is now. The &#39;wing&#39; or &#39;spoiler&#39; carrying the rotating turret and wing-shooters should be placed lower. Also, the curve at the back is completely absent.&nbsp;Even in its current form, it seems well worth while to look to upgrade the rear of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Frankly, I think that with this vehicle, the designer has run head long into the design requirements, as well as the limitations of Lego bricks. Lowering the rear turret would have interfered with the minifigures&nbsp;seated in the vehicle. Making the nose of the speeder more pointy would have been taken away from the relative smoothness of the curves. The sidewalls seem high, but lowering them would probably have compromised the structural integrity of the speeder. The two shooter-pods on the side seem oversized, but spring-loaded shooters are simply not smaller.The one area where I think he could (maybe should?)&nbsp;have done a better job is the rear of the vehicle.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set is above all a display set. Three spring-loaded shooters, it is very swooshable, two hidden compartments, three good guys, and two bad guys. There is enough out there for any kid to have fun. One can also easily come up with vehicles to oppose it.</p>

<p>As a display piece it simply falls short - unless maybe part of a bigger display. It is not big, the deficiencies in shape and the ugly rear end... they all detract from its display merits.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>To be honest, I am conflicted about the whole thing. If one merely looks at the speeder and&nbsp;ignores the original from the movie, it is IMHO one of the more attractive speeders in the whole of the Star Wars universe released to date. The one detraction is its ugly rear.</p>

<p>If one compares it to the movie original, a host of new issues emerges. I think the choices made by the designer are definitele defensible, as Lego is supposed to be a toy and played with first and foremost.</p>

<p>Looking at all of this, the price, the PPP as well as - using Jangbricks&#39; &#39;volume of stuff&#39; criterium - I am somewhat conflicted. I think the price is acceptable, as long as you are not looking at a Naboo&nbsp;Flash Speeder miniature in Lego.</p>
