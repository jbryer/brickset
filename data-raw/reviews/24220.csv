<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>Slim box with the main ship proud on display on the front cover. Back of box shows the sets main playable features. Comes with 1 instruction manual.</p>

<p><strong>Parts&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Set has a bunch of grey and &nbsp;yellow pieces. Set contains a lot of round and curved parts.</p>

<p>Weapons: 1 blue light saber, 3 blasters, 3 blaster pistols, 2 hand cuffs</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;You get a lot of good minifigs: 2 battle droids, 1 battle droid commander, 1 young Obi-Wan, 1 Anakin&nbsp;Skywalker (kid), 1&nbsp;Naboo&nbsp;Pilot, 1 R2-D2, 2 (build) Destroyer Droids.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Total build time: 1hr 30min&nbsp;- 2hrs. Very enjoyable build. The main focus is the fighter, which is symetrical&nbsp;without being tedious. Fun build.</p>

<p>The accessories are cool too. There is a rotating stand for the fight to rest on, a ladder for the pilot to climb, a power or fuel refill station, a missile cart, and a cargo box filled with blasters. Don&#39;t forget the buildable destroyer droids which are awesome.</p>

<p>Only con of building this set is there are a ton of stickers. I think there are almost 20 total!</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Complete model is almost perfect. I wish it also came a Darth Maul,&nbsp;Qui-Gon&nbsp;Jinn and maybe a Naboo&nbsp;Guard&nbsp;but, it portrays the hanger scene pretty well. Best Naboo Star Fighter by far and you get a lot of cool accessories. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This set is great. Only complaint would be too many stickers and maybe a few more minifigs.</p>

"DireStraits85","2017-01-16T22:12:25.047Z","Great Set.","<p>This is a great set for young to middle aged fans of Star Wars. It haves 3 droids and 2 destroyer droids to face off against Obi-Wan as he protects Anakin&nbsp;and saves the pilot. It is a beautiful recreation of the Naboo&nbsp;Starfighter&nbsp;and is a great display piece. It&#39;s missiles are well hidden into the ship and are fun to launch. This set is good for it&#39;s price and would recommend it.&nbsp;</p>
