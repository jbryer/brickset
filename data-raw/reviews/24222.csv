"alldarker","2015-06-05T09:31:33.733Z","A great update of a classic OT vehicle","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The image on the box is pretty nice, showing the Tyderium in flight over Endor, all&nbsp;guns blazing. To be honest, I don&#39;t think any Lambda class shuttle ever opened fire in any of the Star Wars movies they appeared in, but I digress.&nbsp;The European box lacks the parts count that the US box&nbsp;would have, and although all five figures are shown on the front of the box, they all lack the &#39;new!&#39; call-out new figures used to have in the past <em>(although four of the five figures are indeed new)</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opening the box, I&nbsp;was very pleased to see both instructions and stickers sealed within their own bag. The complete instructions are in one very&nbsp;nicely bound volume.&nbsp;The box contains 6 bags, and no loose pieces. Oddly enough, my set contained one old style printed plastic bag<em> (bag 1)</em>, and five new style printed plastic bags.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figures are all great. Han Solo is the one with the least&nbsp;lustre, and that&#39;s saying something, because as a stand alone figure he still looks great. &nbsp;Lego were sneaky by putting the updated&nbsp;Chewbacca&nbsp;figure in a non-OT set <em>(75042 Droid&nbsp;Gunship)</em> first, but finally he makes his appearance in a true OT set.&nbsp;Leia&nbsp;is just great: the poncho looks great on her, although it feels a little fragile in hand. Actually, this set contains some great figures for military builders: the poncho would look great on a sniper figure, and the two&nbsp;Endor&nbsp;rebel soldiers would look perfectly fine in any modern&nbsp;20th&nbsp;/&nbsp;21st&nbsp;century battle scene <em>(perhaps replacing their helmets with 3rd party&nbsp;millitary&nbsp;helmets)</em>. The two Ender Rebel Soldiers are in actual fact both completely new, including their helmets. They do not have the same helmets as the previous&nbsp;Endor&nbsp;Soldiers. Difference being the color of the band around the helmet: whereas the previous helmets were sand green, these are <em>(a slightly more accurate) </em>dark green.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The set took me about three hours to build, but I took my time: 1,5 to 2 hours should easily be attainable.&nbsp;The set contains plenty of white parts, including a mass of 1x1 bricks with hole.&nbsp;The build is pleasant&nbsp;with a mix of technic constructions and regular building techniques. Standout parts of the build to me were building up&nbsp;the dorsal wing and the cockpit. The set contains 5 stickers, all relatively&nbsp;small and easily placed, but none truly essential for the look of the craft.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>End product looks great. Points of&nbsp;criticism&nbsp;are that the the nose is a little too long and doesn&#39;t point downwards enough, that the ramp is in the wrong place and that the landing gear is a little messy <em>(but gets the job done)</em>. Having built the previous <em>(7166 and 7264)</em> versions of the Lambda Class shuttle, and always having enjoyed them for what they were, the difference between those two previous versions <em>(I believe they are practically identical)</em> and this new version is still pretty mind-boggling. I never bought the 10212 UCS Shuttle, so I can&#39;t compare them, but personally, I feel the scale of the much smaller 75094 Shuttle just looks a little more pleasing, even if the huge UCS is the more &#39;minifig&nbsp;scaled&#39; version.</p>

<p>The play&nbsp;functions are a lot better than all previous version, including the UCS. First of all, this craft is as solid as a rock, making it very playable <em>(and swooshable!)</em>. Secondly, a lot of attention has finally been paid to the interior of the craft. Seats, cargo, a display of Endor,&nbsp;a cockpit&nbsp;which seats two, and space&nbsp;to transport about six / seven figures all make the interior almost as interesting as just the outside form of the shuttle.&nbsp;and on the outside, we have the ugly, but functional landing gear, the ramp, and the articulated guns. Of special note are&nbsp;also the spring-fired missile launchers, which are incorporated&nbsp;into the build in such a perfect&nbsp;way that they are almost completely hidden, but still very functional due to a &#39;hidden button&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Along with 76035&nbsp;Jokerland, this was definitely the Summer 2015 set I was looking forward to most, closely followed by 75093 Death Star Final Duel. With this set being relatively new, and not yet having seen or read too many reviews, my expectations were pretty high for this set. And luckily,&nbsp;I was not disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lambda Class Imperial Shuttle was&nbsp;most definitely a craft which deserved a significant system scale update, and&nbsp;I believe Lego succeeded&nbsp;perfectly in doing this with the 75094 Tyderium. This version is just an all-round great set, in look, build, figures and in playability. Only thing where it falls slightly flat is <em>(European)</em>&nbsp;RRP, but that&#39;s something which counts against&nbsp;most licensed Lego sets, and nowadays&nbsp;finding discounts on new Lego sets is very easy. I managed to get a 15% discount on the Dutch RRP&nbsp;of &euro;109,95, which&nbsp;put&nbsp;this&nbsp;set&nbsp;exactly at the &euro;0,10 per part&nbsp;for me: at that price it&#39;s very&nbsp;reasonable value for a licensed set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My overall rating for the 75094 Imperial&nbsp;Shuttle Tyderium: a well deserved&nbsp;5/5! My next challenge to Lego:&nbsp;an equally goodlooking&nbsp;update to that 7659 Imperial Landing Craft!</p>

"Evil_Pixie_Works","2015-06-07T03:57:39.823Z","About time for an affordable Imperial Shuttle!","<p>I always love lager builds, unfortunately I cant afford the mega-kits.&nbsp; Sitting down with this bloke, for 5 hours.&nbsp; Its sure not the biggest build I&#39;ve done, but it was well designed and easy to follow if you have experience.&nbsp; The finished product feels solid and strong and I hope to have it on display for years to come.&nbsp; It sure beats the days before numbered bags!&nbsp; There were 6 of them in this kit and with little doors and tricks, again... well built to the designer.</p>

<p>I only see 2 small &ldquo;extra&rdquo; issues... to the fact 3 key minifigures should have been included in this kit along with a stand.&nbsp; Or at least, it would be nice to figure out a build to do our own.&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I always enjoy a larger single book, so it stays open in your hand rather then smaller books that are unstable... as I&#39;ve always been a 1-handed builder.&nbsp; One for the build, one for the book.&nbsp; So I liked that about this kit.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As it is the design of this spacecraft, and done in the 80&#39;s, you could say the&nbsp;COLOR is a little bland, but I have no issues with any&nbsp;of the parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">To tell the truth, regardless of the build... the ship is just so amazingly beautiful and has always been a favorite. Since the day I saw Jedi for the first time. Lego made that really high end version, however I wasn&#39;t connected to Lego at the time OR I would have found/saved the money and got a kit when they were still on the shelf. So when this one broke in the news, I was super excited and couldn&#39;t wait to get my hot little pixie hands on it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">Also, from seeing the kit in the news, I wasn&#39;t all that interested in the minifigures... however I do love minifigures. Something the super fancy line doesn&#39;t really come with, for all that money, more then 1 minifigure toilet at best. I could only see or guess it would be Chewy and Han... then Leia. I couldn&#39;t tell it had to basic Rebel troopers. When the ship went on sale, I must have been in the first 1000 people to buy it because we are talking seconds and refreshing the screen at midnight June 1. However it wasn&#39;t until the next day I received the new catalog in the post and saw, up close, that this set has no Endor Luke. No Luke! How big was the speeder-bike chase in Jedi? 1983, it wowed everyone... and Luke, himself, said he was endangering everyone by going on the mission to that moon. Lego decided, for this 100$ kit, to ignore a key player... to have a Leia without Luke. Its bad enough they failed to include the droids! That I already knew from seeing the kit on day one... you can find the droids easy enough, other places... but Lego&#39;s last Endor Moon Luke was in yellow skin... and these minifigures are BEAUTIFUL! Lego has really been topping themselves with print quality this last year or so.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in"">Its a BIG kit! Its a worth wild kit. I&#39;m the last one to volunteer to pay more money for a Lego kit. They make enough profit... but I would pay 10$ more for the 3 missing minifigures. This kit feels absent without them. Never mind the ship! The ship is just amazing. Also, within that 10$ more, a stand for flying mode? That would be nice to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This pixie loves it!&nbsp; I&#39;d easily buy it again if I had to do it all over again.&nbsp; Ahead, I look to design and build the stand for flying mode... and collecting the droids... and building a proper Luke.&nbsp; SO, I kind of have to say... 5 hours work... I feel like the job isn&#39;t exactly done.&nbsp; It will take months to finish and as I said, years of enjoyment.&nbsp; So no biggy.</p>

"Sobel","2016-03-13T15:15:49.53Z","My biggest SW Set so far!","<p>Despite the fact, that I&#39;m always short on money, this set caught my attention instantly! I simply had to get together my last money to buy it. I got it for 80&euro;, which I found to be quite a good deal, since the average store price is about 95-100&euro;. Like all the SW models, it is still a little overpriced, in my opinion.<br />
I knew the old model (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7166-1/Imperial-Shuttle"">7166</a>) and I have to say, it has made some REAL progress!!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As always, a nice, robust boxing with lots of information on it. The backside shows all the features of the shuttle, without stealing the fun of experiencing it yourself.<br />
The Instructions booklet is quite handy, and has an even more &quot;book&quot;-feeling to it, less &quot;-let&quot;! ;-) As in all modern instructions, it is packed with additional Information, e.g. ads for SW Rebels, other sets and the minifigures. Some pages are not really used very good, only one part is shown on a half page...??? But OK.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set features a nice variety of standard bricks, &quot;special&quot; parts (blasters, wings, engines, etc.) and technic parts. There are 937 parts overall, so you could also use them to build something completely new! The color pattern is simple (white and grey), but that&#39;s absolutely OK, &#39;cause, you know, authenticity and stuff...!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with five minifigures: Han, Chewy, Leia and two rebel troopers. I like the design of Chewbacca and Leia. The rebel troopers are also nicely designed. Han&#39;s face is very simple, but I guess it is difficult to add special details to it! His &quot;clothes&quot; look really cool!<br />
They all have a blaster/bowcaster, Leia wears a camouflage-suit made of cloth.<br />
Little con here: this thing is predestined to rip apart, I&#39;m sure!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build takes a while, even though not being overly challenging. It&#39;s the mass of parts and the identity of the colors which makes it take a little longer here and there.<br />
The build starts with some additional gear, and then the shuttle is build from the bottom up. The build follows several separate steps which are then assembled, as soon as one is finished. Every single of these steps is interesting and not the least repetitive. There aren&#39;t many stickers, which I personally appreciate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Awesome! This word describes the finished model in all its glory!<br />
It is very sturdy and a real eye-catcher! It perfectly depicts the famous ship from Episode VI, which is one of the most famous of the whole franchise, I think!<br />
There are some gaps where moveable parts are attached at the back part, but that is not avoidable, I guess.<br />
The wings move nicely, the two shooters are perfectly integrated and even have a &quot;trigger-button&quot;! The ship lands on two big landing-feet which are in good balance, so it doesn&#39;t shake when standing. When the wings unfold, this baby gets REALLY huge! It spans up to some 44 cm in width and about 40 cm in height! I think a kid could hav a hard time holding this ship! The cockpit has room for two (Chewie and Han) and their equipment. There is no passage to the back from the cockpit, so it opens up completely to put the minifigures is. The back part has two openable hatches where you can put in Leia and the troopers. There are also two spots, where you can clip the additional shooter &quot;arrows&quot; to, so they won&#39;t get lost! I also like the rear view on the model with the big engine openings, that seem to glow in blue!<br />
Only little con: The minifigs in the back are quite fiddly to put in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m completely exalted! This set has everything, a model of the Tydrium needs! For less than 100&euro; (which is still a lot!!!) you get a huge starship and some famous minifigures. The shuttle features all the functions it should, making it my absolute favorite SW set so far! If you&#39;re a fan on LEGO Star Wars, this is a MUST. If you&#39;re not, this is still a cool addition to your LEGO collection!</p>

"jimjim66","2016-01-03T20:05:17.267Z","Imperial Shuttle Tydirium","<p>Iconic stolen Imperial Shuttle the rebels use in Return of the Jedi.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>Standard box with the action shots on the back. Shows the set well. Instructions are well presented and in a 158 pg booklet. Lovely page towards the back that shows all the minifigures from the same wave of sets. Also in the front a page dedicated to the Star Wars rebels characters. Shame this was not a poster in its own right.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>At 937 pieces this is by no means a small set. They come in 6 numbered bags. There is a good variety of technic pieces included. Of course the bulk of the pieces are white, with grey included. Only a couple of stickers included no complaints from me, I&#39;m not a fan of stickers but as always they add to the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>5 figures included, all rebels. Han, Liea, Chewie and 2 Rebel soilders. The 2 rebel solider are different, One is green based the other greyish based. Similar leg prints. One has a bearded face. Chewie comes&nbsp;with bowcaster. Han looks great and torso matches down to legs to look like his long coat from the film. Liea comes with a poncho and grey bottoms. Blasters&nbsp;and not stud shooters for the figures. Apart from Chewie I believe the rest are all new.</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>Really interesting build. I&#39;m not one to look through the instructions before I start so it was interesting to see how the shuttle would take shape. You start by&nbsp;building some accessories, then move on to the shuttle, main body first, dorsal fin, wings and cockpit. build is good to follow. It&#39;s not repetitive even with the wings.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>Once complete, you have space for 2 figures in the cockpit and 3 in the main hold. Set is strong which allows for playability. Model comes with 2 spring shooters, i don&#39;t remember seeing a shuttle fire in the films but can&#39;t imagine them being unarmed, the shooters are built into the shuttle so you don&#39;t have to keep them loaded.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I believe there are iconic sets for all Lego Star Wars fans, X-Wing, Star Destroyer, &nbsp;Slave 1 and the Falcon. I&#39;d put this set in that category. It looks great. Represents from the film well.The shuttle plays a pivotal part in Return of the Jedi, I&#39;m really happy I&#39;ve got this set. Perhaps the inclusion of Luke Skywalker or some imperial troops would&#39;ve of completed the set, but I can&#39;t complain. Great set would recommend to anyone.</p>

"Hugh_s_Brix","2016-05-29T01:09:19.897Z","Shuttle Tydirium","<p>I love this set. Its great in so many ways.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The&nbsp;box of this set is really big. The box is very square like rather than the normal rectangle shape and this box is very thick.&nbsp;It shows the shuttle flying over Endor, with some explosions in the background. You can see the second Death Star behind the shuttle.It has the 2015 Stormtrooper logo in the top right corner. On the back of the box it shows us some of the play features the set has and some nice comic style pictures on the right side.</p>

<p>There is one instruction manual to the set an it is quite thick.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>There are 937 parts to this set, and they are divided into 6 bags.&nbsp;The parts to this set are great. The value of price per part is good. There are not too many stickers to the set, 5 in total. I like the inclusion of thermal detonators but i&#39;m not quite sure why they have an orange piece on the bottom of it.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigures of this set are great and highly detailed. The set contains 5 minifigures. They are Princess Leia, Chewbacca, Han Solo and two rebel troopers with different prints.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Princess Leia&nbsp;has bluish grey legs, a belt and a &nbsp;jacket printing for a torso with a pale yellow texture for the arms. The print continues over to the back, where she has a belt.&nbsp;Her face has two expressions, one with a smirk and the other with an angry face. Her hair piece has been seen before and it is a dark brown hair piece with a hole in the top. To Finish her off, she has a camo poncho to go over the top of har torso, and she is equipped with a blaster pistol and the food she feeds to Wicket. (That is a cool addition)</li>
	<li>Chewbacca is the same as in the droid gunship set. His legs have some detailing for fur and his torso is left blank in a dark brown colour. This is okay because he has a head and torso piece with an amo belt detailing and more detailing for a face with some lighter colour fur on it. The amo belt continues onto the back. He is equipped with his bowcaster.</li>
	<li>Han solo is an amazing figure in this set. His legs are dark brown with an olive green coat continued onto the legs. His torso shows his black and white cloths with his olive green jacket over the top. The jacket is continued onto the back with some small detailing. He has two expressions, one with a slightly concerned face, and the other with a smirk/smile. His hair piece is the same as it has always&nbsp;been. Han is equipped with a blaster pistol.</li>
	<li>The Endor reblel troopers are my favorite minifigures in this set. They both have the same olive green legs with some pocket detailing on them. The first ones torso is bluish grey with a dark tan jacket over the top. The second figure has an olive green jacket whick blends perfectly into the legs. Their prints continue onto the back where they have some small detailing. Also the belts are split in half between the legs and the torso. (Awesome.) Neither of these figures have alternate faces although they are still detailed well. Im not quite sure what is going on with the first one. It looks like he has some facial hair covering his mouth. the second one has an ordinary looking face, nothing too special to it. The cas look really good. They are dark tan with a green stripe. They are both equipped with a standed&nbsp;blaster.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the minifigures are great in this set. What I wish The set had was an Endor camo Luke. Im pretty sure we only got one of them in an old set. 1999 or something.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The built to the set was average, it wasn&#39;t too interesting. The main pointy thing on the top of the ship (I don&#39;t know what its called) is made so well. It is so strong. When I heard people say this I beleived them but I never knew it would be this strong. If I wobble it by the pointy thing It will not break, and I even feel confided picking it up from the pointy thing. (Note do not hold at the top as the point thing will break. Hold from the middle instead.)</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The completed mode looks great. The cockpit has space for two minifigure, three if you cram&nbsp;them in. The troop area is well detailed with a nice access to the interior. I would have liked it if you could access the interior better but that might detract from the stability of he set. The wings have a cool feature to them to move down. It would be so cool if they could move together. There are two spring loaded shooters to the set. As much as I hate these shooters, they are hidden so well in this set that I actually like them. You get 4 shots in total with storage space ror two in the troop area.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>Such a great set. Its so hard to point out floors in a great set and so far I cant find any major floors. I just with we got an Endor camo Luke.</p>

"hlwarrior","2016-05-04T14:59:24.423Z","Exciting set to start on the Star Wars road in LEGO","<p>In China LEGO Star Wars&nbsp;forum, one common word&nbsp;always talked by some senior collectors is:&quot; Always wait and buy UCS, LEGO will provide every space shuttle/ship UCS version eventually.&quot; And in fact I choose 75094 instead of 10212 not only 10212 is deadly expensive and hard to find, but also limitation of space in my cabinet.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Comparing with other sets with similar bricks, The box of 75093 is nearly square while other old sets are rectangle. The box is not large, about&nbsp;half of 75055(Imperial Star Destroyer).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not like other sets of LEGO Star Wars, briefly&nbsp;large amount of the parts is in white. You could not imagine that after you finished&nbsp;Imperial Star Destroyer and AT-AT, when you see these white parts. You are excited and even want to finish it right now.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>5 person, like other reviews say. I&#39;m a little disappointed that there is no Darth Vader and Luke. This is understandable that it need to has some difference with 10212.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not hard to build it. About 2 hours done. The duplicate parts are not a lot so it&#39;s enjoyable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Actually I don&#39;t want but still need to compare, in detail comparing, 75093 is not in the same level with 10212 who is the UCS and the most strength is in detail. In my opinion, the biggest strength in 75093 is&nbsp;playability! Smart design makes the model true to reality. Expandable wings/Gear down/Open the door/Fire in the hole. It only has less than 1000 bricks.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I can not understand why LEGO do not import this set to China(The price&nbsp;list of LEGO in China is very higher than other country).&nbsp;China local dealers resell this set from other country and mark it higher than 200 USD which make me dead firstly. In the end, we find our own way to buy it directly in Amazon US or Europe.</p>

<p>I think this set is perfect to a very large number of players in China. Most of them know Star Wars just from the force awakens. They download EP1-EP6&nbsp;to their PC&nbsp;and start to love Star Wars. The price of this set is acceptable, playability is high, so as my title says it is an&nbsp;exciting set to start on the Star Wars road in LEGO.</p>

<p>p.s. The price of several Star Wars sets doubled even tripled in last one year in China......</p>

Please bear that in mind because I am going to say some serious things about this model.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Large box, sturdy, it made it OK after overseas shipment, I didn&#39;t touch the instruction booklet as I got used to&nbsp;pdf instructions on a tablet. Instructions are clear enough for a straightforward build except for the feet design I comment on down below.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I was unsure of this set since it has so many white pieces but it does provide a great mixture of technic and standard pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Lovely minifigs, nice paint and represent the scene well enough, for some reason I don&#39;t like the new chewbacca&nbsp;as much as the classic /&nbsp;unpainted one.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Okay folks this is my first review ever and the build section of this set is the whole reason why I am here today. In my humble opinion, the design of this set is just superb in so many aspects.</p>

<p>First of all it is amazingly strong.</p>

<p>Second,&nbsp;It is incredibly accurate considering the piece count, with the exception of the cockpit, but the designers balanced towards playability there and I appreciate that.&nbsp;I must admit that there is some serious engineering behind the&nbsp;design of this vessel, and being an engineer myself, it deserves all my respect.</p>

<p>I saved the best for last:&nbsp;I do feel this is the most exciting build I&nbsp;have ever gone through. The way everything comes together is very engaging and entertaining from the first to the last piece. It is beautiful at the same time.</p>

<p>Every major section of this model&nbsp;is worked&nbsp;individually and then assembled in a clever way. I was WOWed several times during this build, and by the end I was inevitably in love with the design. I would have never anticipated that such a monochrome&nbsp;model was going to be so much fun to build.&nbsp;Hats-off to the designers: outstanding.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I can&#39;t stop looking at this ship every day (yes, it made it as a permanent ornament in my home office). I play every once in a while with it, and I would say it&#39;s the only ship on my fleet that gets to be played with. It&#39;s like a magnet to humans.</p>

<p>Everything that should move moves: wings, door, cockpit, side doors, landing gear. No matter what angle you look at it from, no matter if it is in flight or landing mode, it&#39;s just beautiful and accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>** One piece from the cannon was missing, LEGO promptly replaced the part&nbsp;with an apology letter, so no worries there.</p>

<p>**There is one small detail I felt it could be improved: It seems to me that the landing feet are placed in the wrong position against the landing arms both&nbsp;in the manual and also in every photo I&#39;ve seen.&nbsp;I made my own design choice and snapped both feet at the very edge of the L-shaped landing arm as opposed to what the instructions state. As a result, both feet retract deeper into the ship and also provide better balance when the ship lands on them. I like to think the designers did that on purpose only to provide an even better building experience.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am so glad I went for this model,&nbsp;the highlight within my collection.&nbsp;If you are on the fence with this set, grab your money and get it. That&#39;s my overall opinion.</p>

<p>The booklet is quiet big (158 pages), as you can expect for a 900+ pieces set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With no surprise, most parts are white and light grey. There are a lot of Technic pieces (mostly pins) to build the wings mecanism, to maintain the vertical wing, and to set the cockpit. The ship comes with a yellow creates with thermal detonators, a backpack, two blaster rifles, two blaster pistols, one crossbow, and one cookie !</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>[img]http://i35.servimg.com/u/f35/15/86/98/65/tydiri18.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>The paradox of the set is that this imperial shuttle comes with rebels minifigures. Of course, this makes sense in the way the set represents a scene from RotJ, where the heroes use a stolen shuttle to land on Endor. Although I&#39;m collecting imperial forces, I think the minifigures choice is interesting : three of them are main characters (Han Solo and Princess Leia with Endor Outfit, and Chewbacca), and the two others are exclusive rebels soldiers. I don&#39;t like the one with a strange smile (it supposed to be beard, but its color is almost the same as the skin, it&#39;s confusing), but the printing of every minifigure is highly detailed.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>[img]http://i35.servimg.com/u/f35/15/86/98/65/tydiri17.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>It took me almost three hours to build the ship. It uses a lot of interesting technics, such as the way the panels are connected to the vertical wing. The cockpit uses the SNOT technic to recreates the distinctive imperial shuttle &quot;face&quot; in a very clever way. Even if there are a lot a white pieces, It&#39;s not a hard set to build and the instructions are really clear.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set recreates perfectly the Tydirium shuttle. There are room for two minifigures in the cockpit, instead of four in the movie, but it&#39;s enough in my opinion.</p>

<p>I see only one problem : the short landing gears. It has two positions, but there is almost no difference when you lay the ship with the lading gears folded or unfolded. The consequence is you won&#39;t see the iconic ramp when opened (and this ramp takes a lot of space in the ship, so I&#39;m considering to let it closed and add two or three seats on it). And you can&#39;t compeletly unfold the wings when the ship is on its landing gears.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>One of the best Star Wars set I got so far. It will please Star Wars fans as it&#39;s an accurate representation of an iconic ship of the Empire, but it also as a good play value with the minifigures, the moving wings and moving panels.</p>

"Areedman2000","2017-10-25T15:43:06.913Z","Imperial Shuttle Tydirium","<p>This is a really nice looking Star Wars lego set from the original trilogy.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have the UCS Emperor&#39;s Shuttle set nor have i seen it up close to compare. Can&#39;t afford to get it due to it&#39;s huge pricetag on ebay and other sites, so i settled on this for now. Have to admit, i am pleased with it. After completing this set i have it displayed&nbsp; with it in flight mode on a stand and it looks great.&nbsp; With most of the Star Wars sets, i have found one thing in common... The bigger the better. At least that&#39;s my opinion.&nbsp; While this set is (From what i can tell) nowhere near the size of the UCS set... it is a pretty decent size and displays nicely.&nbsp; Very clean, sturdy, and movie accurate.&nbsp; For the price (right at $100)... You can&#39;t beat it.</p>

<p>I like the minifigs that come&nbsp;with this set. Tho, i could have lived without the dumb little cookie thing that comes with Leia.&nbsp; But thats just nitpicking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most of my reviews aren&#39;t going to be very helpful when describing the build and what i did or didnt like about certain aspects. I just enjoy spending the time doing it and being able to display the finished product with the rest of my Star Wars collection.&nbsp; If i spend $100 dollars on a lego set, i expect to be occupied with the build for at least half a day. And as expected this build took me around 4 hours i&#39;d say, so i am happy with that.</p>

<p>The only tip i can offer is this. If you are the type to display your sets... You&#39;re going to want to display this one in flight mode. You won&#39;t be dissapointed.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-27T18:42:34.98Z","""We've stolen a small Imperial shuttle...""","<p>I&#39;m a long time fan of the Galactic Empire, Return of the Jedi is my favourite Star Wars film, and I love Lego, so getting hold of the Imperial shuttle was a must for me! For a long time it was the centrepiece of my Lego Star Wars collection, but the UCS Star Destroyer has claimed that spot for the forseeable future.<br />
<br />
As far as builds go it&#39;s very in-depth and detailed, with 6 numbered bags which otook me, as an adult, roughly 3 hours to build.&nbsp;If bought for children on the younger end of the age range (or even younger still!) then adult assistance will probably be required in a couple of places. That being said, it&#39;s an extremely rewarding build, and it feels fantastic when you first start attaching the fin and wings, bringing that iconic shape together.<br />
There&#39;s a relatively small amount of repetition in the build, which will please the younger crowd - the only mirror builds are the two wings, both of which are surprisingly basic and quick to assemble. For the size of the set there&#39;s also a surprisingly low sticker count of half a dozen, most of which are part of the interior detailing.<br />
The shuttle&#39;s a very sturdy model once assembled. I have to admit I was worried about the top fin being a little fragile as it&#39;s a tall and thin structure, but it&#39;s pinned in several places, and the entire thing holds together well.<br />
<br />
As far as playtime goes, the model has a lot going on. The cockpit opens up, as do the side hatches, giving enough room to house all 5 minifigures plus a couple of supply crates and spare missiles. The missiles themselves are fired from a clever little push-button mechanism on each hinge. The shuttle&#39;s multiple lasers can all be moved, the landing gear lowers and then folds back into the base of the ship, and then of course the wings fold up and down for either flight or landing mode. There&#39;s enough to keep a grown man entertained, so it should certainly be enough to keep younger minds happy!</p>

<p>The only real downside is that it would have been nice to include some way to display the shuttle with the wings folded out in flight position, but this can be rectified by diving into a spare bricks box and getting creative, or picking up one of the many acrylic stands available on eBay.<br />
<br />
The minifigure selection is very nice. You get Han Solo and Princess Leia, both of which have reversible heads with different expressions. Of course Han wouldn&#39;t be ready for action without Chewbacca, and then there are a pair of generic Rebel troopers to back up our intrepid heroes! On a personal note I would have liked the inclusion of Luke Skywalker, and maybe even an Imperial Scout Trooper, but I certainly can&#39;t complain at the group provided!<br />
<br />
All in all, it&#39;s a good lengthy build, a very detailed and stunning looking model, and a great selection of minifigures. Fantastic set.</p>
