"xboxtravis7992","2015-09-05T03:18:11.98Z","Space Tractor? or Space Warrior?","<p>Rey&#39;s Speeder is the cheapest of the Star Wars 7 sets, thus being the most readily accessible for tight budget fans. Since the source material is still two months away until release, can this Speeder stand on its own before the movie comes out?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t care much for boxes. This one had those tab openers which many AFOLs despise, but not that important for me since this will end up in the landfill anyway...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions were any easy read. Despite the Speeder&#39;s small size, it came in two numbered polybogs.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of dark red Curve parts, and the R5 astromech dome in light grey. There are&nbsp;some ski like dark grey wing piece included too. A stud shooter in dark red is also included.&nbsp;Several stickers are applied.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The thug looks generic, once the movie comes out we will know his purpose. He has some cool robot style head print.He is only armed with a crowbar, yet the&nbsp;spare pieces in the set can be combined to give him a blaster.</p>

<p>Rey looks good. Those who wish that leading females where in cheaper sets will be happy with this one. Her face is double sided with a frown and a half smile. She has very subtle freckles too. Her hood and hair pieces are new too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Lots of SNOT on such a small model, very surprising. A simple play feature is included to slightly open the doors, simple but effective.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is one tall Speeder! Seeing how tall it is one wonders what type of engine is under the hood... The opening side doors are a nice feature. The &quot;port&quot; side is different from the &quot;starboard&quot; side and provides a small tool rack.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a good model, but $20 is pushing the price a bit. I like the Speeder,&nbsp;but I question what purpose this serves until we see the movie... I give this an average three stars, good design: poor price.</p>

"The_BrickKeeper","2015-09-05T15:02:01.13Z","The Next Landspeeder?","<p>So, Force Friday was yesterday (at the time of this review), and I had no choice but to hit a store and buy something Star Wars related. Being a broke college student and finding all the other LEGO sets highly over-priced, I settled for this set. It was reasonable, and hey, who doesn&#39;t want a flying popsicle to play with?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is typical Star Wars fare. Kylo Ren replacing Darth Vader or Yoda on the upper section, an action shot plastered over the front of the box. The back is the same as every LEGO box: details and play features are shown. The instructions were similar. No image imposed behind the set, and there are pictures of all the minifigures, as well as an ad for the X-Wing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Now, the parts were cool. This set first off has some amazing dark red elements, some that I&#39;m pretty sure don&#39;t come in the dark red scheme. Beyond that, there weren&#39;t any &quot;cool&quot; elements, though there were some side-building pieces and a few pieces I had not had prior to the set, which was nice. Remember that this is an element heavy ship/speeder/frozen treat, so there are some nice greebling pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s start this with the Unkar Thug. This guy is basically a Tusken Raider...but he&#39;s still cool. Dark Gray hood element, and this really cool dark metallic robot-like head. It&#39;s something you&#39;d see in a steampunk build, honestly. His torso and legs are weird, but look cool. He appears to be wearing a desert&nbsp;camouflaged vest, and this weird shiny shirt. It has silver hexagonal things on it. Weird, but pretty cool looking in person.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now Rey is apparently a pretty important role in this film (sarcasm alert). As I&#39;m sure many others after me will say, she is an extremely accurate minifugre. Her hair and face are very close to what I can find. The face itself is double sided, providing a slight smile, and a scowl. Rey is a great instance of LEGO not overdoing the printing on facial features, and it working so, so well. All that is needed are the slightest of freckles, and that&#39;s all that&#39;s there. Her torso/legs also seem to be accurate, with an almost Elven&nbsp;dark green and sand blue palette.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about twenty minutes in a car, so it&#39;s not very long. LEGO decided to include numbers on the two packages, but it wasn&#39;t too annoying. The first box built the Thug and the skeleton of the speeder, and the second had Rey and all the red pieces. It was simple, though at times tried to be confusing (it kept switching back and forth from side to side without reason). One thing to note, because I rarely if ever see it, is the use of five studs on the front of the model. Yes, LEGO used an odd number of studs on a build. Color me impressed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is pretty big, actually, but it should be...it&#39;s a twenty buck set! It&#39;s as long as the most recent Snowspeeder, and at least as tall. One of the engines twists to open the side panels, revealing storage space. The new launchers are on the sides, allowing for some sort of play (does anyone really use those things?)...and there are plenty of connectors for equipment storage.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really liked this set. I felt like it will be the next landspeeder, and figured &quot;Why not?&quot;. In looking at images of the movie&#39;s popsicle, I did notice some issues. One, the set is probably twice as big as it should be (go figure). Second, the ship seems to be more orange than LEGO made it. However, the color it appears to be doesn&#39;t exist in the current palette. Finally, it&#39;s a lot smoother. No guns, no things on the side for parts storage, no studs. In an attempt to add &quot;equipment&quot;, LEGO messed up an entire side of this speeder. Thing is, this is an extremely easy set to mod to make it more accurate...well, minus the size. Overall, this is a decent set, with good play features, and some awesome parts. I suppose my opinion of this set will be determined by how memorable it will be this December.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Gosh I have not written&nbsp;in English&nbsp;for&nbsp;a long time, so this review may contain some&nbsp;errors, please forgive me!)</p>

<p>The LEGO&nbsp;Group have a new policy about boxes, they&#39;re smaller and less deep. The instruction manual is the right size to fit in the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not a MOC builder but I think that all these&nbsp;dark red pieces and rare&nbsp;parts I&#39;ve never seen before, such as the flaps&nbsp;towards&nbsp;the back of the vehicle, could&nbsp;be very useful!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>REY: nice minifig, head with little cute freckles. nice printed head, torso and legs.</p>

<p>THUG: he&#39;s not a main character but the minifig is really nicely done, with excellent printing all over</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re a slow builder like me (I want to enjoy the construction) it will take about&nbsp;half an hour. I really enjoyed this build as&nbsp;it uses some SNOT techniques to create an incredibly sturdy but detailed model!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Perfect. Maybe a little oversized compared to &quot;the real&quot; vehicle from&nbsp;the movie but I really like it as it is highly detailed.&nbsp;It&#39;s perfect not only for display but also for play because&nbsp;it&#39;s very sturdy and has some cool features including the shooters, the opening hatches&nbsp;and a lot of tools ready to be used by the minifigs!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a must have. If you&#39;re a child, a teen, an&nbsp;adult fan of LEGO or a general fan of Star Wars you will like this set.</p>

"PooPotato","2015-09-06T01:27:03.583Z","And It Starts With a Bang!","<p>As a very big Star Wars fan (look at all of my reviews and you&#39;ll understand), I was VERY excited for Force Friday. &nbsp;It has been 10 years since the last Star Wars film came out (The Clone Wars is a different discussion for a different day), and I vividly remember&nbsp;purchasing the Revenge of the Sith sets, which for the most part started my Lego Star Wars collection. Fast forward 10 years later,and I&#39;m jumping up and down in my living room like a little kid again after the first trailer for The Force Awakens comes out. &nbsp;The speeder that Rey pilots in the first trailer really stood out to me as something that came straight out of the Original Trilogy. &nbsp;Honestly, if Rey wasn&#39;t piloting it, It could have been Luke riding it in Episode IV instead of the famous Landspeeder. &nbsp;Other than liking the design a lot, this was the cheapest Force Awakens set that they had, so it was a no-brainer for me to purchase it anyway.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Now that the rant is over, let&#39;s get started! &nbsp;The box was of an average size, typical for this size of set. &nbsp;The instruction booklet was phenomenally flat, and I don&#39;t think I have ever seen one&nbsp;that flat before. &nbsp;I am very impressed with Lego&#39;s new packaging system, and let&#39;s hope they keep it this way. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get a rather large and attractive selection of Dark Red pieces with this set. &nbsp;This is great for part scavengers especially, as I do know that Dark Red tends to be a trickier color to stock up on. &nbsp;There were a couple of parts that I had never seen before, such as the crowbar piece and the two fins on the back, which I believe are new because I can&#39;t find them in the database.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with two minifigures, and luckily they don&#39;t spoil too much to the story. &nbsp;I feel like the past 4 months have been a constant struggle against spoilers, so this is definitely a good thing.</p>

<p><strong>Unkar&#39;s Thug&nbsp;</strong>is the first minifigure that you build, and since I have not looked too far into it, I have no idea what &nbsp;his purpose/role is in the story. &nbsp;He looks like the cross between a Jawa, a mummy, and a Tusken Raider to be honest, and considering that he carries a crowbar I am going to assume that he is a scavenger of some sort. &nbsp;He is also exclusive to this set.</p>

<p><strong>Rey&nbsp;</strong>is the other minifigure that is included, and she is far more interesting than Unkar&#39;s Thug. &nbsp;Her torso/legs are printed with very Tatooine-esqu garb, and she even has a knapsack, which I haven&#39;t seen since I collected the Indiana Jones sets. &nbsp;She comes with a helmet/head cover thing that slightlyresembles that of the Tusken Raider, and a hairpiece that is a pretty complex ponytail. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know much about Rey either, although she is almost definitely the female lead. &nbsp;I was assuming she would be the Jedi, as female Jedi were largely ignored in the saga.&nbsp;But&nbsp;according to a new movie poster, Finn, the black stormtrooper that everybody was really bothered about for some bizarre reason, appears to be the Jedi. &nbsp;She comes with some sort of staff thing, a blaster, a buzzsaw, and a blaster pistol which all are able to clip onto her speeder. &nbsp;She is also available in 75105 Millenium Falcon, although I think purchasing this set might be your better option to obtain her. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I was very curious as to how Lego was going to pull off such a unique design without compromising accuracy and play functions. &nbsp;The first half of the build is the frame of the large motor section and the cockpit/exhaust portion. &nbsp;There weren&#39;t any techniques that really surprised me, at least not until the second half. &nbsp;The SNOTting was all done in the second half, along with the construction of the sides of the speeder. &nbsp;There are two clicker stud shooter things, which I have no problem leaving loaded unlike their pesky spring loaded cousins. One feature that puzzled me at first while building was a long technic axle that runs through the middle interior of the speeder, out the back, and connects&nbsp;to the bottom exhaust port. &nbsp;There is a Comb Wheel element on this axle, and when you twist the bottom&nbsp;exhaust port left and right, it pushes the side panels of the speeder out so you can access the supply crate. &nbsp;I thought this was a very interesting and fun inclusion, and it reminded me of the 75054 AT-AT hatch feature. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There is more SNOT on this model than a 2nd grade classroom in the middle of winter, and that&#39;s a good thing.&nbsp;It is very sleek, yet robust looking, and is perfectly scaled to the on-screen version that we saw in the first trailer. &nbsp;I was hoping that the supply crate would fit Rey&#39;s hair, but there isn&#39;t enough room, so I stuffed as many of the clicker shooter studs into it as I could. &nbsp;There are a total of ten stickers, although none of them are very big. &nbsp;You could definitely get away with not putting most of them on, although I would definitely put the top three&nbsp;orange ones on, as it keeps the symmetry with the orange highlights on the bottom.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is definitely a great way to start off another product collection. &nbsp;All of the sets look very interesting to me, even if they are overpriced a bit. The one&nbsp;problem I have is that the only sets that look like they are meant to compliment each other are 75102 and 75101 (the orange X-Wing and the negative TIE), so there is no companion piece for this set.&nbsp;I doubt I will purchase the new Falcon, as 4504 still holds a very special place in my heart, and I could never shelve it in favor of the newer one. &nbsp;It looks very nice though, so I might consider having TWO Falcons on my shelf...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Amazingly built</p>

<p>Great SNOT techniques</p>

<p>Solid</p>

<p>Much cheaper way to get Rey</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Probably should have been $15</p>

<p>No companion piece&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a VERY nice set, and if you don&#39;t have too much money, I would recommend getting this set before any of the others in the Force Awakens line.</p>

"Derfel","2015-09-19T20:58:05.923Z","...in a dieselpunk Galaxy far far away.....","<p>75099: &nbsp;This was the first set I wanted from the new Star Wars release. &nbsp;Before I go on and talk about the set, I think the art department of Episode VII deserve to take a bow, they have done a fantastic job with the&nbsp;source material. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The first thing we saw was Rey powering out between a fallen X-Wing and a Star Destroyer draped over the horizon&nbsp;like&nbsp;a mountain range. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the ascetics of the&nbsp;design or the tease of the trailer&nbsp;but I wanted that speeder&nbsp;straight away.&nbsp; Episode VII started well. &nbsp;Despite being&nbsp;the smallest of the Ep.VII LEGO sets Rey&#39;s speeder improved&nbsp;on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love the dieselpunk look of the machine, Star Wars always had these little nods to contemporary&nbsp;Earthling style - the Millennium Falcon is a flying saucer at heart, the Y-Wing and X-Wing a clear reference&nbsp;to the Hurricane and Spitfire - one workmanlike and scruffy the other a&nbsp;worrying&nbsp;beauty. &nbsp;Has anyone not looked at our &#39;small moon&#39; and made out the laser dish from Copernicus crater?</p>

<p>I love the ascetic of the steam and dieselpunk&nbsp;universe,&nbsp;to see&nbsp;crossover into that other Galaxy far far away&nbsp;makes me tingle. &nbsp;We haven&#39;t seen anything yet.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box shows Rey knocking down Ungar&#39;s Thug, I&#39;m sure this occurs in the movie, but kicking up dust in&nbsp;front of a wrecked Star destroyer and this would probably have been the first LEGO box I kept for good. &nbsp;The back shows the lid of the scavenger box being used as a BTTF hover board, I hope we get to see that in the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Two bags full of interesting colour. &nbsp;The dark red is a favorite of mine in LDD and I hope to see greater use of it. &nbsp;There are a lot of stickers and&nbsp;they do enhance the weather beaten&nbsp;look, printing would have made it&nbsp;exceptional. &nbsp;The new 1x2 stud shooters might not be entirely accurate but&nbsp;still add&nbsp;muscle to the design.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>2x2 clear trans slide shoes are used to give the impression of flying. &nbsp;Strange then &nbsp;that a 2x2 dark grey inverted&nbsp;square is used at the back, ruins&nbsp;the perception. &nbsp;At first I thought a round slide might not have given enough stability under the tail, but I&nbsp;exchanged it for a spare shoe and it works fine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Rey&nbsp;became an instant hit with my daughters, the hair, freckles and bizarrely&nbsp;her headscarf and goggles were the first thing they replicated with sunglasses and a shawl. &nbsp;They haven&#39;t seen any trailer and Star Wars means nothing to them, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;m getting that one back.<br />
<br />
I still think of two faced heads as new and Rey&#39;s two expressions:&nbsp;cross and crosser, don&#39;t show a huge range of emotion&nbsp;but work really well with the muscular speeder and her hard existence on Jakku.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were enough spare parts to modify Ungar&#39;s thug. &nbsp;His simple golden crowbar became the cross piece for the spare shaft, and with the two spare lightsaber&nbsp;hilts and remaining small rim it all became a&nbsp;shoulder launched multi-red-1x1-stud SAM. &nbsp;Went together so easily from the spares I almost thought it was meant to end up like that. &nbsp;Looks far more menacing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Straightforward and yet interesting. &nbsp;It&#39;s a small set with few chances for creative methods, but for a model I intended to display&nbsp;the assembly process was a welcome&nbsp;bonus.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I love the big front grille, the long nose and twin stacked engines. &nbsp;Together with the opening side panels, tools, scavenge pod, hoverboard and controls there&#39;s an&nbsp;awful lot going on in&nbsp;something no bigger than my hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box art suggests Rey should be seated leaning backwards saloon style. &nbsp;But the film suggests a motorbike riding stance would have been more appropriate. &nbsp;The model works well if you push Rey as far forward as possible, but it&#39;s an opportunity for modification.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Score</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to use Brickset&rsquo;s format for continuity but will add my own LEGO standard, the 4x4 system.</p>

<p>The first 4 concern how many building phases you had to go through: 1) first build, according to the instructions; 2) rebuild and try to improve it; 3) rebuild because you have to improve it; 4) give up and turn it into a spaceship.</p>

<p>The second 4 concern how you keep it: 1) a thing of beauty, put it on display and disassemble only if absolutely necessary; 2) disassemble carefully to enjoy putting it back together; 3) disassemble to work-in improvements as required; 4) disassemble immediately&nbsp;and turn it into parts for a spaceship.</p>

<p>For example: 21108, Ghostbuster&rsquo;s Ecto-1 was an almost perfect 1x1, turning 1x2; 7140, X-Wing was a fun 2x3 that turned into a 2x1; 7754 Home One was a good for parts 4x4. My system is based on the premise that even the worst set in original configuration was a good source of spares and ideas, therefore a good kick for the imagination.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love it, well priced, interesting and lovely to display. &nbsp;A 1x1 by my reckoning, I might see if I can&#39;t modify the seating arrangements so it could&nbsp;end up a 2x1.&nbsp;</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-12-17T18:22:23.377Z","Right from Jakku's wastelands","<p>I bought Rey&#39;s Speeder before watching&nbsp;&quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;. I decided to open it on Christmas, but after&nbsp;I went to the cinema I couldn&#39;t resist and I had to build it. I&#39;ve to say that the speeder is pretty loyal to original model, Lego did a good work. But the reason why I bought it is Rey, and I actually enjoyed her&nbsp;minifigure as much as I enjoyed&nbsp;her character in the movie.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is small but very nice. It displays all the play features of the set (which are a lot for a 200 pieces model) and makes us see Unkar&#39;s&nbsp;thug trying to stop Rey, without any success. Instructions are written in one little book and are very easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are divided in two bags: the first is for the building of the core of the speeder; the second for its completion. There are some nice bricks, as the spoilers, the macrobinocular, the circular saw and the shoulder bag. Generally speaking, all these dark red parts seems to me quite rare. Some stickers are used to complete the paintings.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set includes two minifigures: Rey and Unkar&#39;s&nbsp;Thug. Rey is one of the main characters, and we can see her looking like in the greatest&nbsp;part of TFA, wearing sand yellow clothes and also a sort of turban (she used it on Jakku due to high temperatures and wind carrying sand). I love the &quot;helmet&quot;, it&#39;s very funny, and not so different from the original one; all the clothing is very good-looking. I do like the shoulder bag too. Unkar&#39;s Thug is a very secondary character (we can see him having a melee fight with Rey in the trailers) but as I remember him from the movie, it&#39;s well made. I&#39;m not so sure about his weapon, honestly I think it isn&#39;t so appropriate, but I may be wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was easy, quite funny and fast. You start with the base, then you go up adding all the dark red parts till you create the &quot;womb&quot; that can be opened on the sides. I appreciated very much the fact that you can immediately see what you build as it will appear: when you add some pieces, probably they will be possible to be seen in the completed&nbsp;model. I really liked building the rear, which is created in more than one passage.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed set looks nice. It&#39;s small but full of details, and as I said before it isn&#39;t far from original model. Maybe the part of the &quot;stomach&quot; which isn&#39;t covered by doors could be a bit better, although&nbsp;it isn&#39;t bad. Shooters are hidden well, as they are put in an existing part of the speeder (but at first I thought it had been added by Lego). There are some nice tools, and you will find a lot of play features that don&#39;t waste its appearance.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think that it&#39;s a good set. It isn&#39;t overpriced (I paid it 27&euro;, which is a good price, also considering the price for piece rate) and thanks to it you will get one of the main characters (probably&nbsp;the most important). I won&#39;t probably use the speeder, and it will end up somewhere in my basement, but I like it and so I don&#39;t blame Lego for making me pay 27&euro; just to get Rey (in fact, till now, this is the only way to reach her).</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; High detailed</p>

<p>&ndash; Low price and standard price-for-piece rating</p>

<p>&ndash; Only way to get Rey till now</p>

<p>&ndash; Lots of play features</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Unkar&#39;s Thug is a very secondary character</p>

<p>&ndash; Speeder is just a speeder, and you will see it very few in the movie</p>

"dylcap","2016-01-12T15:50:43.143Z","Review: 75099-1: Rey's Speeder","<p><u><strong>(SPOILER ALERT) - This review does include minor spoilers from Star Wars: The Force Awakens</strong>&nbsp;</u></p>

<p><strong>Set:&nbsp;</strong>75099-1: Rey&#39;s Speeder<br />
<strong>AUD:&nbsp;</strong>I paid $39 at Target, but I have seen it as low as $25 at Kmart.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some particularly interesting parts in this set, including the spoilers at the back (which I think might be new). They are split over two bags. The first bag includes the main bulk of the speeder, while the second adds trimmings and the front end.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>A relatively straight forward build, with descriptive instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Rey</strong></p>

<p>I was incredibly excited to add Rey to my collection. She&#39;s a fascinating character, and I&#39;m glad she was given her own smaller set over someone such as Finn. The detailed printing on the torso is excellent, the hairpiece is an exact replica, and the cloth wrap for her head is perfect. I&#39;m also a big fan of the shoulder bag - this is the first set I&#39;ve bought with one in it. The bag could have simply been printed on, but Lego added the extra dimension.</p>

<p>The only downside I can think of is that there&#39;s not a huge difference between her two faces. It also seems unnecessary to have two faces for such a basic set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Unkar&#39;s thug</strong></p>

<p>The significant level of detail on such a background character who has less than a minute of screen time is surprising. The dark grey hood and the golden hook bar really add to the figure, and I feel this second figure really helps promote playability.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Construction is quite basic. It took me about 10 to 15 minutes, and I was taking my time. One downside - I found it a little difficult when connecting the side panels to the hinges. While it took a little adjusting on the hinge, there was a moment where the set felt vulnerable, so it pays to apply a light pressure as opposed to forcing the side panel.</p>

<p>One downside is a pretty universal disdain for Lego - stickers. They&#39;re flimsy, and if they&#39;re not placed on straightly, they can detract from the final set. Most of the stickers could have easily been prints.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;m really impressed by the final model. It&#39;s a good-sized set and represents good value for money. It&#39;s an incredibly mobile toy, and I can imagine a younger me spending hours speeding it across the house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If there&#39;s one thing I don&#39;t quite like it&#39;s the canons on the sides. These aren&#39;t at all relevant to the film, and it seems odd from a Star Wars perspective that a cheap and basic mode of transport needs to have two canons. While it&#39;s clearly an addition to increase playability, I feel it&#39;s unnecessary, and will probably cover it up with two flat tiles 4x1.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a really decent set. With two minifigures and an incredibly fun speeder to play with, this set is a must have for all Star Wars Lego fans. It also looks great displayed on a stack of transparent&nbsp;bricks 2x2.</p>

"Witolman","2016-01-08T19:18:12.54Z","Bestest flash drive speeder, period!","<p>Sorry in advance for my English.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 2:</p>

<p>-Rey- Amazing minifig. She has very nice printing, and very good accessories. There&#39;s a bag to collect junk, her stick and goggles to protect from sand. Surprisingly, she can look left and right with the goggles on. I love the shape of this mini helmet.She also has a nice hair piece.</p>

<p>-Unkar&#39;s Thug- He has impressive amount of details, both on the body and the head, but because of his 10-second movie appearance he&#39;s not really important. It&#39;s just a bad guy for kids to play with. I still like him though. He comes with a gold crowbar.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fast, interesting, and very enjoyable,</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s start with things I don&#39;t like: STICKERS!!! They&#39;re not that bad here, but still, applying them is a pain, and if you mess it up it looks Really ugly. Another thing are those stud shooters Lego forces everywhere, the don&#39;t retract That much from the look of this model, but it would look much better without them and sadly you can&#39;t take them off because there are no other pieces to cover the black studs underneath. My last complain is that the left side looks rather boring, though you can fix that with spare parts so I guess it&#39;s okay</p>

<p>Now the positives and, oh my, there are lots of them. I love how does this model look, it&#39;s simply gorgeous. The shape, the colors, <span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">accuracy to the film, ALL OF IT! Some say that it has a wrong color, but I think it&#39;s good, maybe one shade of red/orange off.</span></span> I also like the &#39;junk&#39; on the side of this speeder. I know it should be in a net, but it still looks great. There&#39;s also an awesome play-feature: opening and closing. I know this doesn&#39;t sound that awesome, but it is. You open the right or left flap bu turning the lower engine. It&#39;s hidden so well you wouldn&#39;t know about it, if someone didn&#39;t tell you (or build the set). Inside there&#39;s some space for studs(ammo) and a sand sled that Rey uses. I prefer storing her hair here, and putting the sled on the side of this flash drive.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Probably the best set of the first wave of TheForceAwakens.</p>

<p>-Rey</p>

<p>-her goggles/mask</p>

"Professor_X","2016-01-11T21:06:14.71Z","""I couldn't find a quote that had to do with this speeder, so too bad!""","<h2>WARNING! This review may contain minor spoilers about The Force Awakens. If you&#39;re in the percentage of human beings who haven&#39;t seen it yet, beware!</h2>

<p>When the first trailer for the Force Awakens came out, I was intrigued with the little beat up speeder hovering across the deserts of what I thought was Tatooine(but was of course Jakku). I litterally&nbsp;thought in my mind when I first saw it, &quot;When LEGO makes all of their Force Awakens sets, this will definetly be the cheapest in the wave.&quot; Well obviously I was right, and I had been interested &nbsp;to get my hands on one of these ever since it was confirmed. So is Rey&#39;s speeder a must have addition to your collection? or is a set that only the serious collector&#39;s will care about? read on to find out...</p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>The Build was very straightforward, obviously, since its only composed of the speeder itself and two minifigures. While it had been a while since I&#39;d bought a Star Wars set and it was nostalgic for that reason, It was a pretty simple build and so wasn&#39;t extremely interesting to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Minifigures:</h3>

<h4>Rey:</h4>

<p>Rey was an interesting character in the movie, one who&nbsp;I&#39;m sure will join the greats of Star Wars in no time, and her minifigure represents her very well. While her minifgure isn&#39;t perfect, she is still instantly recognizable and&nbsp;The ragged cloth criss-crossed across her torso looks particularly&nbsp;great. Rey&#39;s head piece is printed with two expressions, one with a half smile and the other serious. Her head can either be topped with her newly molded hair piece or her head wrap for when she&#39;s speedering(yes, that&#39;s a word... now...) across the desert. While her hair piece is perfect, it&#39;s her head wrap that I believe will be the most desirable piece in this set as it would look great not just on Star Wars characters but on post-apoc&nbsp;minifgures as well. She is armed with her staff of course and also comes with a classic Indiana Jones Shoulder bag which I&#39;ve been glad to see in use recently.</p>

<h4>Unkar&#39;s&nbsp;Thug:</h4>

<p>Probably the most obscure out of all the Force Awakens Minifigures, this Unkar&#39;s Thug&nbsp;appears to be based on one of the thugs hired by Unkar&nbsp;Plutt(duh!) to steal BB-8 from Rey after Rey refuses to sell him. None the less, this Minifigure is still very detailed and&nbsp;also comes with some great parts including a dark grey hood, A new dark metal head piece, and a rare gold crow bar(on a side note, is it just me or is Unkar&#39;s Thug&#39;s mask reminiscent of a Tusken Raider?).</p>

<h3>The Completed Set:</h3>

<p>The Speeder itself,&nbsp;while not dead on in its resemblance of the real thing, is still instantly recognizable and has a lot going for it. First off, while the actual model is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, it&#39;s actually a lot bigger than it should be compared to the minifigure. Nonetheless, I believe the increase in size allows a lot more detail to be added so it&#39;s something that can be overlooked in my opinion. The shaping of the speeder is great, with the dual engines replicated perfectly. The lower of the two engines can be turned from side to side to open the two sides like doors. doing so reveals a crate inside though ironically none of the loose accessories can actually fit inside. dual stud shooters adorn both sides and actually don&#39;t look too&nbsp;bad, most likely do to the fact that they&#39;ve been cast in dark red for the first time. A saw, macrobinoculars, some sort of gun, Rey&#39;s staff, and the shoulder bag&nbsp;can be attached to&nbsp;the left side of the craft, presumably mimicking all of the parts and tools strapped there&nbsp;in the movie. There are a few stickers to represent some of the orange streaks on the sides, the tail fins on the back, and a control panel among other things. While some may think these are cumbersome, I think they add a lot more detail and that the quality of the model is improved a lot as a result.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts:</h3>

<p>At a price point of $24.99 CA/$19.99 US, this set&#39;s price/per rate ratio is pretty average. However, the size of what you get makes this model a little lacking and&nbsp;some may decide not to buy it for that reason. In my opinion, though, this is an interesting model and speaking as a speeder fan is a great addition to my collection. For some one looking for an attractive, inexpensive Star Wars set I would definitely recommend this. But if you&#39;re looking for an iconic set from The Force Awakens, you may want to buy one of the more expensive models available.</p>

<p><br />
Con la reci&eacute;n salida al p&uacute;blico de la nueva entrega de Star Wars: The Force Awakens, era m&aacute;s que necesario conseguir los sets m&aacute;s relevantes a esta pel&iacute;cula. Rey&rsquo;s Speeder fue el set que llam&oacute; mi atenci&oacute;n tanto por su dise&ntilde;o como por la inc&oacute;gnita de no saber quien es Rey. El set tal como se muestra en la caja es de un tono des&eacute;rtico con rojos y grises predominando el esquema de colores. Aun sin haber visto el contenido o las instrucciones sab&iacute;a que iba a ser todo un deleite armar este modelo.</p>

<h3><br />
Partes</h3>

<p><br />
El conteo de piezas, con el nuevo precio ajustado a $19.99 d&oacute;lares estadounidenses, es bastante equilibrado. La variedad de piezas en tonos rojos y grises es bastante agradable para posteriores MOC. Consta de una gran variedad de piezas peque&ntilde;as y medianas, lo cual se aprecia bastante ya que aumenta el nivel de construcci&oacute;n y la satisfacci&oacute;n de completar cada secci&oacute;n del modelo. Los accesorios&nbsp;para un set de este precio creo que hacen que se justifique aun m&aacute;s el nuevo precio.</p>

<h3><br />
Minifiguras</h3>

<p><br />
El set consta de dos minifiguras, Rey y un Mat&oacute;n de Unkar. El detalle en ambos es muy bueno. Iniciemos con el mat&oacute;n. El dise&ntilde;o del cuerpo es bastante interesante, ya que han usado pintura plateada para resaltar ciertos puntos del traje. Tal pareciera que son acentos met&aacute;licos en el traje que se puede ver en ambos lados impresos del mat&oacute;n. Viene con una capucha para las tormentas de arena muy bien dise&ntilde;ada. Solo cuenta con una impresi&oacute;n en la cabeza, sin variante pero creo que cumple bastante bien su funci&oacute;n de aparentar hostilidad. Se incluye una palanca amarilla como arma pero en realidad puede ser una herramienta m&aacute;s de Rey si as&iacute; lo quieres. Por otro lado tenemos a Rey que cuenta con dise&ntilde;o impreso en ambos lados, un bast&oacute;n como arma de defensa, un bolso muy bien adaptado pero sencillo en su dise&ntilde;o. Cuenta con dos impresiones de cara en la cabeza, una enojada y otra con una m&aacute;s relajada neutra. Adem&aacute;s puedes utilizar a Rey con su capucha para tormentas de arena, que viene con visor integrado y los detalles impresos incluidos son muy apreciados. Si quieres mostrar el rostro de Rey, puedes colocarte su cabello caracter&iacute;stico con tres botones. Ambas minifiguras me han dejado satisfecho.</p>

<h3><br />
La Construcci&oacute;n</h3>

<p><br />
La construcci&oacute;n del set lleva una secuencia bastante fluida. No cuenta con partes muy elaboradas pero si se debe tomar en cuenta que cada etapa lleva una cantidad considerable de piezas peque&ntilde;as. Esto en lo personal m&aacute;s que ser algo negativo fue todo lo contrario. Al ser tantas piezas peque&ntilde;as en un set tan peque&ntilde;o hace la experiencia de la construcci&oacute;n m&aacute;s satisfactoria. El sistema de compuertas es un detalles que me ha gustado mucho, en especial por el valor de jugabilidad que agrega ese mecanismo. Definitivamente un modelo recomendado.</p>

<h3><br />
El Modelo Completo</h3>

<p><br />
El modelo terminado es de un tama&ntilde;o ideal para jugar sin mayor problema. La estructura es bastante firme, a&uacute;n con los accesorios instalados es bastante dif&iacute;cil que algo se desprenda con golpes moderados. Los accesorios son bastante buenos ya que te dan varias opciones para jugar. Desde una sierra para cortar metal hasta un Blaster para batallas a corto alcance o persecuciones. Muy vers&aacute;til para ser un modelo tan peque&ntilde;o.</p>

<h3>Opini&oacute;n Final</h3>

<p><br />
Tomando en cuenta todo lo anterior, este set es perfecto para iniciarse en el mundo de Lego Star Wars a un nivel intermedio, ya que no olvidemos los MicroFighters. La experiencia de construcci&oacute;n cumple con lo prometido y las minifiguras son una gran adici&oacute;n a la colecci&oacute;n. Como nota, a la fecha de esta redacci&oacute;n, la minifigura de Rey solo se puede adquirir en este set y en 75105 Star Wars Millennium Falcon.<br />

And so I&#39;ve decided to celebrate by posting reviews of each one, starting with the smallest and least expensive, Rey&#39;s speeder.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A relatively small box with the new Kylo Ren box art. The instructions are in one small booklet. I had absolutely no difficulty following them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve never been particularly interested in parts, but I like the burgundy bricks that make up the plating on the speeder.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set provides us with a cheap way to aquire Rey, which is desirable since both the Mellenium Falcon and Encounter on Jakku are a tad pricy. The minifigure features detailed, movie accurate printing as well as the briefly featured head dress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unkar&#39;s Thug was my personal favourite. He features very cool face printing and scavenger&#39;s clothing. He alone can almost justify purchasing the set, as he will also go well with Encounter on Jakku.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fast and simple. I must mention, however, that there are several stickers, though I don&#39;t think the overall appearance would suffer without them.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks good with all the other Force Awakens sets. The colour is a slight change from the movie, which doesn&#39;t particularly affect it&#39;s appeal.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is perfect for anyone looking to just add a little Force Awakens to their collection, but I would suggest spending the extra money for a larger set if you are a collector, as this is more of a play model than a display piece. Overall&nbsp;a good little set, especially for children.</p>
