"Altair1970","2015-11-25T10:54:34.307Z","A surprisingly beautiful new X-Wing!","<p>Here is my (short) review of Star Wars VI&#39;s brand new Poe&#39;s&nbsp;X-Wing Fighter</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box&#39;s images are detailed and attractive. 5 numbered bags are included, together with&nbsp;one big instruction booklet and a stickers sheet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set features 717 parts, including a nice all new transparent cockpit.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 4 (well, let us say 3,5...): Poe Dameron, another unknown Resistance pilot, an alien-looking Resistance ground crew, and the small cute ball-shaped&nbsp;new robot BB-8. The minifigs are well detailed and&nbsp;I particularly like the new yellow visors of the pilots.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A lot of fun! The build is somewhat different from the one of the previous X-Wing (9493), with more variety, for the wings in particular. Only the nose build is pretty much the same. Besides the X-Wing, you also have the pleasure of building a little vehicle to bring the pilots to the ship and a ladder to climb in it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It just looks amazing! Its curves are more &#39;&#39;sexy&#39;&#39; than its predecessor so&nbsp;it looks more aerodynamic, and also more&nbsp;powerful with all its missiles. The main differences besides the colors are the engines air intakes, the rear thrusters, the new cockpit,&nbsp;the wings shapes and the&nbsp;additional missiles. I&nbsp;found only one issue: BB-8 does not stick very well to the ship as it has a single point of attachment (so one should avoid too many aerobatics when the robot comes along!)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Being an unconditional&nbsp;fan of the &#39;&#39;old trilogy&#39;&#39; (IV-V-VI), I was a bit skeptical at first about this set as for me nothing could ever beat my beloved white/red/grey X-Wing with Luke and R2 inside. Well, I must admit I find Poe&#39;s X-Wing absolutely stunning with its new colors and shapes, its great engine air intakes&nbsp;and its new purple thrusters! A must have for any SW collector.</p>

"Nuruodo","2015-12-25T09:36:06.157Z","Poe Dameron in action!","<p>When I saw this set for the first time I loved it, but I didn&#39;t decide to buy till it reached a decent price (I found it at 70&euro;, instead of 100&euro;). I love Poe&#39;s character, and I love as well his pilot skills. In the movie he flies like Anakin&nbsp;or Luke, and you can only admire him. So I had to get his black/orange starfighter!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is long and very nice. It displays the X-wing pursued by a TIE fighter, with Poe&#39;s ship firing. You can already see the differences between classic X-wing (T-65 model) and new one (T-70 model) in the front of the box. Instructions are whole written in one book.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are divided in 5 bags: first for hangar objects and the base, second for the prow, third for the remaining central body, fourth and fifth for the wings. There are very nice parts, especially orange ones. There are rare bricks like cockpit, ones used for front and rear of engines (they are easier to be found in City or Creator sets).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You&#39;ll obtain three minifigures (and a droid): Poe Dameron, a Resistance pilot,&nbsp;a Resistance ground crew and BB-8. Poe is one of the main characters in TFA: I won&#39;t spoil anything, but I&#39;ll just tell that I love the character. His Lego version is very nice, and I love the helmet, as much as the other pilot&#39;s one. The flight suit is very detailed. The ground crew is an alien, he has different body and helmet, everything colored of green; I like it, although he isn&#39;t an important character. BB-8 is lovely, with its ball-shape well represented in Lego version.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I expected the build to be longer. I took instead just a couple of hours, maybe less. I particularly liked the build of the nose, very unusual and ingenious. I wasn&#39;t bored by the wings, that usually are repetitive due to their specular&nbsp;shape. But in this set, you&#39;ll need to build three pieces to assemble one wing, so you shouldn&#39;t be bored by it. Generally speaking, I do liked the build, and I enjoyed it a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is impressive. It&#39;s my first X-wing, so I won&#39;t compare it to older sets, but however it seems to me very well built. It&#39;s very accurate and loyal to original model. One thing that impressed me is the size: I didn&#39;t know it was so big! The wings open and close with a single rotation of the upper mechanism; I thought it was like ARC-170, in which you have to move the wheel for a bit before completely open the wings. In this set you&#39;ll just need to move it one time to immediately have the X opened. Engines are very nice, both in front and in rear. Only one thing disappointed me like everyone: the blue elastics in the rear. Ah, they are so unsightly,&nbsp;yes, but I&#39;ve to say that you can&#39;t see them from distances. Just when you are very close to wings and rear, you will see them. So, they aren&#39;t that bad.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I do like this model, both in movie and in Lego version. It&#39;s big but smart, with a really classic shape. However some differences, like the upper wings different from the lower ones, the reactors, the front of engines, are very appreciable. As a whole it&#39;s very beautiful to be seen, and it seems&nbsp;ready to fly. But as all TFA sets, it costs a lot, and this is a great problem. As I said before, however, I found it on Amazon.it at just 70&euro; (less then TIE fighter, that I paid 75&euro;). Buying it at a good&nbsp;price, so with a price-per-piece rating of about 10.0 cents, it&#39;s surely worth the expense. If you have to pay, like in my country, 100&euro;... I don&#39;t know, you&#39;ll surely enjoy it, but maybe 100&euro; for a X-wing fighter is really too much.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Detailed and loyal to original model</p>

<p>&ndash; Only way to get Poe Dameron till now</p>

<p>&ndash; Nice techniques (like the one used for the nose)</p>

<p>&ndash; Impressive!</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Blue elastics (but they are less showy than how much you can think)</p>

<p>&ndash; High price</p>

"Duq","2016-07-04T09:08:28.45Z","Swooshable, but with many flaws","<p>Initially I&#39;d left this set on the shelf but when I found it discounted to &euro;65 I decided to finally get it. Unfortunately it&#39;s not all good news...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box, with Kylo Wren in the corner, shows the X-wing in battle while the back shows a lot of details like the moving wings, the weapons and a nice blue-print. Nothing unusual then but I&#39;m still not used to seeing the Star Wars and Disney logos together. The instructions come in a single 124 page book. Way too long in my opinion but probably needed for the target audience.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Just over 700 parts come in 5 numbered bags. That&#39;s a good bit more than the 560 parts in the previous X-wing. That&#39;s partly because of the ground support vehicle and ladder that are included, partly because there are more parts used to construct the engines.</p>

<p>As is obvious from the pictures, most of the parts are black and orange; lots of plates, tiles and (curved) slopes. There are also some grey (light and dark) Technic parts for the wing mechanism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are 16 stickers included, mostly for decoration of the wings and engines.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 4 minifigures in the set if you count BB-8. He&#39;s made up of only 2 pieces and looks good, although the stud on the top of his head is spoiling the shape. It&#39;s worse than on R2&#39;s dome because the head is a good bit smaller.</p>

<p>Next is a ground crew member in olive green overalls, nicely printer front and back.</p>

<p>Finally there are two pilots in dark orange flight suits. Poe and the anonymous pilot have the same torso and legs but different face and helmet prints.</p>

<p>All minifigure prints are flawless. My only comment is that the pilots helmet doesn&#39;t work with the double-face heads; you see Poe&#39;s beard peeking out below the helmet in his neck.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building is enjoyable and not that difficult. Despite the complex shape there is surprisingly little SNOT. If you&#39;ve built 9493 X-wing before you&#39;ll have some deja-vu when building the nose section as it&#39;s virtually identical. Bag 5 is mostly a repeat of bag 4, each bag containing a pair of wings.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once built it&#39;s a striking model, thanks largely to the orange and black colour scheme. The new canopy piece also looks great. The wing action works great with a simple twist of the knob on top opening them to attack position. It&#39;s pretty swooshable and with 6 shooters on board you can fire a lot before having to reload.</p>

<p>As a model of the X-wing from the movie I&#39;m afraid there are some serious issues. First of all the wings. They are just wrong, there&#39;s no way around it. The wings on the T-70 should come together as a single wing with the top wing sitting behind the bottom. In this Lego model there is a gap between the overlapping sections of the wing. The look of the wings is further spoiled by the shooters on the wing tips.</p>

<p>Two more shooters either side of the cockpit are for play only; they don&#39;t belong on an X-wing. At the back the bright blue rubber bands are in plain view. It would have been nice to have them hidden or at least use black. The knob on top for opening the wings is not pretty though it doesn&#39;t stand out. Still, it would be better to have it underneath.</p>

<p>As with all previous Lego X-wings the landing gear at the back is in the wrong place; it should be under the wings but instead it&#39;s two stubs under the body. Finally the nose section as mentioned is the same shape as on the previous X-wing which is wrong for the T-70; it shouldn&#39;t have the slightly wider tip.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The verdict very much depends on your perspective. For children this is a great set; it&#39;s swooshable, it&#39;s got a number of weapons, and it comes with the ground support crew. For adults it&#39;s a disappointing model with many flaws.</p>

<p>At the original price it&#39;s not cheap and at that price I would have expected more printed parts instead of stickers.</p>

"LegoAlanJames","2016-01-08T17:50:30.503Z","Great small and BIG kids","<p>As an adult fan of Lego (hey I admit it, Lego is cool) with children I can honestly say this set is amazing.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box attracted me to the set. As simple as that. I saw it in the shop and grabbed it without a second thought. The fact there were only two left (and I had looked in 6 previous shops failing to find one that had it in stock) made no difference.</p>

<p>The instructions manual is, finally, an actual manual which didn&#39;t fall to pieces like the stapled versions we&#39;ve seen and been subjected to over the years. The only downside (and it&#39;s minor) is the colouring of the pieces in the book. In poor lighting (especially as I get head aches from bright bulbs) the variations in grey or clear bricks/studs can slow my build...or make it more challenging depending on my mood.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some lovely parts included in this set. I&#39;m not geeky enough to know which parts are unique to the set, but from a fans point of view I adore the canopy and the method of making the nose cone.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Depending on whether you class&nbsp;BB8 as a mini figure or not, he is still pretty cool. My children have fallen in love with the little guy and a reason why my son wanted this set as much as I.</p>

<p>Poe Dameron&nbsp;is a great figure, and one that may not appear in too many sets. The other X-wing pilot is cool too (and will either be the victim of a First Order kidknapp or a rescuer of Poe in the future). The technician dude adds some variation to the set, and works well when playing with the set, as he can come along and fix any problems.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I usually rush through a build, however, with work and the need for sleep I allowed the build to take three days. Slowing myself down allowed the full enjoyment of building every piece. my children usually help me build the Star Wars sets we purchase (or should that be I help them?) as they know how much I &nbsp;have always loved the films (episodes 1-3 less so though). They built the engineers vehicle&nbsp;and the rest of packet one (there are five bags by the way and some stickers), but were&nbsp;happy for me to complete the rest.</p>

<p>I have no doubt my 9 year old son could have built most of this on his own, but even I struggle to line up the stickers onto the pieces (I&#39;m a perfectionist when it comes to stickers, after messing up on my non-Lego Millennium Falcon as a young boy). Slotting some of the Technic pieces is also a struggle for my son, but a more experienced builder would have little trouble.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is amazing. After I finished I jumped for joy and flew the X-Wing around the living room. When my son came home he did the same. We&#39;re very much alike. A First Order micro fighter then flew in via my daughter and Poe and BB8 had to quickly defend themselves.</p>

<p>There was also a good number of spare parts from this set, including one on the black curved sections, which looks very detailed and I&#39;m sure fairly unused in other sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>From buying to building to playing Poe Dameron&#39;s&nbsp;X-Wing is fantastic in Lego. The 5/5 on every area was given great thought and there just wasn&#39;t a reason to dock points from the set. Thank you Lego, you have made a BIG kid (aged 33) and a small kid (9) very happy.</p>

"Black_Leader","2016-01-17T04:55:34.18Z","Black One is Number One!!!","<p>As my username suggests, I love me some Poe Dameron. In my opinion, the scenes highlighting the&nbsp;budding bromance&nbsp;between Poe&nbsp;and Finn or when he is sassing Kylo Ren were some of the standouts&nbsp;of The Force Awakens and give&nbsp;me hope that his role will be expanded in the&nbsp;next installments. Considering that I hold these&nbsp;sentiments, it should come as no surprise that this is easily my favorite Episode 7 set released up to now. Combining the spectacular character of Poe Dameron with the second most iconic vessel&nbsp;of Star Wars give this ship the hallmarks of a classic along the lines of 6210 Jabba&#39;s&nbsp;Sail Barge. The last set&nbsp;I enjoyed&nbsp;this much was&nbsp;the 75021 Republic Gunship, which is some pretty lofty company. So before you start to think that I was brainwashed by the Lego Group, read on to discover why this set should be in your collection.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art for this set immediately draws you in, as it depicts&nbsp;Black One (The starfighter&#39;s&nbsp;proper name) skimming over the icy surface of Starkiller base, firing missiles and being pursued by TIE fighters. The red of the Kylo Ren box heading really helps to make the blue and white of the tundra pop, making this the most eye catching of all the Lego Episode 7 packaging. As usual, the back highlights the features and accessories of the set, while also&nbsp;including nifty holographic blueprints. The instructions for Poe&#39;s X-wing Fighter were pleasant surprise, with actual binding and for once not being mangled, though this may have&nbsp;just been&nbsp;luck since no cardboard was included.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Though a smaller selection than one would expect from a set of this price, the minifigures included with Black One pack a sizable punch without making the set a glorified battle pack. Too often these days with licensed themes, the figures are the only draw in an otherwise lackluster build (Looking at you, Battle on Takodana). Poe is clearly the star in this category, since as of this writing he is only available in this set. I can&#39;t wait to get him in his/Finn&#39;s jacket, maybe in a Jakku build with Lor San Tekka. His pilot outfit is good enough though, chock full of detailed prints of the&nbsp;hoses, straps, and the white vest. While the burnt orange coloring is better than the previous neon and I look forward to seeing it on OT pilots, I feel that it would more accurate if it was a bit redder. Poe&#39;s distinctive black and red helmet is superb, with incredibly detailed printing and wonderful double molding, thankfully making it so the visor&nbsp;doesn&#39;t have to printed on the figure&#39;s face. Black Leader has a fairly accurate double sided head, one side with a confident grin and the other with an aggressive frown. Our hero is armed with a small blaster pistol that can be stowed away behind his seat in the cockpit of Black One. Our generic pilot has the same legs and torso as Poe but with simple determined head that has been used already on numerous Resistance soldiers. His helmet is predominantly white and red and continues the over molding and detail found on his commander&#39;s headgear. It would have been nice to get a named pilot like Ello Asty&nbsp;or Jess Pava, but this fellow, who I have christened Oscar, is decent enough for filling out scenes in the background. Oscar is also armed with a blaster pistol.&nbsp;Next we have one of the few new aliens from the first wave of The Force Awakens products, the lowly ground crewman&nbsp;Goss&nbsp;Toowers. I&#39;m sure someday he&#39;ll have an entire dissertation&nbsp;written about him&nbsp;on Wookieepedia and how he was crucial to the destruction of Starkiller Base, but for now he is so insignificant the Lego didn&#39;t feel&nbsp;that it was worth the effort to spell his name and thus labeled our friend as Resistance Ground Crew. His figure&nbsp;is very accurate to his photo is the DK Visual Dictionary, with the olive green being particularly sharp especially when it is juxtaposed with the orange on his helmet. Toower&#39;s&nbsp;face is an interesting peach color and is one sided, and it&#39;s big alien eyes have many applications for sci-fi builders. Since he part of the ground crew, Toowers is equipped with an oversized wrench. Finally, the droid the stole everyone&#39;s hearts, BB-8, is included in set, same as in 75105 Millennium&nbsp;Falcon. I feel like the Lego Group&nbsp;did the best they could without making an overly complicated and expensive figure. I especially appreciate the fact that each of the four prints on his sides are unique rather than repeated. BB-8 fits in nicely if a little loosely in the traditional astromech&nbsp;spot of the starfighter,&nbsp;and is not in danger of falling out. Since the X-wing is a one man fighter, it&#39;s hard to add&nbsp;an excessive amount of minifigures, and I feel that Lego did a good job on the ones they did include. Perhaps a Resistance soldier or two or even General Leia&nbsp;could have been additions, but they are in other sets and fit better there.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>If you ask anyone who has built the UCS Millennium Falcon, an amazing set does not always equal a fun build. Thankfully, that disparity is not manifested in Black One, which is interesting without being overly stressful. The engineering of the nose and hull specifically used techniques&nbsp;that I had not encountered before and that really add a lot to the ship. The build&nbsp;and minifigures are distributed across five bags, beginning with the hull and extras and ending with the right wings and engines. There is a surprising little amount of technic, which I know is a relief to some. The one issue I had with the build was that the engines, while aesthetically&nbsp;pleasing, are not connected well to the wings. They are connected only by a single technic axle that cannot fit entirely into the brick on the wings. I feel that this could&nbsp;be strengthened via the use of a longer axle and a second brick behind the first. One complaint some may raise is the incredible amount of stickers. Personally I feel that they are used appropriately as accents and add to the model, but one can omit them and still have an impressive ship. Though I am not the kind who demolishes their sets for scrap, I would like to point the beauty of the new cockpit canopy mold. It is very faithful to the films and is thankfully not stickered. The new glass is so good that it makes all other Lego x-wings look foolish, making me wish that Lego will update their OT X-wings in the near future. The build took me about an hour and half overall.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>At the risk of sounding redundant, this model is the epitome of what a Lego starfighter should be. It is sleek and swooshable, with the plethora of smooth plates adding a degree of realism uncommon in most non UCS sets. A lot of ink has been spilled regarding the Halloween color scheme, but once the shiny new black and orange pieces collide and contrast, the result is a work of art (I would also like to point out that the reason for the vibrant paint is that it supposedly disrupts enemy scanners. I suppose the colors are just too distracting for the measly First Order scanners that are used to gray, gray, black, and cement.). The one section that breaks the color scheme is the blue rubber bands used for the moving wings. These bands look horrible and I for the life of me can&#39;t understand why Lego didn&#39;t use orange or black or gray, colors they have made before. Unfortunately, these bands are essential to the main feature of the vessel, the opening and closing of the wings. This is done by turning a knob behind BB-8, a different position than previous X-wings. The new location of the knob may have something to do with the one crank that it takes to change the S-foils position, an improvement over most&nbsp;of the&nbsp;older models in which you cranked until your arm fell off. In an effort to simulate the split wing design of the T-70 X-wings, the bottom wings of the ship extend out farther than the ones on top, the best approximation that could be made at this scale&nbsp;I think. The four laser cannons at the end of each wing would have benefited from a dish behind them like on the previous X-wings, but&nbsp;they do their job and their accompanying spring loaded shooters add a necessary and fun play feature. The use of wheel rims to make the split engines was an inspired choice and all the smooth pieces surrounding them scream sophistication. The side mounted stud shooters underneath the cockpit are still annoying, but are thankfully easy to ignore. For once the underside of the craft is&nbsp;slightly fleshed out, though it is still spare compared to the rest of the starfighter. The appearance of this model is Lego at its finest.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In conclusion, it&rsquo;s easy to see why as of this writing Poe&rsquo;s X-wing Fighter is sold out on Lego Shop at Home. It combines all the nostalgia of the Original Trilogy with all the promise of The Force Awakens in a superbly designed model. Though the price per part may be a little steep, at no point after obtaining this set have I felt like Black One wasn&rsquo;t worth the money. Price per part is rather ridiculous anyway, considering that it assigns the same worth to spectacular pieces like the over molded helmets or the remarkable new canopy to common items like studs. While nothing will ever be as iconic as the Falcon, this was easily the most recognizable new ship of The Force Awakens. It is after all, the ship that blew up Starkiller Base. Though the minifigure selection may not be as awe-inspiring as some of the other Force Awakens releases, the characters are quality nonetheless and essential for all collectors. If you are kid, use your parents&rsquo; memories of the original Star Wars movies to get this set. They may not recognize the First Order Transporter, but the X-wing is a ship that will likely bring to mind fond memories for anyone who grew up with Luke and R2-D2. If you don&#39;t have Black One yet, stop reading and go buy it now. This will be a ship that&rsquo;ll be remade like all the greats before it, but why wait?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts were nice and varied in this set, including lots of different snot bricks and many nice orange parts.&nbsp; We also get metallic silver wheel bases used for the engines, which makes the model look really accurate.&nbsp; What finishes it off is the new printed canopy piece, made specifically for an X-Wing, giving the model a great finished look.&nbsp; Unfortunately the rubber bands used to clamp the wings together are bright blue, which clash with the black and orange of the rest of the model.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure selection is definitely a highlight in this set, especially with the inclusion of BB-8, which is made up of two new printed pieces.&nbsp; Poe Dameron, as well as the other X-Wing pilot, looks great with the printed torso and helmets.&nbsp; The helmets are especially nice and detailed, using two types of plastic to accomplish the look of the clear visor.&nbsp; The ground crew minifigure is unnecessary in my opinion but nice to get.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly complex&nbsp;with the use of&nbsp;upside-down and sideways building.&nbsp; Although it is similar to the past incarnation of the X-Wing, there are some new techniques used, especially in the wings to accomplish the new engine look.&nbsp; There is also the inclusion of stud shooters on the side of the main fuselage, as well as regular shooters on each wing next to the brick built weapons.&nbsp; The back of the engines which stick out of the back of the model look cool, but are a bit wobbly due to the rubber bands being right there, blocking a secure connection to the wing.&nbsp; The ground crew transport and ladder is a nice addition, and is great for storing extra studs for the stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is one of the best X-Wing fighters Lego has ever produced.&nbsp; The playability in the model is outstanding, with six different projectiles and opening wings via a black gear on the top of the model.&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all, this is a great set for any Star Wars collection, even with the new foreign design from TFA.&nbsp;</p>

La costruzione, i colori, l&#39;ingeneria, i pezzi&nbsp;mobili e le scelte stilistiche sono veramente eccellenti. Adoro i colori&nbsp;e l&#39;impressione complessiva del prodotto. Acquisto ultra consigliato!!!</p>
