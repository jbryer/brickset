Then, as more pictures emerged, I began to quite like it. I saw the minifigures properly as well as the rest of the set and decided I had to own it. Was it worth it&#39;s very large price tag, though?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is not very tall, or deep. But it is incredibly wide! It features the Transporter in battle with the Resistance soldiers on a mysterious jungle world.<br />
&nbsp;The troopers are disembarking and it looks great! Above is the Star Wars branding and a menacing picture of Kylo Ren. At the bottom is a lineup of all 7 minifigures. Although all of them are brand new, none of them say that next to them. On the back, play features are shown off, along with another image of the set from a different angle, some blueprint style pictures of the set and a box showcasing all the weapons included.</p>

<p>The instructions are one single perfect bound manual, with the main image of the set on the front and some advertisements for other sets in the new Force Awakens range near the end. I found no mistakes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of light bley slopes, plates and a few bricks as well. you get quite a lot for your money, 792 parts for &pound;80 (or $90), but the price could have been lowered. This model is very useful for moccing other Sci-Fi ships thanks to all of it&#39;s grey parts. There are a number of dark bley plates slopes and bricks, but not too many. Significant parts include Captain Phasma&#39;s gun, a nice silver, which, according to this website is called &quot;silver metallic.&quot; It is exclusive and the same colour as Phasma&#39;s armour. You also get that same gun in gun metal grey for the Resistance Soldiers,(2 of them actually) and they are exclusive as well. Other than that, no other parts stand out too much.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Resistance Soldiers: The man has a head which has only appeared in 5 sets so far, it is a frowning face. He also has a dark brown hairpiece which has only appeared in 10 sets so far. His legs and hips are also dark brown and his torso is dark tan with some dark brown straps and pockets printed on to a dark tan jacket. He has a continuation of this design on his back, with more straps. He has no alternate face. The woman has quite common reddish brown hair and a head which is double sided with a frown and a smile. It is exclusive to this set. She has olive green hips and legs and a tan torso printed on both sides with generic looking armour, a belt, and a strap, all on both sides.</p>

<p>The Flametroopers have specialized helmets with some very fine printing, generic &quot;angry clone&quot; faces and very nice armour printing on the front, back, hips, and legs. I&#39;ve not yet seen Flametroopers as they will appear in the film, but I&#39;m sure they&#39;re very accurate. They have cool flamethrower packs on their backs which are attached by the new transparent back plate with two studs (6100958). This has only appeared in 4 sets so far. The Stormtroopers are also exclusive (like all the figs in this set) and they are truly fantastic. I love the design, it is incredibly accurate. Their helmets are brand new, not too big or too small and have some great looking prints on them. They both have &quot;angry clone&quot; heads, armour printing on the front and back of the torso along with the legs and hips.</p>

<p>Captain Phasma, the star of the set, has mostly the same designs as the Stormies, just in metallic silver. Her head is plain black and her armour has a few scratches on it. The cape she wears is cool and accurate, but is a bit of a faf because you have to bend it so it doesn&#39;t stick out from her back too much. It is the old, harder material rather than the soft new one, unfortunately. Her helmet is slightly different, with quite a few light silver lines running across it, which is accurate to the film. She is definitely the best minifigure in the set and will undoubtedly go for extortionate&nbsp; prices when sold alone, because she is an important character.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build starts with the base which has a bit of technic construction, but from then on it is mostly stacking bricks. That isn&#39;t to say the build isn&#39;t enjoyable, however. I learnt a thing or two and it really was fantastic seeing it come together. The build is reasonably long, about right for a set of this size and there are a few cool techniques used. Building the engines and then attaching them was fun, as was constructing the play feature where the trooper is moved upwards and out the top of the ship (more on that later). Throughout the build there are only four stickers to put on. There is only one that you actually need to put on though, and that is the one for the cockpit windshield.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is pretty menacing. It is very large and nicely detailed, too. The interior could have been bare, but it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s actually quite nicely detailed. (Although, on a set of this size we probably should expect a detailed interior). The front door (for want of a better word) has simulated hydraulic rams which look pretty realistic, and I&#39;m glad they were included. The interior is quite big and can probably fit 6 troops with a bit of room to spare. There are also 4 clips on the walls to hold the troopers guns. To access the interior, you can just lift the top off, because it is only attached by two studs. Pulling out a nob at the back (which is dark bley rather than bright red, thank goodness) opens the front of the ship up and pushing it in closes it. A gear on the left hand side of the ship (which also is integrated quite nicely) can be turned and a troop will pop out of the top of the ship, just behind a stud-firing turret. This works quite nicely.</p>

<p>The model however, is a bit too short and the interior could have done with being bigger. The two spring loaded shooters are quite conspicuous as well, but they&#39;re not too bad. It&#39;s also a shame that you can&#39;t have a Stormie manning the turret, in the cockpit and in the troop bay at the same time. (that is discounting Flametroopers, because they wouldn&#39;t be operating it and the troop bay wouldn&#39;t just have Flametroopers in it would it?)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Even with those flaws, this is still a great set. It is accurate, has brand new, all exclusive figures, is an okay price, and the finished model certainly feels worth &pound;80. It is nice and big and bulky and has a lot of useful parts. The fact that this set comes with Resistance Soldiers is good as well, because it means that you can have a battle right out of the box! This set will actually look quite good on a shelf due to all it&#39;s detail and for play it&#39;s great! Kids can unload all the troops, fight the Resistance Soldiers and fly home when the battle gets rough! Captain Phasma, the Stormies and the Flamies are great. Really accurate and collectible. The set has it&#39;s flaws, but if you&#39;re like me and you actually find it interesting to look at, then those flaws are easy to forget. Overall, I think it was worth it&#39;s large price tag and I recommend this set to any and all FOLs looking for a cool, interesting set with epic minifigures! I hope this review was helpful, and told you everything you wanted to know about this set.</p>

"sf1378","2015-10-12T11:31:23.083Z","Theres method in the utilitarian madness...","<p>CapnRex&nbsp;has given a really comprehensive review...but I thought I&#39;d focus on all the griping concerning the visual asesthetics instead...</p>

<p>Visually, the designs in the Star Wars Universe are all about segueing into one another....from the Storm Troopers of Episodes IV, V, VI to the Clone Troopers of Episodes I, II and III...essentially, and I recall this from design books about the vehicles in the Prequels, that was a time of elegance, of craftsmanship...by the time of the Clone Wars, gone was the need for &#39;beauty&#39; and the need for utlitarianism...and by the time of Empire...everything was long forgotten...</p>

<p>Episode VII follows on from this conceit: forget something visually appealling, its just there to do the job...and thats why Kylo Ren&#39;s&nbsp;Command Shuttle, the First Order Transporters and Snow Speeders are, to put it mildly: UGLY as hell...but they get the job done...</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t like it, don&#39;t buy them. If you find them interesting then buy them...</p>

<p>My only personal gripe was Captain Phasma having a blank head...a pity really, but I expect we&#39;ll see &#39;her&#39; in future releases with a more accurate character print head...</p>

<p>Incidentally, I didn&#39;t think its worth &pound;80, I lucked out and bought it&nbsp;for &pound;69.99 for the Transporter and &pound;79.99 for Ren&#39;s Shuttle, a grand total, with free delivery for &pound;147.98...if you can nab them for far cheaper then I&#39;d recommend either...as they are selling for far inflated prices both officially and on the secondary markets...</p>

<p>Its a solid build, extremely playable and chock full of features...</p>

"ThoughtLash","2016-03-08T14:06:57.86Z","For the First Order!","<p>This was my first minifigure-scale&nbsp;<em>The Force Awakens&nbsp;</em>set, and one of my all-time favorite&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>&nbsp;sets.</p>

<p>NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box for this set is huge! It&#39;s a long rectangle, with a battle scene on Takadona, and the basic information/parts count/age warning. I don&#39;t have the instructions with me, but there were no mistakes that I can remember. I don&#39;t believe that they were creased or damaged in any way.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots and lots of grey. There is a large amount of grey plates and tiles, in both light and dark. With the exception of the Technic interior, and all the little orange lights, I would say that most of the parts are the above. Several of these pretty cool smooth, curved plates are included, which are used on the sides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned above, there are also a lot of Technic pieces, which are used to make the gunner&#39;s seat raise and lower. Most of these parts are obscured by the grey plating when the vehicle in constructed.</p>

<p>Two stud shooters are included, which are later used to make cannons. Two spring-loaded missiles and their launches are also included, and can be fired by pressing down on the back of the projectile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, there are also the minifigures&#39; parts, which are very nicely detailed, and several were unique to this set, at the time of release.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>My favorite part of the set, all the minifigs!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with Captain Phasma, my favorite character from TFA (forget that&nbsp;Jacen Solo imposter, seriously, he took his name from a guy in the old&nbsp;<em>Droids</em>&nbsp;cartoon and his look from Darth Revan. He also got owned by a scavenger with no lightsaber training.). She looks awesome, with pearl silver armor printed with the intricate designs. Her helmet is the same mold as the FO Stormtrooper, just in silver with slightly different printing. She wears a black cape, with a red border, which looks great. A silver blaster is included for her, as well. Unfortunately, her head is a plain, black, unprinted head, as we never see her take her helmet off.</p>

<p>The Flametroopers are my second favorite minifgs, with these really cool-looking helmets. Their torsos are similar to the Stormtroopers, although it features less printing, representing the extra armor plates. A neck bracket&nbsp;with two studs is used, which connects to two short lightsaber blade pieces&nbsp;and two cylinders, to represent the backpacks worn by the troopers. They feature the basic &quot;angry clone&quot; head.&nbsp;A blaster rifle is included for each, which has another said white cylinder mounted of the front.</p>

<p>Two First Order Stormtroopers are also included, which is great. As an Imperial/First Order lover, it&#39;s always nice to have more Stormtroopers. They are very nicely printed, although, like the Flametroopers, they use the &nbsp;basic clone heads. A black blaster is included for both.</p>

<p>Finally, the Resistance soldiers. Eh. While they certainly look nice, and it&#39;s nice to have a female soldier, I don&#39;t really like them. I actually used them for parts, although their gunmetal blasters are very cool.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>I build pretty fast, and this took a while. The construction starts with a Technic/System frame, which ends up makes the skeleton of the ship. Next, the engines and side plates are assembled, and mounted, leaving only the top and cockpit. The top is basically one long, flat piece that can be removed, which the cockpit and turret are mounted onto the frame near the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a neat little Technic mechanism that can be used to raise and lower a gunner, into position behind a little cannon mounted on a turntable. Two stud shooters of the brick variety are used as the cannons.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>At a first glance, this set will seem very bland. It is almost all grey, boxy, and just otherwise unappealing. However, it is actually an extremely well designed set. It looks great, is greebled, and has plenty of play features. The gunner&#39;s position is a neat little feature.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I absolutely love this set. It has great minifigs, a great design, and is just plain awesome. My only complaint is the number of minifigures, as I had to get 75132&nbsp;First Order Battle Pack in order&nbsp;to fully crew&nbsp;it.</p>

"ChubsnFlubs","2015-10-13T17:57:01.66Z","Suprisingly Brilliant","<p>When I first saw this set, I&nbsp;thought it would be another overpriced let down. But after reading some reviews, I picked up a set for five pounds cheaper,&nbsp;and immediately fell in love with it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The lengthy box depicts&nbsp;an amazing battle between the First Order army and a band of rebel troops. It really grabs the eye. The back shows the features, parts and some great looking blueprint plans. Inside are six medium sized bags and a small (yes!) sticker sheet. The instruction manual is not divided like others, so is quite thick. Promises a good build.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Every new bag held different parts, which was great to see, as it warns you this set will have detail without the use of many stickers. Good range.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I like it when there are more bad guys in a build. Playability wise this makes it so you can outnumber the heroes, so they&#39;re win is more spectacular. This set offers exactly that. I&#39;ll start with the exclusive Resistance troopers. There are two; a male and a female. Both have nicely detailed outfits, but only the girl has to expressions. One, an inquisitive glance, the other, smiling happily. They both wield slightly chromed guns, which nicely fit the whole look of the resistance fighters. However, the also exclusive First Order troops really steal the show. Both types, normal and flamethrower, show exceptional detail, with awesome helmets and the flamethrowers bulky backpacks. But its really Captain Phasma who steals the show. With a chromed gun and brand new jagged cape this figure is a marvel to look at. Despite having&nbsp;a blank head, the outside detail on this figure is superb, nicely finishing of this array of figures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was nice and long, taking me almost two hours. That may be just me taking ages but hey, it was very enjoyable. I didn&#39;t &nbsp;expect so much technic, and I worried it would be what the set heavily relied on. But its only needed for movement and the pop up feature on the &#39;deck&#39;, and the rest was all structure and design. Even though the set is symmetrical to a point, the build didn&#39;t feel repetitive, and used some great techniques. You may stumble a few times when reading the instructions, but they are not hard to overcome. The stickers were easy to apply, but don&#39;t effect the overall design of the set. Generally an intriguing&nbsp;build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Whether this set is for display or is amongst&nbsp;the other lego on the floor, being played with, this set delivers everything necessary. It is stunning to look at, with slick sides and detailed engines and side...things. It has enough space for all the troops, and more,if&nbsp;you are thinking of adding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any other&nbsp;minifigures to your army. It has an array of projectiles and some cool features, plus it moves so smoothly. The design, both for playing and looking, is spot on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Get this set. If your looking for a good set from the new Star Wars range get this one. At &pound;80 it&#39;s value for money, which is what you want in a set this size. AFOLs and KFOLs alike will adore this set.</p>

"Qwerty7556","2016-05-03T18:33:54.99Z","""We've got company.""","<p>When the LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens line of sets was (accidentally) revealed about a week before Force&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;last year, one of the sets I was most intrigued by was the First Order Transporter--due in no small part to the minifigures. At the time, it was the only set to include First Order Stormtroopers and First Order Flametroopers, and is still has the right to boast of Captain Phasma and two unique Resistance fighters. The vehicle is wonderful too, so is there anything wrong with this set?<br />
<br />
Box/Instructions<br />
<br />
The box is nicely sized with the Transporter being nicely shown off in the forests of Takodana. True, it appears here in the movie, but as it&#39;s more memorable from the village on Jakku perhaps that would have been a more appropriate setting.<br />
<br />
Parts<br />
<br />
Light Bley, Dark Bley, one or two black pieces, and a scattering of various other colors. Yup. That&#39;s about it. No doubt useful for an innovative MOCer.<br />
<br />
Minifigures<br />
<br />
MINIFIGURES!!! Honestly, is there anything wrong with these?<br />
<br />
First Order Stormtrooper (x2)<br />
<br />
These fellows are terrific, completely identical to their on-screen counterparts, and...and...super!<br />
<br />
Con #1: The blasters have some white mixed with the black in the movie, but they still look good.<br />
<br />
First Order Flametrooper (x2)<br />
<br />
Not only are these guys excellent, but their new helmet mold could easily be adapted for the new Shadow Troopers in the upcoming Rogue One: A Star Wars Story!<br />
<br />
Con #1: No cons to speak of here! The blaster coloring issue is fixed here, anyway!<br />
<br />
Captain Phasma<br />
<br />
Gwendoline Christie&#39;s character has a bit of a Boba Fett-like appeal. Though not having much to do (or say) in the movie, the character has become somewhat iconic in the Star Wars universe!<br />
<br />
Con #1: It would have been very nice if she had been chrome-plated like she is in the movie, but, alas, she is not.<br />
<br />
Con #2: There is no face printing on the minifigure head under the helmet.<br />
<br />
Resistance Fighter (Male)<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t recall this particular trooper being in the movie, but since he is so generic he fits in with any LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens scene you could think of.<br />
<br />
Con #1: Not based on a real character.<br />
<br />
Resistance Fighter (Female)<br />
<br />
Looking through all of the various TFA information guides, it appears this minifigure is based on a trooper named Kaydel Ko. If so, the hair is completely inaccurate both in shape and color. Perhaps General Organa&#39;s hair piece in a lighter color would have done the trick...<br />
<br />
The build<br />
<br />
What a build! With all of the various nooks and crannies and details that no one would ever think of looking for (which are great, by the way), this set is constantly full of surprises. I was particularly intrigued by the way that the side-vents were constructed (and also the moving parts). Five Stars!<br />
<br />
The completed model<br />
<br />
Movie Accuracy:<br />
<br />
The most noticeable issue is the size and scale. In the movie, it&#39;s able to fit two squads (20 troopers), but here it can fit maybe 8. That&#39;s more than most sets can boast, however, so actually the interior spacing is fantastic!<br />
<br />
The opening door is wonderful, and the pistons slide along the wall just like they do in the film!<br />
<br />
The stud-/missle-shooters are included for play purposes, but they are easily removable.<br />
<br />
The ship is much looongeer in the movie, but making it any longer would have likely increased the price (it would be approaching the size of 9515-1: Malevolence!). Overall, the accuacy is a good compromise.</p>

<p>LEGO Quality:<br />
<br />
This is wonderful for LEGO&#39;s standards as well. With all of those pieces and gizmos and details, it&#39;s just great!<br />
<br />
Overall opinion<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a great set. Recommended to any Star Wars fan, or just any LEGO fan in general.</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-14T16:08:35.763Z","The Chrome Captain ","<p>First Order Transporter is the third largest set from the inital wave of Force Awakens. It retails for $109.86 CAD, has 729 pcs and 7 figures.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong>:<br />
The build was a fun and overall enjoyable experience. The front has lights on either side and a small one on top. The front ramp opens to reveal the interior and two hydraulic hoses. On top there are two missile shooters as well as two stud shooters. The whole top assembly can be lifted to gain access to the interior. There is enough space to store all the 5 First Order figures included. Also there are 4 clips to hold the accessories.<br />
The top has a control station which can be accessed by lifting a panel on the back of the station. There is a small tray which can be slid out and a figure can be placed. On the other side is a small hatch. A figure can be placed under the hatch. On one side of the vehicle is a knob which can be turned to raise the seated figure, opening the hatch, who can then control the stud shooters.</p>

<p>The sides have very nice greebling done with the use of wing pieces. There is also twin engines located underneath the vehicle with the help of small wheel axles. The back has 4 engines angled at 45 degrees which look cool and intimidating. The only downside is that underneath, a plethora of technic studs are visible. At the back is a small technic piece to pull out dropping the ramp at the front. Underneath the structure are 4 transparent wheels which allow the vehicle to hover and move easily.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
1. Captain Phasma: This figure is awesome! The print detailing is similar to the First Order Stormtrooper except Phasma has flat silver colour and silver lines around the helmet and torso. The figure comes with an exclusive cape cutout in dark red with a red border. The figure does not come with a printed head but a plain black head pc.</p>

<p>2. and 3. First Order Flametrooper: The figure comes with a sleek head mold which has crisp printing around the edges. There are 2 small tubes at the front allowing them to breath during a fire.<br />
4. and 5. First Order Stormtrooper: The figure comes with a new helmet with crips printing just like the Flametrooper. It comes with a simple blaster.</p>

<p>6. Female Rebel Soldier: The figure is cool and comes with an exclusive torso piece consisting of pouches and a bandoleer. She comes with a new pearl dark grey blaster.</p>

<p>7. Male Rebel Soldier: The figure is a nice addition presumably a captain in the Resistance. He comes with a tan torso which has twin rows of pouches on either side. He also comes with pearl dark grey blaster</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>:<br />
I bought this at a fantastic price: 70% off retail because of clearance and it came to $37! This price is fantastic to get the awesome Captain Phasma figure. The build is okay and the figures are fine but Phasma is the real standout for me.</p>

It is great for transporting troops around when you are playing a game, and there&nbsp;is plenty of room inside to hold 8 minifigures comfortably standing up in the main hold and another 2 in the cockpit and gunners compartments. The engines on the back have good detailing.&nbsp;there is also a lever on the back that you pull to lower the ramp, and a knob on the side that lifts the gunner up and out of the ship.</p>

<p>The set comes with 7 minifigures&nbsp;including Captain&nbsp;Phasma 2 Flame troopers, and 2 storm troopers. There is also a man rebel trooper and woman rebel trooper. I really like Phasmas silver armor along with the new storm trooper helmet&nbsp;design and was really happy to get those minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately the there are no new or unique parts as far as I can tell, and the price that I paid of $110 seems expensive for a set of this size.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
