"zswilliams736","2015-12-27T03:14:24.227Z","Great design, but not quite movie accurate","<p>This is my first review so be patient with me. I&#39;m not the best at explaining things. It is also the first big set that I have build in a long&nbsp;while.</p>

<p>Got this set for Christmas after seeing the new movie &quot;The Force Awakens.&quot; It is a really good set, but it is not exactly right when looked at from the movie&#39;s ship. I&#39;ll explain more later.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Medium sized box, smaller than what I&#39;ve gotten for big set in the past. The instructions are straight forward and simple to follow. There are about 150 pages in the booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s nothing to drastic in the parts. A lot of different shades of gray. There are two shooting blocks built into the wings that will fire the green projectiles.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Six in all, including a female First Order Officer. The Kylo Ren figure is interesting. The imprint of his main mask is on his head so he can have his bigger helmet on or the robe hood and still look the part. The lightsaber has the same hilt and only a different blade design.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Really a simple build if instructions can be followed. The set is divided up into six bags. Only took me about three hours to complete. The moving part of the wings is really simple to assemble and really cool to look at. It is mainly just a lot of gray.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set in itself&nbsp;is an impressively sturdy design with plenty of figures to play around with. However, there is only really enough room inside the ship for one pilot and two additional figures. There is also a loading ramp underneath the ship but when the set is set flat on the ground there is not enough room to place the minifigs under upright.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My biggest gripe with this set is the inaccuracy with the movie it comes from. The main difference is that the wings do not fold out. They are supposed to be upright and lowered when it lands, but folded out at angles when it is in flight. The set design as is only puts the wings upright with no fold ability at all. It looks a little funny to me flying with the wings up. Also the lower section of the wing that serves as the landing gear as it is are not present in the movie. There are a few mods that people have done to correct the issues, but I have not tried them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set itself is great. It is only when compared to the movie that it has some flaws that only a few may find disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

</style>
</p>

<p><u><strong>(SPOILER ALERT) - This review includes minor spoilers from Star Wars: The Force Awakens</strong></u></p>

<p><strong>Set:&nbsp;</strong>75104-1: Kylo Ren&#39;s Command Shuttle?<br />
<strong>AUD:&nbsp;</strong>$149 at Myer, and I have seen it as high as $169 at the Lego website.</p>

<p>The Star Wars audience is introduced fairly early on to the fearsome command shuttle of Kylo&nbsp;Ren. Just minutes after the opening crawl, the ship lands during the invasion of Jakku with the quintessential hum of the Star Wars universe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lego set of the shuttle is really no different in that regard. At 40cm high with the wings extended, this set overshadows many of the other sets in my Star Wars Lego collection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As the second-largest set in its release, the command shuttle comes in a substantial box. However, given the height of the ship, the box would be better served taller rather than wider, giving Lego the ability to really sell the height of the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions, as I always find with larger sets, are detailed and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I was really impressed with the number and variety of parts (and the lack of stickers!). For collectors of the pieces, this set is great for the sheer number of flat, angled panels of all different sizes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest, there was one reason everyone (and I include myself in this category) bought this set - Kylo Ren. There was no doubt the new antagonist of the series would be included, and Lego have produced a detailed figure. From the lightsaber with a cross guard to the helmet, the Ren figure is impressive. I only hope later sets will included a face and hair combination, rather than two versions of the mask.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other major figure included in this set is the high-ranking First Order officer General Hux. Hux, who is portrayed at points in the film as Hitler-esque character, comes with an incredible amount of details on the torso and legs (a combination which will prove quite popular). However, I was a little surprised at Hux&rsquo;s inclusion in this over Captain Phasma, who does travel on the shuttle in the film. Phasma&rsquo;s inclusion would make this set ideal for a reconstruction of the invasion of Jakku.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other four minifigures are minor characters. There are two First Order crew members with Daft Punk-style helmets, a female First Order officer (it&rsquo;s exciting to see some diversity in these sets) and a stormtrooper office figure, which even includes a shoulder patch/cape.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I had to shift the set midway between the build, and found it was incredibly mobile if you need to pack up between the build. Overall it took me about three hours to build the set.</p>

<p>The ship is split between six different bags. Builders construct the body of the ship first, then the bulk of the wings separately, then finally the wing tips and the cosmetic additions to the body.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a moment in a Lego construction where the builder comes to realise what the instructions have been building to (pardon the pun). This moment is often characterised by a &ldquo;Ohhhhhhhh, that&rsquo;s what that is&rdquo;, and is honestly one the best parts of using Lego. There is a such a moment in this set when building the hinge device which extends the wings. It works fantastically, and really adds to the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already touched on how great this set looks, and this is heightened by the playability of the set. Despite being quite heavy, it&rsquo;s very easy to fly this set around the room, and makes for hours of fun.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set, I&rsquo;m stoked my partner bought it for me for Christmas and as a seperate Lego set it&rsquo;s a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But as it is part of a much larger universe, we do have to view it through that light. In the film, Ren&rsquo;s ship is black, and I can&rsquo;t help but imagine how much better the set would look in a traditional black.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also a little disappointed that the wings don&rsquo;t fold down, like they do in the film on take off, while the addition of landing flaps not included in the film is bizarre to say the least.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fortunately, AFOL&rsquo;s much more experienced and wiser than I have come up with solutions to all these issues. One such solution is available from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikk-egNrnXw"">JANGBRiCKS</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the cost or the collection needed to be able to completely re-colour the ship leads me to think Lego might want to work closer with Disney and the franchise ahead of the next film release.&nbsp;</p>

"modernpoika","2016-01-16T18:52:48.853Z","The biggest First Order set thus far...","<p>At the very beginning i want to say sorry if my english isn&#39;t perfect all the time, it isn&#39;t my main language and this is my first review so it might not be the best. Let&#39;s start:</p>

<p>So i am reviewing the biggest First Order set thus far: Kylo Ren&#39;s Command Shuttle. I got it for a little under&nbsp;100&euro; which is the main reason why i bought it. Now i&#39;m really liking it, even though it has a couple of problems.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Thr box is pretty big with very good looking art behind it. Front doesn,t look as good, mainly because the wings should be in a flying position, but sadly you can&#39;t do that with the lego without modding it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set has a total of 1005 parts, mostly dark bluish gray and Light bluish gray. There were some pretty unique looking parts but mostly they weren&#39;t anything special.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There were 6 minifigures in total. The most interesting one is of course Kylo Ren. He has an unique cape and&nbsp;head which represents his helmet which is meant for hood,&nbsp;and then there is normal helmet. Head print looks phenomenal with hood, and the helmet looks pretty good even though it is pretty big. Lighstaber hilt is normal&nbsp;dark gray, but the lightsaber itself is a new piece which represents&nbsp;Kylo Ren&#39;s new lighstaber and i think it does its job very well. Then there&#39;s new Stormtrooper with orange pauldron, and i really like the way these new First Order Stormtroopers look like, even as a lego. Then there Is General Hux who looks ok, two First Order Crew Members which look kinda weird (not legos fault) and First Order female General.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building the middle part was very pleasing because it used a couple of nice Building techniques and it didn&#39;t have many x2 builds. The wings however, as expected were very repetitive. They were still pretty unique because rarely you get to build wings this big.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Now we get to the most interesting part. The ship itself looks very good, with nice little details and such, but it isn&#39;t very movie accurate. In the movie&nbsp;ship was mainly Black, but this is mainly dark bluish gray. This isn&#39;t very big problem in my opinion but the bigger problem is the wings which should be able fold out in to flying position. They don&#39;t do that, but luckily there is a couple of good and easy tutorials on youtube&nbsp;how to mod the wings. This has the ability to move wings up and down which i really like, and it has small flaps under the wings which aren&#39;t in the movie but look good. It has pretty nice sized interior which i like, you can put 3 figures in comfortable positions and maybe put fourth in very uncomfy position. It has a good looking loading ramp too, but the ship is just a little too close to ground to fit a minifigure in there. But i really like how the interior looks like.&nbsp;Oh yeah, and there is zero&nbsp;stickers!!!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like the set even though it is not 100% movie accurate. After i modded the wings i really started to like the set a lot more because it looks so much better in flying mode. Minifigures are great, one of the best ones from the first TFA wave, nice amount of different features and good looking interior. The price imo is a little too high, but if you can find it for 100&euro; or under i really recommend this set.</p>

"Dexterzol","2016-09-12T20:12:06.24Z","A worthy successor to the Imperial shuttle.","<p>So I bought this as what some might descibe as a clearance sale (Written in September 2016), although I was keeping my eyes on it for a few months</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>The box art is your standard vehicle Star Wars one, with explosions and shots in the background. The box itself is tall and wide, but not particularily thick, which made carrying it around easier.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is&nbsp;a lot of grey, black and light grey in this set, not much variety in color, but fitting for this type of build. Kylo Ren&#39;s lightsaber&nbsp;hilt is useful in multiple areas. There aren&#39;t that many printed parts, outside of a few control panels.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Kylo Ren</strong>: A great first rendition of an already well-designed character. The mask is very detailed, as is the brand new cape. The torso and legs are unique, but not so different from that of other First Order minifigs. The head printing really does the design of the mask justice.</p>

<p><strong>General Hux</strong>: Fine minifigure, the First Order general&#39;s hat is great as usual, the torso is an unique design, and makes him stand out from the other FO higher-ups. The printed sideburns are great, but look a bit awkward without any surrounding hair.</p>

<p><strong>First Order Officer</strong>: It&#39;s nice to have another officer in this set, especially one with a different color scheme. The hat looks especially good in dark grey. It&#39;s also nice to get a female officer for once.</p>

<p><b>First Order Stormtrooper Officer</b>: Identical in most ways to the average FO Stormtrooper, which, admittedly, is a stellar minifig made better by a unique red shoulder pauldron.&nbsp;He still has the generic &quot;angry Clone Trooper&quot; face, which could have been more unique for an unique minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>First Order Crew</strong>: Whew, a lot of &quot;First Orders&quot; in this. Anyway, this is basically the same minifigure that is seen in other sets, which are of a unique, although a bit plain design. Thankfully, the two crew-members do have different skin colors and head prints.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t that challenging considering the piece count. A few unusual techniques are used to give the ship it&#39;s shape, and there is quite a bit of Technic sections to keep the model sturdy, and to make certain features work. The only challenging part I can think of is getting the wings to lock together, which is quite tricky to do with only Technic parts partially covered by plates and bricks. I enjoyed myself while building it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is best described as tall. It&#39;s just really tall. The cockpit section is very spacious, and you can fit approximately five minifigs in it, though the First Order Crew figs take up a bit more space. The cockpit is easily my favourite part of the ship, it could even pass for a whole ship without the wings. The wings themselves are quite nice, on both sides, but some Technic parts stick out a little bit.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is really great from a display standpoint, and despite that, is still easy to play with. The minifigures are great, with the stars being Kylo Ren and General Hux. It has quite a high piece count for a set of this price, with many sets that cost more having below 1,000 pieces. The small touches here and there, all achieved without a single sticker are simply great.</p>

"SithLordMorte_","2017-03-06T21:51:43.69Z","Worth the money","<p>This set is overall one of my favorite Force Awakens sets, from the folding wings and control panel in the cockpit, to the mini-figures, including Kylo Ren.</p>

<p>The fact that you get general Hux really adds to the value of the set, and you also get 2 First Order technicians. You also get a First Order officer, which is not available in any other set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wings fold up and down like in the film, but sadly to do not fold out. I think that if they had added that last detail, I would&#39;ve given it 5&nbsp;stars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the inside of the ship there is not very much room, but like I mentioned,&nbsp;it does have a control panel for the pilot, and a ramp that leads down onto the battle field/docking station.</p>

<p>Overall, this set has satisfied me on most of the crucial points, but a few more adjustments would&#39;ve made this set perfect. This is my opinion, and if you buy this set you will not regret it.</p>

"Areedman2000","2017-08-18T16:00:04.273Z","Kylo Ren's attack shuttle.. disappointing.","<p>Got lucky and found this at my local Wal-Mart on clearance for $30. So that in itself, i considered a win for me! However, when i finished assembling this set i found myself a bit disappointed in what i was looking at. It seems to be a little drab or something. hard to put my finger on what it&#39;s missing. &nbsp;My chief complaint with this set is the fact that the wings do not fold out to the (30* or 40*) angle like they do in the movie when it&#39;s in flight mode. I was looking forward to displaying it in my collection with it in that position. &nbsp;In the end tho, it is a pretty good sized ship and (as always) i enjoyed putting it together. For the $30... was well worth it. Not worth the $109 retail price tho.</p>
