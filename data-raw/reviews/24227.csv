<p>Great kit to build, as I said above, it is not the UCM Millennium Falcon (10179) :(</p>

<p>Was waiting for new sets to come out, been a bit lean of late on Star Wars kits... I got the UCM Tie Starfighter&nbsp;week back.. This Millennium Falcon was actually more fun to build</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box and instructions were like most boxes and instructions. Just the one book, got used to one book of late. Not a hugely technical build, so instructions were sweet</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No real amazing parts per se. Cool to see more dark grey, generally MF&#39;s have been more of the one grey colour, liking the rectangle radar on top...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Really loving the mini figures, younger PL, Chewie is great, when is he not....</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build was enjoyable, guess took some 4 hours, was cruising it really. Very much like the mechanism smoothness of the front section</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great model, very enjoyable to build and feed ones Star Wars Lego addiction. Another model for the office...</p>

"Derfel","2015-09-13T22:49:26.14Z","My first Falcon","<p>75105:&nbsp; This is the first Millennium Falcon set I&#39;ve&nbsp;owned, I&rsquo;ve been kicking my heels waiting to pick up a 10179 UCS Falcon or the real thing depending on which is cheapest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m now at that age where neither seem likely so in a JJ Abrams induced impulse I bought the latest hunk of junk.</p>

<p>Many people have commented on the obvious DNA link with the 7965 Falcon, but as I never got to own one, this will hopefully be a fresh take on LEGO&rsquo;s biggest, swooshable, Corellian transport.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Capacious and full of pieces. I like the Kylo-Ren figure looming over each set, which really sets it apart from other Star Wars sets and firmly roots it in Episode VII.&nbsp; On a set this iconic and big I shouldn&rsquo;t expect optional build pictures, but still I miss them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Instructions were clear with very little going backwards and forwards&nbsp;to work out what&rsquo;s gone wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of big pieces 1x16 technic beams, 8x16 plates.&nbsp; The stickers are a good quality, but when you compare them to the beautifully printed Dejarik chess board they look second rate.&nbsp; I built the entire model without them at first and I can&rsquo;t say it was any the worse for it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Old Han and new Chewie are the stars of this bundle.&nbsp; Chewie has strangely dead eyes, but the new bowcaster is a hoot.&nbsp; When tested against the classic 1x1 stud gun it was far more accurate and longer ranged, looks great.</p>

<p>This is a pre-cinematic release review, so I&rsquo;ve no idea how Rey and Finn fit into the Falcon&rsquo;s story. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve seen Finn pull off a Stormtrooper uniform, get hauled off the ground by Rey and shot at by just about everything that moves, so he&rsquo;s obviously busy, but he and the mysterious Rey aren&rsquo;t quite Star Wars canon yet.</p>

<p>As a result their minifigs seemed generic.&nbsp; I imagine this will change with the cinematic release and these minifigs could become quite desirable. &nbsp;The two thugs are&nbsp;like Rey and Finn, beautifully printed and not devoid of character but even more generic.</p>

<p>BB-8 was a disappointment.&nbsp; The main body is too big or&nbsp;the head too small and too squashed.&nbsp; The stud on his head and large stud connector on the bottom re-enforce&nbsp;the image of it being out of scale and somewhat not right.&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;s going to be a huge hit, I think a new or adapted mold for the head at least would have made him better.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Took me about four hours spread over two days.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t wait to get back to the half finished model which is all you can ask for.&nbsp; Large rounded shapes are usually the preserve of serious MOC&rsquo;ers or artists, this being the first one I had built, it was very interesting and very effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are lots of little bits that in themselves are nothing but enable the design of the central saucer section.&nbsp; I learnt something about the little touches that give LEGO sets that knock of quality.</p>

<p>A few parts of the build felt rushed &ndash; the cockpit, underside and interior especially.&nbsp; With the interior, opportunities for modification&nbsp;abound, but the cockpit felt like a cheap and boring option and the underside felt unfinished.</p>

<p>The gun turrets.&nbsp; Why have a pair of upstairs/downstairs seats for the gunners and no windows to see your heroes in action?&nbsp; If the large circular plate on which the guns sit, had been made from clear trans it could have had a window printed on it, just like the cockpit.&nbsp; It would have really bought something to the build and overall model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a look at previous incarnations and envied the quarter-circle, top and bottom pieces on the first 7190 Falcon.&nbsp; At 10x10 they look a bit too small, but with some widening of the elegant front ramp and docking bays&nbsp;they could have done this model proud.&nbsp; I would have preferred a removable roof, and seven landing legs.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really enjoyed the build, however the final model isn&rsquo;t one I&rsquo;d display or keep together very long.&nbsp;&nbsp; The front mandibles are too small and the docking ports have lost their outer ring and the model looses something as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some good greebling and SNOT techniques especially around the cockpit extension could have been extended to the ring sections. &nbsp;The new radar looks better than the old one, may I be struck down for that.&nbsp;&nbsp; However the cockpit ruins the model and the rear half of the ship feels empty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I understand why the saucer top had to be designed as it was, and I don&rsquo;t mind the gaps, but it makes it very hard to play with the interior.&nbsp; My kids tried for a while but ended up closing them as small arms had to reach a long way to access the main playing deck.&nbsp; &nbsp;Much of the play value was lost.</p>

<h3>Score</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to use Brickset&rsquo;s format for continuity but will add my own LEGO standard, the 4x4 system.</p>

<p>The first 4 concern&nbsp;how many building phases you had&nbsp;to go through: &nbsp;1) first build, according to the instructions;&nbsp; 2) rebuild and try to improve it;&nbsp; 3) rebuild because you have to improve it; &nbsp;4) give up and turn it into a spaceship.</p>

<p>The second 4 concern&nbsp;how you keep it:&nbsp; 1) a thing of beauty, put it on display and disassemble only if absolutely necessary;&nbsp; 2) disassemble carefully to enjoy putting it back together;&nbsp; 3) disassemble to work-in improvements as required; &nbsp;&nbsp;4) disassemble and turn it into parts for a spaceship.</p>

<p>For example: 21108, Ghostbuster&rsquo;s Ecto-1 was an almost perfect 1x1, turning 1x2; &nbsp;7140, X-Wing was a fun 2x3 that turned into a 2x1; &nbsp;7754 Home One was a good for parts 4x4. &nbsp;&nbsp;My system is based on the premise that even the worst set in original configuration was a good source of spares and ideas, therefore a good kick for the imagination.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This was an absorbing 2x3, it requires substantial re-build to make it work as a display model and has inspired me to develop it further.&nbsp; &nbsp;That&rsquo;s most of what I want from a LEGO set so I can&rsquo;t complain.</p>

<p>I can though.&nbsp; In the final stages I felt that less would have been more in this set.&nbsp; Forget about making the whole Falcon, this one isn&rsquo;t really that swooshable for anyone smaller than medium adult,&nbsp;half the interior is a rather sparse engine/cargo/sleeping room where little of the action takes place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A more desirable set might have been just the cockpit, tunnel to the ramp, hideaway and gun turrets, joined to the crew area, all in true minifig scale.&nbsp; It could be the start of&nbsp;a fantastic full Falcon display model, bought in installments or MOC&rsquo;d to measure, which would rival the UCS.&nbsp; On it&rsquo;s own it would still look great and offer more play opportunities.</p>

<p>And have seven landing legs.&nbsp;</p>

Here you&rsquo;ll find a lot of plates and technic bricks for creating the framework of the ship. There is a lot of repetition here and I suggest building this on a hard surface so that the bricks won&rsquo;t spin around so much making pressing the plates down to solidify the base of the ship less difficult.</span></span></span></span></p>

Some stickers are used here for detailing, but the game table piece is a brand new printed element. Or at least brand new to myself, I&rsquo;m certain it&rsquo;s been seen in past Falcon releases, I&rsquo;ve never actually owned a Falcon before now to verify that.</span></span></span></span></p>

Han and Chewbacca join the fun as you work to finish up most of the internal detailing with bag 3. It&rsquo;s a very quick build, pay close attention to the instructions though as you build, it seems that the more you add on the greater the chances of missing a piece and where it is properly placed, especially if you&rsquo;re rushing to complete everything so you can get the Falcon done to play with.</span></span></span></span></p>

Many of the steps will feel repetitive as you work on the sides, this is to be expected as it is a uniform design. The cockpit area is simple enough to work on and there shouldn&rsquo;t be any tricky moments while building here. It should be noted there has been a smattering of sticker usage for detailing throughout the build so far, if necessary seek assistance when placing the stickers.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s not much else to say here, aside from some assistance may be required when putting the blue tube/hyperdrive engine indicator thing together.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s where the theoretical escape pods on the Falcon were always meant to go. This section of the build is fairly straight forward, and doesn&rsquo;t have too many repetitive sections compared to the previous bag. The build is quick, at least thirty minutes to work or so and some more of the stickers are used here at last. With so few uses I&rsquo;m surprised some of these weren&rsquo;t just printed honestly.</span></span></span></span></p>

Basically you&rsquo;re making the four landing struts, the two quad cannons and the rest of the sides for the cockpit entrance doorway on the outside of the ship. All of these little builds are fairly simple and straight forward, nothing here will trip you up while you&rsquo;re building, aside from the part where you need to remember to fold one side panel a certain way so it will go in properly. Not much to discuss either other than that, so one to the next part.</span></span></span></span></p>

Almost every piece of the top of the Falcon is found in this bag and there is a lot of repeat steps as you build doubles and quadruples of elements to attach to the Falcon. There are no real tricky parts in this build. There is a lot of stickers for detailing though and I definitely caution you to pay attention to the placement as indicated in the manual, I had to peel off and reattach two stickers because I failed to notice they were meant to go on differently. Other than that everything should be simple to follow along with.</span></span></span></span></p>

It can be easy to miss one of the pieces as the detailing of the ship can get very busy as you start building up the layers for each section. Especially considering how many plates are used in short order. Other than that I don&rsquo;t believe there are any other issues to be concerned about during the build.</span></span></span></span></p>

So I&rsquo;m not even going to try, what I will say about this model is that is a very solid looking Corellian YT-1300 Freighter. Even featuring flick-fire style missile launchers is well handled, these are the newer type which you press down to fire and they are in the nose section, integrated into the build quite well. This is the only play feature that is action oriented.</span></span></span></span></p>

The two quad cannons are built up quite nicely and rotate to target enemy fighters. The landing gear can go up and down and everything is designed to open up from the top on hinges which are staggard so you can gain access to the interior and all of the areas there. You&rsquo;ll find smuggler&rsquo;s compartments, a Dejarik table, a computer screen and control area, engine section and crew sleeping area with two beds.</span></span></span></span></p>

There are a few cheats, the boarding ramp can raise and lower no problem, but the cockpit area is only capable of seating one or two Minifigures and is lacking in much of the detailing the UCS model incorporated. As that model was bigger and had more space for the cockpit I can definitely see why this is necessary to capture the likeness of the model.</span></span></span></span></p>

She is represented well in this&nbsp;Lego version.</p>

<p>This is the 8th Version of the Falcon in different&nbsp;sizes and the first big one I own, I&#39;ve also got the Microfighter version (Set 75030) but of course this is completely&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>The set comes in one of the larger boxes, 1329 pieces separated&nbsp;into 12 bags which are numbered 1 to 9, a couple of the bags have more bags per number i.e 5 &amp; 8. The instruction manual is a small book, 160+ pages, I&#39;m glad Lego are moving away from multiple instruction books for the sets. There is also a small sheet of stickers,&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set comes with 7 figures, BB-8, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Finn, Rey and 2 members of the Kanjiklub&nbsp;including Tasu Leech, Chewy has a new look bowcaster, and Han has aged the 30 years&nbsp;with his grey hair, Rey and Han are my personal favorite&nbsp;figures in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is good, it took me approximate&nbsp;7 hours to complete on and off, im sure others could build quicker if wanted, You start from the base of the ship upwards, building the floor of the ship first, and the interior before the sides of the craft then the top, the front and cockpit are last.</p>

<p>I was left disappointed with the undercarriage&nbsp;and the cockpit. First the undercarriage, its simple in my opinion to simple, it is fixed in its place, does not retract, It would be nice on a set this size if it could at least fold away, The cockpit, can fit 2 figures just, but the main covers are just 2 pieces that are fixed over, and attached to the craft.</p>

<p>Overall, the model looks good, there is a good variety&nbsp;of figures, it has playability and is an asset&nbsp;to any Star Wars Lego Collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please bare in mind, due to the surface space it takes up a larger amount of room than other sets, which could cause a problem when storing</p>

<p>Enjoy the set</p>

"apcsb","2016-08-10T17:41:30.527Z","A mixed bag","<p>I am writing this review understanding that there&#39;s been tons of others, including video reviews. So I&#39;ll try not to repeat others, but add something new.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Museo Slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>I found the box reasonably big: big enough to look exciting but not too empty.&nbsp;I love the new Lego boxes - one can finally fold them easily for storage!</p>

<p>Instructions are one huge book with good print quality. Colours&nbsp;can be distinguished easily. Stickers are numbered.</p>

<p>The problem though is that for the main bulk on the body instead of the modular approach the instruction follow the layered approach. I.e. instead of creating one sub-assembly and attaching it (like the central turret&nbsp;well) you build it layer by later along with dozen of other things across the whole ship, and some things are even split between bags for no reason. Also, there&#39;s quite a few of unnecessary turning&nbsp;around - flipping the model back and forth to add parts that may have been safely added at previous steps. All this makes the build a lot longer and a lot more tedious&nbsp;than&nbsp;it should be, hence 3 for building experience.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get 1300+ parts which seems more than enough to build just about anything. However,&nbsp;if you key it into Rebrickable, even using &quot;Ignore colours&quot; there isn&#39;t surprisingly a single other Lego set you can build out of it! I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s Lego protecting their interests or just a coincidence given the unique design of the ship, but it&#39;s something to be aware of.</p>

<p>Then, most of those 1300+ parts (minifigs and their accessories aside) are quite common.</p>

<p>There is just one unique part: The hologram board&nbsp;http://brickset.com/parts/6127398</p>

<p>Some parts are &quot;kind of&quot; unique (shared with the previous 7965) Falcon. They are the cockpit and the engine&nbsp;parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4631480</li>
	<li>http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4631449</li>
	<li>http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4631648 (<em>this one is also present in Mindstorms EV3 expansion set, but that&#39;s not something that you&#39;ll find on shelf stores</em>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not too many rare parts (&lt; 10 sets)</p>

<ul>
	<li>5 sets, all of them Star Wars:&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4629798. This one is actually quite interesting, 3 of 5 sets are Falcons and the remaining 2 are Droid Escape Pods. :)</li>
	<li>5 sets&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4625582. 3 of 5 are Falcons again, and other are also &gt;$100 sets. This part is not cheap on BrickLink, costing $1+ at the moment of writing this review. You get 2.</li>
	<li>7 sets: http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6074890 , but pretty cheap.</li>
	<li>7 sets&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6101254 costing $40 or more. Not a cheap part.</li>
	<li>8 sets&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6122047. This one is surprisingly expensive given it&#39;s size and design!</li>
	<li>8 sets:&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6003058</li>
</ul>

<p>Runner-ups:</p>

<ul>
	<li>10 sets:&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4509914. Also not a cheap part mostly used in expensive sets (Creator Expert, UCS)</li>
	<li>10 sets:&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4667578. Was surprised to see it being that rare and appearing mostly in expensive sets (only 3 sets below $60)</li>
	<li>11 sets:&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4268343</li>
	<li>13 sets:&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6048848</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, it feels like it can be relatively easily rebricked&nbsp;(but I have yet to learn to check the full price if the set on BrickLink) if you have many other StarWars sets, especially the 7965.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve bought it on eBay for ~40% of RRP (new w/o figures). I see new mint ones regularly discounted on Amazon and eBay, as well as lots of them being sold w/o figures for less than half price.</p>

<p>Thus,&nbsp;I guess, people don&#39;t put much value into the RRP. Hence the 3.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I had this set w/o the minifigs. But looks like they cost more than everything else in the set. :)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is good, but see my note on the instructions. It almost feels as they wanted to make the process longer, hiding repetitiveness of symmetry with layered design. You have to be careful and not run ahead of the train, and some seemingly &quot;repetitive&quot; parts have small variations and you end up missing pieces (because you used them where they did not belong).&nbsp;There&#39;s some amount of SNOT, hinging and bracing, but nothing really special. I liked the number of pieces per bag, but the logic of splitting the build between bags escapes me (see the note about instructions again).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model is pleasantly big and sturdy. Turned out to be bigger than I expected!</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Resembles the original.</li>
	<li>Easy access to (most of) the insides.</li>
	<li>Loved the rotating cockpit tunnel roof</li>
	<li>The front plate actually looks very natural in the lowered (open) position.</li>
	<li>Can be pretty easily rebuilt into the original trilogy state (i.e. clean up the mess inside)</li>
</ul>

<p>Things that should/may be improved, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Folding chassis and do something with the boarding ramp height. Currently the boarding ramp is&nbsp;too low for the&nbsp;minifig to enter.</li>
	<li>Opening roof and arches between the docking rings and central well&nbsp;for full inside access</li>
	<li>Redesign the guns so that they don&#39;t&nbsp;look so lame when raised</li>
	<li>Cover the bottom!&nbsp;Looks awful from the below!&nbsp;It&#39;s a spaceship! Front, rear and side views are also not too good. Basically, any angle lower than the one in the promo pic reveals ugly internals. I am considering adding 1-2 studs to the height on the bottom area. That should also help with the chassis and the ramp&nbsp;w/o breaking the looks of the ship drastically.</li>
	<li>Implement cargo hatch in the front, maybe with a small lift?</li>
	<li>The front loading arms (AKA &quot;Mandibles&quot;) are a bit to small and should be a bit wider.&nbsp;Bit as of now I&#39;m unsure if this is a major issue. In fact, even googling&nbsp;for&nbsp;Millennium Falcon images on the Internet shows slightly different geometries.</li>
	<li>Improve the design of the docking rings. I like the ones of 7965 much more.</li>
	<li>Tidy up that mess inside!</li>
	<li>Fill that empty&nbsp;gap between the loading arms with concussion missiles that belong there! I&#39;m actually thinking of moving the spring shooters there and hiding their tails in the cargo compartment (which is supposed to have opening hatch for access from below)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For ~40% of it&#39;s RRP I think it&#39;s a good set :) But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth the full price unless you totally want all of the the minifigs.&nbsp;As with most other Lego sets the instructions look dumb, the build is illogical at times, and the finished model&nbsp;feels unfinished and just screams &quot;improve me&quot;. I don&#39;t know if they do it on purpose but I like it (<em>just the improvement part of it</em>)! :)</p>

"Koot","2017-12-31T05:07:16.04Z","LEGO Star Wars 75105 Millennium Falcon","<p>In 2015, we got a very anticipated set: the Millennium Falcon. This set features the large ship and 7 minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>The Model/s:</strong></p>

<p>This Millennium Falcon differs from the 2011 variant with details making it more accurate to Star Wars - The Force Awakens; The satellite has changed, and inside there are a lot of random pieces (representing junk) from the previous owners. Besides these details, the structure is almost completely the same, and the part count has not changed much.</p>

<p>Like the older version, the model opens op and you can access a fairly large play area with all of the furnishing and whatnot the Millennium Falcon is known for having. The interior has many stickers, but on a positive note, the &#39;chessboard&#39;-like game board piece has been given a new print and on a shield part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was straightforward and very enjoyable, and took about 2 hours.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>In this set you get the exclusive Han Solo, Tasu Leech and Kanjiklub&nbsp;Gang member, and the non-exclusive Rey, BB-8, Chewbacca and Finn. Although&nbsp;Tasu Leech and the Kanjiklub&nbsp;Gang member are exclusive, they get fairly little screen time and are pretty useless.</p>

<p>I am starting to get used to the new Chewie print, but I am not surprised if you haven&#39;t. Rey and BB-8 are quite common, so I&#39;d say overall the minifigures are pretty mediocre.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>This set has many nice play features and does look quite good on display, but I would not recommend it to someone who has the 2011 version - there isn&#39;t much new. But if you don&#39;t have the older version, this is definitely a good set and very worth getting for the price.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and I hope this was very helpful.</p>

So when I saw this set come out for Episode VII, I knew I had to have it. It is a very well detailed and fun set to have. As Han Solo would said &quot;She doesn&#39;t look like much, but she&#39;s got it where it counts.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b><span style=""font-size:13.5pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">The front of the box portrays the Millennium Falcon flying to the left evading blasters and explosions. The Kanjiklub gang members follow in pursuit as Rey and Finn man the controls. The back shows more details and play features, including the detailed interior, with Han, Chewbacca, and Finn walking around the navigational computer and hyper-drive. Rey and BB- 8 are just outside, battling the gun-toting gang members. The back also displays the various blasters and accessories in the set including a stud shooting bowcaster. The play features are on the right side which include the rotating manned turrets, the smuggler&#39;s storage compartments, the new blaster pieces in the front, and the lowering loading ramp. The instruction&#39;s cover is the same as the front box image and consists of over 100 steps printed on light grey pages.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b><span style=""font-size:13.5pt"">Parts</span></b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">There are some very nice parts in this set, including some good parts greeble detailing. There are also a large number of angled parts creating the roof of the hull and the extending wing tips. This set also has various circular parts, flex tubes, and so many clip joints throughout. It also has a printed domed shield with a printed game of Dejarik on it.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b><span style=""font-size:13.5pt"">Minifigures</span></b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">There are a spectacular group of minifigures that are included, all with great details and cool accessories. You also get a good number of them as well, with six figures and a BB-8 droid, which only appears in one other set of this current wave of Episode VII sets.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b>Han Solo</b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">Han is back and ready for action! Of course, he aged quite a bit since his last on screen adventures. The minifigure portrays this well, giving him a few wrinkles on his face and grey hair. One side of his face has a confident smirk, while the other is more serious with a slight grimace. He wears a leather jacket over a white collared shirt. The jacket is loaded with detail pockets and creases. His pants are printed with a belt by his torso and his legs are detailed holster strap to carry his ever dependable blaster.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b>Chewbacca </b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">Hey, Chewie is back too, and due to Wookie anatomy, he hasn&#39;t aged as drastically. His legs are printed with tan fur over his solid brown lower body. His torso is completely brown, but that&#39;s ok, since it is completely cover by his head piece. This piece is textured to look like Wookie hair and is printed a loaded shoulder strap with silver details, dark eyes and mouth, teeth, and tan fur around his face. His stud launching bowcaster not only looks cool, it works well and is easily the most fun accessory in the set.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b>Finn</b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">Finn is one of the new heroes of the sequel trilogy, and his minifigure counterpart is a fine addition to anyone&rsquo;s Star Wars collection. His face is double sided, one serious, one with his mouth slightly open almost in a state of shock. His jacket is orange in color and raps around a dark black shirt. The front has some red near the shoulders as well as some buckles, pockets, and straps. The back is printed too, with marks indicating the flow of the jacket. His pants are solid black and he carries a medium blaster.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b>Rey</b> </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">One of the new stars of the latest episode, Rey also is well detailed. She is exactly the same as the one in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75099-1/Rey-s-Speeder""><span style=""color:blue"">75099: Rey&#39;s Speeder</span></a>. Her face has both a happy and serious expression, both having some freckles on her cheeks. Her hair is new, with three buns flowing in a row down the back of her head. Her torso has a tan clothes that crosses over a gray shirt and continues over her shoulders and down her back and down the front of her legs. The clothes is strapped with a light brown strap. She wields a shining silver blaster.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b>The Kanjiklub Gang</b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">This set comes with two gang members, including wht seems to be the leader: Tasu Leech. His face dual sided with a serious and angry expression. His hair is similar to Qui-Gon Jinn in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75058-1/MTT""><span style=""color:blue"">75058</span></a><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75058-1/MTT""><span style=""color:blue"">: MTT</span></a> but in black. His torso looks like some sort of armor strapped on with gold buckles on the back. The front has gray details and a brown belt with pockets and a silver buckle with black sleeves. His pants are primarily black with brown printings on his thighs. He holds a simple brown pistol commonly found in pirate themed sets.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">His fellow gang member has an eye patch that covers the upper part of his face. His hat is solid black and similar to the knit capes of the skier and one of the skateboard kids from the collectible minifigures. Torso is very well detailed with a dark gray shirt with brown swirls throughout. Brown straps that continue from his front to his legs and his back hold pockets and holsters for various weapons. His sleeves are dark brown with black gloves which hold his brown rifle. His pants are dark brown.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b>BB-8</b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">Oh yes, the cute little BB-8 droid. He consists of two parts with primarily orange and silver printed decals. Small marks of red and blue lighten up the droid and the ever changing silver marking surrounded by orange circles capture the looks of the real thing. He really does look good in LEGO form.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b><span style=""font-size:13.5pt"">The build</span></b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">Overall, the build was very fun and had some great techniques.&nbsp; It all starts on a solid technic reinforced frame with plates connected on the top.&nbsp; On the plates lie all the impressive interior details seen throughout the films from the hyper-drive to the Dejarik table and chairs to the two beds and even the smuggler&rsquo;s secret compartment (made with a hinge piece on the deck and an immersed wall connected from the bottom with sideways building).&nbsp; The center is kept hollow to accommodate the turret function, which I find to one of the coolest features of the set.&nbsp; The walls are constructed using clips joints and sideways building.&nbsp; This part is well done, but can seem repetitive because the process is basically repeated four times.&nbsp; Inside these parts, greeble details are added.&nbsp; On these walls more clips are placed and on this clips the roof plates are connected.&nbsp; This allows them to be folded out to play inside.&nbsp; This sideways building on sideways building was fun to construct, but was repetitive because the roofing plates are primarily the same design. &nbsp;Once there in place, more space detailing with engine parts and vents as well as the satellite really improve the overall look. &nbsp;The wings at the fronts are connected through technic pins and are inverts of each other.&nbsp; Designed with many wing plates and more greeble elements, its primary purpose is to hold the missile launching device.&nbsp; The cockpit is built from the main platform and is detailed with sideways building to get its slick shape.&nbsp; The glass, too, is connected by sideways building and rests over an only four stud long extension made with some plates.&nbsp; With a cockpit this small, it only fits one comfortably, but two can fit if one minifigure is placed closer to the front and the other slightly behind.</span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b><span style=""font-size:13.5pt"">The completed model</span></b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">When it is all said and done, this is an extremely well made set with lots of play features.&nbsp; The details on the inside and out are spectacular.&nbsp; There are so many play features throughout the model.&nbsp; This include the loading ramp, the smuggler&rsquo;s secret compartment, the folding roof to play inside, the launching missiles, and rotating turrets, which opens and houses a platform that slides in and out so two people can man the cannons.&nbsp; However, the landing gear is extremely inadequate at doing anything but holding the vessel slightly off the ground.&nbsp; They do not retract, which is pretty normal for this type of LEGO models, but their main issue is that they are not tall enough for the minifigures to walk up the access ramp.&nbsp; They are easily the most disappointing part of the set.&nbsp; Besides that, this set is fantastic and is decent size too, measuring 18 inches long by 12.5 inches wide and about 4.5 inches tall. </span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">Pros:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Well detailed and good size</span></li>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Cool building techniques including many sideways building techniques</span></li>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Secret smuggler&rsquo;s compartment (fits one minifigure comfortably)</span></li>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Interior details include navicomputer, Dejarik table and chairs, hyper-drive, two beds, and boxes and storage details</span></li>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Folding access ramp</span></li>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Two missile launchers</span></li>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Two turrets on the top and bottom that can be manned by two minifigures via a sliding plate</span></li>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Six great and well-designed minifigures</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">Cons:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Landing gear doesn&rsquo;t retract and are too short</span></li>
	<li><span style=""line-height:normal"">Cockpit may be to small</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal""><b><span style=""font-size:13.5pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></span></p>

<p><span style=""line-height:normal"">This Millennium Falcon does not disappoint.&nbsp; It is a fantastic set and a great addition to the Star Wars collection.&nbsp; The minifigures are spectacular, the play features are enjoyable, and details are incredible.&nbsp; I highly recommend this set to Star Wars fanatics, especially for those missing the Millennium Falcon from their collection or those excited for the new sequel trilogy.&nbsp; Overall, I give a 9/10.&nbsp; Its only fault is its landing gear, which do not retract and their height also makes the entrance ramp almost unusable.</span></p>

"Japanbuilder","2018-01-22T06:39:26.573Z","Hey, you ever fly this thing!? ","<p>Over 2 years late to the party that was the LEGO TFA Wave 1 I finally got a copy of this most iconic ship in hand. Now that LEGO seems poised to pull this from its store (if it hasn&#39;t already) how has it held up? Come along with me on the journey?</p>

<p><strong>Packaging:</strong></p>

<p>We get the usual fare here for this wave. Kylo Ren in the top-right corner looking all mysterious and a nice graphic of the Falcon above Jakku being shot at by two thugs below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the back we get a nice tech sheet which I do miss now. I love how this wave displayed the accessories and a technical panel of the vessel within. I wish LEGO would have stayed with that graphical style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we get about 13&nbsp;bags some are double numbered and one is full of large plates with no numbers at all. Still the max numbered bag goes up to 9. We also get a sheet of stickers&nbsp;and one very big manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>In the very first bag we get two Kanjiklub members. One is Tasu Leech and the other is one of his gang members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both feature great printing front and back and Tasu gets a double sided head piece. Both expressions look equally angry to me though one does it with more gusto. The gang member has the better printing of the two it seems to me. Both carry old&nbsp;barrel loaded weapon molds but this&nbsp;fits the designs in the film where these guys had that throwback type of pirate look about them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A couple of bags later we get Han Solo and his First Mate Chewie. These are actually my first Han and Chewie figures in LEGO form so I quite like them. Han especially seems really cool to me. I love the printing of his holster on his hip and leg piece plus his &quot;new&quot; jacket. It is all well done and the hair piece and printing are great! Chewie comes with a first of its type stud shooting bowcaster. Though we would later get tons fo these in the Nexo Knights line I believe this was the first.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only Han gets a double sided head. One with a rogue&#39;s grin and the other with an annoyed smirk on his face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order of appearance we get the treasonous&nbsp;Stormtrooper FN-2187 now known as Finn by this point in the film. I quite liked his character and wished the writers would do something more with him, he is a child soldier, afterall. Interestingly, the LEGO figure seems to capture his inner character to me. One of his faces is&nbsp;worried and the other&nbsp;side looking grim as though he would like to forget where he has been. He comes with a blaster, though sadly it is not in the gun metal color of the one Han let him keep.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up in the figure roster is BB-8. This was one of the few sets with this character at the time which was sad as this set was and is very expensive. But this first design has held up well. We get 4 unique prints on his body piece and a very well printed head piece. Love this little guy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last figure we get when assembling this large set is Rey. This is actually my second Rey but I gotta say LEGO nailed the look here. If&nbsp;Ms. Ridley were transformed to LEGO she would look exactly as shown here. We get a double sided head piece with one giving off a friendly smile and the other a rather angry face. She comes armed with a pearl silver color pistol.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The Build was quite nice. This being my first Falcon I was worried about stability, swooshability and a host of other things but by far and away the techniques used here mean just about every part of this thing is well crafted and reasonably durable. Though it is quite heavy for constant swooshing it will swoosh, just not that gracefully.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is funny, actually, seeing how pieces interact in the early stages. The technic beams were all warping up at the ends but as the plates and other parts started to come on it quickly settled into an even shape. Fun stuff to see in person.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly, I am sure I may have made an error here and there but some piece colors did not match the instructions, again probably my fault someplace and it still came together but with this many pieces I guess color errors happen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are what my spare piece count looked like at the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Well it is HUGE. So big, in fact, that again my softbox struggled to get this into its belly. So excuse the shots from&nbsp;here on out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The finished model is just a smidge less wide than the gray Resistance X-Wing but about as long depth wise. Of course the overall bulk is leagues above any X-Wing and considering it has to house minifigures this thing is a flying doll house. There is room here for tons of&nbsp;figures for play or storage. The secret cargo hatch, the lowering ramp, rotating dish&nbsp;and cannons plus spring loaded shots round out the features but it is the level of detail everywhere that is most striking. For a LEGO model of a ship that is supposed to be really beat up the look fits the lore to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cargo mandibles are a great section of the model.&nbsp;The sticker detailing is a must to fully flesh out the look of the model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cockpit area is a bit cramped and the cockpit assembly is a bit hard&nbsp;to work but as it gets used I am sure it will start to conform to its studs more and more. Still figures look great in the cockpit and the space within the rest of the ship allow for tons of scenarios to play out.</p>

<p>The underside is not very good looking and it is very shallow thus moving figures to and from the entrance hatch is impossible But the amount of technic visible here is more than acceptable given the constraints of a commercial toy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>This is a great model, if you still need a Falcon for your sequel trilogy display or one you can mod for an OT display then this one will be hard to beat. Unless, of course, the one for the Solo movie manages to improve on this design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My little ones loved this ship and immediately took to it like ducks to water, finding all the nooks and hiding places for figures and making play scenarios of their very own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a total recommend if you don&#39;t already have one.&nbsp;</p>

"SWBrickmaster05","2018-01-02T17:27:46.15Z","The fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy!","<p>First of all, I am a huge fan of the millenium falcon, so when it was revealed that this one was to be released I was ecstatic. This set was a brilliant take on the classic ship, including everything from the new radar dish to a printed Dejarik&nbsp;board (holochess). The minifigures are great aswell! There is old Han, who looks very good. He has a nice print for his jacket, and a bit of printing on the legs for a holster.</p>

<p>The build was also a good experience. It was paced well, with a good array of pieces. It took me just under three hours to finish the build. It is a fairly simple construction, apart from the technic base, which could be confusing at times. One problem I had with the set was the large amount of stickers, and for a set that is priced at &pound;139.99 in the UK, I would have expected slightly less stickers and slightly more prints. However, the playability of the ship certainly makes up for this. There are very well hidden spring loaded shooters which don&#39;t detract from the overall look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are seven minifigures included in the set (counting BB-8). Chewbacca&nbsp;also has his new bowcaster piece which can fire a stud. The printing on the figures is good and I was more than satisfied with them.</p>

<p>To sum up, the 75105 Millenium Falcon is a brilliant set, with good minifigures&nbsp;and plenty of playability. At the moment it is also discounted heavily on the Lego Shop official website, so I would recommend grabbing one while you can, before it&#39;s retired.&nbsp;<br />
