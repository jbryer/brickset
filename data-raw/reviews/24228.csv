<p><b>THE OVERALL BUILD</b></p>

<p><em>The overall build is very cool but i feel that it is more of a display model than a model for playing with because of it&#39;s lack of overall play features. but one of it&#39;s few features which is my favorite features is being able to&nbsp;push the pins at the back of the ship to release the tie fighters. so i say well done to Lego for that</em>. &nbsp;Also inside the model it is very spacious and you can lift off the roof of the ship easily to get inside the ship to place minifigures inside or to take them out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also another great thing about this set which i&nbsp;briefly mentioned earlier&nbsp;the mini tie fighters which can be released by pins at the back of the ship. of course i understand you couldn&#39;t add full size Lego&nbsp;tie fighters because the model would have to be massive&nbsp;and would probably cost like $1000 so the mini ties were a really nice touch and really made the model feel complete. And whenever i pick up the model i have to release the tie because&nbsp;it&#39;s just so fun to do and because&nbsp;we see ties coming of the ship in the rebels show it just felt necessary to keep doing it. now onto the minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2. THE MINIFIGS&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><em>I</em> was very impressed with the minifigures&nbsp;because of the range of different minifigs and the selection Lego choose to include in this set. which are Agent Kallus who i must say looks very cool and lives up to his reputation in the show, Sabine&nbsp;with her helmet and hair piece 1 imperial officer, 2 imperial pilots and 1 imperial astromech.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs look i incredible as always, and i was so glad that Lego finally produced a Sabine&nbsp;figure with a helmet. but i do think it&#39;s a irritating because this is the only set were you can get Sabine with a helmet so if you want Sabine with her&nbsp;helmet you have to fork out &pound;100 or $130 just get a helmet. but apart from that great minifigs, great selection and incredible detail as always.</p>

<p><b><i>IN CONCLUSION&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p>I must say i was very impressed with this set and i was surprised at it&#39;s size because of the images online and on the box which made it look smaller. and if i was to have any major flaw with this set it would be the price because i feel &pound;100&nbsp;or $130 is pricey for this set and i feel that a price of &pound;80-75 or $100- 80 would have been better. (but this is only my opinion.)</p>

<p>So in conclusion a very good set, lots of cool minifigs including my personal favorite Agent Kallus, price could have been better and still could use maybe even 1 or 2 more play features but apart from those a very impressive and cool looking set.</p>

"Koot","2018-01-02T10:58:44.83Z","LEGO Star Wars 75106 Imperial Assault Carrier","<p>This set represents the large Imperial transport ship seen in the TV series, Star Wars Rebels. It includes 4 mini Tie Fighters and 6 minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>The Model/s:</strong></p>

<p>The Imperial Assault Carrier is actually quite large, and in my opinion, looks better than the one on TV. This is because of the nice texture and detail LEGO has added, and the overall shape is aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>The front&nbsp;cockpit opens up and has a comfortable space for one minifigure, with a printed control panel. The entire&nbsp;top middle section of the ship can be removed&nbsp;to access an interior with control desks for two minifigures.</p>

<p>Four mini Tie Fighters can be attached to the bottom of the model. Then, you are able to release them individually by pressing a small technic pin at the back of the ship. Additionally, you can rotate the back engine thruster and that will move the stud shooters on the top and bottom of the model.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with Agent Kallus, Sabine, Imperial Officer, two Tie Fighter Pilots and an Imperial Astromech Droid. As I am not a big Star Wars Rebels fan, I am not able to fully appreciate these characters or their significance in the shows.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>I would recommend this set to a Star Wars Rebels fan only. For a high price, I don&#39;t really think I got my money&#39;s worth since I am not that familiar with the TV show on which this is based.</p>

<p>But anyway, the ship is&nbsp;really playable and I am sure many Rebels fans will appreciate this set.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and I hope this was very helpful.</p>

"JW_2187","2018-05-27T15:38:33Z","The Gozanti-class assault carrier- an ugly giant.","<p>The Imperial Assault Carrier is based off the Gozanti class from star wars rebels. The set also contains 4 Microscale TIE Fighters, which are attached onto the bottom via technic bricks. These TIE fighters are a vast improvement on the 2008 version, the last of any tie fighters to still use the black and blue colour-scheme, this does provide a more nostalgic look however it lacks the accuracy that this has. Also, the dimensions are a bit wider, however this is ok for a rebels set which tends to lean more towards this art style and the Gozanti only appears in rebels as of the time of this review.</p>

<p>The ship&#39;s interior has a dark tan flooring. Normally, I am a huge fan of lego using dark tan, however in this case, it is inaccurate because as an imperial ship it should have a grey or black interior. Other than this however, the interior is basic but works with 2 computer consoles, either side of the carrying handle. Underneath this, there is also a large space for a crate which fits a kyber crystal underneath, using 6x8 trapdoor pieces. The roof and side panelling is easy to remove however I would have personally preferred to have this connected by studs, however, I must elaborate that it won&#39;t fall off un normal circumstances.</p>

<p>The cockpit is very similar to the republic cruiser and republic frigates from 2007 and 2011 respectively, with a simple bar and clip hinge and windscreen. Sadly like these models as well, only 1 seated figure can fit inside, whereas there are many scenes with Kallus standing with other officers and governors, eg. Pryce. Also, the awkward section behind is utilised inside as there is missile storage which is simply installed with the hinges on the plates.</p>

<p>One thing which is immediately obvious looking at this is that it is a masterclass in griebling and intricate detail, all over, looking at the sides, especially inside the wider sections. The top and bottom turrets are also synchronized and rotated by bevel gears in the bodywork which is controlled by rotating the single rear engine.</p>

<p>All of this positive description may seem odd, given the title which calls this ship and ugly giant and it is just that. The design is definitely function over form in canon and the set designers definitely achieve this look , in every detail, even the radar dishes on the side.</p>

<p>There are 5 figures and an astromech droid in the set. The 2 TIE Fighter Pilots are as expected, showing high levels of detail in the torso, legs and helmets. The Astromech; who is simply described as &quot;Imperial Astromech Droid&quot;. The print on the front is average, however this was the first astromech to feature a clear or translucent top and was an overlooked detail when it was released. Sabine is the same as in other sets however the orange has been replaced with light aqua in her hair as it changes between wave 1 and 2 as well as her dark red Mandalorian helmet which is perfect in terms of design accuracy. Kallus is the same as other sets, however includes his hair instead of his helmet. I think that lego could have created a new hair piece for him as it would also be useful in other sets, adding more variety in figures. There is also an imperial officer in dark tan uniforms who represents 1 of the 2 training officers in series 1 at the imperial academy.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say that this is an above average set, which uses the rather more unique concept, using smaller ships at a non-minifig scale with a minifig compatible ship. As a new-ish set, it&#39;s second hand price is still decreasing before it reaches it&#39;s low point. They can currently be bought for around &pound;50-&pound;60 however I think that it could decrease by around another &pound;5 before it increases again which I would predict to be around mid-2019.</p>
