"Nuruodo","2015-10-09T21:51:53.86Z","Best TIE Fighter","<p>I bought this set just because I wanted to have a starfighter&nbsp;from &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. I&nbsp;dind&#39;t expect to find a so well built TIE Fighter!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is quite big. I found the instructions pretty easy, except the fact that when there were big x2 passages to do I had problems in understanding which parts had to be done twice.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are as you can expect from the images you can see anywhere. However, some of the pieces used to build the cockpit were very particular.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are all new, from &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;. The new TIE Pilots are amazing, and their helmet is very strange and I like it very much. Also the Ground Crew is nice, with that hat. The Officer is not different from Hux and old Imperial Officers.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I built it in not so few time. Building the wings was a little boring, because they were the same, but however I didn&#39;t ever get tired.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I find the completed model amazing. I don&#39;t really know why, but it&#39;s very cool. I like the fact that the shooters aren&#39;t too &quot;important&quot; in the set. It&#39;s big just as it should be.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think that this set isn&#39;t the best from &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, but probably it&#39;s one of the most amazing. It&#39;s simple, it hasn&#39;t complicated parts, but however it&#39;s a true &quot;Star Wars&quot; starfighter.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Not as small as it could seem</p>

<p>&ndash; Cockipt high detailed with well hidden shooters and rotating antenna</p>

<p>&ndash; Researched bricks for the cockpit</p>

<p>&ndash; Nice <em>The Force Awakens </em>minifigures</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; It lacks playable parts (except the shooter)</p>

<p>&ndash; Maybe it costs too much to be a TIE Fighter</p>

I will announce it before I actually mention it and the rest of the review is safe.</strong></p>

<p>When I got back into LEGO a few years ago after not having touched it since I was a child, among the first full sized sets I bought was the 9492 TIE Fighter (others were the 9493 X-Wing and the 9495 Y-Wing). The TIE Fighters always were appealing to me. At some point I decided to rebuild the 9492 I had into a TIE Interceptor using a Rebrickable alt build I saw linked to this set (<a href=""https://rebrickable.com/mocs/anincompoop25/tie-interceptor"">https://rebrickable.com/mocs/anincompoop25/tie-interceptor</a>). Right then I knew I had to get another TIE to put next to it, but the 9492 had been discontinued by then. Luckily, I found this set at a great discount. I paid &euro;50 instead of the &euro;70/&euro;75 for which this set seems to be sold. I really think this is a &euro;50 set, but then again the prices have really exploded on the newer LEGO Star Wars sets.</p>

<p><img alt=""The old 9492 (MOC as TIE Interceptor), and the new 75101."" height=""332"" src=""http://s18.postimg.org/xxn0zph6x/IMG_5688.jpg"" width=""500"" /></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I never really know what to say about LEGO boxes. It&#39;s the same basic principle every time: set on the front, along with what mini figures to expect. On the back is shown what bits can open/turn/whatever.</p>

<p>The instructions are all in a single booklet, standard pages stapled together. I think they show the steps pretty well, seems to be a nice pace per step.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As most First Order (and before that, Empire) sets, expect much black, light grey and dark grey. As can be clearly seen there&#39;s a bunch of red this time as well, which really elevates the model to a new level in my opinion. Apart from the mini figure parts, there&#39;s three parts in this set that can&#39;t be found in any other set: Just like with the 9492 model, this TIE fighter features a hatch and windows with prints on them. Unlike the 9492 model, this set also has a window on the back, and the windows/hatch from this set are not (yet) found in other sets.</p>

<p>Frankly, I&#39;m mainly glad they dropped the number 99784 parts they used on the wings in the 9492 model and just started using 12x1 plates instead, looks much better I think.</p>

<p>There&#39;s much more bricks into this set than into the 9492 model. Much of this seems to go into an improved wing-hull connection.</p>

<p>Before seeing the film I thought the red looked a bit too bright in this set, going from the trailers I thought the Fighter itself featured more of a dark red, but the Fighter itself indeed has a splash of bright red.</p>

<h3>Mini figures</h3>

<p>Nothing really out of the ordinary, even though these are new mini figures. Compared to the 9492 model, an extra pilot is gained and an astromech droid is lost. The new pilot helmets are the main selling point here, but anyone building an army will be pleased with all four figures. <strong>Spoiler for first act of The Force Awakens movie follows in next line. Skip to the bullet points if you don&#39;t want to read the spoiler. </strong>I will still try to keep my remark here as spoiler free as possible but to anyone who has seen the film it should be obvious that the mini figures missing from this set are Poe Dameron in leather jacket and Finn in Stormtrooper armor. I would not have minded going without the generic crew member to gain those two, an extra mini figure would not have harmed the set either seeing as the price is so high.</p>

<ul>
	<li>TIE Fighter pilot: I like the new design, very detailed. Nice helmet as well with an oxygen tube going down into the torso. The head is a generic angry clone face, and this is a mistake in my opinion. Older TIE pilots had faces with black clothing around it, which helped since the helmets don&#39;t go all the way down to the body. Now with the new pink heads, the neck of the pilots are completely exposed. The 2014 Advent Calendar pilot had this problem as well. The new helmets have less skin exposed but it still looks jarring to me.</li>
	<li>First Order Officer: great detail into this figure, loving the cap and the skin color. Good luck trying to see which character in the movie this figure is based on though, he may be off in the back somewhere but I didn&#39;t spot him. Thanks to being an officer instead of a &quot;hey look at this new weird helmet&quot; guy, this figure is much easier to use in whatever sci-fi scenario you&#39;re running though, be it army building or using LEGO for your Star Wars RPG group.</li>
	<li>First Order Crew Member: another generic guy, mainly interesting for army builders and big setpiece makers. I get that the helmet is an evolution from the ones seen in the old trilogy but it just looks weird to me, it doesn&#39;t help that they&#39;re not prominently featured in the movie.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The wings can get repetitive. Because I don&#39;t like having to do the same thing twice over, I decide in situations like this to build the two wings at the same time. Because a wing on its own has a couple of repetitions, this meant that a couple of times I was busy making the same thing four times next to each other.</p>

<p>The build of the cockpit is fun and diverse. There are few repetitions, and the feeling of what repetition there is is even being lessened because often you&#39;re doing black on one side and red on the other.</p>

<p>There&#39;s only four stickers in this set, two pairs of two. One pair seems impossible to do the set without since two small red stickers are used on a larger part to keep the red going. The other pair are the symbols on the center of the wings. I think this is weird since for the 9492 model they used printed parts, I don&#39;t see why they feel that they should use stickers this time around.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks awesome and true to the movie. I love how the new TIE Fighters have lighter solar panels on the wings and a black hull, makes for a nice contrast with the older TIE Fighters. The red really makes this model seem special. The model seems stronger where the wings connect to the hull than the old 9492 model. The way these arms are connected to the wings is fun to build and looks true to the Fighter in the movie.</p>

<p>One small downside: The two parts on the bottom of the cockpit seem like an afterthought. Seeing as these represent the ship&#39;s main turret, more effort could have gone into this. They&#39;re really larger on the models in the film, and they can rotate from the front to the back. I did a quick fix by putting two black studs on top of each other and then on the center of the turret, but I&#39;m open to anyone presenting a better option.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this new TIE Fighter really became my favourite LEGO TIE out there, with its slick black design and improvements over the old 9492 model (superficial as well as to the core) this model seems superior in all ways. Though the 9492 had a black astromech.</p>

<p>The main downside here is the price. That, combined with a lack of memorable figures, makes this a set that many will skip out on.</p>

<p>The only real downside I see to the Fighter itself is the misstep in creating the turret on the bottom of the cockpit.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s a TIE Fighter, few ships are more iconic.</li>
	<li>Many improvements over the older models, even the most recent one.</li>
	<li>Great colors, set looks great overall.</li>
	<li>Thanks to the TIE being the TIE, you get a fairly large looking ship compared to the number of parts it has.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A &euro;50 set sold at &euro;70.</li>
	<li>Turret on the bottom of the cockpit fails to impress, could&#39;ve used a bit more thought.</li>
	<li>No real iconic mini figures.</li>
	<li>TIE Fighter pilot heads not being faces surrounded by black clothing makes helmet not covering neck seem jarring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this is a really awesome set with the only drawback being the price, the other cons I mention are really insignificant if the set would be cheaper. If you are a Star Wars fan and you ever find this set at 25% or more discounted there&#39;s really no reason not to get it.</p>

"PooPotato","2015-12-26T07:59:13.633Z","The Best TIE Yet!","<p><strong>NOTE: Throughout this review/future reviews, I may/may not reference&nbsp;The Force Awaken&#39;s plot. &nbsp;To&nbsp;avoid major/minor spoilers, I will write these sections in bold (excluding the minifigure section of course), and furthermore, they can be avoided in their entirety without impact to the review.</strong></p>

<p>When I first saw this set in The Force Awakens line, I was genuinely unimpressed. &nbsp;It looked like a newish version of 9492 TIE Fighter. &nbsp;9492 is a favorite of mine, and I felt like this set was a carbon copy of it in negative colors. &nbsp;Months passed after the initial release, and sooner than later December had come along, and I saw TFA on opening weekend. &nbsp;Without going into much detail, TFA has instantly ranked in my top two Star Wars films, either tied with Empire or A New Hope. &nbsp;<strong>The new Special Forces TIE Fighter instantly became my favorite craft&nbsp;after the first quarter of the film, when Poe and Finn escape from Kylo Ren&#39;s Star Destroyer</strong>. &nbsp;This is why I was pleasantly surprised to receive this as a Christmas gift. &nbsp;While the new T-70 X-Wings looked cool, there weren&#39;t enough differences from the original T-65 for me to be thoroughly impressed. &nbsp;I also&nbsp;had no idea that it was a two-seater as well, and was pleasantly surprised to see this update to a classic design. There has been a genuine lack of two-seater fighter craft in the Star Wars universe (only the Y-Wing and Snowspeeder come to mind), so this addition by the design crew of TFA is easily one of my favorites. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was taller than it was wide, and showed the Special Forces TIE performing a strafing run over the dunes of Jakku. &nbsp;The First Order Officer and Crew Member are also shown running across the dunes with their sidearms. &nbsp;The instruction booklet and sticker sheet (there were only 4 very small&nbsp;stickers by the way :D) came in a separate plastic bag, but that still didn&#39;t stop it from being bent inside the box. &nbsp;I wish that Lego would package a cardboard slab with all of their larger sets, but it wasn&#39;t too bent up this time, so this is just a small complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with any of the Imperial/First Order vehicles, a large amount of pieces were of light grey and black. &nbsp;The addition of red is unique for an Imperial/First Order vehicles as well, and I like it. &nbsp;Aside from the three wonderfully printed cockpit pieces, the only pieces that I had never seen before were the two black &quot;Minifig roller-skate&quot; pieces that are to the left and right of the center wing emblem. &nbsp;Scavenger wise there are some pretty big plates here, and with the printed cockpit pieces, you could easily build a noir themed Coruscant&nbsp;MOC.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As with the rest of the TFA designs, I have been immensely impressed with how well the design crew was able to blend the old and the new, and this&nbsp;is definitely reflected on the minifigures&nbsp;included with this set.</p>

<p><strong>Two First Order TIE Fighter Pilots&nbsp;</strong>are the first ones that are built during the construction process. &nbsp;They look very different from their predecessor in 9492, as they come with highly detailed torsos and leg printing. &nbsp;One of my favorite parts of these minifigures is that their oxygen supply tubes were molded with a flexible rubber that allows for their helmets to turn left and right with the tube staying relatively centered. &nbsp;Under the helmets are the extremely common Clone Trooper faces, even though they aren&#39;t clones. &nbsp;They each come with sidearms. I must admit, I absolutely love this new TIE Pilot design!</p>

<p><strong>First Order Crewmember&nbsp;</strong>is the next minifigure that is built. &nbsp;This design is nowhere near as innovative as the TIE Pilot&#39;s, but it definitely gets the job done. Basically, this minifigure is the First Order equivalent to the Death Star Gunner minifigure in 75034 Death Star Troopers. &nbsp;The torso printing is relatively similar to the Imperial counterpart, but the helmet design is entirely different. &nbsp;I view it as a hybrid between the Death Star Gunner&#39;s helmet and &nbsp;9492&#39;s Death Star Trooper&#39;s helmet. &nbsp;Under this helmet is a non-clone face with a determined expression. &nbsp;He also comes with a sidearm.</p>

<p><strong>First Order Officer&nbsp;</strong>is the final minifigure that is built. &nbsp;He definitely looks the part of an officer, with a wonderfully printed hat, face, and torso. &nbsp;The hat is easily my favorite aspect of this minifigure. &nbsp;It really shows how far Lego has come since the beginning of the Star Wars line, as the Imperial Officer hat remained largely unchanged until a couple of years ago. &nbsp;My only complaint is that his jackboots aren&#39;t printed. &nbsp;If I&#39;m correct, there has been some dual leg molding going on with The Simpsons minifigures, so I&#39;m sure that process could be carried over to Star Wars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I do enjoy the inclusion of the Crewmember and Officer, I am slightly disappointed that I have nowhere to display them. &nbsp;The 3 non-pilot minifigures that came with 9492 went straight to my 10185 Death Star, which is always awaiting new Imperial staff. &nbsp;Unlike the First Order Snowtroopers, these minifigures do not blend in very well with their Imperial ancestors, and so they wait for a Force Awakens diorama...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Construction began with building of the cockpit. &nbsp;While I initially thought that this set was too similar to 9492, the cockpit design in this set is vastly superior. &nbsp;While it did need to be bigger in order to incorporate both pilots, it managed to capture the spherical shape of the cockpit much better than 9492 did. &nbsp;It also improved upon the wing/cockpit connection that has seemed to plague all TIE Fighters.&nbsp; The red stripe on the right side made it very easy to tell which way I was supposed to have the cockpit facing while building it, showing that it had another use aside from it&#39;s cool&nbsp;look. &nbsp;After this was the construction of the wings, which of course was nowhere near as fun because I had&nbsp;to build two of them. &nbsp;Their design is largely similar to 9492&#39;s design, which is a good thing because I can&#39;t see any way of improving on 9492&#39;s wing&nbsp;design. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The build definitely reached it&#39;s peak excitement-wise&nbsp;with the construction of the&nbsp;cockpit,&nbsp;and quickly tapered off as the wings were built. &nbsp;I pay close attention to how much I enjoy a build, and if the cockpit were built last instead of the wings, this set would definitely be one of my favorite building experiences. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When compared to 9492, it may not look like there is much of a difference between the two sets. &nbsp;However, if you asked me to choose my favorite between the two, I would choose this one indefinitely. &nbsp;The new cockpit design is awesome, and the building experience was just as exceptional. &nbsp;Another notable difference is that there isn&#39;t just a single large exhaust port on the center of this TIE.&nbsp;Instead there are two smaller ones on the left and right in order to compensate for the rear-gunner&#39;s view. &nbsp;There are a couple of drawbacks to this set however. &nbsp;First off is the price. &nbsp;The main reason I never even considered picking this set up when it first came out was it&#39;s insane price tag. &nbsp;It only has 87 more pieces than 9492, yet costs $15 more (keep in mind that 9492 was considered overpriced as well!). &nbsp;$70 is just way too much for this set, and if I hadn&#39;t received it as a Christmas gift, I don&#39;t think I ever would have purchased it. &nbsp;The only design complaint I have is that the seats for the Pilots are covered with 2x2 tiles. &nbsp;This has been a common staple of Lego Star Wars starfighters for the past couple of years, and I absolutely hate it. &nbsp;It makes no sense to me why they can&#39;t just leave the studs showing so the minifigure doesn&#39;t bounce around while you&#39;re trying to swoosh the craft. &nbsp;Luckily, the Pilot&#39;s hands are able to clip onto the controls, so this design factor isn&#39;t really all that bad.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love the look and feel of this set. &nbsp;If you can get it at a much lower price, I highly recommend it. &nbsp;Now that I&#39;ve gotten this set, I guess it&#39;s inevitable that I purchase Poe&#39;s X-Wing now...</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Awesome Cockpit Design</p>

<p>Amazing Pilot Minifigures</p>

<p>Great color scheme</p>

<p>Good part selection</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Boring wing construction</p>

<p>Insane price</p>

<p>Sorry for the long review! &nbsp;When I really like a set, I can&#39;t help but go into full detail!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>Striking box, which stands out on the Shelf, Kylo Ren looking on in the top right corner, The now standard action shots on the back of the box. Nice compact instruction booklet, gone where the days of the big books or even sheets. Instructions are easy to follow. I&#39;ve not noticed this before but my instructions came sealed in a bag with the stickers, I can&#39;t remember this with other new sets but I may of missed this.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>This set is 517 pieces. Plenty of Black and Grey, there is lovely addition of red into to the set which breaks the colour, The 2 pilot screens and cockpit cover are a nice size and add to the set really well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>There are 4 figures in the set, 2 Pilots, Ground Crew and First Officer, all members of the First Order. The First Officer is in what I would class as imperial grey, but nice to see a different colour tone used on the head piece. The 2 pilots have great helmet pieces, with oxygen tubes added which go down to rest on there torso. The Ground Crew figure has an excellent helmet, which is styled and matches from the movie excellently. I like the fact that we do not have the &quot;Stud&quot; guns for the figures and the actual blasters, which I personally prefer, although my son prefers the stud guns.</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>You build the cockpit and main body first then the wings are last, The build is relatively straight forward, The wings are constructed well and are very sturdy. The instructions for the wings are repeated. There is one wing each in the last 2 bags in the pack, if you wanted to you could build both wings at the same time. There is use of some stickers but these add to the effects on the star fighter. The fighter also comes with 2 Spring Shooters.</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>Once complete you can fit both Pilots in the cockpit facing outwards one front and one back, My only downside is the fact that the pilots sit on 2x2 tiles and not on studs, so the pilots are not secure, this seems to becoming more popular with sets which I am not a fan off, You could if you wanted swap the tiles for studs if you have the pieces available.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>The First Order have improved a 30+ year old model from the Empire and this is reflected in the Lego Set, I like it, it looks good, and it goes really well with Poe&#39;s X-Wing (75102) It reflects the movie very well indeed.</p>

(revised set version)","<p>Slowly catching up on my Force Awakens sets and I am happy to have gotten the revised version of the First Order TIE Fighter. How has this set held up and what if anything does the revision add to the mix?</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>We get a very tall box, so tall in fact I could hardly fit it into my softbox. It depicts a scene over a desolate world with the set&#39;s main vehicle flying above and discharging some laser bolts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back of the box shows off the cool holographic spec sheet of the vehicle, as well as, what comes in the box for the figures and our vessel. This is mixed in with other shots of the TIE in other situations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we will find a manual with a small sticker sheet and 4 bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For parts we do not get anything spectacular but I do like the three printed canopy pieces. Each one is different and they are simply amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your left over bits will include the usual pins and one by one studs but we also get a pair of roller skates in black which could be useful for other themes or other detailing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4162/34751631756_1eac2f4040.jpg[/img]</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with 4 figures and they are all excellent to have if you are amassing a First Order fleet of ships or just need First Order personnel in general. We get one First Order Crew member which has been seen in a few sets already and one officer. The officer seems to be an older fellow with graying hair and a dark tan skin tone. I love his prints but really like his First Order cap with the faction&#39;s logo right in the center.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The highlight figures though are the TIE Fighter pilots. They have that nice sleek design to their outfits and the helmet moulding is amazing. Of note is the hose piece that extends from the right nozzle of the helmet to their&nbsp;chest respirator. Another indicator that the TIE runs on a minimal life support system in the cabin. Though that does raise questions about certain scenes in the film when folks pilot this thing without said gear. Either way though, these guys look great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is not complicated, and in fact, the pieces are very common pieces except&nbsp;for the printed canopies. Nothing was surprising and there is very little technic involved. It is a straight on brick built set&nbsp;and it works very well here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, as noted in my title and my intro this is the revised version of this set. Somewhere along production LEGO changed a small part of the build and added more pieces to the set. It now clocks in a bit over 530 pieces I believe and the alterations were made to the radiator assembly. In particular where the radiators connect to the hull of the TIE.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4189/34629311372_713115ee2b.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>I am not certain why this changed at all since the connection method remains the same as the unrevised version but the framing that encases this point of the build sure is beefier as a result. I wonder if some of these were coming loose around the frame or preventing the clips from attaching fully since the build would rub up right up to the slats on the hull.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still it was an enjoyable experience perhaps more so by the fact that this is only the 2nd TIE I have ever built, my first being last year&#39;s TIE Advanced.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The finished model looks amazing. The red and black color scheme really make this thing pop along with the lighter grey radiator paneling. While I wish that color was lighter the ship, nevertheless, looks amazing.</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4156/34751627616_eb1472240b.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4219/33949095874_a498bac86b.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>Though the revised version does make the radiator connection point look far too bulky. The first version&#39;s certainly looks more accurate to&nbsp;the in-movie vehicle than this. Despite that it adds great presence to any First Order fleet and is a must have if you love TIE fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also modified the sitting arrangements for my pilots since the official build&nbsp;only had them on 2x2 tiles. I made mine to sit on a 1x2 grill piece and a 1x2 plate piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>All tolled this thing is fantastic. The ship and its pilots are great to have and its size is perfect for swooshing. Though I cannot compare it to the original version I would say this revision is 99% the same and I don&#39;t quite see why a revision was required. But either way getting a TIE is fun. It looks great on the shelf and the twin spring loaded shot make for fun strafing of Resistance positions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only beef is the price. Though I did notice a lot of very large pieces for the radiators I am not sure they add up to the price I got this for. If you can find this for a good price still go for it. Your First Order army and navy will thank you!</p>

<br />
This TIE fighter looks amazing. The red inserts are really nice and the way it is built is really clever I think.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only issue is the price.. I think it&#39;s too much just comparing it to the other Republic vehicles of the same price band (in terms of size, action figures, etc...)</p>

<p>But it&#39;s so cool!&nbsp;</p>

"lukaszsw","2020-10-07T17:44:18.04Z","One of the best Tie fighters","<p>Very nice set. I think it looks amazing with black and red pod and black outline wings.</p>

<p>The tie has two seats and two pilots &mdash; First Order Tie Pilots. Their helmets are almost completely black, and they are nearly invisible through the windows. I placed Lego Inferno Squad inside (they have custom Tie helmets) and they look much better because helmet eyes contrast with the helmet and are visible with the hatch closed.</p>

<p>Locking wings to the arms is a little tricky. Sometimes 4 connectors don&#39;t close correctly. I&#39;ve had to remove wings centrepieces to see inside. But when the parts lock correctly, the wings are fixed nicely and don&#39;t fall off easily at all.</p>

<p>There are 3 hatches total &mdash; top, front and back. The front one is typical tie in translucent red. The back has a custom, which&nbsp;I think unique to this set &mdash; it looks very nice and might be useful in MOCs.</p>

<p>The cabin is only divided halfway through, upper part is open. This is for two reason: 1) to be able to put a mini through the upper hatch, 2) for the helmets to fit because minis sit only one stud apart from each other (the wall would interfere). For me, it looks rough, especially when both hatches are open, you can see through</p>

<p>Spring-loaded shooters are not concealed and are hard to reach &mdash; the missiles just stick out at the bottom, and it is not obvious how to shoot them with one hand. More modern sets have it solved better &mdash; like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75240-1/Major-Vonreg-s-TIE-Fighter"">Vonreg Tie </a>or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75272-1/Sith-TIE-Fighter"">Sith Tie</a></p>

<p>To sum up:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(+) two seats and three nice hatches</li>
	<li>(+) sturdy build</li>
	<li>(+) Looks great</li>
	<li>(-) Cockpit is not separated</li>
	<li>(-) hard to reach spring-loaded missiles</li>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-27T19:00:26.383Z","""I've always wanted to fly one of these things.""","<p>Arguably the most recognisable Imperial and/or First Order vehicle in Star Wars&nbsp;is&nbsp;the classic TIE Fighter. At the time of release there was no Imperial option on general release, but since the release of the Solo wave, both the Imperial grey and&nbsp;First Order red and black colour schemes are just as easy to track down.<br />
<br />
The TIE comes in a pretty sizable box, so when you/your child/your partner/your parent gets their hands on it, you&#39;ll know it&#39;s going to be a build to set aside some time for. In my case, as an almost fully capable adult, it took me roughly 1 1/2 hours.<br />
As with all of the larger sets, the pieces come in a set of numbered bags (four, in this case), so you can build the TIE in stages without getting all 500ish pieces muddled together in a nightmare pile. The central part of the TIE is a very enjoyable build, with very little repetition and some clever Lego trickery to make curves from angular pieces. The cockpit roof and windows are all moulded round pieces, but the rest of the set are squares, rectangles and pyramids, so the overall rounded shape is cleverly achieved.<br />
The wings are a nice build, although not as much fun as the cockpit, and this is where the set suffers from repetition which younger minds might find frustrating. Obviously due to the symmetrical nature of the TIE Fighter, the wings consist of two identical builds, and in fact bags 3 and 4 are both exactly the same - one bag per wing. Younger builders might find the wing construction a little tricky as well and might need an adult on hand to help them out. It&#39;s not that the wings are particularly complicated, but a couple of the instruction diagrams are a little unclear as to exactly where you&#39;re adding the pieces, turning almost into a game of spot-the-difference from the previous diagram.<br />
For a large set, the TIE contains very few stickers, which many will find a relief. There are only four small ones, although two fit onto disc-shaped bricks, and so care should be taken to make sure they&#39;re orientated correctly.<br />
In terms of sturdiness, the assembled fighter seems to be quite robust. There were a few stages during assembly where it felt a little wobbly in places, but once it all came together that soon passed.<br />
<br />
The TIE doesn&#39;t feature as many interactive parts as some other ship like the X-Wing, but the cockpit opens up to insert the pilot and gunner, and there are two missile launchers beneath the cockpit for flinging small plastic projectiles across the room like a maniac.<br />
<br />
The mini figures are probably the only letdown in this set, coming with a pair of TIE pilots, a First Order Officer and a technician. The pilots are nice, but the officer and technician seem a little run-of-the-mill. A much better idea would have been to include Poe and Stormtrooper-Finn to allow reconstruction of the Star Destroyer escape scene from early on in the film.<br />
<br />
To summarise: A nice large set resulting in a great looking model, and good value for money. Let down slightly by an unimpressive minifigure selection.</p>
