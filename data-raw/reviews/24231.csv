"Bl0ck_Head","2016-01-09T07:05:48.837Z","Brainstein is going down!","<p>Hey, this is the ultra agent set Ultrasonic Showdown, it comes with 7 stickers just for the jet which seems like a lot, also&nbsp;there isn&#39;t much of a showdown actually here, just seems like Agent Curtis Bolt is about to blast Brainstein outta the sky!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has 187 pieces, but i&#39;m pretty sure you know this, you must of saw that parts list before clicking this review right?...Moving on, this set actually has three exclusive parts just to this set alone, the Brain, The Helmet, And his Face/Head, it also has some older parts/newer parts re-colored but they have been seen before, but some of the parts&nbsp;are not even seen in 20 or more sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with two minifigures, Curtis Bolt has the same face/hair as other sets he has appeared in, and the torso/legs are the same as the other agents in the second wave of Ultra Agents. Brainstein has his same torso&nbsp;only exclusive to this set and set 70169, but the head and everything is exclusive to only this set, he does not come with legs, beside the arachnid style walking bottom torso.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build is fairly easy, it has lots of curved pieces so it may get confusing at times, the jet comes with a detachable drone that can survey the area and attach onto the back of him, the drone is also meant for the Ultra Agents App, (It isn&#39;t needed but it can unlock certain events in the app) the jet itself is really cool for such a cheap set, and the curves make it look really sleek.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like the completed version of this great for play and display, comes with enough trans-orange studs to replace any that get lost, and it can rotate 360 degrees to hit targets from all angles in the sky, it even has a compartment for Curtis to put his weapon/energy gun behind him on a clip piece and it still allows Curtis to sit normally and lean back, the drone is very nice just to look at and for the Ultra Agents App, but it looks better attached to the jet.</p>

<p>The design on Dr.Brainstein doesn&#39;t really have a flaw that I can see, I love the custom helmet and the brain in this set, it could work well for a Halloween themed minifigure, and he even has a sort of propulsion system on the bottom of him so he can fly away</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like the set and its perfect for $19.99, I would try getting this from a retail store or from the Lego Store, the Online market has plummeted ever since this set was released, so no matter how much you may want this, do NOT buy it for over $19.99, its the perfect price for the perfect toy.</p>

<p>Hope my review helped, thanks for viewing!</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-19T12:14:25.3Z","Six shooters on turrets, Beware the Ultrasonic Showdown!","<p>I like this set and am glad I own it. The Ultra Agents theme is great fun and synchs nicely with a well developed Lego city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building the set was interesting. It&#39;s not as complicated as it&#39;s bigger brothers, the Ultra Agents ocean HQ or their Ultra Agents Ultracopter, both of which I own. The wings are swept using a clever but simple method and the cock pit is please to me with the side on sloping parts.</p>

<p>You get some great parts especially as someone who likes building in black. The white six shooters are a great contrast though and the trans blue looks good.</p>

<p>This is another playable set. Not only does it work nicely within it&#39;s own theme, but any lego city gets more awesome with a super jet roaring above. The turret mounted six shooters are very fun to unload at &quot;baddies&quot;, the stealth drone can detach and recon for you.</p>

<p>The two minifigs look good. Especially the &quot;baddie&quot; with his many legs and stuck on backpack stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros -&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fun with playble six shooters and a drone.</p>

<p>Quite big once assembled for the number of parts, seems to have a big wing span,&nbsp; gives it presence.</p>

<p>Is light so very swooshable. More so than the ultra copter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons -</p>

<p>Not a fan of the hole in the middle between the wings, engine and cockpit. Looks a little odd.</p>

<p>Minifig Ultra Agent only has a tiny gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This seems to do very well on the second hand market, so when you get bored, you should be able to move it on. I won&#39;t though.&nbsp;</p>
