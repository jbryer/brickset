"MisterTem","2015-06-20T22:19:13.277Z","Good for Play","<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Just to start this off, the model was one stud shorter than shown in the instruction booklet. However, it is entirely possible that someone swapped the parts on me, as the box I received from a private seller on Amazon looked beat up and was taped with what looked to be Scotch Tape, instead of the standard&nbsp;LEGO style of tape. Now that that is out of the way, I&#39;ll start my review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p style=""text-indent: -10px;""><span style=""font-size: medium;"">&nbsp; On the front of the box, you can see the Ocean HQ itself with CGI (computer generated image) water. The Electro Flyer Piloted by Electrolyzer, one of the set&#39;s villains. On the back it shows some of the cannons and play features.</span></p>

<p style=""text-indent: -10px;"">&nbsp; The instructions have only the common flaw of failing to select the correct color for each LEGO&nbsp;piece (light grey looks dark grey, etc).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The parts include an abundance of trans light blue pieces, as well as black parts, with a&nbsp;lot of technic items. From what I could tell, there were no new parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The minifigures include:</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Agent Jack Fury (In battle armor and helmet)</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Agent Caila&nbsp;Phoenix (With a new style of jetpack)</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Agent Steve Zeal</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Agent Trey Swift</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Electrolyzer (One of the villains)</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Terabyte&nbsp;(With hair instead of the helmet, and as a prisoner. Also the other villain)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The build is fairly mundane and boring until about the fourth bag, as before that it is a lot of repetition in things to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The completed model is a bit fragile in the front, and in the middle there are two plates that just sit there, and if you put pressure on will pop off, into the bowels of the ship, where the cannon is stored. I recommend grabbing it from behind and in the front right before the slanted panels begin. Or, if you are strong enough (and unwise enough...) to grab it with one hand, grab it in the middle, by putting pressure on the sides, and little on the bottom itself.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The model features two actual firing guns, one spring loaded, and the other a 12 shot stud launcher. It also has 3 sets of &quot;play&quot; guns, which do not fire. Two of which are on the sides, and the other is on the same rig as the spring loaded launcher.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">It is important to note that the boat DOES NOT actually float.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">On the sides are four fold down panels, one that holds Agent Phoenix&#39;s jetpack, another that holds a speed boat with a single shot stud launcher, and two in the front that each have a &quot;play&quot; gun, that can be detached placed on the railing of the deck, or used where they are set up.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">In the back is a computer bay, in which the screen in actually an AppBrick, for the tablet version of the Ultra Agents LEGO Game.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Also in the back, but a bit higher up is a fully rotating 360 degree command deck, which seats three.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, the LEGO set is, while very fragile, great for play.</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-19T12:54:05.53Z","Big Ship Action!","<p>This set is huge! And awesome. No Lego Harbour should be without one.</p>

<p>This build was involved and reminded me of my Lego Star Destroyer with the hinges and the interesting angles but better done. The result is the hull is very stiff and very light for it&#39;s size.I also owned a very old school Lego Fire Station and the door concealing the big turret reminded me of that very much.</p>

<p>This a big set with a good price to parts ratio. I&nbsp;love how the side mounted cockpit screens made such a light open bridge. I am not normally a big fan of stickers, but they do make the bridge look very high tech.</p>

<p>Playability would score a ten out of five if I could. There are multiple concealed weapons and vehicles. The &quot;baddies&quot; look good. The hidden jail cell has taken the place of another potential large weapon, but adds wider variety&nbsp;of play options. Personally I am tempted to replace the forward harpoon gun with a quad mounted spring loader that pops up from the bows where the jail cell is, but we shall see.</p>

<p>There are pop up weapons behind two bow panels. They are fun but seem a little small and anemic. I would like to replace them with articulated stud shooters similar to the turrets on the Ultracopter or heavy technic guns like Spaceship&nbsp;Spaceship.</p>

<p>The mid ships panels conceal two smaller vehicles. A boat and a jet pack.Very nice. Very playable.</p>

<p>The &quot;Baddie&quot; minfigs, one attacker, one prisoner, open up worlds of possible scenarios.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros -</p>

<p>Very playable.</p>

<p>Huge armory of equipment for the minifig crew.</p>

<p>It looks awesome.</p>

<p>The spinning bridge and pop out six shooters&nbsp;are great fun.</p>

<p>.Cons (minor) -</p>

<p>Some pop out weapons look too small to me.</p>

<p>The spring loaded harpoon can&#39;t go far.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love this and would not sell mine, but the second hand value seems high if anyone gets bored. I want to build a huge lego bay just for it&#39;s adventures......</p>
