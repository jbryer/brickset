"CC_2224","2017-07-15T04:58:30.397Z","It is great for a free polybag","<p>This polybag had less than 50 pieces, so the build was short but still fun. The parts included have some variety, and I could see people using the model for parts / minifigure accessories. It has&nbsp;playability in the form of stud shooters which are detachable, and for 43 pieces; that is acceptable. The highlight of fhis polybag is the Tournament Kai minifigure, which is the same one that is in the sets. As a free polybag, I think it is great, but I just don&#39;t feel like it is worth buying online because you could just get Tournament Kai online or in the Jungle Trap set, which has more pieces and two total minifigures.</p>

<p>This set comes in a polybag with the normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a couple nice parts in this set. You get two gold sais, two trans orange 2x2 round slide shoes, and a 4x4 red angle brick. The total piece count for the set is 43.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><b>Kai:</b></p>

<p>You get Kai from the Tournament of Elements. He has his brown iconic rubber hair piece with a red ninja mask. He has a single sided head. It is the normal Kai head with the scar/scratches by his eye. He has printing on both sides of torso. He has a red (robe or uniform) on with Ninjago markings on the outer part of the robe/uniform. On the back you have the&nbsp;fire element logo. He also has printing on his legs. You have the robe/uniform continue on down from the torso with a red/maroon cloth piece hanging down on the left leg. He has no weapon or accessory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this isn&#39;t a really good polybag. The drifter cannot stand freely on its own due to the two trans orange 2x2 round slide shoes on the bottom of it. It only leans to the right or left and can&#39;t stand without leaning. The stud shooters on the top look awful. They don&#39;t work (as in the look for me) and would have preferred the mounted (1x2 stud shooter) over the hand held ones. If they used this I think it would have looked better. I don&#39;t like that the stud shooters are pointing off the sides. Again the 1x2 stud shooter would have fixed this by having them being centered and facing straight ahead. Kai is okay to get. This version comes in a few sets besides this one including set 70752 Jungle Trap which retailed for 6.99 USD. So the figure isn&#39;t as appealing as you can get him in a set for just a few dollars more. Overall I would only recommend this to Ninjago fans/collectors. If you aren&#39;t a fan or have any interest in Ninjago you can definitely pass on getting this set. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
