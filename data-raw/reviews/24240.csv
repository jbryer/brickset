Ignoring any of the other sets in the May 2015 Daily Mail promotion, I jumped at the chance to add this one to my collection as well. I soon found it to be just as fun, if not more fun as a very cheap promo set. Here I&rsquo;ll look, in probably too much detail for such a small set, at all the factors that make it a worthwhile little vehicle to pick up.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>As per usual for polybag sets, this set is in a... polybag. The tractor is attractively displayed on a colourful farm background, which I appreciate seeing effort has been put into just like any other Creator boxart. The instructions, oddly, are actually double the size of the previous Creator promo set&#39;s, and I see no clear reason for this as there isn&#39;t even extra advertising! The instructions are very clear and easy to understand, but lack an inventory.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set is pretty packed with useful parts! There are no large &#39;filler&#39; parts, which is nice to see, instead we get a fun selection of clips, hinges and SNOT bits and pieces. A ludicrous four <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4244627"">2x1 handles</a> are included, as well as four blue <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/407023"">headlight bricks</a> and one of the newer SNOTty plates. As a source of vehicle parts it&#39;s fairly decent too, with five <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4210631"">grille</a> <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4540382"">parts</a>, some useful <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4638658"">windscreens</a> and two sizes of wheel and tire. As for spares, the set&#39;s surprisingly good too.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>There are no minifigs in this set, but that&#39;s no great loss really. The set does come with four of the new-styled flat-ended <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4289542"">robot claws</a>, plus a spare, two black <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6116604"">lightsabre blades</a> and some black <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4223247"">droid arms</a>, all of which may be welcome as minifig accessories anyway.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Short and simple like any promotional set, the build on this is nothing amazing, and&#39;d take no more than 5 minutes no matter how deliberately slowly you slave over it. The build can almost be considered to be in two parts, with the whole tractor built to begin with then the trailer part added separately afterwards. The connection of the robot arms on the back makes arranging the four spikes on the ground a slightly fiddly job but results in a satisfying overall look. The instructions tell you to clip the two &lsquo;smokestacks&rsquo; on at a very particular height, and the uncertainty of getting them perfectly aligned bugs me, but isn&rsquo;t that much of a problem at all.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The tractor seems pretty well proportioned in my mind, and is very clearly representing that particular vehicle. It looks decent from most angles, including the back. It has all the small details you&rsquo;d expect from a tractor, such as rear red lights, a top light, the smokestacks and numerous grille parts. The trailer is obviously a ploughing tool and is quite successful, despite being harder to place perfectly parallel with the ground. A nice, perhaps unintentional touch, is the way the robot arms can be hinged upwards and the whole trailer folded up out of the way in a sufficiently realistic manner, while retaining the vehicle&rsquo;s balance. No part of the model feels lacking to me, as this set even features a driver&rsquo;s seat, unlike the previous <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30283-1/Off-Road"">Creator vehicle polybag</a>. It feels as if there&rsquo;re a few options when it comes to playability with this one, as the articulation in it means it can even be &lsquo;posed&rsquo; on a desk.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>As a free-with-a-newspaper set, this one is close to perfect. Sure, some&rsquo;ll be disappointed by the lack of minifgures, but I think that despite that this set feels complete. A good parts selection and colour scheme helps to make it stand out as good value for money. I&rsquo;d recommend grabbing this one if you get the chance for less than &pound;3. It makes a nice display piece and offers more playability than you&rsquo;d think.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Vehicle design new and not seen often. LEGO Tractor stands out as fun and awesome looking model with some great elements that captures the look of the vehicle nicely.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Included plow build adds more value to set.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Droid arms part use is a weaker connection for the plow, a different clip system would have looked better and would be less prone to breaking.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Great polybag set, definitely pick this one up. The colours and the design just really stand out to me as being a really good Polybag build. It&rsquo;s also a nice unique new vehicle design as tractors are not commonly found in LEGO, scale would look well in a MOC too.</p>
