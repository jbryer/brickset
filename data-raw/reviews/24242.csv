<h3>Box</h3>

<p>No box here. Just built the plane with bricks from other sets.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes with 2 instruction booklets. They are thicker than previous mid-size sets: each book covers the complete model. 114 pages for the main model, 107 for the B-model, a Harrier kind of fighter jet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The water plane is first of all offering a decent collection of white panels in all kinds. 2 big 5x11 panels, 2 small 3x11 panels, 7(!) white 3-5x11 trapezoid panels and a bunch of curved wing panels in both white and red. Besides the white panels, the part collection is not very special.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The plane was built by my 5 year old son. As trend with Lego, the current instruction books take very small steps at a time. For 5 year olds it is great, for older fans it is a bit too much. Often you can exactly predict what is on the next spread.<br />
The build is fun, with not much repetition and lots of tiny surprises, like how the top section is hold in place, the steering mech, how the tail is tied together and the propellor wheel mech.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>From what I had seen on Brickset or in the Lego brochure, I was not very enthusiastic. But when you build the plane, it looks awesome. It is not so big: the 9394 jet-plane was bigger, and its ancestor the legendary 8855 propeller plane dwarfs it even though it has an almost identical part count. But this plane looks very refreshing. Guess the thing that tanks it in the promotional pictures are the stickers. They ought very ugly to me, and without having the original set but just the parts, there was no way to test the model with stickers.<br />
Yet the thing is it looks fantastic without. I think it looks BETTER without. I believe it is the best looking technic plane in Lego history if you keep the stickers off!</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This is another aspect where the plane shines. It offers the same functionality as the 8855 prop plane and more! You can operate ailerons and tail wings with a realistic stick and ditto movements. The weird thing is the stick is located in the tail of the plane. It seems weird, but it allows easy play, impossible with the 8855.<br />
It is also very nice to see the propeller operate when you roll it on a table. Far from realistic, yet the kids dig it.</p>

<p><img alt=""Water loading lid"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42040-2.jpg"" style=""width: 1000px; height: 665px;"" /><br />
Last but not least: what seemed very weird, extinguishing water in the form of 8 translucent round bricks, gives most fun. You can open the top lid, load the plane with the bricks, and spray them over any fictional fire in your Lego village. To do this, you press the tiny grey &quot;button&quot; made of a ball coupling as seen below. My boys really love it!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>So far this set has no review here. Weird. It is a sleeper. A hidden gem. The only possible flaw is that it is a little overpriced. The 9394 was like 35&euro; for a comparable size model: little less parts, but the plane was bigger, probably because it used a lot of 5x11 and 3x11 size wing panels. This plane is 50&euro;, at least 10&euro; too much.</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2016-01-03T19:41:27.62Z","It's a bird... it's a plane... it's a FIRE PLANE!","<p>Hello, denizens of Brickset! It&#39;s my last day of winter break, so I thought I would review my best Christmas present: 42040 Fire Plane. This Technic set is one I had been looking forward to for months, so does it hold up to expectations, or crash and burn?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same size as the box for Master Wu Dragon, so a rectangle roughly 13 inches by 8 inches by 2 inches. It&#39;s very deep, and has a subtle background that looks far better than older Technic boxart. The instructions are two glue-bound booklets, one for each model. Yes, the B-Model instructions are included; we&#39;ll get back to that later. Paper quality is very good, and the instructions are clearly printed and have a mistake: while building the gear mechanism in the tail, they show two of the cross-shaped gear things occupying the same space, which is physically impossible. It&#39;s fixed in the next step, though.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a great selection of assorted Technic parts. I don&#39;t personally have a ton of it, so this is a very nice parts pack to me and my limited collection. The following parts appear in less than 10 sets at time of writing:<br />
-Beam 1M w/ 2 axles in black (4)<br />
-The two smallest panels in red (one of each)<br />
-Pin connecter tube 2M in silver (2)<br />
-8M rotor blade in dark bluish grey (3)<br />
-6572 steering arm with ball in light bluish grey (1)<br />
-the front wheels, which are a variant of the DeLorean wheels with an axle hole, in white (2)<br />
-angular beam 4x6 in white (4)<br />
-3x11 curved panel, old style, in white (2)<br />
-5x11, 3x11, and 5x11 angled flat panels in white (2 of each)<br />
As well as a bunch of useful stuff like gears, white panels, the small gearbox things, and a single steering link.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took about 1 hr 20 mins for each model. The build was quite interesting, especially the tail. I don&#39;t have much more to say about it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is really big for the piece count. It has a wingspan of more than a foot and the fuselage is slightly longer. There are 3 functions (well, actually 4, but the last one is manual.) This is very important: THE MODEL IS NOT MOTORIZED. Contrary to what the box would suggest, it is not. Now, the functions:</p>

<p>-The rudder is moveable by hand. It has a lot of friction, so I don&#39;t use it much.<br />
-The wheels are linked to a V2 piston engine and the front propellor, so when you push it along a surface, the propellor spins and the engine, well, moves. The gear ratio for the whole structure is 1:1, so how fast the propellor spins is exactly how fast the wheels turn.<br />
-The plane drops water (8 2x2 round bricks in transparent light blue) when a button on the top is pushed. To load the water back in, push down on the front of the cabin roof to lift it up.<br />
-The elevators and ailerons are controlled by one joystick located in the tail. Move it back and forth to tilt the rear elevators, and move it sideways to move the ailerons. And yes, you can move both at the same time.</p>

<p>IMPRESSIONS (credit to Sariel for this)</p>

<p>-The plane has a lot of details, many of them stickers. The sides and the pontoons have a red wavy design. There are navigation lights on the wings and rudder, and landing lights on the front of the wings. The cockpit has the standard blue seats, and there are red and white stripes on the propellor to create a cool effect when it spins.<br />
-The problem with the angled panels is the open edges. So the wings look like they have air intakes all along the leading edge, which is wrong. This does allow a more realistically shaped rear, however.<br />
-The steps leading up to the cockpit seem unfinished, and the cockpit itself lacks opening doors, controls, or basically any detail whatsoever. The seats themselves are actually part of the mechanism to drop the water bricks.<br />
-The fuselage slowly tapers from 7 studs wide to 5 studs wide. This is accomplished by having two panels hinged back and locked in place with rubber axle connectors, which is very clever.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>PROS:<br />
-Very large model for the price<br />
-Excellent parts pack for those getting into Technic<br />
-Fun and cleverly designed functions<br />
-Very few gaps, which are difficult to avoid in Technic models<br />
-Awesome-looking stickers<br />
-Very playable</p>

<p>CONS:<br />
-Difficult to find in stores, if there&#39;s not a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us or a LEGO Brand Retail store nearby<br />
-Zero parts that are actually new<br />
-Has no convenient place to pick up and swoosh<br />
-Stickers can be hard to apply</p>

<p>If you like Technic and flying machines, this is the set for you. Of my limited collection of Technic sets, about six sets, this is my favorite. I recommend this set to any Technic fan who likes aircraft, needs parts, or is looking for a fun model.</p>

"DrFrankenstein","2016-02-13T18:21:13.543Z","Surprisingly good looking plane","<p>The fire plane is one of the best looking Technic planes of all times. It features a sharp look, attractive color scheme, plenty of functionality, and great playability in a mid-size Technic package. As a previous reviewer observed the set with the secondary model seems to be a modern take on the 8855 from the 1980s. The main airplane looks a lot like a Cessna seaplane with the wings mounted high on the fuselage. The model looks great from all angles. In fact, I completely agree that the stickers on this model don&#39;t add much to its looks. Surprisingly, the set includes a booklet with the secondary model instructions (we have gotten used to having to download these).</p>

<p>The functions of the plane are very well selected to include the usual aileron and elevator control and some more unique functions such as the propeller drive and the cargo dumping. All the functions work flawlessly too which is not something one can say for all Technic sets out there.</p>

<p>The build is pleasant in general with few if any surprises. One needs to pay close attention to the pin placements as it is easy to make a mistake that would require undoing a large portion of the plane. For some reason I found the pins to be much more resistant to snapping into the beams than I am used to. Not sure if it is just me or LEGO has made some small changes to the molds that cause this. One other thing that I noticed is that the blue elements were not consistent in color. I thought that LEGO had resolved these small quality issues once and for all, but that does not seem to be the case. The instructions booklet also had noticeable quality issues - the shade of gray used for the light gray parts changed dramatically page to page varying from very light gray to extremely dark (almost black). Also, some of the pages were glued together. These issues are the reason why I can&#39;t give a 5-star score to the build for this set.</p>

<p>Overall, I like the fire plane very much. It is one of the best Technic planes of all times. The set provides a very rewarding model in a reasonably priced package. The airplane looks great with and without the stickers, holds solid, and packs lots of functions. There are some minor quality issues with my copy of the set, but nothing I could not work around. The fire plane is one of the most attractive offerings from the 2015 Technic lineup and worth the price. This one is a keeper.</p>

"bitbamboo","2016-07-06T12:00:15.613Z","Amazing B and C model (Duck)","<p>Technic models are much more sturdy than system ones. This makes them perfect for parents to build and kids to&nbsp;play with them, just think on the undestroyable&nbsp;pull-back racers</p>

<p>This set packs&nbsp;two excellent planes with many play features each allowing AFOL&nbsp;parents to enjoy building and children to enjoy playing... and asking for upgrades. In addition to that, this set&nbsp;is not so gender-specific as the typical machinery, appealing both girls and boys</p>

<p>I decided to make this review mainly to share photos for the B model (jet) and information about the &quot;almost-official&quot; C model - Duck published by the set designer, Milan Reindl (grohl666&nbsp;in Youtube and brickshelf). He presents the official&nbsp;set in the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZpV_Yi-I_M"">designer&#39;s video</a></p>

<h3><strong>Box / Instructions</strong></h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The booklets for both the hydroplane (number 1 or A model) and the jet (number 2 or B&nbsp;model) are included. They are quality bond&nbsp;and&nbsp;easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box is well designed, devoting the front to the hydroplane including some captions of the play features and the back to the jet, with captions as well</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing really relevant.&nbsp;Less gears and specialized parts&nbsp;that I&#39;d liked but the models do not need&nbsp;any more. In fact the only new&nbsp;part is the versatile 7 units of&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6097440"">&nbsp;6097440: Panel With Angle 5X11</a>&nbsp;in white that appeared later in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42052-1/Heavy-Lift-Helicopter"">42052 - Heavy Lift&nbsp;Helicopter</a>&nbsp;(just 2)</p>

<p>There are two common, but&nbsp;very useful, pieces that can be used for making small&nbsp;differentials,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4558692"">4558692: Beam 3M &Oslash;4.85 W. Fork</a> and&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4238840"">4238840: Double Snap 2M, &Oslash; 4,85</a>&nbsp;using the 3 conical wheels provided <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-6589"">6589</a></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fantastic! Delightful! The kids asked for the jet (B model) just by looking&nbsp;at the box so I started with it. This build is not complicated and requires low dexterity</p>

<p>The hydroplane (A model) instead has some steps where two big intermediate models&nbsp;comes together&nbsp;and&nbsp;others&nbsp;where you have to pin down a gear in place while inserting a couple of pieces. This&nbsp;requires&nbsp;a bit more of dexterity and big hands, but probably a 9 y.o. can handle it.</p>

<h3>The completed model - Hydroplane</h3>

<p>I confirm the comments from the other reviews, it looks fantastic. The half pontoons do not looks bad at all in my opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is great to&nbsp;play with. You can move the wheels while swooshing it around to make the propeller rotate, throw the water and twist flaps and tail</p>

<p>It is a bit big for my 6 y.o. to handle it comfortably while swooshing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I include a top view&nbsp;image to give an idea of its size and squared shape in&nbsp;cm. (in case I haven&#39;t inserted it right, see <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/143761291@N07/with/27485372694/"">flickr</a>&nbsp;for full resolution)</p>

<h3>The completed model - Jet</h3>

<p>Absolutely great. In fact I wanted to add&nbsp;pictures of this model in&nbsp;Brickset so everyone&nbsp;can see how good it is. Even without stickers!</p>

<p><img alt=""42040 B model Jet, top view with cm."" src=""https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7306/27485019253_78cf9e553c_o.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 332px;"" /></p>

<p>The cockpit admits a minifigure by just pinning at&nbsp;the seat&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4143005"">4143005: Connector Peg W. Knob</a>&nbsp;and this made my 6yo really happy. In fact, I used one spare from the set</p>

<p><img alt=""42050 view with minifigure in the cockpit"" src=""https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7320/27485372734_6a4b8f32d4_o.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 332px;"" /></p>

<p>And this model is easier to swoosh&nbsp;around for his small hands because of the shape. He likes&nbsp;a lot the retractable landing gear and he have asked for an&nbsp;upgrade&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;the water dropping feature of the hydroplane</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7124/28022379331_43dff805dd_o.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 100px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7446/28065805866_4a938a2ec4_o.jpg"" style=""height: 100px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://c6.staticflickr.com/8/7650/27485140093_ae5c89fbac_o.jpg"" style=""height: 100px;"" /></p>

<h3>The completed model - Duck</h3>

<p>I normally wouldn&#39;t mention C models but the fact that it was published, privately, by the set designer and because it&nbsp;is so out-of-the-technic-theme&nbsp;it deserves a few pictures here. It is great to see it rolling and <strong>moving the head, wings and legs</strong></p>

<p>The instructions are provided by <a href=""http://www.brickshelf.com/cgi-bin/gallery.cgi?f=563487"">grohl666&nbsp;pictures in brickshelf</a> and a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVlVv24FjE4"">video</a>. I have completed them with another <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFeKukBwF-w"">video</a>&nbsp;just in case someone needs additional help.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great building and re-building value and great playing value. At&nbsp;50 &euro; is a bit pricey but as it is about to retire (I&#39;m writing this on July 2016) is is easy to fins an offer between 40 - 50 &euro;</p>

<p>The only downside has been to dismount&nbsp;the models, they are so sturdy and well built that it requires careful&nbsp;review to find out&nbsp;how to progress unbuilding&nbsp;any of the planes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highly recommended</p>

"HuskyDynamics","2018-04-09T01:17:57.727Z","This plane is so cool!","<p>Really, it is!&nbsp; There are so many little bits that make it come together to look like a high-quality plane.&nbsp; It has a function where, if you push a button on top of the cockpit, the bottom opens and &quot;water&quot; falls out!&nbsp; And another thing that LEGO completely forgot to advertise: IT HAS WORKING CONTROLS!!!!&nbsp; That little red lever just forward of the tail lets you control both the elevators on the tail and the ailerons on the primary wings!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other build is also neat:&nbsp; A jet aircraft with landing gear that retracts when you twist the engine (another thing LEGO forgot), an opening cockpit and fuselage, as well as a little fuel rig?&nbsp; It&#39;s great!&nbsp; My only complaints are that the stickers end up in some odd-looking places, and the boarding ladder thing is kind of unnecessary.&nbsp; Also, you kind of have to work through the instructions backwards to take apart the engine of the main build plane (although this means that it is a very solid plane).&nbsp; Otherwise, LEGO has done it again with the Fire Plane!</p>
