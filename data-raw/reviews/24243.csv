<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The size of the box represents the price of this set. A smaller one would have been sufficient.<br />
Instruction comes as one booklet for the main model only.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are sorted into several bags that are numbered 1 to 4 to identify building steps:</p>

<p>1. carriage</p>

<p>2. drive transmission and gear</p>

<p>3. chassis</p>

<p>4. panels for chassis, arm and grappler</p>

<p>There are 90 track elements - more than even in set 8043.<br />
The turntable comes in two parts, it has to be assembled by the customer. This seems to be a new part that has skewed tooth. It can be driven by a vertical mounted gear wheel as in this model.</p>

<p>I set the sticker set aside and after a short time i noted that the sheet (8 x 18 cm&sup2;) had begun to coil up.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The first module is the carriage. Left and right track are powered simultaneously thus the crane can only moved straight forward and backwards. Care should be taken to get the gear train running smooth. The finished module gives a nice impression of the final size.</p>

<p>Next is the gear train that operates the motorized functions. There are new (to me) three-wide clutch elements (http://brickset.com/parts/6100932, http://brickset.com/parts/6100931, and http://brickset.com/parts/6100930). I guess that the odd width is better suited to match studless grid dimensions.</p>

<p>During the first steps of building module 3 the gear train is connected to the carriage.</p>

<p>Step 4 mainly consists of smaller building units like drivers cabin, chassis panels, modular crane arm elements, grabbing hook. These are preassembled and then mounted to the model.</p>

<p>The claw is - except for the connection to the winch - identical to that from 42006 Excavator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In brief: huge.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.boverhaus.de/~fafnir/Brickshelf/42042.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 554px;"" /><br />
I don&#39;t have the 8043 at hand but I believe it is bigger than then Motorized Excavator.<br />
The blue and white colour scheme is nice.<br />
There are four levers for the motorized operation of the model:<br />
1. Winch for boom<br />
2. Overall motion<br />
3. Rotation<br />
4. Winch for claw</p>

<p>Each of the levers can switch forward and backward operation. Thus there is no need to change direction using the switch on the battery box (as in some other models in this price range).</p>

<p>The movement of tracks is rather slow and, on a smooth surface, jerky. Perhaps the Technic Coupling is occasionally slipping.<br />
This also happens easily if the claw is held when the string for either winch or boom is retracted. Lifting capability seems to be limited.</p>

<p>The claw is opened and closed by manual operation.<br />
<br />
The single boom elements are quite simple to build from only a few basic parts. Therefore further extension can be easily made. The carriage seems to be stable enough to support.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again: the big plus of the model is its size. Compared to its smaller companion 8288 it seems to be much more playable. To me the former Crawler Crane appeared to be more of a model than a play toy.</p>

<p>Minus:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Manual operation of the claw. At least it can easily replaced by a hook or other lifting gear as the claw is attached by means of two pins only.</li>
	<li>The model cannot be pushed on its tracks when the clutch is disengaged. There is too much friction in the drive train.</li>
</ul>

"FlagsNZ","2015-08-28T11:17:03.967Z","An accurate Technic Crawler Crane with an incredibly intuitive gear box system","<p>42042 Crawler Crane is the second large Technic set for&nbsp;2015 and surprisingly, despite being a crane, it has&nbsp;only three insignificant yellow parts.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a large box with several images of the finished model. The rear of the box shows the B Model - Mobile Tower Crane. The stickers indicate that both&nbsp;cranes are part of the&nbsp;&nbsp;MT Lifting Service. This likely honours&nbsp;Michael T. Jeppesen as the LEGO designer.</p>

<p>The instructions come in one bound book of 233 pages.</p>

<p>I was somewhat surprised to find that a large section of the instructions has been jumbled up and printed backwards. Pages 171 to 194 are printed upside down and in reverse order.</p>

<p>(Edit: as of Friday 11 Oct, I received an updated edition of the instruction book with the printing error fixed from the&nbsp;LEGO Service Centre)</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/617/20757571048_fe5d7cd843_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts come in numbered bags for the four sections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bags numbered 1 build the crawler chassis.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5703/20322943544_338424577c_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There is another new <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6109283"">large turntable</a> which has been seen in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42043-1/Mercedes-Benz-Arocs-3245"">42043&nbsp;Mercedes Benz Arocs&nbsp;3245</a>.</p>

<p>Bags numbered 2 build the main gear box and this forms the basis of the crane body.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5774/20935779942_698e7cc9a3_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There is an&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6000564"">L Motor</a> powering the set.</p>

<p>The bags numbered 3 link the crane sections together. The crane body is beginning to take shape and the boom foot section and gantry are in place.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/679/20322942904_c6395c6035_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Bags numbered 4 complete the set. The Crane body takes shape and the boom is complete.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/667/20920348876_70265b5eb9_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set took a couple of nights to build and was a pleasure to construct. The only confusion occurred when arriving at the mixed up section of the instructions. I am so used to LEGO being meticulously correct that these sorts of situations lead me to question the build before suspecting an error made by&nbsp;LEGO.</p>

<p>The crane comes with a manually operated grab that is exactly the same as the grab found on <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42006-1/Excavator"">42006 Excavator</a>.</p>

<p>The grab detaches from the lifting hook by removing two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4184169"">tow bar pins</a>.</p>

<p>The hook is similar to&nbsp;the one found on <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42009-1/Mobile-Crane-MK-II"">42009 Mobile Crane Mk II</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/623/20935776622_7831e25098_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>One of the most striking features of this set is the simple intuitive way that the gear box operates&nbsp;to give this set its functions. There are two gear levers; the left lever operates the boom&nbsp;guy line&nbsp;and crawler tracks while the right lever operates the hoist rope and slewing.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/711/20952930571_823f393c58_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5786/20757469350_8fcb81057b_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>If the string is rove on correctly then the direction of the lever matches the intended direction of the winch.</p>

<p>Also the gearing is organised in such a way that when the boom guy line&nbsp;is payed out at the same time as the&nbsp;hook is hoisted the hook stays at the same height but the operating radius increases as the hook moves further away or vice versa.</p>

<p>The gear levers operate the winches when they are in the outer positions and drive the tracks and slewing when in the inner positions.</p>

<p>One drawback of the design is that there is only one drive axle for the tracks and therefore you can&#39;t steer the crane.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/763/20322939914_6ecd9c5d46_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>As can be seen, the crane cab pivots upwards giving the crane driver a better view of the load on the hook. This is archived&nbsp;through the use of a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6129364"">friction cylinder</a>&nbsp;under the cab.</p>

<p>The dominant colour of this set is blue and it contains the first instance of a&nbsp;blue <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6108906"">Bowed Panel&nbsp;3x11x2</a>.</p>

<p>The boom guy line terminates on a&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4184169"">tow bar pin</a>&nbsp;on the gantry. It is possible to gain some more mechanical advantage&nbsp;on the guy line by terminating the line on the equaliser&nbsp;bridle although you will need 20% more string in order to lower the boom.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/766/20952927271_ba1dcbf1d7_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The gantry back hitch can also be relocated further up the gantry. This enables the boom to top up further thus reducing the minimum operating radius of the crane.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5737/20935771422_f978028fb2_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Having a smaller operating radius will increase the lifting capacity of the crane.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have enjoyed building this set and 2015&#39;s companion Technic set,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42043-1/Mercedes-Benz-Arocs-3245"">42043&nbsp;Mercedes Benz&nbsp;Arocs 3245</a>. That they are both not yellow adds to the joy as I now have a great selection of Technic parts in different colours.</p>

<p>The set drives well but is rather jumpy. When the drive train and slewing is out of gear it is possible to push the set around easily.</p>

<p>I am sure that this set could be made to operate remotely. There is room under the track chassis for two <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8883-1/M-Motor"">M Motors</a>&nbsp;so there is an opportunity to add steering capability. Three <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8884-1/IR-Receiver"">IR Receivers</a> and three motors will fit in the gear box cavity.</p>

<p>I would have preferred a new grab design and there could have been a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/70644"">metal hook</a>.</p>

<p>I plan to build some additional crane boom sections to give this set a greater&nbsp;height lifting capability.</p>

<p>Overall, I am impressed with the accuracy of this build. I have worked at sea transporting crawler cranes between the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Island"">North and South Islands</a>&nbsp;in ships and have experienced loading cranes dismantled into their various components to lighten&nbsp;the load. This crane accurately resembles real world crawler cranes.</p>

<p>Added to that is the ease in which the gear box operates that makes driving this set a breeze.</p>

<p>Have some fun in the construction industry by building 42042 Crawler Crane.</p>

"martiniman","2015-10-28T17:47:16.137Z","Awesome huge crane with unique gearbox!","<h2>Box</h2>

<p>I did not have the box. I build the model from my parts. I only had to order a few since there are not many unique parts, mostly the curved panels and some extra liftarms.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>The book is nice and thick. There are only very few occasions where it has 2 mirrored elements in a separate series of steps. I prefer to be informed about this and build the two mirrored elements at the same time. Problem is instructions are written for 5 year olds even when a set shows age 11-16 on the box. I really prefer studded-technic manuals as they are less &quot;dumb&quot;. So lets have this built by my 5 year old son, for him modern style instructions are great...</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The set contains very few special parts. It just contains a big amount of some. To build this from other sets, you will be short of blue 15 and 7 hole beams (40 and 27!), small grey rims (you need 28!) and small 1+2 number blue wing panels (6 and 5 pieces used). You also need a few rare parts like the &quot;flag&quot; to keep the wires from choking up the gears, the cylinder to put up the cabin and, 4 grey cross axles with eyes and off course the 4 new blue curved panels.</p>

<p>If you buy it, you will like the blue curved panels, blue wings and tons of blue liftarms.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>It is a very nice to build crawler crane. It takes about 5 hours, there is not too much repetation and the base and gear box are awesome. The only little tricky thing is to put the cable in the right position.</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>The crane looks terrific. It is huge, it looks very industrial, stickers are totally not needed as the colour scheme and shape is very impressive already.</p>

<p>Playability is great. I never saw Lego make such an excellent gearbox before. Usually you have to mess with the awkward battery box switch to change directions. Here all directions can be controlled mechanically! Yet the gear box is still pretty compact. Awesome engineering! It has the WOW of the 8043 when it comes to controls.</p>

<h2>Issues</h2>

<p>The gripper is pretty awkward. Almost nothing fits in. It limits playability. You probably better change it for a regular hook. The operation is also too slow, you need to many turns to open it.</p>

<p>The new turntable is worse than the old. It might be a little stiffer, but that does not matter in this build as the upper part slides on a frame in the base. What really annoys is that LEGO changed the outer gear to a beveled one. If you use it with a 90 degree gear to drive it, like this model does, it will constantly slip if there is a load on the crane. With the old parallel driving gear you never had this problem. So turning around with a load is almost impossible.</p>

<p>Besides I don&#39;t like to have the huge weight of the upper part slide on liftarms in the base. It really ruins your bricks with circular scratches. The 42009 crane had a similar problem. Maybe we need an even larger turntable.</p>

<p>I miss the option to steer the base. It makes sense Lego thought 4 functions are killer already, yet in the 8043 they managed coaxial drive of the base!</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The issues are very minor though, and most can be fixed. What remains is a huge, impressive and fun to play crane and your collection of bricks gets more in balance on the colour spectrum!</p>

"TeraMedia","2015-11-09T16:06:22.57Z","Much more fun than 42009 MK II Crane","<p>I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have said.&nbsp; This review is intended to augment or update what they have written.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>My instructions did not come garbled, or with some pages reversed.&nbsp; Shipped from Lego, it appears that they have now fixed that problem.</p>

<p>For the most part, the instructions were easy.&nbsp; But after so many pages, I missed the 1x3 white plates in the rear of the gearbox and had to go back to re-add them.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<ul>
	<li>More treads than you will probably ever need.</li>
	<li>Abundant blue technic parts and panels</li>
	<li>Complete Power Functions capabilities with a motor and ample gearbox parts.</li>
	<li>A few oddball white parts that are not numerous enough for a full model of anything, nor in pairs to allow for symmetry.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Slow and steady.&nbsp; My biggest complaint is not so much with the build, as with what it takes to <em>un</em>build.&nbsp; The model uses 5M cross-axles with stop ends and 3M cross-axles to attach the tread modules to the base.&nbsp; Undoing this requires that you take a short (3M or 4M) cross-axle and use it to push out the 5Ms, which are between the treads, underneath the model.&nbsp; This is exacerbated by the fact that the complete model is massive, so you can&#39;t just pick it up and do this.&nbsp; You need to prop it on something, drape the boom part over something, let the strings get tangled up a bit while you work, and <em>then</em> you can - with a lot of effort - get these 5M ended cross-axles out.</p>

<p>Other than that, the build is pretty good.&nbsp; It makes use of a lot of &quot;push-in&quot; style construction, such as using 3M pegs or 3M pegs with cross axles or cross axle holes to combine modules (as it does so with the expander boom module).</p>

<p>The most tedious part of the build is assembling the treads.&nbsp; There are 90 pieces here, so your fingers are going to get sore.</p>

<p>The most complicated part of the build - in my opinion - is dealing with the strings and dangling parts as you complete final assembly on the boom and tie off the string to the attachment ball.</p>

<p>The most delicate part of the build is attaching the exterior blue plating to the gear module.&nbsp; You have to match a bunch of pins and push a fairly large module onto what is already a large base.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Outstanding.&nbsp; Looks great.&nbsp; PLAYS great.&nbsp; One reviewer commented on the jerkiness of motion when going forward or backward.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think this is gears skipping so much as just elasticity and slack in the drive train.&nbsp; I actually like the jerkiness of the motion - I think it adds to it, just as a real treaded vehicle can be jerky when moving on a hard surface such as asphalt.</p>

<p>The gearing is pushing the limits of what power and torque the motor can bear.&nbsp; Movement is slow for all functions except rotation (slew?), which is *almost* too fast... but not quite.</p>

<p>A lot of reviews bash the claw.&nbsp; I actually tried to use it to pick up some small Lego models lying around on the floor, and it worked great.&nbsp; I do wish it was motorized, but understand how much complexity that would have added.</p>

<p>The lack of steering is a big drawback to playability.&nbsp; I took it upon myself to add a small set of gears and a transmission lever to the base so that I can run both treads in the same direction, just one of the treads (with the other in neutral), or both treads in opposite directions.&nbsp; My gearing turns out not to be strong enough to handle the reverse-direction configuration on carpeted surfaces because I get some gear-skipping. But it otherwise works pretty well.&nbsp; I do recommend considering making a similar change to improve playability if you intend to play with this model.&nbsp; And if you do... do so before you add the gearing module and treads to the rest of the base.&nbsp; It will be much easier to work with.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have a bunch of old Expert Builder sets, and also the Technic MK II Crane (42009), the racing motor cycle and this one.&nbsp; This set has much better playability than the Crane for a variety of reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The motor moves the whole model.</li>
	<li>The gearbox can be used to reverse each action direction, without switching the powerbox.</li>
	<li>It does not feel as if the parts are over-strained, as it did with the MK II.</li>
	<li>It isn&#39;t so big as to be cumbersome to play with.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for aesthetics, this model looks just as good as the motorcycle, given what it is.&nbsp; You expect to see a lot of internal workings on a piece of heavy machinery, and with this model you&nbsp;do, but things are kind of where they should be with the winches on top, the motor an gears inside, etc, and the Technic plating does a decent job of emulating real-world sheetmetal.&nbsp; Some of the other Technic models using such plating look more fudged in my opinion.</p>

<p>Have fun with this one.&nbsp; Add steering to improve playability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Add other modules to replace the claw if you wish.&nbsp; Lengthen the boom if you like (it&#39;s easy, as long as the string is long enough), and then go play!</p>

"AyCarrumba","2016-08-20T18:45:30.83Z","Crawler Crane fits all your heavy lifting needs!","<p>I&#39;m a self avowed big technic kit fan, and I spent my birthday money on this set. Did it live up to expectations?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The big, flat box is thinner than the AROCS but looks fantastic with good product photos. The instruction manual is 1 single book and a sticker sheet. The instructions in mine are &#39;fixed&#39; with no backwards pages and perfectly straight forwards to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The tracks are great and you get an L motor, battery box and 4 sets of the new clutch system. However, with no actuators and 2 spools controlling the main crane functions you&#39;re actually a bit limited in construction possibilities if this is your first or only Technic set. That said, you will never again want for 15 Stud beams, unless you want a colour other than blue....</p>

<h3>Minifigures - Nope!</h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is modular and very engaging. The cosmetics are minimal but very effective, and spread throughout the build, so you ever feel like you&#39;re just &#39;finishing off&#39; with some boring additional railings. I love the vents and exhaust, and the cabin tilts adding a little interest.<br />
<br />
However, the fiendishly clever but actually quite understandable gearbox is star of the show here. It make it clear how the new 3L clutch connectors/dog gears make gearbox construction much more intuitive and simple. Ok, not simple, but not dark magic either. With forward and reverse of all functions it allows great play and also a nice insight into how to build these features in to MOC&#39;s. It is probably the best implementation of any Lego gearbox I&#39;ve yet seen although it doesn&#39;t quite have the technical intrigue of the AROCS or 42009 Mobile Crane MKII. The four outputs don&#39;t have convoluted routing or obscure gearing. One simply drives a sprocket onto the outer edge of the turntable to spin the superstructure, the other passes through the middle to drive the tracks (meaning only forwards/aft drive is possible). The last 2 power separate spools to control the boom and grab. It&#39;s very clever engineering and results in a highly playable model.</p>

<p>The boom and tracks manage not to be repetitive to build and the Grab is a thing of beauty.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is excellent to play with and succeeds aestheticly as well. It&#39;s also huge!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/uYB4Uv9.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 740px;"" /></p>

<p>Playability is off the chart with this one. It moves, it grabs, it spins, it lifts! Plenty of fun for both me and my young son. I&#39;ll also add that the controls and movement are remarkably smooth, in my build at least, with no real &#39;jerking&#39; or excessive lash under power. Perhaps it just needs careful assembly (not that I&#39;m a wizard) but build with care everything works smoothly and quickly.<br />
<br />
The one let down is the B-model, which is some kind of fantasy no-mans land of mobile tower crane. It&#39;s just a re-working of this crane only more unwieldy. Personally I&#39;d have liked to see something a little more adventurous and making good use of the tracks - I feel like a Bulldozer with Fore/Aft and Turn left/Turn Right gearbox controls is possible with the parts provided and that&#39;s what I&#39;ll try and build. I think it&#39;s the lack of actuators that prevented them doing anything more with this set, which is a shame as the A model is very strong indeed.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A really wonderful large scale technic build with robust engineering, great looks and a BIG BOX! At the &pound;70 it&#39;s currently available for it&#39;s a real bargain and one to lay down for Christmas.</p>
