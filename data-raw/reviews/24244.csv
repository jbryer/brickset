"Freekysch","2015-08-03T07:18:04.67Z","Awesome Technic truck ! Must have for all Technic fans.","<p>When I saw the first picture of the new Mercedes Arocs&nbsp;I immediately knew that I have to buy this set as soon as it hit the shelves. A few days ago I found it and let me say, after 12 hours of endless fun, the outcome is epic. This is an awesome set with great functions and new V2 pneumatics.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is huge and heavy. It has some nice graphics on it with the truck and its functions and as on any other licensed set some pictures with the real truck. You also see this set comes with PF and new Pneumatic parts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Being the largest Technic set ever, the parts assortment is huge. First, you get the new pneumatic stuff (cylinders, redesigned pump), an L motor and some new interesting pieces used for the outriggers. You also get 12 wheels and tires. The other parts are cool too, lots of white pieces for the cab and lots of grey ones for the tipper. Oh, I almost forgot, all the wheels have suspension - this is a first too, no other flagship truck has this.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was wonderful and enjoyable. I was not in a rush and it took me 12 hours to complete this set. The instruction were clear and I had no problem in building the model. As having so much parts, the build is divided in 6 steps&nbsp;- you get 6 different number of bags with pieces. The most difficult part of the build was the pneumatic crane. You have so little space to work with and so many pneumatic hoses that it gets frustrating sometimes, but the result is awesome so all the hard work pays off.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Just looking at it, the completed model is a great set with awesome looks and very nice details. The features and the functions also make this set stand out, you get full suspension, very nicely detailed cab, epic pneumatic crane, cool outriggers and stunning looks overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is one of the best Technic sets ever ! It looks beautiful and the functions are great. It is not 100% perfect, but then again, which set is ?</p>

<p>Strong points:</p>

<p>+ awesome design and looks|<br />
+ new pneumatics parts<br />
+ full&nbsp;suspension on all wheels and double rear wheels<br />
+ nice details on the cab</p>

<p>Weak points:</p>

<p>- too big space between the wheels and the mud guards<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, get it as soon as possible ! In my opinion this will remain in the history of Technic flagships.</p>

"FlagsNZ","2015-08-03T08:25:44.333Z","A true Flagship set for a new range of Pneumatic System Technic sets","<p>Often, sets are described as being a Flagship for a theme when they are really only the largest set of the theme for that year.</p>

<p><a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42043-1/Mercedes-Benz-Arocs-3245"">42043:&nbsp;Mercedes-Benz Arocs 3245</a>&nbsp;truly&nbsp;deserves the <em>Flagship&nbsp;</em>title as not only is this set the largest Technic set released in 2015 containing the greatest parts count in the Technic&nbsp;theme but it also introduces a new series of Pneumatic&nbsp;System.</p>

<p>Having recently travelled&nbsp;to the UK, I took the opportunity of&nbsp;calling&nbsp;into the <a href=""http://stores.lego.com/en-gb/stores/uk/london-westfield"">LEGO Shop at </a>&nbsp;<a href=""http://stores.lego.com/en-gb/stores/uk/london-westfield"">Westfield </a><a href=""http://stores.lego.com/en-gb/stores/uk/london-westfield"">Shepherd&#39;s&nbsp;Bush</a>&nbsp;to see if this set was available. I knew the expected release date was 1 August but was relieved to find it available earlier than expected.</p>

<p>Read on to find out more about the lead set of a new category of&nbsp;Pneumatic&nbsp;functions.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>When buying the large Technic sets in the second half of the year, you know it will be in a big box. Containing 2793 parts, the box needs to be the same size as last year&#39;s&nbsp;<em>Flagship</em>&nbsp;Technic set <a href=""http://42030-1:%20Volvo%20L350F%20Wheel%20Loader"">42030 Volvo L350F Wheel Loader</a>.</p>

<p>The box has several images of the&nbsp;42043&nbsp;Mercedes-Benz Arocs 3245 and describes the new Pneumatic&nbsp;System on several sides. There is a new trade marked <em>Pneumatic System V2</em> logo on four of the sides and inside the flap.</p>

<p>The Pneumatic&nbsp;System V2 logo is similar in design to the trade marked&nbsp;Power Functions&nbsp;logo&nbsp;and I suspect that LEGO may soon introduce&nbsp;a&nbsp;new category&nbsp;of pneumatic products in the same way as you can currently purchase separate <a href=""http://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Power-Functions-ByCategory"">Power Functions</a>&nbsp;products.</p>

<p>The back of the box has images of the B model - Mercedes Benz Articulated Construction Truck although as of writing this review, there are no instructions available&nbsp;at the specified&nbsp;URL.</p>

<p>The box on display at the LEGO shop had a crushed corner and as I was soon to be travelling back to New Zealand I offered to purchase this as I planned to fold the box up in order to fit it in my luggage. The staff at the LEGO shop offered me a discounted&nbsp;purchase price due to the damaged&nbsp;box.</p>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;instructions are bound into a book containing 471 pages. In the past I have liked having the instructions to these large sets in several booklets but I have to admit that the binding quality makes the large single books far superior to the smaller stapled versions.</p>

<p>I need to use a bookmark to mark the point in the build where I get up and take a break.</p>

<p>There is a sticker sheet which is packed in the plastic bag along&nbsp;with the book.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3695/19625442444_ca643320b6_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The truck has a customised number plate which recognises&nbsp;Markus Kossman as the designer.</p>

<p>The stickers numbered 25 are for the B model - Mercedes Benz Arcos 1845.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts come in numbered bags matching the six building sections.</p>

<p>2015 has seen the introduction of several <em>universal</em> Technic parts which are likely to be seen in lots of sets in the coming years. I will describe these parts in the various sections of the build.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Set aside several evenings to build this model. The construction is broken down to six discrete modules which can be built independently of each other and assembled into the final model at the end.</p>

<p><strong>Module 1 &ndash; The front chassis</strong></p>

<p>The front chassis includes two independent front axles with individual suspension. The steering is driven by a hand of god mechanism which is camouflaged as the orange&nbsp;hazard lights. Twisting either light will steer the vehicle.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/398/20031931959_84ccb1b187_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Through clever linkages the front axle&nbsp;turns 28&deg; while the second axle turns 19&deg;.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/540/20224292751_a75dbb5b0c_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The front chassis houses the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/88003-1/L-Motor"">L&nbsp;Motor</a> and eventually the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8881-1/Battery-Box"">battery box</a>&nbsp;will slide down between the hazard lights.</p>

<p>The axles are suspended using three <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6055628"">Beam 4M Ball Cups</a>.</p>

<p>A new universal&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6089119"">Cross Axle 2M W Friction Pin</a>&nbsp;adds to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6015356"">2M Friction Pin W Cross Axle</a> introduced last year.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/279/20030504808_3c01265f72_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6109280"">new shovels</a> appear in bags 4.</p>

<p><strong>Module 2 &ndash; The rear chassis</strong></p>

<p>The rear chassis has duel differentials and independent suspension.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/395/20030528628_fd6201ca03_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Four <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6055628"">Beam 4M Ball Cups</a>&nbsp;holds the duel&nbsp;axle differential assembly. There is a compromise by using four <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4198367"">2M Rubber Dampers</a>&nbsp;to anchor these beams to the upper frame.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/506/20218545905_3286d0e1b9_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4530733"">6M Track Rods</a> are used accurately as <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panhard_rod"">Panhard Rods</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/281/19595878634_6decb6993d_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The rear axles have twin tyres for the first time since <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8285-1/Tow-Truck"">8285 Tow Truck</a> released in 2006.</p>

<p><strong>Module 3 &ndash; The gearbox and outriggers</strong></p>

<p>Module 3 builds the gear box with two outriggers underneath. The blue <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6133813"">Pneumatic Pump</a>&nbsp;is also embedded&nbsp;within&nbsp;the gearing.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3828/20031929939_1de21b9c67_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The outrigger jacks are activated by hand which is an improvement on the power driven jacks of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42009-1/Mobile-Crane-MK-II"">42009 Mobile Crane MkII</a>. These are strong enough to lift the truck.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/344/20192272226_f06576a8d0_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The outriggers&nbsp;are principally made up of two new&nbsp;parts; <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6114965"">15M</a><a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6114965""> Gear Rack Housing</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6114979"">14M Gear Rack</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the left are the old Gear Wheel, 2M Gear Shifter Ring and 2M Gear Shifter Connector while on the right are the new <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6100931"">3M Gear Shifter Ring</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6100930"">Gear Wheel</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6100932"">3M Gear Shifter Connector</a>. The new Gear Wheel can be put on either way round and the shifter ring is located more positively on the shifter connector than the former versions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note how the&nbsp;colours have been inverted for the&nbsp;new parts.</p>

<p><strong>Module 4 &ndash; The pneumatic arm</strong></p>

<p>The pneumatic arm is the most complex module of this set. Allocate some time and clear the desk when getting to this stage.</p>

<p>The new Pneumatic System V2 has three pneumatic rams and one air pump. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6099774"">small ram</a> is 5M long and extends to 7M. The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6099775"">medium</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6099776"">large</a> rams are both 11M long and extend to 17M.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/277/20249785305_f42441b6e9_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The air hoses have been colour coded with blue being the air supply, grey extends the rams and black retracts the rams.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/413/20030524008_aa20af62b7_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>A new large turntable without teeth on the inner ring is used as eight pneumatic tubes pass through the turntable. The four pairs of hoses are threaded into four coloured beams (Grey, Blue, Black and Yellow). It took two attempts to complete this step as when I threaded the hoses in the order of the instructions, the hoses got jumbled up in the turntable which affected the arm&rsquo;s ability to rotate. Instead, leave threading the hoses into their coloured beams until after all eight hoses are threaded through the turntable. This should ensure that the pairs of hoses are not tangled up.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/20224284331_c8e4bcc830_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>There are two pneumatic&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4237158"">two-way valves</a> on each side of the arm.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/543/20031919449_4a1efbcce0_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>On the image below is the new <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6109283"">Z60 Turntable</a>&nbsp;on the left with the old version on the right. The new turntable comes as two parts which are joined together and cannot be detached once joined.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/446/20030500010_ed5c7b57df_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p><strong>Module 5 &ndash; Cab</strong></p>

<p>Module 5 makes the front bumper and cab as two separate&nbsp;components.</p>

<p>The Mercedes Benz logo is printed on a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6113039"">No 6 Shield</a>.</p>

<p>There are two blue seats, a steering wheel and printed dashboard and an array of wing mirrors to help guide the driver.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/324/20030506620_ddc99f44ba_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p><strong>Module 6 &ndash; The tipper cargo tray</strong></p>

<p>The last module is the tipper tray.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/355/20218536025_fa31de104f_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All of the six modules can be built independently of each other and the full set can be assembled at the end.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/260/20224296601_52676f5344_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The left gear lever controls&nbsp;the outrigger arms and slewing the pneumatic arm. The arm is constrained to an arc of&nbsp;180&deg; to the rear. It will not slew forward.</p>

<p>The right gear lever controls the air pump and tipper tray.</p>

<p>There is a lock on the tipper tray gate.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/354/20210314282_83a1eaa9c2_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The&nbsp;left pneumatic controls operate the middle ram and the grab bucket.</p>

<p>The right pneumatic controls operate the lower and third rams.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3733/20031932929_b91d0a3948_o.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Finally, the cab doors open and the whole cab tips forward&nbsp;exposing the 6 cylinder engine for maintenance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/495/20030518068_df29e1d836_o.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set introduces a new Pneumatic System V2 powered functionality&nbsp;to the Technic range. It will enable complex MOCs to be built with functions that were otherwise difficult to produce mechanically. I hope that this set will lead the release of more sets in 2016 with pneumatic&nbsp;functions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set retails in the UK for the same price as last year&#39;s Volvo 350F Wheel Loader but in Europe and USA this set is cheaper than last year&#39;s set.</p>

<p>Here is an interesting comparison of the recommended prices for the&nbsp;<em>Flagship&nbsp;</em>Technic sets for the last three years:</p>

<p>2015: 42043&nbsp;&pound;169.99 / $229.99 / 199.99&euro;</p>

<p>2014: 42030&nbsp;&pound;169.99 / $249.99 / 219.99&euro;</p>

<p>2013: 42009&nbsp;&pound;149.99 / $219.99 / 199.99&euro;</p>

<p>I am currently building my set and do find it laboured. I wish Lego had put the correct components per section of the build in numbered bags.</p>

"martiniman","2015-08-18T20:42:46.663Z","Massive machine with awesome building experience.","<h2>Box</h2>

<p>This set comes in a huge box, slightly bigger thicker than the Unimog box, and almost as thick as the big Duplo train set. It is fully packed with numbered bags for the 6 phases of building.</p>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>The book is nice and thick. The instruction method does not match the age suggestion though. My 5 year old can build it with the book. That is in some way a positive thing, but for an older person it is pretty frustrating. Recommendations for LEGO:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make 1 part-list for the whole spread: parts for all steps on two pages can be collected at once. Old technic instructions do this perfectly!</li>
	<li>Make more use of repetition. You often build 2 or more times the same, or ALMOST the same. Combine these repetitive steps in shorter instructions.</li>
	<li>Also don&#39;t be afraid to say step 1 and step 2 are mirrored. I really like to built two mirrored parts at the same time. I understand you write out both, but you could make a warning like: step 5-8 on the next page are the mirrored steps of 1-4 on this page. Hey, we are 11 years and older! We know what &quot;mirrored&quot; means!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>With a huge collection of parts I always start with a calculation: what do the missing parts needed for a new model cost separate on Bricklink? In this case it would be close to the purchasing price, so that means purchasing the whole thing for me!<br />
Things that are worthy:</p>

<p>The new pneumatics:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 1x11 yellow cylinder, and very odd: 2 2x10.8 cylinders. Yes, those big ones are just 1mm shorter than 11 studs! In the extracted position the length difference is about 2.5 mm. So the thin one is 11 studs/17 studs, the thick one is 10.8 studs/16.6 studs.</li>
	<li>The tubes are modular now. With many previous models all tubes are cut to the needed length. Here there are many lengths used more than once. The longest routes are implemented by a series of connected standard size tubes! So you will get MANY tubes up to 28cm, but not very long ones as with the Unimog (64cm!).</li>
	<li>This means there are a lot of cross-axle tube connectors, this time 13! in dark grey instead of 2 in blue at the Unimog.</li>
</ul>

<p>Other parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Then there are 12 wheels. The first time LEGO makes a truck with a double rear axle with 4 tires each and double front axles. There was never a model with 12 of these wheels!</li>
	<li>There is a whole lot of light grey panels and shells. A pity LEGO did not introduce dark grey shells as it would have been a logic choice on the cabin.</li>
	<li>The new gear rack system: it is cool to see it double as an outrigger and as a crane extension. I think the rack is hard to use for other purposes, but the toothed bar looks very useful for other projects.</li>
	<li>A good selection of white panels and wings.</li>
	<li>A great set of suspension parts: 8 dampers, many H-bars, 2 differentials, 10 mini suspension arms</li>
	<li>A massive selection of basic parts, great to start a Technic collection</li>
</ul>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The build is awesome! Not much repetition, often a sense of &quot;what the heck is this going to be&quot;, I like the creative use of parts for other things. For example the steering mech is really wacko! The suspension on the back is also a great example of out-of-the-box use of parts. That makes creative! Nice!</p>

<p>For the building experience I always prefer one-motor-does all with a zillion gears than the no-gears many motors approach used for the Volvo loader last year. The mechanical aspect is very complex and makes the build process first class.</p>

<p>The crane is not at all hard to make. LEGO did a real great job with the colour-coded tube guides at the bottom, the tube-segments. The result is a really easy to fill shaft with tubes, that rotates very smooth. So far the &quot;hardest&quot; part is much easier than I thought it would be.</p>

<p>But then starts the frustration. Putting the crane ON the truck is awkward. The tubes pop out on the bottom, they touch underlaying gears, the frame with the pneumatic switches gets deformed when connecting it to the chassis&hellip;. Where the crane rotates very smooth as separate item, it often makes the white coupling gear slip when in place.</p>

<p>Another really hard thing is the mounting of the cabin. The instruction manual is very unclear on this. There are 4 red pins. The 2 that pop into the ends of the grey bars along the engine are straightforward, but the 2 on the black 5M arms have to be put in the middle of the 3 hole side of 2 dark grey 3x5 L shaped arms just behind the 2 red pins you mounted before.</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>The truck looks amazing. I really like the colour scheme. Black with accents is always good for me. To me the mud guards are OK, but the spacing between the front wheels feels a bit too long. No big deal. The cabin is amazingly detailed, with 4 mirrors including dead angle ones, nice doors that open, a very well done grill and nice use of little white wings as aerodynamic shields on the corners of the cabin. The battery box is nicely hidden in the cabin.</p>

<p>Playability is similar to the Unimog, which means most of the same errors are made:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you don&#39;t make reverse part of the gear box, then include a direction switch with the battery box. The battery box is a flawed design, and not suitable for changing directions. I wonder if it would be possible to do it with 4 handles instead of 2, and have all the handles except the pneumatic pump activator include 2 directions.</li>
	<li>The layout of the pneumatic switches is awkward. The big cylinders should be on one side, the extension and bucket on the other side. Now you make many operation errors. We found it easier to swap the tubes on the arm between the extension cylinder and the second big one. Then you can operate the bottom part on one side, and the scoop and extension on the other side.</li>
	<li>The crane arm is too heavy. I wonder if you can make it with half the parts. I would accept the crane to be more flimsy if the number of parts would have been reduced greatly. Only when the pressure is almost at the maximum, the crane will get up.</li>
	<li>The mini-pneumatic-cylinder for the scoop is not up to the job, just as with the Unimog gripper. A classic big one would have been better.</li>
	<li>Rotation of the crane is best decoupled from the gear-box by removing one gear, and make it operate by hand.</li>
	<li>You would expect the coupling gear to prevent ticking of the linear actuator that operates the bucket, but it does not.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note:</p>

<p>When you use the pneumatic switches with <em>smaller divergence</em>, it will be much easier to operate the crane. For example you can slowly lower the whole crane, where it usually drops down immediately when you switch the lever all the way. Another benefit is that the cylinder remains under pressure, and that it goes up directly after if you reverse the switch. With normal use the pump has to build up full pressure, and that takes 10-15 seconds or so before the arm goes up.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>The Mercedes Arocs is an amazing set. The greatest features are the awesome pneumatics part collection and the awesome building process. The new pneumatics make the range of the crane excellent for the first time. You can reach everywhere in the bucket and around the truck. The aspect ratio (width-length) of the cylinders is very nice, and give a very nice &quot;hydraulic&quot; look.<br />
I would recommend the truck to anyone who likes to start with Technic: <em>you get lots of everything at a sharp price</em>. The truck is 50&euro; cheaper than the 42030 Volvo wheel loader, yet way cooler with 1200 extra parts in a much greater variation of colour!</p>

<p><strong>An instant classic!</strong></p>

The other reviews cover the facts of this set very well, so I&#39;m setting this one out a little differently. This review is for those of you thinking <em>&quot;Is it really worth my money?&quot; </em>The answer, by the way, is a resounding <strong>Yes!</strong></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are plenty of surprises in this set. The new Linear booms are very solid and I can think of a tonne of uses for them, from fire ladders in lego city sets to extending space ship legs and plain old linear actuators for larger Technic MOC&#39;s. There&#39;s the pneumatics, which form a full fledged 4 way system, meaning you can build excavator arms, cranes, and all manner of other functional machines. There are plenty of gears and a multitude of lift arms and 12 wheels along with suspension parts. In short, this is a Lego technic collection in a single box. It&#39;s nice that other than the new booms, this model doesn&#39;t rely on a host of new or specialist parts. The Pneumatics are an evolution, and almost every other part is just innovative in its use.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is epic. Very memorable, and really exciting as the model comes together in big chunks. One tip is to build Stages 5 and 6 first, then 1-4 in order. In this manner, the set comes together very quickly at the end, with no &#39;boring&#39; cosmetic finishing sections. Once you&#39;re into the meat of the chassis build, the technical innovation never stops. I promise you you will say to yourself &#39;wow that&#39;s clever&#39; at least a dozen times. That&#39;s about once an hour. Perhaps more! The gearbox is not as complex as 42009&#39;s, but it&#39;s all the more impressive for being compact and containing both the pneumatic pump and stabiliser legs.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that everything works, which is impressive enough as it is. It&#39;s not that it looks good, which it really does. It&#39;s that everything works <em>well </em>and by aping real mechanical design principles too. The model sits so well as a whole and feels like a functional machine, not a toy or a display piece. The suspension is functional but firm enough to support the weight, which is substantial. it&#39;s my favorite part of this model because it&#39;s lifelike and really very innovative. The Arm moves realistically due to the pneumatic pump. I&#39;ve seen people complain about it dropping too suddenly - well, with some finesse on the switch you can bleed pressure gradually creating very precise and lifelike movement. My bucket grabber works well, so I&#39;d suggest particular attention to the bushings and working the piston prior to assembling it. It&#39;s just brilliant fun to look at, try out, play with and &#39;drive&#39; along the floor. My son, nearly 4, absolutely loves grabbing his duplo bricks with it. The Crane arm is free to rotate when not powered, making playing even more fun since there&#39;s no worry about breaking anything.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you are even half thinking about buying this set, just do it. You will NOT be disappointed. I had to wait 3 weeks to build it, and whilst it sat in the box I was worried that I&#39;d spent so much. As soon as that compelling build began, all doubts vanished. That so many parts, so much detail, and so many functions have been crammed into such a great looking set is frankly incredible. About half way through, I was convinced of it&#39;s value and it started to feel cheap for what it offered! This is the current pinnacle of Technic Lego, a statement of intent from The Lego Group and no doubt from Kossmann himself. It will take quite something to top this set in future. A well deserved 5 star Flagship set.</p>

"bratwojciech","2015-08-13T21:51:54.583Z","New Pneumatics old problems","<p>As there is a great detailed review I will do it quickly concentrating mainly on my thoughts and things that I have found&nbsp;during the build</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>There are some small errors in the instruction (e.g. Missing point 3 in one of the part builds etc). But in general instruction looks impressive&nbsp;- almost 500 pages !</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>New pneumatics but again the old problem was not solved. When moving pneumatics up everything looks great and works fine, but when the pistol is going down, the whole crane is smashing ground with huge speed and power, it just doesn&#39;t&nbsp;look right and it is almost impossible to play with it</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/a</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build is fantastic, great 12-15h&nbsp;of fun. I recommend to slowly build the crane part. It is pretty tough but it is worth to spend 3-4h just on that piece.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks fantastic, it is one of the most complex Lego sets ever designed (it might be quite difficult for average 10 year old kid - set is dedicated for kids&nbsp;10 to 16). The whole model is impressive, videos and pictures will not give you the impression comparing to the wow effect&nbsp;when it is ready. Model looks fantastic and very realistic.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great build, lots of parts. But it is really difficult to play with this set as steering of the pneumatic&nbsp;crane is really challanging and can make&nbsp;you&nbsp;frustrated after some time</p>

"Dude45","2016-09-07T13:21:42.57Z","A display piece lacking in playability","<p>This set has received a lot of praise. Indeed, it is an impressive model that works very well as a display piece. Anybody with the slightest interest in gadgets and cool technical stuff will be drawn to it like bees to honey. It certainly looks like the real deal, although the chassis section underneath the cab is a little too hollow for my liking.</p>

<p>The pneumatic functions, arguably&nbsp;the main feature of this set, are disappointing. Most of the time nothing happens when you use them, and you have to aid the robotic arm and spoon with your fingers before it gets into motion the way it&#39;s supposed to. Well, it may be down to my building skills, but I have heard friends echoing this comment and I consider myself&nbsp;a seasoned builder. I also found the instructions for the pneumatic arm so poorly written that I had to consult YouTube videos to fully understand how to put the tubes together. Really, this flaw must be the worst I&#39;ve ever encountered in a LEGO instruction.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, like many other modern Technic designs, the rigidity of this vehicle is too bad. It all comes down to the new studless Technic beams which are nowhere strong enough to hold this heavy thing together. Pick the model up by the middle and it feels curved as a banana. The flexibility in the chassis and body also makes the suspension (which is too hard, by the way) pretty much useless from a functional perspective. This was never a problem back in the days when studded beams were used.</p>

<p>The steering of the model is cool with two axle-trees, but the sheer weight of the model makes it too hard to actually move the wheels, which significantly reduces playability.</p>

<p>So there you have it: this is a model with impressive looks great for showcasing cool Technic features, but one that lacks quite a lot in playability.</p>

"madkins007","2017-09-17T21:17:46.863Z","B-Version Build, 42043 Arocs, semi flatbed with loader arm","<p>There have been a lot of positive reviews about the A-Version of the 42043 Arocs truck, but I have not seen a lot about the B-Version, a semi truck with a loading arm on the back of the flatbed. I was bored with my model so decided to give it a try.<br />
<br />
The first challenge was finding instructions. After a longish search, I finally found some that were clear and claimed to be &#39;corrected&#39;. One glitch to the directions I did find was a lack of how to work the various features- for example, the tilt bed is now a powered pair of parking legs and the grab bucket is a rotating pallet loader. Not a big deal but as far as I can find the instructions do not actually tell you how to attach the pallet to the loading head.</p>

<p>When I took apart my A-version to do this, I tried to take it apart by phases, the way it was built. This helped a lot with the rebuild but you should know up front that I kept having to dig into other bags to find parts. I should also admit that I was too lazy to bother do a lot more pre-sorting that that, and I also need to admit that I sorted my leftover parts from the A-Version into my collection and don&#39;t remember what they were.</p>

<p>Speaking of parts, I kept finding that I did not seem to have a few of the needed parts, either in the right color or at all. I was able to fill in most of the minor gaps from my collection, and work around another one. (I&#39;m sorry I did not keep a list of the parts I was short. I really had not planned on writing a review.)</p>

<p>As far as the actual build, it was fun, straightforward, and&nbsp;much simpler than the A-version- for example there is only one transmission at the rear of the tractor rather than the dual system on the original, only one steering axle, simplified suspension, and the grab bucket is replaced by a simpler rotating mechanism. The loading arm also seemed a lot easier this time around. I am not sure if it is because there is more space for it than in the A-Version, or because I knew what I was doing this time around.</p>

<p>There was the usual scattering of errors in the instructions, and some steps were complicated enough that it was not always clear what to do. On the other hand, there were no &#39;assembly line&#39; builds, and whenever I DID mess up, it was usually easy to go back and redo it.<br />
<br />
The build took about 5-6 hours and when it was all said and done, I have much longer than the original-&nbsp;truck that is fun to play with... even if it IS way to big to steer on my dining room table!</p>

"pinz","2018-01-07T23:58:18.15Z","For sure one of the best technic sets in past","<p>The Arocs!</p>

<p>approx 4.5 kg of Lego bricks :-) The instructions are 800+ pages and 2.8k bricks want to be in the correct place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building it was quite fun, the 6-cyclinder&nbsp;enginge (straight in a row) the gear-boxes for the deferential&nbsp;and the 4 wheel steering. Nice and straight foreward, the only tricky part is the big gearbox under he pneumatic powered arm. You turn it around quite often and it is easy to miss it once. So I ended up with 3 gears not build in, first I thought, a few spares, nice.</p>

<p>But after I finished all moving parts inserted the still clunky battery-box (hello Lego? any cool new stuff build on some more environment friendly rechargeable technology in the works?) I saw that there are no spares for the gears. Well you should not build late in the night, I got it :-)</p>

<p>I undid a few bricks after I was finish with the whole model and rebuild the gearbox from scratch. That took about 30 minutes.</p>

<p>The rest is fun to build, the nice details like the grill in front of the drivers-cabin (that you can move up and tilt, to see the engine working) the printed Mercedes-logo on the brick in front of the grill. Only one thing, that is probably not only annoying me, you get a lot of stickers.</p>

<p>The arm with all the flexible pneumatic-pipes is sometimes a bit tricky&nbsp;to build and to follow in the instructions, especially&nbsp;since the pipes are not exactly the sice as written, so measure them and decide what is closet to instruction. and in the base-gear you have to squece a lot of plumbing thru, so take your time there and see how it fits best.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The functions are mostly powered by one engine, the turning of the arm is sometimes a bit too fast for my taste, but it has only one speed, so... the pneumatic has come a long way, but I guess a airtank would be a cool feature in the future, this little pump is combined with the motor makes quite a noise. But overall the legs to stabilize are powered by the motor as well as the linear-motor&nbsp;for the fright-compartment.</p>

<p>Manual powred are the stamps at the stabiliser legs, the steering, the locking mechanism of the compartment (that by the way is very nice to build), and the doors as well as the cabin.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it is a big model, fun to play with, nice to build and a lot of details and functions. I guess it will be a shiny star in every Lego-collection.</p>

"Elv1s","2018-08-02T03:49:35.68Z","I spent 2 hours playing with this...","<p>I spent 2 hours playing with a set, normally, I just build a set, see what is can do, then put on my shelf for display. I DEFINITELY&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this set.</p>

<h2>Building Exp.</h2>

<p>There is&nbsp;a great usage of parts to create angles that aren&#39;t normally used in technic sets. The pneumatics are a brand new way of saying,&quot;Hey, look what LEGO can do!&quot; However, the best part of this set is how complex the steering system is, it is nothing like the every-day LEGO steering.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>There are a&nbsp;reasonable&nbsp;amount of stickers, which is good, but the parts are where it&#39;s at. This set has a new type of bucket, pneumatic lift arms, and a few&nbsp;of other parts. This set even has a exclusive printed Mercedes-Benz piece.</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>This set has around&nbsp;13 different functions which work well when playing with the set, everything responds correctly. Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s pretty&nbsp;robust, so that when kids kick it, ram it, but don&#39;t go ahead and throw it or step on it,&nbsp;that&#39;s just really stupid.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>

<p>What I consider good pricing is 10 cents price for part ratio, but this set does even better with only 8 cents p/p plus all the&nbsp;cool parts. Overall, I say this is great.</p>

<h2>Cautions</h2>

<p>Cats really like to chew on the tubes, so&nbsp;keep this set on a high shelf where you know your cat won&#39;t get to it. Letting your feline consume&nbsp;a tube may lead to choking&nbsp;or the demise of the feline.</p>
