<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Fantastic! These small sets come jam-packed with detailed and useful little pieces. I regret not buying more just for the variety contained within. Highlights are the artist&#39;s palette, the chicken (my first), printed clock and the wall elements.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The mum is nice enough, but the kid is the stand-out. A fantastic T-shirt design combined with *that* panicking face is just perfect!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple as you&#39;d expect.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>So much detail! I love this and set 40120, and combined with my MOCs inspired by them, they look great all together.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For the price you really, really can&#39;t go wrong. I regret not buying more, as the piece selection is great, it comes with 2 decent minifigures, and well, eggs. If you find these, snap them up!</p>
