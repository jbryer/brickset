I&rsquo;m going to do my best to review it early this time and ensure that everything is top notch. Enjoy the brand new Advent Calendar from LEGO Friends, I&rsquo;m thinking this year I may even be able to get a LEGO City or Star Wars Calendar to compare it to. Though no promises.</p>

<p>Box</p>

<p>The box once again does not disappoint. This time we see a nice little scene outside in the city square, with Santa flying across the moon and a nice festive design. We also see the two mini-dolls in the set and some of the gifts. The back of the box also spoils some of the contents and which door their behind, they also show a lot of different fun scenarios for playing with the models found in this calendar.</p>

<p>Inside this time we have a festive scene, the city square is again the central point of the image, with a nice ice rink on the open flap, we saw a similar rink in 2013 with the LEGO Friends Advent Calendar, that time it was for ice skating, this time it seems more for playing ice hockey. Overall I&rsquo;d have to say that this box is definitely fun and cute looking, what you come to expect from LEGO Friends Advent Calendars.</p>

<p>Advent Models</p>

<p>Day 1: Andrea:</p>

<p>Each year we&rsquo;ve gotten one of the main Friends Mini-Dolls in a festive costume for the holidays. In 2012 it was Olivia, a very elusive Advent Calendar for whatever reason, in 2013 there was Stephanie and last year we had Mia. All that remains is for 2016 to give us Holiday Emma.</p>

<p>Andrea is a great mini-doll to find on day one, her print involves a nice dark blue and white sweater with a chest pattern that may or may not be snowman themed. They don&rsquo;t exactly look like snowmen, but at that size it could be tricky to make a clear image of a snowman. Her lower torso is a red skirt with dark grey leggings and red boots with white trim. Overall definitely festive and really fun looking.</p>

<p>Day 2: Ice Skate Stand:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing here, but I believe this is meant to be a small stand to hold ice skates before putting them on. It&rsquo;s a very simple microbuild with four pieces, this includes a small 1x2 sculpted brick, which is always nice to see. The skates sit on top of a small teal plate, in the snow is a small red flower piece underneath the shelf, probably not a real flower, but a fake decoration piece.</p>

<p>I like this door, it&rsquo;s a useful microbuild and it includes three skates, if you&rsquo;ve been collecting Advent Calendars you&rsquo;ll have almost enough skates for all the mini-dolls. If you have a few extra holiday themed sets that include the figure skate piece you&rsquo;re always left with one extra, so I&rsquo;m certain you&rsquo;ll have enough skates for everybody. In keeping with the creative side of these toys this adds some playability, Andrea can now &lsquo;skate&rsquo; on the ice rink on the bottom flap of the calendar box.</p>

<p>Day 3: Sled:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sad to say that if you looked at the back of the box you&rsquo;re going to be spoiled as to what&rsquo;s behind door #3. This little sled is shown coming out of the window on the back image.</p>

<p>However this is a really fun little model to build, it&rsquo;s quite clever too. Last year&rsquo;s calendar gave us a sled using bricks, this time we get some plates and a pair of black pieces that look like sled runners, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure where they originate from. It&rsquo;s a very cute little sled and fun to build and fun to play with, it has 8 pieces two of them are pink and one is lavender. Great little model.</p>

<p>Day 4: Snowman:</p>

<p>Today is a cute little snowman build, you get 10 pieces here plus three spares, the build is very simple, but quite fun and it&rsquo;s always nice to get a plain white mini-figure head when you want to MOC something, or make a bunch of Snowmen. Instead of coal on his chest, Andrea seems to have used a pink fake flower for his belly button, very stylish. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with this type of mini-model, it&rsquo;s always nice to see different takes on Snowmen builds and this one has a decent design. With a dome for the lower body and one of those studs on four sides and on-top bricks for the torso, more brown carrot tops for the stick arms and a nice black top hat on the head. The Snowman is a winner, this year has started out quite strong.</p>

<p>Day 5: Liza:</p>

<p>Another day, another mini-doll. Again I find that it seems a bit early for this one, if they had more than two mini-dolls in each calendar this would make more sense. It gives you the chance to have a friend for Andrea to play with, with the other models, and then you can keep having more friends join them if others were included.</p>

<p>Liza is another blonde haired, blue-eyed Mini-Doll, between her, Stephanie, Marie, Ewa, Naya and such I&rsquo;m surprised you can tell who is who. She&rsquo;s dressed in regular white riding pants, though probably not meant to be riding pants, and a white top with a print that looks more like an indoor outfit than a winter weather one. It kind of looks like a house coat or something you&rsquo;d wear while loafing around the house in front of a fireplace during the holidays.</p>

<p>Overall a nice mini-doll, great to have, just wish LEGO would include three at least so that there&rsquo;d be another one to look forward.</p>

<p>Day 6: Pair of Skies:</p>

<p>A pair of purple skies with a pink flag, possibly for slalom races. This isn&rsquo;t much, it&rsquo;s a very simple build, but it&rsquo;s fun to add it as a play feature for the mini-dolls in the set. You also have a pink helmet, I&rsquo;m still not a fan of the helmets with mini-dolls, I prefer the types of head gear that include hair to show that they at least still have some. The ski poles are teal and the flag is pink. A slightly weaker offering, however this is definitely a nice addition from the calendar.</p>

<p>Day 7: Outdoor Stage:</p>

<p>It was inevitable that this year would include a stage where Andrea could sing her heart out, since she loves to sing. This little outdoor stage has a microphone stand and a few cheese slopes to indicate that some snow is on the stage. It&rsquo;s a fun little build, fourteen pieces in the build, with mostly 1x4 plates, two of them are a light tan, the other four I&rsquo;m not sure what colour you&rsquo;d call them. They kind of look very light brown to me, it&rsquo;s a fairly rareish colour I believe.</p>

<p>Not much else to say, it offers up a nice build and great fun to play with Andrea and Liza.</p>

<p>Day 8: Speaker:</p>

<p>Last year we had a speaker which shares a very similar build to this one, however this one improves slightly on the speaker by including a unique way to have it rest at an angle, one of the clicking hinge joint pieces. This speaker goes with the outdoor stage from the previous day, so it&rsquo;s a very nice addition to flesh out the scene of Andrea enjoying time performing outdoors her favorite holiday classics. The speaker is such an easy build you could make more so there would be more to put around for an audience of Friends to hear Andrea singing.</p>

<p>Day 9: Saxophone &amp; Stand:</p>

<p>Keeping the theme of an impromptu Christmas Concert going we have a small four piece model, this is a small stand to clip the Saxophone accessory on. It&rsquo;s pretty uninspiring, however the inclusion of the rare saxophone piece bumps up the value of the contents of this door.</p>

<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t mind it so much if it at least had a better colour choice, you have a rose jumper plate with plain bley 1x1 brick and brick with clip topped by a pink flower stud. Yeah the colour choice just isn&rsquo;t festive enough, a rich dark green pair of bricks would have made this look much better.</p>

<p>Day 10: Accessories:</p>

<p>UGH, of course, every year they include these pieces and every year I&rsquo;ll say the same thing, why waste a door with such an uninspiring decision? They don&rsquo;t even make them in red and green Christmas themed colours, you just get the exact same teal or purple colours. And if you&rsquo;ve collected Friends sets since the beginning you&rsquo;ll have loads of these.</p>

<p>Now bear in mind if this is your first time getting them they are a welcome inclusion, you have bows, sunglasses, hairbrushes and a hand held mirror for the mini-dolls to play with, so if this is your first time opening an advent calendar and want some of these for your new mini-dolls to play with than it is nice to see them. However I just don&rsquo;t think they should be by themselves. It is much nicer if you included at least something to build, a small vanity or something in the same door, because just opening a door to find these things and nothing else to build can be very disappointing.</p>

<p>Also I don&rsquo;t particularly care for having a ton of these things which can be easily lost without anything to put them in, a box or something out of plates and stuff to prevent you from accidentally misplacing the pieces.</p>

<p>Day 11: Box?</p>

<p>Ah, here&rsquo;s what I was talking about. Behind door 11 we have a small open box to hold accessories, and a crown, fairy want in pink and elf hat. This is much more festive, and while you might be wondering what for, the answer is obvious. Here you have some accessories for Liza and Andrea to put on a small pageant. A sugar plumb fairy with the gold crown and wand and an elf. Although this is just the green hat from the Lawn Gnome. So again I do wish they&rsquo;d made a new sculpted piece specifically for the mini-dolls so their hair could still be seen underneath the cap.</p>

<p>You also have two crowns and two wands, spares in case you misplace them or just for two sugar plumb fairies.</p>

<p>Day 12: Baby Bunny Hutch:</p>

<p>This is a nice looking model. Not only do you get the rare baby bunny piece, but you have a nice little house for it to live in that you get to build. It&rsquo;s a very nice looking build, on top of that I&rsquo;m glad to see the carrot included for the baby to nibble on. I&rsquo;m glad to see this here and I have to say so far, at the halfway point this calendar hasn&rsquo;t disappointed nearly as much as it could have. Only Day 10 was a real disappointment, if only because the accessories are just everywhere in LEGO Friends, and maybe a new set of Christmas Themed accessories would make a better choice, even if you can only use them once a year.</p>

<p>Day 13: Food Stand:</p>

<p>I think this is some sort of dessert selling stand at the local ice rink, you have a fair number of pieces here and three of the sculpted brick pieces. You also get a standard green plant piece with two red flowers to make the holiday plant decoration. This is a solid mini-model, and includes a 100 dollar bill, which I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve seen before in an advent calendar. A solid model, am I repeating myself? Yeah, but really this one stands out so far as the most pieces and the most building from this year&rsquo;s calendar.</p>

<p>Day 14: Outdoor Oven:</p>

<p>Baking treats to sell is what the Friends of Heartlake City enjoy. Baking the treats to be sold at yesterday&rsquo;s stand seems to be a must, and while there isn&rsquo;t much different from the build of this model from similar ovens in other sets, it&rsquo;s a nice addition to the model from yesterday, the tray holds one treat, but there are spare parts so you can make two treats instead of one. I think they&rsquo;re frosted cookies or cupcakes. Decent model.</p>

<p>Day 15: Cooking Accessories:</p>

<p>Even more goodies to bake, or make, not sure. You get a pot, two clear pink glasses and I believe a blender using a clear mug and brown mini-figure head. There&rsquo;s also some more icing covered treats. It&rsquo;s a weaker bit of stuff being offered today, but they go nicely with yesterday&rsquo;s oven and the mini-dolls can drink some hot cocoa.</p>

<p>Day 16: Cake and Lolly:</p>

<p>Today you get a small table with some more baked treats, it would appear that this year the Friends are enjoying holiday baking quite often. The small table is a nice three piece model with two purple 1x2 bricks and a 1x3 tan plate. The cake is a nice layer with a chocolate bottom, a pink inner layer, more chocolate and a white round jumper plate, which I think is a new piece, or I haven&rsquo;t seen it before, plus an icing flower.</p>

<p>The lollypop uses the air traffic directing piece and a printed stud with swirl pattern. It isn&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s pretty big. Not the best, but still a serviceable offering from today.</p>

<p>Day 17: Benches:</p>

<p>Not much to say about today, it&rsquo;s a pair of teal benches and a small candle or fire pit thing for roasting marshmallows. It isn&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s nice for Andrea and Liza to relax after all that baking and outdoor sports, and of course the concert Andrea put on with her friend.</p>

<p>Day 18: Table:</p>

<p>This is a bit odd, and also slightly limited in piece count compared to last year&rsquo;s table. I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s a table to go with the benches and the candle, perhaps they are at an outdoor camp site to have a holiday picnic. That&rsquo;s not a bad idea, and it does add to yesterday&rsquo;s model if that&rsquo;s the case, it gives you somewhere to put that candle instead of having it on the ground.</p>

<p>Day 19: Hockey Accessories and Stand:</p>

<p>This is a thrilling day for me, and probably for a lot of people. Hockey Sticks from LEGO are hard to find, and here you get two for each of the Mini-Dolls to use for a friendly game of 1-on-1. The stand has a nice simple, clever little design, it holds the hockey sticks in place when not being used as well as the puck. It&rsquo;s great to finally get to build this, one of the better offerings from this calendar.</p>

<p>Day 20: Hockey Goals:</p>

<p>A nice pair of goals for the Mini-Dolls to use for playing that game, they use all yellow pieces with two 1x2 grey plates and a pink flower on top. A simple build, but compliments the hockey accessories nicely and must have for playing a game of hockey.</p>

<p>Day 21: Snowball Launcher:</p>

<p>I believe this is part of a two day build for an outdoor winter game to play. This is a simple snowball launcher, with your standard LEGO catapult build. It would have been nice to see the small catapult piece in a new colour, but here it&rsquo;s just the standard dark brown found in many Castle sets. Not as exciting yet, but once you get the other half of the game you will see a bit of an improvement over this.</p>

<p>Day 22: Knock-It Over Game:</p>

<p>This is your standard hit the cans or bottles with something and knock it over to win a prize game. It&rsquo;s a simple build, quick and goes with yesterday&rsquo;s snowball launcher. The point of the game is to knock over all three cans and win a prize. Alone it isn&rsquo;t much, but combined with the snowball launcher it&rsquo;s a fun activity for the Friends to play in.</p>

<p>Day 23: Christmas Tree:</p>

<p>Is there a reason why LEGO seems to like making the tree not what you get on Christmas Eve? It happened last year and it happened this year too. It&rsquo;s a pleasant little build though, you get some white branches instead of just all green, so it must be covered in fake snow or something. The star on top uses the star shaped cookie/stud piece, which is a bit odd of a choice for the design. Since it lies down you don&rsquo;t actually see the star, if you had an extra piece so it could be a proper topper for the tree it might work better.</p>

<p>Interesting that this year there are no presents at all to fit under the tree.</p>

<p>Day 24: Penguin:</p>

<p>Well it&rsquo;s been another 24 days and another helping of interesting models and accessories, it&rsquo;s nice to see them bring the penguin back, but I don&rsquo;t feel it should have been on Christmas Eve. LEGO is really terrible at choosing where to put what, honestly I would have preferred to see them ditch the accessories from day 10 and have the penguin there so that we could have some brick built Christmas decoration here, like a reindeer or something.</p>

<p>Anyway let&rsquo;s discuss this properly. The penguin includes a light purple/lavender bow, and again I&rsquo;m not a fan of the oversized accessories. The penguin gets to sit on a tiny iceberg. It&rsquo;s pretty cute, and it&rsquo;s nice to include another animal for your LEGO Friends collection, however it&rsquo;s an odd choice for Christmas Eve.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say that this year was a fairly solid collection of models, accessories and mini-dolls. It was definitely much more impressive than my first offering back in 2013, and is on par with the level of quality I&rsquo;ve come to expect since 2014. I still think LEGO could use some more thought in some of the design choices and some of the contents, there are still some days where you get very little in the form of pieces or building. And enough with the accessories, seriously they are in quite a few LEGO Friends sets and they don&rsquo;t do much here, I would much prefer to see some new holiday based accessories, a few holly and ivy berets, some earmuffs to fit over the hair pieces, bows in red and green for the holidays instead of just teal, purple or pink and something other than hair brushes. I&rsquo;m not sure what yet, but I&rsquo;m sure it would be a huge improvement.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend this though, because it&rsquo;s still a thrill to see what there is day-by-day, just remember that this review is a bit of a spoiler. So if you don&rsquo;t want to know what&rsquo;s behind each door and would prefer a surprise, then let your parents read this first and wait until December to see what you&rsquo;re going to get.</p>
