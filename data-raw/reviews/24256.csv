<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Scooby Doo branding is definitely eye catching, LEGO have chosen a lime green background, with purple used for the logo amd inset images. I&#39;m not sure why the green was chosen, but it does work well for the theme.</p>

<p>The rear of the box shows all the play features, but also has a graphic showing all &nbsp;of the theme&#39;s minifigures in a classic Scooby Doo chase scene which instantly gave me a wave of nostalgia and made me smile.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The majority of parts in the set are fairy standard, lots of grey and tan, but they are very useful pieces. This set could be used as a parts pack for any historic theme, but could also work for space builders or certain Star Wars scenes.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are always a big draw for licenced themes, and the greatest surprise with this line is that the monsters have reverse printing on the heads to allow for the iconic unmasking scenes. Included in this set are three minifigures;</p>

<p>Scooby Doo - this seems to be the most basic version of Scooby, in a standing position with a plain expression on his face. He comes in two pieces with the head as a separate&nbsp;part to the body. I was a little disappointed that the head isn&#39;t compatible with a standard minifigure body, but it is compatible with some other LEGO parts.</p>

<p>Shaggy - I wasn&#39;t completely sure about the design until I had it in hand, but now I own it, this is a great minifigure. First, it&#39;s great to see the two colour arms being made with fleshies in mind. The two face prints capture Shaggy&#39;s character really well, one side showing a nervous smile, and the other a scared expression. I particularly like that they included his stubbly goatee. The best feature of the minifigure though is the new hair piece, while its very obviously Shaggy it could easily be used in other themes.</p>

<p>The Mummy - At first glance this is the weakest of the figures, mainly because it looks like a lot of other very generic mummy minifigures, the pharaoh&nbsp;headpiece is the only thing that significantly sets it apart from the Monster Fighters or collectable minifigures mummy. That is until you look at the rear head print&nbsp;and see the classic Scooby Doo villain unmasked expression. Just seeing that brought the &quot;I would have gotten away with it too, if it weren&#39;t for you meddling kids,&quot; line to mind.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Most of the build is pretty straight forward, conisting mainly of standard stacking, and very little in the way of studs not on top pieces. For it&#39;s size though this isn&#39;t an issue, if the build was a lot bigger it might feel boring, but for a small set it&#39;s quite satisfying.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model, while not being incredibly eye catching, does exactly what it needs. It looks convincingly like part of a museum exhibit and has great pay features. The burger hanging fom the back of the model does seem a little odd, but connects to classic Scooby Doo storylines, where Shaggy and Scooby might accidentally apprehend&nbsp;a villain while searching food.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Definitely&nbsp;a strong start to the theme, while I&nbsp;would have preferred a continuation of the Monster Fighters theme, this is a good substitute to keep me happy and definitely shows great promise for a long running theme.</p>

It's the Mummy!","<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Set #75900 Mummy Museum Mystery:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> Howdy folks, let&rsquo;s get started in reviewing the sets from LEGO Scooby-Doo, a Theme that has been a long time coming, and a cherished childhood memory for many. So far we&rsquo;ve only received six sets for this Theme and that was back during October of 2015, a shame there aren&rsquo;t any new sets for this Halloween, but perhaps LEGO will surprise us this time next year with more sets for the Theme to celebrate a new batch of Spooky Mysteries and Halloween Fun.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box/Instructions</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: Even a small box such as this set really captures the look and feel of the classic cartoon. It also shows the set off on the back quite nicely. Due to its size there isn&rsquo;t much more to discuss, however I will take this moment to note that each set says to get the app, if you&rsquo;re a smart phone owner they really are trying to sell this gimmick.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: The manual is a really fun one with a great look to it. It has easy to follow build steps and some great cross-promotional images in the back for the Scan Game element with these sets, which I know precious little about, and a group shot of every set in the Theme. It&rsquo;s also got your standard easy to follow LEGO build instructions with very little to trip anybody up. In a set of this size that is to be expected.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

It&rsquo;s nice to see it brought back as part of this small set, you&rsquo;ll also find a few matching coloured 6075079 pieces, I want to say they&rsquo;re officially called parapet pieces, but I&rsquo;m not entirely sure on that. Either way they are a nice golden shade that matches the lid of the sarcophagus.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Mummy: The print on this Minifigure is pretty similar to past mummies we&rsquo;ve seen in other Themes like CMF or Monster Fighters. There isn&rsquo;t any arm printing on this mummy and his face is different from past mummies of course, he looks suitably terrifying and a menace for Scooby and Shaggy, but once they manage to catch him and unmask him the back of the head reveals Dr. Najib, perhaps the curator of this museum who has become greedy and wants the jewels for himself.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Scooby-Doo: Using two pieces, Scooby has a sculpted head separate from his body, this version is standing on three paws with one slightly raised as though he&rsquo;s prepared to take a step. His facial expression is calm and somewhat neutral, the design allows you to swap heads so you can give him is scared expression from the other sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Shaggy: Shaggy looks great, he captures the look of the cartoon character perfectly, with his double-sided shirt print on his torso and a double-sided face with a terrified expression on one side and a happy one on the other. He&rsquo;s holding a printed tile with a &lsquo;clue&rsquo; on it, these are meant to be scanned by the app to unlock the secrets behind the mystery if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. Shaggy&rsquo;s hair piece is great looking too, I hope LEGO finds another use for it and gives it to us in new and unique colours because it&rsquo;s a great new style for future Minifigures to sport.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As far as builds go this is fairly standard for a set of this size and price range. You&rsquo;re asked to build a small scene from the Museum, specifically the Mummy display found in the Egyptian Wing, it isn&rsquo;t much to discuss really, there are no difficult steps, even as you build in the play features. I would caution however that it should be built on a flat surface as the model is like many of its ilk, if built on a soft surface or just in your hands it could easily fall apart due to the nature of the structure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Mummy Display: Quite frankly there is really very little to discuss with this model. It is a really neat model showcasing a mummy sarcophagus as seen in a museum, one each side of the sarcophagus are two pillars with stickers applied, one shows hieroglyphics detailing some kind of jewel and the other is a picture of Johnny Thunder from 1922 when the jewel was discovered.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The very short staircase leading up to the sarcophagus is hinged, it can swing open and underneath are some stolen goods, jewels it would seem that someone has hidden to pilfer with them. Behind the display is a vegetarian sandwich build attached to a short chain, a lure for Shaggy and Scooby perhaps? If they pull on it they open the mummy case and allow the costumed thief to leap out and terrify them.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is the smallest set in the Theme and doesn&rsquo;t include anyone truly unique aside from the Mummy, the model is really nice because of the detailing on the stickers and the sarcophagus lid. This means that, personally I&rsquo;d say this set is safe to skip. The Mystery Machine and other larger sets are definitely worth picking up, this one is only worth picking up if you want all six sets from this Theme and all of the masked criminals in Minifigure form.</span></span></span></span></p>
