I hope it will help make an informed decision when purchasing the set, now on to the points.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box/Instructions</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: With this theme you&rsquo;re really getting some fun box designs. Covered in green cartoon colours with spooky imagery and a great image showcasing the set you&rsquo;ll find this design is reminiscent of something else. Scooby Snaks. That&rsquo;s right LEGO has brought to life the animated design of Scooby&rsquo;s common treats.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The fun eye catching nature of the design is carried over onto the back and you&rsquo;ll find a fun little comical image of the costumed spectres chasing the Mystery Inc. gang in the lower corner of the box.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: I&rsquo;m a huge fan of the design for these instructions, sure they are standard LEGO instruction manuals, but they are all printed on Mystery Machine green pages which just looks fun and nostalgic for this old AFOL. It&rsquo;s also interesting to see that LEGO has included cross-promotional images for LEGO DC Super Heroes, as Scooby-Doo has teamed up with the Caped Crusader and the Boy Wonder in the past, it&rsquo;s a clever bit of cross-promotional fun.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There is also a sticker sheet with this set, as with most Scooby-Doo sets for the printed detailing used on the vehicles and such.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Like with all Scooby sets this particular one includes a lot of lime green and light teal coloured pieces due to the nature of the Mystery Incorporated colour scheme on their vehicles. I definitely think these are great parts packs because of this as those particular colours are quite rare outside of certain sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

The head print includes goggles over his eyes, something pilots wear customarily.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Shaggy: Being a standard print, Shaggy doesn&rsquo;t look any different in this set compared to the others. He shows up in this exact outfit in no less than six sets, counting the LEGO Dimensions Team Pack, this time his printed tile details a stolen trophy caper, it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;clue&rsquo; to help unmask the creepy kook.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Headless Horseman: This particular villain is well known, he plagued Ichabod Crane in the story of Sleepy Hollow and now he&rsquo;s back to threaten Shaggy and Scooby, complete with a white stallion, a sword and the stolen trophy in hand represented by a golden goblet. His torso is double-sided and features a print with a purple clasp around his neck for the cape, which is the older style of cape and not the softer material design introduced with LEGO DC Super Heroes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There&rsquo;s no printing on his legs, or the &lsquo;back&rsquo; side of his all black head, so that his new pumpkin head piece can look like a proper jack-o-lantern with nothing inside of it. But&hellip; When Scooby and Shaggy finally catch the Headless Horseman and unmask him, the proper side of his head with facial printing reveals Elwood Crane, the crook behind the theft of the golden trophy, and perhaps a distant relative of Ichabod who&rsquo;s decided to use the old legend to his advantage.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: With this bag you get to build the main body of the Mystery Plane, Scooby and the Headless Horseman Minifigures. The build is standard fair, with very easy to follow step-by-step instructions and surprisingly satisfying. The only step that may cause issues is the &lsquo;apply the stickers here&rsquo; step, because as is typical you are tasked with applying stickers to relatively small pieces, younger builders may need a little assistance in that moment.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: You finish the build of the plane with the wings here as well as Shaggy, and the long chain which features the play element for the set. This portion of the build can get mildly repetitive, it is also important to note that more stickers are used for detailing, I also feel it important to state that you should be ready to apply certain parts firmly. Especially when building up the wings, because I have noticed that some of that area of the build does have issues of lifting up if not firmly pressed down enough to ensure maximum clutch power.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Mystery Plane: It&rsquo;s a Green and Blue Bi-Plane with psychedelic looking paint job. Scooby and the gang haven&rsquo;t owned one of these before, but they have flown Bi-Planes before, so it&rsquo;s not much of a stretch that they&rsquo;d add a vehicle like this to their motor pool.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is a fun and very impressive model, I like everything about it, with exception to the looseness of the upper wings, a few more connector points might have been a welcome improvement to avoid the wings lifting up too easily. This could be a sign of parts having QC issues though, as I have noticed that sometimes clutch power isn&rsquo;t as good as it could have been. Though once pressed firmly together they will stay together indefinitely and stop lifting up.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Play features include two Scooby-Snack bombs that can be dropped from either side of the plane onto the spooky creep in the mask and a long chain dangling off one side, this is meant to be used for when Shaggy clumsily falls out of the plane and swings in to help catch the ghost, having Scooby pilot this plane isn&rsquo;t exactly the best idea.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is another set that I feel might be easily skipped if you&rsquo;re only interested in getting the main Mystery Inc. group, however I feel it would be a bit of a disservice to say that. We don&rsquo;t get many bi-plane models and despite being in an unconventional colour scheme, the Mystery Plane is a very nice, solid build that looks great. And the Headless Horseman is a great villain with a great looking design for a Minifigure, so I&rsquo;d strongly recommend this set for those reasons alone.</span></span></span></span></p>
