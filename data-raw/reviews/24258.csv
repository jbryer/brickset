"no_skill","2015-09-06T21:52:07.343Z","Really Great!","<p>I am an AFOL, but for the most part have stepped back into my dark ages over the last 5 years (kids growing up and&nbsp;too many competing&nbsp;interests!) EXCEPT for the &nbsp;rare&nbsp;must-have item. When I saw this set, it was truly &quot;must have.&quot; &nbsp;I&#39;m glad I got it!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box &nbsp;and instructions are both fine. Nothing special here. Like with most modern sets, the instructions are a little bit overly simplistic. This is a far cry from the &quot;figure it out yourself&quot; instructions from when I was a kid. &nbsp;I liked the old kind&nbsp;better, even when I was 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The 8-wide &nbsp;windshield is great. It&#39;s probably used in other sets, but it&#39;s a first for me. Other than that, no real surprises until you account for&nbsp;&nbsp;the awesome juxtaposition of&nbsp;blue and green&nbsp;colors.&nbsp; They&#39;re a&nbsp;perfect match for the Mystery Machine!&nbsp; &nbsp;The van&#39;s hubcaps &nbsp;and front dish are printed. Everything else is a sticker. &nbsp; Not ideal, but it keeps the colors true and I&#39;m sure prevents this from being a much more expensive set. &nbsp; It also has two black lightsaber&nbsp;handles (for flashlights), a minifig&nbsp;camera, and a minifig magnifying glass. &nbsp;Carrot stems hold the foliage on Mr. Zombie&#39;s tree; I like that.</p>

<p>To be completely critical, i&#39;m afraid I have to say that the decal printing was a little off &nbsp;for one of the sides of the van. &nbsp;Put together, I&nbsp;don&#39;t think it&#39;s all that&nbsp;noticeable unless you&#39;re looking/obsessing very closely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Fred, Shaggy, and Scooby are all done really, really well. The hair for Fred and Shaggy is spot-on; both have a modest amount of back detailing &nbsp;and reversible heads.&nbsp;Shaggy has short sleeves. &nbsp; The zombie torso is great and will work with tons of applications. I love the zombie&#39;s&nbsp;untucked shirt in olive&nbsp;green--soooo many applications for this torso!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Overall, a fun build (except for the stickers-what did you expect!).&nbsp; It&#39;s not technical, but it moves along at a good pace that I found very enjoyable. &nbsp;The&nbsp;lower half of the van is&nbsp;essentially SNOT for all visible surfaces. &nbsp;There is tongue-and-cheek humor built-in; there&#39;s a stove (and sink) in the van along with a huge Shaggy sandwich.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Absolutely perfect! The model truly looks like the Mystery&nbsp;Machine as I remember it from &nbsp;more than 40&nbsp;&nbsp;years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;There is instant playability as well. We get&nbsp;heroes, villains, jesters, and&nbsp;the kinetic&nbsp;awesomeness of a 1960&#39;s hippie van....all in one $30 set! &nbsp;I really can&#39;t imagine them doing a more&nbsp;accurate rendition, especially at this price point.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Speaking of the price point, I think that&#39;s great too! &nbsp;$30 &nbsp;for a&nbsp;licensed&nbsp;set &nbsp;with this much nostalgia, &nbsp;this much play potential, and such great minifugures&nbsp;is the&nbsp;closest you&#39;re going to come to a steal at retail value. I mean, seriously, &nbsp;how can you look at this set&nbsp;and not smile? I mean, the thing just exudes fun! It just exudes cool!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Must-have set of the year---and it&#39;s only 30 bucks!</p>

"Dragon_Master_48","2015-12-26T01:38:22.44Z","Simple But Exquisite","<p><strong>75902 The Mystery Machine</strong>&nbsp;is, for many people, a dream set. Finally, we get a LEGO Scooby-Doo theme, and a quality one at that!&nbsp;I must say, I definitely am not disappointed by what this set- and the theme as a whole- does.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re expecting a complex build, you&#39;re not going to get that from this set; however, that&#39;s not a bad thing at all. It&#39;s perfectly entertaining for younger, less experienced builders and those looking for something relaxing. The abundance of stickers, however, might dampen your mood if you&#39;re not a fan of them- nonetheless, with the exception of replacing them with printed pieces, nothing else can come close to matching the iconic look of the Mystery Machine, which, to be fair, the stickers accomplish quite well. Even then, there are a few printed pieces included, which is a nice plus.</p>

<p>The parts in this set are quite varied in color, and this provides an interesting mix of fascinating pieces for MOCers. The minifigures and accessories included in this set are also wonderful and reflect the nature of the source material well (especially, for the minifigures, the Zombie, and for the accessories, the camera and magnifying glass).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Nice depiction of the Mystery Machine for its size: just enough room for two figures in the front, Scooby in the back, and all the accessories.</li>
	<li>Excellent minifigures&nbsp;and pieces&nbsp;all around.</li>
	<li>Good play features and versatility, though not too many to lose track of.</li>
	<li>The little tree is a funny&nbsp;extra.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Stickers! So many stickers...</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on my experience with&nbsp;this model alone, I&#39;m hopeful for what this theme might hold in future years.&nbsp;The completed model is more than satisfactory. There&#39;s not too much in the set to the point where the complexity of either model is sacrificed, yet not too little to the point that the set as a whole is boring. Overall, this is a excellent model for anybody, and a great starting point for the rest of the theme... maybe the perfect complement to 75904...?</p>

"AETerry","2022-05-17T23:43:51.03Z","Mystery Machine","<p>Such a fun theme! This is easily one of the best sets from this series and an absolute must-have as the Scooby gang travels from one local to another on their mystery capers and adventures.</p>

<p>You get four minifigures with this set. The &quot;standard&quot; Shaggy and Scooby who appear in every set. Fred, who only appears and comes in this set and a zombie. Overall, this is a good assortment of figures.</p>

<p>The main build is, of course, The Mystery Machine Van with room for a driver and passenger, and when Daphne and Velma are gotten from other sets, room for them to sit in the back.<br />
<br />
A secondary, smaller build is that of a spooky, animated tree.</p>

<p>There&#39;s plenty here for many children to have a scene and mystery to solve. Older collectors have a fantastic build design with the Mystery Machine to set out for display.</p>

This build is done in roughly 44 pages and is relatively easy to follow along with. The biggest point of trouble younger builders may ask assistance for is the placement of the numerous stickers on the parts for the detailing that runs along the sides of the Mystery Machines. The bulk of which is created with applying stickers rather than printing the elements. And these parts are smooth sloped pieces predominantly.</span></span></span></span></p>

All of this is very quick and easy to build and again I say the only truly tricky part is the placement of the sticker for the monster tree&rsquo;s face. This one might require deft finger work and stuff. Once it&rsquo;s all finished though it&rsquo;s time to play and explore with Scooby and the gang.</span></span></span></span></p>

You can&rsquo;t fit the entire Mystery Inc. gang inside. There&rsquo;s enough space to fit two figures in the front and Scooby can go in the back on a series of jumpers. If you don&rsquo;t put Scooby in then you might get two Minifigures inside in his place, by then there&rsquo;s no room for Scooby. It is an unfortunate issue, but all of the Minifigures in this set can fit inside the vehicle, so at least there&rsquo;s that. I&rsquo;m sure with enough messing around you might find a way to get everybody in, however since the other sets include vehicles of their own you could always have Velma and Daphne drive their own rides to the Mystery.</span></span></span></span></p>

"8BrickMario","2016-01-19T18:44:21.74Z","It's no mystery that this set is a winner!","<p>This is probably the one set every Scooby-Doo fan will buy from the theme due to its iconic status. Is it represented well?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The boxes for the Scooby-Doo line are great, with a bright yellow-green background with a wavy border and a ghost around the Scooby-Doo logo, and the contrasting spooky background where the set is shown.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are pretty nice, as there&#39;s a lot of lime green and medium azure, as well as some orange. The windshield is a new piece, too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Shaggy and Scooby are the main characters of the show, so they&#39;ve been included in every set. Shaggy&#39;s head is the same in every set but the smallest, and shows a goofy grin on one side, and a worried frown on the other, with his trademark chin whiskers. &nbsp;It&#39;s been said before, but Shaggy really doesn&#39;t look properly scared with this head, which is odd, because he and Scooby were always the most cowardly characters. His hair is new and nicely sculpted, and his torso is minimally detailed but still quite accurate.</p>

<p>Scooby-Doo is the standing version here, and looks really nice, with his colors and printing looking just like the cartoon. His collar is nicely done, and his tail is rubberized to prevent it from breaking. His head is a separate piece mounted on a pin, which allows it to rotate and be switched between Scooby figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fred is exclusive to this set. He has a new hairpiece in cool yellow which represents his hairstyle well, and his typical outfit is nicely printed on his torso and continued with his legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Zombie here is probably meant to be the criminal&nbsp;Zeke in disguise, but the model for the Zombie has been recycled many times, and this color palette for the outfit was not Zeke. His face is in Spring Green, but I feel that the face is a bit too generic. He doesn&#39;t have the same sad/pathetic look, although the face looks good on its own. It also looks different without the pointy ears, but that can slide. The Zombie&#39;s tattered coat and shirt are printed nicely. Interestingly, due to his bald head, the Zombie is the only villain in the theme who cannot be unmasked. However, they&#39;ve still made it clear it&#39;s a costume by printing buttons on the back of his head holding together the mask.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly easy, and the techniques aren&#39;t too advanced.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The supplementary model and the threat here is a haunted tree. It doesn&#39;t entirely correspond to any particular villain from the show, but it still looks nice. It&#39;s rather short for the size of the face (a sticker, but a great one), but it&#39;s only a secondary build. The tree is actually an animatronic robot being controlled by the Zombie, as there&#39;s a control panel and a diamond (probably a power source) on the back. As a result, its arms can move on ball joints and the branches on top can be adjusted. There&#39;s no real place to put the Zombie, as there&#39;s not even a row of studs behind the tree to stand him on.</p>

<p>The Mystery Machine itself looks great. Its appearance is heavily aided by stickers, but I found them all to be fairly easy to line up due to the shape of the pieces and the stickers used on them. The floral-patterned dishes used as hubcaps and on the front are printed, though. The front seats Shaggy and Fred, or any other combination of the Mystery Gang, and the roof comes off and the sides hinge open to reveal the interior. There&#39;s a small kitchen area with a gigantic sandwich for Shaggy and/or Scooby, some retro computer screens with a radar scanner and the Zombie, and a row of jumper tiles for Scooby to stand on. The walls are stickered with some bulletin boards of information.</p>

<p>The only problem here is that the set as designed will not fit all four of the Mystery Gang. However, it&#39;s very easy to do so. Removing the sandwich and sink will give you seats for two of them in the back, though, and using sitting Scooby instead of the standing version will crowd the figures less.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is a great set. It provides an iconic vehicle and an exclusive team member, and has some good play value. I&#39;d recommend this to anybody interested in Scooby-Doo and this theme.</p>

"Copterman","2015-12-29T06:05:44.337Z","Iconic, charming, fun! What's not to love?","<p>This is my first Lego review. I just started collecting Lego last year after Christmas, and I&#39;ve greatly enjoyed it. I&nbsp;picked up 15 sets in 2015, this being my latest. I am an AFOL&nbsp;male (age 39) who grew up watching Scooby Doo. I used to have nightmares actually, but I couldn&#39;t resist watching.</p>

<p>I love all the light blue pieces which have&nbsp;a beautiful color tone. The spare tire and the hubcaps are printed pieces. Everything else is stickers. And there are a ton&nbsp;of stickers for such&nbsp;a small set.&nbsp;Placing the stickers perfectly was a challenge but one that I actually enjoyed. The Mystery Machine decals look especially &quot;groovy&quot;, but one must take care to line up the stickers so the word art adjoins. Many folks hate stickers, but this set greatly benefits from their inclusion IMO.</p>

<p>There are several fun play features. I especially love the printed newspaper piece.&nbsp;The computer screen found on the back of the monster tree reveals it is actually a robot. The large sandwich is cute as well as is&nbsp;the magnifying glass which your minifigs can keep on hand.</p>

<p>The set includes Scooby, Shaggy, zombie, and (most importantly)&nbsp;Fred.&nbsp;Zombie impostor has a head print on the back which reveals a couple of button, indicating he&nbsp;is wearing a mask.</p>

<p>Everything looks great. Super fun to play with and also to display as it is so iconic. Feels like it could&nbsp;be a Lego Ideas set.&nbsp;Get this set. Again, it is so iconic. LEGO did a great job with this design.</p>
