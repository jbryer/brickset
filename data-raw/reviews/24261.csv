"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-07-11T12:51:58.757Z","Quick Mini Review","<p>Gox&nbsp;is the first of the Series 5 Mixels of the&nbsp;Klinkers Tribe.</p>

<p>He has loads of character with a fully rotating eye and gold moustache; and great degree of flexibility with his double jointed arms, 3 fingers on each hand, his body is sitting on a mini turntable so it can turn right around, and his 4 claw legs.</p>

<p>All of the&nbsp;Klinkers have a good selection of gold, silver and brown pieces.</p>

<p>One note (not a complaint)&nbsp;I will make is that in the pictures and on the packets, the gold looks more shiny and metallic than the actual pieces are.</p>

<p>Gox has a lot of bars and clips, as well as the usual ball&amp;socket joints. All of the Klinkers have some kind of cogs and axles, for Gox these are used to give him a rotating eye.</p>

<p>Quick build time 3&frac12; minutes,&nbsp;including a Nixel.</p>

<p>I really like all of this tribe, Gox probably the least of the three, but he is still a great character and good selection of pieces.</p>

<p>He has a good ppp at 8 cents a brick and comes with great parts for making mixel&nbsp;mixes. You can get him new for about $7 us or used for $5 us. If you like the mixels&nbsp;series i would recommend getting this set and the rest of the tribe.</p>
