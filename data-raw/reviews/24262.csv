<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Bagged. Nice instructions, brief but solid.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The main thing that drew me to this Mixel was the parts/colors. There are several gold and silver parts, as well as some industrial-type pieces and six ball-and-socket joints. Great color scheme, useful parts pack.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Very easy, although some modest force is required to pop the joints into socket, and to attach the hands.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>This little guy has personality for miles, and is super-posable. There are eight points of articulation and the &quot;feet&quot; are surprisingly stable. Jinky&nbsp;has no trouble standing up while holding any number of reasonably adjusted poses.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>A great desktop companion. You can almost feel the caffeine when you look into his eyes, and his dynamic poseability&nbsp;is great fuel for the imagination. Again, this is a great tribal&nbsp;theme in its colors and concept, and I find it particularly appealing as an AFOL. This would be an excellent gift, even for people who might never look twice at most Mixels&nbsp;or buy Lego in general.</p>

<p>Jinky&nbsp;is the second of the Series 5 Mixels of the Klinkers Tribe.</p>

<p>This guy looks cool, big mouth and great face, big solid feet, and long arms. Plenty of articulation makes him very posable, even with his fixed face/mouth and long fixed arms.</p>

<p>A good selection of gold, silver and brown&nbsp;pieces, several ball&amp;socket joints, along with vehicle exhausts as arms. Jinky&#39;s cogs are on the sides of his feet</p>

<p>Quick build time a little under 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Jinky is my favourite of the Klinkers, he just looks fun and cool.</p>

<p>You can use this a monster, or rebuild it into an awesome vehicle!</p>

<p>I recommend this set to anyone!</p>

<h2>Positives</h2>

<p>Jinky is a relatively entertaining Mixel to play with, as he has many functioning parts. His body is full of pieces which match his theme of an old, steam powered mixel. These parts are also rather useful to use in other builds, such as the cogs on his feet, the steering wheel on his head and the pipes on his arms. Jinky also has a rather strange piece which is his mouth. I&#39;ve only ever got it from him (at the time of this review). He also plays a rather big part in building the max as the pieces mentioned above are almost all used in it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The max of the Klinkers is also rather fun as it combines most of the features of the 3 mixels into one, with the addition of the arms being able to fly around because of the cogs from the 3 sets. This makes it able to make the max into several fun positions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Negatives</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t many negative things to say about Jinky. But the first time I ever saw him I thought he seemed a bit scary because of the huge gaping mouth. If the mouth was changeable so that the teeth could move up and down&nbsp;it could be a lot better. Also, the technique parts can be a bit of a hassle especially if you&#39;re relatively new to LEGO. It&#39;s not much of a problem in this set but the max can definitely be a problem if you are unexperienced with LEGO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall, I find that Jinky is a nice mixel to build, however, compared to the rest of the mixels, this one may be slightly harder to build than the rest. Still, it deserves a 5-star rating.</p>
