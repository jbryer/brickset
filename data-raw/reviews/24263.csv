<p>He has a compact form, and quite a menacing expression (his eyes can be rotated to different angles), he&#39;s got cogs for ears, and his big right hand also rotates on a mini turntable.</p>

<p>He can hold a Nixel in his big hand, and give it a good spin.</p>

<p>As with the other&nbsp;Klinkers, he has a good selection of gold, silver and brown pieces, a few ball&amp;socket joints, 2 cogs and axles, and a mini turntable.</p>

<p>Quick build time a little under 3&frac12; minutes.</p>

<p>Kamzo is a great and fun addition to this tribe.</p>

<h3>Klinker&nbsp;Max</h3>

<p>This Max (a combination of the 3 members of the tribe) is really cool, and has, I think, a first for the Mixels - a cog drive articulation. Turn the axle handle on his back, and his shoulders rotate (in opposite directions) waving his multi articulated arms around. Each of his hands has 4 fingers, with&nbsp;an extra finger opposite the 3 (as&nbsp;Gox), which allows Klinker Max to get a hold of thinks,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;a couple of Nixels.</p>

<p>One of my favourite Max&#39;s</p>

<p>Quick build time&nbsp;6&frac12; minutes, There are a fair number of parts left over, enough to give him double articulated legs as well as his double articulated arms.</p>
