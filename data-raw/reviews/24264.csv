<p>He doesn&#39;t have as much articulation as some Mixels, but he still manages to have good character and decent variation in his poses.</p>

<p>There are&nbsp;some good parts including the transparent blue disc behind his eye, and the 3 icy weapon around it, as well as some pale aqua blue (Medium Azur) pieces.</p>

<p>Quick build time 3 minutes.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a fun guy, with some good unusual parts, but doesn&#39;t quite have enough articulation to really stand out.</p>
