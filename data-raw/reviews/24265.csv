<p>This guy really stands out as full of character and articulation. Those 2 little black bows as eyebrows really give him character and great expressions.</p>

<p>Lots of ball&amp;socket joints, claws, clips, and trans blue and medium azur pieces make him a good source of pieces too.</p>

<p>Quick build time&nbsp;just under 4&nbsp;minutes.</p>

<p>I really love this guy, those eyebrows really give him great expression, and his claws and many ball&amp;sockets joints give him great poseability.</p>

<p>He&#39;s definitely one of my favourite Mixels of all.</p>
