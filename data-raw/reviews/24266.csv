<p>Moderate articulation, but enough for a few different poses, and&nbsp;even with the white dots for &#39;teeth&#39; instead of some of the toothy parts, he still manages a fun cheeky expression.</p>

<p>Lots of blue and medium azure bow/slope pieces, including the long curved feet, and those ice swords for a tail.</p>

<p>Quick build time 3&nbsp;minutes.</p>

<p>This guys body geometry limits his articulation, which doesn&#39;t bother me as much as it would for a standing figure. He&#39;s a fun addition to the tribe.</p>

<h3>Frosticons Max</h3>

<p>This Max (a combination of the 3 members of the tribe) is really brilliant. Fantastic articulation with the multi segment arms, and clip fingers on the hands which each hold a flick missile. His big feet give him excellent stability, and lots of teeth and a ball&amp;socket articulated head allow for great expression.</p>

<p>One of my favourite Max&#39;s</p>

<p>Quick build time just over 10 minutes, and not too many parts left over.</p>
