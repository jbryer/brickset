<p>He&#39;s quite cute, with a characterful face which rotates (like a clock), and 4 ball&amp;sockets joints for pose-ability</p>

<p>There are a good set parts including the above mentioned ball&amp;socket joints, and a variety of pieces in that yellow/orange colour (Fl.Yell-Ora), as well as standard yellow.</p>

<p>Quick build time 3 minutes.</p>

<p>He&#39;s probably my favourite of the Lixers, but this whole tribe is a little lack lustre in my opinion.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Tail cannot be posed.</li>
	<li>Falls over a lot.</li>
	<li>The head spinning is cool, but it is really hard to position it to look normal.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still better than Seismo.</p>
