"8BrickMario","2015-06-21T20:58:57.303Z","In terms of appearance, this guy's got the others licked!","<p>The Lixers are a bizarre tribe of Mixels, but Turg stood out to me because of his especially bizarre design. Now that I own him, he&#39;s one of my favories.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for the Lixers is nice, with the blue-and-green rainforest background contrasting with the yellow package and the yellow/orange Turg. A cartoon image of him is in the upper right corner. The instructions are clear, but their folding is annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Turg has some very interesting parts. In Flame Yellowish Orange, he has two smooth half-arches, two 1x2 plates with clip handles, two 1x2 bricks, and the large trapezoidal plate he&#39;s built on. In Yellow the small bow pieces and the piece used to hold his legs joints are nice to have. Some transparent orange cheese slopes are also uncommon. Turg reuses Nurp-Naut&#39;s&nbsp;half-closed eye, and his tongue has some nice repurposes of creature tail parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was easy and enjoyable. Turg&#39;s unique body shape means that the typical &quot;core&quot; is missing from the early build. This is later added on to provide legs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What a wonderfully&nbsp;weird&nbsp;Mixel! He has such a unique bored/lazy appearance, and his long tongue can be twisted and turned to achieve different licking poses. His tentacle arms can be moved up and down, and the ends can be moved in the same way, providing multiple poses. His legs are so short and attached in such a way that they can only be rotated sideways and outward. His eye can also be flipped in different directions.</p>

<p>Turg is also the Lixer that comes with a Nixel. This design has arms that can be rotated up and down, and it has catlike ears. I don&#39;t like the way the feet are designed, since they are difficult to make out due to the sloping effect of the body.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like him. Turg&#39;s got a weirdness about him that makes him both charming and off-putting. He&#39;s got such a unique design, and so he is my second favorite Mixel (after Series 3&#39;s Torts). I would definitely recommend picking him up if you are interested in Mixels.</p>

"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-07-08T15:17:36.64Z","Quick Mini Review","<p>Turg&nbsp;is the second of the Series 5 Mixels of the Lixers Tribe. He has the longest tongue of the members of this tribe.</p>

<p>He&#39;s definitely weird, and looks a little unhappy for it. That tongue is just wacky.</p>

<p>There are some good parts in this, and in that lovely yellow/orange and standard yellow colours.</p>

<p>Quick build time 2&frac12; minutes.</p>

<p>Like most Mixels he&#39;s good value&nbsp;for the parts, but for me there&#39;s just not enough going for him in a tribe that&#39;s fairly middle of the road.</p>
