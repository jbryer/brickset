"CoffeeBrickMan","2015-07-08T15:33:22.833Z","Quick Mini Review (with Max)","<p>Tungster&nbsp;is the third of the Series 5 Mixels of the Lixers Tribe. He has&nbsp;a big wide tongue, and mini wings.</p>

<p>For me, this guy is just that, the&nbsp;tongue and the wings - the rest of him just doesn&#39;t do anything for me.</p>

<p>Parts is really what this guy is for me: 4 ball&amp;socket joints, and pieces in yellow/orange, yellow and red.</p>

<p>Quick build time just over 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Like this whole tribe, he&#39;s somewhat lack lustre. He&#39;s probably my least favourite of all the Series 3-5 Mixels. (I&nbsp;missed series 1 &amp;&nbsp;much of 2)</p>

<h3>Lixer Max</h3>

<p>This Max (a combination of the 3 members of the tribe) is most like Spugg with Turg&#39;s tongue and Tungster&#39;s wings. I quite like the balance of the front legs being closer together than the back legs - otherwise it doesn&#39;t seem to have enough character of its own.</p>

<p>Quick build time 7 minutes, and there were a lot of parts left over which I find rather disappointing.</p>
