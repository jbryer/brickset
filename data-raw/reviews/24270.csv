Despite being extremely MOCable, are these curious-looking creatures decent models? This is Kramm&nbsp;from the series 6 Mixels.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>This set comes in a plastic bag with an image of Kramm on the front. The instructions are folded *grr* and are easy to follow steps.</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Most of the pieces are yellow, black and grey. The best pieces are the 2 top pieces of the boulder and the light grey brick pieces.</p>

<p>Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is short but quite repetitive. It is very enjoyable, taking between 5 and 7 minutes.</p>

<p>Completed build</p>

<p>There are three playable features. The arm with the drill rotates. The boulder legs swivel and the other hand can be clenched around an object. The half-boulder legs are really cool and the mouth is inventive. My only criticism is that the brick imprinted pieces are wasted on the back of the model.</p>

<p>Overall, this is definitely worth keeping as a model. It is definitely worth the price and is probably the best in series 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good building experience from another creative them, which is construction. Great part usage from the boulders as feet. Good playability from the drill and spinning body. Good value as the details do in the Mixel&#39;s favor&nbsp;to show the construction theme.</p>
