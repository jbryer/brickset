The picture of Forx online and on the packet&nbsp;just does not do him justice. The photo angle makes&nbsp;him&nbsp;look&nbsp;quite dull but in hand its just great. Turn it on its side&nbsp;and he is far more interesting and even front on in hand&nbsp;he has so much character - he has a sort of troll like character. Forx has become one of my favourite&nbsp;Mixels&nbsp;so far. Its a little piece of yellow&nbsp;LEGO&nbsp;simple brilliance. : )</p>

"Hylocera","2015-11-30T03:18:37.233Z","His Mouth Spins!","<p>The title says it all. I was building LEGO &#39;n&#39; stuff with my sister when I happened to drop a minifig into Forx&#39;s mouth. Then I noticed the lower half of his mouth was set on a turntable. Long story short, it is a LOT of fun to launch figs out of his mouth.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I would give Forx around a 7/10 in the parts category, only because other Mixels have set the standards so high for the theme. Notable pieces are the short (5-link) chain, the dark stone grey bananas (his eyebrows), 1x2 yellow slopes, and those round 2x2&nbsp;black bricks on his toes. He actually only has 3 Mixel joints, so if you&#39;re looking to&nbsp;get those, I would not recommend this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I thought with a $5 set that the build wouldn&#39;t be very interesting. I was happily proved wrong. For a set at this price range, Forx had a fairly surprising amount of sideways building and semi-unorthodox techniques, like the bananas stuck into headlight bricks.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I believe the Brickset team rated this one a bit low for a lack of posability, but personally I love this guy. The possibilities for expressions on Forx&#39;s face are endless - his upper and lower &quot;jaws&quot; are set on joints and hinges (respectively) and can open pretty far, and the bananas can be tilted to make him look happy, sad, or anything else in between. He has pretty good balance, and I like to keep him standing on one foot, a pose he holds with the utmost easy.</p>

<p>My only gripe is that, since the minifigure heads used for his eyes are more than a stud wide, there is hole in the center of his head to make room for them, a hole which is pretty visible from certain angles. Other than that, this is a fantastic set, and with 65 pieces for $5,&nbsp;great&nbsp; value for money.</p>
