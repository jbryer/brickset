It includes a lot of repetition, but is pretty quick which is expected for a set this size. It isn&#39;t advertised that you get a Nixel in the set until you already have built the main Mixel, so that is a nice surprise and about the best part of the set.</p>

<p>Parts: The parts are pretty generic. It has a few good hinge elements and two printed eyes, but other than that there&#39;s lots of studs and bland pieces.</p>

<p>Playability: There are 5 points of action on the Mixel and 3 on the Nixel. The Mixel has on that moves the head up and down, two for the arms which are clips so there&#39;s not much movement there, the legs are ball joint&#39;s and swivel around very well which is the main source of play. The Nixel has a nice little chair thing that it sits on and that has two bars that go up and down. There is also a swivel feature on the bottom of the chair so the Nixel can swing to his heart&#39;s desire.</p>

<p>Value For Money: The original price was&nbsp;$4.99, &euro;3.99, which I think is very good considering the fact that the set has 74 pieces, includes a surprise Nixel,&nbsp;and the package is a pollybag. Overall this is a set that gets hidden in any collection and but is worth it for the price.</p>
