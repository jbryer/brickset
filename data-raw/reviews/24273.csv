<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>All the parts come in a clear plastic bag, with a folded set of instructions next to it. I&#39;ve had issues in the past with the clear bag being stuck to the outer bag, stuck where the seams are sealed. Luckily, this didn&#39;t happen this time, but it can, so if you&#39;re completely worried about keeping the bags intact, be warned. Other than that, it&#39;s just a standard Mixel bag.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Green. Lots of it. Six lime green 1x2 bows, a good amount of small ball/socket joints, a trans-green crystal,&nbsp;and of course, two magnifying glasses for the character&#39;s glasses. He&#39;s got one of the lowest piece count of this year for&nbsp;mixels, but&nbsp;52 pieces for 5 bucks isn&#39;t too bad. Good amount of SNOT-enabling bricks, too- two headlight bricks, two inverted brackets, and four 1x1 knobbed bricks. Fitting, seeing as these green guys are basically Snot Mixels.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty simple. Frame is pretty similar to Elvis/Niksput from earlier this year. Didn&#39;t take long at all.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Many Mixels have the problem of not being able to move their legs forward or backward, due to how they are attached with the ball/socket joints. This guy is no exception. Arms are short, but quite maneuverable. Ball/socket joint for the head means it can open its mouth, close its mouth, flip its head upside down and bite its nose... Whatever you care for. My favorite part of the design is the glasses. They look good and work well. The back of his head might be an isssue for some- it&#39;s not sloped and kind of looks like someone took a chunk out of it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This guy won&#39;t last long- I&#39;ll break him down for parts pretty soon. While he lives, though, he looks pretty nice, &nbsp;and when broken down, has a decent set of parts for green building. Still don&#39;t get why there&#39;s a Mixel swarm of Mucus Monsters, and I still don&#39;t get why they got second&nbsp;swarm of &#39;em. &nbsp;3/5</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>His arms are on ball-joints, which is an uncommon occurrence; and thus a welcomed inclusion.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
	<li>His feet can&#39;t move forward or backward. Fine, all Mixels are plagued with that issue, but I still got to penalize him for this missed potential.</li>
	<li>The crystal for the&nbsp;snot looks way to unnatural and artificial.</li>
	<li>More exposed studs than I expect from a Mixel, or any LEGO set awhole.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Not a bad set, not even a bad Mixel, just not as good as other Mixels.</p>
