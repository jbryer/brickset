<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>All the parts come in a clear plastic bag, with a folded set of instructions next to it. I&#39;ve had issues in the past with the clear bag being stuck to the outer bag, stuck where the seams are sealed. Luckily, this didn&#39;t happen this time, but it can, so if you&#39;re completely worried about keeping the bags intact, be warned. Other than that, it&#39;s just a standard Mixel bag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Green. You&#39;ve got some good pieces for articulation, always nice to have. Some nice inclusions include two of the 1x2 inverted brackets in green, something extremely uncommon, as well as some slightly more common 3x4 bowed bricks.There is also a funny-looking rainbow printed 2x2 tile.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing to hard to do, but notably, the top of his head is constructed and attached upside down, in order to use the toothed bits.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Unlike many Mixels, this guy&#39;s legs actually can move. His hips are done to allow them to move back and forth, and he has knees- or maybe those are ankles for giant feet? His arms are hinged, and only move up and down, which is unfortunate. I&#39;m guessing that the printed piece has some significance, but I don&#39;t follow the Mixel&nbsp;lore. I&#39;ll just pretend its a pizza box.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I won&#39;t lie, this guy is going to die. But as he stands now, he&#39;s not too bad looking. At 66 pieces, he&#39;s the best deal from a pure parts count, and has some uncommon parts as well. Still wondering why this guy&#39;s legs are apparently half made of snot, judging by his cartoon image.&nbsp;</p>
