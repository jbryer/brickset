<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>All the parts come in a clear plastic bag, with a folded set of instructions next to it. I&#39;ve had issues in the past with the clear bag being stuck to the outer bag, stuck where the seams are sealed. Luckily, this didn&#39;t happen this time, but it can, so if you&#39;re completely worried about keeping the bags intact, be warned. Other than that, it&#39;s just a standard Mixel bag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Well, it&#39;s green. Of the 53 pieces, only 46 go into the guy, the others going into the Nixel. The Trans-Green wings are pretty uncommon, as are, surprisingly, the Trans-Neon-Green cheese slopes. You get some parts for articulation, always useful, but other than that, there&#39;s not much.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty simple. He&#39;s the first dragon-form Mixel punk I ever picked up, so I can&#39;t compare to others. Didn&#39;t take long. The Nixel was pretty standard, being the version with the 3 ears.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Well, the legs don&#39;t move much, but that&#39;s not the point of him- it&#39;s the wings. He can flap &#39;em, and his tail is pretty flexible, with a balljoint on his butt and a hinge in the middle. The head is on a balljoint, but there&#39;s no jaw- just a nasty looking underbite. The Nixel&#39;s existance allows for some play combat. Dragon verses little black cube- it&#39;s like Beowulf, only worse!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This guy&#39;s living on borrowed time. He&#39;ll become spare parts soon. As he is, he&#39;s probably my least favorite of this trio. As novel as the idea of a snot dragon may be, he really doesn&#39;t deliver as a set. He&#39;s got some decent parts, however, and 53 parts for 5 bucks isn&#39;t horrible. And at&nbsp;the very least, he can always terrorize your Lego City setup!</p>
