<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice little polybag with a see through area to see the pieces, instructions&nbsp;are very straightforward and easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Great part assortment in hues of violet and some white. I love the semisphere&nbsp;and 4x4 circular lavender plate with a hole in the center used as stuffed cheeks(you can actually put 1x1 studs and flower buds inside, which also come in the set in lime green, blue, and yellowish-orange) &nbsp;Teeth, eyes, balljoints,&nbsp;and a&nbsp;circular 2x2 tile belly are nice, however if you want those, they are in lots of other mixels, too</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build uses a lot of SNOT(Studs Not On Top) for the cheeks, feet, arms, and belly and is a short but fun build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Cute, lovely, creative build are just a microscopic percent of adjectives I could use to describe this set. Well done Lego!</p>

<p>Looks like a cross between a spikey&nbsp;frog and a purple human, which only creativity and imagination can create! (And Lego builders too)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wonderful!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Snax&nbsp;is an adorable creature from the world of Mixels that I highly recommend to Mixels lover&nbsp;and part salvager alike!</p>

<ul>
	<li>Studs are exposed on the neck</li>
	<li>The&nbsp;eyes&nbsp;cannot express differently&nbsp;unless you manually remove and place them back.</li>
	<li>The inside of the mouth is lavender, which looks really... weird and scary.</li>
</ul>

<p>Still better than Seismo, again.</p>

<p>Building experience is meh as the body is very weak, when compared to the head. The parts are also meh, besides the purple pieces used for Snax&#39;s s cheeks. The playability is meh as there isn&#39;t much to do besides move. The value is also meh, as the Mixel is also exposed in certain areas such as the neck.</p>
