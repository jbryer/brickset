As the first &#39;double-decker&#39; Mixel, this was certainly a lot of fun to build due to the unique structure of this double personality mixel. I enjoyed building this set and then transforming this into the Mixels Max which is inspired by Vaka Waka and sits on my desk storing my money for me in its belly. I believe for the number of parts included that this is a good-priced set and is a lot of fun to play with.</p>
