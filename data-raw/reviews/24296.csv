"KingAlanI","2016-03-20T20:04:40.923Z","Good value and clever design","<p>This was a good deal on another good Friends Pop Star set. At 10c per piece, LEGO rounded down to $25 MSRP instead of up to $30 as with 41104 Dressing Room.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I love the packaging. The contours on the end and the shinier printing in some places stand out. I can open one end without destroying the box. Numbered bags really do help organize. I wish the instructions laid flat. It was cute to show a minidoll opening the set. Much of this also goes for other LEGO packaging and instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I liked the 1x1 round tiles instead of 1x1 round plates since those are so common. Pearl gold instead of white wheels was also a nice touch. 1x2&#39;s under the edge of the red carpet (instead of big plates under the whole thing) was a good way to make that section wider. It would be easy to make it longer with multiple copies of the set or loose parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As usual, minidolls don&#39;t sit down well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty easy to follow</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I removed the tiles and had them stand in the chairs. Putting a wheelbase on its side was one of many clever design decisions. The angled backdrop was unique, especially the embedded stars. Different layers of plates were a good way to do the steps.</p>

<p>The limo itself was very detailed and well designed. I&#39;m reminded of 41100 Heartlake Private Jet. However, that had no pilot and this has no driver. I particularly liked the working trunk and 4 footrests. Two minidolls can sit down right next to each other.</p>

<p>It would be easy to make the red carpet longer with multiple copies of the set or loose parts.</p>

<p>I also liked the building around the classic camera piece. The bouquet and bouquet holder were a bit fragile together.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good value and clever design</p>
