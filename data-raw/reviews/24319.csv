Grabbed one and headed for the door before they decided not to sell it...early. Managed to buy one and rushed home to build it with hubby after his return from a business trip. Great timing!</p>

<p>Many sets have a special meaning for some folks because of experiences they have had, and the Architecture Series is full of these sets. The Louvre has been one of our favorite places in one of&nbsp;our favorite cities for many, many years. So seeing this box brought back many fond memories of the ancient fortress now known as the Louvre. After a relaxing dinner and glass of wine, this was a fun &quot;date night&quot; build.</p>

<p>The design is first class with the facade of the old museum entrance facing the I. M. Pei glass pyramid covering the modern, oversized model of the&nbsp;underground entry. It is difficult for architects to mesh a modern appendage with an ancient classic;&nbsp;Pei excelled at this with his pyramid,&nbsp;which draws you into the building. There is nothing that jumps off the table about this set, but it is a fantastic representation of the real thing. And if you have been fortunate to visit it, you may feel as we do about this classic. (Hint: Allow several visits over multiple days to feel the fuller impact of the fortress, and avoid the summer and holidays. And make sure that you spend long hours hiking around the underground floors, which are fascinating.)</p>

<p>It is a thrill seeing famous old buildings come to life through the Architecture Series with the&nbsp;&nbsp;wonderful explanations in&nbsp;classy black books. This build entertained us for about 90 minutes at the end of a long day. And it can easily make a romantic date with someone with whom you have shared the museum experience. (This cannot be said about many LEGO sets!)</p>

<p>Let&#39;s hope that LEGO keeps surprising us with well designed sets based on landmarks that deserve our attention. Everyone can benefit from exposure to toys that promote the understanding of architecture. And from exposure to ancient buildings like this; my son as a teen adored this place; your children may feel the same after a visit or two.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A nice fairly quick build that depicts the exterior of one&nbsp;of the most iconic museums in the world quite nicely. The build itself is not the most interesting - much more variation for instance with the Guggenheim Museum - but the end result is worth it.</p>

<h2>Design of the set</h2>

<p>Based on the images in the manual and available online, the designer(s) of this&nbsp;set seems to have chosen to combine two elements of the Louvre museum into one display: part of the south wing of the Louvre palace facing the Court Napoleon (built under Napoleon III in the 19th century, and designed by Louis Visconti and Hector-Martin Lefuel) and the new entrance complex I.M. Pei, dominated by its once controversial and now famous glass pyramid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other words, when looking towards the &#39;old&#39; building, it is as if one is looking south. The entrance to the pyramid (and the current entrance to the museum in reality) is on the right side of the Lego pyramid.</p>

<p>The choice of for this combination I personally consider a good one. The Louvre complex itself is rather symmetrical and rigid in its design, and using this approach the final Lego display becomes more interesting.&nbsp;Had one chosen to offer a more traditional view facing to the east, the whole structure would have become symmetrical and IMHO rather boring. Also, to make the display manageable in size, the designers would have to forcefully reduce the distance between the glass elements and the stone structure even more than they have had to do now.</p>

<p>Overall I think the designer(s) has/have done a superb job, and captured the look and feel of the building very well.</p>

<h2>Building the museum</h2>

<p>For me the build itself left me with a somewhat conflicted feeling. It was interesting to see what building techniques and parts the designer(s) used to capture the shape of the buildings. The design of the pyramid deserves to be singled out for its clever design.&nbsp;On the other hand, the original architectural design of the Louvre itself&nbsp;forces a lot of repetition and limits&nbsp;the variation in the build. Fortunately, at no point does the build become tedious.&nbsp;Having built the Guggenheim Museum (21035) before, the difference in variety within the build&nbsp;is great.</p>

<p>For the same reason, there is a limited variety in parts, with some parts included in great numbers&nbsp;- for example some 40&nbsp;of 2x1 transparent plates, 41 2x2 grey tiles, and 36 2x1 transparent tiles. Again, the contrast with for instance the&nbsp;the Guggenheim set is great.</p>

<p>Overall the built was nice, especially when looking at the result. Build time was somewhere between 1 hour and 1 hour and 30 minutes. Although there is a substantial number of parts, the repetitive elements speed up the build quite a bit.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>As all models in the architecture series, this set is not meant for play, and for display only. As a display model, this one is of a nice size to display on a shelf or the corner of a desk. Also, some of the parts of the build - most notable the two central columns are only attached at the bottom - break off fairly easily.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>As with any architecture set, this is not a set for everyone - simply because part of the appeal of this set is based on personal taste and memories, as with most architecture in real live.</p>

<p>Overall, especially when you can pick it up on a reduced price, the set is IMHO worth it. Personally I am happy I got the set.&nbsp;The designers have done a good job in creating an interesting display, while capturing the looks of both the new pyramid and the old museum. At the same time the designers&nbsp;have done a good job by&nbsp;limiting the size of the display in such a way that it prevents&nbsp;the build from becoming tedious.</p>

<p>This set succeeds in doing what it is supposed to do: to be a nice display piece of an iconic building. Hence the 5 star overall rating, despite the 1 star for playability and the sligh downgrades for build experience and parts.</p>
