<p>Too simple!&nbsp; A small child could put together a minifigure.&nbsp; :-)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Very standard.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>How could you not own at least 1 of these?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Piece of cake!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great stuff!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The only thing bad to say is that Lego makes these little wonderful things far too hard to get!&nbsp; What Star Wars Lego collector doesn&#39;t have a Trooper army?&nbsp; So long ago,&nbsp;Lucus&#39;s people&nbsp;thought nothing about the command level of this clear army of troops, so you didn&#39;t see much in the way of leadership.&nbsp; Now we are in Rebels!&nbsp; They now have Sergeants and its only natural to have Lego Minifig Sergeants to build your own army!&nbsp; Only they are far too hard to find!&nbsp; So, if I could tell any serious collector any advice... get them while you can!&nbsp; At least 1.&nbsp; What could it hurt?&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; You&#39;ll be sorry if they never get issued any other way.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The polybag came with the typical packaging for the year of release and is simple but conveys the contents well. Inside you will find 5 LEGO pieces and one cloth piece for the trooper&#39;s pauldron. A blaster is included among the 5 pieces as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The same as any LEGO minifigure, though I would suggest helping a younger builder with the pauldron piece as it would be a shame to damage it during assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>Our sergeant is great looking. He comes with the same print as any Rebels TV series stormtrooper but with darker definitions to his grey lines and grey negative spaces. The pauldron in particular is of great value as it sets him apart from his brethren and gives him a more important air. Beneath his helmet we find an angry clone print but that is par for the course for these guys.&nbsp;He looks great next to any of his companions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>He looks great and is a worthy addition to any Rebels collector. Even if you are not and you managed to get him during the promotion then the pauldron is definitely useful. For army builders he is worth it either way. Though,&nbsp;I would suggest taking care of the pauldron as best you can as it is of the tougher cloth material and can wrinkle rather harshly if not cared for properly.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2019-01-07T00:31:36.547Z","Stormtrooper Sergeant","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Comes in normal Polybag&nbsp;bag and doesn&#39;t come with instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides the normal minifigure&nbsp;parts you get a blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This figure is a nice one to get. He is from the Star Wars Rebels show. He is exactly Identical to the normal stormtrooper besides the cape showing his rank. The detail on him is still really good. It shows the armor really well, along with the printing on his legs as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great figure to get to add to your Star Wars collection. Even though it is exactly like the normal stormtrooper, I really like it. The cape on the side of his arm to show that he is a sergeant. Overall it is a great figure which is why I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
