<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a standard size polybag, complete with a shot of the stuff on one side and legal jargon on the other. There were no dedicated instructions, and if you need instructions for this you should see someone.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with a standard blue Skull Spider, and an awesome Trans-Orange Tahu mask! It looks great on Tahu, but doesn&#39;t really work with the others.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Besides the mask and the spider, this set also comes with a poster, some stickers, and a little booklet that shows the Toa. The stickers are of the Toa&#39;s Golden Masks, and the poster has a very cool map of Okoto on one side and a picture of the Toa&#39;s masks on the other side.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would have paid the price just for the mask, but it&#39;s nice to see the other stuff included. Probably only hardcore Bionicle fans will want this, and it is definitely worth getting.</p>

"DarterTheVanquisher","2016-01-26T00:04:02.967Z","Worth Waiting!","<p>This set was part of an order to get Tahu Master of Fire. After waiting awhile it came!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It came in a simple polybag with some other things in the shipping box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Skull Spider mask in dark blue/purple is cool along with the Trans-orange Mask of Fire. I use it as a fully corrupted mask.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took a few seconds before I got to the main part of my order. you snap the Skull Spider together and pull out the mask.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Skull Spider is really cool as it adds another one to your army of them. The book is cool as it has the artwork showing the six Toa and Tahu and the Protector of fire together. The stickers are reflecting when you angle them, and are cool. The poster is amazing (I have it on my room wall!)&nbsp; one side is all 12 masks of power from normal to golden. The other side is the cooler in my opinion in that it is a map showing the location of all six golden mask and their shrines all over Okoto. The mask is kinda cool and now that the summer sets are long been released I use the mask of fire as a corrupted mask like we get in skull sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is worth it if you have it. if you are thinking about trying to buy it some where it is not really worth it in my opinion, rather get another mask stand and a golden skull mask.</p>

<p>I got this for free with the order of one of the Ninjago Possession sets. It&rsquo;s an okay freebie, but not useful to me. The build was virtually nonexistent, and the playability is zero without something to put the mask onto. The little poster is cool, as is the trans-orange element, but the spider is found in other sets. It&rsquo;s not a bad set, just not useful to me in any way. I guess it&rsquo;s more useful if you own the Tahu&nbsp;figure to put the mask on.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-08T18:29:14.82Z","Bionicle gear","<p>Lego set #5002941 is a fun little addition to any Lego Bionicle collection. This set was a promo back in 2015 from Lego.com and is pretty cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is in a polybag kinda like some of the promo Minifigures.</p>

<p>Inside you will find a fun little sticker sheet of the different Bionicle masks from the 2015 Netflix show. Also inside is a tiny comic book, a trans-orange mask, a skull spider, and best of all a Bionicle poster. The poster is double sided; one side with all the masks on it and the other side with a picture of the Bioicle island map.</p>

<p>This set is not really worth more than $2.00 in my opinion but is great if you want to collect some Bionicle gear.</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is fun, but only those who like gear items should purchase this.</p>
