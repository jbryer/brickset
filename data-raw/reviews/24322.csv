To a really great effect, LEGO Elves does what LEGO Friends tried to do, introduce innovative new colour and model designs in a truly fantasy setting. In the world of LEGO it&rsquo;s even possible that both Heartlake City and the land of Elves are connected. Anyway this is the smallest set offered from the Theme, does it stand out? Read on to find out.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The model is a nice little scene with a bit of a tree attached to a bench, perhaps meant to be carved out of a living mystical tree, hence the magic in the name of the set. The fire is represented by a few orange clear plates and a stud, which is placed under the bench, very odd design choice honestly.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Azari Firedancer Mini-Doll included here, cheapest method of getting this mini-doll, who has a very nice selection of new mini-doll parts. Her lower torso is a nice half-length skirt with allusions of flames at the hem. Her top has a nice print matching the two-toned light orange dark pink skirt and includes the fire theme of the character. She also has a symbol printed on her left shoulder, looking like a tattoo signifying her mystical powers.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Colour choice of pieces quite nice in this set, with a light purple leaf piece, some nice light orange plates and dark red 1x2 bricks.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Again the price-per-piece ratio is a bit unfair. There are 27 pieces only, and for 6$ that is a bit much, even with the nice selection of unique colours for the set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The design of the model is slightly odd, it does make for decent play, however it still seems odd to have the fire located underneath the bench. And why is Azari roasting red apples over an open flame anyway?</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I would recommend tracking this down to flesh out your LEGO Elves display if you&rsquo;re a really big fan of it. Polybag completists definitely need to track it down if they didn&rsquo;t already. The sat may be quirky, but still fun, and can be a good way of getting Azari without spending 40$ for her specific set. Unfortunately it doesn&rsquo;t include the magic key that they are searching for, which is a huge shame.</p>
