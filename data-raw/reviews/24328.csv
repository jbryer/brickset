No specially moulded nose-sections here, as per Utility Shuttle 60078, which would have been on the shelves when this model was handed out.</p>

<p>Given this was a freebie set, given to attendees at the Lego Shop&#39;s monthly mini-builds&nbsp;of February 2015, it represents unbeatable value for money. It might even be worth sourcing on the secondary market for a few pounds.&nbsp;</p>
