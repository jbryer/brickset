It&rsquo;s also got some decent design elements that work in capturing the likeness of this vehicle. I really enjoy the look of it and feel that it&rsquo;s a great little set and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is relatively quick to build and offers a great vehicle design in miniature scale, includes decent uses of parts and colours to capture the likeness fairly well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Two flick-fire missiles are included for play features that situate under the wings and are very nicely tucked away so as not to detract from the look of the model.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Wings and cockpit can be angled however you&rsquo;d like.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>No printed markings to indicate the Avengers or SHIELD logo.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I recommend this set for fans of Super Hero polybags and the Quinjet model in general because this is a really nice polybag. The price wasn&rsquo;t too bad either for what it was, though it is somewhat difficult to find these days.</p>
