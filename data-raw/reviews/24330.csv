<h3>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Sorry, technically not a box, it&#39;s a polybag. Instructions are typical of freebies, come folded up and open up to one large page.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Super brief build. Build the Spidey dude, then build upwards for the center of the robot. Build the 6 identical legs and the tail, and DONE! The build was simple enough that after looking through the parts, I didn&#39;t need the instructions (basically, it&#39;s really easy, I usually need them).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Eh... the set does come with 6 metallic silver fang pieces (used in Ninjago&#39;s fang blades in 2012 I think) along with 2 metallic silver 3x3 radar dishes. Nothing much else...</p>

<h3>Playability&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Playability is laughably low. Spidey doesn&#39;t even come with his white vine piece! The robot is so stable (thanks 6 legs) that the [controversial] super jumper and Spiderman can&#39;t knock it over. Green flick missiles on the robot to shoot at Spidey, who ALSO is stable on his Super Jumper xD</p>

<h3>Minifigure(s)</h3>

<p>Your typical Ultimate Spider-Man, with decent detailing on his head and torso... it&#39;s just that they have been using this since 2012 and have not retired this figure yet!</p>

<h3>Price</h3>

<p>Woohoo! It&#39;s a freebie, need I say more about how worth it it is? Sure, it comes with just 38 pieces, but that&#39;s 0 cents per piece!</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Nothing special at all. But hey, it&#39;s a freebie, so if you can get it, why not?</p>

<p>However, other polybags like Winter Soldier or even Captain America&#39;s Motorcycle may interest you more if you have the Spiderman figure already.&nbsp;</p>

"AETerry","2021-03-08T01:38:18.833Z","Spider-Man Jumper Set","<p>For a small plastic bag set, this isn&#39;t bad. It&#39;s a great impulse purchase and an easy way to get a Spider-Man Minifigure. You get one of those new clear jumpers to simulate a character leaping through the air as they battle the metallic drone or Spider-Slayer that the main build of the set comprises.</p>

<p>There are a couple of flick missiles to keep the action going. Piece count-wise, you&#39;ll have enough for a quick and entertaining build.</p>
