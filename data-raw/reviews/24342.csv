<p>The box comes in the usual attractive packaging. The box is rather large I feel.</p>

<p>It comes with 2 easy to follow instruction booklets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>In terms of parts count, this set is great value for money! Some might just get this set to bolster their Pirates/Soldiers numbers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s rather&nbsp;disappointing in this field. C&#39;mon! A soldier as the King?&nbsp;An Admiral will be more suitable for the most important chess piece!</p>

<p>Pawns not wearing soldiers&#39; hats? The good guys&#39;&nbsp;uniform just looks rather lacking without their epaulets.</p>

<p>The Bishops could have been represented better with minifigures I feel.</p>

<p>Each side gets a &#39;Joker&#39; pawn, holding a banana / bread, instead of the cutlass / rifle. They also wear a different hair piece against their fellow pawns.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Thanks to the improved building instructions we get these days, the build is made simpler, with each step&nbsp;showing the bricks required.</p>

<p>The build is easier when&nbsp;compared with the Pirates playsets within this series.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The contrasting sides of the beach and the sea makes this model look very attractive. The fun part of it is that you can take it apart into four&nbsp;main sections, stack&nbsp;them up and neatly display the set&nbsp;as beach scenery!&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This is the most appealing feature of this set in my opinion.</span></p>

<p>The box compartments underneath the game board allows you to keep the chess pieces after use.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&nbsp;felt&nbsp;rather disappointed&nbsp;with&nbsp;the minifigures given in this set.</p>

<p>If you do not have any Lego chess sets previously, you will find this a great set to start with.&nbsp;Otherwise, you might be better off with the previous chess set&nbsp;versions released.</p>

<p>The main positive about this set is its feature to compact it into a display model.</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2015-03-21T19:38:49.72Z","Arr, ye be using the Queens Gambit opening, well-played swabbie!","<p>Is there a subset of the LEGO-purchasing population that enjoys chess as well as LEGO, so much so that it&#39;s worth periodically releasing a themed chess set? There is evidently some marketing wisdom behind this and so it keeps happening. The most iteration was the Kingdoms chess set (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/853373-1/LEGO-Kingdoms-Chess-Set"">853373</a>) in 2012&nbsp;that had a fancy moulded&nbsp;border around it, though I would argue that this Pirates chess set is the successor to the magnificent brick-built Castle Giant Chess Set (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/852293-1/Castle-Giant-Chess-Set"">852293</a>), which probably went out of production in 2009 or so as I was coming out of my &quot;dark ages&quot; and therefore missed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I&#39;m going to be honest here and you can decide whether you want to read the rest of this review or not: I am not at all a chess player and therefore bought this set solely for the minifigs and for the parts, which I will be primarily offering my perspective on. I do, of course, have the instructions sitting in front of me (which surely can be downloaded as well), so I will talk briefly about how I think the overall build might look to someone who did have a desire to build the whole thing according to the instructions. That&#39;s the caveat, and I want to be honest so that my impressions don&#39;t mislead anyone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is exclusive to official LEGO stores only, which means that your only chance of getting it is to traipse down to your local branch if you are fortunate to have one near to you or to order it via the website. The only reason why this is relevant is that you probably can&#39;t be too optimistic in terms of hoping for a discount on the US$60 price, especially considering that the set was sold out almost right away when it was first released. But while most exclusive sets tend to have hard-to-swallow prices for that reason, I find that this is actually pretty great value considering the 800+ piececount and the whopping twenty minifigs&nbsp;that go along with it. Considering that most army builder type sets consist of four minifigs for $12 or so, that&#39;s already a pretty good deal by comparison. And yes, this is non-licensed and there&#39;s also something to be said for economy of scale blah blah but I&#39;m trying to say something nice, okay?&nbsp;</p>

<p>So you get ten pirates and ten soldiers, all armed to the teeth and ready to battle. Each side has a &quot;king&quot; and a &quot;queen&quot;, and these, of course, are the most special of the bunch, with the rest being pretty generic. And by &quot;pretty generic&quot; I mean a lot generic. The pirates fare a bit better because they share two different torsos, two different coloured bandanas, and three colours of plain pants among the eight, while the soldiers have to make do with one uniform, white pants, and very generic &quot;City&quot; hair. What&#39;s a bit more of a disappointment is that the female pirate and the female, er, soldier have torsos that are themselves recycled from the older Kingdoms line, so if you&#39;ve collected those, you&#39;ll have &#39;em already.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say that they&#39;re bad by any means, of course - they certainly harken back to the golden age of LEGO Pirates and do a good job of looking more modern while still conveying that nostalgic look. Just note that they are very, very generic looking and will serve their purpose as &quot;background figs&quot;, if that&#39;s the goal. And if you&#39;re going to play chess with them, the generic guys are the pawns, so no worries there, I reckon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, I did not actually build this set, so I can&#39;t comment on how it ultimately looks when completed, though the last page of the instructions makes it clear that the board can be split apart (via Technic pins), and the decorations on the side can be placed on top of the two halves. The board also contains a hollow interior for you to store the &quot;pieces&quot; when unused, which is pretty cool. For younger kids who are not into chess, the &quot;closed up&quot; build provides a nice play area all on its own with a sweet palm tree on a region divided between beach and ocean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you <em>don&#39;t </em>intend to actually build the chess set, however, the parts included are a godsend for anyone hoping to cobble up some Pirates MOCs. Lots of generic sand-yellow and blue bricks, lots of tiles, a palm tree, sand-yellow slopes, and all kinds of details for beefing up the other retail sets in the line. The large baseplates themselves are incredibly useful as starting points for a fort or for landscaping - the massive 16x16&nbsp;plates are available in only very few sets, and this is an affordable way to get quite a few of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I personally have not had the opportunity to own any pirates since my childhood days, so I&#39;m keen on reliving the dream. However, it&#39;s pretty noticeable - at least in my opinion - that the retail builds are quite simple, probably deliberately so, much like how <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Castle/year-2013"">2013&#39;s Castle sets</a> were most likely an attempt by LEGO to introduce a new generation of builders to themes that&nbsp;are universally beloved by AFOLs. Therefore, I optimistically hope to put together a few builds of my own using the retail models as inspiration, and appropriate spare parts are going to be highly useful in this endeavour. That&#39;s the basis on which I say that the parts included in this set are incredibly useful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re thinking about collecting the 2015 Pirates and are looking for an army and parts builder to beef it up, you can&#39;t go wrong with this. And I guess it&#39;s a pretty cool looking chess set that has a lot of playability (outside of a chess game itself, naturally...) as well as functionality - though I&#39;d probably remove the palm tree if you plan on taking it on the road.&nbsp;</p>
