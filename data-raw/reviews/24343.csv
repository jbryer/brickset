I got this set in 2019 as my eighth Buildable Figure. However, this was one of the first wave of Star Wars Buildable Figures, so I&rsquo;ll keep that in mind as I write this review.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: 5/5</strong></p>

<p>He&rsquo;s an excellent parts pack if you want black CCBS bones and shells. None of those pieces seem particularly rare, but I suppose it&rsquo;s always good to have more. All but one of the shells are have no printing, making them more easily reusable. Beyond that, 75110 also contains plenty of small technic pieces as well. On the rarer side are four flat silver lightsaber hilts, a green lightsaber blade (otherwise only available on 75112 Grievous), and flat silver handcuffs and chains. The silver handcuffs are still exclusive to this set. And of course the exclusive head mold and printed Star Wars torso shell, which seems generic enough to reuse.</p>

<p><strong>Build: 3.5/5</strong></p>

<p>For its time, the build probably was amazing for CCBS figures in terms of coverage and form, but unfortunately this type of build has become extremely standard for Star Wars Buildable Figures. Being my 4th figure with this build, there was little new. Only saving grace was the technic gun and the calf build being new to me.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: 5/5</strong></p>

<p>75110 Luke Skywalker is a joy to play with. All 13 standard ball joints are present. Head, hips, ankles, and wrists have full range of motion. 90 degree bends at the knees. His shoulders are limited by the shells used on the torso, but nothing too major. And best of all, his elbows are use open sockets, allowing the much appreciated bicep swivel. Lego would unfortunately use locked elbows on later figures.</p>

<p>As for accessories, he comes with a lightsaber, a stored lightsaber, a pistol, and handcuffs. Lightsaber works as usual. There&#39;s no geared arm swinging function, being from the first wave, but the set is still great without it. The extra lightsaber hilt is attached to his right hip, so you can pretend it&#39;s his stored lightsaber or an extra.There&#39;s nowhere to keep the activated saber if you take it off. The gun is a nifty little build and stored on his left hip, a great feature. The handcuffs are meant to replicate scenes from Return of the Jedi, and add a little bit of extra fun. There&#39;s no given way to store them. Personally, I just stuff them in the hollow space of his torso.</p>

<p><strong>Price: 5/5</strong></p>

<p>$19.99 at time of release. Star Wars Buildable figures have always been a little pricey, but considering they use larger shells and bones, in addition to the &ldquo;license tax&rdquo;, I suppose it works out alright. It does help that this was before the standard price of Buildable Figures rose to $25. This set contains also more accessories than most other buildable figures in the entire line, greatly increasing its value. This set can be found for around $10-$15 nowadays if you&#39;re still interested in one.</p>

<p><strong>Appearance: 3/5</strong></p>

<p>Visually, 75110 is a very boring set, made almost completely of black parts and unprinted shells. If it weren&#39;t for the fact this represents Luke Skywalker in Return of the Jedi, I doubt this set would have been as desirable. On the flip side, this set is irritatingly close to having a perfect color scheme. The pure black body is broken by dark gray friction adders in the hips, a few light gray bushings, and red axles.</p>

<p>I also have some issues with his torso. The torso shell, meant for armored characters, is horrible for normal clothes and makes Luke look way too stocky. The shell used for back coverage sticks a little far off the back when viewed from the side, and is rather gappy. Size 3 shells for the shoulders would&rsquo;ve been better for shaping and articulation in my opinion.</p>

<p>And uh, that head. Lego hadn&#39;t quite figured what style to make the human heads just yet, and Luke is an definitely a sad result of experimentation. He is just barely recognizable. His head is too elongated and has the wrong facial features. He can look better as long as you don&rsquo;t look at him head on..</p>

<p>I can forgive these issues since Luke is still fairly accurate and recognizable, and since it was Lego&#39;s first go at these types of figures. They still had some learning to do.</p>

<p>His arms and legs are fine.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Rating: 4/5</strong></p>

<p>While not perfect, 75110 Luke Skywalker is a good representation of the character and loads of fun to play with due to its fantastic articulation and great accessories. He&rsquo;s a welcome addition to my collection and a great companion for my modified 75534 Vader.</p>

<p>This set comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 5.6 x 10.3 x 1.9 inches and weighs 0.48 pounds.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some really cool parts in this set. You get Luke&#39;s head, two handcuffs, and a lot of the black armor (that I won&#39;t name because there&nbsp;is a lot of pieces). The new green lightsaber blade is a really cool piece to get in the set. You get two printed parts which are Luke&#39;s head and the front chest armor. Overall some really good parts. The total piece count for the set is 83.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me less than 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a decent buildable figure from Star Wars. I own two buildable figures (the other being General Grievous which is an amazing one) but this is still a good one. The head is a little weird looking, but still looks enough like Luke to make it work. Luke is armed with his green lightsaber (six pieces) and a small blaster (ten pieces), both that look great. Overall this is a decent buildable figure to get. This is Luke from Episode VI Return of the Jedi (which was the draw for me) and looks like he pairs well if you have the buildable Darth Vader. I do recommend getting him if you are a fan of Star Wars or just to add to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
