"XerxesDGreat","2015-09-06T05:58:30.87Z","Feels Overpriced, But A Great Set","<p>While I think this set is great, I purchased it at the same time as 75099 (Rey&#39;s Speeder) which had more pieces and was 33% cheaper. I know that the pieces in this set are much more specialized and fancy than the parts for the speeder, but I can&#39;t help feeling a little ripped off for spending $10 more for fewer pieces.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions were mostly clear; box was properly sized. Only issue I had was the typical one I have with dark sets: figuring out exactly which grey was which.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not many generally reusable parts, but the ones there work excellently for the CCBS&nbsp;system</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>n/a</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fairly simple; took me about an hour. Nothing fancy, just making sure that the pieces are aligned correctly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>LOVE this model! Totally poseable, very easy to play with; my four-year-old can play endlessly with it!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not disappointed with the model, even though it was more expensive than I felt it should be. Still glad that I bought it though!</p>

<p>However, I decided to take the plunge on Darth Vader as I do feel that the figures &#39;look&#39; better when representing those who are largely machines ,or wearing armour.</p>

<p>Upon starting to build the model, it&#39;s immediately obvious that it comes more from a Technic background than from a &#39;standard&#39; Lego background, making use of multiple ball-joints and Technic pins, for example.</p>

<p>Thankfully, it also uses printed pieces (rather than stickers) for Vader&#39;s chest-piece and lights - a big plus in my book :)</p>

<p>The final model is impressive, standing roughly 30cm tall, and fully poseable.&nbsp; However, it can be hard to balance.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions are easy to read. Comes in a standard Lego box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Com s with a lot of ultra build parts and some exclusive pieces suc as darth&nbsp;vader&#39;s&nbsp;helmet.</p>

<h3>Mini-figures</h3>

<p>No minifigures are included in this set</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took a little longer to build than e average Lego set because I am not the biggest ultrabuild builder.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is ok because it is hard to make it stand up and I am not the biggest fan of the way they put the cape on.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think the overall rating is &quot;fine&quot; lol</p>

"legochuck","2016-01-30T04:09:01.223Z","Great for your Father, not as much for your Luke.  ","<p>As the second Lego Darth Vader buildable figure, I feel this incarnation of our favorite Sith Lord lives up to its predecessor, although it lacks in some areas.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is&nbsp;a great parts selection in this set, especially if you enjoy building with the CCBS system.&nbsp; Most notable is the helmet piece, which is printed on the front, and offers an excellent level of detail.&nbsp; The cape really makes the model, and the printed breast plates definitely add to the overall look of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build is surprisingly complex for this model, offering up a lot of technic building in the torso section.&nbsp; Even with the robust technic build, the shape of the body is very well done and smooth.&nbsp; The arms and legs are pretty much standard to the CCBS system, with the exception of the rear calf, which is made up of some technic parts and black teeth.&nbsp; The only complaint about the build is the slightly bulky shoulders, which cause the build to look more muscular than robotic.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model stands almost eleven inches tall and is great for display on a shelf or desk.&nbsp; Although you can play with the model, there are no action features in his saber wielding hand, which would have been nice for playability.&nbsp; Joint articulation is good but not great, as the elbows do not bend as well as they could without twisting the fore-arms to the side.&nbsp; It is also rather easy to disconnect the legs or feet joints, as they are only connected by rigid ball and socket lengtheners.&nbsp; It works well for pose-ability, but not as well for play. &nbsp;Overall however, the armor looks great and gives a nice sense of realism to the entire model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would definitely recommend this set to anyone interested in Star Wars and Lego.&nbsp; Its a great piece to pose on a desk and it looks good for multiple angles.&nbsp; For play, it does lack some features that could really make it stellar, but I think kids would still enjoy having the classic villain in their collection.&nbsp;</p>

"Minifig290","2018-03-02T13:34:24.54Z","One Of The Best Build-able Figures EVER","<p>When LEGO started selling the Star Wars Buildable Figure line in late 2015 people were excited for the Darth Vader figure which was the second most pricey of the 6 released. But as the Sub-theme continued the sets got worse and pricing also got worse but Darth Vader was always a strong seller that is&nbsp;probably why they redid it in 2018.</p>

<p>This set sells for &pound;25 and has 160 parts with a 15.6p price per part.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Darth Vader is the only build in this set and he is marvelous. His head piece is very detailed with small bits of silver printing on. His torso consist&nbsp;of a printed chest piece that is has great printing on it with a sign that has printing for some buttons etc.</p>

<p>Both of his arms are identical that have a printed arm plate for some detail. Same with his legs but they have some more parts to them. Vader is holding a light saber in his left arm that uses a new (at the time) trans red part that is a rubbery plastic material. His cape is of the newer and softer cloth and attaches from the neck and chest.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are 6 exclusive parts in the set, his torso has three exclusive parts one of which is a road sign that has some technical print on it. Also his head is also only i this set, while his cape is only in this set and the newer 2018 Darth Vader (as im aware of). Also there are 6 printed panels that only come in this set.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>For a set that was to introduce a new Sub theme for star wars it is brilliant. There are a lot of great parts and detail. This set is full of play features so you can move his arms and legs and head and lightsaber.</p>

<p>Definitely worth buying and is better than the 2018 version by miles as he is perfectly sized, priced and full of great features.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great play features, It is priced well enough and perfectly sized</p>

<p><strong>Cons-</strong>&nbsp;None To Mention&nbsp;</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-08-02T06:25:43.343Z","Best of the buildable figure sets","<p>So I really had no interest in these buildable figure sets as I didn&rsquo;t really think they were truly Lego sets, but then I found 7 sets for $30 at a garage sale so figured why not. I got Darth Vader, Luke, Obiwan, a Clone Trooper, Finn, Captain Phasma, and a Storm Trooper. This Darth Vader set is easily the biggest, most detailed, and the best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The piece count is of course the highest and that is due primarily to his elaborate torso which is mostly built. Other buildable figures only have a plate that snaps on in front. So If you enjoy building, Darth Vader is the only set that really allows you to build. Are they Legos? Well that&rsquo;s debatable, some parts are but many are unique to this building system which is very un-Lego-like but does incorporate a little bit of technic parts. For the most part this system is simple to build so the complex torso makes this fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end you wind up with a buildable action figure that has some pretty amazing details given it is built almost entirely of modular parts. While it is fairly durable, I don&rsquo;t think it would hold up well with my 4 year old playing with it, and my 2 year old definitely would destroy it. From a playability point of view I&rsquo;d say all sets are equal with an exception for Finn who has a mechanical component to his arm, although I&rsquo;m not sure a young child would appreciate that as much since you could always just move his arm &nbsp;</p>

<p>At the end of the day, these sets were worth the price I paid, and definitely make more sense when you have many so that you can play with them together. But I would never pay the retail price for these sets. For that same price I&rsquo;d rather buy a regular action figure and a regular Lego set which would offer a lot more to play with, especially since my kids are too young even to play with an already built figure.&nbsp;</p>
