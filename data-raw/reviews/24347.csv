color:#141823"">First Impression:<br />
March/April came across last year and we were expecting &#39;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#39; sets or at least one that included the much desired Winter Soldier minifigure. We all thought that we would never see one until recently with the rumours of a UCS Helicarrier and some speculated that it will be in the set to make it harder to obtain and create more demand like the Heath Ledger&rsquo;s Joker in the UCS Tumble<span class=""textexposedshow"">r. About a month ago LEGO done the press release and it turned out that LEGO will be indeed be releasing a UCS Helicarrier but didn&rsquo;t include Winter Soldier! Finally we have got our Winter Soldier in all its glory in a small ploybag but it&rsquo;s not rather easy to obtain.</span></span></p>

The Winter Solider minifigure again shows how advanced and detailed the can have their minifigures. I&#39;m not sure where &#39;Avengers Initiative&#39; comes into play but shouldn&#39;t this have the &#39;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&#39; logo on the bag instead. It&#39;s got very nice details but one thing I&#39;ve noticed is that it&#39;s too cartoony. The face has a robin style mask which is completely incorrect unless it&#39;s based on a comic book or TV show. In the movie he has goggles and a detachable mask which is also another issue I have. The other face has a printed mask, WHY? Couldn&#39;t LEGO at least provide us with a Ninjago mask instead! It&#39;s understandable that these ploybags tend to have no new pieces and make use of what is already in the assortment and help promote the normal sets. The torso is magnificent but the legs could have had more details. It would have been nice to get a gun or a knife as an accessory but I guess that would be too much to ask for since it&#39;s only available with the Helicarrier which is a display model so I guess they don&#39;t need to as this and the Helicarrier is for collectors and not for play. </span><span style=""color: rgb(20, 24, 35); font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.3333339691162px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">We&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(20, 24, 35); font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.3333339691162px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">could have got a shiny hand as well to ma</span><span style=""color: rgb(20, 24, 35); font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 19.3333339691162px; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">tch with the arm.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size:10.5pt;font-family:

This is FREE with purchases of the Helicarrier and contains 4 pieces. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Marvel or Captain America this and the Helicarrier are not worth missing. The prices for this will sky rocket in the secondary market because I believe it&#39;s the hardest ploybag to obtain, &pound;269.99 isn&#39;t cheap for a toy/model. But it&rsquo;s defiantly not worth paying for the Helicarrier just for this figure.</span></p>

Overall this not one to be missed if you&rsquo;re a fan of Marvel or Captain America. It has its flaws such as limited use of details and a mask. It&#39;s not detailed as the Guardians of the Galaxy minifigures but is still impressive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"pagani88","2015-08-09T14:02:49.23Z","freeeeee!","<p>earlier this week, I went out to my local Lego store to pick up the new Ferrari F40, and was given this for free. Not bad.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>standard minifig polybag. A large image of the Winter Soldier adorns the front, with the parts count, recommended age and other info on the left hand side. There is an Avengers Initiative logo in the lower right corner. Instructions aren&#39;t needed, and aren&#39;t included.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PARTS: There are only 4 parts included in this set, the ones to make the minifig.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Of course, only one here. He has a hairpiece which has appeared before a number of times, and all the other pieces are exclusive. His head has two faces, one with a mask covering his mouth, and the other a grimace, with a mask over the eyes. His torso is black with front and back prints, consisting of armour and straps. he has a metal arm with a soviet red star and lines printed on it, to represent layered metal. His right leg is printed with a holster on the front and side.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>about three seconds to do.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>already explained this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>overall, this is a great minifigure, and will look good in anybody&#39;s collection, especially a marvel collection. And it&#39;s free, so you can&#39;t go wrong with that!</p>

"Lordmoral","2015-10-11T03:48:49.627Z","Almost on target","<p>Hello everybody and thanks for taking the time to read my review of an amazing minifigure.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>No instructions are provided as building is pretty much straightforward where the only thing you have to know is that this minifigure has two faces (classic face mask and the Capt America 2 Winter Soldier version). The polybag is also pretty well made.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The selection of parts is amazing except that it could have very well included some sort of weapons (other than his robo arm). The ideas could have been: sniper rifle giving his deadly display on the Winter Soldier movie or his granade&nbsp;launcher that fires metal adhering capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Spoilers</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>The one minifigure it includes is the titular Winter Soldier who is Capt WW2 friend turned Hydra unwilling hit man during a very late period of time. Has reversible face and the printing is glorious. His robotic arm has the Red Star of his affiliation with the Soviet Union. His torso features an empty gun holster that could have been included with him.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You just decide what version of the WS you want based on the face.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A great mini figure&nbsp;that is missing accessories</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As I stated this is a superb figure that will be highly sought after giving his importance in Caps America movie and I hopefull that where Lego to include him on future sets he should be given a lot of accessories (weapons).&nbsp;</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-09T00:31:04.687Z","Bucky or Robin?","<p>Review 8 is another mini figure in a poly bag,&nbsp;5002943-1: Winter Soldier. Is the only set that comes from the best standalone movie in the MCU as good as the source? Eh....</p>

<p>Build/Minifigure: Well, there are only 4 pieces in this set. The hair, head, torso and legs of James Buchanan Barnes, aka Bucky aka the Winter Soldier. Simple and to the point, the parts are partially unique and partially not. The head has two faces, one that looks like a DC Nightwing or Robin print while the other is the unique mask from the source material that only covers the nose and mouth. Much the same is on the torso, where a plain black arm and hand is paired with the unique sliver arm and hand printed with the red star. This arm is really sharp with its black lines to give the appearance of the paneling found in the source. The legs are plain black with a printed holster on the right thigh. Nothing too special here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts that are unique are really great and make for an outstanding figure, however, so much is repeated or plain that it mars the overall product. It&#39;s too bad such a great movie never got the set or sets it deserves. I found this on OfferUp for a great price, but I wouldn&#39;t pay too much like this set can garner. Overall it&#39;s just an eh set for me.</p>
