Bizarro say so.","<p><strong>LEGO Justice League vs. Bizarro League:</strong> The second LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes special takes us away from rehashing LEGO Batman video game plots and introduces an all new story for young and old viewers to enjoy. Loaded with the typical LEGO humour this film is a great addition to the LEGO Specials lineup.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>This film has a great looking box which showcases many of the characters from the film in Minifigure form. The back has a nice write-up and overall this product pops on store shelves with the bonus Minifigure prominent in the centre of the front of the box demanding your attention. All in all a great presentation that is sure to entice young fans to want this film.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Batzarro: Batzarro am world&rsquo;s worst detective. Batzarro&rsquo;s Minifigure am terrible, worst torso printing ever, leg printing included, yes! New Batman Cowl used, yes! Cape has no holes and looks terrible.</p>

<p>All silliness aside, the Batzarro Minifigure included with this special is a really nice addition to the DC Super Heroes staple of characters. It&rsquo;s unfortunate Bizarro himself is still only available as an SDCC exclusive, and I highly doubt LEGO will make the rest of the Bizarro league, however we at least have Batzarro and Bizarro. I do like the torso print too, it&rsquo;s unfortunate they didn&rsquo;t use the new cowl piece for this character though. The double-sided facial print is a nice contrast to the typical head prints found on Batman himself. The expressions appear to be similar, with one side brooding dark knight and the other smirking Adam West.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>We have not only a great new special to watch which introduces a host of new Minifigure characters, but some bonus materials as well including the prequel to this LEGO Batman Be-Leaguered television special, a blooper reel for the television special and an introductory featurette for the Bizarro league. Not much to watch, but better than later specials which seem to have cut back on the content in favor of sticking to one special.</p>

<p>The jokes, the animation, everything is what you&rsquo;ve come to expect from LEGO specials of this sort and the voice cast is top notch. Everyone is in top form as we get to hear Batman argue with Superman, Lex Luthor complain about the Justice League not helping him and Darkseid&rsquo;s imposing and evil voice as he perpetrates his sinister plot to destroy the Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This special improves on the original LEGO Batman special, and you&rsquo;ll enjoy watching it again and again with your kids who are LEGO DC fans. The inclusion of Batzarro is also greatly appreciated, overall I strongly recommend picking this up if you still can find it anywhere.</p>
