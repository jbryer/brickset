Instead it&#39;s in the novelty section of the Lego&nbsp;store, where&nbsp;the desk calendars, keyrings and drinking mugs accumulate. Despite looking like a house at first glance, it&#39;s supposed to be&nbsp;a container for pens, pencils etc.</p>

<p>The cheerful&nbsp;yellow box is larger than the other sets in this part of the store, e.g. seasonal sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing fancy, but a good selection of 1 x n bricks in blue and yellow, and a fair few&nbsp;red roof slopes. With 174 parts, this set offers plenty of bricks for your bucks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>?Like the house itself, the figures are&nbsp;rather old-school. A gentleman with an interest in the construction trade, and a lady prepared to swoon in admiration at such a gent.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Clever techniques?&nbsp;Novel use of parts?&nbsp;Nope. The build is as&nbsp;<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">s</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">t</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">ra</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">ightforward as you would imagine.&nbsp;My 5 year old boy was able to follow the instructions and build with me.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">The apex of the house sits on tiles, so it can come off to allow quick&nbsp;access to the attic room. There&#39;s just about room for a hat-less minifig in there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Quite charming. Maybe it&#39;s the proportions, or perhaps&nbsp;the simplicity, or possibly the basic colour scheme.&nbsp; Or is it because it reminds me of &nbsp;Lego&nbsp;models&nbsp;from the early eighties&nbsp;when the world was a much simpler place?&nbsp;Whatever the reason, something about this little&nbsp;house appealed to everyone in the family.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s one problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the balcony should be, there&#39;s a hole. Which is fine if you intend&nbsp;to use the house as a pencil pot &nbsp;- &nbsp;as per the official name of the set&nbsp;and indeed the illustration on the box. However, if you just&nbsp;want a basic Lego house, you&#39;ll probably want to carry out some home improvements. My son and I enjoyed adding a balcony, some railings, some water in the yellow planter on the left,&nbsp;and&nbsp;windows round the back of the house. You will need nothing beyond the kind of bricks you get in a basic starter box&nbsp;to do this.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A charming vintage-style house.&nbsp;Great value for money. Easy to improve and adapt. Although this is at&nbsp;the opposite end of the spectrum to the Parisian Restaurant, it&#39;s still got a lot going for it.&nbsp;</p>
