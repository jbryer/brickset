<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>Very sturdy, dishwasher and microwave safe, and looks alot like the minifigure accessory.</p>

<h3>cons</h3>

<p>The color is not very common for the minifig version if it is even made in this color and also you can&#39;t (if you want to keep it in its normal condition) let it become colder than 32F or hotter than 203F.</p>
