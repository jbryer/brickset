The build is fast, and the head &amp; arms motion is very robotic.&nbsp; There are spares of the tiny pieces, extra dots &amp; red 1x1 plate.<br />

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Polybag with paper instructions</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of dots. I liked the translucent -blue dots best.</p>

<p>I loved the single panel PRINTED robot gauge - plate</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>none</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>In minutes - but I did need to follow the instructions, and carefully place the dots &amp; 1x1 (lantern) bricks in the head.</p>

<p>Th<strong>e completed model</strong></p>

<p>I will display this on my desk.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I loved this.&nbsp; A nice build with some complexity, but most kids could do this.</p>
