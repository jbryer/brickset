"Odeinoichus","2016-06-29T16:41:23.53Z","Sunday Best/Date Night Marge.","<p><strong>Set #71009 Marge Simpson: </strong>This variant of Marge is at least a true variant, while she shares a head with her previous releases the torso and legs as well as her accessories are all unique.</p>

<p>Wearing an orange dress, Marge&#39;s torso has a nice simple feminine print on the front and dual molded arms with orange and white combined to represent her long gloves. Her legs are mostly yellow with an orange belt covered by a cloth dress piece with a single black line for her hem area. Her accessories include a bouquet of red flowers and a small clutch purse, made with a 1x2 printed tile.</p>

<p>Overall this version of Marge is better than her husband when it comes to date night, or sunday church visits, as she&#39;s commonly seen wearing this dress for fancy occasions. Interestingly she is not wearing her necklace, which is something I think is odd because she tends to never take it off. Recommended.</p>

The second figure found in the series is Marge Simpson. If you read my previous review of Homer Simpson, you know that this series is in no way off to a good start. Maybe Marge will change my opinion! This figure released in the spring of 2015, where she retailed for $3.99 US dollars.</p>

<p>Right off the bat, I like Marge more than Homer thanks to her exclusive head. It differs from the previous sculpts regarding her red lipstick, which certainly does a great job differentiating her from the previous Marge Simpson figures. The moulding&nbsp;on that sculpt is simply marvellous, with those individual bulbs of hair, and I&#39;ve always been in love with the head sculpts released in both Simpsons Series&#39;.</p>

<p>Since this is Date Night Marge, she uses a new torso that sports her show-accurate orange blouse. Now I&#39;m no fan of the show, in fact I&#39;ve never watched an episode in my life, but I&#39;m pretty positive this rarely ever appeared in the series. I understand that it was featured, but not very much. I remain pleased LEGO chose to include a different variation of the character, however. Her torso sports no back printing, but her dual-moulded white and orange arms are goated.</p>

<p>In the show, Marge&#39;s orange blouse features a prominent and poofy skirt, which is captured using a cloth attachment and some printing. I appreciate the use of a physical skirt, since it adds depth to the character. There&#39;s no printed detail on the legs.</p>

<p>Marge includes two&nbsp;accessories, but they admittedly aren&#39;t mind-blowing. A small 1x2 dark blue tile is used to represent a purse. It works surprisingly well, and the printing on it is good. She also includes a bouquet of flowers, which uses the green tri-stemmed part, and those snap-off red flowers. Both are reasonably good accessories.</p>

<p>Overall, though she is quite a bit better than Date Night Homer, I&#39;m not the biggest fan of Marge. I appreciate the differentiation between this figure and previous Marge Minifigures, but I&#39;m still not a large fan of her. I&#39;ll rate her 3 out of 5.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it for this review. Keep an eye out for more Simpsons Series 2 reviews! Thanks for reading!</p>
