<p>Dr. Hibbert has an awesome torso which is really quite useful, there aren&#39;t that many doctor prints in LEGO form after all and this one isn&#39;t specific to any one character, it&#39;s a buttoned up shirt with an undershirt and a tie and a stethescope hanging around the neck. The overshirt/overcoat print carries on to the legs showing the bottom of the Doctor&#39;s outfit. His head sculpt is also very impressive with a huge grin and a pleasent expression on his face. Homer&#39;s X-Ray is printed on the 1x4 tile piece and it looks stunning, matching up with what fans know from the series.</p>

<p>Overall Dr. Hibbert is a must have minifigure and has great useful parts for fans of MOCing hospitals and Doctors for your own creations. Highly recommended.</p>
