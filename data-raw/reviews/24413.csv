This particular figure was given to me by the lovely folks at shopforme.com.au at one of their new store openings.</p>

<p>If you live in Australia, they&#39;re one of the only places to get reasonably priced LEGO...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s the standard collectable minifigure packaging with bright Simpsons colors throughout&nbsp;and you&#39;ll struggle to open it without scissors!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are the standout in this figure. The short legs are not helpful to anyone (come on LEGO, redesign these!) but the torso can be used to give any minifigure&nbsp;a rumpled shirt and tie and the &#39;void&#39; license is wonderfully detailed.</p>

<p>The best part is the head. Everyone should&nbsp;have a Hans Moleman head in their collection as it can be added to almost anything for a laugh.</p>

<p>Darth Moleman, giant mech Moleman,&nbsp;Metalbeard-Moleman.</p>

<p>The possibilities are endless.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This minfigure is fine and the parts are some of the more useful in the Simpsons line. He&#39;s one of the harder to find characters (three to a case) so&nbsp;if you&#39;re good at feeling for individual characters, seek him out for comedy value alone.</p>

<p>Hans has a pair of short legs in green, a simple torso with a single-sided print featuring a long tie and the collar of his white shirt and he has a great looking head sculpt. As Homer once said kissing him is like kissing a peanut and this sculpt captures all of the wrinkles and charm of the character quite nicely. For an accessory he includes a printed 1x2 tile with his voided driver&#39;s license. Poor Hans, guess he should have tried harder to impress Patty and Selma at the DMV.</p>

<p>Great little figure definitely recommend tracking one down if you missed him previously. The level of detail on the printed tile is sheer gold, I certainly hope LEGO City starts issuing printed driver&#39;s licenses for their Minifigures as good looking as this.</p>
