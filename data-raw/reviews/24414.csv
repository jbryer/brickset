Not only is it a clever pun (BARTman, geddit?) but it suits Bart&#39;s character perfectly. So you can imagine how glad I was when LEGO announced it would be part of The Simpsons minifigures series 2. It doesn&#39;t disappoint.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As mentioned in previous reviews, the Simpsons minifigures only come with a blind bag and a checklist (again, handy if you want to keep track of your collection).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts included are absolutely perfect for this minifigure. Of course, you&#39;ve got Bart&#39;s head, body and legs but you&#39;ve also got a cape that perfectly captures Bart&#39;s Bartman cape in The Simpsons. Not only that but Bart finally comes with his slingshot.</p>

<p>Why has it taken this long for a Bart minifigure to come with the iconic slingshot? It&#39;s a essential part of Bart&#39;s character; arguably more so than the skateboard included in series 1. The slingshot is perfect for this minifigure; Bartman didn&#39;t have a utility belt in Three Men And A Comic Book (the episode his appearance seems to be based on) so the slingshot is literally the next best thing.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Bartman closely resembles his appearance in The Simpsons. The head mould is nicely detailed with Bart&#39;s Bartman mask and the cape is just perfect.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward, although putting the cape on the minifigure could offer a challenge. I managed to do it fairly easily this time but&nbsp; if you haven&#39;t put a cape on a minifigure in a while, you may find this tricky (no instructions are included, annoyingly).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>See minifigures.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>LEGO Bartman is a fantastic minfigure, closely resembling his TV counterpart. He comes with the iconic slingshot, which of course suits Bart&#39;s character perfectly.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-29T17:01:35.18Z","Everybody do the Bartman!","<p><strong>Set #71009:</strong> As Minifigure variants go this one isn&#39;t much of one, he is dressed in pretty much the exact same outfit as the previous CMF Simpsons series, the biggest difference being that his torso no longer includes back printing for the slingshot. That being said this version of Bart is still pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Bartman is Bart Simpsons&#39; alter ego, donning a short purple cape and a funky looking bart shaped purple mask, Bartman rises in the schoolyard to take on the bullies and save the day. (Or at least ideally that&#39;s the story he&#39;s sticking with and you won&#39;t get him to say anything else on the matter.) This version has purple mask printing, a short purple cape and the new slingshot piece. This accessory is very nicely detailed and looks great, I hope we&#39;ll see it used quite often now that it&#39;s been sculpted.</p>

<p>Overall this version of Bart is a very nice looking one, and I strongly recommend it, I may be biased since Bartman is something I remember fondly from my younger days, it&#39;s great satire based on the famous Dark Knight done in a Simpsons way. Definitely worth tracking down if you missed out on this series.</p>

"sideswinger","2023-04-28T22:42:43.42Z","New mould, new colours, great buy!","<p>Hey everyone! Sideswinger here, and it&#39;s been quite awhile since I&#39;ve reviewed any LEGO CMF&#39;s. Perhaps you haven&#39;t seen my name on the side bar on the homescreen. I&#39;m not sure if you should be happy about that or not (I imagine seeing the &quot;recent reviews&quot; tabs chock-full of CMF&#39;s gets annoying), but I&#39;m back, whatever the case! I&#39;m ready to continue my quest to review every single CMF ever made. I&#39;ve been on this adventure for almost 3 years (dang!), and I&#39;m not about to quit. Today&nbsp;we&#39;re reviewing Bartman from LEGO Simpsons Series 2. This released in May 2015, where it retailed for 4 buckaroos. He includes 5 pieces.</p>

<p>Okay, okay, okay, let&#39;s start at that head piece. This is pretty frickin clever! It uses the original Bart head sculpt from 71006 The Simpsons House, a piece that was later reused in 71005 Bart. This time around, since this is Bartman himself, the masked hero included just that - a mask! The purple cloth is printed around the entire rim rather than dual-moulded in, but keep in mind this was before dual-moulding was a super popular thing. And since this was 4 dollars, I&#39;ll let it slide. The moulding atop the head is great, but my favorite details are his slanted eyes that signify determination. I love that!</p>

<p>Bartman has a matching violet cape. I love the inclusion! Keep in mind, CMFs in 2015 rarely ever included felt capes; this instead uses a stiff fabric. It works just as well, however. Now as far as this torso goes, it&#39;s pretty much why I love this figure as much as I do. Context: back in the day, when the first Simpsons series and The Simpsons House released, Bart had a straight-up red shirt. His scarlet attire kind of angered Simpsons fans, since it didn&#39;t look entirely accurate. Well as you can see, LEGO gave us a more colour-accurate orange shirt in Series 2. I&#39;m not a Simpsons fan, but I absolutely appreciate that! No torso printing is present on either sides, but the dual-moulded arms make up for it. Since Bart&#39;s flesh is yellow, the orange sleeves are usable for civilian characters.</p>

<p>The legs are tri-moulded in sky-blue and yellow. I really dig them, however that aren&#39;t exclusive. As far as his accessory goes, his iconic sling shot is included! It was introduced in this figure, and it looks awesome! The tan band is printed on a reddish-brown base, and it fits Bartman.</p>

<p>Overall, even though I&#39;m not a Simpsons fan, I love this design! The clever reuse of the head sculpt, the excellently recoloured torso, and the brand-new mould for that slingshot all combine to make for a stellar figure! This one&#39;s an easy 5 out of 5 stars for me. If you&#39;re&nbsp; Simpsons fan, I recommend this one.</p>
