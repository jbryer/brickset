I had wanted to pick him up for the Earth Green legs, and recouloured plunger. I wasn&#39;t particularly interested in the minifigure itself, just the parts, but surprisingly, it&#39;s grown on me.</p>

<p><em><strong>Packaging and Instructions</strong></em></p>

<p>The packaging is light-blue with a bright-yellow border, and shows nine of the sixteen minifigures against a sky background. Willie is present, which is nice. The LEGO, Minifigures, Simpsons and Series 2 logo appear, as well as the &#39;1 Minifigure Included&#39; warning, the age range and set number. The back of the packaging is the same colour, on which the barcode and usual warnings are present.</p>

<p>The leaflet has the usual checklist, which declares the Groundskeeper to be Minifigure 13. The back of the leaflet advertises the Kwik-E-Mart, set 71016.</p>

<p><em><strong>Parts</strong></em></p>

<p>The parts selection is very nice. Not as nice as some, but it is a very useful one. The head is a new element, of course. The Bright Red against Bright Yellow work very well, and I like the shape of it. Even if it isn&#39;t useful, it looks great. The torso is the dark-tan colour, with an apron print. The short-sleeves are present, which is nice. The legs are in a rare colour, Earth Green, and it&#39;s nice that they aren&#39;t printed, as CMFs typically have the decorated legs. The plunger is the same as the CMF Plumber&#39;s from Series 9 (71000), but with a Reddish-Brown handle. It&#39;s nice to get recolours of parts that haven&#39;t been around for a while, and this one, while not the most inventive, is a nice one, as the Reddish-Brown looks particularly striking against a bright background.</p>

<p><em><strong>The build</strong></em></p>

<p>The building is over in a matter of seconds, as it is with all Collectable Minifigures.</p>

<p><strong><em>The completed Minifigure</em></strong></p>

<p>Groundskeeper Willie is one of those &quot;wow&quot; minifigures. For a Simpsons minifigure, I&#39;m impressed. The colours are well done, and the overall look to the minifigure gives you a feeling of satisfaction, even if you aren&#39;t a fan of The Simpsons, like me. TLG will find it difficult to give us a better version of Willie, as this one is almost unbeatable. The overall look to the character is good, and he&#39;s one of those minifigures that you&#39;re pleased to own.</p>

<p><em><strong>Overall opinion</strong></em></p>

<p>TLG tried and succeded in making a great version of Willie. There isn&#39;t much to say about him, but he&#39;s well done, and has some great parts that are useful to own. If you&#39;re a MOCer, I&#39;d advise getting one, and then ordering extra plungers and legs. It&#39;s a very well done minifigure, and as TLG can make some great Simpsons Minifigures such as the ones in this series, I&#39;d like to see what else they can come up with. Excellent minifigure.</p>

<p><em><strong>My Rating: 10 / 10.</strong></em></p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-30T15:42:11.05Z","I Don't Do Windows!","<p><strong>Set #71009 Groundskeeper Willie: </strong>It&#39;s another great character in minifigure form from Series 2 of The Simpsons and who should it be than none other than Groundskeeper Willie.</p>

<p>With a dual molded set of arms and a great simple looking torso print with a pair of green overalls and a dull tan under shirt this torso will work great with other Minifigures. Especially as it includes minor printing on the side for the shaggy arm hair this character is known for. His legs are unprinted standard green and his head is nicely sculpted with a shaggy beard, large bushy eyebrows and his facial expression is brilliant. The new plunger piece is included as well, it&#39;s a nice accessory and great to get multiples of.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say Willie here is definitely a must have minifigure. He&#39;s got great parts for making different figures with standard heads in LEGO City, and the character is just one of the great favorites from the series so fans will want him. Recommended.</p>

"Speed_champions_fan","2018-08-16T08:39:27.533Z","""Willie hears ya, Willie don't care.""","<p>The second simpsons minifigures series dealt with a number of characters who missed out on an appearance in the first series. While a number of major characters never got minifigs (lenny, carl, moe, doctor nick, barney, SKINNER!) I&#39;m glad willie did indeed show up.</p>

<p>His head is moulded to try and translate his... unique appearance into 3d. It is, I believe, dual moulded, giving a very sharp and therefore excelleng contrast between his yellow skin and red hair, beard and eyebrows. The prontong for the eyes is fine, while the teeth at either edge look a little awkward and I wonder if the figure would have looked better without them. Also, his top lip sticks out an enormous ammount, although this is indeed accurate to the show.</p>

<p>His torso is dark tan, with a simple print depicting a collar and dark green&nbsp;overalls with a pocket. His arms are dual moulded to show his&nbsp;short sleeves and some hair is printed on his forearms. Thire is no back printing.</p>

<p>The dark green legs are perfectly appropriate. No printing is present, and none is needed.</p>

<p>He comes with a functional plunger with a dark brown handle, which I think was in this set first. While a rake may have been more approptiate, the plunger was an existing piece and I can see why lego picked it.</p>

<p>Groundskeeper willie is my favourite simpsons character, so it was great to see him as a minifig. While he&#39;s not perfect, his torso and legs are quite generic and could easily be reused. Unfortunately, je has been off sale for a number of years, but this figure is a must-have for simpsons fans.</p>

<p>I like the simple torso detailing, the head mould is really accurate, though we don&#39;t see the SImpsons characters from the front in the show and I love his plunger! Such&nbsp; an useful and elegant piece!</p>
