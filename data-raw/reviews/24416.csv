<p>Comic Book Guy has to be one of the Simpsons&#39; all-time funniest characters. A parody of comic book nerds, Comic Book Guy resembles your average fan who takes to online forums to rant about everything. Oh, and he runs The Android Dungeon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Simpsons wouldn&#39;t be the same without Comic Book Guy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>As with other Simpsons minfigures, Comic Book Guy comes with a checklist and a blind bag. Again, the blind bag is annoying and limits the ability to choose the figure you want.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Comic Book Guy comes with two pieces to go in his hand that more than make up for the &pound;2.40 price. It&#39;s nice to see a Squishee bottle in LEGO item size and the &#39;Everyman&#39; comic tile suits the character of Comic Book Guy well. It would have been nice to see a Radioactive Man comic instead of Everyman but the 4*4 tile does its job.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>LEGO Comic Book Guy is a extremely detailed minifigure and one of the best in the LEGO Simpsons series. Like the other minifigures, it closely resembles how the character appears in the long running cartoon and nicely captures his personality.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward, although getting the Squishee&nbsp;bottle in Comic Book Guy&#39;s hand is hard and extremely fiddley.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>See &#39;minifigures&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Comic Book Guy is a fantastic minifigure which closely resembles his appearance in The Simpsons. Best. Minifigure. Ever.</p>

Ever!","<p><strong>Set #71009 Comic Book Guy: </strong>Many Fans of The Simpsons are well aware of the Comic Book Guy, a crotchety disgruntled retailer who is a huge fan and complains about everything. His true name remains a mystery, everyone simply refers to him as The Comic Book Guy, and so here comes the first new figure from Series 2 of The Simpsons CMF.</p>

<p>This Minifigure, like many of those found in The Simpsons, is a must have character, but he&#39;s also great for impressive looking parts. His torso is, again, a single sided one with a heavyset man&#39;s bulging tummy sticking out from his dark blue t-shirt. His arms are dual molded for a short sleeved look and his legs are single molded with a print of the dark brown shorts the character is known for.</p>

<p>Accompanying him is a printed tile of Everyman issue #11, Comic Book Guy&#39;s own written and drawn title. And of course he also comes with a lime squishee. An awesome accessory if ever I&#39;ve seen one, we hardly get any variety out of LEGO when it comes to beverage containers, the mug and the goblet are the two most prevalent accessories in LEGO City and beyond. It&#39;s nice to see them starting to branch out, this could be used for slushees, slurpess or any other type of iced beverage of that nature.</p>

<p>His head sculpt captures the scowling nature of his character quite nicely and looks great, overall I&#39;d say this is one of the better offerings from this Series and definitely worth tracking down if you missed out the first time. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Being my favourite side character along with Ned Flanders this is a great figure based of a hilarious character .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>&nbsp;The head like other Simpsons CMFs is unique to the chapter and showcases minimalist printing and an incredible likeness , the torso while being very basic shows an exposed stomach hunting at his present in the show , erm.......size and the legs are very nicely printed and have nice side printing to accompany it plus he has dual moulded arms .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessories include a very cool 2&times;2 white tile with a printed everyman comic and a very useful dual moulded squishee cup . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is one of my favourite Minifigures and I believe is popular with others too , the detailing while being so simplistic works so well and I recommend it to many .</p>
