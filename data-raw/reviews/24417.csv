"Dalekbuster523","2015-05-17T00:02:29.093Z","""The real heroes are out there, toiling day and night on more important things!""","<p>And so there&#39;s a second Milhouse minifigure, this time centered around Milhouse&#39;s brief stint as the live-action Fall-Out Boy. With a cameo appearance in The LEGO Movie and two appearances in the LEGO Simpsons minifigures range, I think it&#39;s fair to say LEGO are fond of Milhouse...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What next: Milhouse in LEGO Dimensions?</p>

<p>Anyway, without further ado let&#39;s &#39;Up and atom&#39; at Radioactive Man&#39;s request to the review of this set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a blind bag that really could have done with instructions due to one fiddly piece (more on that later) and the inclusion of a cape. I had no idea how to put the cape on the minifigure and could have benefited from some instructions explaining how to do it.</p>

<p>As usual, you get a checklist which is helpful to keep track of which minifigures you currently have but the packaging is once again spoilt by being blind bag. Again, this wasn&#39;t the minifigure I was after. I wanted Comic Book Guy, not another Milhouse.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set comes with three pieces of the minfigure to assemble as standard with LEGO minifigures (the head, the body and the legs) as well as a cape and can of Buzz Cola. This represents great value for money, although I would have also liked a 4*4 Radioactive Man comic.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this blind bag, you only receive one minifigure (Fallout Boy).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is much more complicated than Maggie, which in some respects is a good thing. It certainly makes the build more enjoyable. However, trying to fix the Buzz Cola can onto one of Fallout Boy&#39;s hands is incredibly frustrating. So is trying to place the cape on the minifigure; neither are explained in the blind bag and the blindbag could therefore have benefitted from some instructions on how to put the minifigure together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Fallout Boy looks suitably &#39;Comic Book&#39; and is very nicely designed. He closely resembles Milhouse as Fallout Boy in The Simpsons; LEGO really couldn&#39;t have done a better job.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a great set for anyone who doesn&#39;t have the original Milhouse minifigure from series 1. However, if you already have Milhouse I&#39;d try to avoid this minifigure if possible.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-29T17:10:15.13Z","Jiminy Jillickers Radioactive Man!","<p><strong>Set #71009 Milhouse Van Houten:</strong> Six of the Minifigures from Simpsons Series Two were variants from Series One, which might seem like a waste considering the number of folks in Springfield with tons of charm and personality, however LEGO is in the habit of maximizing their profits for including new sculpted pieces.</p>

<p>This version of Milhouse is from when he got the part of Fallout Boy for the Hollywood Movie Radioactive Man. And this figure looks great, with dual molded arms and a charming little light blue costume with a radiation symbol and a green &#39;utility&#39; belt, Milhouse looks great. His face is printed with the green mask and he wears a short green cape. For accessories he has a new piece for a soda can.</p>

<p>The soda can piece looks great, and I really can&#39;t wait to see how LEGO re-uses it, perhaps in officially licensed Coca Cola sets or something, the soda can looks much better than the more traditional approach with the smooth stud topped cylinder piece. Overall I recommend this minifigure, the parts are pretty useful too, and that new soda can is just superb.</p>

<p>Milhouse as fallout boy is a fun figure which cleverly reuses the Simpsons series one head mould .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The head is the same life as the series one heading has New printing with the head band and eyes , the cape is the older more papery material in short lime green , the torso is very simplistic but exceptionally accurate and the legs are triple moulded .</p>

<p>The accessory-</p>

<p>His accessory is the disposable coffee cup piece but with very nice buzz cola printing . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good figure with a very nice part reuse but in the grand scheme of Simpsons Minifigures it is quite undesirable but it is still reccomendable .</p>

"sideswinger","2023-04-29T17:18:40.687Z","Not a fallout figure!","<p>Hey everyone, Sideswinger here, and today we&#39;re reviewing Fallout Boy Milhouse. This character released in 2015 in The Simpsons Series 2, where he retailed for 4 buckaroos and included 5 pieces.</p>

<p>Atop the figure is an excellently moulded head sculpt. This is not a new mould, in fact it&#39;s reused from Milhouse in the first Simpsons series. The integration here is pretty darn genius, however, since it uses the same sculpt while still capturing the superhero mask using printing. The blue hair could&#39;ve been executed a little better regarding accuracy to the character, but the use of printing for the green mask and red glasses is fantastic. The bulbous nose is moulded nicely as well.</p>

<p>Much like Bartman, Milhouse includes a cape to match his mask, making it lime green. This doesn&#39;t use the soft, felt fabric, but rather the classic stiff material. This torso benefits from simple printing, but it has enough detail to satisfy me. I appreciate the radioactive emblem, as well as the green belt. But my favourite thing here has got to be his dual-moulded arms. The blue sleeves on the yellow flesh make them usable outside this setting.</p>

<p>Milhouse&#39;s legs are tri-moulded sky-blue and yellow. They look great, but they aren&#39;t exclusive. Milhouse&#39;s accessory is without a doubt the coolest part of the figure. I absolutely adore this soda can mould, which is not a new mould, but rather a recolour of the disposable coffee cup piece introduced in 2011. Its red colouring combined with a gay lid does a great job representing Buzz Cola.</p>

<p>Overall, Milhouse, while he uses no new moulds, is a brilliant figure! It makes great use of two existing pieces reprinted to fit the setting, and the dual-moulded arms help the case. 4 out of 5 stars!</p>
