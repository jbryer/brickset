<p>Edna has a nice looking torso with a green sweater over her shirt, her legs are bare aside from the hips as you attach another cloth skirt around them in a sort of greenish or blue tone, honestly depending on the light it can be either or. Her accessories are episode specific, a picture of Gordie Howe and a pink mug for her coffee. Both very impressive, especially the printed tile as while it does depict a character from the real world it is his Simpsons Universe counterpart. Her head is nicley sculpted as well capturing her likeness and typical bored/disgruntled expression quite well.</p>

<p>Overall Edna is a welcome addition to the Simpsons Minifigures collection and I would definitely recommend her. Her parts are quite nice as well and it&#39;s always nice to get printed tiles.</p>
