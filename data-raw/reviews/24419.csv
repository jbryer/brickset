"Allemov","2015-07-28T18:21:54.593Z","The worst minifigure in this series!","<p>In &quot;71009 LEGO Minifigures - The Simpsons Series 2 {Random bag}&quot; we can found a lot of interesting minifigures&nbsp;and parts. But we have also a small chance to get Homer...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The head is the same as in the first series.&nbsp;The legs are not printed. Torso looks poorly. Accessory is nothing special.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Designers took care of the smallest details of most characters in this series. But not about the Homer.&nbsp;They probably thought that: &quot;This is the main character. Fans will buy it even will be poor and low-budget.&quot;&nbsp;I absolutely do not recommend.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Usual minifigure series packaging, including a nicely designed collector&#39;s sheet</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice reuse of the Homer Simpson head previously available on the series 1 Homer. New torso print for the suit/jacket and pink (why pink?) tie. Relatively uncommon leg colouration.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>While this is the third version of homer, it is a worthy addition to the line-up. This is a great version of the character and unlike the previous two versions in Series 1 and the House is not wearing the usual white shirt. He is instead wearing his suit which he wears occasionally throughout the series, especially when going to church.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Standard construction</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A nice, cheaply priced minifigure who is well done and looks the part (apart from the pink tie).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Highly recommended</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-06-29T16:31:05.503Z","Date Night Homer","<p><strong>Set #71009 Homer Simpson:</strong> The Simpsons Series 2 included all five Simpsons yet again, which makes sense, and while some got decent alternate costumes unfortunately Homer suffers from having little alternative wardrobes to choose from.</p>

<p>This version of Homer shares everything with the previous version except for the torso and the accessories. He dresses up to take Marge on a date, or go to Church, and this torso is a simple print with a dark blue suit, Homer&#39;s traditional white shirt underneath and matching light purple tie. His accessory is a printed tile of a box of chocolates in a heart shaped box, for Valentine&#39;s Day. (Or For Homer, you decide.)</p>

<p>Honestly I&#39;m not a fan of reusing characters when Springfield has tons of characters to choose from, if a Series 3 comes out next year it&#39;d be nice to see all 16 unique with no repeats. As Disney has taken off with a huge following I&#39;m afraid we might see the Simpsons fade into LEGO obscurity. So get them while you can. Slightly recommended for variant collectors and completists.</p>

"sideswinger","2023-01-25T15:39:37.363Z","NOT recommended!","<p>My house is currently covered in several inches of snow, so since I&#39;m indoors, let&#39;s review the LEGO Minifigures Simpsons Series 2! This series released in May of 2015, and retailed for $3.99 in US dollars.</p>

<p>The first character found within the series is fittingly Homer Simpson, only now he appears in his Sunday Best. I suppose it&#39;s a decent outfit, if the designers wanted to include Homer, but I think ge could&#39;ve benefited from a different, more unique design. The head piece here is the exact same part to be found in the first Simpsons series, with no new prints or anything. This does offer a nice alternative to acquiring that piece, however, if you happened to miss out o the first set of 16. I love the use of moulded heads on these characters, though that was an unpopular opinion to have back in 2011.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t love anything on this figure, and I think I&#39;d say the same thing, even if I were a Simpsons fan (I am not,). The torso here is somewhat useful outside of the setting, and it is interesting to get a suit in that blue colour, but it is in no way accurate to the suit Homer wears in the show. The show basically depicts it as being grey, and this bright blue tone certainly doesn&#39;t work here. I think sand blue would&#39;ve worked so much better. Oh, and why is his tie bright pink? Homer&#39;s tie is normally represented with dark grey in the show, so this seems inaccurate. He lacks back printing.</p>

<p>The legs appear equally disappointing in that they not only lack detail, but they&#39;re also the complete wrong colour, and totally mismatched from the torso.</p>

<p>I wish I could say the accessory saves the figure, but I&#39;d be lying, because his chocolate box is my least favourite thing here. Printing a 3-dimensional shape onto a 2x2 tile just does NOT work for me, and it definitely looks cheap and weak.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m not a Simpsons fan, but if I were, I still wouldn&#39;t like this figure. It doesn&#39;t use a unique head, the prints are weak, inaccurate, and mismatched, and is accessory is super cheap. Overall, unless you&#39;re a hard core collector or a hard core Simpsons fan, I definitely do not recommend this. 2 out of 5.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I&#39;ll be posting more Simpsons Series 2 reviews soon!</p>
