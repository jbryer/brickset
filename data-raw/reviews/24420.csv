<p>Smithers has&nbsp;no printing on the legs and a relatively plain torso print with a suit jacket in a dull olive tone a white undershirt and a purple bowtie. His head sculpt captures his look quite nicely and he looks pretty good. His accessory is two tiles, a 1x4 tile with studs and a 1x4 printed tile to attach to it. The print is hilarious for what it is, Malibu Stacy, with a New Hat! Such an awesomely fun nod to one of my favorite episodes.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend tracking him down if you missed him back when this Series was released. He&#39;s a great looking character and will compliment Mr. Burns quite nicely from Series 1. Plus he comes with a great looking accessory.</p>
