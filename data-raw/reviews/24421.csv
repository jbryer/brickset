"Dalekbuster523","2015-05-16T23:45:10.52Z","Even a baby can build this set.","<p>Maggie isn&#39;t really the ideal LEGO minifigure. Yeah, she may be the youngest member of the Simpsons family and she may have shot Mr Burns but beyond that, why would anyone want a Maggie minifigure? She&#39;s possibly the most disposable character out of any of the Simpsons family. It was with that view in mind that I was disappointed to receive Maggie in my blind bag (I thought I felt Bart&#39;s slingshot, not Santa&#39;s Little Helper).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packet comes with no instructions, which is fine because this is a incredibly straightforward build. As usual, you get a handy checklist to keep track of your LEGO Simpsons minifigure collection. My only issue with the packaging is the stupid blind bag idea.</p>

<p>Everybody who collects these will be after specific minifigures. In what reality, therefore, does it make sense to make these blind bag? It&#39;s very frustrating, especially when it costs &pound;2.40 per bag.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are really not many parts to this. There&#39;s a head, body and torso and that&#39;s it. Santa&#39;s Little Helper isn&#39;t even made of parts; you don&#39;t have to build him, he is already in full form. I would have liked to have seen a 4*4 tile given the cost of a blind bag.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Maggie herself looks nice and looks exactly as she does in the TV show, which is all you can ask for. Santa&#39;s Little Helper also looks great, although it is strange he&#39;s bundled with Maggie and not Bart given how he is Bart&#39;s dog in the show.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is far too easy. All you have to do is literally put Maggie&#39;s head and torso together. I&#39;d like to have seen more of a challenge.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Maggie is possibly LEGO&#39;s weakest minifigure, although she still nicely resembles the character&#39;s look in The Simpsons. Still, at least you get Santa&#39;s Little Helper in this blind bag to make up for the simplistic build.</p>

<p>Santa&#39;s Little Helper: This new piece is an excellent animal design, it captures the look of the family pet from The Simpsons quite nicely with large buggy looking eyes and a nice lean sculpt. The only problem it has is attaching to studs very reliably, probably due to how skinny the legs are and where the stud connectors are located.</p>

<p>Overall if you&#39;re looking for the dog at this point grabbing it off Bricklink is definitely worth going for. As far as Minifigures go, since Maggie never changes her wardrobe re-releasing her is a bit of a problem and takes up a slot that could have been more useful for other characters. I&#39;d recommend this if you don&#39;t already own a Maggie, or if you&#39;re a 100% Simpsons Minifigure collector and want every single version, otherwise it&#39;s pretty safe to skip her and hunt down Santa&#39;s Little Helper by itself.</p>

<p>Maggie Simpson , while being out of proportion with the other Minifigures , is a fun but not exclusive one who is surprisingly paired up with Santa&#39;s little helper .</p>

<p>Minifigure -</p>

<p>She has a head mould used for the other renditions of her character in Lego which has printing and a very interesting torso leg combo in a very light blue which works well .</p>

<p>Accessories -</p>

<p>Her only accessory is a very very good Santa&#39;s little helper with not much printing but is enough and is probably the most accurate Lego mould . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good CMF but it is a shame that Santa&#39;s little helper is the only exclusive part as the figure came in the 2014 Simpsons house but doesn&#39;t Bart make more sense to be paired up with Santa&#39;s little helper other than Maggie , but any Lego Simpsons can will get it for Santa&#39;s little helper so I recommend it .</p>

"sideswinger","2023-03-10T16:42:17.2Z","Weak choice!","<p>The Simpsons Series 2 is full of new characters that were never previously seen in LEGO. However, upon release, Maggie Simpson was not super fresh, since we previously got her in the original Simpsons Series, as well as in 71006. But this figure gets its validation from it&#39;s accessory, that being Santa&#39;s Little Helper. This figure includes a whopping 3 pieces, and retailed for 4 dollars, where she was released in 2015.</p>

<p>Maggie Simpson does use an exclusive facial expression. All previous uses of this head sculpt included a drowsy-eye design, while this variation has them wide open. This sculpt is fantastic with every use, and the printed bow and inky are adorable.</p>

<p>The torso piece was a completely new mould made exclusively for Maggie Simpson in 71006 The Simpsons House, and it was later reused in the first Simpsons CMF series. Its use here is not exclusive whatsoever, which is definitely disappointing. I wish some sort of new printing would have been applied, since this theme is centred around the minifigures themselves, not the accessories.</p>

<p>With that being said, a fantastic accessory is certainly welcome, and I can&#39;t think of a better inclusion than the family dog, Santa&#39;s Little Helper. I&#39;ve never seen the show, but I have&nbsp;seen enough source material to appreciate this accuracy. Santa&#39;s Little Helper uses an entirely new mould, with printing on the eyes and nose. It looks fantastic!</p>

<p>Overall, while the inclusion of Maggie is kind of weak, I appreciate the exclusive head print. Obviously, the show-stealer is Santa&#39;s Little Helper, which is admittedly, pretty incredible. But this theme is called &quot;Minifigures&quot;, not &quot;Accessories.&quot; With that being said, I&#39;m giving this a 3 out of 5, thanks to the new dog mould.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all for my&nbsp;review, thanks for reading!</p>
