<p>With a dual molded armed torso in a nice light pink color with purple collar and belt/sash printing and dual molded short legs with a matching pink color and yellow showing her legs Lisa has everything going for her when it comes to unique torso parts. The cloth skirt is pink and looks a bit raggedy/tattered around the edges, but this is mostly due to the nature of these cloth pieces and the short legs. Also her dress design from the show.</p>

<p>Snowball II/III/IV is a wonderfully delightful looking new animal piece with a unique design due to the animation esthetics of the show. It&#39;s so unique to the show I&#39;m afraid we won&#39;t be seeing it again from LEGO unless we got more Simpsons sets, so collect them now if you want more for your MOCs. Overall this figure is great and I highly recommend it.</p>

But in my quest to review every LEGO CMF ever, the Simpsons Series 2 had to be included, bringing me to the third character of the series. Lisa Simpson. She includes 5 pieces, retailed for 4 US dollars, and released in May 2015.</p>

<p>Atop the figure is an exclusive head piece. It is not a new mould, but rather, a new reprint. The eyes are identical to Lisa&#39;s Simpsons Series 1 counterpart, but the small, pink bow is an exclusive addition. As always, the moulding surrounding the head is superb.</p>

<p>Lisa&#39;s torso is exclusive, and the combination of light pink and purple looks appealing. The dual-moulded pink and yellow arms are what get my attention, however, since they&#39;re usable outside the setting. She has no back printing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to see a cloth skirt used here. It certainly gives her some depth. Underneath that skirt, though they are hard to see, are some tri-moulded legs, which are always brilliant to see! This time they&#39;re coloured in light pink and yellow.</p>

<p>My favourite part of this figure is no-doubt the inclusion of Snowball. I&#39;ve never seen the show, but I can still say with honesty that I adore this sculpt. It&#39;s so ridiculous and stupid that it&#39;s hard not to love. The massive green eyes, pink nose, and sharp teeth are printed rather than dual-moulded, as is the red collar around the neck. Obviously, it was an entirely new sculpt made for the figure.</p>

<p>Overall, I&#39;m not a Simpsons fan, but I will say, the inclusion of Lisa in this particular outfit is extremely welcome! It&#39;s an iconic design that seems to be prominent in the show, so I appreciate that. But the selling point for Lisa is obviously Snowball, which is executed masterfully! And at the end of the day, I don&#39;t mind that this isn&#39;t a new character since she&#39;s taken in a direction that makes her feel fresh and unique. 4 out of 5!</p>
