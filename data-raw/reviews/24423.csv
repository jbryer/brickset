I&#39;m not saying this is a bad thing, I&#39;m just saying it was a surprise.</p>

<p>Professor Frink has his nicely sculpted head which captures the look of his animation model quite nicely, with the badly done hair style, the big nose, his bucked teeth and his science goggles... I mean glasses... how does he see through those things when you can&#39;t even see his eyes behind them? Heh.</p>

<p>His torso includes a single sided print with a lab coat over a white button up shirt and blue bowtie. His legs are cast in pink with the lab coat printed over his hips showing how long it is. And for accessories, some concoction, a green beaker full of perhaps delicious lime juice... Or a deadly chemical that could destroy us all! You never can tell with the good Professor. I&#39;d say he&#39;s a pretty good looking character and overall I&#39;d recommend him if you haven&#39;t gotten him yet, I just wish he&#39;d come with a better character specific accessory, the beaker is kind of common place these days and I don&#39;t recall Professor Frink mixing chemicals too often in the show. Mostly it was wacky inventions.</p>
