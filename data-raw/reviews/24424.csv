<p>Martin Prince is one of those characters many fans enjoy and his LEGO version captures that likeness quite well. With a short sleeved white shirt, including a pocket with pens and dual molded arms, he has short legs with orange shorts and shoes, dual molded of course not printed. And he comes with a large book, larger than he is tall almost titled Coping with a High IQ.</p>

<p>Overall Martin&#39;s one of the better offerings from this series, if only because it&#39;s nice to get so many Children to populate Springfield, although at this point we&#39;ve only got Bart, Lisa, Milhouse, Martin, Ralph and Nelson, but still it&#39;s nice to see so many short legged characters with new short legs for MOM builders. Definitely recommend picking this puppy up.</p>
