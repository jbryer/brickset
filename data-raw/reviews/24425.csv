<p>Selma&nbsp;has a nicely detailed blue torso with dress printing, wearing red pearls around her neck. her legs have a matching waist, but are otherwise standard LEGO Yellow. Because once again you have the cloth skirt piece to wrap around the minfiigures legs. Her head sculpt is quite massive due to the Bouvier hair, she and her sisters have outrageously large hair styles and this sculpt captures that look quite nicely. Even her expression is one of utter boredom. Making the cynical Selma a dangerous one to cross.</p>

<p>The printed eye chart tile is a nicely done piece and works as a great accessory for MOC fans who enjoy making Eye Doctors&#39; offices and stuff for their LEGO City displays. It&#39;s a very useful part. Overall&nbsp;Selma is a decent looking Minifigure and is one I can recommend for fans of the Simpsons. Younger collectors might not care much for the character, and certain parents may not approve of this one due to the fact that she and her sister are portrayed notoriously as chain smokers. Still recommended though.</p>
