However she&#39;s got a different hair style and coloring for her dress.</p>

<p>Patty&#39;s dress is pink, she&#39;s wearing blue pearls and matching earrings sculpted onto her head. Her arms however are double molded, with upper pink arms and standard yellow, which makes for a nice use of parts and a re-use opportunity for her dress on other LEGO minifigures. Her legs are wrapped by a pink cloth dress piece and for an accessory she&#39;s got the LEGO Friends purse in blue. (If I&#39;m not mistaken, I think it&#39;s just the Friends purse reused, but it could be a new sculpted piece. Please forgive me if I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t own many Friends sets with this piece yet.)</p>

<p>Overall, much like her sister I recommend her for the great use of parts and for fans of the series. There are some who may not care for her character due to how she and her sister are portrayed on the show and that&#39;s their prerogative. Recommended.</p>
