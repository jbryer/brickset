<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Simple polybag with a sleek design matching its cardboard enclosed bigger siblings. Standard two-sided instruction sheet typical in polybags of this size. The smaller bits of this set were enclosed in their own clear bag inside which I had not seen before in a polybag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Highlights include a printed 1x4 yellow tile with the diagonal black caution stripes. Also a 2x2 printed white tile of the Jurassic World logo is most welcome. A short metallic silver chain and a pair of black elephant trunk ends rounds out the part highlights.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Not a minifigure but the Gallimimus dinosaur is the clearly the highlight of the set. Colored in lime green with dark red markings it is a striking figure.Teeth have been colored white and the eyes are printed yellow. There is a single stud attachment point on his back and the forward positioned right foot fits securely onto a stud. However the back foot does not hold a stud, perhaps to allow for flexibility. The hands are able to hold onto round bar objects but not quite as strong or well as a typical clip. A bar will also slide horizontally into the gap in the teeth of the dino.The Gallimimus is molded out of hard rubber with the stud on the back still being ABS plastic.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There is not much to say about a build with 29 pieces but it is enjoyable for what it is.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is small but has a nice mechanism for luring the dinosaur with the chicken leg and then the trap drops around his neck. Presumably the trans blue parts deliver an electric shock to stun the creature.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is an absolutely excellent polybag and well worth the price of admission just for the dinosaur which makes its only appearance here. The trap is not to be overlooked as it gives great playability for so small a set. A few nice printed parts and unique design that breaks away from the typical polybag fare make this poly just about perfect.</p>

"chrisbstm","2015-06-15T08:25:02.98Z","Everything you'd want in a polybag!","<p>I received this polybag thru preordering Lego Jurassic World initially, and discovered they were also for general sale at TRU</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just a polybag. The design and colors are definitely eye catching, the instructions are your typical poly instructions, single sheet printed on both sides. I didn&#39;t find them hard to follow, and I don&#39;t believe the target audience will either.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Excellent,excellence selection of parts. The printed JP logo tile, and printed hazard tile stand out the most to me, but the other parts included are good MOC material. Oh yeah, never enough turkey legs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I&#39;m gonna&nbsp;go ahead and count the dinosaur as the minifig&nbsp;for this one. At first I was disappointed it was a softer plastic instead of the regular ABS, but it&#39;s grown on me (and a harder plastic could probably injure a kid). The printing is bright and on point, and the colors are perfect IMO. Maybe less aggressive eyes, but hey, it&#39;s a dinosaur.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Over pretty quickly. Maybe 2-3 minutes. Nothing too complicated.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Pretty cool. The function works pretty well, and it will fit in perfectly with the other dinosaur themed sets lego has produced throughout the years.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I think this is an excellent polybag. I got my first one through a preorder, but when I found out they were for sale at TRU, I picked up a few more for more dinos&nbsp;and gifts for the nieces. IMO this is one of the better polybags&nbsp;to come out recently. Cool little build, a dinosaur, and two thumbs up from me.</p>

"mr_piggle","2015-06-30T18:28:36.687Z","Snared My Affection!","<p>I received this polybag as a pre-order bonus of the Jurassic World video game, which was a sweet surprise. Though I do hear that this polybag is available in the US at Toys&#39;R&#39;Us, I have not visited any locations to see if this is true. However, I will state that if I were to see this set &quot;in the wild&quot; for sale, I would definitely impulse buy a few, and not just because I&#39;m really into dinosaurs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obviously this set is a polybag, so there&#39;s no box, but instead the appropriately-sized plastic bag. I still love the overall design of the Jurassic World theme, the blue and red scales are really pleasing to the eye on all of the packaging. The illustration on the front of the bag obviously clearly shows what&#39;s inside, and it looks preeeetty cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are standard polybag instructions, one sheet folded into the very slight finished&nbsp;size of one of those restaurant hand wipe cloths. Always fun to unfold to see how much can be put on one page. The instructions are very clear, and definitely easy enough for even young fans to follow along with.</p>

<p>The parts are pretty neat. My disclaimer is always that I&#39;m not a rare parts connoisseur, so I really don&#39;t care much about collecting bits and bobs that are really hard to find. I will say, though, that the pieces included in this set were a nice surprise and a pretty clever assemblage. &nbsp;There are no minifigures in the most strict sense of the word, but there is the titular &quot;Gallimimus&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to be slightly picky for a moment and state the obvious: the included dinosaur is in no way a Gallimimus, because those suckers had no teeth and the lime green bundle of awesome included in this set has a nice set of super-sharp looking choppers. Checking the dinosaur exhibit listings on the official Jurassic World website, clearly shows&nbsp;the difference.&nbsp;Does it really affect anything? Not really. The dinosaur is still awesome, and perhaps even more awesome for NOT being a Gallimimus. It&#39;s obviously more fun to trap a chicken leg chomping carnivore, than a fruit-gumming omnivore.</p>

<p>That aside, the &quot;Gallimimus&quot; is awesome. &nbsp;It looks tough and sleek, and the coloring is really eye&nbsp;catching. The fact that it&#39;s softer rubber was initially a little bit off-putting, as was the fact that it was one molded figure and could not be assembled in any way. But despite those things, it feels pretty nice in the hands, and the softer rubber and inability to be assembled is probably good for any tiny chewers who might happen upon it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it, the dinosaur is the star of this 29 piece set, however the trap itself is not to be overlooked. It&#39;s simple but fun to put together. The printed pieces are really nice to have. The entire thing feels like something that has good value both as a building experience and a plaything, as I can easily see children trapping or attempting to trap many different types of critters with this item while playing. Is it earth shatteringly amazing? No, but for what it is, it&#39;s really good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this polybag would be worth shelling out the standard in-store polybag price, and I would have cheerfully done so even if I did not receive it as a pre-order bonus. Personally, I find that despite the set having a very small amount of pieces, the set is pretty impressive, and fun!</p>
