Just to let everyone know, this issue may come with an extra figure, I saw it with Ewar (I think, it may have been Vornon)&nbsp;as well as Lundor in WH Smith in Reading but when I actually got a copy today it came with a Crug minifigure. The contents page only details Lundor as the &#39;free gift&#39; this month...</p>

<p>You get the usual shebang to make minifigures, they come with their accessories as pictured on their foil bags but for the &pound;4.99 price it isn&#39;t really a bargain buy.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if anyone knows why the figures have what seem to be moulded removable &#39;animal masks&#39; as well as double printed faces on their actual &#39;heads&#39; that go underneath the &#39;animal masks&#39; please explain as I wonder if these figures are supposed to be wearing &#39;masks&#39; or the &#39;mask&#39; is their &#39;actual&#39; face...?</p>
