"ggfile","2015-10-08T09:47:12.42Z","a review of the game play elements of Lego Dimensions.","<p>I am not a huge gamer. I do own a PS3, and I play about 3 - 8 hours per week. Sometimes more, but usually I am so busy I do not have time to play video games. As an AFOL, and a BTTF fan, I realized the moment this game was announced that it was a &quot;must have&quot; for me.</p>

<p>On the day that the game came out, I happened to be heading to Vancouver for a week on business, so I picked up my game that I had pre ordered from EB Games, placed it in with the rest of my video games, leaving the entire package unopened for an entire week while I was away. I did not have enough $ to pick up the BTTF level pack, so I just picked up the game and left add-ons to the wish list. Of course as soon as I had got home, I rushed&nbsp;to the TV and opened the box! Inside was a crumpled up instruction book for the game portal, a neatly folded poster, and 3 bags numbered #1, #2 &amp; #3. I opened the first bag and quickly built the minifigures that were inside. Bag #2 was the portal. I built the portal, then noticed that there were no instructions for bag #3, which was the bat mobile. I left bag #3 alone.</p>

<p>I turned on the game and the game started with a long introduction and a story line of Batman, Gandolf and Wildstyle being zapped out of their &quot;world&quot; and onto a planet called Vorton. After a few minutes of gameplay, I came across the instructions for the portal in the game itself. As I had already built the portal, I just skipped passed these instructions. After that, I was unable to figure out what to do or what was next. I spent a whole hour trying eve ry character shooting at every thing and driving the car but nothing was unlocking whatever was next. I then went online, found a walkthrough on Youtube for the level and it was here that I discovered that all I had to do at this point in the game was to become Batman and that in fact what I was experiencing was a glitch (the next point in the game just happened to be the instructions for the bat mobile). I gave up and restarted the game only to come across the same glitch again. Wondering if I perhaps needed to be online to download the bat mobile instructions, I turned on the internet - only to have a message come up saying &quot;an update has been found for this game. Would you like to download it now? - All unsaved progress will be lost&quot;. I said yes. The update was the patch code to the problem that I had and presumably others, as the file was over 2 Gigs and took an hour and a half to download. I then restarted the game (attempt #3 now) from the beginning and low and behold, as soon as I became Batman, the instructions for the bat mobile appeared. Once everything had been physically built, there were a handful of small pieces left over.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I did a little bit of in game experimenting. I played the game with just the function circle bricks and no minifigures bat mobile or even the portal itself - for an entire level. Yes the game works without all these things so if you are a true MOCer you can literally just pick out the function circle bricks and put the other 262 pieces with the rest of your spare pieces if you wish. The same is not true in reverse. I have homer Simpson from The Simpsons Minifigure Series #1 &amp; 2, but I cannot use these in the game as I do not have a Function Circle Brick for Homer Simpson. This means that if I want to use Homer Simpson in the game, I need to buy the Simpsons Level Pack for the game. and get a third homer simpson minifigure.<br />
<br />
I have now played through a few levels. I have come acr oss yet another glitch in the second level, Attack of the Micromanagers, but I did not encounter the glitch playing the level a second time. I have since encountered even more glitches,&nbsp;causing me to have to restart from my last save point. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a number of LEGO games for my PS3 and this one is already my favorite. It is also by far the most expensive one out there. The entire story line can be played with just the starter pack and nothing more, but in order to do every thing in the game, it appears that you would have to purchase every add on pack that has been announced to date. Once you start adding on bonus packs and characters to unlock things, the price tag can easily be in the hundreds of dollars. And if you are an elitist and you just must get 100% completion, I would not be surprised if it would cost you over $1000. All in all, unless you are a hardcore gamer. my suggestion is to simply get the packs that pique your interests, the starter pack, The wicked witch from the Wizard of Oz (she unlocks a lot of in game elements) - and nothing more.<br />
<br />
If you are into video games, then make sure this game is part of your collection. As for myself, in a few weeks, I will be picking up the Back to the Future Level Pack for the game. Happy playing :)</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box/Instructions</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

What&rsquo;s really impressive is the image on the front with Batman, Gandalf and Wildstyle leaping around the Dimensional portals.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The box for the toy pad is a plain white and includes a slot for the game disc case. The bricks come in their own box which is a smaller version of the larger box graphically speaking, but missing the system specific logos. On the back you also get a full wave breakdown for releases in a checklist and a shot of each type of pack for Series 1, it&rsquo;s all fairly simple, but still exciting looking.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: Most of the instructions can be found in-game, or on LEGO&rsquo;s personal site in order to build elements that are not shown how to build in the physical instruction manuals. Therefore I am going to comment on the manuals here, with the Starter Pack you&rsquo;ll find three numbered bags, two of which are included in the manual for easy build of the characters and the Gateway. For the rest you&rsquo;ll have to go online. Thus these manuals are all very simple, straight forward and rather thin.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Starter Pack is the only one to include stickers for detailing found primarily on the Gateway. Like with all LEGO manuals you will find a parts breakdown in the back.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

Other interesting parts include the unique printed Keystones, the three robot arms for X-PO and one part of the Gateway to hold a Keystone in the back. And the RIF tags for Batman, Gandalf, Wildstyle and the one reserved for the Batmobile.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Overall due to the price of the Starter Pack I can&rsquo;t recommend this for a parts pack, but it does come with some nice parts for reuse if you were so inclined.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Batman: Using the old cowl piece and a newer torso print this version of Batman is unique to the Starter Pack for LEGO Dimensions. His accessories include Batarangs and he&rsquo;s pretty much typical of other Batman minfigs for the printing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Gandalf: Not much to discuss about Gandalf here, he&rsquo;s the same you&rsquo;ve come to expect from the LotR and Hobbit Themes. He includes his beard, staff and hat and the printing is identical to what we&rsquo;ve seen before.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Wildstyle: Once again she&rsquo;s the same as what we&rsquo;ve come to expect from the Wildstyle character, her printing is identical to past offerings of her character. Her biggest claim to fame is the new Scanner device which uses a few pieces to build, including the new printed piece for her scanner. She&rsquo;s the most unique mostly due to this accessory element.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: Three Minifigures doesn&rsquo;t amount to much of a build to discuss, so let&rsquo;s move on to the next phase.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: This section of the build is the most prevalent, first you&rsquo;ll build up the bottom of the Gateway and then move on to the more repetitive, but no less interesting build steps for creating the circular Gateway which is used in-game to travel through the Dimensions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 3: You&rsquo;ll find all the parts here to build the Batmobile, the instructions of which are unlocked for the first time in-game. This mirco scaled vehicle is pretty impressively designed and I found the build rather intriguing. Two alternative builds are included once unlocking the Bat Blaster, which is an alternative model that unlocks new abilities for solving puzzles in-game and which uses all of the existing parts, and the final build is the Sonic Batray.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Once again you&rsquo;ll use all the existing pieces and construct a third bat-themed vehicle for more in-game puzzle solving.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The physical aspects of Toys To Life is where all the real fun can be had, and with LEGO Dimensions you won&rsquo;t be disappointed. The Gateway model is very impressive and looks exactly like the in-game model, the Batmobile, Batblaster and Batray vehicle builds are very cleverly designed for a 3-in-1 micro scaled model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I prefer the Batmobile personally, however the Batblaster has its good points, including the fact that it looks like a vehicle Batman would have in his arsenal. The Batray is a bit of a weaker model due to the nature of the design, which includes an odd armature with the sonic weapon attached to it. I don&rsquo;t like it all that well, however others might enjoy it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The entire point of the physical aspects however is to complement the game and the gameplay itself, Traveler&rsquo;s Tales and LEGO as well as the other numerous Partners involved with this title should be very pleased. The Game has many hidden tricks and secrets to discover with a vast universe of Adventure Worlds and Levels to explore with a large cast of characters. Not as many as you&rsquo;d find inside other LEGO Games due to the nature of Toys-to-Life. I suspect however, due to the staying power of LEGO this game could wind up featuring more than 200 playable characters once its life has played out.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I&rsquo;ll discuss more of the gaming aspects of this title throughout the reviews of the numerous packs, for now I leave off with this to say. The Starter Pack allows you to play through an extensive story through 13-14 main game levels, you can accomplish everything for the main story here and will only require other characters to explore further and 100% everything in the game, from collecting Gold Bricks, Mini-Kits and other fun elements.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is difficult to quantify honestly, however I&rsquo;ll summarize it as best as I can. LEGO Dimensions is a huge investment, if you want to experience everything the game has to offer you will need to be prepared to go for every unique character that will unlock another IP Franchise. You will also need to be prepared to do a lot of building while playing the game, because of the fun that it offers to build the model after placing a character on the toypad.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The difference between LEGO Dimensions and other similar products is the use of actual LEGO for building of Minifigures and Models that represent in-game equivalents. It also touts itself as being a one Toypad game, you won&rsquo;t need to buy any upgrades or other discs, everything is included with this Starter Pack. You can get it and only a handful of packs to explore everything that interests you, or you can go 100% completionist and collect everything. It&rsquo;s going to be an expensive investment, but well worth it in my opinion. I strongly recommend picking this up as a fan of LEGO, and LEGO Video Games. It&rsquo;s also a really impressive TTL style game.</span></span></span></span></p>
