I was so excited to rip the wrapping paper and start playing. The entire build only took around 10 minutes. Its lots of fun to see your favorite characters interact with different worlds. The gameplay is easy but the downside is that you can&#39;t sit on the couch or wherever you like. You have to sit by the portal because you constantly have to move around characters to complete tasks. That can get pretty annoying at times. Lego Dimensions takes every thing you love about every lego game and then adds a ton of things that make you love lego even more. If you don&#39;t buy any packs for it then you probably won&#39;t enjoy it as much. Also it would be a lot more fun if there were more brands such as star wars or marvel, but that is unlikely since no disney owned properties will be on the game.....for now. Overall I love this game and anyone who loves legos as much as me(and I really love legos) should get the Lego Dimensions Starter Pack. :)</p>

A couple pro&#39;s about it is it is fun, you can buy different&nbsp;level packs, and just go to different land. But the only con is that if you don&#39;t play it long enough you lose all your progress. Play on!</p>
