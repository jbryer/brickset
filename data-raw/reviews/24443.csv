Or destined to leave a void in your wallet?","<p>While expressing interest in the game, I never expected to get it, due to the high price of everything involved. When I got it as a present, I was surprised, and went to play it almost immediately.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is nice, and works to show off the game nicely. The Toy Pad is packed in its own smaller box, and the parts and instructions are separate.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some surprisingly good parts in this set. Lots of Medium Azure used for the Gateway, and the printed keystones are also nice. The three determined NFC bases are nicely decorated to reflect their characters.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None of the minifigures here are new, but they&#39;re nice. Gandalf has been seen time and time again. Batman is a bizarre hybrid, using his New 52 body but his older head, and Wyldstyle is the variant found in the final wave of&nbsp;<em>The LEGO Movie</em>&#39;s sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The main build is the Gateway, which in-game takes Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle through all of the different dimensions in the story mode. It is built on a new baseplate with a circular hole for the central space on the Toy Pad. The build isn&#39;t very complex, but it uses some nice details and techniques to give the gateway a magical yet mechanical feel. Later in the game, a few extra details from the gateway can be removed and rebuilt into X-PO, the helpful &quot;mission control&quot; of the game. The purple shield keystones are all hidden behind the model and moved to the front clips around the portal as the story progresses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only other build in the Starter Pack is the &quot;Toy Tag&quot; for the Batmobile, which is a nice little minibuild. Instructions are available in-game, not on paper. Upgrades for the model&#39;s abilities and instructions for upgraded &quot;rebuilds&quot; and their own upgrades &nbsp;can be purchased upon collecting enough studs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks nice, and serves its purpose of decorating the Toy Pad. There aren&#39;t any play features besides adding keystones to the front after the first few levels, but there don&#39;t need to be as the build is just a supplement to the in-game functionality provided by the Toy Pad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The game</h3>

<p>The game is very similar in gameplay style to the other TT LEGO games, with similar puzzles. However, the big differences are that vehicles are used in some puzzles, characters must be purchased from stores, not unlocked in-game, and that the Toy Pad is essential to puzzles activated by the keystones. All of these puzzles (and a few additional gameplay mechanics) involve moving characters between the panels on the Toy Pad to accomplish a task. This also allows you to remove or add characters and vehicles at any given time, in true toys-to-life fashion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The story of the game is fun, with an original villain causing the different dimensions to collide, with his goal being to collect unique items from each world to gain control of all of them. The writing takes advantage of any silly opportunity or meta-joke and reference, which is always entertaining, and it was fun to see which elements from different worlds would cross over in each level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Batman plays similarly to the way he has in previous TT games, with his abilities being to activate boomerang switches, pull at grappling hooks, and turn invisible to bypass security cameras.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wyldstyle has a new ability since her last videogame appearance, which is to find hidden objects with her relic scanner in areas with glowing pink particles in the air. Besides that, she can use acrobatic objects (patterned after her hair and graffiti colors) and master build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gandalf has magical abilities, with the ability to levitate sparkling blue objects and illuminate dark areas. He also has a magical forcefield which is somewhat useful in battle, but needs to be maintained by holding the button.&nbsp;</p>

<p>None of the included characters have exclusive abilities, but they are the bare minimum with which you can complete the game&#39;s story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the big problem with the game is that completion requires money, and no small amount of it. While you can choose which characters you choose to purchase, it will be necessary to access each open world, each additional level, and have enough characters to solve every kind of puzzle in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really enjoy the game and its gameplay, but the requirement for more characters is a problem. If you&#39;re willing to commit, though, I&#39;d recommend it. You&#39;re in for a fun experience.</p>

<p>Within the box you receive the Wii U copy of the game as well as 2 bags of parts, the main pad for the portal, and the chord attached to the pad. It is overall a very pleasant&nbsp;unboxing, a combination of receiving a brand new game as well as opening a crisp, new LEGO set. There are also the instructions for building the portal, minifigures, and the batmobile along with a brick separator.</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>It is overall an enjoyable building experience, but not as rewarding because for most of the time you are building the portal, you are more exited for playing the game than the display of the build afterwards. It does look quite nice on display, however, especially when it is plugged in and the pad is lit up, constantly cycling through colors. This is especially enjoyable to view in a dark environment, lighting up the actual portal build and making it look real. The batmobile is also quite nice looking and even is better than some mini builds of the batmobile in polybags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>All minifigures are fantastic, and yet none are exclusive. That&#39;s the true beauty of this all. It doesn&#39;t take some rare and exclusive, super detailed figures to make this an enjoyable game. It&#39;s the same figures that we play with regularly, simple and classic,&nbsp;brought to life in a game. It is also a combination of a dark hero, a light sorcerer, and a wild warrior; what better way to express the crazy and unimaginable possibilities and combinations with LEGO?</p>

<p>Game:</p>

<p>The game is great, a story of all realms and dimensions of LEGO being clashed together and them all having to find a way to get back to their own worlds. It should be noted that this is the only material that you have to purchase to walkthrough the whole game and other packs only are necessary if you wish to do a 100% completion walkthrough of the game. However, if you do want the full gaming experience, you will need to buy much more than just this as this pack doesn&#39;t give any access to incredible adventure worlds such as Portal 2, Simpsons, Harry Potter, Teen Titans, Ghostbusters, Mission Impossible, and more. Just judging the core game however, the levels are all in depth and fun, resembling other LEGO games but with many more possibilities.</p>

<p>Overall:&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is true that this pack will really not give you a good enough idea of all the game is truly capable of. However, it does open such a world for you, and being the starter pack, it provides a great game, fun builds and figures, and begins you on a journey that can last many dozens of hours of entertainment. I would 10/10 recommend.</p>

"HandPositions","2020-05-08T16:51:47.933Z","It Feels Like Only Yesterday","<p>The LEGO Dimensions Starter Pack was released with the theme in 2015 at the price of $99.99. I purchased it two years later, when Dimensions was becoming less popular, and every product was being sold for about half price, along with two additional sets, one team pack and one level pack. This set was revolutionary for its time, as it was the first LEGO game with a purchasable character grid. All you had to do was place your desired character onto the toy pad, and he or she (or it) would appear on screen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure selection is great for this set. With Gandalf, Batman, and Wyldstyle, you have every character necessary to complete the story mode of the game. Each minifigure was the newest rendition, with the newer face on Wyldstyle, and the grey Batman costume. Each minifigure came on a blue circular stand with two studs on the top. Each stand has a special printing for the character on&nbsp;top and special code on the bottom that the toy pad recognized as the character. Along with the minifigures, there is a micro-scale Batmobile that the minifigures can drive in-game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gateway itself is stunning to look at. It has a beautiful colour scheme, with the transparent&nbsp;blue and navy blue contrasting nicely. It connects at two points to the toy pad itself, with a hole in the centre to fit a minifigure, vehicle, or gadget. On the portal portion of the gateway, there are five points to connect the keystones when you &ldquo;discover&rdquo; them in-game. When not in use, they can be stored at&nbsp;the back. I love the addition of the baseplate especially designed for the theme, seen in story packs for completely different levels, such as the Fantastic Beasts and Ghostbusters 2016 stories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the toy pad, there are seven spaces to place a minifigure, vehicle, or gadget. The minifigures included in the set, along with the Batmobile, can fit on the toy pad at the same time. When the game is in action, the spaces glow and make sound effects when you are activating the keystones or using special powers with the characters. I happened to buy the Harry Potter Team Pack and Ghostbusters Level Pack to go along with the set and activate levels and other parts of the story. In the game, if you do not have a certain minifigure or gadget, you can use the &ldquo;hire a hero&rdquo; function, where you use studs to activate another character from the game. This is only if you want to activate things outside the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was very sad when the game closed and sets stopped being produced. It felt like the game was incomplete. Soon after, the price of the sets was just over half of the original price. The stores were being restocked, replacing LEGO Dimensions with newer games and consoles. Not much later, the game itself began glitching. I could not play the game for fifteen minutes before it paused and deactivated. Still, the experience I had when I had it was wonderful, and I would not replace it with anything else.</p>
