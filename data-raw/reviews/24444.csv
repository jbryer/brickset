"8BrickMario","2016-01-06T14:47:20.71Z","Was it a wise purchase? Or should I go back in time and undo it?","<p>The first pack to represent&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future</em>&nbsp;in Dimensions, many were drawn to the pieces within, and the content it offered. Is it worth the hefty price?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is nice, and stands out among others in the toys-to-life aisle in stores.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some pretty nice parts here, but the big one is the hoverboard. It&#39;s a completely new mold, essentially like the regular skateboard, but without axles and one of the ends being turned up and flat. The printing on the board looks great, and it&#39;s nice that we got it here. The NFC base for Marty is decorated with the colors of his shirt and vest and a stylized BttF render of his name.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Marty McFly here is not a new figure, but he&#39;s still nice to have, as I don&#39;t own the Ideas DeLorean. He accurately represents the character, and he comes with his guitar, which, while needing some printing, is a nice addition.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was pretty easy, but some nice techniques were used for the DeLorean.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The builds here are pretty good, with the glorified stand for the hoverboard being a bit pointless for the first version of the build, but the DeLorean really stands out. It&#39;s nicely detailed and looks like the car, but the very best part is that they made the doors open just like they do on the actual car! Such a great little detail.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>I will echo the statements that the level here is a bit underwhelming. It&#39;s basically a straight retelling of the first film, with 70% of the plot removed. The whole issue of Marty altering his family history and jeopardizing his future is never touched on, with him arriving in 1955 and immediately jumping to the night where he travels back. I did like how they changed the circumstances and solution to Doc&#39;s death, but the level felt uninspired and lacking in enough content.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Marty as a character is fairly useful, with the main draw being the guitar&#39;s use for shattering glass LEGO with its noise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hoverboard is also pretty nice, with its ability to glide over gaps and eventually be upgraded to full flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest thing here is the DeLorean, with its unique ability to use time-travel treadmills to enter different time periods, similarly to the TARDIS. These treadmills appear in levels and adventure worlds, and usually lead to important collectibles.</p>

<p>The Adventure World is probably the most involved of the bunch, with the bulk of its puzzle-solving revolving around traveling between Western Hill Valley, present-day Hill Valley, and futuristic Hill Valley to unlock things between the different time periods. It&#39;s pretty fun, although the amount of time travel involved can be a bit annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While this is one of the weaker Level Packs, I think it&#39;s still a good purchase. It unlocks a fun, puzzle-filled world and an important vehicle to the game, and sometimes a short level can be nice. Maybe wait for a sale, but get it eventually.</p>

"BlueStation","2017-03-22T04:46:36.663Z","""This is heavy...""","<p>The initial appeal of Lego Dimensions for me personally was the chance to collect some unique minifigures which in some cases I couldn&#39;t get anywhere else. I stayed away from the <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/51483"">core Lego Dimensions game</a> for quite a while, choosing instead to only pick up supplementary packs if they had that collectible appeal at the right discount.</p>

<p>The Back to the Future level pack was one of the first packs I picked up, and while I didn&#39;t pay the full retail of $29.99 USD, I ponied up a little more than I otherwise would have. I missed out on the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21103-1/The-DeLorean-Time-Machine"">Delorean</a> and Dimensions was a welcome opportunity to add Marty and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71230-1/Doc-Brown"">Doc</a> to my collection (I would later MOC a DeLorean for them) - BTTF was a favorite of mine growing up.</p>

<p>When I finally did start up the proper game, this was the first level pack I attempted after finishing the main story. How does it stack up?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One of the most collectable aspects of this pack was the inclusion of <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6122461"">Marty&#39;s Hoverboard</a>, an element &amp; design never seen in LEGO before. In the game, it functions as an additional vehicle for players to use, but as part of the physical pack it adds one more reason for fans to add this to their collection as the board was not included in 21103. It&#39;s a great piece - perfect LEGO re-creation of the board from the movie, and can be held by a minifigure as well as &quot;ridden.&quot;</p>

<p>Marty is also given a guitar which is disappointingly not printed, unlike the one found in 2015&#39;s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71010-12/Monster-Rocker"">Monster Rocker</a>.</p>

<p>The remaining elements are pretty unremarkable, even extraneous in the case of the Hoverboard &quot;build.&quot; But the other parts are not the main draw of the pack.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>This Marty McFly minifigure appears to be the same version as from the DeLorean set - and it remains outstanding. It looks just like Michael J. Fox from the movie, as much as any LEGO minifigure could. The detail right on down to the half-buttoned shirt under the printed vest - it&#39;s all there. Marty has a smirk expression and a concerned expression on the two-sided head piece. Even the color of the pants is accurate.</p>

<p>Marty is given a printed toy-tag base with his name in the BTTF signature font.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>And this is where our review takes a bit of a turn. For me, this pack already had value as a way to finally add Marty to my collection, along with his hoverboard. When I finally got the game, however, I was a little disappointed in the digital results.</p>

<p>This pack exclusively gives you the Back to the Future Level content. The level covers the plot of the first film only (which is the first missed opportunity, though it&#39;s arguable that covering all three films would have exceeded the limits of the Level Pack size).</p>

<p>The stages in the level, while fun, do not feel progressive in the story of the movie. What I mean is that, for example - the Sedgewick Hotel stage in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71228-1/Ghostbusters-Level-Pack"">Ghostbusters Level Pack</a> actually feels like you are playing through that part of the story (in it&#39;s own way), tracking down and catching Slimer. Until the end of the BTTF Level Pack, the stages mostly feel like you are exploring an area that exists frozen in a moment of the movie - Marty at Doc&#39;s House in the intro; Marty escaping the barn right after going back in time, etc. And the story skips very quickly to the finale with the clock tower. This makes sense in remembering the movie - the bulk of it was abut Marty interacting with his parents - but LEGO and TT often find creative ways to repurpose or rearrange the gameplay and content to become more playable. Here, it feels lacking.</p>

<p>The final stage where you power up the clock tower does provide a bit of fun, and (if you have the right character abilities available) even has a hidden area re-creating the school dance setting. These are the fun kind of inclusions that populate most of the Level Packs and Adventure Worlds and I wish BTTF had more of them.</p>

<p>This was one of the first Level Packs released with the Dimensions game (and was heavily marketed as such), and I&#39;m concerned that it may have given some potential buyers the impression that all the Level Packs fell a bit short. I am pleased to report that is not the case in the other Level Packs I have played&nbsp; - the others have each felt like a relatively full experience. It&#39;s unfortunate that the BTTF level doesn&#39;t have a little more to it.</p>

<p>There are some other gameplay factors to discuss:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First - this pack (along with the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71230-1/Doc-Brown"">Doc fun pack</a>) can get you into the BTTF Adventure World. This open-world version of Hill Valley is MUCH more impressive, and has a creative component with time travel that allows you to explore the different versions of Hill Valley from the movies. This makes up for the lacking Level, however if you&#39;re on a budget you may be better off just getting Doc, whose Time Train vehicle build has the same time-travel ability as the DeLorean

	<ul>
		<li>One thing I wondered when the game was first advertised was if they would have some kind of time-travel ability shared between The Doctor and Marty/Doc Brown. Ultimately, that is not the direction they went (the TARDIS has its own abilities and travel device)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Second - Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd reprise their roles and lend their voices to their respective characters in the core Dimensions game, the Level Pack, and the Adventure World
	<ul>
		<li>This is a huge plus for the packs and the game, and a rarity amongst the overall Dimensions content (which features, for many properties, a mix of archive dialogue or voice actors mimicking roles. A few actors reprise, and it&#39;s very cool that Fox and Lloyd both come back)</li>
		<li>When you have both characters on the pad, they each have a custom greeting recorded specifically for each other and the game</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Third - Marty has very few in-game abilities
	<ul>
		<li>His guitar provides sonic-smash abilities for breakable glass, and the DeLorean (and its alternate builds) have several key abilities (including the time-travel &quot;treadmill&quot; for lack of a better descriptor), but Marty himself is otherwise pretty lacking</li>
		<li>Outside of the Adventure World and Level Pack, I rarely have Marty on the toy pad because of this</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The Back to the Future Level Pack comes in as a mixed-bag, overall. As a fan of BTTF, I found great value just in the Marty minifigure and hoverboard, but when I finally fired up the Level in-game, I found it coming up short.</p>

<p>The Adventure World makes up for the disappointment and the inclusion of Fox and Lloyd is a big plus for longtime fans.</p>

<p>This pack has been on some tremendous discounts lately and it might be time to give it a try if you&#39;ve been wondering how it comes in. At full retail, it doesn&#39;t earn it&#39;s value (though none of Dimensions really justifies the list RRP - toys-to-life is an investment), but at the discounts I&#39;ve been seeing, it&#39;s more than worth it.</p>

As it stands this particular set of models just failed to realize the potential they could have simply because they stuck to giving us a physical hoverboard piece and then build some stupid unimportant add-on junk that leaves a lot to be desired.</span></span></span></span></p>

There is a bonus area for the Enchantment Under the Sea Dance, but other than that a lot of the plot is handled in cut scenes and ignores several moments in the film in order to condense and shorten the experience.</span></span></span></span></p>

You solve puzzles, unlock new areas to explore by spending studs and address quests from Non-Player Characters that run the gamut of the Cast of all three films.</span></span></span></span></p>

It would score perfectly if the system could handle everything it needs to, there&rsquo;s a lot of lag in the digital worlds of LEGO Dimensions and at times things don&rsquo;t spawn properly, taking a longer time to populate the world with the characters and objects needed to solve the puzzles and succeed in the quests. This could just be the fault of the Playstation 3 and its power capabilities, though considering the size of the game file now that we&rsquo;ve received all the updates we&rsquo;re going to get it probably could be just because of that alone.</span></span></span></span></p>

This set offers some moderate digital content for the Dimensions video game, it is not the best Level Pack, but it does include some fun little models. The DeLorean Micro Build is the larger draw, the Hoverboard is just a waste of parts on LEGO&rsquo;s parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Brick_Connections","2020-11-15T14:20:30.233Z","LEGO Dimensions goes Back to the Future in an Awesome Way!!!","<p>The Back to the Future Level Pack is the first of two packs in the&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future</em>&nbsp;franchise for&nbsp;<em>LEGO Dimensions</em>. This is one of my favourite level packs, and I love the adventure world and the time travel of the both the level and the adventure world.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve always loved the Dimensions packaging, and this is just as awesome. The DeLorean Time Machine going back in time is a nice touch and a good callback to the main trope of the film.</p>

<h2>Minifigure</h2>

<h3>Marty McFly</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a Marty McFly minifigure in this pack. It&#39;s not exclusive, because the minifigure was released in 21103 The DeLorean Time Machine for LEGO Ideas in 2013, but it is still great to be able to acquire it in another set. The printing on the torso is very detailed and realistic to the source material. The hair is a generic piece. The only&nbsp;new pieces are the printed toy tag with his name and the guitar, which is a nice touch.</p>

<h2>Builds</h2>

<h3>DeLorean Time Machine</h3>

<p>The first build in this set is one of the most iconic vehicles in the 1980s, the <em>DeLorean Time Machine</em>. It&#39;s very detailed and looks perfect for the scale. The other builds,&nbsp;<em>Electric Time Machine</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Ultra Time Machine</em>, resemble the DeLoream from different points in the films. The Electric Time Machine resembles the DeLorean at the end of Back to the Future Part I in 1955 that Marty uses to get back to 1985. The Ultra Time Machine resembles the DeLorean at the beginning of Part II where the DeLorean can now fly. Great Scott,&nbsp;this build is amazing!!</p>

<h3>Hoverboard</h3>

<p>The second build is a popular trope in Part II, the&nbsp;<em>Hoverboard</em>. The main build is just extra pieces for the rebuilds, with only the actual hoverboard on top. The hoverboard piece is a printed piece and looks just like the film. The rebuilds,&nbsp;<em>Cyclone Board</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Ultimate Hoverjet</em>, are just created for the game and have added powers.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<h3>Adventure World</h3>

<p>This level pack unlocks the Back to the Future Adventure World. (The Doc Brown Fun Pack does the same). I love this adventure world! It looks just like Hill Valley 1985 in the films and has great detailing. There are two other versions of this world if you use time travel spots with the DeLorean to travel to the 1885 version from Part III and the 2015 version from Part II. You can visit the movie theatre in 2015, the courthouse in 1985, and the early town in 1885.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>When you play as Marty McFly, you unlock a new level (more on that later), but only one ability, which brings down his worht a little. His only ability is sonar smash, which he does with his guitar, a call to several scenes with him playing in the films.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Level</h3>

<p>Marty McFly also unlocks a new level, which makes up for the lack of abilities for the minifig. The level takes about 15 minutes to complete, possibly a&nbsp;bit longer if you go for the collectibles, and plays through the entire first film. Lots of elements from the film are removed, like Marty&#39;s parents&#39; relationship, Biff, and seeing Hill Valley in 1955. It&#39;s a nice short level compared to other levels in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Vehicles</h3>

<p>The DeLorean Time Machine can be used in levels and adventure worlds in certain spots to time travel to the past or future. The Electric Time Machine can do electrical spots, while the Ultra Time Machine can fly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hoveboard can be used to float across high areas to reach new areas. The rebuilds then act as flying vehicles.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>The set is a reasonable price considering the vehicles&#39; abilities in-game, the minifigure, the level, and the epic adventure world it unlocks. It is pricey in terms of price-per-piece, but is understandable with the theme. Still nice how you can use the figure and builds outside of the core game.</p>

"HandPositions","2020-11-26T18:30:21.577Z","Where We're Going, We Don't Need Roads","<p>LEGO set #71201 Back to the Future Level Pack is one of the best sets in the LEGO Dimensions theme. At a $30 retail in the year 2015 with only 94 pieces, it may seem extremely overpriced. However, both physically and in the Dimensions game, it is well worth the price. I recently purchased this set off of a Bricklink seller. Not only was it my first Bricklink order, it was also the first retired set I purchased. I have to say it is the best set LEGO Dimensions had to offer.<br />
The set only includes one minifigure, Marty McFly. He is a re - iteration of the character also available&nbsp;in the Ideas DeLorean Time Machine. He has a perfect face, with content and frightened expressions, with a rather standard but well - fitting hair piece. His iconic life vest is printed on his torso, and he has un - printed blue pants. He also includes a guitar element, and can be placed on the included Dimensions toy tag element.<br />
Other builds in this set include the DeLorean Time Machine and Hoverboard. The micro - scale DeLorean is well - built, using smaller but versatile pieces as most Dimensions builds need to in order for it to be converted into three separate models. The main build even allows for the doors to be opened, which I think is a nice touch. It can be converted into Electric and Flying versions of the model using in - game instructions. The Electric car is built well enough with the pieces provided, and the flying build is an excellent inclusion. The Hoverboard build contains an exclusive Hoverboard element, one of the main reasons many fans bought this set. It is built on a rather wacky model, so it can be converted into two other builds. The Hoverboard element is well - built, and allows for a minifigure to stand on it or carry it.<br />
In the game, the character and build unlock numerous bits of content, including a level, adventure world, and different abilities. Since it is called a Level Pack, it was necessary for it to include a level associated with its theme. Since it is a Back to the Future set, the level re - creates main points of the first BTTF film. It begins in Doc Brown&#39;s warehouse, where you play as Marty to test the guitar amplifier. After this short scene, it proceeds through the film, travelling back to 1955 using the Time - Travelling ability included with the DeLorean. Although it strays from the plot, making Marty time - travel by choice to warn Doc Brown of the attack, and the level is relatively short, it still captures the film well. The set also unlocks an adventure world, where you can travel through time in Hill Valley to complete restorations, quests, races, and other different challenges. It also includes ways to influence the future by doing things like planting flowers or digging in certain areas that appear in the future.<br />
The Marty McFly character in the game can do various things, such as destroy sonar panels with his guitar. He also says various recorded phrases that correspond with events around him. The Hoverboard build can jump, fly, destroy silver objects, and can even be customized to look different or play sounds. It even stops while hovering over water! The DeLorean build can use time - travel, acceleration switches, electricity, docking ports, and other in - game powers.<br />
Overall, this set was a great addition to my rather small LEGO Dimensions collection. Including three electronically interactive builds, along with the exclusive printed Hoverboard piece, this set is great for any Back to the Future fan or LEGO Dimensions collector.</p>
