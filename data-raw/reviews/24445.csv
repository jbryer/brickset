So if you got one of the Fun Packs from Series 1 you wouldn&rsquo;t need this pack to unlock the Adventure World. If you are a huge fan of LEGO Ninjago however all of the packs would interest you, and all of the characters have unique interactive dialogue between other characters in the game. That being said, let&rsquo;s get on with the review proper.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The packaging for this Team Pack match up with past reviews I&rsquo;ve done, please see the Jurassic Park review for a fully detailed discussion of the packaging. This box&rsquo;s differences is the imagery of Cole and Kai on the front with some Ninjago world elements visible in the background and that&rsquo;s pretty much it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">You&rsquo;ll find a collection of red and black pieces in this set, some gold weapons and not much else if you&rsquo;re looking for unique elements for MOCs. What is here though makes some pretty interesting builds.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Cole: Cole is identical here as he was in many other sets at the time, his printing is not unique, but it was a good way to pick one up for a &lsquo;reasonable&rsquo; price, depending on if you found this set during the discount period or not. It went as low as 5$ at Wal-Mart once Dimensions reached its inevitable conclusion. He carries a golden buildable scythe weapon which we&rsquo;ve seen before.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Kai: Again this is pretty much identical to prints we&rsquo;ve seen in other LEGO Ninjago sets of the time, the unique Toy Tags are the only thing differentiating Kai and Cole from other sets. He includes the Dragon Hilted sculpt of the Sword of Flames, and so you get to once again own this blade.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Boulder Bomber: This models build is a great miniature interpretation of the larger model seen in the Ninjago theme, and I believe the large draw of these Dimension Packs for Ninjago fans will be the inclusion of these small model builds of larger vehicles from the Theme. This build does take up considerable space on the Toy Tag though once attached, so when playing with it in-game you have to put it on the Toy Pad in certain ways to avoid taking up too much space for the other characters.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Boulder Blaster: This is a smaller model and the build reflects this. It still uses all of the same pieces, none of the parts are left out, and I find this model would probably be better to fit on the toy tag when playing with the in-game vehicle as it takes up less real-estate. I prefer the build of the first model however.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Cyclone Jet: Again a re-build into a flying vehicle, all of the models represent flight capable craft, I think only the first model is based on a larger set however. This model&rsquo;s build is not representative of the digital model, some parts have been swapped, which means the model is not fully realized as the designers built it inside the game. Personally I find this to be the weakest build of the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Blade Bike: This mode does not accommodate a Minifigure, there&rsquo;s no seat or anything as you build a smaller variant of Kai&rsquo;s bike, I believe from Year 2 or 3 of the series, but don&rsquo;t quote me on that. This model is the strongest looking one as it is the least ridiculous looking and resembles an actual bike.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Flying Fire Bike: Re-arranging the placement of the parts this build is just&hellip; ho-hum. It&rsquo;s a really silly bit of re-building, I think LEGO should have given us something more interesting than three variant motorcycles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Blades of Fire: Again you build a motorcycle, only this one has two katana sticking up in front with flame elements aimed forward and the rear of the model might be implying really short wings. This model is a huge disappointment as a build, all three of them pretty much have very similar builds it&rsquo;s only the changing placement of the parts that are done and in Kai&rsquo;s vehicle&rsquo;s case it just looks utterly terrible.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Boulder Bomber &amp; Alternate Models: All three of these mini-models for Cole&rsquo;s vehicles are relatively similar, the Cyclone Jet has a propeller design included with it, but honestly I prefer the Boulder Bomber as it is based on one of the larger models built for Cole and looks the most impressive, the other two models are too compact for my tastes rendering the vehicles much smaller looking while still relying on all of the same parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">It could be worse I suppose, but honestly all of the Ninjago vehicles have some merit in these small builds. I just feel that the other two alternate builds are unfortunately pointless compared to the main model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Blade Bike &amp; Alternate Models: Again all three models are pretty similar in their designs and builds, the Blade Bike and its two companions are far worse compared to Cole&rsquo;s vehicles. I&rsquo;d suggest just leaving the Blade Bike built on the Toy Tag and ignore the other models, since they are simply variants on the main bike model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The Digital Content</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Adventure World: Fans of Ninjago are going to love exploring the world of LEGO Ninjago in LEGO Dimensions. There are no additional levels based on the Theme, instead you get to explore the world of Ninjago with many familiar locations. No large Ninjago City to explore unfortunately, there&rsquo;s some buildings for a town and a lot of temples and things to puzzle through in order to unlock gold bricks and character specific quests, but that about covers it. You can journey under water and into the heart of a large volcano though, and dangerous skeleton warrior infested forests. Overall a pretty fun place to explore and try to find all the Easter Eggs for fans of the series, however if you weren&rsquo;t a fan of Ninjago you may find this adventure world to be a bit dull compared to some of the more expansive regions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Both Kai and Cole can access Spinjitzu switches, use stealth, acrobat and laser deflector puzzle elements, in fact the only ability not shared between the two ninjas is Cole&rsquo;s ability to destroy Cracked LEGO Objects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The vehicles are also somewhat repetitive, Kai&rsquo;s Blade Bike can only access accelerator switches, but once you upgrade it for the first time you can then access flight docks, flight cargo hooks and aerial races with both vehicles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The secondary upgrades also have the Special Attack ability which means they have unique attacks when fighting, Cole&rsquo;s Boulder Blaster adds the ability to destroy Silver LEGO Objects, but seems to lose that ability when you turn it into the Cyclone Jet. Honestly there is a lot of repetition between the vehicles and ninjas in this Team Pack.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is a bit trickier to finalize honestly, I would say that fans of the Ninjago Theme will probably want to play with all of their favorite Ninja characters in LEGO Dimensions, and the true fun is owning all of them so you can hear them have conversations amongst the team while playing with them on the Toy Pad.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">That being said, some of the other, cheaper, packs grant better abilities and so I&rsquo;d only recommend this set for folks who want the complete set. Mildly Recommended for the fans, but if you&rsquo;re just going for a complete game you can access the Ninjago Adventure World with one of the Fun Packs and unless Kai or Cole is your favorite character it&rsquo;d be better to get one of them.</span></span></span></span></p>
