"joeymeluso","2015-12-26T07:44:04.287Z","Like Batman with the Ability to Fly","<p>Christmas time brought me another LEGO Dimensions Fun Pack, this time it&#39;s Wonder Woman. Previously I discussed my underwhelming&nbsp;approval of Gollum, but Wonder Woman has more to bring to the toys-to-life table.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As a video game accessory, the box is small and simple to contain all of its parts in one bag. I found it peculiar that the Wonder Woman hair and lasso were together in a smaller specialized bag with the other parts (a bag I usually refer to as the &quot;mold bag&quot; for specialized or uncommon molds, i.e. Friends minidolls torsos and hair). The instructions were only to build the minifigure, so if one does not have the Starter Pack to get the digital instructions, they can find the instructions for each build on LEGO.com.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Outside of the minifigure, the parts are almost entirely the same color - trans-clear. Only a few parts are light bluish grey (5) and trans-red (4). This is helpful fo the intended &quot;invisible&quot; effect of the builds, while also offering a few interesting parts in trans-clear. Nothing new in trans-clear outside of the 1x1 studded pole or the 4 winglets with clips.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Wonder Woman is the same exact variant as in Superman vs Power Armor Lex (6862). If one didn&#39;t obtain that set, this figure is better to get recently and cheaper. However, it adds nothing new to the Wonder Woman wardrobe. I do like this classic color scheme better than the version from 76026, much like the Superman of the 6862 set.</p>

<p>IN GAME: Wonder Woman is as useful as Batman in game, and by that I mean the following abilities: she can target multiple items to destroy with a boomerang, and use her lasso to tug at a pulley. However, she can fly with the Wonder Woman theme playing in the background during flight, and her hearts are changed to silver (much like a vehicle&#39;s health), which makes her last better against foes attacking her.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple yet interesting among each model. The parts are used well for their shapes and styles. All of the models are not the same appearance in game however, and a minifigure cannot fit on the toy form of each model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Invisible Jet is an incredible miniature model. The light bluish grey elements are easily mixed in with the trans-clear elements to make the model on the whole seem clear. The style is unique, especially the use of clear bottles for the simulated projectiles. The winglets can move up and down on the model, which is the only play feature and involves 4&nbsp;articulated points. I also found the front to hold up better than my expectations, as I was afraid while building that it will fall apart multiple times.</p>

<p>The Stealth Laser Shooter is interesting in shape, with the front wider than the middle and rear. The light bluish grey holds up well for the invisibility appearance, but it seems interesting that the bottles are used for two separate lasers, one behind another.</p>

<p>The Torpedo Bomber does an adequate job for the invisibility appearance.&nbsp;It looks interesting but slightly shorter than the previous models by a stud. Using the winglets&nbsp;on the back is creative but I fail to find the purpose of its shape.</p>

<p>IN GAME: Each model seems fast and able to fly easily in various levels, but the upgrades are simple and common among other vehicles. The Stealth Laser Shooter is helpful for a consistent laser shot when held down, or if one doesn&#39;t have a minifigure with a laser cutter ability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The minifugre is good for collecting if one doesn&#39;t already have it from its previous release in 2012. In game Wonder Woman is very useful, moreso than Batman in some ways. The Invisible Jet is my personal favorite of the three builds, with a good flow of style and believing its invisible appearance. The other models show the light bluish grey pieces slightly more than the jet, but they still have unique shapes. As toys they make interesting miniature display pieces, very limited on play features.&nbsp;In game the best uses are&nbsp;for flying and laser shooting, much like Benny&#39;s Spaceship. Not many characters have interacted with her in terms of voices, outside of Wyldstyle asking how she and Superman are doing, and Wicked Witch calling her &quot;another&nbsp;Good Witch&quot;. I&#39;m sure in future waves she will interact more with DC Comic characters like Superman.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty nice, with good artwork.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>...are very hard to see when building. Jokes aside, the pieces here are pretty good, with lots of clear pieces for the Invisible Jet. The NFC base for Wonder Woman is decorated nicely as usual, with her stacked-W logo on red, and the white stars on blue.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Wonder Woman is the same as the 2012 version, so it&#39;s a great way to get her if you didn&#39;t the first time around. Her hair, legs, and lasso are all packaged separately, proof that they were all made in China.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly simple, but I was surprised by the use of bottles as guns on the jet!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The jet looks nice, and much more traditional than the full-sized one that came out last year.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Like the Wicked Witch, Wonder Woman is another letter&nbsp;W-alliterative character who&#39;s basically an upgraded version of a Starter Pack character, namely,&nbsp;Batman. She has his ability to grapple and use boomerang switches, but trades stealth for mind control, super strength, and flight. She can also deflect lasers and dive underwater.&nbsp;As in&nbsp;<em>LEGO Batman 3,&nbsp;</em>whenever she flies, the Wonder Woman TV theme plays, which is a cute detail the first few times, but quickly becomes a bit annoying.</p>

<p>The Invisible Jet isn&#39;t very amazing, having the basic flying-vehicle abilities to pick up energy cargo and drop it into switches and to dock on jet switches and activate them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this pack is a good option to have, but not necessary, as it doesn&#39;t unlock a new world, If you want an alternative to Batman, though, this is a good choice.</p>

They are also filled with interesting builds and ideas and characters, despite some of them being pretty identical to one another. That being said as a person invested in LEGO Dimensions I purchased every pack I could, so we&rsquo;re on to reviewing the Fun Packs with this review and our first offering is Wonder Woman.</span></span></span></span></p>

All three builds are similar to LEGO Polybags with miniature vehicles, this and the Jet could be sold by themselves for 5$ and work very well as models and fun little vehicle builds.</span></span></span></span></p>

I suppose it depends on if you enjoy the character, definitely get it for discount prices if you&rsquo;re a fan of LEGO Dimensions and want to experience the miniature models in this set, the vehicle builds are all mostly fairly fun to play with and display. Honestly though if you&rsquo;re looking to just complete the game 100% Wonder Woman does not have any unique or puzzle specific abilities that aren&rsquo;t found with other characters, so I can say safely this one might be one to skip. Recommended only for fans of the character or those who want a complete collection.</span></span></span></span></p>
