"MeggyM00","2015-11-18T19:33:45.523Z","Spaceship! Spaceship! SPACESHIP!","<p>I should preface this review by saying I&#39;m a big fan of Benny, so obviously my opinion is biased by that &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Well the box is the now familiar Dimensions Fun/Team/Level format. The classisist&nbsp;in me would prefer the standard cuboid, but it serves a purpose. No instructions in the box, but putting Benny together is simple, and as soon as you pop him on the game pad, the instructions pop up for the first spaceship model.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing really out of the ordinary here.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Benny. And Benny is awesome.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I did enjoy putting the first spaceship together, I&#39;m yet to build the other two models, but I suspect the first option will be the form I mostly keep it in.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">completed model</span></p>

<p>I love that classic spaceship shape of the first model. So much so, that I have lost some desire to get the big version.&nbsp;I know the form of the real life model has no real impact on the game, but there is something great about having part of the game in the flesh in front of you when you are playing. It doesn&#39;t take a great suspension of disbelief to imagine you are placing it in the game when you pop it in the pad &nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Overall opinion</span></p>

<p>I think this is one of the must have sets for dimensions. I don&#39;t know why, but going through the game, which the occasional cry of &#39;spaceship!&#39; doesn&#39;t stop making us laugh. I also love what he makes the other characters, particularly Wyldstyle, say whilst he or the ship are in play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The way Benny bounds around the game world is also pretty adorable. I can&#39;t see us playing the game, without him on the pad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only negative I have, which applies to all the fun and team packs, is that the pricing is bit too high for what you get. Compared to a Level pack, when you get the models, minifigs, AND&nbsp;a level, they don&#39;t represent brilliant value.&nbsp;</p>

"Square","2016-03-18T06:33:50.21Z","Space through the Dimensions; if you can.","<p>Benny is one of the character in The Lego Movie, characterized as a 1980&#39;s figure. While he only played one major role in the movie, how good does he preform in a Toys-to-Life genre?</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box is unique of having a weird angle, but the top-half is thin that cause it to floop; which could bend. The instruction only shows you how to build the figure, forcing you to use the internet or in-game for instruction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>With only 46 pieces from a 14.99$ set, theirs not alot to talk about. The base plate for Benny is simple but effective to show who figure it belongs to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>Benny is the same varient in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70810-1/MetalBeard-s-Sea-Cow"">MetalBear&#39;s Sea Cow</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70816-1/Benny-s-Spaceship-Spaceship-SPACESHIP!"">Benny&#39;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!</a> Making this set the cheapest way to obtain him, however the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70818-1/Double-Decker-Couch"">Double-Decker Couch</a> make this set underwealming since it has more parts, same retail price, and a exlusive Benny face print.<!--StartFragment--></p>

<p>&nbsp;
<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>
</p>

<p>A very simple and small build, their is a 3-in-1 build for alternate model (not recommended to unlock) to give a similar appearance in-game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The First build does cover some of Benny original SPACESHIP aspect, but theirs some issues... The in-game shows a larger scale which diminish the model you built in real life.</p>

<p>The Second build turns the spaceship into a Lasercraft, it still suffer the &quot;diffrent in-game model look&quot;, but the build is fine. Also to note this is the best spaceship version since it create a laser beam to create havic.</p>

<p>The Third and final build is The Annihilaor, the build is the least accurate appearance in-game and feels alittle incomplete from the wing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>

<p>Benny has pretty similar ability with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71204-1/Level-Pack-Doctor-Who"">The Doctor</a> but Benny &quot;space-movement&quot; cause him to preform slow; cause this detail a con for gameplay. He does maintain his original voice actor, Charlie Day, with new lines to not give a disbelief interaction like they did with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71213-1/Fun-Pack-Bad-Cop"">Bad Cop</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>If you like Benny or Classic Space, he would be a nice add-on for the game. However his gameplay isn&#39;t anything exciting and lack of new/unique parts. He&#39;s one of other packs that isn&#39;t recommended to complete the game, he&#39;s just there for the shake for the community/budget.</p>

The saving grace here is being able to get Benny without hunting down the more expensive and long retired Sea Cow or larger Spaceship sets from The LEGO Movie. Considering many of the Dimensions sets are on deep discount this more than makes up for a lackluster digital content offering. Definitely pick this up for Benny and the models if you can find it on the cheap. Somewhat recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Minifigure: </strong>Benny is amazing. The cracked helmet mixed with the scratched torso will make any classic space fans day. I love that they made&nbsp;a double-sided face with the classic spaceman face and a new face print&nbsp;that looks so much like Benny.</p>

<p><strong>Gameplay:&nbsp;</strong>I don&#39;t have the game, so I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>This set is great. Benny is wonderful and one of my favorite minifigures&nbsp;and the spaceship looks so much like the classic spaceship. If you find him, buy him! You won&#39;t regret it.</p>
