"8BrickMario","2016-01-13T15:51:17.04Z","A good option if you need a ninja!","<p>Out of all the Ninjago packs, I decided to choose this one due to the abilities it provided. [insert cliche&nbsp;&quot;was it the right choice?&quot; question to hook readers]</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is nicely designed to stand out on the shelf, although it does blend in with all of the similar Dimensions boxes. Perhaps a different background color for each character would be better.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has very few notable parts to me, with the most interesting perhaps being the golden 2x2 round tile.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Zane here is in his Titanium Ninja form, which looks great. His head has two sides, one with a blue HUD and an eyepiece, and another with the more humanoid silver faceplate and uncovered eyes. While the former looks better under the hood, the latter looks better uncovered. His body is nicely patterned with his robes, and there&#39;s a power core on his back. He comes with his traditional shurikens, making his katana-holding shoulder armor seem a bit pointless.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for the NinjaCopeter is pretty good, with the central turbine incorporated pretty nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The NinjaCopter itself looks okay, and is recognizable as Cyrus Borg&#39;s vehicle, now owned by Zane. However, I think it might have looked that much better if they had recolored the valve wheels in pearl gold to match the giant turbine in the middle, both from the show and the full-sized set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>I chose Zane because he seemed to be one of the more useful ninja. His abilities are to use acrobatic objects, activate Spinjitzu switches which require the extra centrifugal force to push down, and use stealth and X-ray vision. While he doesn&#39;t have anything else, he&#39;s still good to have for the aforementioned abilities. Like the other ninja, Zane has a Spinjitzu meter which increases after defeating enemies, similarly to the Chima character&#39;s CHI meters. Using Spinjitzu in combat tosses enemies around, and in this case, freezes them and breaks them apart. In this way, the meter can be kept at a stable fullness, as combat fills it up and its best use is...in combat!&nbsp;However, I have found the frozen enemies to be a bit buggy, sometimes being stuck in ice instead of shattering like they&#39;re supposed to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ninja-Copter is fairly basic, not too&nbsp;special, but it does have the basic flying vehicle abilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ninjago&nbsp;Adventure World he granted me access to is nice, with some important characters and locations featured. The world seems mostly patterned on the early show and the Tournament of Elements arc, featuring Master Chen&#39;s arena (which must be restored), a village area, some caves, a large volcano, the Valley of Despair (the Skullkin&#39;s&nbsp;home), and the mountain monastery/dojo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this pack is a good choice for Wave 1, even if you get the other ninja, since he has some useful abilities for puzzle-solving.&nbsp;</p>

There&rsquo;s some nice interaction dialogue between him and other characters too, so he&rsquo;s all around really a good pack to get if you&rsquo;re not trying to get every single pack from the game.</span></span></span></span></p>
