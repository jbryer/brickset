"joeymeluso","2015-12-26T07:02:04.737Z","Better off with Other Fun Packs","<p>Santa brought me some LEGO this Christmas, and among them was the Gollum Fun Pack for LEGO Dimensions. I was somewhat informed of what this pack did in-game before I received this set, and I was curious to find out what else was in store.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and instructions are very simple for this set. As a video game accessory it will be in the electronics section of your local store, and the box is small enough to pack all the pieces without wasting material. The instructions, much like the other LEGO Dimensions sets, only shows how to build the figure Gollum, while the game has digital instructions for building the spider and other bulids. Instructions can also be found on LEGO.com, just in case one&nbsp;wanted the product for its parts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are few and not too varied in this set. Most of the set contains black, dark bluish grey and dark brown elements with some hints of light bluish grey, white and trans-yellow. The only noteworthy parts in this set, outside of the figure, are the dark bluish grey arms, which I don&#39;t recall in many other sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Gollum is the same figure from previous LOTR sets, no new printing or special poses. Having been the only Gollum I&#39;ve held in hand, I still think this expression is pretty good for him and the mold for his body suits his character well.</p>

<p>IN GAME: The highlight of Gollum is his ability to crawl in tight spaces made for shorter minifigures. However, every other part of him is a disadvantage. He walks slower than other characters, his bone targeting attack is only good to target one item at a time (compared to Wonder Woman or Batman, who can target 3-5 at a time).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The builds for these three models are very simple, to the point that one would expect more to be built. The low part count makes it easy for children, but underwhelming for adults compared to other Fun Pack models.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The first build, Shelob the Great, looks accurate in miniature form to its movie counterpart. I like the open studs around the front to simulate his eye sockets, but I am thrown off by the trans-yellow used behind the model.</p>

<p>The 8-Legged Walker contradicts its name as a build, since only 6 legs are built. It&#39;s an interesting remake for a spider model but nothing more impressive than Shelob.</p>

<p>Poison Slinger is able to hold on the vehicle base well for its pose, but on its own the legs cannot support the whole model.</p>

<p>IN GAME: The models move&nbsp;rather quickly but seems basic on its features and upgrades. It&#39;s useful as a rideable, fast vehicle to bypass areas with ease, but not functional for any unlockable content.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Out of all the Fun Packs I built thus far, this is one of the worst I&#39;ve come accross. It&#39;s a simple build with interesting alternate models but its functions are very limited as a toy (mostly hinged articulation). Gollum is the only reason to pick this up, as well as the dark bluish grey arms, unless one has collected them from other previous LOTR sets. Off the base, the models can stand up on their own outside of the Poison Slinger in the intended pose.</p>

<p>IN GAME: This was less than I expected for functions in LEGO Dimensions. The only redeeming quality is the small hatch ability, but it&#39;s better found with other more useful characters such as Bart Simpson or Gimli. The interaction with this character and others (in terms of voice acting) is subpar. I&#39;ve only found Wonder Woman and LOTR characters reacting to Gollum&#39;s presence; although it was funny to hear Wonder Woman say her golden&nbsp;bracelets were not the Precious that Gollum was seeking.</p>

<p>In total, pass this one up. It&#39;s the least functional Fun Pack as a toy and as a video game accessory for LEGO Dimensions.</p>

"Andy317","2018-07-05T14:19:07.857Z","Meh. Another overpriced Dimensions pack. ","<p>The value for this set is just awful. There are no exclusive parts or minifigures except for the toy tags included. You&rsquo;re essentially paying 15$ for a world already unlocked in the game via Gandalf who comes with the starter pack, as well as a non-exclusive Minifigure with a minuscule spider build. Don&rsquo;t buy this sealed for more than $5.&nbsp;</p>

This one isn&rsquo;t as much fun to play with off the toy tag because of the odd proportions and the rearing to strike pose, which means you can&rsquo;t make it look like it&rsquo;s walking, but it still looks good for a display option.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;d strongly recommend getting him if you&rsquo;re interested in getting 100% complete for the game. The models are a huge bonus too.</span></span></span></span></p>
