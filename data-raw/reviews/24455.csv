"8BrickMario","2016-01-27T17:14:35.92Z","Aiming for greatness, but just misses the target.","<p>Legolas was a character I got purely for the ability to aim at targets, so I had low expectations. Was I correct?</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is pretty nice, with the typical artwork showing off the product nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are fairly standard, with the standouts being the 2x2 round jumper tile in reddish brown, the small dish-shaped wheels,&nbsp;and the NFC base decorated with Elvish designs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Legolas here is a pretty nice figure, as I hadn&#39;t had him before. His hair is a nice piece, cast in cool yellow and molded with his ears. It&#39;s detailed with some braiding and is pretty long, too. His torso and legs are also nicely detailed and accurate to the movies.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fairly easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model itself is supposed to be some sort of crossbow on a cart, but it just screams &quot;filler&quot; to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Legolas is a character I find myself using, but very little. As mentioned before, he can shoot target switches (not an exclusive ability), is acrobatic, and has the exclusive ability to fire arrows into special sockets, which can then be swung on like an acrobatic pole. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t think of a single instance in which the arrow sockets can&#39;t be bypassed, and they ususally don&#39;t lead to important collectibles, anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arrow launcher is one of the weakest vehicles out there. I don&#39;t believe it has any unique or practical abilities in-game.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This pack is one best skipped. While the figure is nice, it&#39;s not new, and the abilities granted by this pack are best gained through another character.&nbsp;</p>

Which is accurate, I believe what they&rsquo;ve done here is take the original torso and legs and put them together with the Hobbit head/facial prints, which technically makes this a unique and different looking Minifigure compared to what we saw during the days of The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit set releases.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Arrow Launcher is pretty much identical to its digital model, it looks great, the only thing missing between the two models is the clip on the back for a Minifigure to hold onto.</span></span></span></span></p>

If you missed out on the original theme and want that torso and leg print from The Lord of the Rings for your Legolas Minifigure you&rsquo;d definitely want to pick this pack up while it&rsquo;s still around at discount. If not I&rsquo;d say skipping it is a viable option to preserve money.</span></span></span></span></p>
