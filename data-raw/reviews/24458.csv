"8BrickMario","2016-01-10T01:00:15.76Z","It's not hard to ""Stay...positive..."" about this pack!","<p>Once again, Unikitty was entirely a&nbsp;completion-driven purchase. However, I&#39;m still quite pleased.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is nice, and shows off the models for the vehicle and some nice artwork on the front.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are pretty nice, with some good colorful 1x1 studs and the pastels used on Unikitty. Unikitty&#39;s NFC base is nice, decorated with clouds and rainbows. However, due to her 3-stud long body, she only attaches with one stud and hangs off a bit, which is less than great.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>We get yet another new Unikitty in this set, with a cute small smile and an&nbsp;almost expectant expression. The rest of the &quot;figure&quot; is built out of the same pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This build was fairly simple compared to the others.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Cloud Cuckoo Car is a fun little model, matching the other cutesy and wacky constructions native to Cloud Cuckoo Land. The car is a flying vehicle with a duck face on the front and some flower decorations, and is a nice little piece.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Unikitty plays pretty much identically to the way she did in&nbsp;<em>The LEGO Movie Videogame</em>. Once again, she is the only character that can interact with rainbow-colored bricks, and she can transform into Rage Kitty for a short amound of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Cloud Cuckoo Car is very useful once it&#39;s upgraded to its second form, the X-Stream Soaker. The constant water flowing from the vehicle can put out fires, grow plants, and clear toxic goop, and, with the Mystery Machine,&nbsp;is the only way to do any of those until Aquaman and Slimer&#39;s release.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This pack is a good one to have, and necessary for completionists. However, unless you&#39;re a devoted Unikitty collector, I wouldn&#39;t recommend this to non-players.&nbsp;</p>

She&rsquo;s built pretty much the same way every Unikitty pre-new neck piece attachment plate, so her head is more prone to popping off from the torso.</span></span></span></span></p>

Interesting enough it is designed to accommodate a Minifigure or Unikitty, though the single stud jumper plate is the only connector so she will easily fall off during play. Minifigures can stand behind the steering wheel on two studs, it&rsquo;s nice to get a model that Minifigs can fit on though.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a nice nod to old school LEGO as far as names go, however the model is far from X-Treme. It alters the placement of numerous parts opening up the driver&rsquo;s area a bit to better accommodate Minifigs, and it&rsquo;s designed to shoot water out as we&rsquo;ll see in the abilities discussion.</span></span></span></span></p>

This one can&rsquo;t accommodate Minifigs sadly, Unikitty should still be able to fit on the jumper behind the steering wheel, but there&rsquo;s no way to put Minifigs there.</span></span></span></span></p>

So I&rsquo;d definitely recommend tracking it down and getting it if you&rsquo;re a fan of Unikitty. If you&rsquo;d rather ignore this variant and don&rsquo;t care much for her in the game then it&rsquo;s safe to skip her as Lumpy Space Princess can also use the Rainbow LEGO Objects ability. Still recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
