From the pictures and displays in LEGO stores in didn&#39;t look appealing, but once built and in my hands it&#39;s actually super awesome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I used to collect Star Wars action figures but quit after it got really expensive. This new buildable figures are of course not as &quot;accurate&quot; as normal action figures but they have a rather unique charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The size is I think what appeals to me. Kinda perfect for display and play. The poseability is better than expected but not perfect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I started collecting the troopers when I saw the stormtrooper and scout trooper constraction photos. I can&#39;t wait for clone troopers constraction. Cmon LEGO make them!</p>
