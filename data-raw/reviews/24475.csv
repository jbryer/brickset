<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a polybag. It does not actually contain paper instructions but this should not be an obstacle</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Two parts are fairly rare ; the white round plate for the cake actually has a small nipple (I could not even find it on LDD), and the flower base is a part I had never seen before.</p>

<p>The small stereo has a pink printed plate (no sticker) which is a nice thing for a set that size. There is also a pink dish which the target audience will certainly appreciate. It&#39;s a party after all!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifigs</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very easy, although there were no instructions.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s really awesome. My daughter has immediately found a use for it and used it as a setting for ... well the Stephanie triplets she has.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very nice small set for the intended audience.</p>
