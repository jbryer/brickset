"ThoughtLash","2016-01-03T23:47:02.36Z","Prototype Boba Fett!","<p>This is a review for the Boba Fett minifig ONLY.&nbsp; The book is pretty much the 1st edition with a few extras for the sets since.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>No case/box for the book, but the minifig is sealed in a small plastic capsule in the front cover.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Boba Fett&#39;s parts are the only ones here, a generic clone head (non-angry version), body, legs, jetpack, helmet, and rangefinder.&nbsp; All except the pack, rangefinder, and head are unique to this book.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The concept Fett is VERY detailed, and looks like a miniaturized version of the original suit.&nbsp; He consists mostly of black and white, just like a super Stormtrooper should (Fett&#39;s original design was for a Stormtrooper variant).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The&nbsp;body is already assembled in the packaging, all you have to do is stick the jetpack and rangefinder on.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A minifig, a nice one yes, but a minifig.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A good book, fun to read, and it includes an exclusive minifigure.&nbsp; What&#39;s not to like?</p>

This figure is a must have for any LEGO&reg; Star&trade; collecter. The minifigure&nbsp;is based off the concept art for Boba&nbsp;Fett&nbsp;(Though the ORIGINAL concept art by Ralph Mcquarrie is of an elite stormtrooper and the helmate design was later used for Rako Hardeen in the Star Wars&trade; Clone Wars tv series).The detailing is great and it is a great improvment from the last white Boba&nbsp;Fett&nbsp;we got. The book however is not as good. It has a lot of great pictures and facts, but there are quite a few mistakes that are annoying to people who actually know the real facts. These can easily be ignored however and the book can still be enjoyable. If you like information on Star Wars&trade; caracters and LEGO minifigures, than this is a good book for you.</p>
