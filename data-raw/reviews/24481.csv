"Tuzi","2022-10-28T14:57:30.187Z","Too small and hard to wash","<p>I purchased this mug on the day of the opening of the new LEGO store in The Hague, The Netherlands for ten bucks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s good hard plastic and easy enough to hold, weighs about 116 grams and has a capacity of 240ml.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And that&#39;s about all there is. You can&#39;t really put it in the dishwasher because the hollow handle and the hollow bottom trap a lot of water, so hand-washing is unfortunately required. It&#39;s nice to have, but I doubt I will be using this myself - It is just too small to hold enough liquids.</p>
