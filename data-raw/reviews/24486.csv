<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">Juniors, a theme designed for the youngest of Lego fans or is it more than that? I would like to give that question a bold, yes! Still skeptical? Read on!</b></h3>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">Minifigures</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">This set has two minifigures, both with identical worker overalls and red safety helmets. The only difference is their heads. One sports a brown goatee. The other is clean-shaven with orange protective glasses printed over his eyes. Although, almost entirely the same, they seem completely accurate as to what roadside workers look like. Besides, I always like adding to my Lego City&rsquo;s personnel and these guys are no exception.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">The Completed Model</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">This is a Juniors set and that means two things: less building and no stickers. A reasonable trade off, even when talking about the main build of this set, the truck. Although the base is one piece I am not upset by its involvement. The tires fit smoothly underneath and provide an excellent starting point for the mostly yellow truck to ride on. The stickered plates on either side give ample warning to all minifigures and the warning lights on the top see to this end as well. Another printed part adds the engine details to the front, but more thought was obviously put into the exhaust components towards the middle of the truck. Their only downfall is the fact that they are easy to bump off in the direction of the front or back. The truck bed is perfect for loading and unloading the digger as is the simple, but effective ramp.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">The digger itself has a solid build from the tires up and is composed mostly of orange elements. The rollcage is realistic. I think any minifigure should feel safe behind the controls. The bucket at the front is expertly molded and has a large range of motion. The same goes for the crane hook in the back. This machine definitely has a lot of play value.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">The detour sign is almost certainly my favorite side build in this set. I mean, where else do you get this useful object in a Lego set? It even has an exquisitely printed sign to complete the effect. I quickly placed this on a major road in my Lego City. There are also two red-striped pylons which have been integrated into this set. They are easy to assemble, but look fabulous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">An exclusive bin is included here. I believe that green was an appropriate choice and the whole piece is well molded. I could even see this becoming a dump truck bed. You are instructed to add a light on a pole and a handle to this, but I think it looks just fine without. Some blocks are loose and probably supposed to represent dirt.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">A smaller green bin is also featured here. It basically amounts to a box. However, you can store some of the accessories inside, making it quite useful. These accessories include a jack hammer, shovel, and tool box. All very nicely made and undoubtedly welcome details.&nbsp;</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">Overall</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-1092b178-7fff-196b-2ef5-5e4eff31172d"">Minifigures for army building, several exclusive, mostly printed parts, and an array of construction equipment? This set certainly has plenty to offer! I am glad I got this and I would like to say that most AFOLs will be too. You can never judge a book by its cover.&nbsp;</b></p>
