Retail price is $39.99&nbsp;US, and it really is worth that much, I got it on sale for $29.99 and it is definitely more worthy of that price, but it just has enough parts to reach $39.99.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with no exclusive parts to just this set, but it does come with some rare tires only seen in two other sets (3 in total) it also comes with the new disk shooter for both the Jay Walker One and the Ghost Shrine, there is one nostalgic&nbsp;thing about this set, it has the same&nbsp;Brick With Bow 1X10&nbsp;pieces from the set 9442, accept this set has a better quantity of it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are nothing special, but the character of them is! This is the only way to get Wail and&nbsp;Ghurka, and a cheaper way to get Jay &amp;&nbsp;Bansha&nbsp;with the Ghost Tail, but other then that I would suggest looking at the pictures to get a better idea of everything, once you see one ghost you have seen &#39;em all!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very big but not that complex, I have to say you might screw up a couple of times, or at&nbsp;least try, I don&#39;t want to be the only person to have to use the brick separator ten times on this set because I misplaced a brick or ten, oh and this is one of the other sets to have a shrine or place to hold the aeroblade.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is very cool and somewhat bulky and sleek, the shrine is great just for attacking the jay walker one, and its got a good design, the Jay Walker One itself is a really cool looking big machine, its the biggest vehicle in the Ghost Wave if you are not counting the Destiny&#39;s Bounty, also&nbsp;never flip it over, the bottom of the vehicle looks really dull and plain, but then again..its not meant to be flipped over.&nbsp;There is a brown case behind the driver&#39;s seat that has some ghost disk in it that can be shot from the gun, I don&#39;t like having to pull up the trans blue ghost carry case just to shoot it, so I would recommend disconnecting the gun from the trans blue case, also not sure if its just me or not, but I feel like the disk launcher on the vehicle was not all that well made, it has a nice design but if you hold onto the sides of it and put a disk through it will get stuck in the middle multiple times, try and hold it from the front or don&#39;t hold it at all.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is a very nice set for $39.99 Retail, I got it on sale for $29.99 and I suggest you do the same, seems like its cutting close to the 40 dollar mark, but hey, its got the only Jay in the Ghost Wave that comes with his vehicle&nbsp;so why not?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only thing I would fix is probably make the gun bigger because the disk sometimes get stuck when you hold the gun and push the disk through, oh and the flag piece is at a weird angle, but I guess its pretty neat, since it carries the sleek flow through it.</p>

<p>And did I mention Jay has a&nbsp;Electropack?!</p>
