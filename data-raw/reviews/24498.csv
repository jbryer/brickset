<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box art is pretty nice, and everything is shown off nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are pretty good, with the different shades of green on the Velociraptor and the printed gyrosphere dishes standing out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Owen Grady, one of the film&#39;s main characters, is a pretty nice figure, and no different from the one in the sets. His vest looks good, and the rest of his outfit is nicely detailed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ACU is also decent, and while similar, doesn&#39;t exactly match any of the ACU troopers in the sets. His vest is nice, and his staff is a simple yet effective assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All being said, they&#39;re good accurate figures, but they both feel incredibly generic out of context.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Velociraptor is a pretty nice model, and looks like it&#39;s supposed to. Its legs, arms, and head can be moved to pose it a bit, which is a plus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gyrosphere&nbsp;is speeding along a bumpy terrain (which I think is supposed to be a smooth ramp), and it looks pretty good. While they couldn&#39;t enclose it completely, the shape is conveyed nicely, and the blue streaks of speed are a nice touch.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Owen&#39;s a useful character, if you read &quot;useful&quot; as &quot;has an exclusive ability&quot;. &nbsp;He is able to cut down long vines covering doorways or serving as walls with his knife. He is also able to track trails and use stealth by wearing a leaf cloak. His dialogue is best summed up as &quot;Dinosaurs, dinosaurs, dinosaurs.&quot;</p>

<p>The ACU is a pretty basic character, with his main ability being to charge electric coils with his stun staff. His dialogue is all complaints about his job.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Velociraptor is a normal walker vehicle, and it serves as an alternative to Owen if you want to cut vines. Why is it that these abilities are always given in packs where the character included can do it just as well? It&#39;s just a sort of fake way to allow your other characters to solve the puzzles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Gyrosphere is a necessary vehicle in the game, due to its unique ability to use gyrosphere switches recycled from&nbsp;<em>LEGO Batman 2</em>. The model conjures a full-sized gyrosphere in-game, which is good. Otherwise, it&#39;s a nice vehicle (can&#39;t jump, though) and it can be upgraded for sonar or greater speed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Jurassic World is a nice adventure world, with the park and some of the scenery being included. Space isn&#39;t wasted, as some underground tunnels and laboratories are also available for exploration. It&#39;s definitely one of the more pretty worlds due to its natural scenery.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure if Jurassic World really fits with Dimensions. Its core concept is a bit of a fantastic stretch, but everything in it has a more realistic base&nbsp;and is less zany and weird than the other worlds and franchises in the game, making the sillier spin on the dialogue just seem stupid. That being said, the pack is pretty good and provides another step toward a complete Dimensions experience, so I&#39;d recommend picking it up.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Venom Raptor: I think this is an attempt to make a Dilophosaurus, but rather than just call it a Dilophosaurus, as the build is definitely more designed to resemble that species as seen in Jurassic Park, they&rsquo;ve decided to turn it into a Venom Raptor. I guess this means that Raptors can shoot venom now&hellip; it&rsquo;s a really odd design, but the build is relatively easy and fun looking, the colours even work as a Dilophosaurus.</span></span></span></span></p>

It also doesn&rsquo;t resemble the actual LEGO model while the in-game version does look like the actual physical model of this vehicle from the Theme. It&rsquo;s a nice looking micro-build though that captures the look of the vehicle and some terrain as it travels along with it.</span></span></span></span></p>

This build changes the base, the rest of the build is also modified. It&rsquo;s still fairly simple to follow along and build though.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s pretty simple and easy to follow along with though.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall you can&rsquo;t go wrong in any of these that you choose to build and display when playing with the physical models.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s basically a more self-contained version of what we saw in the LEGO Jurassic World video game, there aren&rsquo;t as many locations, or dinosaurs roaming in the paddocks&hellip; at least in the PS3 version, I believe more dinosaurs become visible in the hub world on current gen consoles.</span></span></span></span></p>
