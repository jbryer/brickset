<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art is pretty nice, and shows off everything inside nicely.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are pretty good, with the standouts being the medium azure parts on the Mystery Machine and the lime green flame/plume parts. Like always, the NFC bases for the characters are nicely decorated for the characters&#39; themes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Shaggy and Scooby-Doo are the sixth of each I now own, but they&#39;re still good minifigures. Scooby here is the sitting variant.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The builds here were pretty simple.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Scooby Snack build is fairly simple, but it&#39;s alright. The top is the real mystery- what is that? Butter? Cheese?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mystery Machine is a very nice build, with the floral decorations being cleverly done with flower parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Shaggy and Scooby-Doo play nicely, with both of them being able to track, following trails to find something buried or hidden, and they have stealth, which consists of the two dressing up in Bo Peep-style costumes to sneak past cameras.&nbsp;Both are also able to glide slowly downward from tall heights, with Scooby holding some sort of dishes, and Shaggy flapping his arms. Touches like those really capture the silliness of the cartoon and are a lot of fun.&nbsp;Shaggy&nbsp;is able to illuminate with his flashlight, and Scooby can dig up dirt patches and dive underwater.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Scooby Snack build is okay, with its first build having the ability being to grant the player a temporary size increase, its second to explode gold LEGO, and its third rebuild allowing the character to turn into a ghost with stealth. I feel this is&nbsp;another redundant build given the abilities of the characters in the pack, but combined with other characters, it might be useful.</p>

<p>The Mystery Machine is decent, with its basic form only being able to use accelerator switches. The second build, a pick-up truck, allows you to pull down weak walls, but the third build, the Mystery Monster,&nbsp;is the most useful, with its jets of water being able to extinguish fires, grow plants, clear toxic waste, and fill up water-container switches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The alternate skins here are actually noteworthy here, with one of them being a phosphorescent green and having a LEGO ghost face!</p>

<p>The open world that you can access is fun, too. Like in the story level, everything in the world adopts a lower-shaded, outlined appearance, as if being drawn by animators. While the series isn&#39;t known for its iconic locations, all of the classic spooky places have been included, with a funfair, haunted house, lighthouse, mines, a cemetery,&nbsp;and a shipwreck all available to explore. There are some fun quests, but some of the puzzles and the race atop the lighthouse are difficult.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this pack is well worth getting. The characters are a lot of fun and have some useful abilities, and the vehicles and the world they open up to you are good, too.&nbsp;</p>

The top has been reduced in scale and it now looks more like you&rsquo;ve built a Mystery Truck capable of seating only two people. It&rsquo;s equally fun to build, but not the best model.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s an interesting idea, but could use more work in my opinion as the top appears to be far too easy to separate from the base.</span></span></span></span></p>

These builds fit his character, but it is really weak considering Shaggy got the Mystery Machine.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Mystery Monster is just a bit weaker comparatively and I prefer the other two models in looks and functionality.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Scooby Snack &amp; Alternate Models: There isn&rsquo;t much to discuss here, honestly you can have one of three different sandwich builds, other than that I think they&rsquo;re comparatively weak when looking at models such as the DeLorean, Ecto-1, Mystery Machine or even the Flying Monkey. All of the models are functional though, so there is that going for them.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;m a real fan of Scooby Doo and the Adventure World from LEGO Dimensions is a real nostalgic trip as you explore, collect items and solve puzzles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Shaggy can track, illuminate and use stealth abilities. His trio of mystery based vehicles start out capable of using accelerator switches, then adds a tow bar, the third build drops the tow bar ability in favor of water spray which lets you fill up containers, douse fires, grow plants, and clean up toxic spills.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Scooby is loaded with a lot of useful abilities, he can also track and use stealth, but he is one of the only characters capable of diving underwater to dig and is necessary for a few puzzles because of this. His toy the Scooby-Snack can also grant three additional abilities depending on which version you&rsquo;ve built, the first snack can give you super strength so you can smash cracked LEGO objects, the second snack gives you laser vision so you can destroy Gold LEGO objects and the third snack is a bit redundant as it makes you invisible so you can sneak past stealth areas&hellip; redundant because Scooby and Shaggy already have this ability naturally, but it does mean anyone can eat the snack and gain the stealth ability in a pinch.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">One other thing both can do is gliding, an ability that isn&rsquo;t used to solve puzzles or anything like that, it just allows them to jump off and float down from high places while traveling in the adventure worlds.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This again is a must have pack if you want to finish everything in-game, Scooby is needed for some puzzles and you can&rsquo;t access the adventure world without it. So again I find myself recommending the set, the overall offering in physical toys is pretty fun even if the snack is a bit ho-hum compared to the Mystery Machine, and the in-game content is pretty great too with a load of references to Scooby-Doo history. Without a Scrappy in sight. Strongly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
