"8BrickMario","2016-01-05T14:34:52.703Z","The Enrichment Center must inform you that monetary contribution is a requirement for progress. ","<p>One of the biggest surprises of LEGO Dimensions is that <em>Portal</em>&nbsp;would join its list of franchises. Does the game do it justice?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The Dimensions sets have a unique trapezoidal package with an inverted trapezoid for the backing, which includes the shelf hook. This allows two same-sized packs to be stacked upside-down while taking up the same amount of space. The instructions are rudimentary, telling you how to assemble Chell only.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some very nice parts here, with the most notable being the portal gun. The piece is cast out of rubber to keep it from breaking, but its material makes it incrediby difficult to put in Chell&#39;s hand, and it cannot be rotated once it is. It neatly fits a simulated light piece in the end, which can be switched out for an orange one depending on which portal she&#39;s shooting. Another nice piece I&#39;ve wanted for a while is a solitary heart crystal, more common in the minidoll themes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Chell is a very nice figure. I&#39;m not sure her hair is a very good choice, as it&#39;s combed differently and longer in the back, but it&#39;s alright. Her face accurately represents her default stoic expression, and her alternate face shows her angered or annoyed, perhaps by Wheatley, as seen in-game. Her torso is nicely printed with her Aperture Science top, and her legs continue the uniform with the dual-molded technique showing orange shorts&nbsp;and white&nbsp;boots.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The builds were pretty easy, due to their size.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The builds in this pack are pretty nice. First is the famous Weighted Companion Cube. The base for the cube includes mainly filler parts used in the upgraded models, but the cube itself is nice, despite the inability to make it a perfect&nbsp;cube shape. The five sides with the recognizable heart design are printed. Interestingly, the top of the cube with two of the sides can come off fairly easily, due to using a jumper tile to keep it on. I haven&#39;t rebuilt it, so I don&#39;t know if the jumper is more important in the later models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other model is the Sentry Turret, one of many hazards in Aperture Science. It manages to look exactly like a turret from the game without too many pieces. However, its back leg is rather poor and would be better represented by another one of the front legs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>In-game, Chell is a bit specialized, being the only one who can create portals on designated panels. She is also acrobatic, but while I enjoy her inclusion, you&#39;ll only really need her for portal creation. Her Companion Cube retains its purpose of weighing down certain switches. It can be used by anyone;&nbsp;most will carry it, looking like they&#39;re hurting their back, but Chell&nbsp;will levitate it with her portal gun, just like in the original games. The Turret is useful for the primary reason of activating turret switches, which require the rapid-fire blasts of the turret to keep working.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Portal 2 level itself is a lot of fun. Almost all of the puzzles involve&nbsp;classic&nbsp;<em>Portal</em>&nbsp;game mechanics, such as switches, gels, the Companion Cube, and of course, the titular portals. The story is pretty basic, with Chell and co. (omitted from cutscenes) traveling through Aperture to get to GLaDOS, while accompanied by Wheatley. The humor is a blend of GLaDOS&#39; trademark sarcasm and LEGO&#39;s traditional silliness, and the amount of references packed into the level is great. The Aperture Science world is also pretty fun, though perhaps a bit tricky to navigate, and in true Aperture fashion, it tests every ability in the game, requiring several characters to solve all of the &quot;tests&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is probably the best level pack in the game so far. It introduces a new franchise that works surprisingly well with LEGO, and the gameplay provided is very enjoyable. &nbsp;I would definitely recommend this to anyone who plays Dimensions and especially to the&nbsp;<em>Portal</em>&nbsp;fans who do so.</p>

"GBP_Chris","2016-04-29T19:31:52.16Z","Cave Johnson would have fired someone over this atrocity","<p>I&#39;m a longtime Portal fan. Played Portal and Portal 2, Aperture Tag, and am working through Portal Stories and Half-Life. I&#39;m also a longtime Lego fan, never had a dark age and spent my days MOCing and brickfilming. So when I found my two favorite things were going to combine into one, I was ecstatic! A Lego Chell? A Lego Portal gun?</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this set is atrocious. I almost regret buying it except for the fact that I never return Lego sets.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I understand this is part of a game, but I don&#39;t appreciate the lack of instructions for the turret and cube in the box. Had to look these up separately online.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts assortment is way too small for a USD $30.00 set. At a measly 85 pieces, there are a few highlights. A lot of helpful white slopes and some rarities - transparent blue shields, black short sticks, even the printed tiles of the Companion Cube are nice. The portal gun, however, is a flimsy rubber piece I fear will suffer abrasion if even touched.</p>

<p>For those who ever bought a Lego Agents set and watched as Dr. Inferno&#39;s hairpiece lost the orange texture on the rubber, I would like you to apply that fear to the white texture on the portal gun.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Chell is a decent minifigure,&nbsp;but I would have appreciated some kind of piece to represent her Aperture jacket wrapped around her waist. That, and her face just doesn&#39;t seem to match the game much - it&#39;s too angry and annoyed. Chell in Portal and Portal 2 has more of a neutral expression that just doesn&#39;t come across here.</p>

<p>Her stand is cool - I like the Aperture logo.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Companion Cube is awful. Such a terribly built cube - the Lego dice from the Lego Games line would have made a better substitute for the awful array of plates and tiles used to construct this abomination. It resembles the in-game item&nbsp;but has about as much thought put into it as&nbsp;75098 Assault on Hoth. Yeah, it&#39;s that bad.</p>

<p>The Turret remains a joke between my friend and I to this day. It is ridiculously oversized and looks like GLaDOS tried to implement a new inflatable turret design. For those who have not played the game, a turret is the size of a normal human being and a lot slimmer. It resembles a turret, but to say anything more would be a disgrace to Cave Johnson&#39;s good name.</p>

<p>I have not played the game as I do not have Lego Dimensions, so I will restrict this review to the set. That is why I bought it - to have some kind of Portal Lego representation.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Am I being too harsh? My aforementioned friend likewise bought the Back To The Future pack, which he displays prominently next to his Ideas DeLorean. Those models are beautiful and very well represent the elements from the movie. Plus, they allow for people without the Dimensions game to appreciate the models.</p>

<p>This Portal pack, however, deserves a trip down the incinerator.</p>

<p>The models are hideous, the price is atrocious, the pieces have their own problems, and I have no doubt that Cave Johnson is rolling in his grave over this right now. Perhaps Lego will be able to rectify the situation and&nbsp;make a better Portal set of some sort. For the people who are still alive ...</p>

Not functional arms mind you, but the profile of the model as you build it really looks odd and takes up too much space when you attach it to the base.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Flying Turret Carrier changes the entire design a lot more to expand and allow for Minifigures to actually sit on top. I feel the Sentry Turret and Flying Turret Carrier are the stronger of the two models, both of them are quite strongly put together and both function the best as models. They also look better than the middle form due to the design being better executed. (In my opinion.)</span></span></span></span></p>

The big difference between that model and these is that each of these includes far more pieces and manages to look quite nice in either form. The Companion Cube itself is a square hovering on top of some extra parts, Laser Deflector takes the shield element and incorporates them into the cube design to &lsquo;deflect&rsquo; lasers. The final model adds more elements onto the basic cube design and that&rsquo;s pretty much all there is to say about this trio of models.</span></span></span></span></p>
