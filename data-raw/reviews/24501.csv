"8BrickMario","2016-01-05T15:57:21.087Z","Get it while there's still time! You don't have a TARDIS, after all. ","<p>One of the most exciting additions to Dimensions was&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who,&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;here respresented by Peter Capaldi&#39;s Twelfth Doctor. How does it fare?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The boxes for the line are rather nice, although I can&#39;t say I like the render of the Doctor on the top of the box. The instructions are practically pointless, but if you can&#39;t put together a minifigure, they&#39;re there for you.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some nice pieces in this set, with the most notable being the sonic screwdriver and hair (also in the Ideas set) and the printed tiles for K-9 and the TARDIS&nbsp;doors.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This version of the Twelfth&nbsp;Doctor in his standard outfit is exclusive. His head shows a stern expression, representing his personality pretty well, and the hair works nicely for him, even though it&#39;s been simultaneously designed to work for Dr. Peter&nbsp;Venkman. His torso and legs show his dark blue suit with the red accents, and his NFC base is decorated to match.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Again, the build is simple, but uses some nice techniques.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The first model you build is K-9, the Doctor&#39;s robotic dog companion from the early seasons of the show. I think he looks superb, and is instantly recognizable. The TARDIS is the second build, perched upon a rocky terrain. The build here is more simple, but it still looks good. In-game, the TARDIS is larger, using a 4x4 footprint.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>The Doctor is a very useful character in the game, being able to hack technological panels, repair broken blue mechanisms, and shatter glass objects with his sonic screwdriver. After completing the level from this pack, the Doctor will go through his cycle of regenerations when he dies, cycling from the First Doctor, all the way to the Twelfth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>K-9 and the TARDIS can both be upgraded to fire gold-cutting/melting lasers, and the TARDIS itself can be used to drop cargo into designated places&nbsp;and activate jet switches. The main draw for the TARDIS is its ability to travel through time and space to different areas. You can access its interior, though the control panel&nbsp;can only be used while playing as the Doctor, and the appearance of the interior is different based on which version of the Doctor you currently are. In the Doctor Who world, you can use the console inside to travel to the different areas, while you can also choose which regeneration you wish to play as. Certain platforms will also take the TARDIS to new areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The level&#39;s gameplay is pretty unique. The plot is that Davros is attacking London in the future with the Dalek forces, and the gameplay focuses on traveling between different time periods to alter the reality in the future and allow you to solve puzzles (a similar mechanic is used in the&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future</em>&nbsp;world. &nbsp;Some new enemies not present in the story level also appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The adventure world is also unique, with the first goal being to connect all of the areas of the world. You need to destroy &quot;dimensional discombobulators&quot; to fuse the worlds of 2015 London, 19th century London, Trenzalore, Mars, Skaro, and Telos. Doing so will provide better navigation, and allow you to access more tasks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of value in this level pack. The experience is definitely going to be more worthwhile to serious&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>&nbsp;fans (which I am not), but it&#39;s still enjoyable and worth your time to get it.&nbsp;</p>

The base isn&rsquo;t as built up with this version of the model.</span></span></span></span></p>

I suppose that&rsquo;s the joy of LEGO models. I do prefer the base build for this model though simply because it isn&rsquo;t as cluttered, and it does offer some better display options for the Tardis as a whole.</span></span></span></span></p>

It can be detached from the base and be added to the interior of the Tardis from the Doctor Who Ideas set for an additional displayable character.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a bit silly looking as you construct it, but honestly it could be worse, it could be like the silly Hoverboard. At least this build actually has a build to discuss.</span></span></span></span></p>

I think my favorites though are the original Tardis and the Energy Burst Tardis, the second model just looks a bit silly with those laser blaster cylinders on the top, considering it doesn&rsquo;t really look like what a Tardis should look like.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s an extensive adventure taking full advantage of the time travel element for the Tardis and The Doctor&rsquo;s unique sense of humour. The Twelfth Doctor was recorded officially for all the lines, and there&rsquo;s even a LEGO version of the opening theme, it&rsquo;s a great love letter to the greatest creation of the BBC.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s also a very solid pack with some nice nods to Doctor Who lore and past adventures. The only downside in my opinion is the fact that K-9 just doesn&rsquo;t work very well as a toy in-game, he has redundant abilities and the builds are all very weak after you start rebuilding it from the main model.</span></span></span></span></p>

When it isn&rsquo;t falling over on its side due to in-game glitches. Still the minor flaws are more than made up for by the entire package and I stand by my recommendation. For players of LEGO Dimensions this is a must have pack.</span></span></span></span></p>
