"8BrickMario","2016-01-06T15:13:04.23Z","Is this a ""do"" or a ""D'oh""nt?","<p>To be honest, my primary reason for getting this pack was because it was a level pack, and thus, beneficial to completion. Was I pleasantly surprised?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are pretty nice, with the pink and lavender being less common colors in non-minidoll themes. The Buzz Cola can and soda top are also nice parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Homer here has been seen before, but he&#39;s still a good representation of the character.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fairly easy, with the most interesting technique being the cab of the car.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The two builds look pretty nice, with both being recognizable models. I think my favorite build is the Mecha-Homer upgrade of the television. So creative!</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>...and this is where it falls short for me.</p>

<p>Due to the characters I own, Homer is completely redundant to me. His abilities are to break glass with a sonic belch, and to grow with rage to use super strength. I find Wonder Woman and the Doctor to cover these abilities, with more on both sides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car itself is actually pretty nice, as it&#39;s able to pull down weak walls with purple hooks without being upgraded (unlike the Batmobile), but I don&#39;t find myself using it much.</p>

<p>The television&#39;s main function is to distract enemies so you can get past. Again, not incredibly useful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The level itself is okay, being a recreation of &quot;The Mysterious Voyage of Homer&quot;. If you have the TARDIS, there&#39;s a cameo from another classic animated sitcom. The level itself is nice due to its dreamlike environment, but like the&nbsp;<em>Back to the Future</em>&nbsp;pack, I would have preferred an original story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Adventure World that owning Homer gave me access to is pretty nice. I like the softer, more cartoony style of Springfield, and there are all of the important locations. I&#39;ve noticed a bizarre trend with these worlds to include tunnel systems and underwater areas, but they just add to the exploration.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is probably the weakest of all of the Level Packs, offering no exclusive gameplay mechanics, and having the least useful character and models. If you&#39;re not concerned about completing all of the levels, I&#39;d recommend getting Bart or Krusty instead.&nbsp;</p>

The build is relatively simple to follow along with, and uses all the same parts as the car only in a different configuration. LEGO did a good job making these designs incorporate all of the same parts so you don&rsquo;t have to leave any off when building them.</span></span></span></span></p>

I will admit though I haven&rsquo;t rebuilt any of the primary models in physical form yet, I follow along with the instructions, but I haven&rsquo;t actually built any of them. They look great though, for what the designers were aiming at with these figures.</span></span></span></span></p>

And honestly it&rsquo;s the weakest idea out of the entire set. It doesn&rsquo;t really fit too well as something Simpsons related, it&rsquo;s just odd-ball whacky cartoon inspired, like something out of Looney Tunes or something. Could be worse though.</span></span></span></span></p>

Using one of the well-known and enjoyable early season Simpsons episodes for the basis of the level, we find a lot of interesting things to do and explore as you experience the famous Chili Cook-Off Insanity Peppers episode of The Simpsons.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Archive Footage was used for the dialogue in The Simpsons, thus Johnny Cash became a character in LEGO Dimensions as Homer&rsquo;s Spirit Guide. The level is very detailed and full of fun references, unfortunately because Archival Footage was used there are no new lines from Dan Castellaneta, and as I may have mentioned in the Starter Pack review, the Theme song is absent. Instead a sound-alike theme was used for the Level and the Adventure World and it just sounds awful. I mean it&rsquo;s trying to be in keeping with the show, but damn does it come off as grating and annoying.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Also none of the other characters from Springfield get any dialogue lines, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Mr. Burns, Smithers, anybody not voiced by Dan Castellaneta is not&nbsp;allowed to use archival footage and so effectively the Town of Springfield is completely mute. Krusty, Abe, Diamond Joe Quimby and Homer are the only characters with lines, we don&rsquo;t even get to hear Apu&rsquo;s famous Thank You, Come Again&hellip; it is a huge let-down considering there are a lot of fans of the Simpsons and folks would have probably enjoyed this level and adventure world a lot better if it was as lively and enjoyable as the actual cartoon show.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;d suggest muting the world though or swapping to a different track using the Jukebox because after hours of exploring this Adventure World you&rsquo;ll be sick and tired of that fake knock-off Simpsons Theme song.</span></span></span></span></p>

And of course as Giant Homer he can access and smash Cracked LEGO Objects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Homer&rsquo;s Car has access to Accelerator Switches, as is the case with most ground vehicles, and the Tow Bar ability. Switching to the Homercraft gives you the ability to sail on water while the SubmaHomer dives under water and can destroy Silver LEGO objects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">His Taunt-O-Vision can blow up Silver LEGO Objects and has the unique ability to Taunt Enemies, which basically means it attracts them. The Blast Cam can be ridden like a turret and operates as a Special Weapon, which I believe means it grants you more attack power, the MechaHomer allows you to destroy Gold LEGO Objects, overall a sadly weak number of virtual abilities that makes this particular set of in-game models rather pointless aside from the point where you build it inside the Simpsons Level.</span></span></span></span></p>

On top of that the Mock Theme is terrible, it&rsquo;s a bouncy up-beat tune that sounds like nails on a chalkboard after thirty minutes and it will take you at least that long to get through every puzzle and trick in the Level, then you&rsquo;ve got an hour&rsquo;s worth of exploring to do in the Adventure World, and unlike with Back to the Future they didn&rsquo;t include different music tracks, just the one annoying fake Simpsons Theme for the duration. A terrible licensing deal, but what can you expect where greed is concerned.</span></span></span></span></p>

All-in-all I can mildly recommend this one for that reason alone, if Dimensions doesn&rsquo;t interest you in the slightest you won&rsquo;t be missing out much on anything should you choose to skip this one.</span></span></span></span></p>
