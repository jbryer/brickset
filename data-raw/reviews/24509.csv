<p>Parts - It comes with two trans blue pieces.&nbsp; And a 2x2 brick with&nbsp;groves on the sides (I do not have to many of thoes). &nbsp;Are the parts worth noting.</p>

<p>Mini-figure - A basic white figure with &quot;space printing&quot; on the front and back. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The build - Not to hard should only take ten&nbsp;minutes max to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model - A space buggy that probably should go with other sets. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion - The biggest complaint about the set is the Antenna/Radar Dish&nbsp;with the Mini-Figure sitting in the buggy it can not rotate fully. &nbsp;It should of have a longer stick so the &quot;dish&quot; can rotate freely. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"CrescentSky","2015-12-28T16:59:17.757Z","Back To The Basics","<p>I got this set as a gift long after it hit the checkout isle at Target. despite not having many other space sets, I can say it&#39;s a nice accent to any other modern space exploration sets. Anyway, on to the review.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Standard ploybag&nbsp;with folded instruction sheet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a few noteworthy parts in this set, like the trans-blue large&nbsp;dish piece and the 2x2 grey brick with grooves the dish is mounted on. The wheels and axle pieces &nbsp;are also relatively new and nice to get.&nbsp;For such a small set, I am impressed with how many uncommon and useful parts are included.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The astronaut minifig included is nothing special, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s bad. it appears in all other space sets this year, but is well printed and has good detail.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was extremely simple, probably taking me two minutes at most, but that is not to say it wasn&#39;t enjoyable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model looks well made and is fairly sturdy, although the hinges used for the dish and sensor could use some more friction.I think it would look very good with 60080 spaceport.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this set is great. for its price, what you get is excellent. it is very reminiscent&nbsp;of what made lego space... well, lego space. I think kids would really like this if they are into the space theme.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:46:51.427Z","Weakest Offering of this Sub-Theme.","<p><strong>Set #30315 Space Utility Vehicle: </strong>Here&rsquo;s a Polybag for the Space Sub-Theme of LEGO City, is it good? Read on for the pros and cons then we&rsquo;ll discuss the overall thoughts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Astronaut Minifigure looks good. Double-sided torso is great, helmet piece is standard for deep sea LEGO divers and space faring astronauts.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model is quick to build.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is slightly cramped, while it captures the likeness of a moon buggy, or the like, rather nicely it is a bit smaller than I would care for and the large satellite dish sticks out as being far too large for such a craft.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price-per-piece ratio not ideal.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>While this fits in nicely with the space sub-theme of LEGO city as a decent looking little vehicle to join the larger sets, I feel it&rsquo;s a bit lackluster due to the design of the model. It just doesn&rsquo;t work the best in my opinion, I understand that as a matter of opinion this can be up for debate. However I&rsquo;d say this set just isn&rsquo;t worth hunting down if you missed it, the larger sets from this theme are much better.</p>

"vikings","2020-06-08T06:59:46.723Z","Space Utility Vehicle","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few nice pieces in this set. You get the trans blue space dish, the four tires and rims are nice and look great and work well for this space vehicle. The total piece count for the set is 39. Overall a decent piece haul for a polybag.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Astronaut:</strong></p>

<p>The astronaut is an okay figure to get. He has a white space helmet with a gold visor. The head is pretty simple and somewhat common. He has a slight smile on his face (which doesn&#39;t really matter since you can&#39;t see with the helmet on anyway). He has printing on both sides of his torso showing his space suit. The front shows the bottom of the neck line of the space suit with the light grey belt and respirator with the space logo on it on the front of the torso. On the back you have the light grey belt and the space logo in the middle of the torso. He has plain white legs and has no accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is another good Lego city polybag. The space buggy itself&nbsp;looks pretty good. The large satellite and (to what I believe is) solar panel add to the utility part of the name. There is a printed 1x2 tile with three gauges on it. The vehicle moves nicely on hard surfaces with ease. The large satellite dish is too low and when you move it around it gets stuck when the astronaut is driving it. The astronaut is pretty good and the printing on the torso is good. Overall this is a good Lego city polybag. I recommend this to a Lego city fan, but this isn&#39;t a must-have to add to your Lego collection if you are not. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.</p>

"Nouri","2015-12-30T21:18:08.623Z","A Nice Compliment to an Amazing Subtheme!","<p>Hello fellow LEGO, Space, and polybag lovers! Today I bring you my review of the <em>Space Utility Vehicle</em> set, a decent polybag with great functionality when paired with other sets.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a very standard polybag&nbsp;size which is typical of most polybags of today. The instructions are a small folded up piece of paper that is once again very typical of todays generation of polybags. As always, with such a small set the instructions are very easy to lose due to&nbsp;how small they are. Other than that, nothing too special about the instructions or polybag here!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Utility Vehicle in itself comes with some fairly common parts as well as it&#39;s share of slightly rarer parts. Most notably, the trans-blue antennae dish as well as 2 x 2 smooth blue piece situated on the back of the astronauts viewfinder are very welcome to any part collectors. The other pieces while being fairly common could be used to make your own custom buggy or any small scale sort of vehicle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As the sole driver of the vehicle, this set comes with one minifigure. The minifigure, an astronaut very common of the 2015 space theme, is very welcome in any space lovers collection as astronauts and realistic space sets are very few and far between. The astronaut comes with a generic space suit that is mostly covered up by the large helmet which serves as the astronauts protection from radiation while operating in space.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Simple build, not much to say here. Comprised mainly of a small frame with added wheels and antennae.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model consists of a buggy-like looking vehicle that could easily pass as a space utility vehicle. Alone, the buggy doesn&#39;t server much purpose and isn&#39;t very impressive as a stand alone model. However, when paired with other space sets such as <em>Set 60080 Spaceport</em> (http://brickset.com/sets/60080-1/Spaceport) it serves as a nice extra element to add to the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A pretty average polybag with some nice playability and functionality when paired with other space sets. It also adds a nice touch of realism to other space sets that may compliment it. Overall if you want this set to work nicely it needs to be paired with other space sets. Other than that it&#39;s just an average polybag!</p>

"Studded_Dud","2020-08-10T05:06:16.377Z","Flat Base Buggy","<p>Build: As space buggy&#39;s go they never look very good, so this one fits right in. It has a pretty flat base and a few parts that stick up. The first part that sticks up is the light. It isn&#39;t in the best spot, it can twist around but if the astronaut is sitting down then it swings into him. The second part that sticks up is the antenna. It looks a little out of place because it is just about as big as the buggy itself. It can swing around but it also hits the astronaut. Both things that swing around can move up and down also.</p>

<p>Parts: This set includes 39 pieces which for a polybag isn&#39;t too bad. The piece that stands out the most is by far the radar piece on the antenna. There is a steering wheel and a round 2x2 piece with studs on the top.</p>

<p>Playability: The play functions that the buggy offers have complications. The&nbsp;main two are the things that stick up but as before mentioned they both end up hitting the driver. The wheels spin and the steering wheel can also spin.</p>

<p>Value for Money: This set originally cost&nbsp;$3.99 as most polybags do. For 39 pieces I think that it is a decent value.</p>

<p>Minifig: The minifigure is a basic astronaut. His face is a basic happy face. The legs are plain white but the torso has the printing of an astronaut. The helmet is the basic astronaut helmet which has no need for an update. The helmet has great detail and a gold visor that clips onto it.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall for a polybag it&#39;s not too bad but the vehicle has a few play functions that get blocked when there is a driver. The wheels spin nicely but that doesn&#39;t make up for the fact that the buggy is as flat as can be. But in the end because of the flat base this gets 3/5.</p>
