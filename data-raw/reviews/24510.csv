<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard fair - excellent quality and easy to follow</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of gray with a smattering of black</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Excellent - all are brilliantly executed, some of the best from any of the 50+ star wars sets we have&nbsp;!!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I own over a 100 sets in multiple themes and for the piece count this was the best experience, the design is for me by far the best ship I have build outside an ultimate collectors model&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Brilliant - walks all over the previous models by a country mile. Playability factor is easily a 5/5 - my son has not stopped swooshing it round his bedroom</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Excellent set for which I cannot recommend highly enough to anyone hesitating about buying this set - it made me write my first review&nbsp;</p>
