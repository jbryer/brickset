"Slobrojoe","2020-01-17T07:51:36.58Z","An excellent Chima add-on","<p>This set was released with a magazine in May and July 2015. And will&nbsp;be reasonably hard to find now.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>This set was released in a poly bag. It contained no instructions as they were included in the magazine.</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>There were no minifigs.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This includes some really nice translucent blue and red parts to represent Fire and Ice weapons as shown in the TV program.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>To build the model it requires some fishing around in the magazine. When you find them, the build is quite simple. It teaches different methods to make weapons using cool pieces.</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Really nice fire and ice pieces</p>

<p>-Can fit any Chima&nbsp;character</p>

<p>-Has a variety of weapon sizes</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Exclusive to May-June 2015</p>

<p>-No minifig</p>

<p>Overall, this is a very handy set to have if you need to arm troops for battle. However, this set was exclusive and now not many people own it and it goes for high prices. The Lego Chima range was supposed to take over Ninjago&nbsp;but ended off shelves and is now no longer available in shops.</p>
