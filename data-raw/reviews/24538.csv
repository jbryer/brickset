I would guess it is closer to 50 cm in length, and over 30 cm in wingspan. The wing-part doesn&#39;t even fit in my usual lego storage boxes. It is really MASSIVE, and finished it spans the entire area of the box. Since the price is quite high, and people might compare it to the Private Jet, they&nbsp;don&#39;t think it is enough value. I thought so too until I bought it on sale and built it. It is larger than even my boyfriends large Technic units, and twice as long as the Private Jet.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>One instruction book which I really enjoy. I thought the box was mostly air but when I picked it up it was quite heavy, and as I said: the plane was even bigger than the box!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The airplane parts are gigantic! They make space for a lot of customization inside the plane. Also there is a gorgeous little printed&nbsp;keyboard 2x1 plate for the check-in computer. So cute!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three of them, nothing special.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took me 4 hours to build. Could probably have done it faster but I really wanted to enjoy the build and appreciate every step and seeing the airplane grow. I clicks together with technic pins and is quite a simple build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>HUGE. And so well furnished inside! However the little food trolley just tips over and has no natural place to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The airport is way to small (and has no liquor in the tax free shop lol).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not sure I would recommend buying it on full price, but if you see it on sale, go for it! It will probably surprise you.&nbsp;</p>
