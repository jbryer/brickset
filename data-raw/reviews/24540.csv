<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions were easy to follow (of course) and included instructions on doing numbers 0-9.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are fun and has extra for being able to change the numbers out with each passing birthday or whatever number you want to put on there.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure is a jester which is only the torso. But he has two faces, one happy and one crying which is great fun for me as after a certain age we tend to hate birthdays!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun. Took about an hour (but it takes me longer as I sort out all the pieces). It was interesting to see how they used certain parts to make it come together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is FUN! The Jester &quot;pops&quot; out of the cake with a push of the button so there are two ways to display this..(three if you change out the way the facial expression is).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I enjoyed this set. I really feel like it was worth the price I paid and is something to be enjoyed changing out over the years. Great for displaying on the table for birthdays, and on the bookcase/wherever you normally display , for many years.</p>
