"KingAlanI","2016-02-01T05:40:55.54Z","Great bargain on a cool little model","<p>This is the first Pop Star set I bought to go with 41104 Dressing Room. This can be found cheaply and in quantity.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The bag seemed bigger than necessary for the contents.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The trophy and microphone were cool special pieces, and there were lots of rare colors of regular pieces, along with a few common colors.&nbsp;The accessories are quite easily combined with other Friends sets and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Having a LEGO person in such a small set really adds to the value. The hair is brown, though it appears black on the bag. The curlyness goes well with the black skin, both are good variety in and of themselves.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Almost a moot point on a set this small</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Nice and compact</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-31T22:32:40.513Z","Andrea Recieving a Reward, Not Livi?","<p><strong>Set #30205 Pop Star Red Carpet: </strong>Never has a name for a set been more misleading than this one. More of a stage than a &lsquo;red carpet&rsquo; this set is part of the Pop Star Sub-Theme and doesn&rsquo;t include the new character, but Andrea instead. We&rsquo;ll go over all the pros and cons of the polybag before given a summary, however I can safely say right now, while it is horribly misnamed it is no less impressive for what is included.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model in this set is a small stage of varying colours, dark purple and pink plates are used as well as light orange. Two clear 1x2 bricks are used for the podium on the stage and include a microphone and trophy/award.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model is very nice. Includes a separate camera on stand for televising the event being depicted here.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Andrea Mini-Doll included appears to be unique to this set. Includes a light orange skirt and white t-shirt with musical note necklace print. She looks quite nice actually and the necklace print is suitable for her character.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>No Livi, for a set in the Pop Star Sub-Theme it would have been nice if she was included in such a cheap set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Stage model not entirely original, similar to other builds in the Theme.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Not a fan of the trophy, personal opinion it looks tacky, and the use of the telescope piece with a star shaped cookie/stud just doesn&rsquo;t stand out as a trophy should.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a fun little polybag, however unlike some of the other Friends Polybags this is the first time I hesitate to recommend buying it. If you could get it as a free promotion in your area still than by all means, do so, however I feel like there&rsquo;s just something missing from this particular Polybag compared to some of the more innovative and impressive sets from this Theme. I do like the colour choices here though.</p>
