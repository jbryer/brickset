"Tediousity","2017-07-04T18:39:10.49Z","Not Too Shabby","<p>It&#39;s a nice fun pack. Not exceedingly fantastic, but you get what you ask for. Allow me to explain.</p>

<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p>The one figure included in this set is (of course) Aquaman himself: Arthur Curry, king of the seas. He&#39;s nicely detailed, with his trademark orange-scale shirt, green gloves, golden belt, and green pants all included. This is the same version of Aquaman we&#39;ve had in the past, so sorry, but nothing new there. However, this was my first time coming in contact with the figure and I really like it. One thing to note is that while the torso is fabulously detailed, there is no such printing on the legs and they are plain green, and though I dislike this, I really can&#39;t see how that could be avoided, as there&#39;s nothing else to put on there. I&#39;d give Aquaman a 4.5/5 overall.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The main interesting parts of this pack (not including the bases) are the tridents. This set comes with two: one for Aquaman to hold and one for the engine of the &quot;Aqua Watercraft&quot;. It also has two orange flippers and two in lime green. The last thing of note here is the transparent blue flame pieces, forming the jets of the watercraft. Overall, 3-4/5.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build...well, to be honest, I just guessed at it from the packaging and I think I got it pretty well, although there is a classic-looking laser gun piece that I have no idea where it fits. A fair bit of SNOT here and the flippers were cleverly used to bridge the distance between the clips on the sides and the main body. I&#39;m giving this a 4/5.</p>

<p><strong>In-Game Experience</strong></p>

<p>As my copy of the base game is still shipping, I can&#39;t give very good information here. However, I know Aquaman has a useful skill set including Hazard Cleanup, Dive, and the unique Atlantis Pools ability, and I look forward to swimming around the Atlantis part of the DC open world with him.</p>

<p>Aquaman unlocks no new levels or adventure worlds, but due to the remaining content of the pack, I&#39;ll still have to recommend him--though not if you don&#39;t own the game and already own Aquaman.</p>

Some elements are used as cheats instead of unique parts, but other than that the model is built quickly and looks quite promising.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Seven Seas Speeder: This model represents a submarine build that is meant to resemble a crustacean if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. The builds all evoke some kind of sea creature and look fairly interesting while relying on the same parts. This model is a closer match when built to the design seen in-game.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Trident of Fire: I feel this model might just be the best of the bunch. It&rsquo;s simple, fun and very impressive as far as the build goes making an interesting and unique little micro-build submarine.</span></span></span></span></p>

The initial build has vibes of a Manta or Sting Ray, the SSS has a definite crab or possibly other shelled crustacean design though not lobster and the ToF looks like an actual fish with a moving tail and everything. All three builds are fairly decent and mostly resemble their digital counterparts. I&rsquo;m torn on which one I&rsquo;d like to see on the toy tag permanently, but as I noted above the Trident of Fire is one of the best. The Aqua Watercraft is a fairly close second though. I feel the Seven Seas Speeder is the weakest as it relies on parts that are a tad off for what you&rsquo;re trying to build.</span></span></span></span></p>

I kind of wish they had created unique areas of the Adventure World that could expand it into a larger world with more iconic areas similar to how LEGO Batman 3 had numerous planets to visit opening up more and more hub worlds to visit.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Aquaman is needed for a specific type of puzzle known on the ability wheel as Atlantis, with it he can communicate with sea creatures at certain pools to summon bricks to build a brick-creature to solve some kind of puzzle in an area where the Atlantis pools are located.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">His other abilities are Dive, Hazard Cleaner and Growth. Fairly uncommon abilities. The Aqua Watercraft can Dive and travel on the water, the Seven Seas Speeder has a Special Weapon and can use Speed Boost and the Trident of Fire has a Special Attack and can Destroy LEGO Silver Objects. Overall not much to the abilities, but perfectly serviceable for what they are.</span></span></span></span></p>

He is the only one who can do this, I believe. All of the builds are fairly nice and the Digital Content isn&rsquo;t that disappointing for the abilities at least. If you want the entire Justice League you want this set, so I&rsquo;d recommend it. Highly recommended for folks who want to do everything and solve all the puzzles in-game also. Otherwise it is safe to skip.</span></span></span></span></p>
