I&rsquo;m going to change my usual thoughts here though because of one simple fact, this is the only way to get the Bane Minifigure that was originally included in the now retired 2012 LEGO Batcave set and re-issuing it here was really perfect for fans who missed out on him back in the day.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bane is shown on the front of this package in digital artwork form as a Minifigure and most appropriately shows the shadow of his character when he&rsquo;s turned into a Big Fig, this is one of the better art images on the front of a Dimensions Fun Pack and looks great. The set images on the front and back are also very impressive.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">You get a few space blasters in this set as part of the vehicle and a nice printed Toy Tag for Bane, but it&rsquo;s really simple in the parts count without much to discuss compared to some of the other sets in the range. Speaking of which I really wish LEGO would continue making LEGO Dimensions inspired Polybag sets with the Toy Tags, just don&rsquo;t include any digital information or RTF Chips in the sets so people won&rsquo;t mistake them for original Dimensions sets, because builds like this at 4.99$ would be awesome.</span></span></span></span></p>

The printing on this Minifigure is exactly identical to that figure with a bare chested torso with double-sided printing and the dark mask with venom hose visible on the back. He has no hand-held accessories, but you can build up the venom infuser with some bricks attached to a bracket around his neck.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Drill Driver: This miniature version of the larger drill vehicle from 2012 using two space blaster elements for the engines, it&rsquo;s a very quick and fun build and can be removed from the toy tag for fun play.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bane Dig &lsquo;n Drill: The basic lower build for this model is very similar to the first model, all of the parts are rearranged to make a small drilling implement so you can pretend to dig. This build should involve only a little bit of parts removal, you shouldn&rsquo;t have to disassemble everything from the first model when building it. Which is unique and not often seen between builds.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bane Drill &lsquo;n Blast: This final model makes an equally different looking vehicle out of the same parts, it&rsquo;s truly amazing how this set manages to give you something different with each rebuild and I honestly think it&rsquo;s one of the stronger sets because of this.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

You can play with all three of them as small vehicle builds, Minifigures cannot ride on them; however you can easily see them as remote control drones when put next to Minifigures. A trio of decidedly solid vehicles that I honestly can&rsquo;t tell what is the best from this set because each one is very well designed.</span></span></span></span></p>

A pity they didn&rsquo;t add anything else for them to unlock from the start, it would have made much better value for each pack if they had something else to unlock like bonus missions or something.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Bane has Hazard Protection can destroy Cracked LEGO Objects and has a Big Transformation into his Big Fig form digitally.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Drill Driver is one of only two toys capable of accessing the Drill ability, only Emmet and this vehicle can drill, it can also Dig. The secondary model adds the Tow-Bar ability on top of the Drilling and Digging abilities. The third model keeps the two main powers but swaps Tow-Bar for Destroy Silver LEGO Objects and adds a Special Attack. Some good abilities for this set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As I noted above I consider this set a must have for DC Super Hero Minifigure collectors because it brings back the original 2012 Bane Minifigure which is in a retired set. As I write this review LEGO Dimensions is also retired unfortunately so the secondary market is the only way that you can get it. I&rsquo;d still recommend this set, especially if you&rsquo;d prefer to ignore Emmet because Bane&rsquo;s vehicle can access the drill ability. It may be a bit more awkward to use in-game, but it&rsquo;s an option. Definitely recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
