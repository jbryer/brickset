In LEGO form he&rsquo;s a decent addition to any team, unfortunately this Fun Pack doesn&rsquo;t include much aside from the character himself.</span></span></span></span></p>

Nothing much else to say here.</span></span></span></span></p>

Wings, cheese slopes and the like are typically in different colours, so seeing them here is great.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Hover Pod: Giving Superman a vehicle is a bit of an odd decision, but the build for the initial model is fairly decent and uses a lot of fun elements to good effect. This is meant to be the ship Superman arrived on Earth on, and I can see that from the design.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Krypton Striker: This build for the secondary model is a bit unusual in its design and part placement; however it features some nice ideas though it could have been executed slightly better. Still I was satisfied with the build and it&rsquo;s still a fun toy to play with on or off the tag.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Super Stealth Pod: This third build makes what looks like a Kryptonite Cryo Chamber. It is designed to look slightly like the pod that Lois is placed into in Man of Steel, considering this the model is a fairly nice little build, if a bit lacking due to the need to use only one set of parts whereas the digital build seems a bit more coherent in its overall design.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Hover Pod &amp; Alternate Models: All three of these models, once built, are highly fun little vehicles to play around with. They don&rsquo;t 100% match their digital counterparts in some areas, but overall they are all three fairly impressive and decent enough for something to build. The only issue I have is why Superman needed a vehicle when he can already fly, even in space&hellip; granted earlier comics did not include this power from what I recall. That being said, it would have been relatively hard to find something suitable to make for him.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ultimately though it could have been worse. At least they do a good job with making a ship based around the life pod Jor-El used to send his son to Earth in the first place. I&rsquo;m not sure if it matches in-comic appearances of that craft, but it does look like LEGO Superman would have been inside this particular vehicle when he was sent to Earth.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The Digital Content</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Adventure World: It&rsquo;s another character granting access to the DC Adventure World, and I can&rsquo;t believe how superfluous this seems since Batman comes with the Starter Set so you should already have access to it, so why bother buying any of the ancillary sets from DC? Mostly for the Characters I&rsquo;d say.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Naturally, Superman is quite powerful. He has the iconic Flying ability with his own Theme song playing as he flies, until the tune cuts out for some reason after a while. He is Invulnerable, which means he can&rsquo;t die, has Laser and Freezing Breath can destroy Cracked LEGO Objects and can Dive under water. He also has the X-Ray Vision ability.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Hover Pod can interact with Flight Docks and Cargo Hooks, the secondary form of the Krypton Striker can do all of that and also has a Special Weapon while the Super Stealth Pod drops this ability in favor of Destroying Silver LEGO Objects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set is utterly pointless in most respects, and I&rsquo;m not saying that from a perspective of it being bad. No I mean this set is pointless because DC Adventure World is already unlocked with the Starter Pack and the other characters serve no real purpose in the game, some of them have certain puzzle solving abilities and their vehicles can be fun and interesting to see in action or play with in physical form.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">So I&rsquo;d recommend this set mostly for fans of Superman who wants him in their LEGO Dimensions game as a character. If you are only interested in unlocking everything Superman can easily be skipped. So to summarize Recommended to fans, otherwise skip it safely with no fear of missing something exclusive.</span></span></span></span></p>
