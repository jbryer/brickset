"AdamDaLegoGuy","2017-06-01T20:58:19.373Z","Great figure, not so great build","<p>MINIFIGURE:&nbsp;This is the&nbsp;only minifigure from the Ninjago line of Lego Dimensions that I see much value in. While I am not sure that he is exclusive, he definitely adds to the reason to buy this pack with his gorgeous, golden details on his torso and legs. If you don&#39;t have a Sensei Wu figure, now you do.</p>

<p>BUILD: The dragon is great looking, especially with the croissant piece used on the head. It actually just looks like a mini version of the full set for Wu&#39;s Dragon. The bad part about it is that it falls apart quite easily, and this will become especially annoying to those who simply store away their Lego dimensions items in a box or bag when not using them. Not to mention the fact that this is not the easiest build to remember and I can recall two or three times when I had to look up the online instructions.</p>

<p>OVERALL: Even though it isn&#39;t the most stable model, it looks great as a physical item and in game. Wu is a fun character to play as, with him being one of the fastest characters in the game, and his minifigure looks quite good.</p>

It&rsquo;s a highly solid looking model though.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Flying White and Golden Fire Dragons are really strong offerings with great techniques that make the same basic framework look very difficult. The Ultra Destruction Dragon is a much weaker and messy looking model, it definitely fails as a toy compared to the original two.</span></span></span></span></p>

If you want to buy everything in the Theme for LEGO Dimensions I&rsquo;d strongly recommend picking up Sensei Wu. The dragon models are mostly strong and look great with all the Ninjago mini models in the Theme.</span></span></span></span></p>
