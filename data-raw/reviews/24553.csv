"turtlestack","2016-02-06T21:02:16.71Z","Great flavor set","<p>I bought this set because I wanted to add some color and flair to my growing LEGO Arctic (2014) collection, specially for the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60036-1/Arctic-Base-Camp"">60036:&nbsp;Arctic Base Camp</a>. And though&nbsp;this is a simple set, it feels just right - the tree looks very good with lots of detail and color ornaments, and the addition of a few presents and even a very nice toy train make this a very charming little set.</p>

<p>On its own this would look nice&nbsp;on an office desk or bookcase, but when incorporated&nbsp;with some LEGO sets that have a winter theme&nbsp;(LEGO Arctic, and LEGO Winter Village) then this tree fits right in and adds some extra fun detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is easily the best polybag set I&#39;ve ever purchased. Recommended!</p>
