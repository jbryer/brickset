<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has no distinctive parts that are only available&nbsp;in this set, but it does have some unique parts that are limited to the Ninjago Line for this year.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It comes with Cowler (hence the polybag name) with a re-colored hat from past Ninjago&nbsp;Seasons, but awesome ghostly printing on his torso and pants, with a translucent legs/head&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly simple, and is easy enough where you might not even need the&nbsp;instructions, and its a small enough build where you could build five or more&nbsp;different types of dragons with just this one polybag.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is really nice for display and it has a lot of playability, the wings are on smaller ball-joints so they can swivel 360 degree&#39;s, while the neck and the tail are short and can only go up and down, but if you buy two polybags of this set you could fix this problem, and have one with all ball-joints, and one with clips, or just mix it up.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this polybag is pretty cheap for what it is&nbsp;worth (Depending on where you buy it) and I think buying multiple units of it is a great option, and to change up the designs of the other dragons&nbsp;so you have a nice army of ghost dragons, and you could make the rest of the ghost gang custom dragons, Bansha could have a Mech and a Dragon.</p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some decent parts in this set. The two pale yellow green blades, ninja swords and the one pale yellow green leg are really cool. All the other pale yellow green parts are nice to get&nbsp;as well. The total piece count for the set is 45.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cowler:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Cowler is a decent figure to get in this polybag. He has a purple hat and dark blue mask. He has a single sided head. He has a trans yellow green head and has an angry facial expression. He has printing on the front and back of his torso. He has a dark blue belt on both sides of his torso and well as a mix of pale yellow green, purple and dark blue colors on the front of his torso. He has a ghost symbol on the back of his torso as well. He has pale yellow green hands and dark blue arms. He has a tattered printing on his pants on his legs. It is a half-and-half with the other half being trans yellow green on his legs. He is armed with a silver ninja sword. I would have preferred one of the pale yellow green ninja swords instead, as that is what a lot of the other Ghost Soldiers have as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this is a pretty good polybag. The dragon itself is nice (not as good as the others I own. I own two other dragons from this wave) The dragon head looks okay. The wings are really cool and add the size and look of the dragon. The tail doesn&#39;t look good. It curves up or down and you can&#39;t make it wavy like other dragon tails. Other than the set as a whole is great. Cowler is a nice figure to get and the detail on it is really good. I recommend this set to add to your Lego Ninjago or just to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
