<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Comes in a Polybag with the purchase of the Lego Jurassic World video game at Target. No instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>5 individual parts. Amber piece printing looks great.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Dr. Wu has a double sided printed torso. Has printing on legs to extend lab coat. Double sided face with a happy face on one side and a smirking face on the other side.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, this minifigure came pre-built. However, with the total amount of pieces in the set, it is understandable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great supplement to the Jurassic World sets. For $30, it is a great way to get the minifigure instead of buying the large set.</p>
