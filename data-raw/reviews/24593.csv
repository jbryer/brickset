<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>You got the pieces for this set from a table and put them in a zip lock bag. The instructions were a simple double sided piece of paper.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>62 pieces. Nothing special. One sticker.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very simple and not lengthy. I completed it in 2 or 3 minutes with no trouble.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product looks great. It has a working gate and cool torches and bushes.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I put 2 stars for playability because there is none besides the gate.</p>

<p>I put 5 stars for value for money because this was free.</p>

<p>I put 3 stars for parts because 62 pieces for free is good, even if said pieces aren&#39;t anything special.</p>

<p>I put 2 stars for the building experience because it was very basic, but still fun.</p>

<p>I put 5 stars overall because I absolutely love the finished model.</p>
