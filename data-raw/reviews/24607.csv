<p>Includes two 2x4 bricks, one of which has the USB drive embedded within.&nbsp; The brick with the USB drive also has a small loop and cord meant for a keychain.&nbsp; The cord is very thin but very sturdy.&nbsp; I give the &#39;model&#39; a 5 for parts simply because it&#39;s a USB drive built into a brick!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The drive allots you 8 gigs of storage.&nbsp; The USB 2.0&#39;s male connector is standard-A, and has no metal sheath.&nbsp; It is retractable, hiding perfectly inside the brick.&nbsp; On the underside of the brick there is a switch, which allows you to push the connector out or pull it back in.&nbsp; This is a bit of a two-edged sword though, because the connector often gets pushed back into the brick when you are attempting to plug it into a device, and there is no locking mechanism to keep it in the &#39;out&#39; position.&nbsp; The simple solution to this is to hold the switch forward as you insert the connector into a device.</p>

<p>Despite this design flaw, it really is a beautiful combination of computing technology and LEGO.&nbsp; I currently use the brick to store music.&nbsp; My car&#39;s sound system has a USB port, so I load up the brick with a wide array of tunes and plug it in.&nbsp; I&#39;m not a Mac fan, so this setup is a great alternative to itunes.&nbsp; But I digress.</p>

<p>While 8 gigs of storage space is hardly earth-shattering these days, it&#39;s still a respectable amount considering you&#39;re not going to run substantial applications from an external USB 2.0 drive.&nbsp; The space should be sufficient to hold numerous documents, image files, songs, old-school video game emulators, you name it.&nbsp; In this regard, it&#39;s &#39;playability&#39; is endless.</p>

<p>Being that the drive is encased in a 2x4 brick, the potential for customizability is also endless.&nbsp; I imagine this would also appeal to Raspberry Pi builders, as I have seen a number of LEGO-built cases for such.&nbsp; Having an external LEGO USB drive would make it easy to keep with the motif.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There are certainly less expensive USB drives on the market, but the sheer charm of having one that fits into a LEGO brick is hard to ignore.&nbsp; Although I received mine as a gift, I would absolutely be willing to pay for one.</p>
