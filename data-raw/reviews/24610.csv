The head is all wrong, the pouch sticks out a mile from the torso, the feet are too short... &nbsp;it looks more like a rodent to me.&nbsp;But despite the unrooly (ho-ho) appearance , it&#39;s not without its merits. &nbsp;Althougth&nbsp;the pouch sticks out, this is so it can house a joey.&nbsp;I think that&#39;s the technical term for a baby kangaroo. So you get two &#39;roos for the price of one:mummy-roo and baby-roo.&nbsp;The latter&nbsp;might only consist of three parts (1x2&nbsp;plate, cheese slope and 1x1 round tile), but the tile is in light flesh, a very rare colour indeed. And you get a spare one in the bag too.</p>

<p>Seeing as most owners of this set will have received it for free from a&nbsp;LEGO Shop&#39;s monthly mini-build programme, it&#39;s great value. I am not sure I would have been happy to pay for it on the secondary market though.</p>
