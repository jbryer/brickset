This game is a huge treat for fans of all ages and features some great elements.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>First and foremost the game is beautifully rendered, even on older systems like PS3 the game world looks gorgeous. And on top of that you get to experience the world of Jurassic Park with the charm that is LEGO. It&rsquo;s a huge disappointment that so much was created digitally for this game, but that LEGO has not pursued the older films and only released Jurassic World based sets. Characters like Alan Grant and Ian Malcolm would look great in physical kit form, and a lot of the dinosaurs, such as the Brachiosaur, the Ankylosaur and the Mosasaur are absent as well, they look great in-game and new parts would be worth it to see LEGO create Jurassic Park, The Lost World and Jurassic Park III based sets.</p>

<p>The biggest thing is how they incorporated all of the dialogue from the films as part of the story. I&rsquo;m glad to hear Sir Richard Attenborough uttering his famous lines while you watch the little LEGO people running around Isla Nublar and Isla Sorna. The scope and size of the hub world is very impressive as well, you can explore two full islands broken up between four films, with the locations rarely overlapping.</p>

<p><strong>Game Play</strong></p>

<p>There is considerable meat to this production, you&rsquo;ve got tons of levels to explore including some bonus levels, but the true treat are the two island hub worlds. They are quite expansive and exploring them to unlock secrets, characters and solve puzzles can be very enjoyable.</p>

<p>The custom dino maker feature is leaps and bounds ahead of any other customizing features we&rsquo;ve seen before, expect possibly the custom characters. The cast of Jurassic World also return to provide new dialogue compared to what was in the movie, so you get some truly enjoyable bits of humour.</p>

<p>There are some issues though. The sheer size of the island hub worlds mean that you often find yourself suddenly stuck waiting while the next section loads. And some glitches can be very frustrating making it difficult to complete this game to 100%. Patch data has been created that hopefully corrects a lot of the big problems, but typical issues from these LEGO games continue to persist. Chief among them is the co-op split screen issues, I generally don&rsquo;t have anyone to play with, but I&rsquo;ve heard that co-op in these games has become quite frustrating and can cause a lot of problems. And there&rsquo;s still that odd issue that sometimes too many red bricks activated will cause the game to seize up and force a complete system reset to break the cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This game is worth picking up. Get it for whatever system you enjoy, but you have to experience it to truly enjoy it. And as a fan of Jurassic Park this game delivers on so many levels, from the ability to control a T-Rex and run down Minifigures and smaller dinosaurs, to the typical humour and charm of the LEGO Video Games, this one does not fail to deliver. Strongly recommended.</p>
