<p>The art here is pretty nice, with the dishonestly shiny Cyberman on the front in a facility filled with inactive Cybermen.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are slightly less interesting, but I think the dark tan wedge plates and the Dalek&nbsp;dome are nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Cyberman is the minifigure you get here, and he&#39;s great. Based on the modern post-revival design, the figure captures the trademark look of the Cybermen, with their handlebar heads and the tear-like eye design. The plated armor of the body is generic enough to be used in multiple places, most notably, Iron Man figures, due to the arc-reactor-like core. The minifigure is entirely pearl silver, which is fine, and the head, of course, is a new mold.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was pretty simple, with some basic SNOT techniques used for the Dalek&#39;s plating.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Dalek&nbsp;serves its purpose, looking like the Doctor&#39;s most famous and numerous enemies. The exposed studs of a LEGO plate capture the knobs on a Dalek&#39;s sides rather nicely, and the sloping front has been achieved well. However, the black rim on the base is less than satisfatory, with the Ideas model capturing it slightly better. A nice unintentional feature of the Dalek is that its head can be removed pretty easily, and a minifigure torso can be placed where it was, a la Davros. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>The Cyberman is one of those characters you need to &nbsp;buy for completion, but only for minor reasons, like a puzzle or two only possible with that one character. His abilities include explosive shots that destroy silver LEGO, using control panels and hacking blue terminals, and diving underwater. There&#39;s at least one underwater terminal guarded by silver, so good luck solving that! The main draw for me, though, was the drone ability which he shares with Doc Brown. In the Cyberman&#39;s case, he&#39;ll summon a Cybermat from the ground, which can move independently in a large range and can collect items. Leaving the range or switching out of drone mode will cause it to fall apart. The main purpose, though, is to navigate blue tube mazes, which will usually lead to a switch that opens a chest containing a Gold Brick. The Cyberman and Doc are currently the only characters with drones, and I think this one is much more useful.</p>

<p>The Dalek, however, is a bit disappointing if you wanted a character, for, like the Sentry Turret, it has been stripped of its personality and is only treated as a nonsentient vehicle. While you could argue that it was hijacked and the pilot inside removed, it still feels a bit odd to be hitching a ride on a silent Dalek. Its blasts are also explosive, and it can be upgraded to some atrocious-looking models which will grant further abilities like gold destruction.</p>

<p>While I&#39;ve already discussed it in my Doctor Who Level Pack review, owning the Cyberman will allow you to access the Doctor Who world.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is a great Fun Pack to have. The minifigure is fantastic, and the gameplay is greatly enhanced by using him. I&#39;d recommend it!</p>

"ThoughtLash","2016-03-06T21:26:20.603Z","""This is not war - this is pest control!"" -Dalek Sec","<p>I picked this up on sale today, due to being a very big <em>Doctor Who</em> fan. I don&#39;t even have Dimensions, I just wanted a Dalek model and a Cyberman!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set came in a cardboard package, an oddly-shaped affair that can be opened along the side. It features a closeup of a Cyberman, with an army of the Mondasian cyborgs in the background.</p>

<p>The instructions&nbsp;are quite lame, really. They show only how to build the Cyberman and how to use him in the game, the Dalek must either be found online or in the game. The remaining half of the thin booklet is a checklist for the other Dimensions sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts here are rather common, consisting of plates and bricks with studs on the sides. Seven of the parts are in sand yellow, while the remaining few are black, tan, trans-blue,&nbsp;or silver, for the Cyberman. A printed sand yellow dish is included for use as the Dalek&#39;s dome. It is printed with the mount for the eyestalk and the two small lights on the top, which flash when the Dalek speaks.</p>

<p>The Cyberman uses an entirely new head sculpt, representing a Mondas Cyberman from the latter part of the new series. These are found from <em>Nigthmare in Silver </em>to <i>Dark Water/Death in Heaven </i>to <em>Hell Bent</em>. While I prefer both the Cybus and 80&#39;s Cybermen, this looks excellent. His body is also printed with an armored pattern, showing the armor&nbsp;plates and glowing light in the chest.</p>

<p>Two trans-light blue stands are also included, for use in the game. As I don&#39;t have the game, I don&#39;t know how well they work. The Dalek&#39;s is unprinted and features four studs, while the Cyberman&#39;s has a design resembling a Cyberman&#39;s chest and has only two studs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Cyberman looks amazing! The printing is wonderful, looking the best that a LEGO version can. I love the detail that LEGO put into him, it&#39;s definatley superior to the Character Building version, which I also have.</p>

<p>While the Dalek is not counted as a minifigure, I will list it as one. It looks great, despite being rather oversized (Daleks should be eye-level or less, depending on the version). The sand yellow matches with the Time War Dalek casings quite well, although the tan sticks out a little. Studs are used as the trademark &quot;Dalek Bumps&quot; or &quot;hemispheres,&quot; and a black joystick and torch are used as the plunger and gunstick, respectively.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Assembly didn&#39;t take long at all, and the Dalek is actually quite simple, using a good bit of SNOT on the inside. The Cyberman was the same as building any other minifigure, legs-torso-head-base.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>See minifigures.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would definately recommend this set, although I would advise getting it on sale (personally, $15 seems a little steep for what is included). Highly recommended for <em>Doctor Who </em>fans!</p>

I find myself avoiding them so instead of discussing them independently I&rsquo;ve combined the build discussion for this set.

"Minifig290","2018-03-02T13:53:50.42Z","Good Set Horrid Price","<p>This Review is based on the set ONLY and not based on anything in the game. This set was released in 2016 as part of Wave four in year one for the terrible price of &pound;14.99.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The Cyberman is exclusive and uses a new and brilliant mold for his head that hasn&#39;t yet been re-printed. Its torso and leg print is very good and looks very similar to the detail seen on&nbsp;the BBC series villains. Its toy tag has a blue spot surrounded with the same type if print used on his torso.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Exterminate&quot;&nbsp; this build and you&#39;ll regret it, as it is fantastic and uses a printed dish on its head. Its torso is angled and the exposed studs look like the spots on the &quot;real&quot; robots. The Darlek&nbsp;sits on a toy tag that has a 2x2 round plate with a stud to keep the build on the tag.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>For a set that only has 40 parts there are a few excellent pieces like all the parts for the Cyberman&nbsp;and the Darleks dish of which all are exclusive&nbsp;and the Cyberman&#39;s toy tag&nbsp;is unique to this set.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Everything about this set is great apart from one thing and that is its hidiouse price, you only get 40 parts and your paying &pound;15 meaning the price per part is stupidly high at 37.5p one of the highest ppp ever. Everything else about this set is great thought and it would make a great battle pack if it was only cheaper. So unless this set is cheap don&#39;t buy it unless you are a Doctor Who fan or Dimensions player.</p>
