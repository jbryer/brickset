<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">When I look at this little Lego build,3850001: Crocodile. I can&#39;t help but smile at it. The set looks funny because of its proportions to its funny little eyes. Interesting story about this set; it was exclusively at Lego stores, which means it is a bit rarer. You had to buy a small packet with instructions, and if you did, you would go to the Pick a Brick Wall and get the pieces for it. When I originally got it back in 2015, I was at a lego store with my grandma. I saw it, and then I looked at the price tag, which was a little bit too much. I was going to get a cup of Pick a Brick anyway, so I asked my grandma to take pictures of the packaging. When I got home that same day, I looked at the pictures, poured out my Pick a Brick, and rebuilt it. Many years later, I discovered a picture of the set and remembered that I had it, so I pulled out my Lego bin and built it from the same pictures my grandma took all those years ago. The set itself doesn&#39;t have much playability.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">&nbsp;The tail of this lego creature is connected with a one-by-four hinge plate. Its jaw can move up and down. It doesn&#39;t have lots of different functions.&nbsp; The set also comes with a small side build,&nbsp; which I assume is bubbling water. The set itself has a couple of other good green pieces, which are always convenient to have around for your individual build.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The only problem I have with this set is the piece count. It&#39;s relatively low, 30 pieces. That&#39;s not too many. I don&#39;t know how much the retail price for this wise I would assume about 5 to 10. The piece count is bad in my eyes because a general rule of thumb for me is the price-to-piece ratio should usually be about 10 cents per piece. So, for example, if your set is $20, it should at least have 200 or more pieces. The problem with having such a small piece count means it takes pretty much only a minute to build.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">If you want to buy this set, good luck! I have never seen one listed on Brick Link or eBay. However, the parts are common enough that you could probably just build it if you wanted.</span></span></p>
