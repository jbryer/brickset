"Bl0ck_Head","2016-01-09T06:36:02.04Z","The Green Mech!","<p>Hey, this time i&#39;m reviewing a set that is actually just a bundle of two books, its $24.99 in the USA and $26.99 Canada, I bought this for&nbsp;retail price at the time this review was made.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It is actually not a box, it is two books hidden in a slide over cover, one &quot;book&quot; comes with the parts, and a part list, the actual book comes with the instructions and 50 building ideas you can look at, sort of like any other LEGO book, accept instead of coming with a minifigure it comes with some bricks to build an actual item, I would like to say the book and Mech ideas are not from LEGO, after the instructions it states that the builder of all the creations is Barney Main, but he worked with the Lego Ninjago&nbsp;team in Denmark to actually make the book and the rest is history (or in this case, in the book)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It comes with 74 pieces, out of those pieces I would say that probably only 5 of those are exclusive to this particular set, since there is not a online parts list I will not go any further with the parts, and focus more on the other sections of this review. (and I don&#39;t know how to add images)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It comes with one minifigure to build, it is a somewhat custom minifigure of Lloyd, it has an exclusive Green Mask that I have never seen, but it has the Torso from set&nbsp;70728, and the Legs from set 9450, one would say this is a very cheap way to get those exclusive&nbsp;torso &amp; leg pieces, instead of buying those $100.00+ sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly easy, nothing that interesting to mention, it has a decent amount of ball joints big and small, and it has a&nbsp;more interesting background for the instructions&nbsp;then the somewhat normal grey&nbsp;instructions we have seen.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like the completed model for both play and display, I like the way the creator used seat pieces to act as armor for the minifigure to stay in place of the mech, they are on hinges and can move up and down, the arms are slightly awkward due to fingers being non existent&nbsp;and the shoulder ball joint connecting to the elbow can&#39;t really move forward due to a certain part, it does not have any waist movement, and no knee movement, but it can move its ankles to position it in certain ways, it is decently top heavy for some reason so it has a minimum of positions it can go into before toppling over,&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think the actual book is fascinating and pretty good for any amateur builders that might need help getting inspiration or ideas, the minifigure is a must have for any ninjago/llyod fans &amp; collectors, the mech&nbsp;is a great collector&#39;s item but it is not worth $24.99 in my opinion, maybe $15-20 dollars.</p>

<p>Hope my review helps you decide on whether you should get this set, I say get it on sale!</p>
