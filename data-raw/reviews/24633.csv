<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Bricks are in a clear packet inside a big box (as shown in this set image). Parts list is printed outside the box. Instruction is inside the book.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good selection of parts. Included is part 2341 in white that I only have seen in this set. The car&#39;s wind shield (clear 62360&nbsp;Cockpit W. Bow 3X6X1) is consistent with other friends car. Some 2015 parts like the lavender curved slopes 6037655 and&nbsp;6097647. The rest of the parts are quite common.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Includes one minidoll&nbsp;named Liza, she&#39;s in 2014&#39;s Sunshine Ranch (41039) and 2015&#39;s Friends Advent Calendar (41102). She has a long thick blonde wavy hair tied half-way&nbsp;at the back; same hair as other Friends&#39; friends Marie and Isabella.&nbsp;She wears&nbsp;a striped light green and white sleeveless blouse and pink&nbsp;shorts.&nbsp;Her outfit is quite common as the torso (6049743)&nbsp;has appeared in several other sets as well as her shorts&nbsp;(6055578).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is&nbsp;simple, illustrated in 19 steps.&nbsp;My kid can follow easily as the front and back are almost similar. She asked for the steering wheel, though. :p Who knows this car maybe the car of the future fully automated. \/(^-^)\/</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a tiny car good for 2 minidolls. It has a nice purple tone.</p>

<h3>The Book</h3>

<p>The book has a hard cover with slipcase. It&nbsp;has lots of great ideas to make up your own story/adventure. It introduces the Friends characters to get you familiar.&nbsp;Similar to Ideas book it shows you details of&nbsp;useful pieces/bricks and how to build them.&nbsp;This book is good reference for both old and&nbsp;new fans of Lego Friends.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The build is simple with use of common pieces so that your kid (and you ^,^) will have idea on how to make great builds out of various parts.&nbsp;</p>
