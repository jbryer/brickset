<p>The head looks new to me (but I could be wrong),&nbsp;and a well printed part. &nbsp;The other part worth mentioning is his &quot;tail&quot;, (it might be hard to notice in the picture). &nbsp;I&nbsp;think it is the same one as &quot;Rocket the Raccoon&quot; from &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;.</p>

<p>He&nbsp;does&nbsp;look&nbsp;menacing&nbsp;with&nbsp;his&nbsp;snarling&nbsp;teeth. &nbsp;&nbsp;His&nbsp;torso&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;ripped&nbsp;up&nbsp;flannel&nbsp;shirt with the name of &quot;Kel&quot; on it. &nbsp;The legs are dual colored and well printed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are looking to find this guy with the feel method, I would look for the big bone. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>The packaging is very nice.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This guy&#39;s parts are decent. He has a new werewolf head, which is very similar to the Monster Fighters version. It&#39;s one special piece, even though it seemed that it might be a mask. He reuses Rocket Raccoon&#39;s tail, and his bone piece is okay.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy as can be.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>First off, this guy is hilarious. His outfit reveals that he used to be Kel the Lumberjack from Series 5. I think it&#39;s great that they turned an older character into a monster. LEGO&#39;s bio suggests that he&#39;s a permanent wolfman, though, and not a shapechanging werewolf, but he&#39;s a werewolf in my mind. His shirt and jeans are now tattered and torn, with the trousers being torn above the knee. Dual-molded legs are used for this. His claws are visible on the toes. His bone accessory is a bit lazy to me, and makes little sense, but it&#39;s fine.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this guy is great. I love that LEGO made an older character into a monster, and I think they did it well.</p>

There are many who praised these figures when they first came out and for good reason.</p>

<p>The Wolf Guy represents a brand new interpretation of the Werewolf which was first used/created in Series 2 with a much more traditional appearance. Returning the more animal-like look of the character Wolf Guy reuses the Monster Fighters head piece, or a very similar sculpt design to the muzzled dog-like appearance of the werewolf. He has some very impressive printing on this head piece as well for the eyes and the teeth.</p>

<p>His torso is double-sided with rips and tears everywhere showing the transformation has damaged his wardrobe. His legs have been dual molded featuring a dark grey for the lower feet which feature claws printed on the toes. More rips are present on the jeans revealing fur underneath. This character has a name on his breast pocket too, Kel, it could be a brand name for the shirt, however I don&#39;t think so.</p>

<p>Wolf Guy is very impressive, and it&#39;s clear that LEGO designed him with a bit of tongue in cheek humour typical of LEGO. Wolf Guy is Series 5 Lumberjack after being out in the woods one spooky night he must have come across a werewolf and suffered the curse. Now after every full moon he&#39;s forced to run wild through the woods, a large bone in place of the axe at his side.</p>

<p>A great looking minifigure and a very nice addition to any spooky, scary, holiday display. Strongly recommend tracking him down if you haven&#39;t done so already.</p>
