<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for Series 14 is very nice. My other reviews describe it better, so I won&#39;t waste time trying to find something new to say here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Zombie Pirate&#39;s parts are decent. His beard appears in a new color, and his hook hand could be useful.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He&#39;s okay, but not as good as I would like him to be. My biggest issue is that he looks a bit like the Series 8 Pirate Captain, but somewhere along the line they abandoned the idea and tried to make him more unique. As a result, it&#39;s another confused design. I would have preferred it if they went all the way to make him look like a zombified&nbsp;Pirate Captain, but they didn&#39;t. His hat is nice, as the skull has xed-out&nbsp;eyes, which is&nbsp;humorous attempt to&nbsp;make&nbsp;a skull even more spooky. The Zombie Skateboarder also does this with his sweatshirt. The Zombie Pirate&#39;s coat is nicely tattered, and the printing carries down to his leg, which is the first time a peg-leg assembly has had printing on the normal one. Again, there are references to the S8 Captain in the collar and the jacket color, but the strap doesn&#39;t match. His face has a nice growling expression and some whiskers. He has a leather eye patch on a different eye than the S8 Captain&#39;s, and a gold tooth. His hook is a dark metallic grey.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I want to like him more, but I&#39;m disappointed in the design. I don&#39;t know why they decided to make him a separate character from the previous pirate, because a few of the design touches make it seem that he was originally supposed to be the same guy. He&#39;s okay, but he could be much better.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-10-03T20:38:10.54Z","Arr, I come for your braaiiiins.","<p><strong>Set #71010 Zombie Pirate:</strong> LEGO has a habit of making some truly inspired looking monsters, and while this might seem to be just another pirate to be forgotten, I like to think it&#39;s a clever way to re-use the traditional pirate parts in a new and exciting fashion.</p>

<p>This minifigure has the distinction of being the first to feature double-molding on the standard LEGO Pirate peg leg piece. Here he&#39;s wearing a black boot with his red coat dangling down over the leg. He features a single-sided torso with impressive print detailing on the pirate&#39;s jacket, showing undead flesh underneath the coat and undershirt.</p>

<p>His single-sided facial print is impressive as well with a frightening red eye leering out on one side. He also uses the new beard piece to great effect and has some rusty looking gold teeth in his mouth. The standard Pirate hat piece has new printing with a Jolly Roger symbol who&#39;s eyes are Xed out to indicate death. And the large Orc Scimitar blade from LotR is an excellent accessory compared to the more traditional sword found with pirates.</p>

<p>Overall he&#39;s a great minifigure, one of the weaker offerings due to the fact that he is a Zombie Pirate Captain, if they&#39;d made him more generic he&#39;d make for a much better army builder for tons of Zombie pirates. He&#39;s still a pretty solid figure though and definitely recommended.</p>
