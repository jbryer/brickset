"8BrickMario","2015-09-03T21:29:08.223Z","You'd be mad to pass him up!","<p>I really really hated this guy at first, but I soon warmed up to him and he even became a priority purchase. Should I have waited?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The S14 bags are nice, and the checklist sheet is, too. I apologize for running out of commentary, but I&#39;ve already reviewed three!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some very interesting parts are used here, with the most notable being his big-brained head. It is cleverly simulated with a &quot;hat&quot; piece that encompasses the goggles, fringe of hair, and extended head. The goggles and hair serve to completely hide the transition between the two parts. His torso and legs are semi-useful, but the pink splatters seem a bit limiting. Both his arms and his legs are dual-molded in two plastics. His flask&#39;s liquid is solid pink, and is also limited due to the printing, but I appreciate that we finally get one that indicates the potion&#39;s effect.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing out of the ordinary, just a simple minifig assembly.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What a unique design. He&#39;s very cartoony and fun, in a very good way. Underneath his false head there are some normal eyes above his crazy&nbsp;smile and messy&nbsp;mustache. Without the head extension, he&nbsp;looks very much like Albert Einstein. His lab coat looks great, with the simulated rubber gloves and boots,&nbsp;and his head is well-designed, with his eyes spinning around in his oversized goggles. Some forehead muscles are printed above his eyebrows. His flask has a fly printed on it, which he has used on a housefly to create the Fly Monster. In fact, despite his wacky appearance, he&#39;s LEGO&#39;s most prolific mad scientist, with three monsters to his name! (The Plant Monster, Monster Rocker, and Fly Monster are all his.)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s a unique mad scientist among the group, and I think that makes him quite desirable. His design is silly and strange, but in the right setting, he&#39;d be fine. I recommend finding him!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-10-03T20:50:19.31Z","Not very Monstery.","<p><strong>Set #71010 Monster Scientist: </strong>I found myself somewhat disappointed with this minifigure from the range, he&#39;s rather plain compared to all of the more unique creatures and characters that were made for Series 14. That being said he isn&#39;t a terrible figure.</p>

<p>Dual molding is used on both the torso and the legs for this guy, dressed in a large white smock that has been sealed with clasps down his right side. He also has some of the pink concoction spilled on his front. His face is a single-sided print with an ordinary looking expression and regular eyes. Attach the fun looking head piece over it and he get&#39;s big goofy looking goggles, wild and crazy hair and a bald head that would put Marge Simpson to shame.</p>

<p>The accessory is a beaker full of some kind of genetic soup that features the image of a fly printed on it, perhaps a hint that this &#39;Monster&#39; Scientist is in fact destined to become a genuine monster. Overall I&#39;d have to say he has some interesting parts, especially with the dual molding, however I&#39;d say if you aren&#39;t a fan of his overall appearance you can easily skip him. Mildly recommended for completionists.</p>

<p>The monster scientist is a nice figure but I wish that I got the whacky witch from the monster CMFs instead .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has an enlarged head attachment meant to represent a maxed out cranium the piece also features some wrinkle printing , dual moulded goggles , hair and eyebrows , the head is a very wrinkled happy face with a large moustache , the torso is euphemistically printed and has dual moulded arms and the legs are very much the same story also with dual moulded legs .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His only accessory is a dual moulded printed conical flask with a fly inside . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a nice figure don&#39;t get me wrong , but this series was so versatile in its selection that I wish I got the whacky witch , werewolf , banshee , zombie business man , Venus fly trap dude or the gargoyle , but it is not bad I wish I got some different ones .&nbsp;</p>
