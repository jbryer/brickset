<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The packaging is good, with a spooky thunderstorm background over the black color. The &quot;shelves&quot; have returned to the checklist graphics, and amusingly, the Banshee is shown floating above her row. The instructions for the cloth accessories are most welcome.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>All of the Wacky Witch&#39;s parts are,&nbsp;predictably, witchy! The highlight is her new hat/hair piece, as she&#39;s the first witch since Willa to have hair represented. The hat is floppier and more crooked, with some tears in the brim and a crease along the side, while the hair is straight and straw-like...almost like a&nbsp;<em>Scarecrow&#39;s</em>... She has a broomstick, and appears to reuse Ewok&nbsp;Village Leia&#39;s skirt in a new color. Her black cat is fantastic, and I love its gloomier expression. Her legs are molded in two colors, with the white section being printed over.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quite simple, especially since instructions for putting on her skirt have been provided for the first time!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is just a perfect Halloween witch. Everything about her, from her bright colors, patched-up clothes, and stripy socks captures it so well. The stripy socks and the patch on her left arm are my favorite details, but the whole design is great. My only problem with her is that her hair&#39;s a little loose, but I think the head&#39;s clutch is the problem, as other hairpieces became loose when tried on her.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>She&#39;s a great character, and a perfect witch for Halloween or fairy tales. I highly recommend picking her up.</p>

<p>Series 14 is a collection&nbsp;of dark magic references<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b>such as muggle&nbsp;Inferi and ghosts. However, the &quot;Wacky Witch is one of the worst things they could have done.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Very bright, first thing that caught&nbsp;my eye.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>New cat piece! And that ladys and gentelmen, is the best thing about this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Possibly&nbsp;the most racist, stereotypical figure&nbsp;I have ever seen. This figure is the most offensive&nbsp;thing to the wizerding&nbsp;community since Umbridge. First of all, most of us do not share a unique skin color (We aren&#39;t green), nor are we usually&nbsp;dressed in dresses and stockings. In fact, most of us prefer&nbsp;robes. This is most likely&nbsp;baced&nbsp;very losely&nbsp;on 16th century witches.&nbsp;The hat is cool though.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Short.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Too purple</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Horrible&nbsp;and racist. Also, needs a wand.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-10-03T20:56:49.66Z","Hanzel and Gretle Beware!","<p><strong>Set #71010 Wacky Witch:</strong> This particular minifigure really looks like she might have just stepped out of a fairy tale story about a dangerous witch. She&#39;s got a familiar, a broom to fly on and a very impressive new head piece.</p>

<p>A series dedicated to monsters wouldn&#39;t be complete without a Witch of some sort. Dressed in purple with a double-sided torso and some nice detailing for patches repaired in her outfit, this wickedly green looking witch is truly evil, but is she truly wacky? Her expression doesn&#39;t seem to agree with that as it&#39;s a pretty plain one. She has long white with black striped socks on her legs and black boots represented by the dual-molded prints.</p>

<p>Her accessory has been seen many times before, but her cat is a nice black coloured animal piece and it looks like it&#39;s sad. She or He has some printing on the face that indicates they&#39;re unhappy for some reason. Perhaps this feline familiar was cursed with this form for defying the witch?</p>

<p>Overall a very fun looking figure, and a nice addition to the series. I love the new hat piece with attached hair, which has since been reused for a new Scarecrow in the DC Theme. Recommended.</p>
