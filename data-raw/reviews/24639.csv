<p>The most obvious new part is the &quot;Plant Hat&quot;. &nbsp;And it looks (to me) that it is a two colored part, pink on the inside and lime green on the outside. &nbsp;(I am not sure about &quot;tongue&quot; for this part if it is printed&nbsp;or a third type of plastic for the part.) &nbsp;</p>

<p>The legs and torso are well printed with vines &amp; leaves all over. &nbsp;The last two parts to mention are the &quot;vines / whips&quot; in line green. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The one down side for this figure is the &quot;head&quot;,&nbsp;it needs to be a two sided print. &nbsp;The scared face can be confusing for what&nbsp;it should be&nbsp;(story wise). &nbsp;</p>

<p>I do see people getting&nbsp;multiple of this guy (for various reasons). &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are using the feel method to fine this guy I would look for the &quot;vines / whips&quot; to find him. &nbsp;But I am guessing the &quot;Plant Hat&quot; could be easy enough to identify (if you know what it is). &nbsp;</p>

"8BrickMario","2015-09-26T22:03:26.413Z","Going Green?","<p>I was attracted to the look of this figure once I saw it. It&#39;s a bizzare and fun design, but is it worth it?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I do enjoy the S14 packaging, but I&#39;ve run out of things to say about it!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are fairly useful. With some work, the plant mask could be integrated into a build or be used as a costume for Poison Ivy henchman over in the DC theme. The vines have appeared in a few sets before, but this is a nice way to get them. The head will be useful for any scared minifigure!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple, as per usual.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like it! This minifigure has a design ambiguity that I<em> like</em>, since it looks good when viewed as a costume or a real monster. The colors are very bright and attractive, with the body&#39;s base color actually being bright green. The head is molded well, with the back having a leaf texture with veins molded in. The inside of the mouth is pink, with the &quot;tongue&quot; being a lighter shade. The printing on the body simulates the vine stalk of the monster well enough. The central vine actually curls around its&nbsp;ight leg and onto the right toes! He has back printing continuing the pattern. His arms are green and hold vines to represent more of the plant&#39;s tendrils. According to LEGO, the screaming man inside is being eaten (he&#39;ll be spit out again in a few hours), but he could just as easily be a terrified partygoer&nbsp;or trick-or-treater.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is a good design. It&#39;s not as confused as the Tiger Woman or Zombie Pirate, since it&#39;s convincing in both contexts. It&#39;s visually interesting, and well detailed, so I&#39;d recommend getting it!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-02T21:46:58.73Z","Devouring his Victim","<p><strong>Set #71010 Plant Monster:</strong> This particular Series 14 character is not a man in a costume, but in fact is meant to represent a creature similar to Audrey 2 from Little Shop of Horrors. In fact the expression on the head used for the face here is one of sheer terror because the poor soul is being eaten alive by the plant beast.</p>

<p>This figure looks great, his torso is covered in vines including the print on his leg, and he&#39;s holding two vine accessories to represent more vines of the plant. The headpiece is a great looking one reminiscent of the Venus fly trap. The shape and size of the bulb is quite nicely detailed in the sculpt and there&#39;s a leafy pattern on the top.</p>

<p>Overall when it comes down to it this particular character is a really fun looking minifigure. I&#39;d recommend tracking one down if you missed out on him in the past.</p>

"ThoughtLash","2015-11-02T22:40:49.713Z","Feed Me!","<p>I really think that this is inspired by Audrey II from the&nbsp;<em>Little Shop of Horrors </em>movies/musicals.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The basic minifigures bag, and checklist.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The head is the most notable piece, and is clearly inspired by Audrey II.&nbsp; The vines are common enough, and the body pieces are green with lime vine details.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Plant Monster is either a minfigure cosplaying as Audrey II, or is actually being eaten by a giant plant.&nbsp; The vine detail is great, and the expression is wonderful for someone being eaten. :P</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building a minifig.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When completed, the Plant Monster looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend this guy!</p>
