<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard S14 packaging, with nice graphics. Same goes for the checklist.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>First off, the head. The head is a matte black finish with slightly flexible antennae, and the compound eyes are molded in translucent red. It looks fantastic, but the head oddly does not cover the entire minifigure neck. The body is rather limited by the print, but the claw hand (formerly Davy Jones&#39;)&nbsp;will be very very useful. He reuses the Series 8&nbsp;Fairy&#39;s wings in Translucent Black.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing complex here, only 4 parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Wow. I&#39;m a bit unsettled that I find this guy absolutely adorable. His huge compound eyes give him a bizarre cuteness. His claw hand is a reference to the original film of <i>The Fly</i>, and it gives him a nice asymmetrical look. While it doesn&#39;t have a stud connection, the claw can hold anything with a 3mm bar on it, which is very nice. The print is simple but effective, with the carapace being printed in silver and some green hairs surrounding it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This guy is a great figure. For an insect minifigure, he has a surprising amount&nbsp;of charm and will be useful in space and mad-science&nbsp;laboratory MOCs. I highly recommend him.</p>

<p>The print on the torso may be single sided and bleed very slightly into the upper waist of the legs, it is a great print with some impressive and simple design cues of an actual fly. With hair and some segmented looking torso section. The head piece is pretty neat too and made slightly softer to prevent the antenna from breaking.</p>

<p>Fly Monster is a great looking Minifigure and one I strongly recommend from the set. The single claw hand can grasp and hold standard accessories, and the wing piece he&#39;s using is a great looking one. Strongly Recommended.</p>
