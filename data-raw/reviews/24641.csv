"8BrickMario","2015-09-05T23:51:03.42Z","Ghoulish fun!","<p>One of two ghosts in the series, the Specter may seem a bit bland...and he is. But he&#39;s got a lot of character to spare. Is he worth it?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is very attractive, but the black color is a bit repetitive after Series 8. The checklist illustrates the figures very well.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>In terms of parts, this guy is very useful. His hood is the most notable to me, as it&#39;s in Dark Grey for the first time in eleven years. His cloak fits the same as the Hun Warrior&#39;s, with a horizontal slit for the neck and the front section going over the front of the torso. However, the cloak is a different cut, which is tattered and torn, much like the Dementors&#39; in the 2010 Harry Potter sets. His torso is completely blank, and completely Dark Grey. His chain is a metallic dark grey (or gunmetal grey) and his ghostly lower half&nbsp;is the same as the Ninjago figures&#39; and the Banshee&#39;s, with dark grey molded into the clear plastic.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A fairly simple build here, but the chain was difficult to attach, due to fresh CMF hands&#39; tendency to resist a stud connection.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This guy is very interesting. He&#39;s a classic chain-rattling, house-haunting spook, but his expression seems to say that it&#39;s all in fun. His face is actually glow-in-the-dark, for the first time in the CMF line. His cloak gives him quite a presence, and his ghostly bottom adds to the spectral look.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s not my favorite minifigure in the series, but I think he&#39;s still a good one to have. What haunted house is complete without a ghost or two? I would recommend him.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As the usual packaging goes with the mini figs, please be careful when opening as to avoid accidentally cutting / losing any parts. Check list was useful.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Ah the parts, as usual no extra , but this figure did come with torso , head and covering , chains , base, cape , and ghostly like legs. The legs are pretty neat in my opinion , as they definitely capture the ghost like quality of the mini fig. I would have been disappointed if they used the regular legs. The cape is a soft felty feel which is nice, and went on quite well without having it bunch up in areas or needing adjusting to get it to hang <em>just</em> right.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The mini figure looks fun without it being &quot;cheap scary&quot;. I love his little face which glows in the dark.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build went smoothly until it got to putting the chains on the hands. I ended up with two spectres and one of them went together with no problem while the other I needed help getting the chains on the hands. A little patience and it goes well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Completed model looks great and goes with any haunted house MOCs you may have or any seasonal sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this one. I feel like they did well in creating this one. When I first opened it up I thought of A Christmas Carol with the chains!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-02T21:57:55.33Z","Fearful Spectre of Death","<p><strong>Set #71010 Spectre: </strong>This particular minifigure isn&#39;t as iconic as some other monsters, it&#39;s basically a cloaked and hooded ghost with rattling chains and a glow-in-the-dark head. So not really meant to represent anything particular, but still a very nice looking set.</p>

<p>Using a plain gray torso with no printing and the lower tail piece introduced with LEGO Ninjago the Spectre is very minimalistic. His only printing is found on his face with the goofy looking expression, he&#39;s certainly not meant to be a terrifying figure. The cloak is very impressive, the soft goods item I believe was used for LEGO Dementors back during the Harry Potter theme.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say this is a very nice looking character. I do however feel that it may be one of the weaker ones from this particular series if only because it isn&#39;t as recognizable as a famous figure from Monsterdom. I still recommend it though.</p>

"Fauch","2015-12-19T18:25:03.21Z","some good parts, average fig.","<p>This guy comes with a decent selection of pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ghost legs are the same as ninjago ones, in trans clear and dark blueish grey and appear only in this set. I think the colors give a more ghostly look than the ninjago ones, but the transition between ghost legs and torso doesn&#39;t look very natural to me, fortunately that is quite well hidden by the cloak</p>

<p>The torso is unprinted and completely dark blueish grey, included the hands. it is exclusive as well. No printing feels very cheap to me, there should have been some, like the ghost body, or maybe torn clothes. fortunately the dark grey color could still makes this an useful piece.</p>

<p>The head is decent, the printing is not impressive but nod bad either and look different from anything I&#39;ve seen. of course it glows in the dark.</p>

<p>The hood is in dark blueish grey as well, it&#39;s a rare piece in that color.</p>

<p>The chain was a nice surprise as I didn&#39;t know it existed in metallic silver which looks much better than dark grey. quite an uncommon piece as well.</p>

<p>The cloak is the best piece and is unique, it is soft, flexible, thicker than the usual cape, though feels a bit too fluffy for a ghost cloak maybe. It is dark blueish grey as well.</p>

<p>The completed figure looks quite monochrome to me with a lot of dark blueish grey, though the cloak is what saves it from being a poor figure and does a pretty good job at it. The chain is a very nice touch as well. The unprinted torso is a shame for a figure worth 4&euro;.</p>

"Witolman","2015-11-20T15:56:01.583Z","HEAD GLOWS IN THE DARK!!!","<p>It&#39;s just a minifig so it will be short review. (sorry for my English)</p>

<p>I really like this minifig. The expression on the face makes it look kinda cute. It&#39;s cloth is the softer type which I think is the better one, because it&#39;s more durable. It doesn&#39;t have any printing except the face, but it&#39;s not a problem because the cape covers everything. It&#39;s legs are the ghost type of legs and they capture the look of a ghost very good. They&#39;re mostly clear, except one gray line of plastic. It also has a chain to make <em>creepy</em> sounds at night.</p>

<p>AND THE HEAD <strong>GLOWS IN THE DARK</strong> which is awesome!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s the most popular minifig in series 14 for a reason. It&#39;s a classic good looking ghost. Only bad thing is the price, which is a little too high.</p>
