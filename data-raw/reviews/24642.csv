<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is very nice.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The hair is the standout part here. I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s taken this long to get a proper pair of pigtails from LEGO, but it was worth the wait! The hair is well molded, with some hair bands around each pigtail. There&#39;s a small pin hole in the top for hair accessories, which makes me think this&#39;ll be in the Friends line next year. I can&#39;t wait to see it on Harley Quinn! Her other parts are nice, but not very useful.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>She&#39;s a pretty nice minifigure! I like the idea of a zombie cheerleader joining the ranks, and I love her dark green &quot;team&quot; color. She has a Z on her shirt (three guesses what that stands for), and the entire uniform is tattered and torn. Her face shows an uncertain grin, as if her team might be in trouble. One of her teeth is missing, and she&#39;s got undead red eyes. Her hair is the same dark tan color as the Zombie Bride&#39;s (no family relation, just dead hair), and her hairbands are printed in dark green. Her pom-poms match.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>She&#39;s a pretty weird idea, but a great execution. I think it&#39;s cool to have younger monsters, as it brings diversity to the group. She&#39;ll probably be paired with the Zombie Skateboarder when he comes out. I would recommend her.</p>

<p>Grabbed a few of this series of CMF after reading Brickset&#39;s review of them. Good stuff.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The cheerleader has the first LEGO pompoms I&#39;ve ever had and they&#39;re really nice pieces; super well molded and made of a nice rubbery material.</p>

<p>Probably the best part included in this set is the hair. The hair ties are molded in a separate color and look fantastic. Another plus is that the hair is not blocked by the torso like some of the larger hair pieces are, so it can rotated to look in any direction you choose.</p>

<p>My only gripe is a general one: there is no printing on the back of the fig&#39;s legs. I don&#39;t think any figs have been released with printing on the back of their legs, which is unfortunate, because it really ruins the look from certain angles to see the skirt/leg printing cut off at the back.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very detailed figure. The tears and cuts in the cloth look amazing, and the cheerleader&#39;s expression is spot-on, especially with that missing tooth. I would recommend other figures in this series just because of how good the other figs are, but this one wouldn&#39;t be a bad&nbsp;pickup either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has single-sided torso printing with a tattered dress and gray skin, a tattered looking skirt print that includes side-printing on the legs for her visible knees and more of the skirt and the pom pom accessories are great with a rich dark green and white colour.</p>

<p>Overall I love this Zombie character. It&#39;s one of the best minifugres in the Series in my opinion and I strongly recommend army building her if you can. Everything about her is great and her parts will indeed be very useful for MOC fans.</p>
