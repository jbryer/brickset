"8BrickMario","2015-09-06T01:20:39.227Z","Purrfect? Or is she a cat-astrophe?","<p>This figure is...odd. She&#39;s probably intended to be a simultaneous ripoff of Catwoman and Cheetah, but to older audiences, she gives off a very different vibe. Still, I thought she was worth getting as she has a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>&nbsp;of printing, and is very colorful.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is very nice, with a stormy background and lime green accents. The information boxes on the back of the packet have tattered edges, which is a nice touch.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Her parts are very limited, with the most useful being her black whip. Her hair is clearly designed to be used for Julie Newmar&#39;s&nbsp;Catwoman, but we&#39;re getting it here first. She reuses Scratchy&#39;s tail from the first Simpsons series, but the tiger printing isn&#39;t very useful at all.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple as can be.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>She&#39;s okay. for what she&#39;s supposed to be. She has stripes&nbsp;<em>everywhere</em>, on her legs, her arms, her back, and both sides of her tail. Her hair is nicely molded, appearing for now in Dark Orange. The yellow paint on her ears isn&#39;t perfect, as the orange bleeds through. My biggest problem with her is this: If she&#39;s supposed to be a tiger/human hybrid, why are her face and hands yellow? Is it supposed to allow her to be used as a costumed person as well? I wish she was all the yellow-orange color, as she would look better and it would give us some new minifigure&nbsp;part colors.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This one stands out well in a crowd, but it doesn&#39;t know what it&#39;s supposed to be. By keeping the possibility of her being a human, it makes the design less clean and certainly more awkward when the whip is added. I wish I liked her more, but she&#39;s flawed. I recommend her to fans of the costumed characters, but my personal opinion is that she could be better.</p>

"ThoughtLash","2015-09-27T01:01:37.3Z","Stealing the other guy's title: Purrfect","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Tiger Woman came in a blue, metallic bag featuring 9 of 16 (sounds like a Borg!) minifigs from the line in rain.&nbsp; The instructions consisted of the basic minifigs checklist.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Tiger Woman&#39;s hair is clearly a reference to the 60&#39;s Catwoman, especially with the ears.&nbsp; The rest of the parts resemble a tiger-striped version of Catwoman, down to the whip.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Tiger Woman is one of my favorite Collectible Minifigures, as a Catwoman and tiger&nbsp;fan she&#39;s great.&nbsp; She has a lot of detail, a LOT of stripes, and a somewhat-uncommon accesory.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple, just assembling a minifig.&nbsp; Very quick.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>See &#39;Minifigures.&#39;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend her, especially to Batman fans.</p>

<p>The costume being worn here could just be a character in costume, she doesn&#39;t look very monstrous, her expression is a smile without any visible carnivorous cat-like teeth, so she could just be in make-up with a decent costume for Halloween. A very curious looking Garfield cosplayer perhaps.</p>

<p>This figure is a definite must have and I strongly recommend her, she&#39;s got a great torso and leg print with side-printing on the legs and the arms. Her hairpiece is very useful and her torso is double-sided. Honestly I really think that she&#39;d make some great MOC costume attendees for a Halloween Party and I hope this print is re-used in different colours for a Cheetah costume next time. Anyway, if you missed out on her, try to find one for your collection.</p>

"Fauch","2016-02-15T17:46:10.707Z","Awesome fig","<p>CMFs are very hit and miss imo, but this one is definitely a hit.</p>

<p>The tiger woman is a costumed fig as she is wearing a belt and has bright yellow hands and head. I think her costume is flame-yellowish orange. The printing is not the most intricate but it&#39;s still great, the whole front, whole side, and the back side of the torso are printed as well as the tail and it just looks flawless overall.</p>

<p>The only little flaw is the ears are a slightly different color than the body, they aren&#39;t as vibrant.</p>

<p>Both the tail and whip are made of a rubbery material. I think the tail may be the easiest way to identify it in the bag because of its undulated shape. The whip is a giveaway as well but it took me a very long time before I managed to feel it through the bag.</p>

<p>Overall one of the greatest Lego Figs I&#39;ve seen, certainly in my top 10.</p>

"ninbricks","2017-09-13T16:14:22.533Z","well... I call her TIGRA!!!","<p>Is it only me, or is there anybody else thinking: &quot;what the hell, they made a collectable minifigure from a MARVEL-character!!!&quot; They made TIGRA!</p>

<p>O.K., she is a little bit sweeter and child-friendly than the comic-counterpart, but hey, it&#39;s LEGO. I really like the printing details on the face, torso, arms and legs as well as the hairpiece with those tiger-ears. She really fits into any costume-party-typed scenery, as well as into a MARVEL-focused creation. Maybe in the future, we might get an official TIGRA-minifigure, but until that day, this minifigure is...TIGRA!</p>
