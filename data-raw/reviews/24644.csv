However, I&#39;ve waited on reviewing him, because I lost one of his pieces and had to replace it in order to review the complete&nbsp;minifigure honestly.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I quite like the Series 14 packaging, as the design is suitably spooky while the green accents make it stand out. The checklist looks good, too.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is the only Minifigure in the series to get two new molds, and they&#39;re very nice. His cranium is new, depicting pointy ears, a rounded skull, a large brow, and goat-like horns. His wings will be very useful once they&#39;re inevitably made available in more colors. His torso and head could conceivably be used for other statue minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is another perfect design. It captures a gargoyle statue so well. He really looks like he&#39;s made of stone, as his only two colors are light grey and dark grey, and there&#39;s some nice speckling and cracking detail to make him look like a weathered statue. Despite the CGI rendering in the corner showing a blank cranium, the piece is actually printed with more speckling and a crack down the left side. Another crack appears on his left arm and there&#39;s one on his torso, which is simply printed but looks great. His face is fantastic, with upward pointing fangs and a piglike nose, and a great scowling expression. The wings and legs are unprinted, which is a shame, but he looks great anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is another fantastic design to come out of Series 14. I would highly recommend him for perching atop buildings or joining the other monsters.</p>

"Hylocera","2015-11-30T04:06:49.56Z","Umadbro?","<p>If you were wondering about the title, just look at the gargoyle&#39;s face...the face says it all.</p>

<p>Out of the three Halloween CMF&#39;s I picked up (Zombie Businessman, Zombie Cheerleader, and this one), this little guy is probably my favorite, albeit by a small margin...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I really like the design of this guy. The wings look superb, as does the headpiece and everything else, really. The crack on his torso is a nice touch. I also like all the &quot;stone carving&quot; detail on his face. The headpiece reminds me of that dude from the Dragon Age cinematic trailer, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the piece was used to make a minifig version of that character. The piece is an excellent mold, with spiral horns and pointy ears, and probably the biggest bonus of this piece is that it does not make the gargoyle&#39;s head look excessively tall or fat, as some headpieces tend to do.</p>

<p>Really my only problem with this guy is a general one, and that is that the short legs are immovable. I hope that at some point LEGO can figure out a way to make short legs movable. They&#39;ve pulled off more incredible feats in the past...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The gargoyle might not stand out among his peers with the quality of the Halloween series being so high. He might not be as flashy as the ghost or the man-eating plant suit guy, but he is a quality figure in his own right; as well-designed a figure as any.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-05T02:09:58.243Z","We Are Gargoyles!","<p><strong>Set #71010 Gargoyle:</strong> This particular minifigure is one that I feel is in high-demand. The overall design looks great with some impressive stone detail work on the torso and headpiece print. His new wing pack looks great and the short legs really make him look like a decent monster character.</p>

<p>The biggest problem I have with this Gargoyle is the facial expression. It looks too similar to a stone goblin with a hint of bat creature thrown in, now of course I know that Gargoyles are traditionally quite horrific in appearance and there isn&#39;t much wrong with a goblin/bat hybrid for the facial expression, I just feel that it looks too bland for the character when much better facial prints have come out from other Themes. It also might have been nice to see this figure get the double-sided facial print treatment with the other side giving him an open and snarling mouth, alas it was not to be.</p>

<p>For this Minifigure I&#39;d strongly recommend trying to get a few, they&#39;d look great for set pieces with Gothic style cathedrals or castles and the parts are pretty useful. Definitely worth tracking down if you missed this series.</p>

<h3>Packaging/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Packaging is a black bag with some grey question marks on it. The front illustrates some of the possible minifigures available i series 14. The sheet shows all 16 minifigures with some help on how to join the parts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set has some very nice parts to it. It gives us a cool wing piece in light grey and a stone like headpiece that I believe is exclusive to the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The gargoyle has light grey short legs. His torso is light grey with some darker details. I really like the crack detailing on his torso. Surprisingly his arms have some printing on&nbsp;them. It is some dots with a crack detailing on one of them. His wing piece is in light grey and looks really good. The wing piece is a little loose on mine. The head is really nice. It has some detailing to show teeth and a mouth and then eyes. He has some more crack detailing on him. The head piece is amazing. It is quite similar to the faun minifigure but a little different. It has ears and horns with some dots and cracks for detailing.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great minifigure. Hes not my favorite but he is definitely close. This series has some great figures in it.</p>
