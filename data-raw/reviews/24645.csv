<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is great, and really stands out on the shelves...that is, if they&#39;re still&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;the shelves! These guys are really popular!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some very nice parts, and many of them could be useful. His skeleton suit can be given to other characters outside of a Halloween context, or be used to make a few film characters.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very easy, as he&#39;s just a minifigure.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I love this. He&#39;s a very clever&nbsp;take on the real-world skeleton suits worn on Halloween, as his costume uses the bones of a skeleton minifigure! His head shows a skull-shaped mask held on by string. His eyes and a bit of his yellow skin can be seen through the eye holes. The best thing about the head is that the string is printed all the way around it, and shown tied up in the back. The last time they printed a minifigure&#39;s head 360 degrees was with Alfred in the 2006 Batcave! He&#39;s got more printing on the sides of his arms and legs, his back, and his toes. The only problem is that the front of his legs do not show the leg bones, only the sides. They do show the hips, though! The white printing is fairly&nbsp;strong despite the black background, which I appreciate. What I like the most is his pumpkin trick-or-treat bucket! It&#39;s an ingenious reuse of the Leprechaun&#39;s clay pot, in orange with a smiling jack-o-lantern design. It&#39;s also the first time the piece has been used with a handle, which is black.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this one. He&#39;s a clever design with a lot of detail, and I don&#39;t mind that he&#39;s not a real monster. He&#39;s a great one to have, so I recommend getting him!</p>

<p>This minifigure is out and about in a world of monsters hoping to score some candy on Halloween Night, making him the Minifig in a Costume for this Series. The print is just goregous, he&#39;s got arm printing, leg printing and a double-sided torso with the brilliant print of a LEGO Skeleton on a black body suit, a staple of Halloween costumes in the real world realized perfectly in LEGO form.</p>

<p>His candy bucket is a great looking accessory and a very nice new part that will be very welcome, well new print on an old part, I believe this could be the Leprechaun&#39;s pot of gold element, though I&#39;m not 100% sure on that.</p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend getting this one if you missed out on it, get multiples for some awesome MOC display potential for a great Halloween Theme.</p>
