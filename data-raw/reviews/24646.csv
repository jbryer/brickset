<p>The packaging is very nice. Since this series has its own logo, the &quot;Series 14&quot; seal had to be moved down to the lower right.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Zombie Businessman has some very nice parts, but the only useful one is his new hairpiece. I look forward to seeing where it will be reused in the future. I wouldn&#39;t recommend using the briefcase. The opening hinge is made of a very thin plastic, and is prone to breaking. I&#39;d recommend finding a sturdier one and replacing it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Again, it&#39;s pretty easy to assemble a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like him! His hair is a nice new piece, being neatly combed on the left and messy on the right. His face shows a worried expression.&nbsp;His glasses are crooked and its&nbsp;left lens has been shattered! His suit is dark blue, but its numerous rips and tatters show the lighter blue shirt underneath. His jacket is slightly open and torn on its&nbsp;left side. His tie is dark grey. His shirt has become untucked on its left. On his right arm, there is a large tear in the jacket. All around his outfit are specks of gray dirt. His newspaper is &quot;The Zombie Times&quot; and the frontpage article is &quot;BRAAAINS!&quot;, showing a photograph of a brain below it. Intriguingly, the logo for the newspaper contains Toxikita&#39;s symbol from the Ultra Agents theme.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a really nice design. He&#39;s well detailed and he&#39;s got some personality to him. I&#39;d recommend getting him. I&#39;ll probably be&nbsp;putting him with his daughter, the Zombie Cheerleader or his great-uncle, the Zombie Pirate.</p>

"Hylocera","2015-11-30T03:57:21.607Z","He Just Wanted to Read...","<p>All this zombie wanted to do was read his paper, but with&nbsp;the shape his glasses are in, that might be difficult...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with all CMF&#39;s, the zombie businessman is highly detailed, with a zombie newspaper, beat-up suit, smashed glasses, and messy hair. I think the hairpiece is new, and I really like its messy look, a look which fits a zombie. It and the briefcase are probably the only two parts usable outside of a zombie theme.</p>

<p>My favorite piece here is probably the head. The printing is superb, and the glasses are a fantastic touch, especially with the shatter effects on the right lens. His expression reminds me of Eeyore - a somehow lovable depressed look.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I prefer the suspense of a random set to feeling bags for the figs I want, and although there were some figs in this series I would have preferred to this guy, he still holds his own as a well-designed figure. The little things in this set, like the newspaper name/heading and the cracked glasses, really show that TLG put lots of thought into his design.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-17T19:18:09.26Z","Working 9-5 for Brains...","<p><strong>Set #71010 Zombie Businessman:</strong> The Zombie is highly desirable from many fans of classic horror and just horror in general. So creating a bunch of brand new versions of one here and with Monster Fighters meant that LEGO had a sure-fire winner on their hands.</p>

<p>The Zombie Businessman has a brilliant print with a very nice tattered suit and tie look, there&#39;s even a printed arm to show rips and tears there and on the legs. One side of his glasses is smashed preventing you from seeing the eye behind it. His accessories work well too, a black suitcase and a tile printed with newspaper elements. The Zombie Times</p>

<p>Overall this minifigure is great, right up there with any other Zombies that LEGO has made, so I&#39;d strongly recommend getting him if you missed out back when Series 14 was put on the shelves.</p>
