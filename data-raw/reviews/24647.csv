<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging for this series is pretty standard, using a black rainy backdrop with lime green accenting it. This matches the Scooby-Doo boxes, which this shares shelf space with, so I appreciate that. The sheet inside contains the usual checklist and MMO code, but a very welcome addition is the set of textile instructions, showing you how to put on the capes of the Spider Lady and Specter, and the skirt of the Wacky Witch.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Banshee has some very unique parts. Her hairpiece is a new mold, and is the first LEGO hairpiece to be cast in a translucent color, in this case, trans-black. Her face and hands are the first to be cast in Light Aqua. Her ghostly bottom is a recolor of the Ninjago&nbsp;piece, but with trans-clear as the base color with streaks of Sand Green. This piece makes her over a head taller than a regular minifigure.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the stand provided only allows her to be centered when the stand is sideways.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple, especially as she&#39;s got only four parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What a fantastic minifigure!&nbsp;I&#39;m glad to finally get a female ghost from LEGO, and such a humanoid one, too. Her colors go very well together, and her printing is superb. The hairpiece is very unique and its translucency&nbsp;definitely adds to her appearance. I also appreciate that she&#39;s an unhappy spirit rather than a malicious one, as that&#39;s much closer to the traditional Irish folklore.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is such a perfect execution of an unexpected character. I would highly recommend her to anyone who likes the series. She&#39;s great as a banshee or a generic ghost, so she&#39;s overall a very nice minifigure to have.&nbsp;</p>

"NBJ2016","2015-09-19T19:47:48.107Z","71010: Banshee","<p>I picked up the Banshee today while shopping, and it is one of the best Collectable Minifigures I have ever owned. Banshees are typically ghosts who wail and shriek when sadness or misfortune enters a house, but gaining a minifigure Banshee is certainly not either of those things.</p>

<p><strong><em>Packaging and Leaflet...</em></strong></p>

<p>The packaging is black, and shows nine of the sixteen minifigures against a thunderstorm background. The Banshee is not present, sadly. The LEGO, Minifigures, Monsters and Series 14 logo appear, as well as the &#39;1 Minifigure Included&#39; warning, the age range and set number. The back of the packaging has rectangles of lime green with torn edges, in which the barcode and usual warnings are present.</p>

<p>The leaflet has the usual checklist, which declares the Banshee to be Minifigure 14. By random chance, this is the first Series 14 minifigure I&#39;m reviewing, and the 14th minifigure on the checklist. The back of the leaflet gives you your LEGO Minifigures Online code, and instructions on how to attach the capes for the Spider Lady and Specter, and the skirt of the Wacky Witch.</p>

<p><em><strong>Parts</strong></em></p>

<p>The parts are all amazing. When opening the packet and tipping the contents out, nobody could possibly be disappointed. The hair is a new element coloured in Transparent Brown. The head has an amazing print, and the Light Aqua colour only helps the effect. The torso design is simple, but that makes it attractive and special. Amazing work on that. The tail is a recolour of the new Ninjago ghost base, Transparent, with accents of Sand Green. I doubt that TLG could have given us a better parts assortment for a Banshee.</p>

<p><em><strong>The build</strong></em></p>

<p>The building is over in a matter of seconds, as it is with all Collectable Minifigures.</p>

<p><em><strong>The completed Minifigure</strong></em></p>

<p>The Banshee is an amazing Minifigure to behold. The colours go together far better than anyone could imagine. The most amazing thing is that she looks like one of the best minifigures in Series 14 from the pictures, but she looks so much more stunning in reality. If we get a better female ghost than this in the future, I will be very much surprised. There is only one fault with this minifigure, and that is the tail. Unfortunately, the Banshee can only be in the middle of the 3x4 baseplate when she is sideways on, so you will need a 1x2 jumper plate to place her on to fix this problem.</p>

<p><em><strong>Overall opinion</strong></em></p>

<p>The Banshee is the best ghost TLG has ever created. When I first saw this minifigure, I knew I wanted her, but she has shot past my expectations. The bottom line is: if kids in your house want one, buy at least one for yourself and never let them touch it.</p>

<p><em><strong>My Rating: 10 / 10.</strong></em></p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-17T19:23:59.8Z","Spectral Tears of Ireland","<p><strong>Set #71010 Banshee:</strong> Not much going for this minifigure, she doesn&#39;t even include any accessories, however she has a nice bit of charm and looks very fun.</p>

<p>The Banshee includes some nice new pieces, her tail is the spectral piece introduced here and with LEGO Ninjago vs. the Ghosts, it&#39;s a lovely looking piece full of some holes and an interesting looking shape to make a wispy spectral lower body. Her torso is a nice sand green with a dual-sided print for her tattered looking dress. Her hair piece is smoky black and would go on to be used for Dana Barret in the LEGO Ghostbusters Firehouse set. Her single-sided facial print shows that she is crying tears and her mouth is open to unleash a ghastly wail.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend her mostly for tail piece. She&#39;s not a strong figure, however if you want the entire set you&#39;ll need her and she does stand out as being rather unique. I do wish she had some kind of accessory though.</p>
