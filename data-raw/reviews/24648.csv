<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes as every collectable minifigure in a bag, which makes you able to feel (if you try very hard) which figure might be inside...</p>

<p>Instructions need no explaining I believe, it&#39;s just one minifigure</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Square Foot is a reference to the legend of Big Foot which was only captured in photo&#39;s/video&#39;s and is never proven to really exist but there surely&nbsp;is a lot of mystery around this &#39;human-ape-like creature&#39;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Straight-forward: a minifigure with one accessory. Very simple.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>You get Square Foot which is a plain chocolate brown minifigure with tanned hands. His head is one piece which fits on the torso and covers part of his upper body. The head includes printed eyes, eyebrows and a big pair of teeth! On the back of his head there is some nice&nbsp;molded detail of his hair.&nbsp;His feet are also printed with toes, which is a nice extra detail. As accessory,&nbsp;Square&nbsp;Foot comes&nbsp;with a camera which is a nice joke by LEGO since the real creature has only been photographed (but never catched or seen up close), but now it seems he himself also likes to spot humans perhaps...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Fans of Big Foot can finally put Chewbacca back in the Millennium Falcon since he was acting as a stunt double for Square Foot in their LEGO town. I have always been fascinated by Legends like UFO&#39;s, the Loch Ness monster and Big Foot. I&#39;m glad to say I can finally add this set to my collection as Big Foot can now be a legend in my own&nbsp;LEGO City. Who will spot him in the woods...</p>

"8BrickMario","2015-09-26T21:53:45.603Z","Say Cheese!","<p>I was excited to know that LEGO was making a Bigfoot-er, Square Foot minifigure after they had made the Yeti.&nbsp;Is this one better?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packagaing for this series is very nicely designed, and stands out well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this one are very limited, due to the character they represent. He reuses the Yeti&#39;s head piece.&nbsp;If you need a minifigure camera, this is a nice way to get one.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple as always.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a good execution of Bigfoot. But it&#39;s not perfect. The torso is completely blank, whereas the Yeti before had fur printed on it, and the legs don&#39;t have any, either. This might be to make the cold-weather Yeti look hairier, but it just makes this one underwhelming. He has Dark Nougat hands, which are uncommon, and some toes printed on his toe area in the same color. The best part is his accessory- a camera! I was hoping LEGO would include one, and I was not disappointed. It&#39;s just such an amusing idea, to have the subject of famous photographs be an amateur photographer himself!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this one&#39;s a decent minifigure, but it could be a bit better. Still, he&#39;s a great touch to any forest, so I would recommend picking him up.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-17T19:29:29.847Z","Sightings Reported everywhere in LEGO City National Park","<p><strong>Set #71010 Square Foot:</strong> A pretty funny idea and a good re-use of the parts first seen with the Yeti. However Square Foot is a bit weak compared to some of the other unique looking monsters in the Series.</p>

<p>Aside from the printing on his face you&#39;ll only find printing on the fronts of his feet for his toes. This LEGO version of Big Foot is very plain, his hands are pretty good though for MOC fans, since it is a rare colour compared to what we&#39;re used to seeing. He&#39;s got a camera for an accessory, a bit of tongue-in-cheek reference to the fact that no-one has ever gotten a good picture of Big Foot, if Big Foot truly exists.</p>

<p>Overall I find myself lukewarm to Square Foot, he&#39;s cute and a bit of fun as a novelty. The only problem is he isn&#39;t much to talk about. Mildly recommended for folks looking to get all 16 characters.</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2018-12-07T21:16:35.03Z","Bigfoot","<p>I&#39;m just going to give a quick overview of this figure.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Head: he has a molded&nbsp;head, the same as the series 11 yeti but in brown.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Torso: he has a plain brown torso with no printing, and medium nougat hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Legs: He has plain brown legs except for some toes printed onto the feet, which look really good.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He also comes with a camera as an accesory.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Play: I have enjoyed playing with this figure a little, and there are quite a few good story opportunities present.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Display: he also has good display value as he is fairly detailed, although perhaps not as detailed as some other CMF characters. I have also found him useful for adding an extra bit of charm to forest MOCs.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Price: he can still be found for only $4 or cheaper on bricklink, which I believe represents pretty good value.</p>

<p>Summary: This is an excellent minifigure, and I feel confident recomending him.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hope you find this review helpful!</p>
