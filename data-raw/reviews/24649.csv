<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is rather nice, using black and a bright lime green. The checklist has an MMO code on the back, as well as instructions for the capes and skirt on their corresponding figures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this figure aren&#39;t that versatile, but they&#39;re very nice. Her beehive hair is a reuse of Velma Staplebot&#39;s, which I never got, so I&#39;m happy to have it now, in black. Her cape is very nice. The entire cape is two pieces of thin translucent clear&nbsp;plastic, which come in a sheet and have to be punched out. The lower cape is the same shape as Batman&#39;s, while the collar is a new shape with a scalloped edge. Both are covered with black lines in a spider web pattern. Her accessory is a red spider, which is nice to have, but not very rare.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very easy, but aligning the cape&#39;s parts took a few seconds.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>She&#39;s great. I love the spider motif (even though she&#39;s a vampire...) and she&#39;s got quite a presence. Her dress looks really nice with the red details, and she&#39;s got a very subtle gold necklace around her neck. The spiders on her dress and her hair are silver, which probably means they&#39;re jewelry. Her face is nice, with her shaded purple eye shadow and her calm but sinister smile. Her cape looks fantastic, and really adds to her look. Her whole appearance is slightly over-the-top, but in a good way.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like her. Her design reminds me of Willa the Witch, who also had spiders on her clothes, and she&#39;s very unique among the other LEGO vampires. I think she&#39;s a great one to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Featuring a black version of the beehive hair piece with a web printed into it and a fang-filled smile for her facial expression on a pale face, the Spider Lady really stands out to me. Her dress is webbed and features silver spider detailing and the unique piece used for her cape looks very impressive. She includes a red spider for an accessory and comes off as very creepy and very sexy for a LEGO Minfigure.</p>

<p>I&#39;d strongly recommend this one, she&#39;s a great figure and could almost pass for Elvira, or some alternate version of Morticia Addams.</p>
