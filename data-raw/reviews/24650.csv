<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>What you see is what you get. &nbsp;Legs, Torso, Head, Top of Head and a Guitar (not&nbsp;to mention the plate he stands on). &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The guy is well printed. &nbsp;For the legs it looks like he is wearing blue jeans and some &quot;metal&quot; shoes. &nbsp;The guitar does have a bat printed on it (if you have not figured it out by now). &nbsp;The head does have eyebrows printed on it if you&nbsp;do want to change his &quot;hair&quot; out for some thing else. &nbsp;And for&nbsp;last the torso it is printed all over the front, back and the arms. &nbsp;It is a &quot;blue jean vest&quot; with a black shirt underneath, on the back of the torso are the words &quot;SHOCK &#39;n&#39; ROCK&quot; on what looks like some sort of patch. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This figure looks like it will be common enough, to find fairly&nbsp;easy. &nbsp;And if you are like me and do not have a &quot;Frankenstein Monster&quot;, he is a must get figure for your collection. &nbsp;If you&nbsp;are&nbsp;using the feel method to find him I would feel for the &quot;guitar&quot; and / or&nbsp;&quot;top of the head&quot; (to locate him). &nbsp;</p>

<p>The packaging is attractive and eye-catching. The contents are far more exciting.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this one are actually pretty good. The guitar is useful, and his forehead is a more realistic option for the Monster in the Monster Fighters theme. His outfit could also be reused.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very very easy.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t love the general idea, but there are some really nice touches. His arms are great, since they are dual-molded and printed! The black sleeves have a bit of printed tattering, and both of his wrists are stitched up. On the back of his denim vest, it says &quot;Shock &#39;N Roll&quot;, which is amusing. His guitar is slightly spooky with the bat-wing design. His face is a bit cheesy, but this minifigure is not meant to be used in scary scenes.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s okay. He&#39;s still at the bottom of my list, but I don&#39;t have any complaints other than the fact that he doesn&#39;t interest me. I imagine a lot of people will be skipping him, but if you want him, go for it.</p>

<p>His torso features dual-molded arms with some great subtle printing that hides this fact. His front is printed with a padlock on a chain over his t-shirt while on the back you have the band name Shock &#39;n&#39; Roll. His legs feature some great blue-jean print with steel toed shoes and his face has a very suitable looking expression for a rock &#39;n&#39; roll guitar player.</p>

<p>His guitar accessory has a nice printed bat detail on it and he definitely stands out as one of the better ones from the series. I&#39;d definitely recommend tracking him down if you missed out on him, multiples would be nice too for MOC figs to add to his band.</p>
