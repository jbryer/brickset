<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The image on the bag makes the most of this micro fighter.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>23 small parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>With only 23 parts the build takes less than a minute, but has some clever part usage.</p>

<p>The Light Saber&nbsp;Handles work well as the four laser canons.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Although this is a micro fighter it is&nbsp;still not quite in scale with either the Death Star One or Two. Quite possibly this is about the right scale to go with a Star Destroyer?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Only really worth while for Die Hard Star Wars fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>There are no normal instructions, but honestly, who needs one for such a small set. There is something like instructions in the magazine, though. The foil pack this comes in is interesting, because you don&#39;t have to rip it to get to parts. On back of it there&#39;s a part that&#39;s closed with just glue, so you can open AND close it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>23 simple parts.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Less than a minute.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>.....It&#39;s a X-wing! It looks really simple, but it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s wings can move up and down a little. It has a blue stud in the middle to represent an astromech.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great gift, but only if you are also interested in the magazine itself.&nbsp;There&#39;s a poster of Yoda and Kanan Jarrus in it, if anyone is interested. It&#39;s not worth buying a magazine just for this model, though.</p>

<p>This rebel alliance T-65 X-wing is a very meaningful set to me as it was something I played with for days when I got it back in summer 2015 .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build revolves around a red 1&times;2 double sided snot brick , with clips , then modified plates , then lightsaber hilts&nbsp;for the main barrels , the cockpit is an indented snot brick with a dark Trans cheese slope for the window , the nose is some bricks stacked and and cheese slope to top it off .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very playable set and looks decent on display not a set for everyone but I still think it is fairly decent .</p>
