"ryan_c_byrd","2022-07-10T22:04:36.47Z","Found late, but just in time for the 90th anniversary set.","<p>As a kid, I never had the set this is based on, though it looked cool back then.&nbsp; But I saw this set/book after it was unavailable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Lots of detail for its size.</p>

<p>Includes shapes and functions from the source material (good representation).</p>

<p>Easy to source parts.</p>

<p>Lots cheaper than the original.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>To get it, you often get a book you may not want.</p>

<p>Paper instructions are not so easy to get.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>This set makes a good small replacement for the original.&nbsp; Of course, the new 90th anniversary set blows it out of the water. But, if you want a small version to hang from string that can be built with easily sourced parts, this fits the bill.</p>
