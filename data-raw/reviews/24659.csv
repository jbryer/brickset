I, luckily, ended up purchasing both that and this Level Pack to build up my LEGO Ghostbusters collection and I could not be happier with this set&#39;s design and what it unlocks in the game.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like all LEGO Dimensions sets, the instruction booklet has&nbsp;nothing more than&nbsp;the minifigure&#39;s directions. Unless you have the game itself or&nbsp;access to LEGO.com&#39;s instructions, there will be no building the vehicle/gadget for you. This time though, you do get instructions for Peter Venkman&#39;s proton pack, so if you haven&#39;t memorized how to build that&nbsp;tedious little thing&nbsp;by now, this should help. What&#39;s worth noting, though, is that the clip piece that holds the Heatsink blaster (represented with a black lightsaber hilt) is black instead of the usual dark-bluish&nbsp;gray from the other two sets. It looks a lot better that way, too.</p>

<p>Trapezoid Box is trapezoid, nothing to say there.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 115 assorted parts to this Level Pack, and the majority of them go to the miniature Ecto-1 and Ghost Trap builds, (with a few going to the Proton Pack) both of which come with a great assortment of parts, especially the Ghost Trap. Under the actual trap is a little disc&nbsp;that is transparent purple, and it has a wonderfully detailed little ring of electricity printed on it. I&#39;ve seen a similar piece to&nbsp;this all the way back in 2002 in a Harry Potter set called Dumbledore&#39;s Office. It&#39;s truly a great piece and is a very good addition to anybody wanting some detailing for a magic/sci-fi moc. Other than that, a lot of the other pieces are white and red basic bricks built up for the car and the trap respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Doctor Peter Venkman is the only minifigure in this set, though he doesn&#39;t disappoint. While this is the most common Ghostbuster amongst the three sets, in the original Ecto-1 his design was heavily flawed, (featuring no arm printing and a very poor-looking hairpiece) and in the Firehouse he is covered in slime. This makes for a good addition to a very narrow array of Ghostbusters MOCs, but in line with the others he looks out of place on a shelf or posed in a way that doesn&#39;t suggest he was just attacked by something sticky and gross. This set gives us that perfect Peter Venkman, one that looks great next to the three other&nbsp;Firehouse Ghostbusters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In game, he unlocks the Ghostbusters level (Titled &quot;Ghostbusters!&quot;) which is a MUCH more fun and accurate representation of the original movie&nbsp;than the highly disappointing Back to the Future Level Pack. It had a lot of exploration incorporated into it, as there is a huge chunk of New York&#39;s streets available to the player, and a lot of fun Ghost Busting. The final boss battle was also probably the funniest in the entire game.</p>

<p>After the level, you are transported to the free-roam&nbsp;Realm of Ghostbusters which is VERY well done. I feel like giving you anymore information on it would spoil the surprise, so I will refrain from giving out details, but if you&#39;re a Ghostbusters fan, you will not be disappointed with the world you are given to explore. You can also cycle through the other three Ghostbusters whilst playing as Venkman, effectively eliminating the need for any future Fun/Team Packs involving the rest of the team. This could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on how you take it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The two aforementioned builds are the Ecto-1 and the Ghost Trap. The Ecto-1 is a bit of a mixed bag for me, but only just. It looks really cute and plays just like any other Dimensions vehicle. It&#39;s likeness to the original is astonishing given its size, and it makes for wonderful pictures and perhaps MOC&#39;s&nbsp;too. The big problem I have with it is that it has no back wheels, which I was afraid of after seeing it for the first time in pictures a few&nbsp;months ago. Instead it has a rounded underside-disc&nbsp;that keeps it level and makes play smooth, which I guess isn&#39;t so bad. It looks better from the front than the back but overall it&#39;s probably my third favorite Dimensions vehicle, right behind the Mystery Machine and the Delorean. The alternative builds are the &quot;Ecto-1 Blaster&quot; (sort of a tank-like design) and the &quot;Ecto-1 Water Diver.&quot; (a submarine) Our of the three, I&#39;m gonna have to pick the first design over the latter two, but they aren&#39;t too shabby either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve stated above that the Ghost Trap has a great little piece in it, but it has more than that to hold its weight. It opens just like the film&#39;s own Traps and it comes apart in two pieces, one resembling the Trap itself and one resembling the Containment Unit. This is build up with red modified bricks (indented 1 x 1&#39;s with a stud on the side and a hole in the back) and it has a nice black whip piece and a yellow lever. It&#39;s two redesigns are the &quot;Ghost Stun &#39;n Trap&quot; (a gadget that stuns enemies and traps ghost, which looks like it has a fishing line being dragged into the gates of Hell. And actually, that looks really cool) and the &quot;Proton Zapper.&quot; (a cannon) Personally, I find that last design really stupid and unnecessary for any kind of play. It&#39;s exactly like Legolas&#39;s&nbsp;bow cannon, being stationary and using projeciles. I&#39;d pick the first two models over that one anyday.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Altogether, with the amazing Level, the amazing Dimension, the great minifigure and models, I&#39;d say this is a must have for not only Ghostbusters fans, but just straight up Dimensions fans. You get access to a lot of fun features and gets you one step closer to that ever-so-elusive 100% on LEGO Dimensions, considering there are Ghostly Swarms in so many different levels.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set. Yeah, its a Level Pack which means its really overpriced to its piece count, but the in-game material it unlocks is just too good to pass up. Get it while you can!</p>

<p>4/5</p>

"8BrickMario","2016-01-24T23:56:58.18Z","Is it good? Or is it a bust?","<p>Ghostbusters! A great movie that has stood the test of time and become a classic. Has Dimensions done it justice?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is nice, showing Venkman firing a proton beam, the Ivo Shandor-built apartment building, and the scene where Zuul blows out the large windowed wall. The models and Venkman himself are shown off nicely.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are okay, with the standouts being the car front, the 2x2 portal dish recycled from Ultra Agents&nbsp;and the 2x2 bow with the Ghostbusters&#39; logo. Venkman&#39;s stand is nicely decorated with his uniform and nametag.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Dr. Peter Venkman is the minifigure here, and he&#39;s significantly improved since his Ideas appearance in the Ecto-1. Most of this is aided by his new hairpiece (which he shares with the Twelfth Doctor), which captures Bill Murray&#39;s hairstyle quite well. His arms add&nbsp;a &quot;No Ghosts&quot; patch on the right, a shoulder pocket on the left, and two darker patches on the elbows. He comes equipped with his proton pack, which hasn&#39;t changed. Note that this set is the only way to get the &quot;standard&quot; updated Venkman, as his minifigure in the HQ is slimed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is okay, but it&#39;s disappointing that the Ecto-1&#39;s side panels have taken over the space for back wheels.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The models here are pretty nice! The Ecto-1 manages to look just like the vehicle (sans back wheels), but I feel that there&#39;s a bit too much white. Some printing on the sides might have broken up the colors a bit.&nbsp;<br />
The ghost trap (with a part of the containment unit) is another great model. While totally out of scale, it&#39;s a great representation, and the top is hinged so it can open just like it does in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>The Ghostbusters&nbsp;are so much fun to play as! Wait, did I say Ghostbuster<strong>s</strong>? That&#39;s right, beating the level will allow you to play as any member of the team. Bringing up the character wheel will cause the player icon to cycle through the four Ghostbusters, and you can select whichever one you want. Some dislike the inability to have all four on screen, but I think it would be really redundant and ultimately just an aesthetic thing to have all four, so I think this is fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, their main ability is to use the proton pack. The proton beam will explode gold LEGO, throw NPCs and enemies into a swirling proton sphere until they fall apart, and it can be used to clear ghosts. Approaching a swarm of ghosts and firing a beam will gradually gather them into a ball, and when the meter is full, they can be moved into the now-open ghost trap. The trap can then be picked up and placed into containment units to power machines and solve puzzles when required. This is a very satisfying game mechanic, as the speed of the capture conveys the struggle, and the combination of character and gadget speaks of Dimensions&#39; integration strengths.</p>

<p>Another minor ability is to perform a quick proton spin attack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ecto-1 is a pretty standard vehicle, so not much to say there.</p>

<p>The Ghostbusters level is a lot of fun. It retells the story of the film, and, though restricted by archive recordings, manages to use them well, changing the context of certain quotes. Of course, LEGO&#39;s trademark silliness has entered here, too, and the kitchen scene has been hilariously redone in LEGO&#39;s style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The adventure world opened up by Venkman is also a lot of fun. All of the signature locations like the HQ, library, apartment building,&nbsp;museum, and even the RMS Titanic, have been included.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is definitely one of the strongest level packs in the game, and I&#39;d say it&#39;s well worth picking up.&nbsp;</p>

This level is actually called simply Ghostbusters in the game, I think it would have been nice to call it A Spook Central Adventure though&hellip; That being said, this level also has a great soundtrack, the music from the movie plays at perfect moments and you can easily lose yourself just listening along while destroying LEGO objects in a massive section of the streets of New York.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s even some nods to the events of Ghostbusters 2 with the river of slime and a brief mention of Vigo the Carpathian in the dialogue at some point if I recall correctly.
