<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typical box style, with a three-dimensional tongue for Slimer.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are nice, with the manhole cover tile, grey barrel, and translucent&nbsp;bright green studs standing out.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Slimer is the sole minifigure here. He&#39;s molded in translucent bright green plastic. His face is different from the HQ version, having a rounded tongue and a malicious glare, which I feel is unfitting for the character. He has a sausage as an accessory.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The models are all right, though the last one (a manhole blasted open by a jet of slime) is the most creative and appealing to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>Slimer is a very useful character. He can fly and dive, for one, and his small size makes him able to use mini hatches to access different areas. He is the only short character with the&nbsp;illumination ability. He has a boomerang (his sausage), and he can shatter glass with a roar. Slimer is able to clear piles of toxic sludge by gobbling them up, in a much faster time than water sprays.&nbsp;He&#39;s also immune to the repelling effect of ghost swarms.&nbsp;There are a few underwater statues and one underwater ghost swarm that only Slimer can deal with, making him necessary for completion.</p>

<p>When entering vehicles or using gadgets, Slimer will not ride them as a passenger. He&#39;ll possess them instead, causing them to take on a green glow. Unfortunately, the Ghostbusters&#39; proton pack doesn&#39;t affect him any differently than it does other characters.</p>

<p>His gadget(s) aren&#39;t immensely useful, but they&#39;re pretty fun. The last model, the manhole, will rain down a shower of slime to cause a wide range of destruction in its area.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have the level pack, Slimer will grant you access to the Ghostbusters&nbsp;Adventure World.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This pack is pretty fun. Slimer is an enjoyable character to play as, and the pack is necessary for completion. I&#39;d recommend it.</p>

"BlueStation","2017-02-28T01:14:56.173Z","""That's the one that got me.""","<p>Now that I have had a chance to experience and review the <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/51483"">core game</a>, I wanted to highlight several of the key add-on packs that have enhanced LEGO Dimensions for me.</p>

<p>As I remember it, I saw that Slimer would be a fun pack before the Ghostbusters&#39; <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75827-1/Firehouse-Headquarters"">Firehouse Headquarters</a> was announced, so initially this pack was a must-have, to go along with my <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21108-1/Ghostbusters-Ecto-1"">Ecto-1</a>. When I saw that Slimer was included in the Firehouse though, I lost interest in getting the Dimensions version. At the time, I was only scoping out Dimensions packs for the minifigures themselves, when they were rare, exclusive, or missing from my collection.</p>

<p>Once I got the core game however, I read up on some of Slimer&#39;s in-game abilities, and decided to seek out the Slimer pack on sale. This one was actually tougher to track down - it seems to have proved a popular add-on pack, and it&#39;s easy to see why.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The accessory included on the alternate toy tag is labeled as a &quot;Slime Shooter.&quot; The parts consist of a lot of <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/colour-Transparent-Green"">trans-green</a> pieces, including a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-30063"">parabolic element</a> which is not listed in Brickset&#39;s inventory in this color - I don&#39;t know if this is a rare or new element though I know I have not seen one in this color since the early 90s Space days. I love elements like this and trans-green in general, and I imagine it will prove useful in Ghostbusters MOCs.</p>

<p>A printed pressure-meter 1x1 tile and printed grate 2x2 circular tile are included, along with a gray steering wheel and dark gray barrel. Hot dogs are included, as are appropriate for our main hero.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The Slimer minifigure is wonderful, and is about as accurate a representation you will see fitting into the LEGO system. His base fits on two studs, and his face is printed. His arms are already connected to the minifigure and are not separate elements to build.</p>

<p>The design is the exact same as the version included in 75287-1, except for one key detail: the firehouse version is <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/colour-Transparent-Bright-Green"">trans-bright-green</a>, and the Dimensions version, though it&#39;s difficult to tell in the photos, is standard <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/colour-Transparent-Green"">trans-green</a>. Much darker coloring. I love the trans-green version, and I prefer it to the brighter version in the Firehouse, but I don&#39;t think either one is more or less accurate than the other.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>The main draw for me in this set though is that Slimer is really useful in Dimensions! He has a ton of abilities - he can fly, he can dive underwater, he can travel-through or absorb toxic waste, he can throw his hot dogs into Batarang switches, he can sonic-smash glass, he can illuminate dark areas, he can access mini areas, he can pass through swarms of ghosts, etc. It&#39;s a very unique set of abilities, and it&#39;s fun to use. The first time I put him on the game pad, he made that distinctive breathing sound, and I started flying all around with him. I was SLIMER.</p>

<p>I skipped most of the DC packs and hadn&#39;t upgraded some of the vehicles that can fly in different variations, so I hadn&#39;t flown much in-game. It was both helpful for a lot of challenges and exploration, as well as simply fun to do.</p>

<p>When you enter a vehicle as Slimer, he disappears and the vehicle glows green like it&#39;s possessed.</p>

<p>He seems to make a mixture of sound effects that combine different iterations of the character. While he doesn&#39;t outright speak (sometimes mumbling unintelligible sentences), at times his voice recalls the Frank Welker/Real Ghostbusters cartoon version, mixed in with some unmistakable sound effects from the movies (his sonar-smash ability is the roar as Slimer charges Venkman in the first film). Having Venkman and Slimer on the pad at the same time prompts Venkman&#39;s line which titles this review.</p>

<p>I have not used the Slime Shooter much. I have not upgraded it yet to it&#39;s other builds, but it has not had much use for me, if any, in-game. It is fun to spray slime around, however I would have preferred this build to mimic some variation of the Ghostbusters 2 Slime Blowers, the way the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71228-1/Ghostbusters-Level-Pack"">Level Pack</a> includes a version of the Ghost Trap. I could then adapt them into my collection.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend this fun pack. There are in-game challenges that can only be completed by Slimer, but more importantly, he&#39;s one of the most enjoyable characters I&#39;ve had in Dimensions. I feel like I always have him on the toy pad no matter what level I&#39;m in.</p>

<p>Being a Ghostbusters character across all media, he can access both the Ghostbusters (original) and Ghostbusters (2016) Adventure Worlds, so you could skip all the other Ghostbusters packs and still access these worlds with him.</p>

I certainly took my time to get to them, hopefully all of these reviews have been well received. Anyway it&rsquo;s time to put Series 1 to bed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

Slimer is shown prominently on the front of the package with a slime covered table of food, perhaps from the Sedgwick Hotel in the background. Slimer&rsquo;s toy imagery is also expertly done to show off the in-game toy builds on the back next to their physical counterparts and the toy shots on the front. Yep, overall a pretty decent showcase of what to expect while adding a hint of character to the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

You get one large circle plate and a donut plate in grey, but the rest is fairly common elements, although the LEGO Bucket piece in grey isn&rsquo;t as common if I recall and it&rsquo;s nice to see it here. Other than that most of these can be found more plentiful in other sets, some of them cheaper than this if you&rsquo;re looking for parts packs.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall this isn&rsquo;t such a bad looking character, the mold is printed nicely that has captured the personality of Slimer very appropriately. He&rsquo;s definitely fun and I&rsquo;m pleased to see him here. One of them is darker than the other, but I&rsquo;ve forgotten if it is this one or the one found in the Firehouse Headquarters, so yes one will be darker than the other depending on which one you&rsquo;ve picked up.</span></span></span></span></p>

This build is extremely clever and uses a hinged brick very nicely for a moveable slime shooting device. The parts use makes it seem as if Slimer has just taken bits and pieces from an alley and slapped them together, it&rsquo;s very nicely designed and the build is quite clever and fun.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Slime Exploder: The secondary model takes all of the pieces from the first and re-arranges them into a very nice build, the use of transparent green studs makes for a suitably impressive and spooky looking model. This is definitely an example of good creative 3-in-1 building.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Slime Streamer: This is just pure disgusting fun. Fans of slime will get a kick out of building it and the appearance of a river of slime exploding out of the ground to soak everyone in ectoplasim is just fun. All three of the builds in this set have actually been quite well done and extremely enjoyable.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

These models are all so fun and quirky that I just have no idea which one is my favorite, so I&rsquo;d recommend tracking down the parts on Bricklink and building all three to have some really fun little models to play with. Why stop there, use your imagination and make even more slime spewing monstrosities that Slimer can use against the Ghostbusters.</span></span></span></span></p>

Either way, if it is true that&rsquo;s a lot of puzzles and gold bricks to track down with just these GB characters.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Slimer is one of the most versatile characters from Series 1 and has a lot of abilities that are necessary for solving puzzles. He can Fly, Dive and Sonar Smash, has Mini Access, Hazard Protection, Hazard Cleaner, Slurp Access, Boomerang and Illumination abilities. This makes Slimer a must have character, since there are a few ghost infested areas under the water that only Slimer can get past.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Slimer&rsquo;s Toy Builds also have unique and interesting abilities. The Slime Shooter has a Special Attack and can shoot Slime Bolts, this is mostly for fighting against enemies. The Slime Exploder has the Slime Beam ability, which also appears to be only good for attacking enemies. The Slime Streamer launches a Slime Bomb at enemies and can Destroy Silver LEGO Objects. Many of these may seem pointless, but considering that other vehicles and toys are more suited for solving puzzles, having something that can just attack enemies and be used as a weapon is really fun to see and a great bit of fun to use when playing in the Series 2 Battle Stages.</span></span></span></span></p>

This set also lets you own Slimer for a much cheaper price than the Firehouse Headquarters set, which makes it another great reason to get. Couple that with a great trio of fun little models to build and play with you definitely can&rsquo;t go wrong with this final offering from LEGO Dimensions Series 1. Highly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
