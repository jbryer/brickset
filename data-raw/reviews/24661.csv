<p>The minifigure&nbsp;is fantastic and is great for using for play areas, and my only real complaint is the Terror Dog is a little small for the detail, but that&#39;s really it.</p>

<p>If you can, BUY THIS SET. &nbsp;It is worth every dollar to build and play with.</p>

"8BrickMario","2017-05-17T16:01:18.247Z","Choose...or ignore?","<p>I got this pack mostly to have the minifigure, but I was looking forward to playing around as him. How did that work out?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces aren&#39;t too rate, but I think the horns and the three-toothed grey plates will be somewhat desirable.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man, the accidental choice by Ray Stantz as to which form Gozer the Destroyer should take, is a great figure. The headpiece, which incorporates the collar and hat, is well molded and captures the unnervingly blank expression of Mr. Stay Puft&nbsp;rather well, and the hat and collar are painted well. It&#39;s a shame the scale was so small that they couldn&#39;t print &quot;STAY PUFT&quot; on his hat brim. His torso is very simple, only having the knot of his sailor&#39;s collar printed on it, and his legs are plain. Sure, he&#39;s vastly undersized and nowhere near as rotund, but he&#39;s a neat little minifigure to have.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Terror Dog is rather serviceable, and while it may not be perfectly scaled or proportioned, I&#39;d be fine including it in the HQ set. Its future builds don&#39;t look quite as impressive, but I&#39;m just happy the first one can be taken out of context so easily.</p>

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve already reviewed the Ghostbusters world he can grant access to, but yeah, if you don&#39;t have Venkman or Slimer, he&#39;ll do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Abilities-wise? He&#39;s not that great. He does have the ability to grow to double size, but it&#39;s on a time limit like everyone else, and it feels slightly disappointing that someone who is known for being huge can&#39;t&nbsp;<em>stay</em>&nbsp;huge. He&#39;s immune to toxic waste, and he can break through cracked walls, but honestly, the most fun thing about him is the animations, which stretch him out to imply a gooey marshmallow texture. The Terror Dog is a good enough form of transportation, and its later forms have fire breath and flight, if you need those.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t think this pack is at all essential. But it&#39;s got a great minifigure and model for Ghostbusters fans, so if you really want them, have fun. Otherwise, it seems like a bit of a letdown...but hey, another monster is another monster, right?</p>

I love the way they made such a horrifying beast into Lego form. It is both menacing looking and cute, and was immensely satisfying to build, each step layers onto the next to complete the model perfectly. It alone is worth the price of multiple copies of this set.</span></span></span></span></p>

The model is pretty faithful to its digital counterpart though.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Terror Dog matches what we know of Zuul and his compatriot quite nicely, looking suitably menacing and quite enjoyable.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Terror Dog Destroyer is a two-headed monstrosity which looks like someone spent too much time trying to imagine a horrible alternative to the original design. It&rsquo;s spooky, menacing and impressive, but a bit mediocre as far as parts use is concerned due to taking some of the elements from the feet to make a second head. Off the toy tag he (or she) isn&rsquo;t entirely fun since it doesn&rsquo;t look nice as a separate toy.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s actually a solid model and looks great, definitely an improvement over the slightly messy looking second model.</span></span></span></span></p>

You can&rsquo;t access any of the levels though so you&rsquo;d still need Venkman and the 2016 Story Pack to unlock everything.</span></span></span></span></p>

Rebuild it into the Terror Dog Destroyer and you can now Dig and Destroy Silver LEGO Objects. The third build gives you a Special Weapon and the ability to fly, though you can&rsquo;t interact with flight docks or flight cargo hooks, but you can compete in flying races while riding an evil spectral Class 5 creature.</span></span></span></span></p>

The models and figures look better, definitely recommend it more as a toy rather than a toy to life character.</span></span></span></span></p>
