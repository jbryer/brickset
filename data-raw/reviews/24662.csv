<p>The Box and instructions are really premium - you get a great booklet full of info about the real-life buildings, with lots of photos, the build is great fun, and the finished look is awesome. Most importantly of all perhaps, it fits very neatly onto a window frame.&nbsp;&nbsp;This set truly goes into places where no&nbsp;Lego has gone before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Did I mention that the finished set looks amazing? These 3 skyline sets together are currently my favourite sets of the several hundred&nbsp;I own, they somehow manage to give a great feel for the real life places (all 3 of which Ive been to) and it&#39;s awesome that&nbsp;they&#39;re so easily displayable - they fit neatly into your life. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Great job, Lego.&nbsp;</p>

"_exile_","2018-01-25T00:53:58.057Z","Boring!","<p>I felt the need to review this one as we collect the cityscapes from the cities we&#39;ve been to. Currently, Shanghai is the only one available we haven&#39;t been to. Most of them I&#39;ve found extremely enjoyable and incredible value for money. We bought 6 of them at once and I asked my wife to choose which one she wanted to build first and she went straight for Venice. It was her favourite looking one. She loved the colours and the choice of buildings. However, as we finished it we both looked at each other and said something to the effect &quot;well that sucked&quot;. It was a major disappointment. The pieces were generic and simply uninspired from a building standpoint. We&#39;re happy we have it but it doesn&#39;t come anywhere near any of the others.</p>
