<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the usual style for Architecture - high quality and stylish. The back contains photographs of each of the real buildings depicted in the set - Berlin Wall, Reichstag, Victory Column, DB Tower, TV Tower, and the Brandenburg Gate.</p>

<p>The instructions are of the usual high quality for the theme. Sometimes these perfect bound annoy slightly because they tend not to stay open easily, but these instructions aren&#39;t too bad for this. A short background to each building is included in English and German, and there are a small number of facts included at various points during the build (its a shame there aren&#39;t more, which would prolong the build a little).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Fairly unremarkable, although the Dome &Oslash;32 in transparent brown and the&nbsp;10 Plate W. Bow 1X4X2/3 pieces&nbsp;in black were appreciated. As is custom with Architecture sets, there is a printed &#39;Berlin&#39; name&nbsp;on a 1x8 black flat tile. The pieces of the Berlin Wall are printed with some (a little bland perhaps)&nbsp;grafitti/artwork.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The base is built first, then the&nbsp;buildings are built individually from left to right, except for the mast of the TV tower which is built last. At 289 pieces the build doesn&#39;t take long, although it is enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The DB Tower and the TV tower are a little wobbly, but they do stay attached to the base. As this is a display set the wobble won&#39;t matter once the set is in place.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Each building is instantly recognisable&nbsp;to someone who has visited the city, and the detail is impressive given the small piece count. I think the dome on the Reichstag and the curvature of the DB tower (which is of course very close to the Berlin Lego Discovery&nbsp;Centre!)&nbsp;work particularly well. It would have been nice to have more of the iconic &#39;golf&nbsp;ball&#39; look of the real TV tower, but I realise that is impossible at this scale.</p>

<p>I think the size, shape and sideways facing &#39;Berlin&#39; name plate work really well for building a display of cities that a AFOL has visited.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set&nbsp;is a very good&nbsp;summary of some of Berlin&#39;s most recognisable buildings, although I think it may have limited appeal for someone who has not yet visited the city compared to some of the other Architecture sets. I think the new &#39;cityscape&#39; format is a brilliant idea and will produce some great low-cost sets of great cities.</p>

"fcoulter","2017-03-29T21:41:06.42Z","My first Lego in over a decade - was fun","<p><em>I have two daughters, and while they were growing up, we&#39;d build some Lego sets.&nbsp; Sometimes we followed the instructions, while other times it was more free-form.&nbsp; Apparently I didn&#39;t do a good enough job of being a father since neither of them are now engineers.</em></p>

<p><em>But that was a while ago, and I haven&#39;t touched Legos in a decade or so.&nbsp; So I decided to start in on them again, but less for the play factor and more for the build factor.&nbsp; That means I&#39;m looking first at the Architecture theme, and then perhaps spread out.&nbsp; But since I haven&#39;t done it in a while, I wasn&#39;t sure if I really wanted to do it so I started with a small set.&nbsp; The Berlin skyline is one of the smaller current Architecture sets, so it seemed like a good one to start with.</em></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very study, not just thin cardboard.&nbsp; Even after the set is completed, I&#39;ll probably keep the box to hold the instructions in.&nbsp; And perhaps, if my daughters decide to have children, I&#39;ll end up disassembling the set and giving it to one of my (hypothetical) grandchildren.&nbsp; The pictures on the box are a nice introduction to the set.</p>

<p>The instructions are well laid out, in perhaps too much detail.&nbsp; For example, the TV tower has alternating red and white round 1x2 pieces (614121 &amp; 614101).&nbsp; Rather than just having all of the pieces placed together in a single step, it took three steps to create the alternating pieces.&nbsp; While I understand the need to not do too much in a single step, this might have been a bit to fragmented.</p>

<p>However, I was able to build the kit without having to disassemble it and reassemble it to fix an error I made.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t have experience knowing which parts are rare or common.&nbsp; But even with my fat and stubby fingers, I was able to handle all of the pieces without difficulty.&nbsp; I do question how Lego decided which parts went in which bag; they seemed to be organized randomly.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not a minifigure, but the set comes with a very small statue for the top of the Victory Column (6138682).&nbsp; Other than that, nothing that&#39;s remotely human shaped.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very methodical.&nbsp; First you build the base, then starting with the left you build one building at a time.&nbsp; This only deviates at the very end of the process, when you hold off topping off the TV Tower until after the Brandenburg Gate is completed.&nbsp; The only reason that I can think of is that&nbsp;the TV Tower is relatively fragile, so it&#39;s possible to knock the top off while working on the Brandenburg Gate.&nbsp; By waiting until after the Brandenburg Gate is finished, you&#39;re less likely to crawl around the floor looking for the top of the TV Tower.</p>

<p>I built it over the course of a week.&nbsp; No, I&#39;m not that slow.&nbsp; But I wanted to take my time and enjoy building it.&nbsp; So I built the base on day one, added the first building on day two, etc.&nbsp; Some days were extremely short, but otherwise I&#39;d end up buying another set after just one day.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>My eldest daughter traveled to Berlin (among other places) while she was in college.&nbsp; She tells me that the buildings in the model look like the ones in Berlin.&nbsp; I&#39;m going to trust her on this since I haven&#39;t been to Berlin since I was a child.&nbsp; But there&#39;s a nice bit of variety in the look and feel of the different buildings.&nbsp; The result is a nice, variated project.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a good project for an adult beginner.&nbsp; It&#39;s not too much to handle, but the ending project doesn&#39;t look like a kid&#39;s toy.&nbsp; Recommended.</p>

<p><em>For my next project, I&#39;ll be looking&nbsp;for something bigger.&nbsp; I&#39;ll probably be building the other Skyline projects, but I&#39;ll be mixing it up a bit, too.</em></p>

"MonsterFighter","2018-01-05T14:54:00.3Z","Looks like Berlin to me!","<p>I&#39;m not going to write a long and detailed review as I think the construction and packaging&nbsp;detail has been covered in the reviews already posted, but...</p>

<p>Having visited Berlin for the first time last year, this seemed like a good set to get (thank you Santa).</p>

<p>The model captures the actual buildings well, and while I can see the disagreements about the DB tower in the reviews and comments, it is a pretty imposing structure and it certainly isn&#39;t out of place in the line up.</p>

<p>There is only one, very small, change that I&#39;ve made to my model. I&#39;ve left out the two grey technic connectors (4211483) from the TV Tower. It makes the join between the base and the tower,&nbsp;and the top structure and tower smoother and, in my eyes, more accurate. I&#39;m not sure why the connectors are there as they do not &#39;need&#39; to be included.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, having been in the dome at the Reichstag, stood next to the Victory Tower and the DB tower, had lunch in the revolving restaurant on the TV Tower,&nbsp;walked along the remains of the wall, and walked through the Brandenberg&nbsp;Gate, all I can say is well done Lego!</p>

<p>And if you&#39;re planning a visit to Berlin, do those things, it&#39;s a fantastic city!</p>

<p>Barcelona next please...</p>
