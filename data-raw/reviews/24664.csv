"Si_UKNZ","2016-08-19T13:00:17.88Z","Fits into your life","<p>These 3 skyline sets are really awesome - pretty quick to build but fantastic details and exceptionally well thought through. The previous (bigger) empire state architecture model doesnt look as good as this one. The build is pretty much as you&#39;d imagine, except 1 world trade centre which is not what you might expect! Great AFOL techniques&nbsp;for such a small relatively inexpensive set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It comes with a premium black finished photo book of the real buildings, and fits neatly into a window frame so you can actually enjoy it as part of your everyday life. What more could you want?</p>

"fcoulter","2017-04-14T19:51:36.27Z","More complexity for number two","<p><em>At the end of my <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/51580"">last review</a>, I said I&#39;d be trying something a bit bigger next time.&nbsp; What I was thinking was that I&#39;d be ordering the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21035-1/Solomon-R-Guggenheim-Museum"">Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum </a>on April 1, and that would be a substantially larger set than the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21027-1/Berlin"">Berlin skyline</a>.&nbsp; But while waiting (impatiently) for the Guggenheim to become available, Brickset.com&#39;s Amazon discount reporting robot announced that the New York skyline was available at a 25% discount.&nbsp; So I jumped at it.</em></p>

<p><em>Hey, it is bigger than Berlin, with about double the number of pieces, right?</em></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like Berlin, the box is very study, not just thin cardboard. It&#39;s also larger than the Berlin box, although the same width.&nbsp; Pity, I was hoping to put one box inside another for storage.&nbsp; The pictures on the box are a nice introduction to the set.</p>

<p>The instructions are well laid out, without having the excess detail of the Berlin kit. In the Berlin kit,&nbsp;the TV tower has alternating red and white round 1x2 pieces (614121 &amp; 614101). Rather than just having all of the pieces placed together in a single step, it took three steps to create the alternating pieces. On the other hand, the New York kit&#39;s steps were more complicated, with more bricks in each step.&nbsp; This was especially apparent in the World Trade Center, when one step included adding 32 bricks to four different bricks.&nbsp; All were duplicates, so it wasn&#39;t hard to follow.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there was one step where I missed a row of bricks.&nbsp; When it was time to stick smooth bricks to the side of the construction, I wasn&#39;t able to get the bricks to fit, so I had to partially disassemble the construction in order to fit in the additional row of bricks.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I still don&#39;t have experience knowing which parts are rare or common. But even with my fat and stubby fingers, I was able to handle all of the pieces without difficulty. I do question how Lego decided which parts went in which bag; three of them&nbsp;seemed to be organized randomly.&nbsp; The other two bags generally had related bricks, with one bag devoted only to the facing bricks for the Empire State Building.</p>

<p>I will say that the complexity of the build (as measured in time) does not appear to be a linear function of the number of pieces.&nbsp; Instead, I&#39;d say that it&#39;s exponential.&nbsp; If a 250 piece kit takes a certain amount of time, doubling the number of pieces doesn&#39;t result in double the time.&nbsp; It results in four times the time.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not a minifigure, but the set comes with a very small statue for the Statue of Liberty.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the statute isn&#39;t raising it&#39;s arm, which makes it look far less like the real Statue of Liberty.&nbsp; Other than that, nothing that&#39;s remotely human shaped.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very methodical. First you build the base, then starting with the left you build one building at a time, starting with the Statue of Liberty. What&#39;s really interesting is that the most interesting building experience, with the widest variety of ways to put something together, doesn&#39;t take place until the end of the kit.&nbsp; The World Trade Center is built in a variety of ways.&nbsp; Even parts which appear to be identical are not built the same way.</p>

<p>I built it over the course of a week or so. No, I&#39;m not that slow. But I wanted to take my time and enjoy building it. Also, life got in the way.&nbsp; So I built the base on day one, added the first building on day two, etc. Some days were extremely short, but otherwise I&#39;d end up buying another set after just one day.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I used to live in New York City.&nbsp; This model points ot all the things I didn&#39;t do while there.&nbsp; I worked south of Wall Street on Broadway.&nbsp; I saw the Statue of Liberty across the water, but I never went to visit.&nbsp; A gaming store was on the bottom of the Empire State Building, but I never went to the observation deck.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen the Chrysler Building, but it didn&#39;t seem that important.&nbsp; I must have seen the Flatiron Building, but if so it left no impression.&nbsp; I moved to Florida in 1990, so I&#39;ve never seen the new World Trade Center.</p>

<p>This model tells me two things.&nbsp; First, just because you live somewhere doesn&#39;t mean you should ignore it&#39;s features.&nbsp; See what there is to see in your town.&nbsp; Don&#39;t just be a tourist in a different city.&nbsp; And second, when I return to New York, I&#39;ve got a few things I need to see.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a nice bit of variety in the look and feel of the different buildings. The result is a nice, variated project.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a good project for an adult. It&#39;s not too much to handle, but the ending project doesn&#39;t look like a kid&#39;s toy. I&#39;m not sure it should be your first project, but it&#39;s not too difficult for a beginner.&nbsp; Recommended.</p>

<p><em>For my next project, I&#39;ll be looking for something bigger. I&#39;ve got the Guggenheim Museum sitting on my desk, and it&#39;s even bigger.&nbsp; So I know the next project.&nbsp; After that?&nbsp; We&#39;ll find out.</em></p>

"J14T14","2018-10-10T01:20:06.927Z","""My favorite thing about New York is the view, the skyline""","<p>This was my first LEGO Architecture set and I think that it did a great job at introducing me into the line. It is a great display model that was really fun and entertaining to build. The final model&nbsp;was a little smaller than I thought it would be considering the piece count, but it is still really detailed.</p>

<p>The first structure is the stature of liberty. The base of the stature is built with a good amount of detail. The olive-green pieces are really good to have and they do resemble the grass in liberty island nicley.The clear pieces also do a good job at creating a water affect. The statue herself is resembled using a nanofigure&nbsp;(you get an extra one in this set). It is not perfect, but it is the best that could be done at this scale without creating a new mold, though some print would have been welcome.</p>

<p>The next structure is the empire state building is the most detailed building in this set. It uses several techniques to build it and get the proper look. The 2x2 grill tiles are perfect for creating the texture of the outside of the building. It is the most recognizable&nbsp;building in this set and it looks perfect in this set.</p>

<p>The third structure is the chrysler building. The mixture of white and clear pieces are used to great affect and captures the look well. The top of the building is a tough look to pull off at this scale, but I think that the designer did the best&nbsp;job that could be done to the look.</p>

<p>The next structure it the flatiron building. There is not too much to be said about this. It looks great and resembles the building well. It is the smallest building and the second smallest structure in this set and it is recognizable&nbsp;to those who know their New York history.</p>

<p>The final building it the one world trade center. I was only 5 months old when 9-11 happened, but I&nbsp;still fam touched when I hear about what happened that day. That is why I love the one world trade center. it was build as a replacement and also in honor of the original world trade center buildings and it is a really beautiful&nbsp;structure. It is an odd shape to capture in LEGO form, but I think that the designer did a really great job at capturing the look of the building. I am impressed by how they were able to do it and I respect them for it. This is my favorite build in this set and it looks amazing on display.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an amazing display piece. All the structures look great and it was a really fun build. I highly recommend this set and it will be one of my favorites for a long time to come.</p>

"Fredaholic","2019-09-30T05:45:45.47Z","Superior Skyline","<p>One of the most iconic skylines internationally, the picture of New York City skyscrapers is vivid in almost all minds. The 5 landmarks and architectural&nbsp;wonders chosen to bound beauty on this set have done no wrong. The Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Chrysler Building, Flatiron Building, and One-World Trade Center leave no empty space here.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>The set overall is, well, pure genius. Not only does it&nbsp;make great use of small techniques, but the set also captures the image engraved in the minds; the one of NYC. I feel with no doubt it is one of the best architecture sets out there.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building and Finished Product:</strong></p>

<p>Beginning at the base, the set quickly develops. Before I knew it, Lady Liberty was good as new! Speaking of her, she&#39;s surrounded by 1x2 clear smooth tiles, and her dwarf appearance makes her seem intimidated by the massive monstrosities at her side (which I have to admit is one of the sad downfalls of this set). One of which is the Empire State Building, which, like it&#39;s 2019 counterpart, is dazzled in 1x2 modified grill pieces. This shrunken version is perfect, and its finish is probably one of the best in the set. Beside it is the art-deco Chrysler Building, built of pure 2x2 and 1x2 tiles. One note; the building&#39;s box representations show a light-white color to the building, while the finished product is pure white (I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s just me). The dwarfed Flatiron Building near it is neatly done, keeping its triangular shape. Finally, the grand finish of the one world trade center is beautiful, perfectly depicting the building in real life and making the best use of techniques in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money:</strong></p>

<p>The New York City skyline is $60 (or more specifically $59.99) in the U.S. for 598 pieces. And, as statistics show above, the Price Per Part is 10 cents. It&#39;s not bad, but for comparison, the 649 pieces set 21044 Paris shows 7.7 cents a piece retailing for $50. I have no real perspective on this, especially as being a KFOL, but I still believe it&#39;s really alright.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>A great set, 100% recommend with beautiful detail and accuracy. Looks great on a shelf and in person. Have a ball with this beauty!&nbsp;</p>

<p>From a bad standpoint&nbsp;I think the Statue of Liberty can be done better here.</p>
