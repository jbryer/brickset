But the more I looked at my old <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21008-1/Burj-Khalifa"">21008</a>, the less I liked it, particularly next to some of the more modern Architecture sets. So I bit the bullet and picked this one up, and I&#39;m glad I did.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s an architecture set, which means a few packages of parts and a square bound manual in a handsome box. As always, great information about the building.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I like the assortment this time around, compared to 21008 which was all barrels.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Much more varied than 21008, thanks to the combination of the central structure and cladding.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Seriously imposing, for an Architecture set. Taller than the Eiffel Tower, it now dominates a lineup of Architecture models rather than fading into the background. There are some drawbacks with the representation compared to 21008, but the overall model&nbsp;<em>looks</em>&nbsp;so much better that I&#39;m willing to forgive.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Fun build and a worthy replacement for 21008. Now I just have to decide what I&#39;m going to do with all those barrels&hellip;</p>
