<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So we begin the 2016 Bionicle season with a review of one of the most radically designed sets. I had a system of reviewing the sets in the previous year which tended to focus on body parts and their designs, which clearly will not work for reviews on the creatures. Instead, I will be shortening the list of categories with which I will make my critique of the creature sets. The Toa will only have the Unity feature added.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Categories for the Creatures are as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>The head design</li>
	<li>Builds&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Colours</li>
	<li>Playability</li>
	<li>Unity Models</li>
	<li>Overall Design and Concepts</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With that out of the way, we begin with the head design of our fellow little Ketar. Perhaps one of the strangest things about Ketar is the fact that his head looks nothing alike to being that of a scorpion, but rather takes on a wolf-like&hellip;or avian-like nature. That said, I understand that LEGO was going for a unique creation which could relate similarly to the others (much like the Protectors and their masks). Still, I love the runes decorating the head of the creature, they give it an even more special, mystical look. The eyes are present, even though they are small and difficult to notice. However, since these sets are all about the Unity function, I can understand why the eyes are in no way particularly decorated, as it might clash with the look of the Toa with their creatures united. The hollowness of the head is also due to the fact that the Toa masks are supposed to fit underneath, forming a crown or helmet, which I must say looks very regal on all the Toa. The creature head is melded with a beautiful transparent neon green colour, which has come to be a great secondary colour for the Stone characters. It&rsquo;s not the best creature head design, but I will take it for what it is. 7/10</p>

<p>The build for Ketar is very interesting. He and Akida are probably the most differently built of the creatures, and I do like that you get variety with these little guys. I enjoyed the overall build, however do recommend perhaps straying away from the instructions when it comes to putting on his crystal claw blades, just to avoid the possibility of damaging the plastic pieces. The build is much more interesting than many of the other small sets that we&rsquo;ve gotten so far, but it is heavily technic based. Still, I can&rsquo;t help but like it. 8/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The colours on Ketar are definitely a bit strange. We have different shades of brown, transparent neon green, black, grey pieces all over this set. I do feel that some of the colours clash, but I again understand that the concept for this creature is supposed to look messy, that of a desert theme or wastelander theme as we saw with Nilkuu and Pohatu last year. I&rsquo;m not particularly bothered by Ketar&rsquo;s colours, but do hope to possibly see something more coherent in the future. 7.5/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ketar has a very fun little function, which is activated by pushing his tail left or right. Doing this causes the blades or his claws to come up or down, depending on how well you managed to synchronize them during the building phase. I have to say, I like the function, but do wish that there had been more friction added. The function is much too loose and it thus becomes frustrating to try and pose him, never mind posing him when he&rsquo;s united to Pohatu. Luckily, his claws can be locked using a three-hole flat technic piece {also found on Vizuna&rsquo;s bow}), but it does not completely erase the looseness feel of the creature, as I will mention in a bit. &nbsp;Ketar&rsquo;s legs are very poseable, but his tail, unfortunately, is quite limited thanks to the dark tan vorox piece being used to hold the tail in place on his back. Ketar&rsquo;s head is also restricted by the gears used for his claw function, which is a bit of a shame. All in all, Ketar can be fun to play around with, but might frustrate you at times. 7/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unity mode featured for Ketar and Pohatu is very odd. It&rsquo;s perhaps the most crazy combination I&rsquo;ve seen thus far, but despite this, it kind of works! I have to say that Ketar fits well on Pohatu&rsquo;s back and does give the character the added tail as a weapon (even though it&rsquo;s a little restricted) and the crystal claws as extra weapons on Pohatu&rsquo;s shoulders. The function works very well in the unity mode and really doesn&rsquo;t kill the aesthetic of the two sets, even though it is an odd combination. Beware, however, of posing these two together, as Ketar adds quite a bit of weight to Pohatu making him back-heavy. Additionally, you can lock Ketar&rsquo;s claws to allow for more posing, while moving his legs around Pohatu&rsquo;s torso to give the character a more fierce, armoured look. The only gripe I have with the two united is Ketar&rsquo;s floppiness. Because of the construction of his torso, the unity piece is loose and it is tasking to be able to align Ketar&rsquo;s head perfectly with Pohatu&rsquo;s mask. It will look odd, there is no way to stop it. Still, it&rsquo;s crazy and weird&hellip;and still gives me that Mad Max vibe. 7.5/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think the set was decently designed. I still think that the tails are a work in progress for LEGO, and think the crystal claws were a bit of a silly addition considering claws could have worked very well. I feel that this probably would have taken Ketar&rsquo;s gear function away completely and that LEGO did not want that to happen, as it would make Ketar the only creature set with no playable function. I don&rsquo;t think Ketar is a bad set, but I also don&rsquo;t think he needs to be bought with Pohatu in order for you to have fun with it. I think the two complement each other well, however, when they are put together, so I would suggest picking both up if you can do so. Is Ketar my first choice of creature? No. But I do not think he is a Skull Scorpio level of awkward and you might end up having fun with him, especially if you love the old Rahi aesthetic. 37/50</p>
