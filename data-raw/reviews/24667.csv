"SanMams91","2016-01-15T03:28:16.563Z","Akida, hopefully a trend that continues for Water sets","<p>As with my review of Ketar, we begin with the most basic part of the creature, its head. Akida, being one of the &lsquo;smaller Toa&rsquo; companions, has her head be silver, but melded with two blue colours, that of light transparent blue and dark transparent blue. I think this is lovely, especially once you&rsquo;ve put its orange horn on the nose tip of the head and you get a beautiful consistency of the colours. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s as hollow as the other creature heads and does feature the same runes, which is pretty cool! 7/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build of Akida is my favourite so far of the reboot series. Call it what you will, I cannot explain it, but it must be my old Bionicle self that really loves this build. Akida is completely technic-based, using little to really no CCBS pieces. I though her build despite this was excellent. I mentioned how much I enjoyed Ketar&rsquo;s build, but it really paled in comparison to Akida&rsquo;s build. I just love all the random intricacies of the construction, as well as all the light blue pieces used. It also took a bit of time for me to build Akida. Great build. 9/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This will be a bit of a spoiler alert, but I love the colours on the water sets for this year. Something in my mind just clicked and said &lsquo;finally!!&rsquo; when I saw Gali and Akida clad in, not just transparent dark blue, but the sorely missing orange, which I have not seen on a Bionicle set (at least to my knowledge) since the hints of orange on the Gahlok bohrok creatures in 2002. This is refreshing and much needed for the water characters, as I always felt there was something missing about them and I have to say, orange is a fantastic colour to give Akida with all those blue parts. Combined with Gali, the two sets radiate watery, weird glory, and I love it. This is one of the most coherent colour schemes for this wave, at least in my view. 10/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Akida had to take a hit somewhere, and I have to say that playability is where the set fails. As a model, Akida is fantastic. As a toy, Akida has turbo shoulder stud shooter torpedoes, which are nice&hellip;.but won&rsquo;t really do much else for you. The tail can move around, as can the fins, and you can get some dramatic poses out of the dorsal fin function, solely there for the unity mode. Akida at least comes with a shadow trap, which I&rsquo;ve grown to like a bit. The mouth opens and closes perfectly and I do like spinning its propeller. Otherwise, don&rsquo;t expect to be playing much with this one. 6/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve already spoiled it, but Gali and Akida together are incredibly, surprisingly glorious. The orange and blues are beautiful together and you can definitely have some fun playing around with these two in their unity mode, whether it&rsquo;s by preparing Gali&rsquo;s shoulder turrets for attack (dorsal fin function) or setting them downwards to get some thoughtful posing or action from our female hero. Of course, there are also the shoulder turrets, which can fire at the ready with just a little bit of adjustment. I will discuss a little more about Gali&rsquo;s part to play in her unity mode, but I had to say how much I love their unity mode. 9/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly, Akida is a great little set. LEGO also was gracious enough to provide a stand for Akida so that it can be posed in a swimming position, which I think is wonderful. If anything, this seems to prove to me more than anything that Akida is more of a model than a toy and might be designed to appeal to..possibly older Bionicle fans with its build and lack of real play function. Combined with Gali, I find the two to be great together. By itself, I still think Akida&rsquo;s worth picking up for the fantastic build and also if you&rsquo;re a fan of aquariums or aquatic animals. I&rsquo;m surprisingly impressed by this set and am really looking forward to seeing what LEGO has in store for future water sets. 41/50</p>

"ThoughtLash","2016-06-03T22:06:27.047Z","Cool Fish-Thing","<p>Akida is my second creature, after Ketar.&nbsp; While I think I prefer the scorpion, Akida is a very cool set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The basic small 2015/16 box, which I&#39;ve gone over in other reviews.&nbsp; The front has a picture of Akida and info, while the back has the usual warnings and comic.</p>

<p>The instructions are also similar to sets of the same size, I found no misprints, and they included the same comic on the back of the package.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Only four normal CCBS pieces are included, two short trans-blue limb pieces, and one extra-long&nbsp;type in black.&nbsp; The former are used for the head and tail, while the latter is used as the torso. A beast head is used in silver, with both light and dark trans-blue blended into the back. This piece is quite detailed, has a CCBS socket on the bottom, and a small hole on the front for horns or other details.</p>

<p>Five light azure fins are used as, well, fins.&nbsp; Two trans-blue stud-shooters are used, along with other pieces that resemble the above without the features.&nbsp; On the torso, two Technic pieces are used in the same blue.</p>

<p>Several orange pieces are included, three cones, two spikes that have been used for years in BIONICLE, a horn, the same as used in Skull Basher and countless other sets, and two ornate&nbsp;blades.&nbsp; I especially like the blades,&nbsp;a shame it only came with two.</p>

<p>Various other Technic and CCBS are used, mainly connectors and rods of different sorts. Three pairs of ratchet joints are used to mount the stud shooters, which are connected to propellers on each.</p>

<p>The Shadow Trap is built with the special pieces, both in gunmetal, Exo-Force robot arms in blue, four spindly limbs, and various other small parts. A stand is also included for Akida, consisting of a Technic axle, a System cylinder, and a large dish.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for the little fish is actually surprisingly complex, built around an extra-long CCBS limb.&nbsp; A mechanism is built into the back, which, when the fin is raised, causes the stud shooters to fold up.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Quite a nice set.&nbsp; Akida features six points of articulation, plus the adjustable weapons.&nbsp; It mounts a pair of stud shooters, which fire when the propellers on the back are twisted.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t tested Unity mode yet.</p>

<p>The Shadow Trap is one of my least favorite designs, as the legs seem to long and not very machine-like.&nbsp; I do, however, like the propeller on the back.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Akida is definitely a cool set, one of the best creatures of 2016.&nbsp; It looks great, the orange complements the blue very well, although there could be more silver, and the single blue beam clashes somewhat.&nbsp; The function, while cool, isn&#39;t that effective, and the propellers clash with the otherwise organic look.&nbsp; Akida is a good set, I&#39;d get it again.</p>
