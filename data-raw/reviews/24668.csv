<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is nice, giving you a very good idea of what you are getting and even giving you a hint at what&#39;s in back. The instructions are pretty easy to follow and there are no pages where there are angle issues with specific parts being shown going into certain places.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a nice selection of parts with the trans neon orange claws, the large flames, large wings and orange sword pieces. The only thing I wish this set had was a lower jaw for the head so that the figure is a little more playable without it&#39;s larger counterpart to attach to.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t too difficult to complete. The only problems that other people would have is with the axles and inserting them into the gold chest piece and the black central body. Trying to thread the axle into 3 slots is slightly difficult if they are not aligned properly.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I kind of liked this model over all. the down sides were the hollow head and the tail having to lift up in order for the wings to flap. I&#39;m not sure the ball joint for the wings was needed because the joint at the flames is flexible as well. I still gave it a 4 rating because I did like the part selection.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2016-03-22T22:08:33.5Z","A Fun little Bird!","<p>After the hype over Bionicle&#39;s return in 2015; I will say that I was honestly let down by most of what 2016 is offering, particularly the childish story that was told in <i>Bionicle: Journey to One</i>&nbsp;on Netflix. However, setwise&nbsp;the creatures from the winter wave stood out instantly to me. They captured the vibes of the Rahi and Bohrok of the Bionicle of my youth, and seemed to offer interesting builds. Ikir is to date my only creature I have bought, so lets see how he stacks up.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is a hexagonal package similar to last years sets, but with a thicker cardboard material. Instructions are clear and consise.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Oh so many good parts here for constraction fans, yet a few parts that should stand out to the Technic builder. Of note is the gear with an axle on one end, which can rotate freely using a pin connection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Bionicle builds tend to be more simple than the normal Lego builds, yet for only $10 USD Ikir offers a surprisingly fun build. The construction of the wing mechanism is somewhat challenging, and rewarding.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The lack of any standard CCBS shells means Ikir doesn&#39;t look like the CCBS figures we have been offered over the last few years; and more like a Bionicle set from 2002 or 2003. This isn&#39;t particularly a bad thing, although it stands out in the presence of the smoother sets from 2015. The flapping wings are fun, and the ability to adjust the creature&#39;s neck and talons are insanely entertaining. Ikir can get into many bird like poses, and it is somewhat comical to pose it as though it was a bird cleaning its feathers, or pecking at food on the ground. The shadow trap included in the set is fun, but rather bland compared to the traps in the other sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While my dissatisfaction with&nbsp;<em>Journey to One</em>&nbsp;and many of the set choices made this year remain; Ikir has convinced me that the creatures are among Bionicle&#39;s most ingenious sets. If you are looking for a small set that won&#39;t break your wallet; or one that would be great for a small present to a child, Ikir is easy to recommend.&nbsp;</p>
