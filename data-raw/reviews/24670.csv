"DarterTheVanquisher","2016-02-02T19:44:24.183Z","Cannot Fly!","<p>This set I picked up at the LEGO store along with a bunch of others. He is pretty cool and I thought that he would be better then his other set, read on to find out if That is true...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same as the other types of boxes I like the foil bags better. These new boxes are made from thicker cardboard which is better. The new design on top is really cool and looks better then the older one with the Mask of Control featured the instructions are basic and have some ads and comics.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set you get new swords, new torso, new armor, add ons, and new chestplate.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took awhile with all the Technic that is in the center. I do not like the fact that you need custom shoulder mounts and all the Technic that fills his torso.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As the title states this form of Lewa cannot fly, well you all might say but actually Mask Maker, If you get Uxar. Well that costs a lot more money, while last year the basic price and boom nice flashy wings. And these sets do not come with a small little creature to fight. I wish that all sets came with shadow traps but oh well. So after that complaining I will say this: The weapons work well and are cooler then last years axes however as siad before the axes also were wings so yeah. The unite feature is cool but makes it so you cannot have a nice gearbox on the back so now you get a small gear on the back of the hip piece, and well the function is harder to use and not as cool. the best weapons for each type of gear system is as follows. short swords or one handed weapons work best with the older gearbox while two handed or large weapons like Gali&#39;s old trident thing work best with the turntable torso. The wings that Uxar grant him are cool and larger and make more sense that he could fly but I still like the older ones better.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is not as good in terms of value as any of the other older sets from last year as they do not have any of the features like the transport mode and a small villian to fight it would be really cool to see more shadow traps as they are really fun. This set is cool and is cooler then Tahu, if you want just a couple of the new sets get this and Tahu plus there creatures. If you want only one set in the line get Umarak as he is the best of the line.</p>

"Dragon_Master_48","2019-08-26T00:17:21.787Z","An Excellent Addition to a Theme Gone Too Soon","<p><strong>71305 Lewa - Uniter of Jungle</strong> is one of the &quot;Uniter&quot; versions of the Toa and the second version of Lewa in the BIONICLE Reboot theme. The Uniters switch things up; instead of having a gearbox enabling arm motion, they have a simple gear mechanism at their hip which allows you to swing their upper half from side to side. While this may seem like a downgrade to some, instead of having both forms of motion on one figure, the freed-up space allows for the signature uniting mechanic, that allows each Toa to combine with their respective Elemental Creature (and maybe they can combine with other creatures as well; I&#39;m not able to test it out for myself).</p>

<p>The build is pretty standard for the Reboot style of constraction figures, although Lewa switches it up a little bit by having his limbs, especially the legs, be a bit of a nonstandard design, which does, unfortunately, restrict articulation in certain instances. Despite this, the figure is very posable. I particularly love the weapons. The parts, likewise, are mostly standard for what you&#39;d expect in a constraction set, but if you&#39;re getting this set simply for parts, the colors are probably what you&#39;re looking for the most. The crystalline shoulder pieces in silver and trans green look great, as do the similarly-blended weapon blades. Lewa&#39;s mask look fantastic, even better than his old one, and the new eye piece in blue is a great addition. Although, somewhat surprisingly, this set has fewer pieces than its Elemental Creature companion, the pieces in this set are larger</p>

<p>Speaking of the combining feature, when combined with 71300 Uxar - Creature of Jungle, Lewa looks very awesome in his new form. Lewa with wings is simply amazing, and allows this Toa of Air... excuse me, Jungle, to take flight.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Lewa is back and better than before.</li>
	<li>Hip movement allows for more construction possibilities.</li>
	<li>Works well with Uxar and gives you a reason to buy both sets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Limb articulation can be a little weird due to unique design.</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;m honestly sad that the BIONICLE Reboot theme didn&#39;t last so that we could get more awesome designs like this! Maybe branch out with all new Toa instead of the original six.</p>
