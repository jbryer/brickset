<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first Toa of 2016 that I will review here is Pohatu. Since he was my first Toa last year, I feel that he should be one of the first ones reviewed here. For the Toa, I will critique them using some different methods, which are as follows:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Mask</li>
	<li>Build</li>
	<li>Weapon</li>
	<li>Arms</li>
	<li>Legs</li>
	<li>Torso</li>
	<li>Playability</li>
	<li>Unity Mode</li>
	<li>Overall Design and Concept</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firstly, his mask is probably my favourite of the Toa this time around. I love that it&rsquo;s the same mask as last year, but rounder. I like the crystal motif on his head and I very much like the design of the eyes on him. It makes him look a little alien, but I think that&rsquo;s a strength of this mask design. The vents are still there, but they&rsquo;ve been minimized from the big vents jutting out of the sides of his face last year. The mask is quite small, but I can&rsquo;t help but love it. The Nuva symbols are there, as are a few cool looking runes. I especially love his transparent neon green melded golden mask&hellip;which looks absolutely beautiful. It really helps make his eyes a very bluish green when placed on the figure. Probably my favourite stone mask ever created. 9/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>His build is surprisingly fun. I originally thought I would be irritated by the way his arms are built, but to my relief discovered that it&rsquo;s actually a neat little design. Of course, the build is one of the more simple ones of the Toa this year, but I think he definitely is much more complex than the version of him we saw last year. Other than his arms, there is the torso with the swivelling function, mind you mine squeaks very much, and the friction is very strong. I also enjoyed the building of his flail/spear. Otherwise, pretty general like last year. 8/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>His weapon is very odd. I like the idea of a rock flail very much, in fact I would go as far as to hope that he gets a mace for a weapon come 2017, but I digress. I find it odd that they chose to combine the flail with a spear weapon, solely for the sake of the function. I do not feel that this was necessary, as you can easily leave a couple of the pieces used for his weapon, giving him just the flail which works just as well as it should. Otherwise, the weapon tends to not work well with his function, and that is not at all surprising. The chain flops somewhat forward when you swing him to one side, but it immediately comes back, likely due to the weight of the rock, to hit his knee. I like the creativity of the weapon and hope LEGO continues on this road for this character. Overall, I do not feel that this is one of the best weapons this time around unfortunately. 7.5/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>His arms, as I mentioned earlier, are very oddly constructed. Now, I originally thought I would dislike them very much, but having the set in hand, I find that they look quite good on him! I especially like the transparent neon green shells acting as bracers on his arms. I don&rsquo;t mind the skinny look of the dark orange parts either. What is additionally even more impressive is how poseable his shoulders are, making his arms that much more moveable. The shoulder armour (definitely a plus over last year) is well placed and I like the accents of the bohrok eyes to the sides. Overall, decent looking arms. I do however prefer the generally more bulky look of the arms. 8/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>His legs now have an even more pronounced boot look, which I very much like. I liked it on Pohatu last year, I greatly like it this year. I especially love the neon green crystal armour pieces, which look great on all the Toa this year as it gives Pohatu a more rugged look. Poseability of the legs is fantastic, but I am not sure how I feel about the colour change of the upper leg shells. Dark tan&hellip;&hellip;I have placed the two Pohatus together, and this is definitely subjective, but I find I like the dark orange much more than the dark tan. I don&rsquo;t know why, I just don&rsquo;t like it as much as I did the dark orange. Otherwise, well designed legs. 9/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The torso is pretty simply built and there&rsquo;s not much to really discuss here other than three things: colour, chest design, and proportions. I&rsquo;ll begin with proportions, since I don&rsquo;t mind it as much. What I&rsquo;ve noticed on a couple of these sets is that the shoulder joints are now located much higher than they were last year, which will definitely make the Toa&rsquo;s arms look comically short. Lewa is probably the worst offender in that sense, but seeing as I do not own him, I will refrain from saying much else about him. It doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all on Pohatu, but I felt it should be mentioned if you are someone who prefers a more realistic anatomical look to the sets. I already mentioned this before, but the switch to dark tan is a bit strange. I actually do not like this colour as much as I liked the dark orange last year and really hope LEGO goes back to it. I appreciate the creativity of the colour, but personally, I don&rsquo;t think it fits Pohatu well. Lastly, his chest design is also the result of experimentation and creativity, but, again, it doesn&rsquo;t fit well for me. I think the desert camo look is interesting, and I definitely love the Stone nuva symbols printed onto the centre and sides. Out of all the Toa, I feel that Pohatu&rsquo;s is my least favourite, but that does not mean I dislike it, it just means I like the other prints a little bit more. Overall, decent looking chest, I just wish there was more dark orange. 7.5/10</p>

<p>Pohatu is loads of fun. You can split his weapon apart to form an actual flail and a spear/dagger thing, kind of like what he had last year, and you can even connect the spear to his back using the unity connections which I think is an accidental but awesome feature. The winging function really is fun, but it definitely does vary in terms of strength of friction (my Kopaka is very loose, for example). His arms are very poseable, as are his legs. I still do not like the fact that these Toa use more friction extenders, but I understand why they&rsquo;re there. Combining Pohatu with Ketar brings additional play value, as you can use Ketar&rsquo;s claws on Pohatu when they are both combined. As I mentioned in my review of Ketar, however, their unity mode is a bit flimsy and will take some getting used to. All in all though, I think Pohatu is pretty fun with and without Ketar. 8.5/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I don&rsquo;t think this Pohatu quite measures up to Master Pohatu from last year. I think this has to do with the colours, with the interesting weapon design from last year, and likely the fact that Master Pohatu was my first Toa purchased last year. I think that if you&rsquo;re a huge fan of Pohatu, you should get this set. If you want to get a really stable, good-looking unity mode and don&rsquo;t care about which Toa you want to get, I would highly recommend looking at the other Toa rather than Pohatu/Ketar. The other unities just seem to look better than this one does, although, if you play around with the unity mode here, you can definitely make these two look excellent together. If you&rsquo;re in it just to buy a Toa and don&rsquo;t care about the unity mode, or perhaps you dislike the creatures and are on a tight budget, then Pohatu is absolutely a great choice, as he looks great without Ketar and is one of two Toa in this wave that can look fine without their creatures in my opinion. I think Pohatu&rsquo;s a decent set and I like some of the ideas used in his design by LEGO, but I just feel they&rsquo;re not quite there yet with this character. It definitely makes me excited for his 2017 version! 57.5/80</p>
