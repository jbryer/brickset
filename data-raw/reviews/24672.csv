"FordianL","2016-01-08T21:21:26.27Z","So Disappointing, You Will Be Blue","<p>The 2016 winter wave Bionicle sets are upon us, including new versions of the Toa from yesteryear. Among them is Gali, the Toa of Water, who has been my favorite Toa of the original six ever since she premiered in 2001. With new looks and gimmicks abound, I was excited for this set, but through pictures and having it in hand I was ultimately disappointed.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is the same hexagonal shape it was last year with the Mask of Control and green glyph designs on the top. The cardboard is sturdier than last year, and while many were worried about the cardboard quality, I am more concerned about set quality.</p>

<p>The instructions are straightforward and very easy to follow. Nothing truly noteworthy here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set features many new parts and recolors, including&nbsp;recognizable parts released in 2009 in orange. New torso frame, torso shell, waist piece, masks, crystal&nbsp;blade and armor, and the &quot;piece of unification&quot; are included here, as well as dark azure and translucent blue 4M shells.</p>

<p>The masks are blended: silver and dark azure for one, gold and translucent blue for the other. Each mask features Gali&#39;s&nbsp;Nuva symbol, a callback to 2002 if you wanted or needed one. Speaking of the Nuva symbol, it is also printed on her chest, which is &quot;fused&quot; to the rest of her torso shell. The silver torso shell itself features 23 very distinct piston sculpts, as well as printing in dark azure, orange, and silver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My main gripe (and many others as well)&nbsp;with the Toa for this wave is the new torso shell. It&#39;s eye-catching in all the wrong ways to me, being more of a detractor than a stimulator to pick up the set from the shelf. The design is cluttered, and being just a single <em>printed&nbsp;</em>piece it is near useless for custom creations, as the design is specific for the character. I didn&#39;t mind the chest prints from 2015 at all; in fact, I liked them a lot. They had character and were reusable in numerous circumstances. This year&#39;s torso shell, however, is not. I would have liked it more if the pistons&nbsp;actually <em>did</em> something, such as make the upper half of the torso swivel, much like a traditional action figure. Sadly, it is only there for looks and pleasing those who want something to look complex just for the sake of looking complex.</p>

<p>The only piece I really love in this set (besides all of the dark azure shells) is the crystal blade. I love how the two colors work together to make a cohesive and wholesome blade; you can tell that the weapon is powerful but also slightly weathered looking, giving it age from past battles.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build of this figure does not take very long. I felt like I spent longer assembling Bionicle sets from 2015, and being an undying fan of Lego since the year 2000, that&#39;s not saying much. For those who want more pins and axles in your Bionicle sets, I guess this is the decent thing for you. If you&#39;re looking for a full CCBS&nbsp;build, I suggest you look into the Star Wars buildable figures or any of the 2015 Bionicle sets, as they have a more satisfying buildup than this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Gali has gained a significant boost in height since 2015, mostly from the elongated torso. For those who care about proportions (such as myself), you may not like this set. The torso is too long, the arms are so short that they almost seem stubby, and the legs are rather odd when it comes to limb placement. Overall, this set would be my anatomy professor&#39;s worst nightmare.</p>

<p>The color scheme works surprisingly well, and is a welcoming change from the dark azure with yellow from 2015. I would have preferred yellow over orange, but I like it&#39;s placement here. The translucent colors also blend in well with the solid colors, making for a cohesive color scheme.</p>

<p>Speaking of cohesiveness, this set fails in that category. An overly greebled&nbsp;chest piece and relatively straightforward limbs do not a good look make, and this set exemplifies that. As I said before, it looks too fan&nbsp;boy pleasing to me, and I would much rather have had a torso&nbsp;plate with no pistons and stickers, as well as existing as two separate pieces for use on custom creations.</p>

<p>The eyes do not light pipe all that well, either. The eyestalk is light blue, which only really pops when put directly in front of a light source. This barely shows up when put in front a light source due to both the shaping of the mask and the new mold used for the eyestalk. The light piping doesn&#39;t even work with the partially translucent mask, either, rendering the light piping as a whole as useless.</p>

<p>Most of the sets in this wave feature a waist swivel function. The function works quite well, and is fun, but on my copy of the set the friction in the turntable was so great that the torso barely moves, and makes the most dreadful squeaking noise. I have considered oiling the mechanism to stop the sound, but I cannot separate the waist piece and torso frame from each other to do so. Therefore, the waist swivel gimmick has become a <em>waste</em> of time, thus decreasing the play value of this set.</p>

<p>The unification gimmick is present on all of the Toa and Umarak the Hunter, and while I do not yet have Gali&#39;s respective creature, I can say that from pictures the united form looks much better than the standalone set. Therein lies the problem; the only real way to make this set look good is to pay more money to get another set. I shouldn&#39;t have to do that, but at least it is still an option for me in the future.</p>

<p>Gali&nbsp;just seems very basic when compared to the other Toa of the wave. She offers nothing interesting or really anything unique besides the color scheme, mask, and weapon. She lost much of the character she had in her 2015 form which I enjoyed, and that is just what ruins this figure for me.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As I stated before, I have been a longtime fan of Gali as a character, and this set is missing just that: character. It is bland and offers nothing revolutionary, and its only saving grace comes in the form of a few armor shells and a blade. If you like this set, I&#39;m glad you do, but I found no redeeming qualities after the few parts in select colors that it offers. If you are like me and do not like this set, I suggest you look into purchasing a different Bionicle set or one of the Star Wars buildable figures.</p>

"SanMams91","2016-01-15T04:03:41.35Z","Gali!","<p>As with Pohatu, I begin this review by looking at Gali&rsquo;s masks. She comes with one dark azure mask melded with silver, while her golden mask is melded with that awesome transparent dark blue colour which I adore a whole lot. As for the masks themselves, I love them. I love that the goggle look is still present on Gali, I love her nuva symbol (might be my favourite one in terms of design) up at the top of her forehead, and especially like the little runes and decorations she has along with the symbol. The two beside it actually resemble the number 9 if you look closely, with one being backwards. I just think that&rsquo;s neat. I like that she has more of a scuba diver look and honestly am not bothered too much by the crystalline design that gives her a &lsquo;hair&rsquo; type look. One thing I will say about her mask, which I don&rsquo;t think is as much an issue of the mask as it is of the eye stalk colour chosen, is that the light-piping is the worst of the figures this time around. You really have to hold her up to some kind of light to see the eyes glow in any way. The golden mask makes up for it by reflected light off of the eyes to get an even darker bluish hue, which I do appreciate. Great mask all in all! 8.5/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gali&rsquo;s build is almost exactly the same as Pohatu&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s not particularly complex, but it does take a little longer to build her, compared to her 2015 iteration. There is a deviation from Pohatu&rsquo;s build in that one of her shoulders just has an extra tube piece placed so that you can insert the orange vorox armour piece onto it. Pretty general but still fun build. 8/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her weapon absolutely has to be one of my favourite of this wave. I actually originally hated this weapon&hellip;I thought it was nowhere near as good as her axe/trident weapon was. In fact, I thought the spinner was bizarre and did not understand why it was even there in the first place. Well, once this spear weapon is built, my mind completely changed. I love it. I like that it&rsquo;s a light weapon, but that she has almost a triple function with it. She can use the spinner, use the chain on the end of the spear as another form of defence, and then use the blade tip as the main weapon function. I think it&rsquo;s extremely cool that she also has a hilt built onto this spear. Honestly, if you put this thing together, you really do see how nice it is. At least I definitely did. This has to be my second favourite weapon of the wave, much to my delighted surprise. 9/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now onto Gali&rsquo;s arms. There&rsquo;s really not much to say about the arms. She uses the same arm construction as Gali &rsquo;15, except that, like Pohatu, her shoulders are now much higher up, which then gives her the short-arm syndrome that most of the other Toa suffer from in this series. Honestly, it does not bother me as much as it does on Lewa. It might just be because of the bulked up CCBS pieces she has (dark azure and transparent dark blue)! The poseability is a little limited, however, which is definitely something some people will not like. The arms are overall decent. 8/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her legs are, once again, hampered by the friction extenders. Again, I know why they&rsquo;re there&hellip;I just don&rsquo;t like them. Otherwise, Gali&rsquo;s legs are actually shorter than last year, as the transparent blue bone piece is now much shorter to accommodate for the additions of the friction extenders. Otherwise, I love the asymmetrical design and that crystal armour piece that is silver and light transparent blue&hellip;.oh it is great. I originally though I would hate the gaps in her leg with the orange vorox armour being just randomly placed there&hellip;but I actually really like it. I think it&rsquo;s because the bone piece is black and not grey&hellip;that could be it. I like that they went for something interesting with Gali in any case. 8.5/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gali&rsquo;s torso is definitely one of her greatest highlights. The chest design features beautiful patterns of orange on a blue background, with her nuva symbol in the centre. Then there&rsquo;s the added connection for the right vorox pad shoulder, which creates an excellent shoulder pad effect. It&rsquo;s also somewhat moveable, but limits the movement of her right arm. Otherwise, I really like that there&rsquo;s a system grill piece on her back and, as well, I love that there are black axles included for this set. Her colours are one of the biggest highlights this time around, and I appreciate how excellent she looks. Unlike Lewa, Gali&rsquo;s use of the silver is not over done, not in the slightest. This is mostly due to the fact that she has many other colours complementing the silver, so it doesn&rsquo;t feel like she&rsquo;s been bathing in silver at all. Her chest design is definitely one of my favourites of the wave. 9/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability on Gali is limited, and I feel that this is for the same reason as it was on Akida. Simply put, Gali seems to be more of a model than a play thing. Despite this, she still has free movement in the legs, head, left arm, but does have a bit of her right arm restricted by the shoulder design on there. I still think that she&rsquo;s super fun and that her waist gimmick works better on her than it does on Pohatu, since her weapon does not have a giant&hellip;thing on the end of it whacking the figure in the knees. However, once you unite her with Akida, you get the added playability of the shoulder turrets, which do need to be adjusted so that you&rsquo;re not firing studs and hitting her shoulders at the same time. I said it in Akida&rsquo;s review and I&rsquo;ll say it again, I love this unity mode the most. The added orange I think actually allows for Gali&rsquo;s golden mask to work much more with Akida&rsquo;s silver head&hellip;it definitely looks awesome. Also, Gali looks incredible with Ikir! 8/10</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think that these two, together, are my favourite combination of sets of G2. I did not expect to love them as I have come to&hellip;but honestly, it&rsquo;s a feeling, and it&rsquo;s strong for Gali and Akida. I do think a lot of people will not like them because they have their limits in play and do have a few interesting design choices. But they might work for you. I would highly recommend getting them both together, as you will have tons of fun building both of them if you&rsquo;re more of an old-school fan like I am. Anyway, awesome, awesome, awesome water sets, from a generally &lsquo;air&rsquo; or jungle character fan. You&rsquo;ve converted me to blue/water characters, LEGO. Well done! 59/70</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2016-06-09T17:28:24.673Z","Uniter of Water","<p>With the Bionicle Reboot in its second year; we have received the fifth incarnation of Gali the Toa of Water since the original line&#39;s inception iin 2001. How does the current Gali compare against here predecessor from 2015? Can Bionicle&#39;s leading lady retain her charm in her 2016 form? Despite losing many of the positive attributes of the 2015 set, the 2016 Gali Uniter of Water brings a few good new things to the table.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The 2016 Bionicle boxes retain the hexagonal shape of the 2015 boxes, but are now sturdier and less prone to bending during shipping. The instructions are easy to understand, and contain advertisements for the other sets of the 2016 Winter Bionicle Wave.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>2016 brought a lot of new parts to the Bionicle line; and Gali&nbsp;showcases a lot&nbsp;of them. The torso shell has been a piece of contention since leaked images appeared online, and it is a bit large, overdetailed and clunky in person. However it does bring back some esthetic qualities of the original Bionicle line, so it isn&#39;t a complete disaster. CCBS shell #4 appeares in Gali&#39;s distinct azure color which is a welcome addition to the CCBS&nbsp;color&nbsp;palette. Gali&#39;s mask is new and comes in blended azure with silver, and a gold and dark transparent blue blend. Unfortunetly the light piping on the azure and silver mask is poor and Gali&#39;s trans-light blue eyes (a new piece itself)&nbsp;are dark, a sad contrast to her bright green eyes from 2015. &nbsp;However the gold and trans blue mask is spectacular, and the transparent blue allows more light in to illuminate Gali&#39;s eye stalk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also included is a new crystal styled blade piece used for the tip of Gali&#39;s staff. Two &quot;Vorox shells&quot; from Bionicle&#39;s 2009 run have been returned to production for the 2016 wave, and two appear in orange for Gali. Two new crystal armor pieces are used on Gali, blended in light silver and trans light blue plastic. Also 2016 marks the return of the 2m Technic axle returning to Bionicle in its classic black color, a piece which is used several times in Gali&#39;s build.&nbsp;The skeleton of the figure is built around a new torso beam and a leg socket, which combine together to form a rotating waist function. A large shell piece with Technic axle points (ala Bionicle shells back in 2006-2009)&nbsp;known in the community as &quot;the Uniter Shell&quot; comes in silver.&nbsp;For a $15 figure, Gali is a&nbsp;<em>plethora</em>&nbsp;of new stuff!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Gali retains the simple CCBS&nbsp;construction methods introduced in Hero Factory; but expands upon them with more Technic builds. While the results aren&#39;t always perfect, I am glad to see Bionicle return to its roots (the original 2001 line was a Technic subtheme which focused on Technic builds for its large villain sets). The added Technic pieces included help the build to last longer, and give a larger sense of completion to the figure that previous CCBS sets lacked. Bionicle has improved on the building experience in great leaps and bounds over the past few years, and this is no exception.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>First the elephant in the room; how does the 2016 set compare to the 2015 one? Sadly the 2016 set does lose some of the great features of the 2015 model. The 2015 set was one of the first Gali figures to actually look like what a woman might look like in the Bionicle world. Gali 2016 loses a lot of those features, the legs are notably stubbier due to the use of friction extenders, and while they do seem to be the same height, the ankle joint is placed one module higher than the 2015 model which also contributes to the stubbier leg look. The torso shells used on the 2016 model also make the legs look thinner, loosing the &quot;hips&quot; of the 2015 set. The arms despite being the same length as the 2015 model, are positioned slightly higher and don&#39;t come down as far, distorting the proportions of the set. The textured shell loses the smooth features of the 2015 model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With that said, Gali&nbsp;Uniter of Water does a lot of things&nbsp;<em>right</em>. The switch from yellow accents to orange accents makes a great visual contrast. While the two handed nature of the 2016 model&#39;s staff makes it harder to pose, the staff looks like a far more legitimate weapon than the oversized trident-axe of the 2015 figure. The greatest part of the visual look of the 2016 model is the asymmetry&nbsp;adopted into&nbsp;the figure. It is unique and visually distinctive, and helps Gali appear as a&nbsp;representative of the chaotic beauty found in nature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course the biggest feature of Gali 2016 requires the purchase of a separate model; the $10 USD Akida -&nbsp;Creature of Water set. With a simple snap, the two models combine into one. The friction joints on Gali&#39;s legs while unsightly, help maintain the weight of Akida once placed on Gali&#39;s&nbsp;back. With Akida on her back, Gali loses posebility; but gains far more interest visually. Akida gives Gali a regal look, and the added play feature of dual stud shooters that give Gali an additional play feature. While the synergy between these two models is wonderful, it is unfortunate that it requires to spend a total of $25 USD to obtain the duo. This problem plagues the current Bionicle line up; as the cost to acquire all six 2016 and their six creatures comes to a staggering $160 USD; the cost of a D2C&nbsp;<em>Modular Building!</em>&nbsp; While this individual figure is worth the money paid, I don&#39;t know if it drummed up enough excitement in me to purchase more than a handful of other sets this year.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Ultimately I am glad to have obtained the 2016 Gali&nbsp;Uniter of Water set. While I think the 2015 model set the bar rather high, Gali&nbsp;Uniter of Water brings a lot of new features I like to the table; from the increased playability to the more complex build. The build was very satisfying in its length, and felt complex. The visually distinct features of Gali Uniter of Water also help make the set a favorite. While the 2015 model looks better on display, ultimately the 2016 figure is far more fun to&nbsp;play with thanks to an increased focus on action features. While not perfect this set is a fun addition to my collection. I hope that if Bionicle continues into 2017, that a future Gali set will combine the best of both the 2015 and 2016 figures.&nbsp;</p>

"wolf99555","2016-03-01T04:20:30.02Z","An enjoyable cheaper figure, best of the $15 uniters","<p>I lost interest in Lego around 2008, only becoming interested again when i heard Bionicle was back around this year. As a result, Uniter Gali&nbsp;is both my first Bionicle set in years, and my first CCBS system set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the standard cardboard box, essentially&nbsp;identical to last years in design, the only really unique things about them this year is that the back advertises the &quot;united&quot; toa and creature</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Although I am new to ccbs,&nbsp;and therefore not used to many of the ccbs pieces, I have decided I&#39;ll simply focus on the ones that are new to Galui/2016</p>

<p>I have a love/hate relationship with the torso. It has a really good looking abstract design (&nbsp;I generally prefer printed pieces/stickers be&nbsp;something that would be painted, and this design fits that perfectly); and features the heavy greebling from Gen 1 that&nbsp;I felt was missing from the 2015 models.</p>

<p>But unfortunately it is a single piece, meaning you get very little customization with it, and due to it featuring Gali&#39;s&nbsp;color scheme i feel it&#39;d be hard to fit this on a custom creation. I would have much preferred&nbsp;it to be at least two separate pieces (perhaps using the clip on armor system?)</p>

<p>The crystal armor add-ons are lovely, featuring a solid color base (in Gali&#39;s case silver) blending to a transparent tip (light blue). They give of a very powerful feeling.</p>

<p>The crystal blade piece is equally good looking, looking very fierce. Gali features a silver one with a large light blue &quot;blade&quot;</p>

<p>Finally,&nbsp;Gali&nbsp;has a new mask, two to be precise. I feel this one is a bit inferior to the 2015 version, although looking at it I&#39;m not sure why. Her regular mask blends azure to silver, and her unity mask blends pearl gold to dark trans blue. The secondary colored tops has a crystalline appearance, and feature several symbols (including the gen 1 &quot;nuva&quot; symbol)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Gali&#39;s build is as enjoyable as you&#39;d expect for a ccbs model, and features a fairly custom torso build and all the toa so far have.</p>

<p>I felt mildly suprised by how they worked her orange shoulder armor in, but other than that nothing was particularly interesting about it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Completed Gali looks lovely, my favorite of the $15 uniters</p>

<p>Her color scheme of azure mixed with silver and dark trans blue, complimented with some bright orange. I love this color scheme so much and would love to see it more. The orange even gives of the feeling of tropical coral!</p>

<p>Her armor design is rather asymmetric, some may not like this, but i really enjoy it. It gives her a more lightweight, agile warrior look, which is very fitting for a toa of water.</p>

<p>I quite like how how the greebled&nbsp;and crystalline parts look together. As i mentioned earlier the gen 1 Bionicles had a lot of greebling that i felt 2015 missed. I am very happy with how much the 2016 models fixed this, feeling now like proper Bionicles.</p>

<p>Her weapon is a spear, which although simple in concept (and rather over done in Bionicle), looks rather nice thanks to the crystal piece and the addition of of a spinner, which I like to think lets her move water with her attacks. The use of a spear actually compliments the primary actions feature quite well.</p>

<p>Said action feature is the ability to spin a gear to make her torso rotate, allowing her to stab with her spear. This is well enough on its own, but it has the added benefit of giving waist articulation, something many Bionicle fans have wanted for a long time. In addition to this you can spin the propeller on her spear, which is very fun if a bit simplistic.</p>

<p>Finally she can be united with&nbsp;Akida &nbsp;(71302). Together they are one of the more boring combinations i feel (despite being some of my favorite&nbsp;of their two &quot;groups&quot;). The only really interesting features this adds to Gali are the tail and the shoulder mounted cannons.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I feel Gali is a great set, incredibly worth the asking price for how many parts you get, how useful they are (sans the massive torso piece), and how nice the final model is.</p>
