"DarterTheVanquisher","2016-02-01T22:59:25.653Z","Goldy!","<p>This set was one of my purchases at the Lego store. He is my second form of Tahu that I have. He is a pretty cool set. On to the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same style as the older ones from last year, however they are made with thicker cardboard. If you have read my other reviews you know that I prefer the older foil bags that we saw with the old Hero Factory sets. The instructions are standard Bionicle ones that have the comic in the front, the artwork showing all six uniters and their respective creatures. Also is the unite feature an ad for the new mask of control and lastly the Netflix ad.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set sadly comes with two of the skull villain add on in pieces in gold. I say sad because they are rotting decay type pieces. Not for heroic guys. We get two of the new elemental swords in orange, and the older hero factory flame pieces in orange and red. Gold boots, some of the older ccbs add ons from last year in gold, the new crystal armor add on in gold and orange. Lastly we get the new torso piece hip piece and chest armor. And some unity armor in gold. Plus the mask of course in red and silver and gold and trans orange.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was annoying. I like my action figure builds to be quick and simple for the most part. All this technic with the custom shoulders and torso. All this Lego is doing to try and please an unpleasable group, without going to the older system. I liked last years gearbox and how it did not affect the rest of the model. The new bone torso piece I do not like as it means that you must make custom shoulders for each figure. For a fan that started with Hero Factory and simple snap snap builds it is a little to much. All the stated it was still fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set has to much gold. Tahu is the Uniter of Fire not of gold. Save the gold for characters like the Mask Maker. The gold is not as shiny as on the box. All that said it is a cool figure. The swords are really cool as they can extend out to be longer, and connect to make a long staff. With the new action feature you can make Tahu swing his staff at enemies by turning a gear back and forth.&nbsp;There is a lot of dark azure in this set with two fang like things on the feet and the&nbsp;highlights on the chest. The posable parts of this set are okay to allow the added heft of a creature on his back he has friction add ons on both the hips and the ankles. This makes it harder to stand him up. The use of shoulder armor is not great because the piece first appeared in dark pearl gray in skull army sets. It was used as a decaying flesh armor to add to the undead look. Now seen in gold on a heroic leader of heroes it looks cool but out of place, don&#39;t get me wrong having it in gold is cool. From the back it is really nice compared to Hero Factory sets of old. But all that is due to custom shoulder joints and technical bits to fill up the back. I like back armor in the form armor shells mounted on the back like with skull grinder. The new sword pieces can be bent a little too easily for my liking but when you think of old parts that would snap easily it is not to bad.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The new line of heroes is unique in the fact that you get the set and to complete the character you need to buy another set. That is annoying, value wise these sets are below last years heroes in terms of what you get per set with the transport mode in all of them. Still the sets are not bad. All that said this is still a really nice set. The old gear box was cooler then that&nbsp;new hip movement thing. The technical in the torso is annoying but when you are done building the set it does not matter anymore. This set looks cooler then the other one but the other version of him is cooler. I like the weapons but they are big and technic filled for a weapon. I reccomend this set if you want this years stuff and you like Tahu if you just want a Tahu get last years model as it is better.</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2016-03-07T01:33:03.923Z","Could Have Been Better","<p>Hello! It&#39;s PicnicBasketSam, reviewing another of the LEGO sets which I received for my birthday. I got this one today, and I&#39;m feeling quite displeased with it. I&#39;m not sure why the designs for this year&#39;s Toa are so very lacking in unique-ness... they&#39;re all essentially the same model mixed around a bit, and all&nbsp;have flat torsos, waist rotation, about the same height, and a two-handed Technic weapon. So what makes this one different from the rest?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very similar to Umarak&#39;s. Same size, same thick cardboard, same ads and logos and warnings on the back. Instructions were very clear and arrived without any unpleasant creasing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a few new parts and a lot of nice recolors. We get Tahu&#39;s mask, which looks a lot better in real life than in the picture off to the side here. Also, we get a beautifully printed torso shell, two crystalline blended swords, the Piece of Unification in gold, and a crystal-like blended armor shell that looks awesome... and, oddly, a 3M axle with a stopper in reddish brown. Not sure how to use it. There&#39;s also the new eyestalk and torso, which can be found in all 7 spring large-ish sets. The torso is overly detailed, but it doesn&#39;t stick out too much in this insanely-textured model; on Lewa it REALLY stands out.</p>

<p>For recolors, there are Skull Villain armor addons in gold, Bohrok eyes in Friends blue, and red 6M shells.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None. Not even a shadow trap. :( These guys could really use some small villains to fight... I miss the Skull Spiders. Maybe there were budgetary reasons... you hardly ever find this many pieces in a $20 Constraction set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took about 20 minutes while watching a movie. There is a LOT of Technic, and it&#39;s not actually very interesting. The torso I got didn&#39;t squeak when I put it together, which is very nice.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>My first impression here was the color scheme. It is OVERWHELMINGLY gold and transparent neon orange, which the blue accents really make pop. Then the textures... ever single part of his body has differently textured armor, some of which is better than others. The decaying armor on his shoulders really doesn&#39;t belong. There is a lot of obnoxious dark grey around the legs and torso, and the silver on his mask doesn&#39;t work when there&#39;s no other silver on him. If you should get this guy, put the gold and neon orange mask on, it works so much better with his color scheme. The weapons are pretty cool; not as cool as a lava surfboard, but the gimmick is fun and they&#39;re easy to pose with. Being able to combine them is awesome.</p>

<p>Tahu has a whole doesn&#39;t look fantastic, though. His shape is just so generic, the only sticking-out detail on him is the width of his shoulders and disproportionate-ness of his armoring. He might look better with Ikir... unfortunately, I do not have Ikir, as my local Target store is sold out of all of the creatures and the smaller Toa.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion is very mixed. There are a lot of cool things and a lot of bad things; I say if you don&#39;t mind the color and texture problems, he&#39;s a fine set, and a worthy opponent for Umarak the Hunter. Again, he could be improved with the unification feature... but Ikir looks better by itself than Tahu does anyway.</p>

<p>VERDICT: Get if if you don&#39;t mind the color and texture things, otherwise scrap it for parts.</p>
