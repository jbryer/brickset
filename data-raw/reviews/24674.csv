"ThoughtLash","2016-01-03T22:28:07.287Z","The Hunter (cue Dokken!)","<p>Umarak is my first of the wave 3 BIONICLEs, and is my favorite one yet.&nbsp;The design is imposing, and he has a kaiju-like feel that I love.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The basic cardboard box, with name/parts/number/age warning on it. The instructions feature a comic on the front page, showing Umarak discovering and donning the Mask of Control.&nbsp;I found no misprints, although my booklet was bent.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts selection here is excellent.&nbsp;The&nbsp;bone pieces used for the horns and bow are (I think) new in the dark tan color.&nbsp;A small selection of trans-green parts are included, which look great with the Metru red spikes&nbsp;and black shells. The former are used for the ribcage and toes, along with the lower arms. All together these colors make an effective, menacing villain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Shadow Trap pieces are new, and look great.&nbsp; These are two of the three gunmetal pieces included, the third being the Uniting piece on his back.&nbsp; The traps clash somewhat with the silver chain attached to them, but otherwise look good.</p>

<p>Only one printed piece is included, the chestplate.&nbsp; This is black, with brown and silver print, showing fur and A MOUTH!&nbsp; Yeah, he has a mouth on his chest, which I find to be pretty cool for a BIONICLE.</p>

<p>For weapons, a Skull villain&#39;s sword is included, along with the bones mentioned above.&nbsp; The 6-shot stud launcher is included in black. This included the firing mechanism, 6 trans-green studs, and an extra clip of ammo.</p>

<p>Two masks are included, Umarak&#39;s currently unnamed one and the Mask of Control, which looks awesome.&nbsp;Umarak&#39;s is black and trans-green, a great combo, and appears to have a large crack and chip in the front. The Mask of Control is pearl gold, and looks like something from ancient Egypt.&nbsp; <em>Stargate</em>?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Took 15 minutes or so, normal time for a BIONICLE.&nbsp;Interesting techniques, and the hidden Shadow Trap design is really cool.&nbsp; The torso has a neat little Technic build, which I will get to later.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Umarak is very imposing upon completion. &nbsp;His horns look great, and the weapons go nicely with the figure.&nbsp; By removing his shoulder armor and toes, you can assemble a shadow trap, which is an awesome little feature.&nbsp; A knob on his back can be turned, to make his body twist like a Rahkshi.&nbsp; Twisting the handle of his bow fires off the trans-green studs.</p>

<p>Any of the six beasts can be &quot;united&quot; by connecting them to Umarak&#39;s back, Phantoka style.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have any of them yet, so I couldn&#39;t test this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>==EDIT==</p>

<p>I&#39;ve since obtained Ketar and Akida, although I haven&#39;t tested the latter yet. The creatures merge seamlessly, very reminiscent of the 2008 line.&nbsp; Umarak looks very impressive when combined with Ketar, as the scorpion&#39;s blades appear as extra arms.&nbsp; I&#39;d say the Uniting feature is effective, especially for display.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly, HIGHLY recommend this set.&nbsp; Definitely a better villain than the Skull *insert name here*s.</p>

"DarterTheVanquisher","2016-01-26T18:11:30.647Z","Mask Of Control!","<p>This set was one of my first 2016 sets that I picked up. I wanted the Mask of Control to go with my mask of Creation. This is a good set on to the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set came with the now standard bionicle cardboard boxes, but rather then the thinner poster paper that we got before we got standard cardboard. Which is an improvement as we no longer will have ripped boxes on store shelves. I do not like these boxes when I think of the older foil bags that were really cool. The instructions feature an ad for Umarak uniting with all six different creatures, images of all six new uniters, and an ad for the new Netflix series and lastly the new Mask Of Control app which has not been released yet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with two masks, the Mask of Control, and a really cool dark mask that he normally wears. He has the parts to build a shadow trap, the new ribcage piece in dark trans-green some new horn pieces for the antlers. Large bone wing pieces that came from the beasts a few years ago. Some nice technic bits including some more Hero Factory Cuff chain link pieces for the tail. some nice armor add on spikes in brown and many more.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This build is really complicated, people who wish for more technic in new Bionicles will be happy as the lower leg is all new technic build. The new action feature torso has only one ball joint connector for the head, and it requires custom shoulder build with each figure. So as a result the whole torso is full of technic build. the bow is fun to build and is the largest of the new style of bow. The antlers is unique to build but older fans will not think so.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This model is HUGE. Older fans again will think that compared to 2008 Takunuva he is small. If you thought that Skull Grinder was to small well he is bigger. even with the horns aside he is still bigger. I for one do not think that Skull Grinder was to small. The bow is really nice but I wish that we would see other types of shooters in this new line or something as the stud shooter fells weak. I wish that something like Rocka&#39;s bow with the Ball shooter in it would feel more powerful as opposed to small pellets being fired with not much power behind them. I want more powerful launchers in the future. The bow like skull warrior is not his only weapon. He gets another new Skull Sword piece. Instead of how Skull Grinder gets his with it just it sitting in his hand he has a wheel pulley piece with more green ammo in it with a length of chain attached to it to a axle connector with a new technic peg in it. all that can attach to his hip on a cool holster for it. Having this sword is really nice as you can engage in melee with enemies as all the toa for the most part have only swords or axes. one really cool feature is that you take the shadow trap halves that are on his shoulders and some small extra bits and you can make a shadow trap using also his claws on the feet. So he can tak part of himself and make a minion. REALLY cool. Action feature can be hard to use unlike the gearboxes of last year, which I prefer.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is important for collectors as it has the mask of control. Being the only Villain in a wave has its downsides as you cannot pick another bad guy. Unlike the Lord Of Skull Spiders (which I have) he works as a powerful boss villain that the Toa will need to fight along the way. I would suggest that you get this set, but if are choosing between mask of control and creation go with creation.</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2016-03-05T22:39:14.883Z","Best Reboot Villain Yet!","<p>Hello, denizens of Brickset! It&#39;s me, PicnicBasketSam, reviewing one of the sets I got for my birthday: Umarak the Hunter. And because I hate starting off reviews with a question, I&#39;m going to say straight-out that this is my favorite Bionicle set ever. I only own about 8 Bionicles, but still. My definite favorite of the bunch. Read on to find out why.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same $20 reboot size, but it&#39;s actually made of cardboard like other LEGO sets (for example, 70314, of which a review is coming soon.) It has the 2016 Bionicle logo with the Mask of Control, and green ooze dripping off of it. The instructions are normal high quality, and were notably not bent in the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a large number of great parts in here. Highlights include the two exclusive masks, the dark tan horn/bow bits, the new torso, a shorter eyestalk, shadow trap halves, and trans-bright green 6M bones and Skull torso armor. The new torso works very well... lots of friction, and if there&#39;s too much weight on it, it squeaks. However, the squeaking varies from product to product, so yours might not do any squeaking. *shrug*</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t any. This is Bionicle. However, there is a minion included... if you notice the shadow trap halves on his shoulders, all the parts are included to make a shadow trap. Those things are cutely evil walking bear traps, and just really awesome.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about 30 minutes. There is a great deal of pushing Technic axles in. It was pretty interesting to build the torso and lower legs, however.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is pretty amazing. He looks menacing, evil, and not remotely skeletal like all the other G2 villains. The antlers are really cool, and help counterbalance the mask-knocking mechanism. The lower legs are a serious eyesore that hamper poseability, but that is my only real complaint... also, the spear on his leg lacks a handle, so he can&#39;t really hold it without messing with it or adding an extra axle, which looks very odd. Note that, contrary to what the box says, you have to remove the bear traps from his shoulders to unite him with any of the creatures should you wish to do so.</p>

<p>The ammo wheel is a clever idea. However, having it dangle from a chain like that is not clever. And the bow itself is really annoying... it doesn&#39;t actually have a knob or anything to fire with, so you have to turn this tiny little axle connector to shoot it. The handle is also much too long, to the point where I can&#39;t naturally pose him holding it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this set, and recommend it to any Bionicle fan. His lower legs really ought to be modified, and the bow is annoying, but it&#39;s a great set nonetheless.</p>

"bt_mocs","2016-10-26T18:49:58.47Z","Umarak is cool!","<p>Hi, I will do for you reviews of a set of a series of BIONICLE number 71310 or Umarak the Hunter, set consists of 172 parts.</p>

<p>Together with the main set we get the Mask of Control, one small piece of gold plastic which is a very nice feature, but on average I like the look of the mask, but as I said, is a very good addition.<br />
The box is made of cardboard thicker than in packs of 2015.<br />
&nbsp;Unpacking and is so easy and fun.<br />
After removing the bags of blocks, we see a lot of interesting blocks.<br />
Especially interesting seems to mask Umarak, there is a small but extremely pretty and detailed.<br />
I take out the blocks with bags, no it builds.<br />
Construction lasted an hour, it is not difficult to build a set, but the construction was very enjoyable.<br />
I have before me the best set of BIONICLE G2!<br />
Everything here looks perfectly!<br />
Here is very much part of a person build their MOCs.<br />
Weapons atack&nbsp;very far round plates 1X1, atack&nbsp;is very easy and convenient.Ammunition very easy to lose so the set is accompanied by 18 pieces of this small block.<br />
Kit also has another function, shaking rack on the back, you can rotate the torso.<br />
Removing blocks of arms and feet, you can build a so-called trap shadow.</p>

<p>The legs&nbsp;are constructed&nbsp;differently&nbsp;than usual&nbsp;in the&nbsp;BIONICLE&nbsp;sets,&nbsp;it looks very good.<br />
Hands&nbsp;are not perfect&nbsp;but&nbsp;this set&nbsp;is&nbsp;enough.<br />
A&nbsp;torso&nbsp;is built&nbsp;very good&nbsp;for this reason&nbsp;that it is&nbsp;not&nbsp;ordinary&nbsp;but&nbsp;a little different&nbsp;than usual.</p>

<p>Now it&#39;s time&nbsp;for the&nbsp;final evaluation&nbsp;kit.<br />
This is the best&nbsp;set of&nbsp;BIONICLE&nbsp;G2.<br />
But is&nbsp;it worth buying?<br />
Yes!&nbsp;How&nbsp;do you like&nbsp;the most&nbsp;if&nbsp;BIONICLE.<br />
For such a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;cool&nbsp;parts&nbsp;worth paying&nbsp;as much as&nbsp;costs&nbsp;Umarak&nbsp;the Hunter.<br />
I&nbsp;hope that&nbsp;you&nbsp;review&nbsp;in handy.&nbsp;Bye then!</p>
