"NBJ2016","2015-12-29T11:51:40.953Z","60106: City Fire Brigade: Fire Starter Set","<p>As of the beginning of 2015, TLG started releasing a minifigure-themed starter set for each line of products in the City theme. The one exception was 60088: Fire Starter Set, which was a rather odd decision, as there were no Fire Brigade sets to complement it. This year&#39;s fits in better with the Coastline Fire Brigade theme, even if it&#39;s nothing special.</p>

<p><strong><u>Box and Instruction Manual</u></strong></p>

<p>The box depicts two firefighters hurrying to put out a fuel tank that has caught fire on the quayside while a rescue diver rescues a worker who seems to have jumped off the of the quay in his panic. The sides shout out all the usual warnings, and the top shows off the 1:1 real-size image, along with a small image - one of the playing suggestions.</p>

<p>The instruction manual is as unchanged as ever, and can be downloaded <a href=""https://wwwsecure.us.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/search#?search&amp;text=60106%2520Fire%2520Starter%2520Set%2520City%2520Fire"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong><u>Parts selection</u></strong></p>

<p>The parts selection is excellent, and contains several new / interesting parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Black: 1/2 Circle Plate 2x6.</li>
	<li>Bright Red: Plate W. Bow 2x2x2/3 (with 2013 Fire Brigade print).</li>
	<li>Bright Red: Turbine &Oslash;&cedil;31,37 W.Holes &Oslash;&cedil; 4,85.</li>
	<li>Bright Red: Windshield element. (I&#39;m not sure what the name of this part is, as neither LEGO.com nor Rebrickable have it in their inventories at this time.)</li>
	<li>Bright Yellow: Tool Holder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each part included costs 10p (UK) / 11.1c (US), so it&#39;s pretty good value.</p>

<p><strong><u>Minifigures</u></strong></p>

<p>The minifigures are the selling point of starter sets for many fans, but this selection isn&#39;t as good as previous sets if you&#39;re into generic ones. There are four minifigures included, a worker, a speedboat driver, a rescue diver, and a normal firefighter.</p>

<p>The worker is a normal harbour mechanic, and nothing too special. He holds a black wrench.</p>

<p>The speedboat driver has a new Fire Brigade torso print, and I like it a lot, so it&#39;s a shame it&#39;s hidden by the life preserver. I believe the printing on the legs is new, too. Overall, it&#39;s a really nice minifigure, and it&#39;s always useful to have more female minifigures, given the extremely low amount we get.</p>

<p>The rescue diver also has a new torso print, which is a Fire Brigade version of the Deep-Sea Explorers one. The printing continues down to his legs, to give the impression of a wetsuit.</p>

<p>The normal firefighter is the same as the one included in 60105, but with a different head print. Nothing to say about this minifigure, as it&#39;s very generic, which is always useful for City layouts.</p>

<p><strong><u>The building process</u></strong></p>

<p>The building process takes about five minutes, and is very simple. The minifigures are constructed first, as usual, then the speedboat, then the quay. There is are two very nice techniques for building the fire extinguisher, and the fuel tank, which is rather uncommon for an impulse set.</p>

<p><strong><u>The completed model</u></strong></p>

<p>The quay is certainly very small, but I can excuse that, seeing as we have an excellent fuel tank model. It&#39;s more of an addition, to add a bit of story to the set, so I don&#39;t mind too much.</p>

<p>The speedboat is excellent, and it&#39;s the first time one of this size has appeared in a City set (excluding polybags and retailer exclusives), and I really like it. It&#39;s small, fun, and feels fresh, and I&#39;d certainly consider picking up multiples of this set just to get a fleet of speedboats.</p>

<p><strong><u>Overall opinion</u></strong></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm"">It&#39;s an excellent set, with useful minifigures, and most importantly, it&#39;s much better than last year&#39;s Starter Set. It&#39;s nice to have a proper Coastline Fire Brigade subtheme, and this does the theme justice - it has everything necessary for a harbour rescue in one set for under &pound;10. It&#39;s an excellent introduction to the subtheme, and a set I highly recommend.</p>

"Skut","2016-03-07T00:17:10.633Z","Great potential, but one very serious flaw","<p>This set is full of potential, but sadly has one serious deficiency. Be alert but not alarmed!</p>

<p>First, let me start by saying there&rsquo;s a lot to like about this set.&nbsp; The overall concept and design are excellent.&nbsp; The idea of a mini-hovercraft is a good example of Lego &ldquo;thinking outside the box&rdquo; and the whole mini-dockside vignette is well executed.</p>

<p>The minifigs are absolutely first class.&nbsp; The set contains a good spectrum of three different firefighters plus a hapless dockyard mechanic.&nbsp; The mechanic is great for play value because&nbsp;he gives the firefighters someone to rescue.&nbsp; The minifigs come with a suitable array of accessories.&nbsp; I think overall my favourite is the diver &ndash; not a frequently-found minifig in Fire sets and great to see at this low price point.</p>

<p>So why the negative review title?&nbsp; Alas, in a small set such as this one, a single omission can have a seriously adverse effect on play value.&nbsp; This year&rsquo;s other Fire sets are notable for inclusion of the new &ldquo;water shooting&rdquo; system, which is a fabulous innovation.&nbsp; (See my review of 60112 for a full description - <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/set-60112-1"">http://brickset.com/reviews/set-60112-1</a>).&nbsp; In this set, the mounting of a new-style water-shooter on the front of the hovercraft was an obvious choice.&nbsp; Instead, the model features an &ldquo;old fashioned&rdquo; static water jet and hose mounting.&nbsp; This design choice hugely restricts the play value compared to this year&rsquo;s other fire sets.&nbsp; Frankly I find it incomprehensible how this set could have gotten through Lego&rsquo;s design review process without this issue being picked up.&nbsp; If piece count or price had been a concern, the size of the mini-dock could have been halved to afford the inclusion of the new water shooting element - the overall result would still have been a lot better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t like writing negative reviews but you all deserve to be aware of this flaw before forking out your hard-earned cash on this set.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;fans&nbsp;expect TLG to maintain its very high standards of innovation and play value - the price of being the market leader is that your customers have high expectations!&nbsp; Sadly, this set fails to live up to those expectations. A (thankfully) rare failure.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

"Hashem1983","2016-11-14T10:19:36.947Z","Excellent Starter Set","<p>Though I am a big fan of Castle and Pirates theme, yet I do adore the Town/City line sets. I never had any Fire set from my childhood or was a big fan of it, but this year, 2016, I saw Lego made wonderful sets for the City Fire&nbsp;line and Police&nbsp;that got my attention but I never got my hands on it and in the end my sister got me this set when she was in Dubai and its a very wonderful set.</p>

<p><strong><u>Box and Instruction Manual</u></strong></p>

<p>It comes in the standard size box for the starter set with the City Branding. The front side displays a small dock with a small engine on fire and a fireman trying to put&nbsp;out the fire, a nice hovercraft on water also helping the fireman and a mechanic dock worker&nbsp;on water whose being rescued by a fireman diver.<br />
The back part displays a zoom in on the four minifiguers, the dock and the hovercraft.</p>

<p>The Instructions comes in folded which I don&#39;t like in small sets because it gives me a frustration while trying to keep the page and not turning, I hope TLG could make the instructions for the small sets as they used to back in the old days when it was more of a leaflet than a booklet or at least reduce the size of the booklet.</p>

<p><strong><u>Parts selection</u></strong></p>

<p>The included parts are wonderful, and some of them are new addition to me, even for the accessories.<br />
You get 2 of the 2X6 circle plate in black, 2 plates of 4X6 in blue and brown, bright red special slope piece for the hovercraft front, 2 rounded studs in transparent orange with&nbsp;a whole in it plus 1 spare, Turbine piece in bright red, motor blades, a tool holder and a cone piece in bright yellow and some normal standard bricks and plates but not to forget the printed piece of the 2X2 plate with bow that resembles the logo of the fire department.</p>

<p><strong><u>Minifigures:</u></strong></p>

<p>The set comes with four excellent minifiguers, 2 male firefighters and one of them is a diver in a diver suit, a female firefighter and a dock worker who gets to be rescued.</p>

<p>All four of them has a different and printing printing torsos, but only the dock worker does&nbsp;not have printed legs and has in plain dark blue pants, also non of them has double sided face.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Female firefighter has a white helmet with normal visor and a yellow life jacket.</li>
	<li>Ground Male Firefighter has a yellow oxygen&nbsp;tank with smoke helmet protector, a white firefighter helmet and a visor and he&#39;s holding a yellow fire extinguisher.</li>
	<li>Diver male Firefighter has white helmet with trans blue goggles, fins and he&#39;s holding a lifebuoy.</li>
	<li>The dock worker, Orange torso with a dark blue cap and legs and he&#39;s holding a wrench, also he&#39;s the only figure with a gloomy upset face.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>The Building:</u></b></p>

<p>It didn&#39;t take me that long, the hovercraft was a nice build, as for the engine on fire that was a very nice build yet it was a bit tricky but a nice one and creative as well. Over all not a dull experience.</p>

<p><b><u>The Complete Model &amp; Overall Opinion:</u></b></p>

<p>For a small set its amazing and could be inspiring as well, remember, this is a starter set so its defiantly&nbsp;going to be small but in the same time its a wonderful build. The hovercraft is great, the dock side may be small but it could be inspiring to build your own one in a bigger scale, as for the engine its quite superb, it made feel a little bit of Creator set mixed with it.</p>

<p>I loved this set and it could be added tou your small city whether you are young or adult, you could have multi of this set just for the sake of the hovercraft and the engine, it has great value and great amount of figures that could be added to your fire fighters teams.</p>
