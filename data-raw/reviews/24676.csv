"Japanbuilder","2016-02-18T10:23:34.473Z","Outstanding Ladder Truck","<p>This set is an excellent ladder truck with great design and play value.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing fancy the standard instructions we have been accustomed to lately are included. The box depicts the firefighters going about their work riding their amazing truck! It is a ladder truck after all we all know what it does.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing fancy very common pieces are included, however, I will note that this set does come with a couple of the new 1x1 round plate pieces with a hole in the center and those are precious. Already I skipped using them for the suggested portion and have them earmarked for some fancier stuff. Very useful pieces indeed. Too bad there are so few of those included.</p>

<p>I also took into account that stud shooter, I know some folk do not like them. I too usually keep those studs well away from my kids as they are very young and those are not safe to keep as loose pieces.</p>

<p>The rest is very common. There is also only one breathing aparatus&nbsp;included for our firefighters so one will have to swap out the role of actual fire fighting while the other coordinates/operates the ladder truck.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 minifigures are included in this set and they are very good. The male comes with grime and dirt on his face and it looks pretty cool. Both feature very nice prints on their legs and torsos, though if you have a lot of firefighters they are not mind blowing. The torso print for the female appears new to me though. It has a print of a cool vertical handle flashlight on it which I like.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple since it is a city set, however, I will note if you have smaller children the initial few pages may get tricky as only one color differentiates one side from the other and as the build progresses it gets obscured and your young builder may get just a tad disoriented by that. It is not too bad but even I had to flip back a few pages to spot what was happening during the initial phases of the build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model is great! The ladder extends quite a way up and the string for the water hose reaches all the way up with it. The ladder section also rotates a full 360 degrees which is a nice function. The stickers make the set really pop as well I suggest adding them if you intend to keep the model as-is. The set also features plenty of external hooks for all the extra gear the firefighters will need and then some. There is also a small storage compartment on one side for even more stuff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cab section also allows for one firefighter to sit with his or her breathing aparatus&nbsp;on which is a welcome feature. No fumbling about through racks or storage crates to get at that gear. If you have lots of firefighters two more can hang to the outside of the truck via the safety bars. It is a nice nice set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While I would love to gush over this set for a while I must confess that comparing it to the previous stand alone set (60002 I believe) it is not that different for the usual fare. If you already have a couple of the recent fire ladder trucks from city then this set has nothing more to add to your collection. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If like me this was your first, however, then embrace it. It is a very well put together and designed vehicle with a lot fo functionality for the job of dousing those flames!&nbsp;</p>

"Skut","2016-02-26T06:35:42.09Z","Amazing appliance!","<p>Well, for this&nbsp;review I&#39;m going to dip a toe into the pool of the &quot;template&quot; Brickset review structure.&nbsp; Of course I could delete the sections I don&#39;t like (as I usually do) but this time round I&#39;m going to slavishly follow the formula.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here goes...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Okay I haven&#39;t slavishly followed the formula - I have&nbsp;moved this section&nbsp;to the bottom because I couldn&#39;t bring myself to write anything serious.&nbsp; You can read it after the balance of the review if you like.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Aha.&nbsp; Something worth writing about!&nbsp; This set contains a really nice array of parts - basically what you would expect for a fire truck with no real surprises.&nbsp; You have the parts for a sound chassis and truck body, a really good ladder mechanism (much more appealing than the 2013 fire truck (60002)) and turntable, and a good array of firefighting tools.</p>

<p>The point?&nbsp; This is a great set to&nbsp;use as a building resource for other fire trucks.&nbsp; Buy two or three of these sets and you can customise them into a whole fire fleet, with ladder, rescue, salvage vehicles etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set also features the new &quot;water shooting&quot; system.&nbsp; For those unfamiliar with this innovation, the thing to note here is that the &quot;flames&quot; on the oil barrel are not fixed - they rest on the top of the barrel until you&nbsp;knock them off with the &quot;water&quot; (ie. a round trans-blue plate 1x1) thereby &quot;putting out&quot; the fire.&nbsp; A great play feature which really elevate this year&#39;s fire sets above anything that has gone before.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set contains two firefighters, one male, one female, with the same basic printing as the previous round of Fire sets from 2013 (ie. leg as well as torso printing) but with a few little details changed.&nbsp; Breathing apparatus, fire extinguisher, walkie-talkie, spade, axe, electric saw are all included.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s no one to rescue, not even a cat (or tree).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Kids&nbsp;should be pretty comfortable with this build.&nbsp; The only likely area for adult assistance is in attaching the hose to the reel, but this is a matter of one thumb knot (or a figure 8 knot if you like to do things fancy).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t take long to assemble - half an hour max for an adult; you might&nbsp;just extend it to&nbsp;an hour of relative peace if you give this to a smaller kid to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are quite a few stickers but placing them isn&#39;t too much of a drama.&nbsp; The one inexplicable sticker is the front grille of the truck - a very Speed Champions touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;A 1x2 grille piece would have been more appropriate for a City set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is well proportioned and functional.&nbsp; I would love to see more doors on City vehicles as I think they&#39;re great for play value.&nbsp; However their omission is no real detraction.&nbsp; There are no windows in the side of the crew cab but, again, this is no real detraction.&nbsp; The ladder function is great, as well as realistic (the hydraulic arms really add a lot here).&nbsp; There are plenty of useful clips for firefighting tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One tiny gripe compared to 60002 is that there is nowhere on this truck to plug in a hose to&nbsp;the hydrant, but again this is a pretty small issue and easily MOC-remedied.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The oil barrel is a bit &#39;meh&#39; but provides a good platform for the flames to perch on, prior to being shot off with the &quot;water&quot;.&nbsp; As with a number of the other Fire sets this year, there is a helpful sign to warn the firefighters that oil barrels are flammable.&nbsp; Who needs training with the nanny state to look after you?</p>

<p>Come on Lego, what about a burning stove, BBQ&nbsp;or radiator instead?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>One of Lego&#39;s strongest ever fire trucks.&nbsp; Its has good looks and functionality without any delusions of grandeur.&nbsp; This set deserves to become a classic.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Well really - what am I meant to say in this section - &quot;This set comes in a box&quot;?&nbsp; It&#39;s a City fire truck.&nbsp; It comes in a box of a size you would expect for a City&nbsp;fire truck.&nbsp; The box is made of diamond-encrusted platinum - sorry, that&#39;s not right - cardboard.&nbsp; It has a picture of a City fire truck on the front.&nbsp; The back&nbsp;features various pictures of a City fire truck and its crew fighting fires.&nbsp; The box also handily features the set number to enable you to avoid the embarrassing situation of going to the shops to get the Death Star and returning with a fire truck by mistake.&nbsp; The box also has a handy &quot;crushability&quot; feature - you can stand on it after you have emptied the contents and it will flatten, as if my magic, thereby taking up less space in the recycling bin.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instructions.&nbsp; This set includes instructions.&nbsp; Lego has&nbsp;included instructions with some of its&nbsp;other sets over the years.&nbsp; Of course there are other ways to go about assembling your set - you can randomly put parts together until you have something that looks like a fire truck.&nbsp; But I think the instructions method works better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What about the quality of the instructions? Lego has once again gone for pictorial instructions.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m a fan.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to see a bit more variety here - what about written instructions for a bit of variety:&nbsp; &quot;Step 268: rotate the 1x4 red plate through 270 degrees in the horizontal plane and 90 degrees in the vertical plane then affix to the third stud on the aforementioned 2x4 red brick.&quot;&nbsp; Now THAT would make for some entertaining builds!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think I&#39;m going to revert to &quot;non-template&quot; reviews again in the future.&nbsp; Finis.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a small-medium sized&nbsp;box and has the requisite graphics to grab a child&#39;s attention.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Due to this being a fire ladder truck, I expected some cool parts and this set delivered.&nbsp; The cool parts for me were the turntable, pistons, and&nbsp;yellow stud blaster.&nbsp; While I&#39;m not a huge fan of the stud blasters as guns because of the bulk, the size seems more appropriate for a fire hose attachment, the yellow color is neat and I liked how it is tethered to the &quot;hose&quot; with a ball joint.&nbsp; The &quot;hose&quot; is a braided string, which I found to be a good thickness to act as a hose.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures with nice detailed printing for their uniforms, including on the legs.&nbsp; I really liked the SCBA set up using the tank, hoses,&nbsp;helmet, and&nbsp;an upside down visor.&nbsp; I&#39;ll admit that looks pretty cool!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was good for my 4yo son to build most of with my help on certain parts, like the hose and pistons.&nbsp; The turning and articulating ladder were fun to build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set captures that classic ladder truck&nbsp;look very well.&nbsp; It is simple, fun, and practical (as in, what city doesn&#39;t need a fire ladder truck?).&nbsp; The red color with white striping looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some negatives - I wish there were real doors to the cab as opposed to having to pop off the roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, the light bar on the roof is a&nbsp;bit plain and could have included more detail.&nbsp; Furthermore, it would have been nice to incorporate a siren horn for even more added detail.</p>

<p>One small mod&nbsp;I made was to swap out the flat white part on the roof with a studded one.&nbsp; This was to&nbsp;give the ability to &quot;lock&quot; the ladder into place when it is down and resting on the roof.&nbsp; The gap between the rungs&nbsp;looks to be purposefully designed to fit studs; however, the instructions have you putting a studless section on the roof where the ladder rests and this causes it to rotate freely when playing with the truck.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great addition to any City collection, because every city needs fire protection!&nbsp; Whether adding to an existing collection of City sets, or just simply because it is a cool fire truck, this is a very good and basic set for any LEGO fan.</p>

"Percypoppins","2019-02-18T05:47:04.39Z","Very good lego set","<p>The build on this fire truck is fun and reasonable easy when following the instructions. The fire truck appears to be quite sturdy and well built, in that pieces don&#39;t pop off the final build as with some other lego&nbsp;sets I have used.</p>

<p>As far as the minifigs are concerned my only issue is the breathing apparatus interrupts the hat and visor snapping back back onto the head.</p>

<p>All up I am impressed with this set.</p>

"Nemesis101","2019-04-06T10:47:00.003Z","Bad block quality ","<p>I bought this set for the Lego city of me and my two boys.</p>

<p>The fire ladder truck is a nice set with a fun build. It could be a coincidence, but the quality of some bricks is problematic. One of the minifigs had a broken arm so the hand falls off and other bricks are like &quot;C&quot; quality. They just don&#39;t stick well enough and always fall off quickly. Not something you may expect of Lego.</p>

<p>Must admit that I have never had this with Lego before.</p>
