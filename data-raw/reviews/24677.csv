"Skut","2016-02-28T23:14:37.633Z","Finally, Lego gets a fire helicopter right  ","<p>This is a very strong set.&nbsp; For years, nay decades, Lego has produced fire helicopters featuring either waterguns pointed out the front of the chopper or devil-may-care firefighters dangling out of doorways waving hoses around (or both).&nbsp; Both&nbsp;features are seriously unrealistic and appear to owe more to the concept of a helicopter gunship rather than a firefighter.&nbsp; Set 7206 offered a ray of hope back in 2010 with a &ldquo;bambi bucket&rdquo; included (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7206-1/Fire-Helicopter"">http://brickset.com/sets/7206-1/Fire-Helicopter</a>) but still featured a firefighter dangling in the breeze, whilst more recently, in 2013, 60010 (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60010-1/Fire-Helicopter"">http://brickset.com/sets/60010-1/Fire-Helicopter</a>) seemed to be an anti-submarine design posing as a firefighter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happily, 60108 remedies these issues and is a dedicated water bomber.&nbsp; No silly hoses, no dangling firefighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, to the parts.&nbsp; As well as containing all you need for the chopper, plus a bike (see below), the most notable addition (which I can&rsquo;t yet see on the Brickset parts list) is a new 1x6x5 corrugated panel.&nbsp; You can easily see this part on the sides of the building featured on the box art.&nbsp; The corrugation is like the side of a shipping container and promises a lot of MOC possibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set contains three minifigs &ndash; pilot, motorcycle-riding firefighter and careless welder (I don&rsquo;t think that last one is the official Lego name but I think it&rsquo;s accurate).&nbsp; They are solid inclusions &ndash; it&rsquo;s good to have someone to rescue (unlike a lot of the other Fire sets this year).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build for this set is pretty simple.&nbsp; Kids should be able to manage it without many issues, although pushing the tyres onto the wheels may be too much for small fingers and thumbs.&nbsp; The mechanism for attaching the engines to the sides of the chopper deserves a mention; it&rsquo;s most ingenious and the result looks great.&nbsp; There are quite a few stickers and you will need to be accurate in application to get the paint lines on the helicopter looking nice.&nbsp; Sticker application to the tail is also required, as it has been in a number of other sets over the years, and applying a sticker to this tail element (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-6239"">http://brickset.com/parts/design-6239</a>) is always tricky.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model is very sturdy and swooshable.&nbsp; The overall playability of the set: GREAT!&nbsp; The roof of the building is mounted on pins so it can flip through 180 degrees.&nbsp; After loading 5 round trans-blue bricks (the &ldquo;water&rdquo;) into the chopper through a hatch in front of the main rotor hub, one hovers the chopper over the building and swings down the release mechanism in the bottom of the chopper, allowing the &ldquo;water&rdquo; to fall onto the roof; the force of the impact causes the roof to flip over so the flames are hidden inside the building, thereby &ldquo;putting out&rdquo; the fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These sort of interactive firefighting features are a great innovation and really add to the playability of this year&rsquo;s Fire sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set also includes a Fire motorcycle.&nbsp; It uses the Lego &ldquo;superbike&rdquo; bodyshell (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-20249"">http://brickset.com/parts/design-20249</a>) with a clip-on fire extinguisher for the firefighter to use.&nbsp; This would seem to lead to a pretty repetitive conversation at fires:</p>

<p>Fire motorbike: *ROARRR*&nbsp; *SCREECH*</p>

<p>Careless welder/other fire victim: &ldquo;Wow, you got here fast!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moto-firefighter: &ldquo;Yep. Now stand aside, I&rsquo;m going to fight that huge fire on the roof with this tiny fire extinguisher.&rdquo; *PSSSCH*</p>

<p>Careless welder/other fire victim: &ldquo;That didn&rsquo;t really seem to do much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Moto-firefighter: &ldquo;Hmm.&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d better radio for the chopper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, motorbikes are always fun so I guess it adds to play value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drawbacks: of course there are always a few.&nbsp; The chopper&rsquo;s release mechanism for the water feels a little bit wrong &ndash; it is under friction so must be swung down rather than simply popped open.&nbsp; Some sort of trap door with a release catch would have felt like it could release the water in a more convincing rush.&nbsp; Likewise, some sort of retractable hanging hose to refill the chopper from a hover (like on an Erickson aircrane waterbomber, for example) should have been included.&nbsp; I have already MOCed such a hose onto my chopper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One word of caution: this set&nbsp;feels a little bit overpriced (at twice the cost of 60107 ladder truck, for example).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final analysis: this set&rsquo;s absolutely first class.&nbsp; Despite the high cost, it&rsquo;s well worth getting.&nbsp; Wait for a Lego sale to get the price down a bit.&nbsp;</p>

"Sobel","2016-03-20T12:14:35.817Z","Again, a nicely designed helicopter with good functions","<p>First of all, this was again a spontaneous buy, because I found this set at a special sale for only <strong>19,99&euro;</strong>. I would not have bought it for the normal price of 29,99&euro;, but 20&euro; is a very good price for such a multifunctional model!<br />
It has some good functions, nice minifigures, and a cool looking motorcycle! <strong>*VROOM VROOM*</strong>!!!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I like the design of the chassis of the motorcycle, this is the first of these parts I got! The rest of the parts is OK, again one of the big problems of the actual helicopters is, that there is so much <strong>wasted space in the back of the chopper.</strong><br />
The container also features some tools, a gas burner and gas bottles, which is quite nice!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with <strong>three minifigures</strong>, which is good for a model of this size. There are two firefighters, one female pilot and one driver for the motorcyle. The third minifigure is some kind of moron worker who puts his gas burner directly next to some dangerous inflammable material! Seriously, why?!!?<br />
Oh, but well, the LEGO firefighters need work, so...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy, not much to say here. Takes only about some 20 minutes. Lots of stickers for a model of this size, which I personally disapprove...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Of course, what you get here is nothing spectacular. The chopper is not that big, and has only one single function, but that matters! You can &quot;<strong>extinguish</strong>&quot; the fire on the container by dropping &quot;water&quot; from a hatch on the underside of the helicopter! If you aim it right, the <strong>movable roof </strong>of the container flips, so it looks as if the fire is out now.<br />
But this has also a little thing on the downside: my 4-yo daughter immediately stated this: &quot;<strong>Daddy, now it burns on the inside</strong>!!&quot; Yeeeaaaaahhh, riiiiight.... But, well, would have been difficult to find another solution for this, I guess...<br />
The motorcycle makes a good addition, even though it would perhaps be not that useful in a real fire-fighting-mission, dealing with a large container full of easily inflammable stuff with a small hand-extinguisher...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While being a little overpriced at it&#39;s normal retail price, it makes a nice addition to a City-themed collection (or a for a friend of LEGO helicopters, like me! ;-) ) Clearly, this set does not focus on special parts or a large quantity of functions, but on <strong>playability</strong> and <strong>combination</strong> with other sets! I lent it to my little girl, and she immediately put it together with her other LEGO fire-fighter-sets and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60097-1/City-Square"">LEGO City Square. </a>Even though being a little out of place, the motorcycle is a cool-looking addition, I don&#39;t want to miss!<br />
Improvements could be made using the space in the helicopters back and covering the hole, where you &quot;refill&quot; the water tank of the helicopter. Also the cockpit could&#39;ve been designed a little more nicely.<br />
A solid 4 Stars here.</p>

"Brickstarr","2017-08-17T20:12:54.73Z","Fire Fire !","<p>Overall this is a fun set for children to play with, which is worth the &pound;25 that it is priced at. It comes with 3 minifigs, a pilot, a firefighter and a workman, a helicopter that releases blue bricks to fight the fire in the small tool shed and a motorbike.</p>

<p>On the whole it is excellent value for money although if your funds are limited, you could also get the Ninjago City Chase for &pound;15.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>The set contains a female pilot minifig with a smiling face, a green/silver Hi-Vis jacket with a pocket and lots of tools.On her back she has the fire symbol, more tools but no leg printing. She also has a white helmet with a transparent visor. Next we have a fire fighter who drives a motorbike. He is the same as his colleague except for some pockets and Hi-Vis printing on his legs. The workman has a grinning face with stubble, a red helmet with ear defenders, orange overalls that show a maroon jumper and finally dark blue trousers.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>Pros - great value for money, helicopter and a building</p>

<p>Cons - Helicopter was&nbsp;a bit of an easy&nbsp;build and the set only contained only 3 minfigs, while the Ninjago City Chase (mentioned above) has 5 minifigs for a cheaper price</p>

<p>I am glad that I bought the set although it could have done with a few more minifigs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;thank you for reading</p>

<p>I hope it was helpful. :-)</p>
