As a big fan of LEGO boats, this set was a must-have and I can say I am quite pleased with the execution of this set.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The set goes together quite easily (it is, in fact, recommended for ages 6-12) with a small number of stickers. My set actually included a broken hull, so I had to wait (annoyingly) about 2 weeks for LEGO to send over a new one. Besides that probably unique issue, the build was rather enjoyable and very quick.</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Product</strong></p>

<p>The finished boat looks amazing and also functions very well. The lighthouse and shack are both very simple builds helping the set be a more complete playset.&nbsp;While the included lighthouse and shack are&nbsp;nice additions, I&#39;ve found this set pairs very nicely with 31051: Lighthouse Point. As for the ship itself, there is plenty of room for minifgures on the deck and even some nice space inside the ship. The deck is also quite detailed with plenty of tools and lights to help put out the fire. The small yellow rescue raft is a nice addition with a simple motor design and enough room for two or possibly even three minifigures. The main yellow water cannon has a great range of motion and even includes a stud-shooter for added playability.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set includes four firemen (including one diver and one conning the vessel) and a lighthouse worker (presumably).</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>All in all, the LEGO City Fire Boat (60109) is a very nice set whether for a child to play with or to be added to a lego city layout. This set seems very pricey at&nbsp;&pound;64.99 / $79.99 / 69.99&euro; with the price-per-part being&nbsp;15.8p / 19.4c / 17.0c. However, you have to remember that hull piece is quite pricey by itself. Thankfully I got this set on sale for what seems like should&#39;ve been the original MSRP. Aside from the steep price, this set was greatly executed and I look forward to more boats to come from the LEGO group. If you can afford it, I&#39;d highly recommend this set!</p>
