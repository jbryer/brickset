<p>This set goes together very easily as it is recommended for ages 5-12. The stickers in this set are plentiful but add another level of detail to the fire&nbsp;truck itself and the trailer (w/ bucket-lift) in tow. The large TV antenna is also a very simple and quick build with a few placeable fire elements. There are two stickers that make it clear it is television&nbsp;related but are unnecessary in my opinion.&nbsp;The hardest part of this set (if there really even is one) would be spooling the string for the hose.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set includes three minifigures altogether including two firemen and a TV antenna repairman (presumably). There are enough minifigures to have one driving the truck, one working the bucket/lift, and one working the base of the antenna. Any more minifigures might&#39;ve been overkill.</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Product</strong></p>

<p>All in all, this set looks great as a fire truck and functions quite well as a playset. The truck has big bulky wheels that create a heavy-duty look for the truck. There is also two shutter doors in the back of the truck with room for a crate to store supplies/equipment. The trailer includes adequate detail with various levers&nbsp;and lights. The trailer also includes two stabilizer legs that move very nicely. The hose on the structure includes plenty of extra string and even has its own place on the bucket so a fireman doesn&#39;t have to worry about holding it. Rather than the traditional hose, the set includes a stud-shooter for an added play element.&nbsp;The boom works very nicely and can spin a full 360 degrees.</p>

<p>Finally, the TV antenna tower looks very good (albeit it is a bit small) and includes a small console at the base and an adjustable antenna at the top.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The Fire Utility Truck (60111) was another great addition to the fire-city line-up for 2016. The price seems adequate for this set (maybe a little high if anything) but is easy to overcome with the usual 20% discount that most major retailers seem to provide. This set would be a good set for children to play with or for anyone who is looking for another fire truck for their city layout. Although this&nbsp;set came out about 4.5 years ago (from the writing of this review), resale on this set has been hovering around MSRP, so if you have the chance to pick up this set at a reasonable rate,&nbsp;I would highly recommend it!</p>
