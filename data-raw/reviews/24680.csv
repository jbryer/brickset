Unfortunately I own&nbsp;a station wagon that is best for getting groceries. With&nbsp;Lego City set 60113 Rally Car I can live my dream of sliding&nbsp;around a muddy race course at high speeds without worrying about my daughter throwing up in the back seat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box is typical of a small Lego City set. The back has a nice pic over the shoulder of the driver that shows off a nice printed piece that represents the instrument cluster.</p>

<p>104 parts make up this set, 8 extra pieces are included.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a few unique printed parts in this set. Four&nbsp;1x1 round&nbsp;white tiles printed with the word light and pair of eyes&nbsp;are prominently&nbsp;displayed on the front of the car, (there is an extra one included). The instrument cluster/dashboard is a 1x2 cheese slope printed with 2 gages, a speedometer&nbsp;and a tachometer. I really like this element and I expect&nbsp;it will show up in many more Lego vehicles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;You&#39;ll also&nbsp;get three bent skeleton arms and three&nbsp;1x1 technic beams.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;is printed on the front and back of its torso with an &quot;Airborne&quot; logo. The head is single sided. No minifig&nbsp;accessories are included.</p>

<p>The build is quick. The instructions are easy to follow. There are six stickers to apply.&nbsp;I don&#39;t usually put all the stickers on sets I build, but the the parts that get stickers in this set are not parts that I can see myself reusing so I put them all on. The stickers&nbsp;add detail to the model and are easy to put on nice and straight. I think it looks good without the stickers as well, so if you hate applying stickers you won&#39;t end up with a plain looking car.</p>

<p>Once I finished the build I was thinking about how I would like to modify it. I don&#39;t see this as bad thing. I am thinking about buying a second set and swapping parts to build one mostly yellow and one mostly black Rally car. I like the shape and stance of the car, but I&#39;m not sure if I like the rear wing. The car looks good without the wing, so leaving it off is an option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This is reminiscent of&nbsp;and&nbsp;big improvement over the last Rally Car released back in 1987. Although that set had some nice features, like&nbsp;opening doors.&nbsp;You&#39;ll need to take the roof off the new model to get the minifig in.<img alt="""" src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/images/1496-1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>60113&nbsp;has 104 parts and cost $10 in the U.S. so it hits the $0.10 per part that many people seem to think is a good indicator of a fair&nbsp;price. I didn&#39;t mind paying full price for it and I will surely&nbsp;buy a second set...maybe two more&nbsp;if I see it at a discount.</p>

<p>I think this set&nbsp;is a good start&nbsp;for Rally Car MOCs and I look forward to building a few more cars&nbsp;based off the instructions but using alternate colors.</p>

"Schmoobin","2016-03-27T14:35:21.417Z","Ridin' Dirty","<p>Box/Instructions: The box and the instruction manual are small. &nbsp;Of course, on the box, there is a picture of the model in action on the front and the play features on the back. &nbsp;It&#39;s one of those small boxes with the push-thumb tabs. &nbsp;There is not much to say about the instructions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: though there are a few stickers (which are not a pain to put on thank goodness) there are a total of five&nbsp;special printed elements, four of which are the same. &nbsp;The pieces that really stood out for me though were the two&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6100030"">Beam 1X1</a>&nbsp;pieces from 2015.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: &nbsp;The set comes with one single minifigure, the racer himself. &nbsp;He has printed sunglasses and a white helmet for protection. &nbsp;The front and back of his torso are printed with racer decals, but the legs are left plain.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: &nbsp;This was actually a short, fun build. &nbsp;Building it probably takes around 10-20 minutes tops. &nbsp;There are a couple SNOT techniques used for the front and back bumper/headlights.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: It&#39;s a nice rally car. &nbsp;The completed model comes with a 3 piece checkered flag. &nbsp;This set is great for younger builders or people who like small LEGO City sets. &nbsp;You can remove the top piece for the minifigure to get in, that means sadly there are no doors. &nbsp;There is much playability in this, for you can race your friends to the finish line!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: I really like the LEGO City sets. &nbsp;They are cheaper than Licensed Themes (I really enjoy the Star Wars theme) and have a very wide range of sets like LEGO Star Wars. &nbsp;The value for money is great, 10 American dollars for this great set. &nbsp;You should totally get this set for your kid this Easter, it&#39;s fun and affordable! 4/5</p>

"koen_theys","2016-09-13T14:12:39.287Z","Let's rally the team","<p>Team Airborne Spoilers has gone Rally this time.</p>

<p>After 2013&#39;s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60019-1/Stunt-Plane"">60019 Stunt Plane</a>, and 2013&#39;s <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60027-1/Monster-Truck-Transporter"">60027 Monster Truck Transporter</a>, Team Airborne Spoilers is back with a new playing field, Rally!</p>

<p>I got this set for my daughter of 4. In my opinion it is a nice looking small set. We have nothing personal with rally, it just looked a nice and fun set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Normal LEGO City Box. On the backside there are several images of playability.</p>

<p>There is 1 booklet. The instructions are very simple and the building progress is very basic, about 2 or 3 pieces per built. Ideal for young builders.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>1 special part, being the PRINTED headlights covers. My daughter didn&#39;t like them as the face is looking angry. I however, love them. It gives the rally car some attitude.</p>

<p>6 bricks can be fitted with a sticker.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The hood</li>
	<li>The doors (that do not open)</li>
	<li>The roof</li>
	<li>The rear spoiler</li>
	<li>The checkered flag (2 stickers, one on each side of the flag)</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, on the sticker sheet, each sticker is numbered, for example, 1, 2, 3 ... so builders know the sequence of the stickers.</p>

<p>And there is also a printed dashboard tile.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>1 minifig, Airborne Spoilers printed, but different torso than <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60019-1/Stunt-Plane"">60019 Stunt Plane</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60027-1/Monster-Truck-Transporter"">60027 Monster Truck Transporter</a>,</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For an adult, a plain simple built. Nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>My daughter (4 years and 3 months) was very exacted. This was gonna be her first built. I picked out the parts and she followed the instructions, step by step. I had to help three times, the rest of the built was ace.</p>

<p>O yes, almost forgot, I put on the stickers on the bricks.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A nice looking rally car, type hatchback. Nice color scheme, good looking front of the car, with the lights and light hoods. The car is sponsored by &#39;Expodite&#39; and &#39;Octan&#39;. &#39;Airborne&#39; is only visible on the minifigs torso.</p>

<p>The doors cannot open.</p>

<p>I do not like the looks of the spoiler that much. It&#39;s just not their yet, however it is adjustable, which is nice.</p>

<p>What perhaps is missing, just a minor detail, is a start flag. We have a checkered flag for the finish line, but in the real rally cross, there is also a flag at the startline.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Value for money: Great. Hence it is a rally car, playability can be on road and off road.</p>

<p>A very detailed car with great colour scheme.</p>

<p>The grill with headlights in the front really stands out in the crowd, making this a very sporty car.</p>
