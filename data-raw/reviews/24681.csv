"cedricsagne","2016-02-19T19:04:21.917Z","Wish I could get another colour","<p>We got this new City set as a gift and it is really action packed, but TLG seems to have overlooked that races require two players.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and instructions are LEGO quality, the back features the cockpit hinge and two views, one from the front and one from the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With just 91 parts, this is a small set, but the parts are unusual, from the cockpit (92279), long slopes (13731) and the front deck (6129986 - not in inventory), as well as 47456</p>

<p>These green parts will work well with models such as Power Mech for example (31007)</p>

<p>One printed tile only, the rest are stickers. Some of the stickers are tough to apply (long narrow bricks or funny angled bricks). Applying stickers in this model is not for the intended audience, and it was challenging, requiring very careful positioning.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure is classy, with a cool design jacket and it has appeared in 10673, so now he gets his own show!</p>

<p>I like his life jacket, and I&#39;ve just discovered it comes in 35 sets, so it&#39;s more common than I thought.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is straighforward for a set this size, and the only tricky bit is for the exhaust pipes at the back, but that&#39;s sure going to bring our junior builders to explore weird angles</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is swooshable, although it does not float... so TLG, when do we get a small hull for water fun?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A decent model although it&#39;s unclear what to do with it. An alternative build as another set or a few spare (different colours) would allow races between models with different colours.</p>

<p>On its own, and with the difficult 6129986 it is impossible to mod another colour scheme for a second racer. As a result this is a one-man race or a race between two identical boats if you buy two sets (pathetic).</p>

<p>This explains the 2 in playability.</p>

"CrescentSky","2016-02-28T20:27:25.013Z","VROOOM!","<p>Of the miscellaneous&nbsp;City sets of early 2016, three sets stood out to me: 60119 Ferry, 60116 Ambulance Plane, and 60114 Race Boat. Today I&#39;ll write about the last one, 60114.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The front of the&nbsp;box shows the boat speeding down a canal, and based on the orientation of the buoys it is going out to sea. The back showcases&nbsp;different views of the boat and its driver. The instructions are nothing special, and as usual displays of other city themes are included in the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are not many parts in this set (only 95), but the ones included are very nice and somewhat uncommon. Some worth mentioning are the large&nbsp;1x10x1 black slopes and the hinged canopy piece.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The one minifigure&nbsp;in the set, a boat operator, is very nice. He is fairly simple, but the torso is only in one other set, 10673 Race Car Rally. He has plain blue lags and a blue helmet with visor. He also comes equipped with a Personal Flotation Device (PFD).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build starts with the minifigure&nbsp;and the&nbsp;two buoys. You then start building the boat from the hull up. Although there aren&#39;t very many stickers in the set, four are placed on curved surfaces, and two more are long and narrow. I didn&#39;t hve too much trouble putting them on, but some children might. The build itself isn&#39;t very complicated, but was enjoyable nonetheless.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model is very nice for displaying and sturdy enough for play. It appears that the engine on the back is an eight cylinder engine with a large intake. The hull is shaped like a combination of a pontoon and standard hull. The cockpit hinges up, and feels very realistic, while the interior has a steering wheel and a printed dashboard.&nbsp;It does not fall apart easily from normal play.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am pleased with this set. It is rather inexpensive, looks good and plays very well (although the bottom does drag&nbsp;on studded surfaces). If you or your child would like a small boat for any reason, I would definitely&nbsp;buy this set.</p>

"redbeardlegoman","2018-01-13T01:17:11.31Z","Cutting the Waves","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This is a good set.&nbsp; A great looking boat, with a beefy engine, and an awesome jacket piece.<br />
<br />
<strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The only thing on the box that really interested me was the discount sticker, so yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The only part that I am certain is unique, is the awesome lightning bolt printed jacket on the minifigure.&nbsp; More on that later</p>

<p>I like the two 1x1 technic beams (though &#39;beam&#39; is a stretch - or rather, it isn&#39;t) being used as the jet outlets.&nbsp; I enjoy a clever effect created with simple applications.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Our fearless captain is wearing a pretty smarmy expression to go with that swish jacket.</p>

<p>I love the jacket.&nbsp; I&#39;m going to bricklink at least four more of them, because the citizens of my city demand such a boss jacket, while they await the minifigure version of Ryan Gosling&#39;s silver scorpion one.</p>

<p>Until I started reading other people&#39;s reviews, I was never really bothered by the ill-fitting nature of the yellow life jacket.&nbsp; I can still kind of rationalize it along the lines of life jackets being practical, not fashionable.&nbsp; But now I can&#39;t help but be bothered by the large gap in the neck.&nbsp; I think it should be redesigned.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a very quick build.&nbsp; Which also meant that I could start vrooming it around the imaginary waves on my desk right away.&nbsp; Chicaning through the marker bouys&nbsp;with the professional disdain of the naturally talented racing ace took me way back to my six-year-old self.</p>

<p>I&#39;m normally fine with stickers, but these long thin ones are a nightmare to apply straight.&nbsp; And the tiny ones in the corner of the canopy were not fun to stick on&nbsp;either.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s nothing mind-blowing, unless you are really, really into boats, perhaps.&nbsp; But it is a good looking boat, and is different from the other ones zipping up and down my harbour.&nbsp; The motor is sufficiently beefy, and combined with the closed cockpit, it really sells the speed of this racing boat.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>To be totally honest, you could take it or pass it over.&nbsp; But I like it, and I&#39;m glad I picked it up.&nbsp; Lego City isn&#39;t exactly crowded with boats, so if you don&#39;t have one, you could do worse than this zippy fellow.</p>
