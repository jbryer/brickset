"Skut","2016-02-01T02:13:52.33Z","Eat my dust!","<p>This is a stellar City set.&nbsp; This 4x4 beast looks ready to leap straight out of the box and into the Dakar Rally.&nbsp; I think this is probably Lego&#39;s best ever rally vehicle, certainly in the City theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most impressive feature of the model is its sheer sturdiness.&nbsp; Prior to this, 6867 (Loki&#39;s Cosmic Cube Escape) was probably the sturdiest truck to come from Lego (<a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/44921"">http://brickset.com/reviews/44921)</a>.&nbsp; However this one pips it.&nbsp; Throughout the build, you can&#39;t help being impressed at how robustly this vehicle&#39;s chassis is put together.&nbsp; The finished product handles off-road driving, jumps and stunts with ease, leading to first class playability.&nbsp; Indeed I decided to test how far I could drop it without significant breakage and got to about 2 metres with no major failures.&nbsp; Brilliant!</p>

<p>The build is short and satisfying, and should be easily&nbsp;completed by kids at the lower end of the suggested age range.&nbsp; The set includes the &quot;new&quot; type of stickers, which seem to be a step up in resilience from the previous type (time will tell).&nbsp; The set features a good variety of elements, including the&nbsp;revised tool set&nbsp;with shifting spanner, a cordless drill and other useful gadgets.&nbsp; Apart from the rally vehicle itself,&nbsp;the set includes&nbsp;a fuel can, a mini desert scene (with flag and scorpion) and a useful trolley for the aforementioned tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are pretty good for a City set too; there&#39;s a new &quot;Octan&quot; pattern printed front and back on the torso of both minifigs - this is the best Octan minifig decoration since Octan was introduced around 1990.&nbsp; The leg pieces are two tone (red hips, green legs) but not printed.&nbsp; Overall they&#39;re appropriate to the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only possible improvement might be to reconfigure the cabin to accommodate two minifigs (driver plus navigator/co-driver) but this really doesn&#39;t take away from the set&#39;s appeal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In summary, this set ticks all the boxes.&nbsp; 5s all round.&nbsp; &quot;Right&nbsp;6 plus&quot; into your local Lego dealer and pick one up!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the box, and the instructions are the instructions. &nbsp;Nothing innovative or new here.<br />
<br />
What I continue to wish for, however, is that the instructions and sticker sheet would come backed with cardboard and bagged, like in some (but not all) of the larger sets. &nbsp;This is not a problem unique to this set, so I won&#39;t hold it against it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there are any new or rare parts in this set, but there are a few instances of great parts use:<br />
<br />
The use of the black curved slope as an air scoop is elegant and inspired. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t block the windscreen, and still conveys an idea with a single, cleverly-placed piece.<br />
<br />
The exhaust pipes at the back are well used and add to the powerful look of the car.</p>

<p>The yellow shock absorbers are an improvement on a similar idea used in 60055 - Monster Truck.<br />
<br />
The rack around the spare tire is&nbsp;reminiscent of the roll cage in 76030 - Avengers Hydra Showdown. &nbsp;I like it. &nbsp;It&#39;s a touch that adds to the authenticity of the model.<br />
<br />
Finally, although not new in this set, this is my first with the expanded tool set. &nbsp;I love the adjustable wrench, power drill, ratchet wrench and four-way lug wrench.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures look excellent. &nbsp;The racing jackets have a delightfully modern design, with the oversized text and logo, at a slanted angle. &nbsp;TLG is doing more and more to add these fashionable design concepts that, while may ultimately date the models, will also likely bring a real nostalgia to us&nbsp;collectors in the future.<br />
<br />
I am also continually happy to see the inclusion of more and more female heads into these sets. &nbsp;It&#39;s long been no real problem to put a woman&#39;s head on a minifigure, and thereby further crumble traditional gender roles. &nbsp;But, it&#39;s also very nice for my daughter to build models with me, with an increased abundance of female heads, and the lessened implied men/women role dichotomy.<br />
<br />
My daughter simply put the helmet on the lady, and made her the driver, as opposed to what&#39;s on the box. &nbsp;And I am happy that she didn&#39;t think twice about it.<br />
<br />
If there were one thing I would change, and even be willing to pay just a little bit more for, would be that all minifigures that come with helmets also come with a hair piece, for when they aren&#39;t wearing hats.<br />
<br />
But then, there&#39;s always Bricklink for that, too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build isn&#39;t exactly challenging, but that&#39;s not unexpected for a mid-range model in the City line. &nbsp;But, it is a solid build. &nbsp;Sometimes builds can be fragile, with tricky steps that often can be built better with a different approach. &nbsp;7685 - Dozer immediately comes to mind, with it&#39;s fragile&nbsp;hydraulics and cabin.<br />
<br />
I do feel, however, that two bags are unnecessary for the build. &nbsp;I would have had it in only one bag.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This durable rally car almost looks like it could win the real Dakar Rally. &nbsp;A spare tire on the back is a great touch that adds a lot of realism and automatic playability. &nbsp;It also puts the new tools to great use.<br />
<br />
And that darling tool cart screams &quot;Snap On Tools&quot; doesn&#39;t it?<br />
<br />
The great design approach on the jackets also applies to the stickers, giving them a more contemporary design touch, and added realism. &nbsp;The same approach can be seen on 60081 - Pickup Tow Truck (a surprise favourite) and the previously mentioned 60055 - Monster Truck.<br />
<br />
Speaking of 60055, I do find it hilarious that this rally truck is much beefier and bigger than the monster truck. &nbsp;It makes me want to rebuild 60055 on the same kind of scale.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not entirely sure how I feel about the tiny (oh so tiny) dessert scene that comes with it. &nbsp;Would more rally car paraphernalia have been better? &nbsp;A little tent for working in the soothing shade while out in the Sahara? &nbsp;Then again, I get a little scorpion, so there&#39;s that.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is probably one of the best off road vehicles I&#39;ve seen for a City set. &nbsp;It&#39;s certainly the best looking rally car - with champion writ large all over it. &nbsp;It&#39;s got the full compliment of tools on a delightful cart, a spare tire for instant play beyond simply driving, a female driver, and great looking graphic design. &nbsp;This set is true value for money, and you&#39;d be foolish not to pick it up.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2017-05-06T06:53:22.363Z","Make way!","<p>Released in 2016 for the City line LEGO gives us a very very big off-road truck. Is this vehicle worth considering? Let&#39;s read on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>We get a very attractive cover and back cover of our vehicle in a rugged environment. The colors certainly pop and it does have an official racing vehicle air about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we get a manual, a sheet of stickers, and two bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We don&#39;t get many unique parts here but we do get a full set of tools to upkeep our vehicle and a cart that will comfortably accommodate them all. We get a scorpion in black but by far the minifigure torsos are quite the catch with this set. They have the Octan branding printed front and back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are your spare parts when you complete this model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4174/34438807296_9f79aa376b.jpg[/img]</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure/s:</strong></p>

<p>We get two identical minifigures(minus their gender, of course)&nbsp;here but they are both great to have. They have the Octan colors and logo on their torsos and even their legs and hip pieces get in on the act. I appreciate the variety here since we usually get a single&nbsp;color&nbsp;for the hips and legs in the City line, in this case these are separate colors.</p>

<p>Also, thankfully, their torsos are not gender specific so you can swap these about with any number of other minifigure heads and make Octan staff of your own later should you wish.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also get a scorpion&nbsp;thrown in the mix which will be useful for original creations or other modifications.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build and Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The build was pretty simple but I liked the fact that the entire vehicle is brick built. There is no specialized under-carriage piece here.</p>

<p>There are a few side assemblies too, such as the small bit of terrain with the Octan marker flag on it and the tool kit for our pit-crew as well as a barrel of Octan&nbsp;regular, or perhaps it holds diesel. Either way I appreciate their inclusion as again it opens up possibilities to expanding other City scenes you own or can help start you on your way to modifying other builds later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicle itself is BIG as you will see from my included pictures. The use of the larger style of tires really helps this thing look like an aggressive piece of Octan engineering. The color schemes look true to the in-universe brand and the sticker detailing is optional but adds a great sense of cohesion to the entire set. Thankfully these are easy to apply since they are not transparent and are relatively large.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interior is very roomy but sadly, given its design it can only hold one figure. I also like the addition of the roll&nbsp;cage and the spare tire on the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This monster is ready to roll over anything!</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>I have to say I like this set. It reminds me slightly of the police off-roader&nbsp;we get for the Crook&#39;s Hideout in the Swamp Police line not long ago. The thing looks tough and ready to tumble and actually it tumbles well. Those huge tires go a long way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you do not yet have a large style of truck in your City then I would certainly recommend this to you. The bright colors do inspire racing and the size certainly inspires stunt play. Thankfully the build is tough and sturdy and will hold up to a few bumps here and there. The included figures are also great to have for those nice Octan&nbsp;prints as well. Your or any City fan will be delighted with this model. The only minus is that despite the truck&#39;s&nbsp;size it can only hold a single figure.&nbsp;</p>
