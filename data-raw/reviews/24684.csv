"MGDawson","2016-01-02T11:10:04.39Z","The camping line continues!","<p>The last time I brought something relating to camping from Lego was the Camper (7639)&nbsp;from 2009. How does this iteration hold up?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was extremely compact as per most sets of late, with little air space in the box. With the removal of the van&#39;s mirrors, both items fit in the box easily.</p>

<p>The instructions (two books, one per vehicle)&nbsp;were easy to follow with no issues.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing really stood out for me as being rare or unique parts wise, except for maybe the colouring of some parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figures presented are a nice variation to standard fare, especially the female figure, whos&nbsp;hairpiece and torso stand her out from other figures in the city line.</p>

<p>While in this section, I should mention the doggy - who even comes with his own bone to chew. Or maybe it&#39;s hoping to steal one of the sausages?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build went together easily and quickly, with no major issues (except when I forgot to put a piece in the van).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There are a few niggles with the design, IMHO. Nothing to stop you buying the set per se, but issues I found distracting.</p>

<p>First, there is the area around the front bumper of the van. The front indicators should really be cheese slopes to match the headlights, it seems strange to utilize the 1x1 plates for this. The gap behind the bumper and the front wheels seems odd too, which unfortunately is only fixable if the bonnet is brought forward a stud.</p>

<p>Second, the caravan. There&#39;s a bed, and a coffee machine. No sink, cookware or other facilities are available - including toilets! There&#39;s also no TV or other facilities so the &#39;figs must either have bad hygiene or they&#39;re only out in their caravan temporarily. Speaking of the bed, good luck trying to get both figs in properly and lying down, it&#39;s only 4 wide and the walls are solid bricks, not recessed panels.</p>

<p>The caravan also seems to be inspired by/is based on&nbsp;4435&#39;s caravan. Not necessarily a bad thing, but considering they&#39;re supposed to be different makes...</p>

<p>Also the choice of a 1x1 round tile in grey for the roof where the side moves over to attach to seems weird. Why not use a 1x1 smooth tile?</p>

<p>Bad points out the way, what about the positives?</p>

<p>The van has capacity for both figures AND their dog, plus any luggage (no suitcases&nbsp;included, except for the stove, sausages and dog bone).</p>

<p>The van is unlike most of the vehicles in city, and both it and the caravan have excellent proportions - no wheels stick out and&nbsp;everything is to scale with each other. The removable ceiling/roof and side panel are excellently executed, and there&#39;s plenty of room for people like me to get my hands in to place figures in properly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As one of only two sets that I&#39;ve been interested in this year from the City line, I am definitely pleased with my purchase, though I&#39;ll be looking to upgrade/modify the caravan at a later date with more features (especially a toilet and washbasin!)</p>

The set uses fun, bright, primary colors, has a few nice details (the grill, and the dog), and is a very good looking design for both the van and the camper. I especially like the camper with its foldout door, though it does lack some interior detail. However, this is a value set (I paid only $20 at Target US) and for the money the set has a lot of playability.</p>

<p>Very easy to put together (in fact this was probably the easiest set I&#39;ve every assembled), looks great, and compliments other LEGO sets very nicely.&nbsp;</p>

"Sobel","2016-10-06T17:35:38.857Z","Another great camping mobile!","<p>First off, I have been a friend of camping and caravaning my whole life! So it was clear, I had to buy the 60057 Camper Van last year, and now this little beauty also immediately caught my attention. So I sneaked it in the online shopping cart while buying some minifigures for my daughter when my wife wasn&#39;t looking! ;-)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a standard-sized LEGO box. Always nice to hold in hands when new, shiny and sealed!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing spectacular here. Just the typical parts for LEGO vehicles like tires, windows, mudguards and so on. You get a bone for the dog and some coffee and sausages (must be Brits) for the LEGO people.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No surprises here either. Basic, fitting perfectly into the image of peace-seeking caravaners. A guy, a girl and their dog on a peaceful vacation! What could be more relaxing?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Due to the rather small number of parts and the simple instructions, the build holds no challenge. It&#39;s very straightforward, building both the van and the trailer from bottom to the top.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The van is a sturdy vehicle wih big windows in the back, so the passengers can marvel at the countryside. It even has a special place to put the dog in, so it doesn&#39;t go loose in the car (OK, moves a bit from left to right, oh welllll...).<br />
The trailer has a bed (just like the 60057 model), a place to sit down, a coffee machine and a cup holder. Additionally, the set features a barbecue grill with &quot;glowing coal&quot; and two sausages. I think there should have been a better solution for where to put the grill while driving, but well, I guess you can&#39;t have everything, no?<br />
The trailer has a big hatch you can open to the side, so you can access the interior and place the minifigures.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Oh, the details! I love them!! A coffee machine! A barbecue grill! The cuddly interior of the trailer! This set has everything an old camper would need! There no great functions, but hey, if you have imagination, there are infinite holidays waiting for you!<br />
And who wouldn&#39;t like to go camping with friends? So go and grab the 60057 Camping Caravan, too!!</p>

"andyh1984","2016-08-18T18:10:18.34Z","All-round nice set","<p>I bought this on an impulse in the toyshop as I am going to get 31052 Vacation Getaways and thought they will go well together.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard city box showing model and play features</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of blue and white parts and tinted windows</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>&nbsp;A male in a dark blue square pattern&nbsp;shirt with red lines and grey trousers,&nbsp;and a female with a green jacket over a pale blue top with light tan trousers, she has the hairpiece which any Lego Star Wars collectors will recognise&nbsp;from Obi-Wan Kenobi&nbsp;in 75021 Republic Gunship, This is the first time I have had a female with this hairpiece and it looks different. There is also a brown dog with dark brown and black printing on his muzzle/snout/nose.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Essentially 2 builds the grill/bbq and&nbsp;the car are&nbsp;built first and it is a larger off-road type vehicle but with normal wheels and ground clearance. The caravan has a hinged section so you can get inside.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The car unusually fits 2 minifigures&nbsp;(one behind the other) and the dog, I was expecting one fig and the dog to have to travel in the caravan and&nbsp;probably&nbsp;this is the reason for the larger car. The caravan is outfitted with a bed and a coffee machine, and the grill can be stored on the roof, a 1x2 tile with a lip (probably not the actual piece name) on the edge of the roof&nbsp;stops the hinged section from opening.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like this set, it has playability and will fit into a city street theme&nbsp;or an outdoors theme.&nbsp;</p>

"danbailey","2016-09-30T16:12:45.14Z","Good Family Fun","<p>This is one of the more fun kits I&#39;ve purchased for myself. &nbsp;Lately, I&#39;ve been focused on bigger sets and chasing down Series 16 minifigs, but with this on sale at Target, the price was right and I went for it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As an AFOL who&#39;d been out of the hobby since the mid-1990&#39;s (I was an AFOL then, too), one of the things I&#39;ve had issues with since returning to the hobby in 2015 is the multiple instruction books, and all the **** stickers. &nbsp;This kit has two books, which I&#39;m okay with -- it&#39;s split in such a way that book one covers the SUV and the grill, and book two is for the trailer. &nbsp;Fortunately, there&#39;s not a ton of stickers in this set, like there are in others (I&#39;m looking at <em>you</em>, Avengers Tower).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Great assortment. &nbsp;I feel like I could build multiple varieties of cars or different campers&nbsp;out of the pieces included, as there&#39;s a great mix of structural pieces and smaller/automotive pieces. &nbsp;I don&#39;t get this feeling with some other sets I&#39;ve purchase, like the Speed Champions series. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>They look like they just walked out of an REI.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fun! &nbsp;Simple enough where I was able to collaborate with it on my four year-old and he didn&#39;t have any problem following along, but I wasn&#39;t bored, either. &nbsp;With the multi-stage build, we were able to hand the SUV to his little brother (two and a half) to play with while we built the trailer together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like it! &nbsp;It&#39;ll probably end up doing some time on my desk at the office. &nbsp;My kids love it, and as our only point of friction during the whole thing, they argued over who got to play with it before bed time. &nbsp;(Hint: both of you do, stop fighting.) &nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, there&#39;s room for both people in each vehicle, the coffeepot in the trailer is a really nice touch, and I liked the storage for the grill inside the SUV. &nbsp;Little details like the hot coals (trans orange 1x1 round tiles) really made the model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Definitely worth spending the money on. &nbsp;If you&#39;re a big fan of City, this is a should-have.</p>

"lentil","2017-01-03T21:03:24.043Z","Great little set for the money!","<p>I think this set is a great example of what LEGO can do with a good designer and relatively small number of essentially simple bricks. Classic LEGO excellence!</p>

<p>The set contains two vehicles: a towing vehicle (van) and a camper-trailer (caravan). The design of both is quite nice - the van looks like a rugged off-roader in bright blue with grey stripes, is nicely tiled giving it a smooth but chunky shape, and has well-placed, simple details like trans elements representing lights, and 1x1 plates for rear-view mirrors. The camper has a snazzy retro look with its green horizontal stripe at the base and goofy mountain stickers. I&#39;m a big sucker for those smoky tinted windows and this set has them in spades - especially love the giant windows on either side of the camper which give a good view of the interior (not much privacy for those attempting to nap in there though!). There are a total of 3 tinted windshields, 6 small windows, and 2 large ones in the set altogether which is a pretty good haul for a small set.</p>

<p>The doors of the van open, although it is difficult to get the figs through this opening which is a bit narrow. Fortunately the roof panels are easy to remove and the back of the van is quite roomy for multiple passengers and/or cargo. I especially like how one side of the camper swings open to reveal complete access to the interior. This is a great play feature! The camper is pretty small inside and does not have too many details (bed, seat, coffee maker), but again for the small amount a bricks involved this is an ingenious little number.</p>

<p>It comes with only two minifigs and a dog, but room enough inside for additional friends and neighbors to go along for the ride if you so choose.</p>

<p>My 10-year old daughter enjoys this set and uses it to transport the inhabitants of her LEGO world back and forth from their city houses to their vacation homes, such as the Lakeside Lodge and Seaside House. It makes a perfect companion to the Creator houses despite being in the City line.</p>

<p>Overall I think this little set is a hidden gem and consider it incredible value for the money, even at full/regular price - if discounted it of course becomes a downright steal! It&#39;s one thing to create a wonderful set using a 4000 piece count, 32 colors, and all sorts of different pieces... another ball game entirely to come up with something good in a small package and low price point, with just simple parts and techniques. Kudos to LEGO for producing great sets in a variety of ranges.</p>

You can fit everybody inside, there&rsquo;s space for two Minifigures and one canine companion in the back. The colour scheme really pops on this model and I love the look of it.

They make great additional vehicles to display alongside other sets of a camping Theme, such as the LEGO Creator cabin set from a few years ago, or the new larger RV inspired set.
