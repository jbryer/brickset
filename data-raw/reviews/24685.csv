<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typical bright colors, play features on the back, and 2 simple (maybe too simple?) instructions&nbsp;corresponding to 3 numbered bags (Book 1 for Bags 1 &amp; 2; Book 2 for Bag 3).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A few useful Technic&nbsp;pieces as well as a bunch of flat orange pieces used for the repository on the back of the truck. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 rather standard workers, one in blue detailed top with grey pants, and one guy with orange overalls. &nbsp;They come with a shovel and a broom.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy, fun build. &nbsp;Some familiar&nbsp;aspects from previous City vehicles, as well as a couple of Technic pieces. &nbsp;A few decals which is also standard these days and I don&#39;t mind.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Excellent. &nbsp;Six studs wide without mirrors/wheels. &nbsp;Also a dual-rear axle which gives the truck some ruggedness. &nbsp;This (back wheels)&nbsp;however is the poorest area of the model with little detail and some random colors showing.</p>

<p>The little garbage bin with &quot;waste&quot; looks great and can be used separately from the truck in your City world. Also note that it fits perfectly into the back of the truck. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I personally like the playability that comes with some Technic pieces in my City sets. &nbsp;With this truck you get both the traditional tilt feature with opening back, as well as the &quot;arms&quot; to lift and dump the smaller receptacle. &nbsp;As noted however, there is no way to retract the technic arms so you have to drive with them sticking out or up. The cab only holds one figure, right in the middle, which is pretty standard. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>To me, sets like this are the bread and butter of the City line - civic vehicles and the folks who work with them. &nbsp;At 248 pieces and two fun minifigs,&nbsp;you cannot go wrong at this price point. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t want to build it, then&nbsp;just throw it in the closet - it&#39;ll never be worth less than $20.&nbsp;</p>

"Skut","2016-01-29T02:21:39.097Z","A garbage truck that is far from rubbish","<p>Another strong City offering in the Traffic/Great Vehicles series.&nbsp; The Lego designers who have brought us these super models, for over 5 years now, deserve a pat on the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This garbage truck is a case in point.&nbsp; It&#39;s not perfect (see below), but it&#39;s a commendable first attempt at a front-loading refuse vehicle.&nbsp; Garbage trucks in the City (and formerly Town) line go all the way back to 6693 in 1997, but tend to be rear-loading residential models. This type of front-loading commercial waste vehicle is widely seen in any city, so it&#39;s a great subject for a Lego model.</p>

<p>The building experience is entertaining, combining a reasonably strong chassis with a solid rear tipping/emptying mechanism.&nbsp; All these&nbsp;parts of the model&nbsp;are brick built and, in the that sense, &quot;conventional&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast,&nbsp;the (front) bin loading mechanism is constructed from Technic axles and joiners and provides a welcome contrast from the traditional elements of the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are not a lot of elements you wouldn&#39;t expect in a set of this type - have a look at the picture and it&#39;s pretty much &quot;what you see is what you get&quot;.&nbsp; The contents of the rubbish bin/skip include a couple of fish, a bottle and a banana, but apart from that consist of 1x1 round plates (*yawn* - a 1x1 wedge or tile or two would have been nice).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The finished product is generally satisfying both visually and play-wise, subject to the reservations below.&nbsp; The rear truck emptying mechanism is first class, however the front rubbish collection mechanism is lacking in both playability and realism.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the truck&#39;s rubbish collection&nbsp;container (the orange bit) does not protrude far enough over the cab (as in real trucks of this type), so attempting to load often results in&nbsp;rubbish being emptied all over the truck and surrounding road as well as into the truck.&nbsp; The front&nbsp;fork design, whilst functional in that it raises the bin, does not allow the tines to fold upwards when they&#39;re not being used.&nbsp; This means you can either drive the truck around between jobs with the fork lowered (as depicted on the back of the box), or raise the fork and leave then sticking skywards far above the height of the rest of the truck.&nbsp; Neither option is very satisfactory, either play-wise or realism-wise.&nbsp; Folding tines and a longer&nbsp;rubbish container&nbsp;overhang would add to both playability and realism.&nbsp; The strobe lights and one of the minifigs could have been sacrificed to enable the additional piece cost of including these modifications&nbsp;in the design.&nbsp; As it is, you&#39;ll have to MOC it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with most City sets, this one contains stickers.&nbsp; Congratulations to Lego on listening to feedback and changing the sticker material.&nbsp; The new stickers appear to feature a more heavily laminated surface which, hopefully, will prove more resistant to cracking and peeling.&nbsp; One word of warning though: this laminated surface crinkles easily so you need to get the sticker application right first time, or else face a very ticklish challenge to remove the stickers without damaging them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the minifigs, the two sanitation engineers included in the set are very much standard City fare.&nbsp;City is not exactly renowned for its minifigs (although 60134 Fun at the Park may change that) and this set is no exception.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price is pitched at the usual point for Great Vehicles sets and the contents of this set feel about right&nbsp;in comparison with other sets at the same price point.&nbsp; Of course all Lego fans want Lego to cost less, but to love Lego is to appreciate quality and I guess that comes at a price.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>So, in summary, a great set and well worth picking up, but get ready to use your creativity to improve that front loading mechanism.&nbsp;</p>

"andyh1984","2016-08-18T17:20:56.993Z","A good set but could have been a bit better","<p>This is a nice set and I am very happy with it but there are a couple of things that could be better</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard city box showing model and play features</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It is mostly brick built with quite a few orange pieces and&nbsp;some technic in the lift mechanism.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 pretty standard garbage men but the one with orange overalls the colour&nbsp;is darker on his torso</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Nothing too taxing and&nbsp;lots of different pieces mean its not too repetitive.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks great but a few&nbsp;things stop it getting a perfect score:</p>

<p>The skip is too shallow and when you lift it using the forks pieces fall out before it is in position over the truck leaving you finding 1x1&nbsp;studs rolling around the floor.</p>

<p>The forks are fixed in position so you &quot;travel&quot; with them either sticking out in front or lifted up and sticking in the air, although I can&#39;t think of a foldable alternative without&nbsp;severely bulking out the mechanism.</p>

<p>Nowhere for the second fig to either sit or even hold on to the side when travelling.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set even with the above taken into account and I am happy I bought it.</p>

"auriga","2016-06-30T13:36:38.363Z","A worthy update to the City garbage truck","<p>This is my first review&nbsp;so please bear with me.</p>

<p>The first and&nbsp;last garbage truck I ever owned and played with is the 6693 Refuse Collection Truck. I have fond memories of that set (it unfortunately got Kragled&nbsp;by my father...), so when I got out of my dark ages I immediately wanted to see how the latest incarnation of the garbage truck compares. Does this set meet my expectations? Read on to find out.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a box that is taped shut&nbsp;so it can be opened without tearing the box open, so box collectors&nbsp;will be pleased (I don&#39;t collect boxes, so shoot me). The boxart is typical City fare, with the front showing a general view of the set and the back showing vignettes depicting its playability.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Open the box and you will find two instruction booklets, three numbered bags, and a small white sticker sheet. Some may find the sticker sheet to be interesting as some labels are cut to size rather than spanning entire surfaces of parts; I honestly found these smaller stickers easier to position than their larger counterparts.</p>

<p>The parts are typical of a City truck set, with some Technic pieces thrown in for&nbsp;the fork. You also get interesting parts to simulate garbage: a banana, two fish, and a bottle (someone clearly does not know how to segregate!). Perhaps most notable is the use of orange parts which are sure to pop even in a display dominated by fire sets. I personally like the orange parts as I entered my dark ages before Lego introduced the color. Some green is also used for the garbage bin, and I find that this contrasts nicely with the white and orange parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two minifigures&nbsp;aren&#39;t really special. One has a blue shirt under orange overalls with a reflective silver stripe, dark stone&nbsp;gray gloves and a really simple and bare smiling face; the other has sand blue pants, a blue jacket with two orange stripes, and a face with dark orange facial hair and a cocky smile. Both minifigures&nbsp;come with blue baseball caps and no printing on the backs of their torsos.</p>

<p>My only complaint about the minifigures is the orange printed on the blue torsos; as one would expect the orange looks dull&nbsp;and therefore looks closer to brown. This effect can really be seen on the one with orange overalls -&nbsp;especially when it is paired with the supplied orange legs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is separated between&nbsp;two instruction booklets. Booklet one deals with bags 1 and 2, which finishes&nbsp;the minifigures and garbage bin and the cab and bed of the truck, respectively; booklet three covers bag 3, which finishes the tipper, fork, and wheels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build should not take long or be anything special to someone used to building modern Lego trucks. The fork does use Technic, but the mechanism is very straightforward that I doubt a child would have any problems (then again, I built&nbsp;Technic by myself when I was 7).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What a nice truck! As I expected, the white cab, orange tipper, and green bin contrast really nicely. The results are satisfying despite the typical City truck build. I especially like the friction on the tipper and door; I vividly remember how the mechanism on 6693 was very loose (the door opened with gravity as you raised the tipper, and the tipper itself was floppy), so it&#39;s nice to have a tipper mechanism that you can display without worrying that it will gradually sag back to the truck&nbsp;bed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set isn&#39;t without faults, though. First, I feel that the bin is too low compared to the minifigures; this also causes its contents to sometimes spill out prematurely when using the fork. Second, while I do love the orange pieces these unfortunately cause the trans orange pieces on top of the tipper to not stand out; I will concede that these look better in person (they hardly look transparent in pictures)&nbsp;and that I can&#39;t think of a different color to simulate the warning lights. Third, the truck lacks provisions for the&nbsp;second minifigure; there&#39;s no seat or even a bar to grab on while the truck is in transit so the poor guy has no choice but to walk.</p>

<p>My major complaint about this set is the fork itself. First of all, while the set integrates the Technic pieces better than other sets these still look out of place compared to the rest of the model; I can, however, let this slide as I can&#39;t think of a better way to build the fork mechanism (the one used in 7599 Garbage Truck Getaway uses Technic beams and thus looks unreasonable bulky, IMO). Second -&nbsp;and probably my biggest complaint -&nbsp;is how the fork connects to the truck. The fork connects via two 18641 Cross axle 2m w. snap with friction which are able to rotate independently of each other; this causes the fork to lose rigidity when carrying the bin, and thus there is noticeable backlash between the two prongs (the left one tends to move first as it is closer to where the torque is applied). Kids probably will not mind&nbsp;but adults might wonder why a single solid Technic axle wasn&#39;t used in the first place; you may argue that a single axle would come at the cost of friction, but whatever friction the current system may have is rendered useless when under load.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I may have written more about this set&#39;s flaws&nbsp;but I still feel that this is a solid set and a worthy update to the mandatory City garbage truck. It has a simple and typical build that yields satisfying results, nice colors, two minifigures which are always nice for City building,&nbsp;and a play feature that, though could have been better, is nice to have. Price-wise I think this is a reasonably-valued set, especially if you live somewhere Lego is cheap (which I don&#39;t;&nbsp;I paid close to double the US price but that is par for course when buying Lego here in the Philippines).&nbsp;I definitely do not regret having this set as one of my first City sets since coming out of my dark ages.</p>

"Kcko","2016-11-26T19:09:02.783Z","First LEGO set I bought today for my younger son (2,7y)","<p>It was clear to buy exactly this set - I mean garbage truck - for my younger son Proki. He has plenty of various garbage trucks and he knows how all garbage trucks work all around the world :-) &nbsp;(youtube source...)</p>

<p>It was build by his older brother Kamka except container. Very convenient and clear for 8Y old guy. No extra comment to parts. Both&nbsp;were excited. Two minifigs - driver and his helper give them opportunity not to fight but play together. Works perfectly but when emptying the container some parts are falling outside the garbage truck - no one cares... it means need to be loaded again and emptied again :-) &nbsp; thats good.</p>

<p>Cool set and the best choice for my garbage expert Proki</p>
