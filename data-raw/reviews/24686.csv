<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Comes in a fairly typical medium/small box with pictures showing multiple angles and the play features. &nbsp;Instructions come in three packets, one for the red car and two minifigures, and the other two dedicated to the actual Ferry. &nbsp;In the box you will find four sets of numbered bags. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a number of interesting pieces here, the bridge in particular contains a lot of moderately interesting pieces, including the two angled supports, the two sets of four pane glass bridge windows with angled ends, the two sloped black roof pieces and the roof antenna are all nice to find, although more&nbsp;common in 2016 with the various maritime themes in the Police and Fire themes. &nbsp;Last of all, the floor of the ferry has the two large green smooth plates and the grate in the center that are of interest. &nbsp;You get two minifigs, the captain and a business woman with cell phone. &nbsp;You get a small sheet of stickers with the hull numbers, license plates for the car, the City Seaways markings and the &quot;STOP&quot; warnings by the loading ramps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is nothing too exciting, the car is of the same awkward&nbsp;4 stud wide construction used in many city sets and is completely plain. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The ferry itself uses hinged sections to create the angled sides and&nbsp;fairly simple loading ramps with slope ends to provide a smooth transition for driving cars on and off. &nbsp;The bridge is simple with two steering wheels for operation in either direction and an two stud wide opening for a door. &nbsp;No stairs or ladder for access. &nbsp;There is a single chair under the bridge for a passenger to sit on and there are four bumpers around the outside of the hull that add detail texture to the hull. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The model has pretty basic play features and a fairly simple design, but its such a unique subject matter that ties in so well with many of the other sets that it stands out on this strength alone. &nbsp;The set is surprisingly large, its nice that it comes with a vehicle, even if it is one of the dreaded four stud wide cars and is reasonably detailed and attractive. &nbsp;Its a great way to provide transport for city vehicles, add&nbsp;some new visual appeal in a harbor scene (other then hoards of police and fire boats) and give a much needed expansion of subject matter for City theme! &nbsp;And all for a very reasonable price ($29.99) for a fairly large boat, a car and two mini figs.</p>

"weirdbricks","2016-01-25T16:56:04.047Z","Super job!! but but...","<p>Love this set! When i first saw it i thought is this going to be a 50$ set?? And the answer was no!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has a nice look, and love the front, where the ferry arrive with the awesome background!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts in this set was great! Not more to say...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures in this set are very good! Love that the buisness woman has black widows hair. The captain has a very plain look, but does the job very well. I think they just could have included one more random passenger?? (my thoughts).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me around 1-1,5 hour(not so fast i can!) The build is also very plain, but what can we expect...?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>finished this set looks awesome! A great addition to a city or layout. This ferry looks very much like the real ferries. The thing i hate with this set is the car! So boring and just looks like all lego city cars; terrible job wit the car.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Just AWESOME!! One of my top 10 favourite sets!</p>

"PeteM","2016-05-31T16:53:23.61Z","It's Nice, It's Different, It's Unusual...","<p>As I said in the intro to my review of 60073, I don&#39;t usually buy City sets, for reasons of budget availability and related marital harmony. However, every so often, a set a little out of the ordinary comes along and I find myself setting a mental &#39;discount target&#39; at which I can justify the purchase - and fortunately a local supermarket obliged recently by marking this down under my self-appointed threshold.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a fairly long affair &ndash; probably dictated by needing to fit the larger pieces in but, as a side effect, it can also contain the ferry when assembled (with the cabin removed and tucked down the side). The front artwork gives a good overview shot of the ferry at the dock unloading the car, a box-out illustrating the 34cm length of the ship, and the words &lsquo;boat does not float&rsquo; which can be taken as either a warning or a dare... The back has box-outs containing a little pictorial narrative of the ferry in action.</p>

<p>The recent economy of numerous instruction booklets has not made its way to the City range yet as there are three to be found in this set &ndash; the first for the car and the second and third for the ferry itself. These are as clear and straightforward as usual &ndash; I don&rsquo;t think more than three pieces are ever placed per step. I did like the diorama at the end of the second booklet featuring a port setting in which, rather dramatically, almost everything from the lighthouse to the dockside hot dog stand (?!) is on fire in order to advertise the latest Lego fire-fighting sets available.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As could be expected for a relatively small City set there is nothing too unusual in the parts selection &ndash; this will never be a &lsquo;parts pack&rsquo; &ndash; but there are still a few pieces of interest:</p>

<p>The large 16x16 plate has a variety of uses (primarily as a good sized building base), and the thin 12 stud long wedge plates are always welcome for anyone who buys a set and instantly tries to work out how to make a spaceship out of it. There are two 8x16 tiles, used widely elsewhere but appear here in green for the first time, and you also get a generous 15 white boat studs for maximum simulated boat floating.</p>

<p>There is only one printed piece, a 2x1 tile with a modern mobile phone design. Any further visual details come from a sheet of stickers, though these are minimal (used only for signage) and work well where they are utilised. I received two sets in mine &ndash; truly a day to remember.</p>

<p>The curved window pieces which make up the cabin of the ship are effective and feature clip-in glass &ndash; however, despite being labelled as a &lsquo;train front&rsquo; in the parts data base, the part has only been used as such once in its four outings so far&hellip;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two minifigs included, the captain of the ship and a lady passenger. The former sports a torso with appropriately nautical anchor printing on his jacket, introduced in last years Deep Sea Explorers theme and only used for the second time here. The lady has a smart jacket and purple necktie printing &ndash; both her and the captain have plain unprinted legs in white and dark grey respectively. If this seems too conventional, there is of course nothing to stop you swapping the heads around to produce a female captain and a man who is secure in both his bold hairstyle and vivid choice of attire.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The car is extremely basic and brings to mind those found in the 1980s Town sets. Based on a one-piece chassis, the front and rear bumpers use slightly different construction for a bit of variety but the rest of the detailing is minimal. Only four studs wide, the large wheel arches and chunky wheels nevertheless make it seem more substantial. Apart from applying the tiny number plate stickers, this would be a fairly satisfying build for many below the lower age demographic on the box guidance.</p>

<p>The ferry itself is also not difficult and, though it features little of interest for a seasoned AFOL, there are still some interesting sections for younger builders. The bottom of the ship uses the largest plates supplied to create a long octagonal base &ndash; the use of hinges and bricks to create small lengths &lsquo;off-the-grid&rsquo; sections for the front and back of the hull is interesting and shows off how flexible the Lego &lsquo;system&rsquo; can be as the diagonal hull sections mirror perfectly the angle of the wedge plate underneath. There is some necessary repetition in a ship that is mostly symmetrical, but these sub-builds are small and the whole build is so quick that it never becomes boring.</p>

<p>The use of the collectible minifig base in grey to hold the cabin on is interesting &ndash; it&rsquo;s use doesn&rsquo;t appear to be dictated by a play function, but it feels like it should be as it makes the cabin easier to remove than if a standard connection method was used.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final result is surprisingly large and looks pretty good. The entrance and exit points to the deck are a generous eight studs wide, with the hull widening to 10 useable studs in the midsection. It looks fairly roomy, though you wouldn&rsquo;t fit more than three basic City vehicles in here unless you pack it full of people in #<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/3177-1/Small-Car"">3177</a>s on their way to a SmartCar convention. The colour scheme is pleasantly jaunty, making good use of bright yellow pieces for the hull which contrast nicely with the green deck and white superstructure. Similarly the red car stands out nicely against the main model, though is more a prop to facilitate play rather than a feature in and of itself and the basic construction approach does&nbsp;mean&nbsp;that the ground clearance on the car isn&#39;t really sufficient for it to easily roll on and off the ferry.</p>

<p>There are a couple of flaws in the ferry design too - there are no steps up to the cabin and, even if there were, a minifig can&#39;t fit through the low doorway anyway. &nbsp;None of these particularly affect the play value for an imaginative child, even though the captain looks a little awkward precariously hanging half way out of the cab...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A palpable hit for the City theme, this is one of the more unusual sets from the line recently and, as such, stands out amidst the stream of road-based service lorries and various emergency vehicles (the temptation to add a helicopter to the set has been wisely resisted!). The shape, silhouette and overall look of the model, with the single cabin raised up one side, is instantly familiar to anyone who has had to wait patiently for one of these on their way to the seaside (for me it&rsquo;s the Dartmouth ferry in Devon). Though the actual build experience offers little of excitement for older builders, the target demographic will find much to entertain themselves, and the final result is a definite winner no matter whether it is being used for play or display.</p>

"tomalphin","2017-03-18T07:16:39.503Z","A great model at a lower price point","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price per part has become a common yardstick when looking at the &quot;value&quot; of a LEGO set, but we all know that not all parts are equal. &nbsp;It&#39;s also true that not all sets are equal. &nbsp;It is in this context that I review #60119: Ferry, which has 301 pieces and an 29,99$ MSRP. (For a fairly typical 0.10$ per piece.)</p>

<p><strong>Initial Impressions: </strong>When this set was initially announced, I was excited for two reasons:</p>

<p>1) Living in the Pacific Northwest, taking the ferry is a common part of weekend trips and longer vacations, so I knew that this has extra appeal where I live. &nbsp;</p>

<p>2) It&#39;s an impressively large model for 30$, containing two&nbsp;minifigures, a car, a boat and several play features.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong>&nbsp;I will admit that my building experience was not conventional &mdash; this set was the model used in the &quot;build in a bag&quot; contest at Bricks Cascade, the LEGO convention held every March in Portland, Oregon. &nbsp;Because the model contains several bags, they had us dump all of the parts into a large 2-gallon bag. &nbsp;Naturally, building the model within a large bag slows the process down and adds some frustration along the way.</p>

<p>Building the model inside a bag also made the model&#39;s relatively large size incredibly clear - The model&#39;s full length barely fits in a really large 2 gallon bag! &nbsp;As for the model itself, the car is extremely basic, which I appreciate since it allowed them to focus on the boat, and focus on keeping the price low. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability:&nbsp;</strong>As for the boat, I really appreciated the smaller details, like consistent use of Red/green lighting on either side of the boat, and the way in which the three sections of the&nbsp;boat deck are assembled, which is simple but pretty sturdy too. &nbsp;The bridge is simple, but well designed with playability in mind - the bridge can be removed easily without breaking the model, and the roof can be removed as well to put a minifigure inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the ferry reaches the other side, you can lower the front ramp, and continue on your driving tour of LEGOLAND.</p>

<p><strong>Value: </strong>This is where the model shines &mdash; it has an above-average level of playability and size for this price point, and a fun theme which steps outside of the more typical town subjects of Fire, Police, and Gas Stations. &nbsp;I suggested this set to a friend last year&nbsp;(before having a chance to build it),&nbsp;and I am glad that the model lives up to my expectations.</p>

<p>Overall I thought it was a great set with lots of Playability.</p>

<p>Lego for once&nbsp;did something COMPLETELY different.</p>

<p>It used the standard car and could have been more detailed. If I had the chance I would completly redo everything thats&nbsp;not the car and the base of the ferry.</p>

<p>It has a couple of things I don&#39;t quite like:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. It has only ONE seat for minifigs and space for TWO cars plus a few bikes.</p>

<p>2. The ramps don&#39;t really allow for a smooth transition between the fery and roadplates.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like the ferry and have it planned for it to go into my lego city.</p>

"lentil","2017-05-16T17:50:46.477Z","A unique set well done!","<p>A ferry for transporting vehicles is a rare theme among LEGO sets. It is definitely a cool concept, and makes a great addition to a waterway area of your LEGO city display. The implementation is very basic, but the result is a simple, classy set with lots of play and display value.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigs are included: a businesswoman dressed in a nicely-detailed, feminine business suit, carrying a portable electronic device of some sort (no texting while driving!), and a bearded captain with a cap and red coffee mug. Neither are particularly exciting, but both torsos have back printing, and the designs are very appropriate for their roles in the set.</p>

<h3>The Car</h3>

<p>The build includes one small red car, with sporty convertible styling. The car is small and basic in design, with no movable doors, and room for only one minifig inside. Again, nothing particularly exciting here.</p>

<h3>The Ferry</h3>

<p>The ferry itself is the star of the set. First of all, I love the shape of the base. Slanted plates and hinges are used to angle the base into a long, shallow octagon. This allows the cabin to fit snugly to the center side of the ferry, while leaving the driving path unobstructed through the middle, and also creates a very pleasing shape to the overall craft. There is also ample room along the sides for several minifig passengers to stand about and enjoy the view during their journey, even if the ferry is packed full of vehicles. Creating the angled shape is probably the most interesting part of this very simple build as well.</p>

<p>Secondly, I appreciated the very solid construction of the ferry floor. It is built up of three layers of plate scaffolding, creating a wonderfully strong base. The pieces here include one large 16 x 16 dark grey plate, and two very nice 8 x 16 green tiles. This solid footing is great for playability, as the ferry can be easily picked up from anywhere and transported around without danger of crumbling or cracking. The bottom is also studded with multiple inverted rounded plates underneath, making it glide across a surface more easily - another small but thoughtful detail enhancing playability function.</p>

<p>The ends of the ferry have hinged gates. Although they do not snap securely closed, raising them does seem to keep the cars in place during transport. When lowered, their curved tiles allow for a fairly smooth ride on and off the ferry. You could fit 2-3 cars at a time on the ferry, depending on how big they are (3 if all are as small as the red car included with the set, 2 if larger), as well as some bikes/strollers/additional passengers along the sides.</p>

<p>The captain&#39;s cabin is small, and its only interior details are two steering wheels (one facing each direction). The blue trans windows all around look quite nice though, as does the angled &quot;light&quot; pole on the roof. The angled and curved posts supporting the cabin are simple, but visually striking and attractively done. There is also a small blue seat on the floor under the cabin. The cabin itself has no actual door, only a narrow opening. It is somewhat difficult to position the captain inside through this small opening, but the roof is easily removable for this purpose.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>That&#39;s really all there is to this simple set, yet it offers a lot of play potential. What fun to load people and vehicles onto the ferry in various configurations, then shuttle them across the water to their destinations. Visually, its bold lines and bright colors will look cheery in any city layout. An excellent set at a low price point - great job LEGO!</p>
