<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions and box are the standard size for Lego starter sets, nothing new here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice parts count, in two poly bags and one loose plate.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four figures here... two police,&nbsp;two crooks.</p>

<p>The police figures include what I believe to be a new torso, especially the female form. The male has sunglasses that are fairly new.</p>

<p>The prisoner is also&nbsp;new with very nice printing on the torso that resembles a&nbsp;&quot;pudgy&quot; tummy and back...&nbsp;Prison food must be good! The open stripe shirt reveals a stained &nbsp;orange t-shirt and the guy is&nbsp;identified as inmate 18675 on the back. Nice detail!&nbsp;The older crook has the nice leather jacket with grey/ black stripe shirt underneath. The sand blue legs look like faded jeans!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fast. The boat/jet&nbsp;ski looks great! The four wheeler looks good.&nbsp;I built,&nbsp;then rebuilt mine because I did not care for for the top heavy look of the &quot;roll bars&quot;. The police logo is a plus... It is a printed piece!</p>

<p>I will purchase another set to build a larger &quot;side by side&quot; style atv!</p>

<p>Honestly, I have not built the &quot;shoreline&quot; yet. It will yield its parts to an rebuild/enlargement&nbsp;of the hideaway from last year&#39;s set 60065-1 swamp police!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model should be a great hit with police fans... new bad guys and cops!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Well worth the price of admission of ten dollars just for the minis...</p>

<p>Jet ski and four wheeler is just extra icing!</p>

<p>I will be buying more just for new recruits for&nbsp;The Force.</p>

"mini_mads1980","2016-06-14T14:53:48.163Z","Great Value for Money","<p>Another Starter Set from Lego.&nbsp; Once again they have delivered a set that is affordable and provides lots of play value for kids.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This box is quite deep for the size of the set, but I can only assume that this is because of the cage piece to go on the ATV.&nbsp; The&nbsp;image on the front shows the whole set in a nice&nbsp;way.&nbsp; Three sides&nbsp;of the box give basic information, however the top of the box shows the ATV driver in the 1:1 picture and the two crooks who appear to be debating who gets the bigger&nbsp;part of the haul.</p>

<p>You get a&nbsp;quite large 32-page&nbsp;instruction booklet in the set.&nbsp; You assemble the Minifigures frist, then the Jet Ski, ATV and finally the small&nbsp;pier and rock.&nbsp; Rather strangely, inside the back cover you get pictures of the Deep Sea&nbsp;Divers sets&nbsp;60090, 60091, 60092, 90093 and 60095, but not any of the police sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No parts in this set that will be too desirable to many, but this set is about Minifigures and a&nbsp;lot of play.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get four Minifigures in the set.&nbsp; Two are law enforcement and two are crooks.&nbsp; You get male and female representatives of the police force.&nbsp; The female officer has a radio and is brandishing handcuffs ready to re-arrest one of the crooks.&nbsp; You do get a second set of handcuffs, so both crooks can be caught.&nbsp; The male policeman is supposed to go with the ATV.</p>

<p>The first crook has a bulging belly and a bag to carry his stolen money.&nbsp; The second crook has a pickaxe to open the secret hiding place.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Once the Minifigures are built you build the Jet Ski.&nbsp; It is a simple build, but reminds me of the scene from Police Academy at the marina and I really like the colours.&nbsp; You then build the ATV.&nbsp; Lego have tried to do something different here by adding a cage, but I don&#39;t think it adds anything to the build.&nbsp; Also, it slightly covers the printed 2x2 slope at the front so you don&#39;t see the whole of the police badge.&nbsp; The jetty and the rocks are nice but very basic.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like the light grey sticking out from under the jetty for the hinge,&nbsp;a darker colour to match the rocks would have been better.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set does not seem to fit together in my view.&nbsp; It should go with the new Prison Island, so a small police boat to chase the escaping crook would have added a bit more play value.&nbsp; This play element is included with the largest set in the line.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Probably the weakest of the Starter Sets, but the Starter Sets are all strong, so that does not make this a poor set at all.&nbsp; The value of the set is fantastic - four Minifigures and three small builds for less than &pound;10 - it&#39;s impossible to go wrong!</p>

<p>I personally think the ATV is the weakest part of the set, but when I showed the build to my two-year-old, he went straight for it.&nbsp; So what to I know...</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:56:13.193Z","Start New Builders off Right with Prison Island.","<p><strong>Set # 60127 Prison Island Starter Set: </strong>This is a set designed to introduce first time builders to LEGO City Prison Island sub-theme and it does an exceedingly impressive job of that. Providing some decent models to play with and Minifigures that can have a little adventure. For this review we&rsquo;ll discuss all of the aspects and then cover the final opinion.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: Classifying this instantly as a Starter Set, the image on the front shows off everything in the set prominently. The back includes some nice pictures of the set in action with examples of a story that could be played out with the set in question.</p>

<p>Instructions: These sets are mostly a bridge between younger builders as they go from easier and simpler sets to more complex sets. So the manual is a large enough size for smaller hands to easily flip through, and the steps are easy to follow and big enough to show exactly what goes where and when.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Male Officer: Not much else to say, if you&rsquo;ve seen one cop you&rsquo;ve seen them all, but this one is a good looking Minifigure. Includes a double-sided torso and a few accessories, a walkie-talkie, pair of handcuffs and a buildable flashlight.</p>

<p>Female Officer: If you&rsquo;ve always wanted more female cops in your LEGO City this is definitely a great set for getting multiples. She includes a unique double-sided torso print showing her uniform and badge, her face and hairpiece are pretty standard from other LEGO City sets, she&rsquo;s also holding a pair of handcuffs. A great looking Minifigure and the highlight of the set for me.</p>

<p>Crook 1: Wearing a dark jacket over his prison outfit, this crook has recently escaped. His torso is double-sided with printing showing off the back of the jacket and a lot of belts, he includes a black beanie and a gruff looking facial print complete with beard and mustache. He is carrying a pickaxe for some reason, probably to pry the piece of rock up where the money is stashed.</p>

<p>Crook 2: The only Minifigure with leg printing in this set, he includes a stained orange undershirt with his standard prison attire, his torso is pretty paunchy too, meaning he can&rsquo;t outrun the police very well. Attached to his back is the satchel pack to hold the loot after he rescues it.</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>The three models included in this set are very simple as is fitting of something called a Starter Set. You get to build a small one person speedboad, or jetski or something of that particular size. The police vehicle is pretty much an all-terrain vehicle which looks great and is fairly generic in design, with an opening cage for the driver&rsquo;s compartment.</p>

<p>Last is a small piece of dock, where the crooks have hidden their ill-gotten goods. It&rsquo;s a stationary model with enough space to fit two to three Minifigures. Everything about these three models works great, you have a fast and fun little play set style selection of models to play with, reminds me of the Brickset books that used to be made for certain Themes, and a selection of Minifigures to tell the story. You also get a printed element with Police and a logo included.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Starter Sets are fun little adventures in a box and definitely worth picking up. They remind me of the old LEGO Minifigure collections, but involve including a lot more to build and play with, they&rsquo;re a great opener to the theme for new builders and old pros will enjoy the ability to collect Minifigures in cheap packaged sets. Strongly recommended.</p>
