"Bobsy","2016-02-17T14:48:58.697Z","A flagship set - fun, but not spectacular","<p>This is what I consider to be a &#39;flagship&#39; set - the kind that, if you can only afford or are only interested in buying one set from a theme, you&#39;d usually pick up before any others. Flagships are never massively expensive, but at the same time are rarely the cheapest in the range. In fact, Police Pursuit exists at the cheaper end of the bell curve, being only &pound;18 in most places - but then that rings true for a lot of City sets - smaller, cheaper, more accessible for younger children. But if &pound;18 is enough to provide your child with everything they need to play out exciting cops-and-robbers games, so be it.</p>

<p>Provided the set doesn&#39;t suck, of course.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing altogether spectacular is included, although the exhaust pipe pieces included for the police car were new to me at least, and are generically useful enough that we&#39;ll probably see them turn up quite often in the near future.</p>

<p>The cop car uses a large pre-made chassis piece on which to build, which is a slight shame but hardly spoils it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Again, there&#39;s nothing exciting here. The cop is dressed in light blue and wearing a baseball cap, giving a distinctly American look to him, enough to match the other City police sets but having the Collectable Minifigure varieties look on bitterly that their more realistic never caught on.</p>

<p>The criminal... is dressed like every cliche halloween costume criminal has looked since the 1930s. Striped shirt over orange prison jumpsuit, appropriate as an escapee from the heavily-pushed prison sets that are also on shelves a the moment. But come on, it&#39;s more than a little on-the-nose.</p>

<p>I get why LEGO made him this way, of course. Most criminals dress like regular people and putting a regular person in the getaway car might make children think that the cop was hunting down an innocent driver. But still, the outfit is entirely without subtlety. And on top of that he sports the incredibly boring slicked-back hairstyle that we see way too often. Not even a beanie for our master burglar? Boo.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever built a Lego car before, you know what to expect here. The cop car is the more interesting to put together, using SNOT techniques for the front and back bumper, but otherwise there&#39;s nothing much to write home about.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>At the end of the build you get two vehicles, a cop car and a pickup truck for the crook to speed away in. The police car is the better-looking of the two, a sleek sporty vehicle that looks built for high-speed chases more than due process. Being a single-seater (sadly, like most LEGO vehicles) there&#39;s nowhere for captured criminals to sit on the way back to the station. This isn&#39;t so bad, as the set is about the pursuit, not the capture. But there isn&#39;t even anywhere for the cop to stash a pair of handcuffs or any gear at all. Considering the crook gets to clip a hefty crowbar to the side of his truck, the poor cop is going to be in for a tough time once the chase is done.</p>

<p>Speaking of the crook, his pickup truck is actually a simpler, blockier build than the police car and comes out looking less exciting. As before it&#39;s a single seater, but if the guy ever picks up any henchmen they can at least ride in the back with the safe full of money he&#39;s making off with. Unlike its driver, the truck is reusable, and could happily accommodate practically anyone, even non-criminals. Anything could happen. The truck is dark grey and dark red, so it certainly looks the part, although I&#39;ve rarely seen a truck like this with such a pristine paint job outside of a showroom. The crook probably stole the truck as well, of course.</p>

<p>(oh, I should add you also get a couple of white traffic cones with blue lights on them. A vital tool in the unending War On Crime! But they don&#39;t fit in the police car, of course)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Viewed brutally, this is a very average set. There&#39;s little to gripe about (not even the crook minifig - easily replaceable after all), but at the same time little to get excited about either. What it does have in spades is practicality. This is an adventure in a box, featuring a good guy in a good-guy car and a bad guy in... well, a probably-stolen-good-guy car. It does what a flagship set should do - act as the only set you ever really need. Kids could get the police station, prison island, even the mighty Brick Bank and they&#39;d still be just window dressing, subordinate to this set in terms of the actual play. If you want cops-and-robbers without needing to rob a bank yourself to afford it, this set delivers. Just don&#39;t expect surprises along the way.</p>

"Skut","2016-03-07T00:45:06.433Z","Cops and robbers!","<p>This set is the most recent iteration of a formula Lego has been working with for a few years now &ndash; the Police pursuit featuring both a &ldquo;goodie&rdquo; and a &ldquo;baddie&rdquo;.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a good concept and this set is the most successful version so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build for both vehicles is solid but not stand-out.&nbsp; Bag 1 comprises the Police car and Bag 2 the crook&rsquo;s pick-up truck.&nbsp; The building techniques are pretty run-of-the-mill, although the front of the crook&rsquo;s pickup has some interesting parts usage and building techniques which give the front of the truck a fresh &ndash; and quite aggressive &ndash; look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability for the set is top notch.&nbsp; The Police Car is the best yet to be rendered in Lego.&nbsp; Indeed this car so comprehensively outclasses the baddie&rsquo;s truck that you may need a Speed Champions set to even the odds; this is the first Lego Police car that looks like it might stand a chance against a SC set!&nbsp; The truck, as mentioned previously, has some interesting elements at the front but is otherwise a fairly typical example of a &ldquo;baddie vehicle&rdquo; for this set type.&nbsp; It does not feature the very robust construction techniques of some of 2016&rsquo;s other City sets (eg. <a href=""http://brickset.com/reviews/set-60115-1"">http://brickset.com/reviews/set-60115-1</a>) so you can expect to lose axles with rough driving.&nbsp; However, given the nature of the set as a chase scene, that&rsquo;s probably no bad thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs are, again, solid.&nbsp; The crook wears a prison escapee&rsquo;s outfit, including printed legs.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s apparently a recidivist because he hasn&rsquo;t even bothered to change clothes after his escape before taking off with a safe and cutting equipment in a (presumably) stolen truck.&nbsp; Rehabilitation has failed.&nbsp; Oh the humanity.&nbsp; The cop, meanwhile, features a contemporary sky-blue uniform, but without printed legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a few stickers for the Police car (and 1 for the safe door) but they&rsquo;re all pretty easy to position.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A very good set to buy for small people as it promises hours of play value around a classic play theme.&nbsp; For AFOLs and collectors, the Police car is a standout.&nbsp; Well worth getting.&nbsp;</p>
