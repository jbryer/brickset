<p>The front of the box&nbsp;depicts the large police cutter pursuing the smaller boat of the escaping criminals. Of course, you have the ever-present <em>LEGO</em> logo in the top left corner of the box. This set is recommended for ages 5-12. The back of the box contains many images of different play scenarios but because the set lacks many play features, there aren&#39;t many on the back.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The set contains a total of 200 pieces (as listed on the box) and has one large black boat hull used for the police cutter, and one smaller red hull for the crooks boat. The total build spans three bags - one for the boat of the criminals, and two for the police cutter. Overall the build was fairly enjoyable for the cutter, but the build for the crook&#39;s raft was a little cliche as it is essentially the same build as all the other sets that utilize that particular mold. The cutter, I thought, was potentially interesting. The large police stickers on the side of the hull are great and only add to the build (I strongly suggest putting at least those ones on). At the front of the boat is a large searchlight that can be manned by any of the figures included and it can spin a full 360 degrees. There are multiple dark transparent&nbsp;blue indicator lights dotted throughout the build and small details such as a life preserver really help bring the build to life. On the top of the boat is a prison cell. The idea is that the boat of the criminal is able to come along and use the grappling hook to free his/her trapped buddy. That and the fact that both boats really float are the two main play features of the entire set. I quite like the shaping of the main cockpit area and I appreciate the use of the fairly unused 4x8 half&nbsp;round plate to give the&nbsp;whole boat a sleek feel. The console in the cockpit uses two very common 2x2 printed slope pieces. At the rear end of the boat, there is a ladder that takes you to the main deck and a rack of tools and gear for your policemen. There is nothing inside the lower deck and it is just open space. I feel like they could have done something fun with that empty space, but oh well. The mold that is used for the criminals boat has been overused in my opinion however it means that&nbsp;we now have a whole plethora of colors to choose from which is great for MOC making. The boat consists of a grappling hook up front and a small motor out the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>The two policemen that are included in this set both use the same torso piece and both come with their own life jackets. All the figures in this set have printing on the back which is becoming more and more common these days. Both of the crooks are featured in other sets. The female crook has a black jacket and a dark brown hair piece. The male crook has a white prison vest on and he has a light gray knit cap. Overall I like these figures they have good printing and good personality.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>The two large hull pieces used in this set bumps up the price per part (PPR) a little bit but I still think this set is a good value for money and the exterior of the police cutter is very well detailed and designed. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about the interior, though. My two main concerns with this set are its lack of play features and the fact that, although well designed, the police boat is nearly a complete replica of set #7899. If the boat&#39;s design had been slightly different I would have liked it more. Overall I would recommend this set to most <em>LEGO</em> fans. The inclusion of two boats in the set add&#39;s to the play value of it all and lots of kids (and adults) will love playing with this set.&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for taking the time to read my review of set #60129 and I hope it helped you decide whether this set is one you are willing to buy.</p>
