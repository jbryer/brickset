"strategus","2016-11-05T21:37:31.2Z","Excellent color schema, playability and bang for the buck !","<p>This plane with two engines and variable-sweep wings remember me my childhood where the F-14 Tomcat dominated the skies over the seas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building</strong></p>

<p>The design used to move the wings is simple, reliable and well thinked for the scale.</p>

<p>My 5 years old son didn&#39;t have any issue with the building steps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Good diversity of parts, the choice of the color scheme is very appealing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>The playability is good. The plane is pretty sturdy for a 5 years boy.</p>

<p>When I borrow the plane I can&#39;t stop using the sweep mechanism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for the money</strong></p>

<p>3 models for the price of one. It is a Creator box of course! The second model (futuristic plane) is cool.</p>

<p>High five to the designer !</p>
