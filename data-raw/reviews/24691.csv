<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span style=""color: black; line-height: 115%; font-size: 11.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;""><font face=""Calibri"">Box art shows all 3 of the &ldquo;official&rdquo; buildable models on the front and back as well as the usual parts inventory.&nbsp; Inside are three separate instruction booklets, one for each of the alternate builds, and 2 clear bags full of pieces.</font></span></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p><span style=""color: black; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">124 pieces. Some of the rarer pieces you get in this set include <a href=""http://brickset.com/search?query=6047426+&amp;scope=All"">6047426 </a>Dark Green Plate with Bow, and 2 of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/search?query=6101285+&amp;scope=All"">6101285 </a>&ldquo;Earth Green&rdquo; 2x2 plate with bow which has only every appeared in 8 sets. You also get 2 of the Dark Green <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?S=31043-1&amp;bt=5&amp;sortBy=0&amp;sortAsc=A&amp;viewCodes=Y"">6134974</a>&nbsp; Mud Guards, a piece that seems rare as no image exists for it on <span data-scayt-lang=""en_US"" data-scayt-word=""Briskset""><span>Briskset</span></span> and <span data-scayt-lang=""en_US"" data-scayt-word=""Bricklink""><span>Bricklink</span></span> is currently listing it as &ldquo;New&rdquo;.&nbsp; For vehicle building it&rsquo;s always useful to have&nbsp; <a href=""http://brickset.com/search?query=6066119&amp;scope=All"">6066119</a>, which you get here in Dark Stone Grey. Paying about 8p per piece is very reasonable given the variety of pieces included. It was also nice to get 2 of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/search?query=4225532&amp;scope=All"">4225532</a> 1x1 brick with handle and the smooth transparent red flat tiles. For parts, this is an awesome set. No stickers included</span></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><span style=""color: black; line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11.5pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Calibri; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-fareast-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;"">No <span data-scayt-lang=""en_US"" data-scayt-word=""minifigures""><span>minifigures</span></span> are included and none of the vehicles are really to <span data-scayt-lang=""en_US"" data-scayt-word=""minifigure""><span>minifigure</span></span> scale</span></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span style=""color: black; line-height: 115%; font-size: 11.5pt; mso-bidi-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;""><font face=""Calibri"">The &ldquo;Chopper Transporter&rdquo; truck, although a quick build as you&rsquo;d expect from a set of this size, &nbsp;features a lot of detailing on the truck that they didn&rsquo;t have to put on, but they did; and in this respect it&rsquo;s a very pleasing build. The other two variants are very quick, 3-4 minutes each and much simpler.</font></span></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 12pt;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"">The &ldquo;Chopper Transporter&rdquo;, the main build, is assembled in two sections, with the orange / white helicopter first. This is a great little model, realistically proportioned and with some great detail given its tiny size. The transporter truck is really nicely done, too, with some great detailing using a lot of small pieces and a really nicely shaped and proportioned cab. The chopper clips onto the flat bed at the rear by means of a <a href=""http://brickset.com/search?query=6126082&amp;scope=All"">6126082</a> 2x2 plate.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"">The tractor is a quicker build and looks good. &nbsp;Despite all 4 wheels bring the same size on this tractor, the likeness is good and the detailing nice. It has a detachable <span><span data-scayt-lang=""en_US"" data-scayt-word=""plough"">plough</span></span> or some kind of agricultural device that can be clipped on to the rear. Overall in looks it resembles a beefed up <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30284-1/Tractor"">30284</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin;"">The &quot;<span><span data-scayt-lang=""en_US"" data-scayt-word=""off-roader"">off-roader</span></span>&quot; is a neat little jeep-type-thing that sort-of resembles, and would be a good competitor for, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31040-1/Desert-Racers"">31040</a> Desert Racer and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30283-1/Off-Road"">30283</a> from 2015&#39;s Creator range. Perhaps these jeep/buggy builds are Lego&#39;s go-to idea when trying to work out what to do for build number 3 of these Creator sets! Still it looks very nice and you can probably even drive it from race to race on the back of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31033-1/Vehicle-Transporter"">31033</a>, if you have it. It&#39;s compact and tidy and does the job very</span> well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Sometimes these 3 in 1 Creator sets feature a great primary build and then the other two tail off in quality. This is not one of these sets. All three models offer great looks and playability, and have really nice details. The instructions promote a combination with 2016 Creator sets <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31040-1/Desert-Racers"">31040</a> (to race against the off-roader), and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31041-1"">31041</a> (to be transported on the truck). The art on the instructions also shows the deck crane from the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31045-1"">31045</a> set mounted on the back of the Transporter truck and lifting the &ldquo;mini sub&rdquo; out of the water, whilst the helicopter from this set lands on the ship&rsquo;s deck.<br />
<br />
So; lots of play opportunities. For me, though, the real winning factor from this set is the pieces &ndash; 124 pieces, with a wide variety,&nbsp; quite a few pretty rare ones in rare colours, for under a tenner -&nbsp;it&#39;s a great bargain.</p>
