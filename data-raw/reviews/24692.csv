<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Basic packaging, not much to say here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good parts selection, I like the inclusion of dark orange parts and small ball joints.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple build, kind of repetitive&nbsp;for the legs of the dog. The other models of course don&#39;t use some of the pieces.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The dog is a great model, with loads of cuteness and the ability to pose the limbs in great ways. The face and ears are very expressive. The owl does not have as much playability but still looks good. The squirrel looks a bit like a kangaroo but is still pretty good.</p>
