<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is about the size you would expect for this kind of set, and is made of the thinner cardboard.&nbsp;There are 3 instruction booklets (on thin paper), one for each of the models.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The corner plate 3x6 corner plate in Earth Blue is unique to this set according to the Brickset database, and the single&nbsp;Beam 1M W/Cross Axle in Medium Stone Grey is new for 2016. The SNOT bricks and the 4&nbsp;Flat Tile 2X2 Round W. Hole pieces were appreciated.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Like many&nbsp;Creator sets, there are no Minifigs included&nbsp;due to the scale of the model.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Although short, the build was enjoyable. Parts come in 3 unnumbered bags. The small submersible is built first, followed by the main vessel. There are no tricky stages. Each step contains a very small number of parts.</p>

<p>I have not built the 2nd and 3rd models. The 2nd&nbsp;model is presumably a seaplane and is built in 60 steps.&nbsp;The 3rd&nbsp;model (some kind of submarine) is&nbsp;small, and the instructions contain just 33 steps compared to the 56 of the main model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The main model looks great IMHO, the colours&nbsp;are spot on and every aspect is well built, especially the nicely curved bow. There are some great details such as the radar and &#39;tyres&#39; on the side of the vessel.</p>

<p>The main model has some decent&nbsp;playability given the size of the set, the small submersible can be picked up by the crane and placed on a stand in the back of the boat. The boat (and indeed the seaplane)&nbsp;has 4&nbsp;Slide Shoe Round 2X2 elements underneath to allow it to &#39;glide&#39; across carpets etc.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I thing this is great little Creator set, with a good combination of detail/realism/playability and good value for money. A great start to the Creator range for 2016, more like this please Lego!</p>

When i finally got a hand on it, i was surprised that it is quite a bit bigger than i had expected with measuring 8x16 stud. I guess it looks smaller due to its bulky and somewhat &quot;sweet&quot; proportions, with very well formed details (given the scale).</p>

<p>The build is quite straight-forward, with some snot-techniques to it to form the curved walls, but due to it&#39;s size there is nothing much suprising.</p>

<p>The parts are not very special (this is totally good for creator), but the earth blue parts are very welcome and combined with red and white, they make the model look quite maritime.</p>

<p>Playability is quite good for a creator set ... of course there are no minifigs or the like, but it can slide on plain surfaces thanks to the round slide shoes at the base, and it has a crane and a cool looking submarine robot that fits in the loading bay. The crane is bulky due to the scale, but it can do everything needed to unload the sub.</p>

<p>The second model being a plane is very nicely done too. It&#39;s very bulky and heavy (and therefore stable), having the same sweet look as the primary model. Definitely one of the best secondary builds in the small creator sets area.<br />
The third model is some uninspired submarine ... honestly it looks so ugly i don&#39;t have an urge to build that one.<br />
And there seems to be a fourth building instruction digitally, for a ferry ... while i appreciate that, and it works for other sets (green dinosaurs!), it&#39;s nothing overwhelming in this case.</p>

<p>Given the great first and the very good second model, and the price that was asked for when this was available, overall this is an extraordinary good, modern creator set.</p>
