<p>The box is a about the expected size for the price, and is made of a relatively thick&nbsp;cardboard. There are three&nbsp;different instruction manuals, one for each model, with the one for the main build having a slightly higher quality cover.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>230 pieces are included, most are bright red, white or black.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Like most Creator sets there are no minifigures&nbsp;included, however there is space to sit a minifigure in the cockpit.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The main build has 95 build steps. The build process was enjoyable, although being an aircraft it is no surprise that there is some repetition. There were no real surprises, although I had not realised&nbsp;that the wheels are retractable as these are not shown on the front of the box. There are no difficult/tricky building techniques.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have not built the second or third models, the second is a reasonable&nbsp;looking helicopter, and the third is some kind of fast boat. Both consist of 64 build steps.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks great, and to my untrained eye looks like a decent representation of light aircraft that frequent my local airfield. I think the &#39;bright red&#39; with black and white colours&nbsp;are a good choice. Play wise there are&nbsp;retractable wheels and the canopy opens. The propellers can be spun but due to their shape won&#39;t spin when the model is moved through the air. The only very minor complaint I have is that the control panel piece looks a bit too advanced for such a small aircraft (the same piece is used in the 31039 Creator Blue Power Jet).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When this model was first announced I did not make much notice, but when I found it reduced in price (by 20%) I decided to go for it and I am very pleased I did. It looks fantastic and as such will be on display (perhaps hanging from the ceiling using transparent wire)!</p>

"Hashem1983","2016-05-23T09:37:41.647Z","Minifiguer Friendly","<p>Usually, when I buy a creator set I am buying it for the parts, however when I bought this set it was specifically for the high-tech hydroplane build, but as usual I&nbsp;must assemble all three to see how it is like in real life.</p>

<p>I must say that this set has&nbsp;arrived to me in the right time as I had experienced an unpleasant&nbsp;moment and needed something to channel&nbsp;my mind.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was in the mid-size with the Lego Creator label, the propeller plane is the main build while the Helicopter and the hydroplane are the primary&nbsp;builds that you find them small on the side of the box and all three at the back.</p>

<p>You get 3 instruction booklets for each model, but I got to say since I am an old school Lego, there are some steps that could have been combined in one page, I&#39;m not talking&nbsp;about this set only but mostly all kind of sets are somehow becoming like mouth feeding, back in my days there wasn&#39;t this box that tells you what pieces or parts that you need on each step, however, it was easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Though most of the parts are plates, angled plates and some bricks, but for me the cockpit and the nose of the jet are new pieces to add to my collection including the 1x2x2 brick with studs on the side is a wonderful&nbsp;and a useful piece. You also get the printed black 2X2 slope piece that is printed as a control panel, which is nice, and some technic pieces and wheels.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>No minifiguer, but you can add one from your own collection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Though the instructions was easy, however, I enjoyed building the Helicopter more, the Propeller jet was a nice build but it was some how repetitive because of the wings, I felt the Helicopter was a bit on the advanced, the Hydroplane was also a fun build and though its the third build, and usually the third build is the simplest, I felt it was the most set that had LESS Leftovers than the helicopter, it should&#39;ve been the second primary build and not the third.<br />
In general, I loved how the build of the engines in all three models, especially the hydroplane, all in all, a wonderful building experience.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All three models are exquisite, it has a nice color harmony, and though the Helicopter was my least favorite model when I saw the pictures but it turned out to be great, and it has been built beautifully as its a real&nbsp;thing, the propeller&nbsp;plane was also nice, but as I said the Hydroplane was my favorite build and I had to adjust the seating of it for a specific reason, when I saw it I thought it will be Cool set for Batman, but only if it was in Black!!!!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Its a great set, I do recommend it, and I hope Lego keep on producing sets that do&nbsp;not need to have a minifiguer in it but to be friendly and suitable for it, this set could be used in your city collection if you are looking to have something unique, especially the Helicopter, its different than what we are used to see in most of the sets...&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">The Creator 3 in 1 line is all too familiar with a plane, a helicopter, and a boat in the same set&rsquo;s model list. However, with 230 pieces for only &pound;17.99 or $19.99 or 19.99&euro;, Propeller Plane may warrant a further probing.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">Minifigures</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">This set does not contain any minifigures, which I believe is quite a disappointment. I mean Creator sets are not known for their minifigures, but several sets have been released with minifigures in vehicles, especially recently, with sets such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31094-1/Race-Plane"">Race Plane</a>. A minifigure always adds to the play value and cannot be turned down.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">The Completed Model</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">The plane is of course the main model and looks fabulous. The flowing, solid, Bright Red color scheme makes this set exemplary. Unfortunately, there is not enough yellow to brighten up the remaining structure, but still enough to mess with the final look. In other words, TLG should have added more yellow or none at all. Thankfully, the white, gray, and black parts send this craft soaring.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">Angle bricks, slopes, and tiles blend together to create the fantastic finish apparent across the model. I could not have designed it better myself. I cannot discern the exact make of the plane, but it still is a wonderful piece of engineering. The smooth surface contrasted by mechanical details is absolutely fabulous. So as far as this build is concerned, it passes with flying colors.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">The second model is a less than stellar helicopter. The blades feel incomplete, lacking in the tile department. Likewise, the tail rotor juts out of a Technic brick and is rather bland. I will say that the tail locks into the main body splendidly with no issue. The stabilizing wings are a nice touch too. A mechanical jumble is the best way to describe the roof and rotor mount. The misplaced yellow appears again here. Also, I am sure that better thought could have been placed into the nose. So the helicopter plunges far below the incredible plane.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">The boat&rsquo;s nose is a polar opposite and perfectly encapsulates the front. The pontoons stretch out of the sides and make use of some crisp color choices.These do have a slight blocky look at the tips and that annoying yellow has a few pieces present as well. The back of the cab sweeps back into the ripped engine. This set&rsquo;s unfortunate color doesn&rsquo;t fit the aesthetic at all. However, the rear spoiler more than makes up for the awkward appearance. I actually had the boat built for the longest time out of all the models.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">Overall</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-cf52f9d5-7fff-a85c-f6b3-10131e0f5d84"">I would recommend a purchase of this set, provided you are only interested in the boat or plane and if you do not have interest in some of the better offerings of Creator. I am not disappointed in my purchase of this set, but you may want to look elsewhere. </b></p>
