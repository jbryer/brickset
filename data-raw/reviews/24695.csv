"Buku","2016-01-15T21:18:16.26Z","A relaxing set (and that moose!)","<p>My first reaction to this set was simply &quot;I need that moose&quot; but I also liked the feel of the set in general. I have only built the main model, more on that later.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard fare for creator. All three builds shown on the&nbsp;box art, unnumbered bags,&nbsp;and a booklet for each build.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is obviously a nice selection of darkish brown bricks&nbsp;and I don&#39;t think you can ever have enough roof tiles.</p>

<p>I have not seen the little flowers used for the lilies&nbsp;before. One of these has also been used in the frying pan&nbsp;for what is most likely meant to be an egg.</p>

<p>The little ink well for the quill is also a rare piece and adds a nice touch.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One guy with a&nbsp;blue check shirt which seems like appropriate wear. Not a fan of the face though; a little goatee and a smirk doesn&#39;t fit the set to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I really like the little&nbsp;corner table built into the wall ever&nbsp;so simply. Otherwise the lodge build shouldn&#39;t surprise anyone familiar with creator. I built it with the wife in.... no idea how long it took. I was just enjoying the simple pleasure&nbsp;of a nice build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Moose body is&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple but effective&nbsp;SNOT build.The legs are a clever combo too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Stunning. My favourite set in a long time. There is just something intrinsically peaceful about it. Perhaps it has a little&nbsp;to do with my desire to be fishing in a log cabin in the woods but that&#39;s&nbsp;certainly not all of it.</p>

<p>The little details are great even for creator. The mini jetty, the fish or&nbsp;bait bucket, the cooking fire, the lily&nbsp;pads, the little shelf for the compulsory mug.</p>

<p>I particularly like that the interior seems to have enough to be kind of realistic.&nbsp;A bed, a stove, a table/shelf. 100% livable.</p>

<p>Last but not least is the moose. Not usually a fan of brick built animals but this one just fits. It caught my eye when I first saw the images online and did not disappoint.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It looks so good I haven&#39;t tried the alternate builds yet and I can&#39;t see that happening anytime soon. In fact, perhaps I&#39;ll buy another one...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"turtlestack","2016-02-06T20:43:30.693Z","LEGO at its finest","<p>This feels like one of those sets that will be looked at as a classic. There is just something about how charming this set is that seems, to me, to define what LEGO is&nbsp;all about. In fact if I had to explain to an alien species what LEGO is all about I would give them this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an expert LEGO builder nor have I been seriously into LEGO for very long, but I get the feeling that if you ever wanted to learn how some people on the internet and at conventions build those beautiful MOC buildings with all the fantastic little details this is the set where you can learn many of those techniques at their basic level.</p>

<p>Every single step of this build teaches you how to make a sturdy, functional, and also beautiful&nbsp;model. Details such as the exposed ends of the log beams, to the stove, bed, and writing desk, and the way the yard, ground, dock, and water are worked into the overall model are simple, sturdy, and effective. Nothing about this build feels cheap, there are no shortcuts where you have to use your imagination to see what the designer intended - everything about this model is charming and looks fantastic. Even the moose is great (and is why I initially picked this up from the shelf at the store).</p>

<p>I would imagine this set would look very nice with&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60117-1/Van-Caravan"">60117:&nbsp;Van &amp; Caravan</a>&nbsp;and/or&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31052-1/Vacation-Getaways"">31052:&nbsp;Vacation Getaways</a>&nbsp;- in fact I&#39;m absolutely going to at least get the Van and Caravan to make a fun little vacation getaway scene.</p>

<p>I love this set and can&#39;t recommend it enough! This is LEGO at its best.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions were easy enough to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Great parts. Lots of basic brick in brown. Love the tan and green windows. The 2x2 round plates with holes in the middle (lily pads) are a nice touch. There is also a brown one in the tree.&nbsp;I&#39;d like some more of these.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Not a very exciting minifigure, though the black hair piece is (I think) new to me.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Straight forward brick on brick build. Just the kind I like. Reminds me of the sets I had as a kid.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very nice model. Like the title says, it makes me want to (well maybe not move but) visit Alaska and stay in a log cabin for an extended vacation. The tree is a neat design. The moose will be fun for my kids to play with.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>One of the best sets I&#39;ve build in a while. I like creator buildings, but the combination of brown and creator was great. I liked this one a lot more than the Deli set. It feels more substantial than the Deli, which felt like&nbsp;disappointingly small model. This one, however, feels just the right size.</p>

<p>The Lodge feels a bit overpriced at MSRP, but at 20% off, it was a good deal. I&#39;m considerina 2nd one...</p>

<p>I rarely write reviews, but I think this one deserved the effort.</p>

"conservationist","2016-05-08T10:08:51.55Z","A Lazy Lodge","<p>A must have from day 1, this set captured my attention with its generally lazy atmosphere and setting. A wonderful piece by the Lego Group, this lodge captures the serenity of countryside living.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard Creator box, the frontal background fits the setting very much while the reverse shows the other forms that can be constructed. The bags are unnumbered and each alternate build has its own little instruction booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts were diverse and included many brown pieces in different shapes and sizes. In my opinion, the small 1x1 pieces in assorted colours were the best as they added different texture and highlights to the structure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A rather standard minifigure. The hairpiece adds a little more character to the minifigure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was excellent and extremely simple. The addition of the details at specific parts of the build kept me hooked to see which other detail they would add next. For no particular reason, I especially liked the simple bed made of medium blue and the hanging lamp outside the doorway.</p>

<p>The build of the moose surprised me as the legs used a technique I have not come across before. Then again I have not built many brick animals.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks fantastic and portrays the scene of a lonely mountain lodge tucked in the wilderness. It has sufficient details on both the exterior and interior. The use of rounded green plates also helped to break up the straight lines and make the model seem more natural, giving the set more character.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment-->This set makes me feel kind of lazy. For a city dweller like me, fiddling with this set every once in awhile would evoke scenes of peace and quietness. I believe that this set would be perfect for everyone, regardless of age. The only problem would be the price point, a reduction of several dollars would make this set a must get. <!--EndFragment--></p>

"KingAlanI","2017-05-29T14:57:30.7Z","Small but very detailed","<p>I got this to go with my camping collection (CMF S16 Hiker and Friends Adventure Camp).<br />
The build was very detailed; LEGO has a habit of that and I love it. I suppose the 1x1 round plates on headflight bricks were to simulare the ends of logs<br />
The model did feel small though. Often a bunch of tiny pieces make a set sound larger than it is because of the high piececount.<br />
The bed was covered in tiles so the figure wouldn&#39;t stay put when laid down on it. I expect that from minidoll sets, not minifigure ones. As with minidoll sets, I didn&#39;t use the tiles. However, I liked Slope 30 1x2x2/3 (part 85984) as a pillow. The yellow chair outside did not have this problem.<br />
A flower in 2x2 round tile with hole (part 15535) was a great lilypad. I didn&#39;t like the same flower piece in a frying pan, presumably representing scrambled eggs. Itlooks nice but won&#39;t stay put, could get lost if the model doesn&#39;t stay level. Kitchen accoutrements in LEGO sets are often like that.<br />
The roof could be built before attaching to the cabin walls.<br />
The hinges were good to open the model for display and play.<br />
I don&#39;t like it at full price, but it was fine on sale.</p>
