"Nouri","2016-01-12T17:04:47.317Z","The Cornerstone For All LEGO Cities!","<p>Tldr; Great set with good colors, detail, and overall a great model. Totally reccomend.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Box comes in the standard size for Creator sets of this price range and not too different from the norm. The art features the main build on the front as well as the two other builds off to the side. The back features all of the builds in comparison as well as their play features showcased.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I must say, the parts in this set are absolutely phenomenal! It comes with a plethora of rarer blue and red-orange pieces which are very nice indeed. The colors look great and a welcome addition to any collection. Along with that you also get a good amount of neutral gray and black bricks which can be re-purposed to make your own building. You also get three&nbsp;8 x 8 plates which is a nice addition as well. This set does come with a couple printed pieces for the grill as well. The added addition of a very large amount of black window frames and a door with plastic plating is very cool too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set only comes with two minifigures which is the standard for creator building sets of this price range. You get a small girl who is the one paying for the sandwiches as well as the employee at the sandwich shop. The employees torso is very nice and features mustard and ketchup stains to resemble the sandwich making workplace. The girl features standard printing for a child. It would&#39;ve been nice to include one more minifigure to accommodate the upstairs building however that is a very miniscule complaint.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The build</span></h3>

<p>The build is a pretty standard process which involves mostly stacking 1 x 2 bricks and a couple other combinations of bricks to create a sturdy building. The roof design is very nice and involves some interesting building techniques and almost feels like the same techniques you would see when building a Module Building albeit squared down.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall the completed model is a beauty to look at. Both the interior and exterior feature detail unseen to models of this size. The colors of the build compliment each other very nicely and help to make it stand out amongst the crowd. The display ability of this set is phenomenal as well as it looks very good as both a stand alone model as well as along side other Creator models.</p>

<p>Although not featured on the package, if you were to purchase two of these sets you can form a completely different build. The third build featured (The skinny townhouse with 2 stories) fits in where the large burger is allowing you to exchange it into there and make the build look a bit more full if you like. There are also technic pins on the sides of both building to allow you to feature other models there as well which is another nice bonus.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I do think this is one of the best Creator sets for its price range to date. It features unmatched detail along with a great color scheme and overall is a great model. As a corner piece which is very rare for this price range you get a very nice addition to any city which I totally recommend. Just to get an idea of how good this set is, I&#39;m going to buy two more of these for my city just for the parts!</p>

"torf","2016-01-30T16:04:02.29Z","Quite clever","<p>For the third year running Lego provides a relatively inexpensive Creator set that will enhance any City layout. Unlike most buildings in the City line, which tends towards a rather modernistic style, these Creator sets set out to model the sort of old buildings predominant in most European cityscapes. Incorporating several techniques from the much more expensive Modular buildings line these sets serves as an excellent introduction to what is commonly referred to as advanced building techniques. I&rsquo;ve focused on the main build in the following.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As is to be inferred from the set name, the main build is a corner. How this is achieved is one of many delightfully clever surprises the set has on offer. Using a handful of bricks, an 8x8 plate and 2 strategically placed technic 1x2 with 2 holes, an old fashioned, square, fold open, building is given a new role as a city corner whilst retaining its old properties of closed and folded open to form a double fa&ccedil;ade. &nbsp;Now why hadn&rsquo;t I thought of that?&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The rest of the ground floor is, to be honest, a bit of a disappointment. There&rsquo;s a simple preparation area and a hatch / sales window. Apart from this the build is rather simplistic offering little more than place this brick on top of this brick. Access to the first floor is by ladder. A rather sensible decision, given the space available, although most likely not in accordance with the building codes. The inclusion of a fire hydrant is a nice touch given the prevalence of fire engines in your average Lego city. &nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Moving on to the first floor and things improve dramatically. The main window is the most ambitious I&rsquo;ve seen in a model not aimed at an adult audience. Using a combination of jumper plat offset and headlight and cheese bricks to create an outstanding, three dimensional effect. A scaled down version is provided next to the door leading out to the balcony, providing a wonderful sense of continuity to the facades. &nbsp;Once the walls and windows are complete it&rsquo;s time to furnish. Given the extremely limited space available the designers have done an amazing job, managing to squeeze in a small railing, a cupboard and a lovely mini-build club chair. There&rsquo;s even a small table lamp utilizing a Fez brick. I choose to regard the latter as a not-so-subtle suggestion the Deli might someday be modified into a D&ouml;nner. As on the ground floor, access to the roof is by ladder.</p>

<p><br />
The roof is yet another pleasant surprise. The parapet, while simple in its construction is remarkably well executed. Stylistically it works with the windows below to create an architectural unity that helps set this set apart. Access to the roof is through a SNOT glass scuttle built using the not-so-obvious properties of the 1x4x1 fence piece. The roof comes with an old style TV aerial complete with a mini-build roosting bird. I&rsquo;ve been taken with these quirky birds since I first encountered them in the Medieval Market Village and as always they provide a simple but efficient enhancement to the completed model. &nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Finishing off the model is the corner and the Deli sign. The corner comes with a small table, a stool and two small lamps. On the table is a bottle of what, judging by its sickly, orange, colour, can only be Irn-Bru. Of note is that instead of using two Technic connectors it uses one connector and one connector/crossale. This makes it much easier to detach / attach the corner whilst retaining the structural integrity. The Deli sign is a SNOT build that does a decent job of masquerading as a baguette given the limitations posed by the medium. It&rsquo;s cleverly constructed so as to be flippable, a necessity if the building is to be displayed as a double fa&ccedil;ade.</p>

<h2>The model</h2>

<p>As should be clear from the above I&rsquo;m quite taken with this set. Simplistic ground floor aside it looks lovely, particularly in its corner configuration. The two minifigures provides the necessary roles for the consumer-vendor scenario suggested by the nature of its subject. The use of dark orange and medium blue as the main colours works well with the grey decorations and parapet. The suggested age range of 8 to 12 is probably correct as to building it unassisted but with some assistance I would think a younger child might enjoy it as well. The completed model, TV aerial aside, is surprisingly sturdy and offers quite a few play options. I&rsquo;ve had several 5 and 6 year old girls playing with this set and they seem to rather enjoy the opportunity of not having to put out fires or catch robbers.<br />

"Sethro3","2016-12-29T20:17:07.28Z","Bob's Kebobs is moving up","<p>After feeling disappointed with the Toy &amp; Grocery Store set, I was hesitant to get this one. I don&#39;t love the color scheme, but the build idea looks interesting and it adds a corner to the midi modulars.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Interesting color usage. Decent amount of actual bricks.</p>

<p>- Interesting roof detailing.</p>

<p>- Fun sandwich signage.</p>

<p>- Window detail looks neat, although feels a bit reused.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- I don&#39;t love dark orange and medium blue together, but separately they are great colors.</p>

<p>- Reused figures again.</p>

<p>- Tiny corner building, but it fits in with the others of the series.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend this set over the Toy and Grocery set. And you can usually find both on sale, so win-win. While I don&#39;t love the color scheme, it does create something different than normal, so that is something. I&#39;ve started a larger Modular scale version of the building, and I can&#39;t make it as substantial as I want due to my inability to get over the colors. But when built as it is supposed to be, it is a more substantial build than Toy and Grocery.</p>

<p>It looks stunning on the shelf. The color is contrasting and matching.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blue and orange brown parts are very useful for remoc. There are 3 doors and many windows which are again perfect for city buildings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price can be slightly cheaper though.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"The_Brick_Guy_87","2017-07-04T07:03:54.223Z","My favorite of the Creator mini modulars so far","<p>I bought this set in 2016 when my parents were on a holiday for some time. It is the second Creator mini modular I got and my favorite of all 4 sets by far (31026, 31036, this and 31065). Read to know why. This review will cover the main model.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>467 pieces, one more than the piece count of the Toy and Grocery Shop. There&nbsp;are mainly medium blue and dark orange parts here, which is pretty nice as the aforementioned 2 colors aren&#39;t very common. Pretty great parts selection.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Takes about an hour and a half. There aren&#39;t much special building techniques here but the hamburger back window decoration are nicely built.</p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p>You have two minifigures and a deli once you build the main model.</p>

<p>Firstly, the minifigures. You get a girl and a baker. The girl has a light brown ponytail hair, girl face with freckles, a blue jacket and red shirt underneath it and blue kid legs. The baker has a red cap, a smile on his face, an olive green baker torso, which was first seen in one of the 2014 LEGO Movie sets and white pants. Standard minifigs, but they are nice.</p>

<p>Onto the building. The exterior is well detailed. There is a fire hydrant, two small lamps, a table with a drink and a chair. There is also a small window, from which the customers get served. The most noticeable thing is the big hamburger&nbsp;sign. Apparently it is fit with ham, cheese, tomatoes and salad. A very nice decorative element. There are 2 doors- a transparent front one and a yellow back one. The are some flower stands at the windows which have green and yellow round 1x1 studs. At some places on the walls, there are dark tan 1x2 &nbsp;&quot;brick&quot; bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Onto the interior. The first floor contains a cash register and an oven as well as a ladder leading to the upper floor. On the oven, there is a sandwich, which is just a 1x2 tile with a green flower stud for salad and pink 1x1 round stud for ham and flat 1x2 tile. There are two of them, the other one is supposed to go on the girl&#39;s hand, according to the instructions. The oven has a flat printed 1x1 round tile, which was first seen in the 2015 Changing Seasons set, I think. The second floor contains a dark orange armchair, a small lamp and ? yellow cabinet as well as another ladder, this one leading to the roof. There is also a door leading to the balcony. The second floor is a little bit cramped, but it isn&#39;t bad. To access the roof, minifigures&nbsp;have to climb up the ladder and open up the skylight. There is what appears to be a TV antenna, although there is strangely no TV inside. There is a small bird with white wings, a grey tail and a red head.</p>

<p>Lastly I will take a look at how the corner section is built. Like other buildings in this series, a couple of two specialized connected 1x2 bricks. However, an 8x8 plate is connected&nbsp;to the side, which has the specialized bricks. So the two parts of the building can not fold up, next to each other, because the 8x8 plate is &quot;blocking&quot; them, so it makes a corner section. A simple, but smart method.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is an excellent&nbsp;set. It works very well in any city and is nicely playable on its own. I highly recommend&nbsp;purchasing this set if you are a Creator or City fan. If you find this review unhelpful, please contact me to give me advice to write better reviews. Goodbye!</p>
