<p>***Please note I have not seen the movie yet, so my view of this set is a little lost at this time***</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is in the typical Superheroes theme. &nbsp;Shows the set, with the minifigs in action doing battle with each other around the simple platform (my one son has decided it&#39;s the top of Avengers Tower, but I won&#39;t get into that with him). &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>92 parts molded in grey, tan, black, green, orange, and one printed bat signal. &nbsp;There&#39;s also one sticker for a computer screen that attaches to an angled piece. &nbsp;Not sure why it wasn&#39;t just printed on like usual computer pieces. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs is where this set shines. &nbsp;Batman is in dark grey/silver, with battle armor, and a great grey flowing cape. &nbsp;His back pack can hold two items, like his batarangs. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Superman is in his dark blue suit drawn from the new movies, and has a wonderful red cloth cape, and swept back black hair. &nbsp;He has two faces, one with heat vision engaged.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The Build was pretty straight forward. &nbsp;There&#39;s really not much to the platform, of which I can not really decide what it is. &nbsp;The top of a building? &nbsp;A battle platform? &nbsp;What with the floor level&nbsp;mounted computer? &nbsp;The Bat Signal that is really a flick fire missile? The odd swiveling fence with two large antennae, with guns? &nbsp;Which is the weakest part of the build. &nbsp;It rotates on a one stud piece, and constantly pops off. &nbsp;I&#39;d rather have seen a them use the tried and true rotating piece.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As stated before, the minifigs are great. &nbsp;Still unsure what the platform represents. &nbsp;It&#39;s just odd. &nbsp;The kryptonite&nbsp;pieces are pretty cool though. &nbsp;There&#39;s been a lot of hub bub about Batman and the gun in the Trailer&#39;s and it&#39;s included here too. &nbsp;Not very Batman like.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s good playability in the set. &nbsp;The clear jumper for either minifig to use. &nbsp;The flick fire Batman signal, the flick fire gun for Batman (oh the humanity), and a silly little push pin at the back of the platform that can knock a minifig over. &nbsp;The platform as a whole just doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The minifigs are where this set shines. &nbsp;I love the armored Batman. &nbsp;And to get Superman in the set as well, was a no brainer when you have to get one set for two boys to share. &nbsp;</p>

"Gouniaf","2016-03-25T09:40:24.763Z","Where is that kryptonite spear ?","<p>Usually with the Star Wars sets, the most important characters are in the most expensive sets. It seems TLG doesn&#39;t apply the same logic on DC sets, as we got the two main superheroes in the cheaper set of the Dawn of Justice line.</p>

<p>[img]http://i84.servimg.com/u/f84/15/86/98/65/clash_14.jpg[/img]</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Only 92 parts in the set, enough to build a nice rooftop to display your two heroes. Some pieces are rather interesting, as the printed Bat-Signal, the green crate, the kryptonite crystal and the sand grill-plate.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>[img]http://i84.servimg.com/u/f84/15/86/98/65/clash_15.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>The main argument to buy this set. The most iconic of the DC universe in the same box ! Batman wears his steel armor from the movie. It&#39;s a shame that the grey armor hides the beautiful print of the torso, but on the other hand, the hooks on his back allows the minifigures to get equipped with a batarang and a grappling hook. The head is fluorescent, which is a cool feature.</p>

<p>[img]http://i84.servimg.com/u/f84/15/86/98/65/clash_16.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>The son of Krypton is much more classic, with is blue suit and red coat. Hopefully, he doesn&#39;t wear his red underpants on his pants. Printed legs would have been better, but the minifigure is still really good. The black hair hides the second face on the back on the head, with the angry red laser eyes. The normal face is smiling, so we can recreate both the fight against Batman and the reconciliation.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Well... You&#39;ll need less than 15 minutes to build the set, included the coffee break. There is no doubt that this set is worth for the minifigures, and the little build can be seen as a bonus.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment-->There is only one play feature wih a technic bar to get Batman down : rather useless. After seeing the movie Batman v Superman, I regret that the features doesn&#39;t look like in the fight scene : guns coming out from containers, or Batman being equipped with his kryptonite spear instead of his kryptonite-gaz shotgun. And I&#39;m not sure about the trans orange antennas, they are out of place in a set from a dark movie. But, after all, this is a toy for kids !<!--EndFragment--></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>One of the best sets concerning the value for money. I&#39;m not a big fan of DC and Marvel sets, but I think this box is a must have for any Afol, with these beautiful minifigures.</p>

"Turtlemoht","2016-03-31T09:31:44.337Z","The smallest, and possibly best, set from the Batman v Superman line","<p>The movie&rsquo;s out and it&rsquo;s time to take a closer look at the smallest set of the Batman v Superman line...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As you would expect, this set uses the smallest box of the Batman v Superman line and the artwork is exciting.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For a small set, there&rsquo;s a lot to like here, with pieces provided in a range of interesting colours. I particularly like the large &lsquo;grill plate&rsquo; in tan, the multiple antenna pieces in trans orange and the printed bat-signal dish.<br />
The figures also provide some interesting pieces, with Superman&rsquo;s new hair piece and Batman&rsquo;s one-hole cape in grey. More on these in the next section.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Understandably there are just the two figures included in this set. However, both are fantastic and unique to this set.<br />
The Superman figure is the same as the figure included in 76046 Heroes of Justice: Sky High Battle apart from his single colour legs. Personally, I prefer this version as Superman&rsquo;s boots aren&rsquo;t particularly prominent in the movie and I find the red a tad bright.<br />
This set also includes a new &lsquo;tousled&rsquo; hair piece in black which is great. It sits a little tall on the head but it represents one of those rare cases where it looks representative on the minifigure even though it&rsquo;s not particularly accurate to the character as they&rsquo;re shown in the movie.<br />
The Batman figure is a must own. When the first images of these sets were released I immediately liked how Lego have interpreted the armour suit, particularly how &lsquo;regular&rsquo; Batman uses the new, &lsquo;short ears&rsquo; cowl, while armoured Batman uses the old style &lsquo;long ears&rsquo; cowl, that also includes a chin cover. No, it&rsquo;s not accurate to the film but I think it&rsquo;s a fantastic interpretation- and I&rsquo;d rather they use existing moulds.<br />
Both the cowl, armour piece and cape are actually very dark grey, rather than black, which gives the figure a great gun-metal look. Also, the cape used is the old &lsquo;starchy&rsquo; fabric and it has just one neck hole (Superman&rsquo;s is the usual two-hole style in stretchy fabric). I don&rsquo;t know if this is an older cape design or a one-off for this set. Either way, I like having the alternative version.<br />
Under the armour, the batman figure has some of the best minifigure printing I&rsquo;ve seen. Even without the armour, this is possibly my favourite Batman figure as the printing has texture and detail, even to the point of showing the ribbing in the fabric.<br />
Lastly, Batman&rsquo;s head glows in the dark. I don&rsquo;t know if this has been done before but wow, it&rsquo;s really effective when combined with the cowl.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s not a whole lot to the build. It&rsquo;s a simple platform with a breakaway guard-rail and a box in which to store some spare kryptonite ammunition. It uses a mix of grey, black, tan and trans-coloured pieces and there&rsquo;s one tiny sticker for a control panel/screen that I didn&rsquo;t apply.<br />
I mentioned the wonderful printed Bat-signal piece earlier. This is mounted on a pivoting arm on one side of the build and looks great. The signal itself is mounted on a flick-fire missile which (from my viewing) wasn&rsquo;t in the film. I&rsquo;d have to guess that something was cut as the feature doesn&rsquo;t really make sense- but I&rsquo;ll take it as the printed piece is wonderful.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set stands out as a little vignette for (possibly) the best scene in the film. Add a bunch of trans-clear pieces to have superman hovering above the scene and you&rsquo;re all set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Realistically this set is all about the two figures, and on that basis alone this is a must-buy.<br />
Throw in a range of interesting pieces and a printed bat-signal and, for the cost, this is the best set of the year (for me, so far).</p>

"Hashem1983","2016-04-02T20:28:48.5Z","Great for the Figuers, but still its Great!!!","<p>By the time I&#39;m writing this review the movie is out but I haven&#39;t still watched it, but I&#39;ve been wanting to have a Batman Minifigure, I also missed the Batman and&nbsp;Super Angry Kitty set but I was lucky to get this.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It comes in the smallest Lego Box with the DC Comics Super Heroes Label, and a battle between the Man of Steel, Superman with Batman on top of building roof, which is quite a small size but OK, and on the back it displays the features of the set.<br />
It comes with one booklet instructions and it is easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Maybe this is the smalles set of the themed movie, but for me it has a few unique parts that I have never had before, like the 8x8 Net Plate and in tan Color, you also get the PRINTED Bat Signal, a Hand Rail,&nbsp;a green container and a green Crystal that represents the Kryptonite.&nbsp;Plus some&nbsp;normal Bricks, slopes, plates, orange antenas and few technic elements.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>After Seeing the other sets from the Movie, Batman is the most unique minifigure as he has:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Printed torso and legs</li>
	<li>Double sided face with glow in the dark eyes (But it does not glow that much)</li>
	<li>An&nbsp;Armour that its only exclusive&nbsp;to&nbsp;this set and you could hang&nbsp;the bat boomerang and the Hook on it</li>
	<li>A grey batman cape</li>
	<li>A stud shooter that shoots kryptonite and a gun that you could load the hook in it, you also have the option to combine the gun with the stud shooter to make it look like the bazooka in the movie.</li>
</ul>

<p>As for Superman, he has a nice soft cape and a double sided face one of them is the angry face with red eyes as it represents the laser that its coming out of it</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was simple yet it has some nice techniques in it like the bat signal which is actualy a flick mistile that you could throw it on Superman and it is also loaded with kryptonite, the flick on the back where you make Batman jumps towrds the Rail.<br />
It is a simple build but iw was also Fun.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Its a nice display model that kids could play with it as you get two great super heroes in one nice small set, also as an adult and you like these super heroes you could display it on your shelf or even your office, it is up to you.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am very satisfied with this set, I am Happy that I got Batman and with it I also got Superman, to me most of items in this set (Regarding to the parts) are new to me or I never had these parts before.<br />
I have built a small tower to place this set on the top since I have no place to put it, yet it was fun to create something specific to this set.<br />
I do recommend it for all the fans whatever your age is.<br />

"Kelvin_Lego_Man","2016-04-03T06:41:21.987Z","Small but packs quite a punch! ","<p>Recreate the greatest gladiator match in the history of the world without worrying about burning a hole in your pocket!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box features an&nbsp;epic clash between the son of krypton and the bat of Gotham atop a small rooftop section, with the back of the box boasting&nbsp;an array of&nbsp;play features to delight both the young and young at heart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside you would find a folded instruction booklet, the pieces in bags and a smaller cardboard box containing the capes for the minifigures. The instructions included are easy to follow and are similar to other instruction booklets included in most regular lego sets in the market.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Consisting officially of 92 pieces, you could expect to find an exclusive printed bat-signal, which is easily the highlight of the set aside from the minifigures. Additionally, other notable finds include a transparent&nbsp;green kryptonite&nbsp;crystal, a rectangular&nbsp;green crate to store additional ammo for batman&nbsp;and 2x&nbsp;Orange antennas (which i&#39;m guessing are used to represent the antennas for a skyscraper).&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a small set, this might not be the most economical&nbsp;option to source for spare parts for your own lego creations, as i believe most people would obtain this set to acquire the minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Now, this is the main reason why you would get this set, isn&#39;t it? ;)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&gt;&nbsp;Batman&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest incarnation of batman is totally beefed up with&nbsp;amazingly details,&nbsp;a gorgeous&nbsp;torso and printed leg elements. Sadly, the gunmetal gray armor piece covers up all these wonderful printing, but makes up for it with clips at its back to hold the grappling hook piece and bruce wayne&#39;s&nbsp;signature batarangs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure does come with a double-side printed face and yes, it glows just as it should, re-creating the epic moments as seen in the dawn of justice&nbsp;movie&nbsp;trailer. Moreover, the dark knight is also equipped with an interchangeable weapon, which can split into a grappling hook gun and a stud-shooter.</p>

<p>The only downside is that batman gets the old type of cape which could get crumpled easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&gt; Superman&nbsp;</p>

<p>Superman comes with no printing for the legs but comes with a fairly detailed torso and a new hairpiece which is more accurate&nbsp;towards the movie depiction. The contrasting printings on the torso is worth appreciating and the minifigure&nbsp;has&nbsp;a double-sided face, with one showing a happier expression and the other featuring an angrier face with red eyes. Thankfully, superman is included with the new softer cape which is more durable.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A simple, fast, yet satisfying build;&nbsp;i took less than 15 minutes to complete it. The front railing portion with the orange antennas&nbsp;are&nbsp;designed to be knocked off easily and the bat-signal can be&nbsp;a big flick-fire missile. There is also a feature which you can launch batman from from a hidden launcher at the back of the build. However this tends to be the only flaw of the set, as the feature might not work properly if the feet of batman is placed too firmly on the studs of the base piece.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What you see is what you get; a&nbsp;small, delightful&nbsp;diorama which is a nice little display set, or could be modified to be placed on the rooftops of your lego modular/city buildings. I woudl recommend&nbsp;adding&nbsp;a transparent lego&nbsp;rod piece for Superman, which amplifies the effect of having superman in the air looking down at batman XD&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you are looking for a set to add to your lego superheros collection, or just&nbsp;hoping for an inexpensive memorabilia&nbsp;after watching the dawn of justice movie, this set is perfect for you :) I would highly recommend this set to lego superhero fans as a fun and inexpensive collectible &nbsp;for your collection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The box and instructions are cool with nice illustrations as expected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some very nice see through coloured pieces and a grate like base piece. There are 2 cool batarangs and a new, exclusive, printed batsignal piece aswell!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The armoured Batman is awesome, the prints are very detailed and has a great glow in the dark head! The superman figure is nice as well, but it needed some leg printing and the normal face is too jolly, it should be more neutral. Both figures have alternate faces.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing special, as the build is small, and relies on one 8x8 base with a grate like look.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Has some nice, simple details and 2 or 3 action features, it&nbsp;has a flickfire batsignal, and a techinc piece that can push over a figure.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Cheap and cheerful, the figures are worth the &pound;12/$13. The set can be a nice gift or spot to pose minifigures. Which side are you on though!!!!!!</p>

<p><strong>Superman&nbsp;</strong>minifigure. Excellent torso printing and nice soft flexible cape.</p>

<p>Although in the movie Superman is brooding and angry most of the time, it&#39;s nice to have a smiling, optimistic and heroic facial expression. Even though the hair-piece doesn&#39;t match the film version, I like this element&nbsp;showing more flowing hair. Of note I wish he had red boot leg printing but it&#39;s minor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some other Super-Jumpers I&#39;ve had work well and the figures come on and off easy (the&nbsp;small Age of Ultron set and the Ant-Man set), this one is tight on the legs. Have your kids use the diagram in the instruction booklet and not force the figure on or off the jumper.</p>

<p><strong>Armored Batman.&nbsp;</strong>Fantastic figure! The new armored piece is great. Nicely sculpted and molded with duel clips in the back for any weapons or accessories. Printing details on the figure is incredible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Batman&#39;s helmet looks good but wished they did the more movie accurate short/flat ears. I assumed a new sculpt for this would drive the price point up. Note, the cape is the older stiffer material. It works though better for this figure when you put the armored piece over it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is the duel faced Bruce Wayne (stoic and angry). It&#39;s a glow in the dark head, so don&#39;t forget to charge it with light and then put the helmet back on. Works nicely mimicking the glowing Batman eyes in the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here we have the rooftop&nbsp;play-set. This is a stripped down version from the movie where Lex Luthor&nbsp;manipulated Batman and Superman&nbsp;to engage each other in combat. Batman lures Superman using the Gotham Police Bat-Signal and set up traps to kill Superman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the movie there are a lot more gun and fire traps BUT this little set has a lot of fun play features. The breakdown below...</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1481/25692564164_3205f5bf37_z_d.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 373px;"" /></p>

<p>Here is a mounted machine gun trap on a railing that swivels left and right. Note the two trans-fire orange antennas. Use the Super-Jumper Superman to launch into it so it&#39;ll topple over to trap Batman. It comes off easily as it&#39;s mounted on a round 2x2 jumper plate. Also the use of the color is to show Superman&nbsp;using his eye-beams to heat up the antennas.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1457/26297443435_d97b4ca48c_z_d.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>The Bat-Signal. Great NEW printed element. It&#39;s a large flick-fire missile to attack Superman. It can swivel 360 degrees and tilt left and right. Use the trans fire-orange cone to hold onto and fire. Also this element again is to mimic Superman heating up the area to damage it.</p>

<p>Last three pics above show a nice crystal Kryptonite&nbsp;element, a green crate to hold extra trans-green studs (Kryptonite gas grenades) and you can mount the stud shooter from Batman&#39;s grenade launcher atop crate as an added trap weapon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another fun play feature: You can launch a figure&nbsp;by standing it in front of the back railing (don&#39;t stand them in too tight) and tap quickly the pin in the back.</p>

<p>Notice behind the Bat-Signal there is a trans-green stud. This is another hidden trap by Batman to weaken Superman when it strikes him. BUT, this is also part of an additional special weapon. See below...</p>

<p>In the set you can create the Kryptonite Spear(!)&nbsp;by using the flick-fire missile with trans-green stud, a lightsaber&nbsp;element (which you&#39;re given an extra one so you don&#39;t need to take off of machine gun trap) an atop place the Kryptonite crystal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a wonderful compact playset! Tons of play features, incredible minifigs, unique new elements&nbsp;all for the low low price of $12.99 usd!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether you love, hate or are indifferent to the movie...this is must get set! You&#39;ll have tons of fun with your Affleck Batman and Cavill Superman battling for who&#39;s the mightier actor...I mean HERO!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T21:56:29.293Z","Somewhat disappointing model","<p><strong>Set #76044 Clash of the Heroes:</strong> In order to show off the penultimate struggle between the two main characters from the film this small 2016 set gives us a bit of LEGOised interpretations as to how the battle between Batman and Superman would go in the film, as usual it isn&rsquo;t entirely screen accurate, read on to find out if this set is still worth picking up.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: Another small box this set is pretty poorly executed as far as showcasing it goes, however that&rsquo;s mostly because this set isn&rsquo;t the biggest draw from the BvS collection. There is however a few glow-in-the-dark elements in this set which the box shows in typical feature showcase fashion. This is also the only set with the Super Jumper piece from 2016, a play feature that is showcased on the back and isn&rsquo;t a terrible loss according to some fans.</p>

<p>Instructions: For a set this small the manual works. You have the easy to follow guide to building the set, the typical cross-promotional images of the other sets in the wave and the parts list to know how many pieces are in the model. For a set of this size it&rsquo;s always difficult to signal out the elements in a standard review format, however it&rsquo;s important to share everything so a complete picture can be formed about the elements of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Nothing in this set is unique or stands out, with exception to the Bat Signal printed dish and the Minifigure accessories, everything else is standard and easily found in other sets, minus perhaps the clear orange antenna pieces which we haven&rsquo;t seen in this colour since the days of Classic Space, and then they were much less opaque compared to these newer elements.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Batman: This version of Batman is in his armoured up form from the end of the film and he looks pretty impressive, I&rsquo;d say he&rsquo;s the highlight of the set. His head is a glow-in-the dark variant with double-sided printing, one has the less angry or stern expression and the other is his &lsquo;Do You Bleed&rsquo; expression. His torso features some awesome printing on both sides for his armor and he&rsquo;s got leg printing as well from the waist down to the knees.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s using the older cowl piece though, since without it the Glow-in-the-Dark head wouldn&rsquo;t work as well. For accessories he includes a stud launching kryptonite weapon, a new armor piece that slides over his torso, silver batarangs and a grapple hook for climbing, his cape is different as well as it is meant to slide on underneath the armour piece. Overall a great new version of the Dark Knight.</p>

<p>Superman: Man of Steel Superman has been updated with a minor thing, his torso has a new double-sided print for the BvS costume, his legs feature no printing this time and he has the newer cape piece which is the softer version. He&rsquo;s also got a nice new hair piece that better captures the likeness of the character as seen on screen, he&rsquo;s missing the traditional S curl here. His head is double-sided and shares facial prints with the original MoS versions, one side having the heat vision expression and the other side showing a happy smiling face, I guess he&rsquo;s really glad to be fighting Batman.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build for this model is very quick and easily built, there is nothing tricky or difficult, as this is a simple model set piece that is designed more to be played around with instead of stand out as a decent model, at this price point it is what you&rsquo;d expect it to be. I must admit that this set is a bit more disappointing where it comes to the build, it isn&rsquo;t as satisfying as past sets in this price range have been. Comparing it to the Man of Steel set it seems to be a lot less parts use, which is most unfortunate.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the top of a roof with a bat signal on it and a couple of play features, &lsquo;breakable&rsquo; elements and launching missiles. It is definitely designed to be something younger builders can build and play with compared to other better sets from the DC Super Heroes line. It&rsquo;s extremely disappointing honestly, relying too heavily on gimmicks and not enough on what could have been a much better display for older fans.</p>

<p>That isn&rsquo;t to say it&rsquo;s terrible or anything, younger fans will definitely enjoy pretending to fight with Batman and Superman where Superman tears off a chunk of the roof to threaten Batman and Batman can launch his bat signal into Superman after weakening him with the Kryptonite. Or use the technic axle in the back to send a Minifigure flying by launching them off the centre of the model.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Personally, as a movie tie-in set this one isn&rsquo;t terrible, it features the iconic battle from BvS and includes some interesting Minifigures for a cheap price. That being said, unless you really want the Batman set I&rsquo;d have to say you can safely skip this in favor of the larger sets with better models. I&rsquo;d slightly recommend this one for the Batman, the Batsignal piece and maybe some of the other parts, if you don&rsquo;t need them you can safely skip it thought.</p>

"Aaron_Moss","2017-02-17T20:40:44.907Z","Great set but be warned!","<p>The reason why I say &quot;be warned&quot; is because there is more then one version of this set on the market.&nbsp;The first one from early 2016 included&nbsp;Batman&#39;s cape but&nbsp;at some point in the year they removed it, I sadly found that out the hard way!&nbsp;Thankfully you can tell&nbsp;which one you&#39;re getting&nbsp;by looking at the box, if the cape&nbsp;is included it&nbsp;will be on the cover picture and if&nbsp;the cape isn&#39;t on the cover picture then it&#39;s not included. Thankfully if you have the right information you can order the cape from LEGO customer service! Now with that part behind us (Forgive the pun) the actual set is very well made and It&#39;s a great addition to your DC comics collection!</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2016-06-21T03:09:57.81Z","Dawn of Justice","<p>Hello brickset users and welcome to yet another review. This time, we are taking a look at DC Superheroes, Clash of the heroes, from the Batman versus Superman movie. Let&#39;s dive into the review</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: The box shows the product on a lonesome building. On the back, it shows the multiple action features of this set. The instructions were really easy to follow and I didn&#39;t even have a problem with the single sticker or the technic parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: We have a lot of really cool parts in this set. The new grapple launcher is especially cool, especially when connected to the kryptonite&nbsp;gun. The Batsignal is yet another cool part, as it has only been seen in a few sets. The orange antennas are really nice. The Super Jumper, I&#39;m welcome to the inclusion of, primarily since I haven&#39;t owned one before I got this. The color scheme of the build is quite interesting. You also get a batarang in a new pearl silver color.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: The figures are really nice. Superman has a new cape that is wonderful. He also has an updated hair piece, making him look more like the movie variants than the comic ones. Batman also has a new look, cast in dark grey. The armor piece and cape piece that goes with the figure is excellent, as well as the krytonite bazooka. Batman and Superman&#39;s heads are double sided. Superman has a nice, happy expression and one using his heat vision. Batman&#39;s faces are pretty muc the same, one being kind of disturbed, the other one being seriously mad. Batman&#39;s head can also glow in the dark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The build was really simple and it could only take a couple of minutes, depending on your age.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: I like the model quite&nbsp;a bit. The minifiures and the set are really good. Now, let me talk about the action features. The batsignal&nbsp;can become a kryptonite missile. Batman&#39;s stud shooter can shoot studs. The guns can rotate. The piece with the antennas on it, can easily swivel and be broken off. The lever at the end can send a minifgure flying for a distance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: I really like this set. Both kids and collectors can enjoy it. This set has tons of action features, appealing this set to kids. This also resembles a scene from the movie, making it nice for collectors. The price is not too high, and the parts, the action figures, the build and minifigures will make this set great for everyone.&nbsp;</p>

"Lee_Fogel","2017-09-20T16:18:56.817Z","A surprisingly fun set to build AND play with!","<p>We bought this for my oldest son (<em>who was 6 at the time</em>) as it looked like a good way to get him a Superman minifigure and the Batman that he identifies with (<em>as the Christian Bale movies he has not seen</em>). I admit to feeling a touch underwhelmed when I looked at the box and contents but for $12 I was not going to complain. It turns out it was money very well spent.</p>

<p>Both figures are unique to this set with their outfits replicating the &#39;<strong>Batman vs. Superman</strong>&#39; movie outfits. The Batman figure has a glow in the dark eyes which works well when the lights are off. It&#39;s a bit of a novelty but one we have enjoyed time and again. If anything, the Batman figure has too many tools/weapons to choose from and he can become bulky and hard to manipulate if you have all of them attached to him at one time. The Superman figure is as you see him and is a fine representation of the Henry Cavill actor from the movie.</p>

<p>The base/rooftop playset is a nice surprise. It has the Bat signal and the shield with the bat emblem is designed to fly off with the flick of a finger. The gate/antenna base swivels and can be easily &#39;broken off&#39; if the two minifigures are fighting. The green box on the side has a lid that pops off can house the kryptonite&nbsp;pieces for Batman to use against Superman. You could also store other things in it like the stud gun that Batman comes with. Finally, the small stud sticking out from the back side of the base can be used to knock over a minifigure with (<em>again</em>) the flick of your finger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set offers a high level of play and two unique minifigures. It goes together easily and quickly. Furthermore, the base/platform would be a nifty addition to any home-built superhero base or even adding it to the rooftop of a Creator, City or Modular Buildings set to smartly add Batman to your Town theme. We wound up with two extras of this set and have not blinked an eye at all as the value is easily spread out in the other sets that my son has. Highly recommended and get it before it is gone. I doubt that this one will be released a 2nd time.</p>

The amor is very cool and the printing is also cool. But where is the CAPE? I looked on missing parts and broken pieces and I DIDN&#39;T find it Is the cape in the SET? Please help! Did anyone else have this problem?<br />
Superman- The printing is nice and it looks right out of the movie. The cape is the soft one which is a nice touch.<br />
Pieces- The pieces you get are great. You get a batsignal which is printed. You also get a great and nice looking grapple gun.<br />

This set is great and I would recommend it to a friend. The value is great but the only problem I have is the Cape.</span></div>

"Nookman8","2016-08-04T04:30:12.2Z","""Next time they shine your light in the sky, don't go to it.""","<p>Hi everyone! This is Nookman8 with my first review on Brickset! So, let&#39;s not wait any longer and get right into &quot;<strong>Clash of The Heroes</strong>&quot; from the DC Comics Super Heroes Theme.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing overall exciting. It&#39;s what you expect from LEGO with their box art. The instructions are also nice and&nbsp;easy to follow but nothing mind-blowing in there either.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on the other hand are awesome! There&#39;s a&nbsp;nice printed bat&nbsp;symbol&nbsp;disk, a grabbling gun piece, two antenna&nbsp;pieces in trans-orange, a net piece (which are always cool to get), a trans-lime green crystal piece (which represents kryptonite), and crate in green.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are cool. Superman comes with a new hair piece and comes with a pretty faithful representation of his suit in the movie. His cape is the nice cloth-like material we&#39;ve come accustomed to since last year. But, if you just want Superman, then you should invest in getting the &quot;<strong>Heroes Of Justice: Sky High Battle</strong><em>&quot;&nbsp;</em>set which has him rocking dual-molded leg pieces in red and blue.</p>

<p>Batman in his armored suit is exclusive to this set and trust me, you&#39;ll not be disappointed&nbsp;with him (Besides one thing he has on him but I&#39;ll talk about that later). The breastplate of his armor is very useful with futuristic army like minifigs&nbsp;and he comes with the&nbsp;2013-2014 mold of his mask in grey. His face print is the same as his 2015 iterations except on a glow in the dark head piece which could be nice for MOCs. The only thing wrong with it is that it comes with the starchy cape that should have been discontinued&nbsp;last year. But, I guess maybe the cloth-like cape wouldn&#39;t work well with the armor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t all too exciting but still was fun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is sturdy (Besides the turret)&nbsp;and&nbsp;okay when it comes to play. The turret-machine-thing is fastened on by a single stud so don&#39;t count on it for staying together while playing rough. The bat symbol part of the build is also alright as it is basically an amplified flick-fire missile ... except it usually shoots not even a few centimeters.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is great if you like building MOCs or collecting LEGO pieces. But, if you don&#39;t do&nbsp;any of those things, then the play value isn&#39;t so great. So, I give this set a 4/5 if you fit into the first two categories&nbsp;and a 3/5 if you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been Nookman8&#39;s&nbsp;review of &quot;<strong>Clash Of The Heroes</strong>&quot;. I hope you found it helpful ... even though I feel like I was little&nbsp;opinionated at some points.</p>

<p>Anyway, bye!</p>

<p>the build isn&#39;t as bad as it looks as it comes with a nice bat signal and krptonyte and 2 grapple guns for batman, a nice coloured garbage can in bright green, the super jump piece works well enough!</p>

<p>so</p>

"calzonie","2022-07-18T06:52:56.92Z","Perfect for Minifigures and Parts, Messy Final Product","<p>Clash of the Heroes is a great parts pack, but the finished product is pretty underwhelming if you&#39;re just following the instructions.</p>

<p>The minifigures here are amazing, with Superman in the dark blue&nbsp;costume and Batman in a gunmetal suit of armor. The bulky chest plate would have been enough on its own for an&nbsp;accurate look,&nbsp;but LEGO went above and beyond by adding an incredibly detailed&nbsp;torso print hidden underneath it. This Batman&#39;s eyes also glow in the dark, which is such a perfect idea that I can&#39;t imagine why that glowing piece was never used again.</p>

<p>The build here is a small section of the roof of the GCPD with a&nbsp;fantastic printed dish for the Bat-Signal. The set is really tiny, but even still it&#39;s built well enough that I can picture what the rest of the building might look like if this design were expanded. The whole set is made from cool pieces you could reuse in a MOC, and honestly it&#39;s better off being bought for individual parts than as a display or play set.</p>

<p>The play features are where this set falls flat on its face. I&#39;m not against play features at all, but these are really poorly implemented and make a cluttered mess out of what should be a cool&nbsp;little rooftop. The Bat-Signal is converted into a flick fire missile that doesn&#39;t work very well because it&#39;s firing a giant dish. The signal is also positioned in a weird place, you can&#39;t angle it toward the sky like it normally would be without it covering most of the floorspace.There&#39;s a weird gun fence thing with orange lasers blocking the stairs&nbsp;(does Batman expect that to slow down a man that he knows can fly?). On the back end of the rooftop is a rod that I think is supposed to knock someone over, but it doesn&#39;t have the reach to hit a hero that&#39;s standing on the part of the floor without pegs. There&#39;s a clear jumper piece to launch Superman into battle, and it works decently, but it&#39;s really difficult to get a minifigure in and out of it.&nbsp;They make me worried I&#39;m going to break the figure&#39;s legs every time I try to use it.</p>

<p>This set is absolutely worth it if you want a great exclusive Batman minifigure and a bunch of useful parts.&nbsp;But it&#39;s really not a good build on its own, so if that&#39;s a dealbreaker then maybe steer clear of this one.</p>
