"Bl0ck_Head","2016-01-09T03:04:16.817Z","The Dawn of Justice Begins!","<p>Hey, this will be my second review of any LEGO set on the Brickset&nbsp;site, and it will be my first Bat-mobile&nbsp;ever,&nbsp;hope you enjoy it, and it gives the information you need.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set uses a decent amount of new parts and older parts, but the part that really makes it all come together would have to be the Windshield parts, it just makes the design look and feel a lot more sleek.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Comes with three Mini-figures, all double sided faces with one being a none-expression face, and the other being a more aggravated/angry face, Batman has the new&nbsp;cloth type of cape and&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;double&nbsp;colored&nbsp;legs&nbsp;with&nbsp;black&nbsp;boots,&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;two&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;are&nbsp;Lexcorp&nbsp;henchman, and turns out Legolas started working for Lexcorp and cut/dyed his hair brown, guess he needed to get away from Middle-Earth for awhile. Gotham was probably not the best choice for a vacation.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build on the forklift is pretty nice and simple, there is a trigger on the back that flips the driver out and (sometimes) flips the package off the forklift. The Bat-Mobile has two plate stud shooters&nbsp;on the front, and two shield type pieces that make it look like an engine vent&nbsp;that can move up and down, the windshield can go up and fold out which is a nice feature I have not seen for a bat-mobile, but then again, this is my first!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think the completed model is extremely good, its very durable you can slam it on the ground and no pieces (should) go flying off, it can drive well on both low carpet/flat surfaces, the forklift won&#39;t drive that well on low carpet due to small tires.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think if you are a Collector or just a Fan of DC-Comics in general you should buy this set, the only two things I did not like were the fact that the two shield pieces that are on the front of the car&nbsp;on page 59/68&nbsp;of Book 2 were a little hard to get into the clip piece.</p>

<p>The second thing is that&nbsp;it really needs a Lexcorp truck or small van to put the Kryptonite into, but then that would increase the price, but other then that this is a great set to buy at 29.99, so stop waiting and go collect this thing!</p>

"MFT_Kyle","2016-04-04T15:27:53.847Z","The Ideal Set at the Ideal Scale","<p>With the Batman vs. Superman premiere now in the rear-view mirror, it seems like a great time to revisit the most recent Batmobile&nbsp;release as both a stand-alone set, and as an extension of the newest DC blockbuster.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>While there can be little surprise when it comes to the density of black pieces in a Batmobile set, the range of pieces included in the set provides a strong offering of rare or recently-molded pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Batmobile, for example, contains as many angular pieces that someone could hope for from a Superheroes set. The rear half of the set, and the side panels, consist almost entirely of sloped or angled pieces, all of which influence the overall sleek look of the car. Moreover, the new cockpit style, the pentagonal tile immediately behind the stud-shooters, and the small spoiler pieces mounted above the front wheels are all welcome, and considerably rare, pieces that only add to the set&#39;s initial appeal.</p>

<p>The forklift comes with fewer surprises, but its blessing is the simple fact&nbsp;that it IS a forklift. While Lego has made a number of these in the past, their concentration in the City line have given them few, if any, appearances in Superheroes sets. While the roll cage is not particularly rare, the lift and fork seem to have made very limited showings in the past. Finally, the green gems or in this case, &quot;Concentrated Kryptonite,&quot; is just a fun, welcome bonus to already strong piece selection.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Considering the scene that this set is influenced by, it&#39;s understandable that the villain selection is somewhat dull, divided among the two Lexcorp figures. While it would be fun to hope for a different Lex figure, it would certainly skew the accuracy to source material. Having said all that, the three figures included do more than enough to satisfy on the minifigure-side of things.</p>

<p>The two Lexcorp&nbsp;henchmen are terrific in my opinion, and offer a solid variety of faces that are not limited to the set. With the goatee head appearing in only one other set and the clean-shaven face in only four others, their heads alone are nice, albeit simple offerings with flexibility. The printing of their torsos are both terrific and leave little to be criticized with any real value.</p>

<p>As for Bats himself, Lego delivers once again and represents the Gotham hero accurately. The printed pattern on the torso brings his new material suit to life and the wide bat-symbol looks terrific as it stretches across the entire chest. The shorter ears make for a wonderful change of pace in my opinion, and like the henchman, leave little to criticize or think poorly on.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The construction of Lego vehicles feels somewhat typical at this point, even when considering the density of a forklift and the long, stretched appearance of the Batmobile. Counting in at just over 300 pieces, it is a relatively fast build with few complicated elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the thoughts that most car-building is a bit of a bore in the grand scheme of Lego, I must admit that the exterior design and building process of the Batmobile kept me interested all the while. The piling on of the&nbsp;sloped and angled pieces was a blast, and only when you build it do you get a good sense of just how many moving parts the set truly has. The bells and whistles of the sleek body design fully redeem the otherwise standard construction of both vehicles.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Those &quot;bells and whistles&quot; that were mentioned a second ago are exactly the features that allow for this set to flourish in my opinion. Stud-shooters, spoiler-covered turrets, wheel protectors, the diagonally opening cockpit, and the bit of movement available from the angular pieces situated above the cockpit are all brilliant inclusions that make this rendition of the Batmobile feel dynamic, fast, and versatile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forklift, despite its own size limitations, also offers plenty in the way of its operational lift, flick-missiles, and an exploding play feature which takes an otherwise simple little vehicle and turns it into something far more fun.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The biggest influence of &quot;overall rating&quot; for me is the quality of a set held against its&nbsp;price-point. Considering that standard, I can comfortably say that this Batmobile, even with&nbsp;the DC licensing and&nbsp;three excellent minifigures, is one of the best buys in my collection. Unlike some licensed sets which take advantage of tiny, repeated pieces in order to justify a higher price, this set comes in just under ten cents a piece, all the while offering a diverse and exciting piece collection. And let us not forget it, it is a Batmobile.</p>

<p>Just as the Hulk Buster Smash set created a new personal standard for Marvel sets one year ago, the Kryptonite Interception sets a new standard for DC. Whether a Batman fan, a vehicles fan, or just someone who likes to build, Kryptonite Interception offers something for everyone - and then a little bit extra, too.</p>

"Lordmoral","2016-05-12T00:15:35.097Z","A neat impulse buy.","<p>&quot; To the Batmobile!&quot; Those words are on a lot of fellow Batman fans and it translates here as the new Batmobile&nbsp;enters the ring thanks to the new movie Dawn of Justice.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box in the back shows the various action sequences made by the set and the front has a nice chase sequence that oviously needed a truck as a better getaway vehicle for those two employees. A neat suprise is the inclusion of a comic book that has some nice twists of how the movie took its course (you won&#39;t be spoiled of the movie).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of grey and black parts make up the Batmobile and the form mirrors that of the Dawn of Justice movie. The set has a spare Batarang and B-man cowl has small ears unlike the DC comics version. The inclusion of stud shooters for the Batmobile and the bazooka&nbsp;works here but not the flick fire as it &nbsp;detracts from the looks of the forklift. Speaking of the Lexcorp vehicle I&#39;d say it has some neat contrasts of green and black (although the part where the cabin collapses is tiresome and is something I changed after building it).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three minifigures are included:&nbsp;Batman, and two generic Lexcorp&nbsp;male employee&nbsp;who are working hard to keep the very exposed&nbsp;Kryptonite cargo away from Batman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Batman who here sports his unarmored suit and two bat-arangs&nbsp;and a darker skin tone that previous B-mans (he may have spent sometime in a tanning salon as I don&#39;t recall Ben Afleck&nbsp;with such skin tone). The cape is from a softer silk that when said element first appeared and it works wonderfully.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two Lexcorp employee have distinct faces and hair styles and it helps to provide some variety to your DC henchmen army builders out there. One of the is made to carry the bazooka to defend against the Batmobile&nbsp;and the other is made to drive the dangerously built forklift.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Construction begins with the forklift and ends with the Batmobile and some neat techniques are used to allow the cabin breaking in the first little model.&nbsp;&nbsp;It then transitions to the Batmobile whose sleek frame is good looking but it leave somethings to be desired (like so many open spaces between corners).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The forklift steals the show here in my opinion and it is a really nice addition to the ever expanding City as it gives you two shadowy employees fighting against Batman and his questionable Batmobile.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a neat set if you are looking to get Batman and a Batmobile at a small price with some extra characters and playfeatures so I think it captures the point. I am not a fan of this particular Batmobile. At $29.99 it&#39;s a great set (more so if you are not a fan who has to own an entire theme and are only looking for variety in your buying).&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get a forklift to populate your City, two generic company workers, Batman and the Batmobile. So you get a few variety here, if I was designing and selling the set I would have included a neat Lexcorp cargo truck and upped the price a bit but that is cool as the set encourages you to make your own stories (make a ship and load said cargo into it or a spaceship that is delivering some shipment to Darkside, use your imagination).&nbsp;</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2017-01-01T22:56:58.66Z","Like my tank you unarmed pedestrians?","<p>Hey everyone, I&#39;m back for another review for brickset. Thankfully a relative got me this set for Christmas. This has been one that I have been wanting for a long time, and I can&#39;t wait to tell you about it. Let&#39;s dive into the review.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong>The box is pretty typical for a set the same size and of the same theme. Oddly enough, the instructions were very folded and i had to use a cooking utensil to hold them down. Other than that, they were pretty easy to follow (I made about 2 errors).</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong>If you are looking for a good parts pack, this set is for you. The cockpit pieces are pretty new, with them only being found in one other set so far. the flowerpot pieces are nice in black, as well as the forklift pieces and a bunch of black parts.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>The minifigures&nbsp;are nice. Batman ha the new spongy cape, as well as the cowl with short ears. The Lexcorp henchmen have unique torsos and relativly rare figures (I&#39;ve heard one is Legolas and the other is Vic Hoskins from Jurassic World). Batman also has dual molded legs, which I love.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>The build is pretty typical for the set. It took me about 2 days to finish. I made two errors, which is really frustrating. However, i fixed those with some help and now I&#39;m here. The forklift was very easy. The batmobile was a bit tricky, but I got the hang of it. The time will vary from person to person. I personally hated the technic parts and the stickers.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed model: &nbsp;</strong>I like the completed model quite a bit. The forklift is simple, but nice. The Batmobile looks wonderful and is one of the best interpretations I&#39;ve ever seen. The bit on the end is a bit fragile, so beware of that.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>I really like the set. The set is really worth the price. You get nice minifgures, good parts and a wonderful completed model. Even though the stickers and technic parts were kind of hard, I really don&#39;t mind that. My only gripe is that the end pieces are a bit fragile. I totally recommend it as a gift or for fun</p>

"RockaRaven","2016-07-10T10:29:24.173Z","Justice has Dawned!","<p>I recently purchased this set, and I do not regret it one bit. Heck, there&#39;s a certain issue that many builders of this set have had, I have not had that at all. Unfortunately however, there was one accidental flaw that I will get into later on this otheriwse perfect set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very well made, design wise, with a design that shows literally everything you need to know. The instructions are very clear, too, something that was not present in the previous Batmobile incarnation from the first LEGO reboot of the superheroes line a few years ago.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are amazing for this kind of set, with a few pieces you wouldn&#39;t expect for this pricepoint. Like the Nexo Knights shield for example. This was my first time using that piece, as well as the new cockpit piece AND the mounted stud launcher pieces, and needless to say I definitely enjoy them all.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure selection in this set is, yet again, top notch. With face prints no longer obtainable in retail sets, it&#39;s a good way to get Vic Hoskins and Legolas&#39; face if you don&#39;t want to shell out too much. I especially like the Batman minifigure in this. Dual molded legs, immaculate detail on the torso. what else do I need? Well,&nbsp;The cape, however, I did not enjoy. Not because I dislike the new cape style, no, as I love that. The reason I did not enjoy it, was because in the box, one of the parts had hitched inside the protective packaging the cape was in-- and ripped the corner of the cape clean off. I&#39;m lucky I have a second batman minifigure with this cape.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very enjoyable, with lots of building techniques I will find myself using in the future. The Low Cost Production Parts (Like blue yellow etc) Are completely covered. People have been saying that the wheel support (That grey slab in the front) Makes the build look a little ugly from the front, however, I like it, simply due to the Batmobile obviously needing to look a little rugged. The forklift is by far one of the best side builds I have ever seen in a set of this price. People have been saying too, that the &#39;glass&#39; shells over the Kryptonite cases keep falling off? Hasn&#39;t done that once for me, it&#39;s a nice, solid atttchment. UR DOIN IT WRONG.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is, well, very complete. I would&#39;ve liked some structure or something to go with it as an added bonus to show the city destruction, but hey, can&#39;t get too greedy, right?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My final opinion on this set is that its a NECESSITY if you want to have a thriving Batman world. I think it works well as both play and display sets, and I prefer this batmobile over the last one. Kudos to ya, LEGO.</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-14T16:21:48.277Z","Do you speed? You will!","<p>Kryptonite Interception is one of the three sets released for Batman v Superman movie. It has 3 figures, 3 builds, and 306 parts.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong>:<br />
1. Batmobile: This is my favorite Batmobile ever made by LEGO. The actual car is an extremely complicated model and the designers have done a fantastic job replicating it in Lego. The entire model is very sturdy. The front has two stud shooters as well as twin cannons on either side. The front two tires are smaller than the back giving the whole vehicle a sleek, low-profile look. There is a pentagonal tile used with a sticker to show the Batsign in dark grey.&nbsp;<br />
The most interesting piece is the canopy which includes two new pieces. The pcs are done in black with tinted curved windows that are very stylized but also accurate. The sides have some greebling which is reminiscent of the 1989 Batmobile. The top of the canopy has hinged plates to create the A design and contains the airbrakes. The inside of the canopy is bare consisting of two 1x4 tiles with stickers. The back is simple as well. The back tires have wings attached to them which is similar to the Tumbler.</p>

<p>2. Lexcorp Forklift: The design is pretty basic but includes a small play feature. The colour scheme is new and looks good on display. The sides have 1x4 stickers saying Lexcorp which are handy for MOCs. The back has a small lever which when activated destroys the back section and sends the henchman flying. Its a fun feature which appears in other sets as well.</p>

<p>3. Kryptonite Canisters: The build consists of a 6x4 brown plate which contains 3 Kryptonite Canisters. There is a black bowl piece which contains a Kryptonite stone and is covered by a transparent dome. The build is simple but effective. The forklift can be used to life the entire assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
1. Batman: The version appears in two sets. The head and cowl and cape are the same as 2015&#39;s Batman but the torso is new. There is the new stretched Batsign as well as the dull gold utility belt. The torso has really cool speck of silver which look fantastic. The legs are dual molded which is nice to get in a cheap set.<br />
Batman comes with 2 silver batarangs</p>

<p>2. and 3. Henchmen 1 and 2: Both henchmens share an exclusive torso. Its a dark green Lexcorp jacket with an ID tag at the front and the name LEXCORP written at the back similar to the stickers on the forklift. Aside from that all the other parts appear elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>:<br />
The set is fantastic. The minifigure selection is a bit dull with only 1 named character but the builds especially the Batmobile is awesome. I bought it for $30 CAD at 33% off MSRP which I felt was justified. At full price the set is not worth it because of the lame figures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>La minifigura protagonista es la de Batman, que cuenta con el dise&ntilde;o de la pel&iacute;cula. El casco o m&aacute;scara&nbsp; es el nuevo introducido en el 2015, lo mismo con la cabeza, que si retiras el casco muestra dos expresiones de Bruce Wayne, una ser&iacute;a y otra m&aacute;s furiosa, est&aacute; muy bien detallado por delante y por detr&aacute;s del torso, y cuenta con piernas de doble molde, que ser&iacute;an perfectas si tuvieran detalle por delante, la capa tiene detalles al final para ser m&aacute;s fiel a Batman, que tiene un batarang por accesorio. Esta figura se encuentra tambi&eacute;n en el set m&aacute;s grande de la pel&iacute;cula.</p>

<p>Las dos minifiguras restantes son empleados de LexCorp, no representan a alguien en espec&iacute;fico en la pel&iacute;cula, tienen un torso igual pero de piernas uno las tiene de color negro y otro de caf&eacute;, el primero tiene la cabeza de Legolas de El Se&ntilde;or de los Anillos y una pieza de cabello hacia atr&aacute;s, mientas que el segundo tiene la misma cabeza que Kraven el Cazador del set 76057 de Spider-Man y una pieza de cabello como la del Joker pero en color negro, adem&aacute;s se le da como accesorio un stud shooter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>La construcci&oacute;n del bat&iacute; m&oacute;vil se ve muy bien y las piezas de arriba de las llantas traseras le dan un aspecto aerodin&aacute;mico, a pesar de tener dos tipos diferentes de llantas (que son fieles al material original) el veh&iacute;culo se mantiene en equilibrio y no raspa con el suelo. Tiene por &ldquo;puertas&rdquo; un par de piezas que tambi&eacute;n se pueden encontrar en el set 76046 en el Batwing y al abrirlas nos muestra el lugar del caballero de la noche en el que tiene que ir algo inclinado pero donde cabe tambi&eacute;n con su batarang, este espacio tiene dos piezas 1x5 con stickers que representan un panel de control, y qu&eacute; tal vez justifican la ausencia de un volante. En la parte frontal hay una pieza con un sticker con el logo de Batman y dos stud shooters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>La construcci&oacute;n secundaria, que viene por parte de los villanos, es un peque&ntilde;o montacargas que funciona a partir de una liga y dos piezas especiales para permitir bajar y subir la carga. Tiene un pieza que hace de cabina y se puede mover hacia arriba y hacia abajo para colocar la minifigura, que con una funci&oacute;n ubicada en la parte de abajo, permite que salga volando junto con la cabina pero se reconstruye muy f&aacute;cilmente . Hay dos stickers en piezas laterales y tambi&eacute;n se encuentran dos proyectiles para detener a Batman.</p>

<p>La peque&ntilde;a carga est&aacute; sobre una pieza 6x4 y se tienen tres contenedores de Kriptonita, est&aacute; construcci&oacute;n se coloca f&aacute;cilmente sobre el montacargas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Una gran figura de Batman junto con su veh&iacute;culo m&aacute;s famoso y un par de malhechores con un veh&iacute;culo que tiene una interesante funci&oacute;n , pueden ser una buena adici&oacute;n para alguien que se enfoque en s&uacute;per h&eacute;roes, pero los stud shooters podr&iacute;an perderse si no se tiene cuidado, pero por $30 d&oacute;lares no est&aacute; nada mal, mencionando tambi&eacute;n que contiene un &ldquo;c&oacute;mic&rdquo; coleccionable.</p>
