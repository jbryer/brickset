<p><strong>Instructions</strong><br />
Two instruction booklets come with the set. The first being approximately 30 pages and the second being 40 pages. The first booklet contains the instructions for Harley Quinn&rsquo;s bike and the second contains the instructions for Batman&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Parts</strong><br />
Both builds contain a fair amount of bricks and Techinc pieces, about 60-40% respectively. Three large wheels come with the set, two used for Batman&rsquo;s bike and one for Harley&#39;s. The sets also contains a fair amount of pearl/warm gold pieces, the fez piece for exhaust pipes and brand new bottom half stud with the peg top (Plate 1X1 W/3.2 Shaft/1.5 Hole) for Deadshot&rsquo;s jetpack.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
The set comes with three minifigures, Deadshot, Harley Quinn and Batman. This is Deadshot&rsquo;s first appearance as a minifigure and Harley&rsquo;s fifth variant.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Deadshot&rsquo;s printing appears to be based off of Daniel LuVisi&rsquo;s famous cover of Secret Six (Vol 3) #15 with the costume taking appearance from that series.&nbsp;<br />
The head and legs are printed on silver metallic with the torso, arms and hip piece on red and yellow hands. The head has single sided printing with the red scope on Deadshot&rsquo;s right eye. A very nice (and needed) touch of the minifigure is the printing on both arms to show of Deadshot&rsquo;s iconic wrist guns along with what looks like extra ammo. The torso, hips and legs are also very detailed showing of the metallic armor underneath Deadshot&rsquo;s red costume. The center of the torso has a target with the printing of his four pouches continuing on down to the hips. These details are also seen on the back torso of the minifigure. The front of the legs also contain some nice detail stopping at the knees where the medium silver is meant to represent his boots. The printing however does not continue onto the sides of the legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
This is Harley Quinn&rsquo;s fifth variant (including the original Batman sets and Dr. Harleen Quinzel) but the first to include her recent red and blue color scheme as seen in the New 52 run of Suicide Squad comics. She makes use of the Zombie Cheerleader hair mold in red. The blue half is printed on quite nicely as it is done so well I originally thought it was dual-molded. This hair piece contains a small hole on the top if one wanted to add a bow or other accessory. She has two face prints, the same ones as her figure in the Jokerland set printed on a white head piece, one smiling and one angry. The printing on the torso is that of her red and blue corset, ammo pouches, and belt. The back continues her corset and belt. She has straps the start from the belt with the printing continuing on down to the hips and legs. The printing on the legs is again only on the front stopping at the knees where the absence of printing is meant to represent her boots. She has white arms with no printing and a red right hand and a blue left hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Batman is the same minifigure that has come in a plethora of sets with his New 52 design. Not much else can be said about this minifigure that hasn&rsquo;t been said already. This version does not come with a pair of dual-molded boots which seem to be exclusive to more expensive sets like Jokerland and Sky High Battle.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The Build</strong><br />
The build is split into two motorcycles for Batman and Harley Quinn with some pieces going to Deadshot&rsquo;s jetpack and gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The jetpack is a simple but effective build using the basic neck-stud piece connected to a motorcycle handle with clips for the jet boosters. His gun is what I think meant to be a bazooka due to its length. It is built around a 5-sided studded brick with a stud shooter in the front, pistol on the bottom and clear cheese slope on top meant to be a scope.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Both motorcycle builds are built similarly. Both are about six studs wide with Harley&rsquo;s falling two studs shorter in comparison with Batman&rsquo;s.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Harley&rsquo;s bike strangely has the larger wheel in the front, not common in motorcycles. The blue and red match her minifigure color scheme and properly distinguish this as her vehicle. Like the build for the Batbike the front tire is connected on one side with the other simply put in place by the rotating L shaped Techinc beams on a black pin. The bike also has two different ways of holding Harley&#39;s hammer, one to move up and down and the other side to side.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The Batbike appears to be inspired by the Dark Knight&rsquo;s Batpod. Similar in design Batman does not sit on it but instead holds on horizontally with the majority of his front facing down. The same black, grey, yellow and trans-orange color scheme is used like the majority of Batman&rsquo;s vehicles. The main play feature of this build is the two stud shooters connected to the arm of a ball and joint feature. This makes for easy access to move and pose the shooters either backwards, to the side or forwards. The also each have a clip to hold Batman&rsquo;s Batarangs or grappling gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Model or Toy</strong><br />
This set is first and foremost a toy like most $20 Super Hero builds. The two bikes roll smoothly on a flat surface and play features like Harley&#39;s hammer and stud-shooters make this another great and low priced set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
This is a good set for collectors but not a great one. Kids will have fun rolling their two vehicles around on the floor but as display sets, they are just fine. In my personal opinion whenever a smaller set like this is divided up into two builds it takes away from the overall quality of the set. Although for this set there is a good balance. The two new minifigures will be this sets greatest draw for any DC fan. Also it is great to see a female villain get her own built vehicle.<br />
As the Suicide Squad movie comes closer I can see the want for this set to increase greatly as it contains two of the main characters from the film with other characters coming in the summer wave.&nbsp;<br />
Although I said this set wasn&rsquo;t great for collectors, I do strongly recommend getting it. The builds aren&rsquo;t groundbreaking but the piece count and exclusive minifigures make it worth its retail price.&nbsp;</p>

"Turtlemoht","2016-04-01T06:49:45.59Z","Too dang big for the little minifigures","<p>I picked up this set for the figures, but overall, I can&rsquo;t recommend it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing unusual here. The art is great, but that&rsquo;s standard for Lego, and the size is what you&rsquo;d expect for a set of this piece count.<br />
The instructions come in two books which seems a little unnecessary. I always prefer one bound volume if possible.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t a parts pack by any means, though you do get three large tires, which is nice. Also, each of the wheels is connected by an unusual right-angled beam with a hole (http://brickset.com/parts/6019986).<br />
Lastly, the new &lsquo;grapple gun&rsquo; piece is included, along with pearl grey batarang pieces that were introduced with the Dawn of Justice sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three in the set and they&rsquo;re a mixed bag.<br />
What I consider &lsquo;standard&rsquo; Batman is included. This is the version with the new cowl, soft cape and nicely detailed torso in grey. I have many of this version through the Justice League sets from last year, and while it&rsquo;s a very common figure, it&rsquo;s also a great version of &lsquo;comic book&rsquo; Batman.<br />
These days the Dawn of Justice versions are my favorite on detail alone but this version isn&rsquo;t bad, just not quite as good.<br />
Next is Harley Quinn. To finally get her in a set that I could afford was what sold me on the set and this version is a nice alternative to the traditional jester suit.<br />
Looking like a cross between the Suicide Squad movie and Arkham City versions, I like the dual-coloured hair and inverse red and blue outfit. I also like the oversize hammer that&rsquo;s included as a weapon.<br />
Lastly there&rsquo;s Deadshot. This is a character I&rsquo;ve not read much about but I did encounter the guy in Arkham City- or was it Origins? I can&rsquo;t recall. Either way, for a stealthy sniper character, the bright red suit seems a little&hellip; strange. I guess it&rsquo;s consistent with various images I&rsquo;ve seen of the guy but I find it a bit gaudy.<br />
He comes with a vastly oversized launcher gun that is acceptable, though most large weapons look comedic when carried by little Lego people.<br />
All up, the figures are good. Lego knew what they were doing with the roster here.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The thing that surprised me about the build was how similar the two bikes are. Both have a nearly identical core structure onto which the front and back wheels are attached with three pins.<br />
There&rsquo;s some nice work in the detailing, particularly the exhaust pipes on Harley&rsquo;s bike and the adjustable tool racks on Batman&rsquo;s, but they&rsquo;re pretty basic overall.<br />
I also like the colour work on Harley&rsquo;s bike, alternating red and blue pieces to match her outfit.<br />
The bikes are both (essentially) left/right symmetrical so there&rsquo;s really nothing exciting here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The elephant in the room is the scale. These bikes are just too dang big. They&rsquo;re six studs wide, meaning they&rsquo;re as wide, and much longer than most standard cars in the City line, and the figures are simply dwarfed by them.<br />
I almost immediately retired Harley&rsquo;s bike for parts, whereas I&rsquo;m keeping Batman&rsquo;s around because I&rsquo;m convinced I could do a better, smaller, job with the same parts...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is sadly a bit forgettable. The figures are nice, and we&rsquo;re unlikely to see Deadshot again for many years, but the builds just seem nuts. The techniques are dull and the results aren&rsquo;t in keeping with the scale of the figures. I know bikes are hard at minifigure scale but, without changing the piece count, this set could have been a sleek (and small) bat-pod with a more substantial car or truck for Harley.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-15T21:57:55.18Z","Decidedly Weak Offering.","<p><strong>Set #76053 Batman: Gotham City Cycle Chase:</strong> Suicide Squad does not get dedicated sets based on the film like BvS, however LEGO still manages to find a way to give us the characters in some fun looking sets from 2016, and this one is the cheapest.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: Racing through Gotham City Harley Quinn and Batman have some large looking motorcycles according to the action shot on the front of this box. The back shows some of the features, what few there are, plus some more fun shots for telling a story with this set.</p>

<p>Instructions: For a set this small it is unusual to receive numbered manuals, however since there are two models in the set it seems that LEGO has decided to separate the two models by both manuals. There are two numbered bags and each one has their own manual, with easy to follow steps, as the building isn&rsquo;t too involved for these models unfortunately.</p>

<p>There are a few stickers for the details here, and of course the usual cross-promotional elements at the back of the second manual. What is interesting to note is that there is no included comic for this set, which is usually not seen in a LEGO DC Super Heroes set, at least at this price point.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The parts unfortunately aren&rsquo;t much to talk about, the biggest element in this set that would interest folks is the Dalek eyestalk piece, there&rsquo;s four of them in the set. A fairly disappointing set for parts in my honest opinion compared to other Super Heroes sets.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Batman: Your standard Batman really, I don&rsquo;t think this guy has anything unique about him as far as the print or anything else. His accessories however are new, the Batarang is in a new dark silver colour and they look great. Also the new softer cape material is a real improvement over the stiffer models.</p>

<p>Deadshot: When LEGO makes a set that focuses on the Minifigures over the models this is what you get. Some awesome looking accessories are included with him, a jetpack and a massive gun with a stud launcher on the end of it. His printing is very detailed as well with some great side-arm printing, everything goes together to capture the likeness of Deadshot in his full costume. This is one of a rare handful of licensed characters that has standard LEGO yellow for his hands, obviously these are gloves, but because of this you can fit him in to any LEGO City or regular Minifigure themed collection and he wouldn&rsquo;t look as out of place as other licensed characters.</p>

<p>Harley Quinn: This variant of Harley is obviously inspired by, though not quite emulating, Suicide Squad. She&rsquo;s got the same colour scheme, but is dressed in decidedly a lot more clothing compared to her on-screen counterpart from the movie. She&rsquo;s wearing a red and blue leather corset with some small sheaths on it. I believe for small throwing daggers. Her legs have some minor printing to match the red and blue colour of the opposite leg, plus also a few straps attached to her belt. Her head is a dual-sided print with some great facial expressions, one happy the other angry. For accessories she can take the hammer that is attached to the bike, but other than that doesn&rsquo;t have any officially as the hammer is meant more to stay with the bike from what I can see. Her hair piece is great though, and cast in two different colours, which is pretty rare, and looks awesome.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Bag 1: The design choices for these models has made the builds really disappointing, there is a lot of large pieces being used in the builds instead of smaller parts for better detailing and the models are so overscaled compared to the Minifigures that they look too big and are built up too big. The build is at least simple enough to follow and construct, there are no tricky or difficult moments and that is again, because the designs are so lackluster.</p>

<p>Bag 2: Batman&rsquo;s build is slightly better than Harley&rsquo;s, because this design is very evocative of the Batpod from The Dark Knight Rises, the build relies too heavily on oversized elements and technic parts unfortunately, however the look is at least more like a dangerous weapon of the road that Batman can use, and the build is a quick, easy to follow one that is a bit funner compared to Harley&rsquo;s, which is greatly unfortunate.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Harley&rsquo;s Bike: To be perfectly honest neither of these bikes are very interesting or enjoyable, compared to what we&rsquo;ve gotten in the past from this Theme these two vehicles are lacking a lot in the design because they are too big, too Technic inspired and just look overall terrible. Harley&rsquo;s bike is the worst of the two offenders though, because it looks more like someone took the body of a car (as she sits down to steer) and attached a few exhaust pipes and two giant tires and called it a day. She&rsquo;s got a hammer on a clip joint that can swing out to strike someone beside her, really though it is painfully obvious this set was designed around the Minifigures first instead of making decent models to compliment the figures.</p>

<p>Batman&rsquo;s Bike: Batman&rsquo;s bike is a much better model and at least looks like a vehicle, the tires and basic look are far too big, but it is a pretty blatant attempt at making a Minifigure scaled Bat Pod, even the play features are inspired by it, though you can&rsquo;t spin the wheels around like the Bat Pod did, there are two side arms attached with stud launchers that can be aimed in front of, in behind of and to the sides of the main body, to deal with any adversaries on the road. And at least Batman drives it properly, by leaning forward and grabbing the control bar.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say this is a bit of a disappointing set, the only real draw in my opinion outside of the Minifigures is the Minifigure scaled Bat Pod that was created, Harley&rsquo;s vehicle is terrible, and overall this set is definitely not worth the asking price of 25$ compared to some of the earlier sets made in this price point. Last year had a decent Green Lantern inspired set, for 2016 we&rsquo;ve only gotten this set so far in this price range and it&rsquo;s just lackluster all around where the models come from. I&rsquo;d recommend bricklinking half of it instead, as the Bat Pod isn&rsquo;t too bad, and if you want the Minifigures it&rsquo;s probably better than wasting money on the parts for Harley&rsquo;s bike, which is just terrible. Safe to skip if you want.</p>

"Hashem1983","2016-05-30T12:07:23.473Z","A Bit Oversized But Amazing!!!!!","<p>I saw this set from one of our local online shopping websites, it had a nice offer from where I live, and I cannot deny that I did like the set since the first time I saw the pictures, though a bit oversized yet its a fun an an amzing&nbsp;set.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is mid-sized, the front of it has the DC Comics Super Heroes Label with an image of Batman &amp; Harley cycling on the street and Deadshot&nbsp;is&nbsp;aiming with his big gun or bazooka on Batman,&nbsp;&nbsp;as for&nbsp;the back it displays the set with its features having Batman &amp; Harley Quinn cycling in&nbsp;front of each other and Deadshot&nbsp;flying with his jet&nbsp;pack towards Batman aiming at him.</p>

<p>It comes with 2 instruction booklets, the first one for Harley Quinn&#39;s&nbsp;bike and second for Batman.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Is Pink a cheap color Brick?????&nbsp;I was surprised that there were two 2X4 bricks in pink, though it is not visible&nbsp;on the build and its used as a base on both cycles, still it was strange.</p>

<p>A lot of the parts in this sets are new to ME or shall I say new to my collection mostly the Technic pieces like the round black disks that are used on Batman&#39;s pod, the Beams and the tubes are new addition to ME. You also get 4 of the Golden fez that are used on Harley Quinn&#39;s&nbsp;bike as an exhaust but sadly you don&#39;t get a spare part of it unlike the golden plate with the hole&nbsp;in the middle you get 2 spare parts in this set.</p>

<p>Basically some of the old pieces are new addition to my parts collection and it&nbsp;also has some nice amount of spare parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Batman</strong>: My second Batman minifiguer&nbsp;since my latest one from set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76044-1/Clash-of-the-Heroes"">76044</a>, he comes in dark bluish&nbsp;grey with nice torso details from the front and back, no leg printing, Nice soft fabric for the cape, as for the mask the chin guard is removed and the ears are shorter. He has double sided face, a serious face and an angry face, he holds a grappling hook &quot;but does not shoot&quot; and a Bat&nbsp;Boomerang Wing in metallic silver &quot;a spare part is included&quot;.<br />
<br />
<strong>Harley Quinn</strong>: Colorful and Nicely detailed minifiguer, I like the detailed prints on the torso &quot;Front &amp; Back&quot; also the legs are printed, the color harmony between the red and blue is nice. The hair piece is beautifully crafted and beautifully printed on the other half with blue, there is a hole in it to add a bow or a princess crown or any kind of girly accessory, but beware she might get angry at you. Speaking of angriness, she has double sided face print with an evil laugh and an angry face, I loved the details on the eyes by using&nbsp;the eye-shadow around it, it gave it a nice unique detail.</p>

<p><strong>Deadshot</strong>: I don&#39;t know anything about this character so forgive my ignorance, however this is the&nbsp;most detailed minifiguer or the most one that has prints, no double sided face as he has no head gear accessory or hair, the head is a metallic silver and the right eye has a red lense or let me just say like the character&nbsp;Kano from Mortal Kombat, no face details, nice print detailed torso, front and back, even the arms has some prints on it, the legs are also printed. He has a nice buildable machine gun or a bazooka and has a nice simple build&nbsp;jet pack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;""><b>The Build</b></span></p>

<p>Though both cycles are identical in the building techniques, however the detailing are different. I won&#39;t say an easy build but its definitely not that difficult.</p>

<p>Harley Quinn&#39;s bike is a bit shorter than Batman&#39;s due to the usage&nbsp;of one big tire and one small, while Batman&#39;s cycle uses two big tires.</p>

<p>The construction starts with the middle body of the cycle and there where you use the Pink Brick, then it starts detailing it to which character this cycle is for and then you start building the front and the Back of the cycle.</p>

<p>With Harley&#39;s bike it has the color mix of Red and Blue, the 4 exhausts on the back, the buildable hammer which sadly it could be added only on her right side, I wish the cycle&nbsp;was constructed to be able to use the hammer on either left or right side, either way I did it. The Buildable Hammer was nice and it has two stickers to add on, my favorite the one with the &quot;POW!!&quot;</p>

<p>The Detailing on Batman&#39;s bike is different, this time the cycle is build to make Batman lean on it instead of sitting on it.&nbsp;On the sides of the body you get to stick the Batman logo stickers. As for the back, it has a nice turbo engine and on the sides the Plate stud shooters that you can rotate them front, back and even up, also you could hook the&nbsp;Bat&nbsp;Boomerang Wing and the grappling hook on the other side.&nbsp;As for&nbsp;the color harmony its mixed with black, grey and yellow to have its classic look.</p>

<p>In general, I do enjoy building whatever the set is.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Generally I liked it, though its a bit over sized, especially for Batman, I get Harley&#39;s having one small and one big Tire to give some kind of a comic feel to it. Batman is a bit oversized for a minifiguer but in the end its a fun as a play set as you get Batman &amp; Harley with the aid of Deadshot chase each other, however I may prefer to have Batman in a seating position rather than leaning but I guess it will make both cycles&nbsp;similar than it already is.</p>

<p>I also loved the idea of having a buildable weapon or accessory than having a special mold for it, like the Hammer, Deadshot&#39;s Bazooka and Jetpack,&nbsp;this will allow kids to think and create things from their own imaginations without relying on a special crafted item, it may look bulky but creative in the same time.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;""><b>Overall opinion</b></span></p>

<p>This is my Second set of DC Comics Super Heroes and I quite like it, I cannot complain, it is a nice collection to my Lego sets, its not a bad set but not a great one, I could rate it a bit below than great.</p>

<p>For me I could use it as a display as I don&#39;t mind or even play with it, Fan Kids will love chasing around and rolling over the wheels, has great figures and nice collection for parts.</p>
