<br />
The grappler parts contained within this Service Pack can be found in sets such as the Launch and Load Seaport (6542) or the Freight Loading Station (4555). The grappler parts included in this set are designed to grapple containers that are 4 studs in width - no good if you're hoping to use this set with the larger containers included in set 7994 (LEGO City Harbour)<br />
<br />
In any case, the parts in this Service Pack most builders should find that the parts in this pack are useful when constructing cranes. <br />
