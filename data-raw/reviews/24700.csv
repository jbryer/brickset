I will go into detail and conclude if this set is worth getting by the end of this review.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set includes two minifigures, Batman and Catwoman. Both figures have short black legs and minimal prining on their torsos and heads. You get Batman&#39;s newer cowl piece that has no chin and Catwoman&#39;s&nbsp;regular mask piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figs have no alternate expressions but the belt printing does carry to the back. Another thing to note is that Batman&#39;s cape is the&nbsp;size&nbsp;that Batman usually gets&nbsp;and it made of the new cloth material. Some accessories include a carton of milk and a diamond&nbsp;for Catwoman, and a Batarang for Batman.</p>

<h3>The Builds</h3>

<p>The two models we get in this set are both very nice, and I will first talk about the mini Batmobile we get.</p>

<p>The Batmobile&nbsp;uses&nbsp;the new chasis&nbsp;piece (http://brickset.com/parts/6134236)&nbsp;and the new black fender piece (http://brickset.com/parts/6134235)&nbsp;to sculpt this model easier. It has two different sets of wheels while&nbsp;the back ones are wider. It uses yellow rims to match Batman&#39;s color scheme. On the front it has two headlights, a &nbsp;grill, and a 1x2 printed cheese-slope with the Batman insignia on it. Just above that it has a trans-grey windshield and a yellow steering wheel. In the cockpit it has only two studs to fit Batman. The back of the car slopes up to make the signature bat wing effect that has been used on several of Lego&#39;s batmobiles.&nbsp;On the back there are&nbsp;two backlights and a rocket booster. This is a fun vehicle and I&nbsp;picture it as a mini batpod for one of the Batmobile&nbsp;sets.</p>

<p>Now onto Catwoman&#39;s vehicle. Her model is built up the same way Batman&#39;s vehicle is except the fender piece is now purple. The wheels are the same but now are light bluish-grey. The front of the model has two headlights and a 1x2 half pyramid as I&#39;m going to call it (http://brickset.com/parts/6143953) with cat eyes printed onto it. Then two cheese-slopes make cat ears above the front part of the vehicle. Purple slopes decorate the sides and connect to a purple spoiler in the back. On the back is&nbsp;a black elephant trunk element used as a cat tail and two trans-orange cone pieces used as flames shooting out of the exhaust.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a pretty good set with some okay minifigures. This set is definitely&nbsp;the weakest of the DC Superheroes Mighty Micros&nbsp;vehicles, being more plain and not as wacky as the other four. The price is pretty cheap but the price per part is still a bit steep, at 12.6 cents a piece. This line is targeted mainly towards kids, so if you are a kid or teen you will probably enjoy this set. Adults might like this set if they are a serious superheroes collector or if they need some of the useful pieces this set includes. I enjoy and own all of the DC Mighty Micros and I am looking forward to a possible Series 2.&nbsp;</p>
