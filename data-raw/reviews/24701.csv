<p>https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsb80_mgl-MGx3lBPDnln3g</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>the box is small. the same goes for the instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>not many parts. most of them are small.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>comes with 2 minifigures, Robin and Bane. Robin comes wit ha grappling hook and Bane comes with a stick of dynamite.&nbsp;their legs are short, like the legs for the lego children.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the build itself was very short. well, i guess you can tell that its short, because just look at how small the cars are!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>the completed model looked amazing. robins car is just fine, and banes driller is a bit more nostalgic. can you guess why? Yes! Banes&nbsp;driller looks just like a mini thunder driller!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>the set is nice. really wish that there whould be more buildings like dunno, a demolishable house or somethin&#39;. but what can i say, im impressed by this little set!</p>
