<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a small box, and includes 2 instruction booklets, one for each vehicle.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set really has some fantastic parts! Like a&nbsp;snowboard, Ninjago swords, and many other cool little pieces that are fun to have. I really think even if you don&#39;t like the vehicles, you could get it for the minifigs, and the cool pieces would make up for it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Both minifigures have short legs, which I personally don&#39;t like, but it&#39;s nice to get short legs in different colors anyway. The Flash has really nice, simple printing that is&nbsp;very fun, and feels comic book-y in a great way. The Flash&#39;s mask is the same one from previous sets, so it is unfortunately made of rubber, which does get looser over time. Hopefully it has improved and won&#39;t end up like a previous Flash figure a relative of mine owns. Captain Cold is also fun, same cool comic book-y style that I love. I just wish I had full-size legs in that color... The accesories are awesome too! A sweet can of soda for Flash, with nice printing on both pieces! And for Cold, an ice cream cone and a freeze gun. The soda is a really fun touch, representing Flash&#39;s need for constant energy, and of course, ice cream is great for Cold.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The builds are very fun. No crazy new building trchniques or anything, but it&#39;s fun to see it come together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed models are&nbsp;great! I can&#39;t even decide which one I like better! I like how Cold has an adorable little snowmobile, and Flash has Ninjago swords or whatever they are to represent him speeding (He&#39;s gonna break the speed limit).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have decided I love Mighty Micros! This is the only one that really caught my eye in the first wave, but, so long as whoever designed this one is designing&nbsp;more,&nbsp;this is a sub-theme to watch!</p>

"jnette","2016-06-05T22:16:57.437Z","Flash vs Captain Cold for the win!","<p>I was super excited when I saw this set. I love Flash. He is one of my favorite DC superheroes. He is well depicted in this set along with his villain Captain Cold.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong> The Box image is fun and gets your attention with it&#39;s action and colors. The instructions are one sheet front and back. The paper could be thicker, especially when one intends to keep the instructions for future use.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong> I don&#39;t normally like the easy pieces were the parts are added as one full molded piece. But in this case the outer hull of Flash&#39;s car works well in this fashion. All of the pieces are good quality and there are a few special pieces. Like the flames from Flash&#39;s car, his pop can with a flat piece to look like the tab of a can &lt; very cool. Captain Cold&#39;s gun makes use of some normal pieces along with a special piece for &nbsp;the base of the gun.&nbsp;&nbsp;Making an&nbsp;interesting weapon to zap Flash with in order to gain the lead in the Mighty Micros race!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong> &nbsp;Flash&#39;s mask is rubber and the color and paint could be better. The red of&nbsp;the mask and his costume don&#39;t match so well and the lightning bolts look a muddy yellow. But I can repaint them myself.&nbsp;Captain Cold on the other hand is perfect. Looks great in color and detail.He&#39;s ready for action!</p>

<p>Both minifigs have short legs, the ones used for Hobbits and Lego children. The height&nbsp;gives the right scale to the cars. So the short legs makes sense with this in thought.</p>

<p><strong>The build:</strong> Quick and easy. It took me well under ten minutes to build. Though there was some oohing&nbsp;and ahing&nbsp;of parts and pieces somewhere in&nbsp;between. :p&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model: </strong>I&#39;m an adult collector and&nbsp;I even had fun zipping the cars around. Anything to relieve the stress of life. Lego makes it all good, it&#39;s fun, nostalgic, and works the brain and hands to keep muscles healthy and the mind learning for all ages. :)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion: </strong>This is a really great and simple set. A bit high in price, just a bit, being that each car with figure is about $5 each. But the special pieces and two figures make up for that very well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was unsure about the Mighty Micros at first. A bit silly and some of the set pairings were disappointing. But there is a huge collect-ability factor here, which makes it all come together. Next up in my collection will be Batman vs.&nbsp;Catwoman. I have other older superhero Lego figures so the newer ones&nbsp;all fit in well. Lego does a pretty good job keeping all of the superheroes in a uniformed look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happy Building!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I really like the box of this set. It&rsquo;s got nice a cartoon look to it and it&rsquo;s very colorful, red, blue, yellow. The background is very cartoon looking with the blue, almost wiggly, looking buildings. It includes 88 pieces. The sides of the box are a solid black color.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jrk8uaknn/Untitled_9.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>The back of the box has a small fight between Flash and Captain Cold and below&nbsp;there&rsquo;s what looks like an&nbsp;old film reel with pictures of the other Mighty Micros sets. The instructions were much smaller then I expected, similar to the ones that&nbsp;they used for&nbsp;PolyBags. It comes with two instructions, one for each build.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5mefshbmb/Untitled_10.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t tons of pieces in this set, mostly red and blue, But there are some newly printed pieces. First of which is Flash&rsquo; soda can. It&rsquo;s a lime green cylinder with the words: Power Bolt surrounded in purple bubbles.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/b471ga6tv/Untitled_5.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>It is printed on NOT a sticker, neither is the top of the soda can. It may appear like a sticker but it is not. And the Flash symbol on the red roof tile is NOT a sticker. In fact this set does not include stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5u22ozmkz/Untitled_6.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I really like these minifigures, they&#39;re just like the original minifigures but much more cartoon and almost baby like. With the shorty legs. I especially like this Flash minifigure.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/evc0ouv4j/Untitled_1.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>But the ones in the past I was very disappointed. I got the Riddler Chase set with&nbsp;high expectations and I was very disappointed,the reason being, his mask because it was made of rubber the yellow bolts on the sides of his mask rubbed away revealing red.&nbsp;His head&nbsp;later&nbsp;did the same thing. With this set I do not think it will rub away. It hasn&rsquo;t scratched at all. But we&rsquo;ll see. Now Captain Cold.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5c6x94x03/Untitled_2.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think is excellent minifigure, with the sand blue and white hood, and his torso and legs are also sand blue. His torso printing is a bit simple as well as Flash, but I think it suits them well for the cartoon look.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The builds were very simple but still super fun to build. For the base of most the Mighty Micros builds LEGO used a new piece.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/yz08encib/Untitled_8.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>I really liked Flash&rsquo;s car.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/yh52ysmxf/Untitled_4.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>It looks so sleek and race car like and I know some people did not like the swords on the back. But I do, it makes it look like it&rsquo;s speeding and theres a blur behind it. However it can get annoying at times, and can be easily removed. The&nbsp;snow plow/ tractor is very cleverly built,</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ujht9e043/Untitled_3.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>however the blue vents on the front of the tractor are very annoying, they can very easily pop off. But other than that it&rsquo;s a great build. And I love the snow board plow. Over all I really enjoyed these builds.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>These models are so fun and so well built and so nice to look at I could just stare at it all day! Okay maybe not, but they are very, very nice models.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Over all, this was a great set and I would recommend getting it.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s one of the best Mighty Micros sets to get first. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>&gt;&gt; The Minifigures.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; The Builds.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; The Soda Can.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Ice Cream Cone. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Freeze Gun.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; Printing Instead Of Stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<p>&gt;&gt; Flash&rsquo;s Mask</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; The Blue Vents</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
