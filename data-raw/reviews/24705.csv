Lego isn&rsquo;t the only toy-related hobby in my life and I did fall foul of the sickly cute &lsquo;Palace Pet&rsquo; toys back on their release in 2013.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Blissfully, the Lego mould for Cinderella&rsquo;s dog Pumpkin doesn&rsquo;t follow the concept design where the poor thing is wearing earrings. It&rsquo;s delightful to know that the Lego Disney Princesses, whilst suffering from the usual minidoll bows-on-everything disease, don&rsquo;t mutilate their animals for the sake of some added bling! (We will stick a &ndash;new [-ish, it&rsquo;s cropped up previously in the Arendelle Castle] &ndash; tiara on her, but welcome to Disney folks.) I would strongly recommend Pumpkin avoids further visits to 41140 Daisy&rsquo;s Beauty Salon however &ndash; it seems that Rapunzel&rsquo;s mischievous Maltese has added blue dye to the water! For a white canine, Pumpkin is sporting an awful lot of blue fur. Although elsewhere a few of her incarnations have styled out a fluffy blue tail, I cannot fathom the decision behind that Sky-Blue Donald-Trump!</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">So, outside of the target audience of giddy young children and the closeted adult Palace Pet collector, what is there for an AFOL here? Honestly, I was surprised by the number of yummy new pieces. Keeping in mind this is an &pound;8.99 set we&rsquo;re talking about too. The tiara piece is new for me and immediately disappeared off to add some variety to a minifigures&rsquo; shop window display (alternative tops for perfume bottoms, vastly improving their apparent product range). We see the &lsquo;Modified 1 x 2 x 1 2/3 with Studs on 1 Side&rsquo; in light bluish grey in a handful of other 2016 sets, the two included here although admittedly in Dark Pink, but it&rsquo;s still a good deal to get your paws on these new SNOT pieces. Plus, there isn&rsquo;t a sticker in sight, that silver paw motif on the six carriage slopes is a print, so if you&rsquo;ve ever had aspirations for a pretty high-end pet store awning in baby blue? I know what my next MOC is going to be! </font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">As a whole, the set blends nicely in amongst the other Cinderella Disney pieces. It&rsquo;s sat quite happily on my shelf for now, although it has been divested of Pumpkin temporarily. If you&rsquo;re thinking the blue dog won&rsquo;t fit outside of the Disney theme, I have to add she looks enchanting fleshing out a fantasy forest with critters. Sure, she looks cute and defenceless &ndash; and, yes, an obvious fit amongst the Elves critters - but pop her on a stack of bones outside a trolls&rsquo; castle with some heavily sweating knights tentatively approaching? Do not mess with Blue Trump Pup!</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">That said, whilst I have enjoyed mucking about with this charming little set, I am conscious of the play factor. Pumpkin can pootle about in her (Self-driving? Telekinetically-powered?) carriage or shelter in her grandiose dog house. She can have a sniffle of her flower, savage open her letter with those over-sized paws and smiling maw, drink from her jolly heart fountain... But this isn&#39;t going to satisfy anyone as a stand-alone. As a top-up play set, it&#39;s excellent. If the new Cinderella Juniors, or previously released&nbsp;carriage/castle sets are about, this is a perfect addition... But independently, even for&nbsp;the most&nbsp;animal-loving child, you will need to team it with something else if roleplaying playtime is on the agenda. Then again, what do I know at 25? Perhaps this telekinetic carriage talks and that will be sufficient for hours of adventuring up and down the dangerous terrain of the enchanted staircase and the mystical plain of the&nbsp;living room&nbsp;floor, one dog and her paw-some carriage!&nbsp;</font></p>
