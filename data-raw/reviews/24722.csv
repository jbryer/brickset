You also get a baby dragon and a nice dragon egg which is taller than a mini-doll. Prepare to hatch baby Fledge with Emily in this wonderfully enchanting little set.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: This tiny box is similar to the past LEGO Elves boxes, however for year two adds a brand new piece of artwork on the side which features the Dragons, or at least Emily&rsquo;s personal dragon along the side in young and fully grown form. The set looks great on the front and for the back you get to see the few features in the model and another great piece of artwork with all the dragons.</p>

<p>Instructions: The instruction manual leads you through the build efficiently and without any issues. The back of the book is where you&rsquo;ll find a lot of impressive artwork for year two of LEGO Elves, including the evil Ragana&hellip; And all of the dragons are showcased as is the first assortment of sets from the year. All-in-all good instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set, like most Elves sets, has tones of fun parts in unique colours. The stand out parts for me though are the new dragon egg pieces in a rich dark purple and a lime green donut piece, most of the rest of the pieces aren&rsquo;t as unique as we&rsquo;ve seen them before in past Elves sets.</p>

<p><strong>Minidoll</strong></p>

<p>Emily Jones: This is Emily Jones from year two, with an exclusive printed torso showing the locket and a deep dark blue top with some sort of dot pattern on her waist/stomach. Her legs are the newer cargo shorts from LEGO Friends dolls in the Jungle and she&rsquo;s wearing red sneakers. For accessories she includes a printed tile that resembles a chocolate bar and a basket full of cherries. Emily&rsquo;s hair is also unique to her with places for bows and other accessories, overall a great new Mini-Doll.</p>

<p>Fledge: The baby wind dragon is a brand new piece in a nice lavender colour with darker purple colouring for the wings and tuft of scales on top of her head&hellip;I assume it&rsquo;s a her, haven&rsquo;t seen the webisodes with this theme in it yet.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build for this set is extremely fun, you get to construct this fun little nook in a tree or something by what I&rsquo;m assuming is a mystical stream or small lake of some kind. There aren&rsquo;t any difficult steps in the model so the build is relatively quick and easy, the large egg piece sits nicely on a &lsquo;Dragon Nest&rsquo; looking thing and building it gives you a sense of wonder.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>This is a relatively small model, and it features only one real play feature, turn a small technic axle (covered by a clear pink cylinder piece) and you can make Fledge hop off the flowing water from the flowing river. (Or brook.) It just looks brilliant though with all the clear bricks in rose and the little tree where magical cherries grow, this is just a fun little model that matches with other LEGO Elves sets and stands out as extremely impressive in the design.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I really recommend picking this set up, you get Emily Jones, Fledge the Baby Wind Dragon and an awesome looking little model. You can&rsquo;t do much with it, however it will got quite nicely with all of the larger sets in the wave. As a bonus this is a really cheap way of getting the main human character from this Theme with a simply gorgeous outfit design. The new crystal dragon eggs are also highly desirable for fans of unique pieces with huge potential.</p>

<p>I really felt the &quot;training feature&quot; was very underwhelming, I wish there was more than the wobbly lillypad platform for fledge to &quot;hop down quickly&quot;.</p>

<p>Over all a decent set that I&#39;d recommend to the fans of the line.</p>
