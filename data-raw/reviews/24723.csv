<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Cheaper price! Granted at MSRP it is still a cheaper Dragon set and a reasonable price for what you get, the fact that you can find it as less than MSRP almost everywhere, I would highly recommend it.</p>

<p>- Dragon has good articulation. All 4 legs, wings, tail and head move! You can have it soar through the air or have it sitting on it&#39;s hind end waiting for a treat.</p>

<p>- The scenery actually adds a lot to the little set. The designer did a good job with the tree/small waterfall. And there are a few small play features including a catapult and hidden binoculars behind the crystals.</p>

<p>- Great use of colors with the tree. The lime and magenta seem to go together quite well.</p>

<p>- My daughter actually still has this set built! That&#39;s a feat. She usually breaks things down to build others, but she still uses this to play out some storylines she has in her head.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- Surprisingly, my biggest complaint is the MSRP. It&#39;s a fine value, but I always like spending less.</p>

<p>- The set itself actually is near flawless. Of course, more foliage is always appreciated, especially in these bright colors, but this is typical of most LEGO sets.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; Depending on which way you look at it, but having a bright blue dragon vs something more &quot;natural&quot; looking can be a CON for some people. But I rather like it and the dragon fits Naida&#39;s color scheme well.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>I look at this set as a gateway set because it is my belief that once you pick up one dragon you will want each version to complete the series. But if you only get one, this is an affordable way to add a dragon to your collection or playtime. I highly recommend the set, especially if you can find it under MSRP.</p>

To her the dragon was majestic and all though being small and her having the much larger Queen Elandra dragon she played with the water dragon so much more.</p>

<p>From more of a A.F.O.L. perspective the shrubbery that really does help bring Elvendale to life is very much present with the shrine as a smaller but just as good to me build.</p>

<p>Overall a good set that is good for play and parts with all the shrubbery. Deffinately recommend to all.</p>
