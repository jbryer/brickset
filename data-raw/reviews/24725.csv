It is aimed at younger females, but as an adult male, I can still understand and appreciate what these sets bring. Especially this one. It has more function than some of the sets and can be incorporated into a larger medieval setting, if desired.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Overall look of the set is top notch. It feels like an inn somewhere in the forest. I could easily picture this being a castle themed set with some different colors and play features.</p>

<p>- Printed windows! Those add a nice touch and I thank LEGO for printing them. Stickers would be too cloudy thanks to all of the fingerprints. These will come in handy in other MOCs too.</p>

<p>- Even though it is called the Starlight Inn (which makes sense when you see the telescope), I really like the sleeping dragon sign. It adds that little touch of whimsy the Elves sets are all about.</p>

<p>- The viewing platform with the telescope is neat. I like how the tree spins to reveal the ladder to get up there.</p>

<p>- The bedroom is fun, although really small. The bed has a hidden drawer which adds another play feature.</p>

<p>- The chair design is simple, yet effective. You could easily switch out the round tile for a different setting.</p>

<p>- The cellar adds an external build for more play value. I like the new lavender color for the doors, which again can be switched to dark bluish gray if you want to achieve a different look.</p>

<p>- Another baby dragon if you are collecting them. They are a cute design. And the egg is a neat piece that can be used elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- As in all of my Elves reviews, I would love to see MORE foliage. The new pink and purple leaves are fun and fantastical and I&#39;d like to see more. It would help achieve a more wooded appearance and it would give us easier access since they are not exactly cheap in the aftermarket.</p>

<p>- The size works quite well, especially for the price. But I would like to see more depth or width to accommodate the table and chairs inside the building. Unless it is supposed to be a picnic table area, which then it works out okay.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>I would highly recommend this set. If you are an Elves fan, it will be a nice setting for your collection. If you are a castle fan, you can always tinker with the colors and create something great for your layout. If you just like display sets, this actually works quite well for that too.</p>
