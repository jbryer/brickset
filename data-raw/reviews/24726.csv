<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>It went really well. Easy to see what part of the build you were doing. I loved doing all of it-finding the lava fall mechanism and the mechanism for turning the Shadow Fountain water from a poisoned green to a pure blue, and the dragon, and the Shadow Fountain, and the lava cave. The cave also has a sort of secret window right behind&nbsp;the rockfall, very nice.</p>

<p><strong><em>&nbsp;Play</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;It went well enough, I suppose.&nbsp;The description helped me come up with a story, and then I came up with my own-saving a couple crystals(crystals not included. The only crystal is a trans neon green one, that&#39;s for the Shadow Fountain).</p>

<p><strong><em>Parts</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;They were very cool. Definitely what you&#39;d expect in a lava cave, and it has the Shadow Fountain&nbsp;in Cursed Crystal Canyon. Although I found the purple rock a bit weird-but maybe the lava cave is in the Diamond Peaks. I&#39;m not asking questions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Something really cool!!</em></strong></p>

<p>Okay,&nbsp;if any of you reading this review have also read Lego Elves Chapter Book # 2(Dragon Queen) then you&#39;ll know what I&#39;m&nbsp;talking about. You know the mind-controlling helmet that Zonya the fire dragon is wearing, before Emily takes it off in Dragon Queen? Well, if you take off Zonya&#39;s head embellishments(not the horns, just the jewel, the piece&nbsp;the jewel is mounted on and the slope)and replace them with the black bit on the Shadow Fountain, the one with the green and black sticker? And the trans green pyramid piece? If you put that on Zonya&#39;s head it looks like the helmet, very sleek and not weird at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Dragon</em></strong></p>

<p>The dragon is admittedly very cool. There&#39;s another commenter on Set 41175-1, their username is MeganL. She said that you can&#39;t rotate Zonya&#39;s wings-MeganL, you kind of can rotate Zonya&#39;s wings, it&#39;s just not very far. It helps if you want to make Zonya look like she&#39;s flying if you&#39;re keeping her when you&#39;re not playing with her on, say, a dresser(which I am). You can also make her stand on 3 legs, with one raised up slightly. Also helps for making Zonya look like she&#39;s flying.</p>

<p><em><strong>Instructions&nbsp;</strong></em></p>

<p>They&#39;re really cool! Five pages of beautiful pictures and a map to look at in the back of #2, and really easy to follow as always.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Minifigs(in this set, mini-dolls)</em></strong></p>

<p>This Azari is my favourite, &#39;cause I don&#39;t like the rows of fire dress, the magenta and orange-rimmed one-I like the corset much better. Emily&#39;s mini-doll is very nice, although her shirt looks a little weird. I do like the way her amulet looks, though, and her shorts. Both hair pieces are great. I don&#39;t like, however,&nbsp;that Azari&#39;s... magic fire piece, I guess,&nbsp;isn&#39;t printed, she simply gets a trans round red 1x1 piece. I got an&nbsp;extra fire icon, though, so that&#39;s what I use. Azari&#39;s clothes are very detailed, they look a lot like her dress in her picture on the covers of the instructions.</p>

<p><strong><em>Overall</em></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Get this set. You will have plenty of fun with it.</p>
