<ul>
	<li>The <strong>playability </strong>of this set is great. The floors of the main, two-floor building can be separated, so playing with the book shop is just as easy as with the post office. There are some hidden places, many accessories, two figures (female and male, Aira&nbsp;and Farran), two animals and a dragon!</li>
	<li>Nice <strong>accessories</strong>: I love the &quot;Book of Dragons&quot;, and the set also has a&nbsp;drawer/writing desk,&nbsp;lamps (smart use of pans!), a padlock, keys, simple but nice pumpkins, a gift box, sweets, a map, letters and mailbox,&nbsp;and more.</li>
	<li><strong>Beautiful colours</strong> (as usual in Elves). The greenery, fruits and fungi&nbsp;look fantastic.</li>
	<li>The <strong>goldsmith </strong>resembles the one in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10193-1/Medieval-Market-Village"">10193-1: Medieval Market Village</a>: the mechanism looks simpler, but seems to work&nbsp;just as fine!</li>
	<li>So many <strong>spare pieces</strong>... even a dragon wing. And an extra separator always comes in handy.</li>
	<li>The <strong>owl </strong>is cute and can wear the spare tiara :)</li>
	<li>It&#39;s good to have so many <strong>stickers</strong>...</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
	<li>... but they still are stickers, not printed pieces :(</li>
	<li>The <strong>books </strong>on the shelves are just stacks of basic two-knob pieces. It <em>looks</em>&nbsp;fine, but they are fixed: fewer books or (printed?) flat tiles would make more sense.</li>
	<li>Is asking for alternate builds too much?</li>
</ul>

<p>This set has a perfect balance between pieces, figures, accessories and overall playability. It also looks great on the shelf. It might not be the cheapest, but it is certainly worth every penny! (Especially if you get it at a discounted price now that it&#39;s being discontinued, I paid just &euro;36 for it)</p>
