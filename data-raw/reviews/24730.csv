While the set names are different it is obvious that this one is an update for Emma&rsquo;s Fashion Design Studio. In fact this and the other set could be combined to make one large impressive looking little fashion workshop for Emma.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: Standard LEGO Friends box design with this one, which as always stands out quite nicely on the shelf. I enjoy all of the image choices to show off the sets on the back and the front to show off all of the features and play opportunities here.</p>

<p>Instructions: Again you&rsquo;ll find your standard LEGO Friends design here for the manual. What I find really fun about this is the evolution of the cross-promotional imagery for all the sets of a given wave in the back of the manual. LEGO has consistently improved upon the artistic look of where the sets fit together in Heartlake City.</p>

<p>The steps are also quite easy to follow and you rarely find difficult steps during the build process for any of these cheap sets.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll find a lot of standard parts in the set. Standard for LEGO Friends that is, usual items like nice teal, maroon and pink pieces as well as the many bow accessories in various colours and the purple laptop piece. I think the best part is the teal flower part that is used for the lamp in Emma&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p><strong>Minifidoll</strong></p>

<p>Emma: This version of Emma is very impressive mostly because of her torso print design. She&rsquo;s wearing some sort of apron or coveralls over her dark pink tee-shirt and it&rsquo;s loaded with tools for her fashion designing work. A pen, a ruler and a little bow are part of the finer detail work.</p>

<p>Her legs are the short skirt piece in what I believe is a faded purple colour and she&rsquo;s wearing a matching pair of shoes. She&rsquo;s got a hair bow on the back and is using a pair of scissors as an accessory. Very nice version of Emma.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Everything about this build is standard fare from LEGO Friends. It includes some excellent build techniques for a standing lamp, a sewing machine, a desk, an easel holding design ideas on a sticker that is applied to the piece and the computer desk with the window and bow showcase on top. Everything about this build was quite fun and I do believe many younger builders will enjoy this, there are no tricky elements or difficult steps to follow and everything stands out as very well designed.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Sewing Desk: This, in my opinion, is the best model of the set. It is a large rectangular desk with a chair for Emma to sit on while she&rsquo;s working with the sewing machine. And the sewing machine is the most impressive thing I&rsquo;ve seen out of a Friends set in a good long while. The spool for the thread is very cleverly design and the extra elements for bolts of fabric are nice design choices that add to the look of the workspace for Emma.</p>

<p>Design Easel: This is a fun little model with some sticker placement for details. The hinged joint piece is used for a third leg to help it balance so that Emma can come back to the design image when she wants a reminder as to what she&rsquo;s doing making all of these bows.</p>

<p>Computer Desk &amp; Window: This combination model features a small desk in front of a large window where the computer and camera sit when Emma&rsquo;s working. It&rsquo;s a nice play element and I especially enjoy the use of the Dalek eyestalk piece for bow holding pieces attached to the wall, when Emma finishes making one of her bows she can hang it up and show it off to all her friends.</p>

<p>Lamp: This little build is really fun. Love the reverse design with the fancy flower piece for the lampshade.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I love this update for Emma&rsquo;s workspace with fashion. Compared to the 2012 set the models here seem to be much better designed and far better executed. As I recall the desk in the original set was a bit higher than it should have been when compared to the scale of the Minidoll. This one may have a chair design that is a bit shorter than it should be, but it works when having Emma sit in front of the sewing machine to work on making more bows.</p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend this as one of the better 12.99$ sets from LEGO Friends. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with it.</p>
