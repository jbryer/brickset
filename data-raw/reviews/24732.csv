<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The shinier printing in some places on the box stands out.</p>

<p>As usual, I had no trouble following set instructions. It&#39;s often a bit hard to align stickers, but especially so for the recessed white panel here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The plate is sturdier than a baseplate. Its bottom pattern is different from smaller plates, probably to manage the size. The scaffolding is a part I&#39;ve seen before, but not often. The 1x2x5 in transparent blue is striking from both sides and works for either. The giant water jets are cool either foreground or background. For production reasons, it makes sense to use a flame mold in a different color.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A standard minidoll</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As usual, nice to see how the model comes together</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I particularly liked the spotlights. The black stickers blended in well with the black background. The speakers are a common design in Friends music sets, but I like the color scheme here and using a jumper plate to angle them. That being the same color as the base means it blends in well. The podium and trophy reminds me of 30205 Pop Star Red Carpet in a good way. The mechanism turns fairly smoothly. I liked having some detail and working movement on the camera cart.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Another hit in the Pop Star series</p>
