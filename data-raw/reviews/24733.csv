"mr_piggle","2016-05-30T16:31:04.46Z","Gotta Get The Bread and Milk!","<p>Heartlake&nbsp;is no stranger to shops, especially ones where food can be purchased. The Heartlake Food Market was released in 2015, and word is&nbsp;minidoll Mia is a frequent&nbsp;shopper there. However a new year brings new competition, and it appears that Mia has decided to check out the newest grocery store in town-- the Heartlake Supermarket. Is the Heartlake Supermarket better than 2015&#39;s offering? Is there room in Heartlake for two food marts?! Let&#39;s find out!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is standard Friends fare, shades of purple surrounding product photos, depictions of the five core Friends on the top right of the front of the box. The back, as usual, depicts play features. The back side of this box seems unusally informative, though I likely haven&#39;t spent enough time looking at the rear of the boxes. There are illustrations depicting how to assemble a mini doll, what to expect inside the box in terms of bags and instructions, a small rectangle depicting all of the special tiles and food items to be found, and of course, play features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside the box are two plates, two instruction booklets, and three bags of pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Truthfully, there&#39;s nothing that I can find in the inventory that&#39;s unique to this set. Though I love the pineapple and the sushi, they are available elsewhere. The sushi is available in just one other set, however. You won&#39;t find the fish in many other places, it is in only one other set that is less expensive than this one, and that is a Ninjago set. You&#39;ll only find the pineapple within Heartlake, at the competing Food Market and the Juice Bar. The green ice cream element used for grapes isn&#39;t too many other places. This is true for most of the printed foodstuffs and items-- you&#39;ll find them within Heartlake or outside of Heartlake in expensive sets, but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two minidolls in this set. This set has Friend&nbsp;Mia looking pretty in blues, and ready to make some healthy food choices. Daniel is decked out in his Supermarket uniform shirt, the orange and yellow matching the awning. Daniel appears to only be available in this set. Perhaps we&#39;ll see more of him outside of work in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This build is in three main stages-- the main storefront and accessories, the swinging side store attachment, and the store &quot;guts&quot;. There is nothing complex about this build aside from sticker placements.&nbsp;At 313 pieces it&#39;s challenging enough for smaller builders to have an experience with it, and fun enough to keep more experienced builders entertained at watching the various departments of the&nbsp;store come to life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model when completed doesn&#39;t feel skimpy. It feels adequate and complete, as all areas of a supermarket are represented. The completed model is very cute, and it&#39;s quite easy for Mia to take her shopping cart for a stroll through the various sections of the store to pick up her healthy snacks (and some chocolate). She is well-equipped to pay with the printed money, and to put her cart away in the cart rack when she is finished. Daniel is comfortably found behind the checkout counter, with a cleverly designed check out area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love that there is flexibility in this set, the hinged portion of the store can either be clipped into place making the storefront wider, or unclipped and swung around into a longer configuration. That is a testament to the cleverness to be found in many of the Heartlake sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The colors of this model are vibrant without being excessively girly, which is a complaint of many when it comes to Friends sets. There are pink highlights and of course the base plates are lavender, but there is plenty of brilliant orange and yellow to be found in this set, which makes it accessible beyond girls. Truthfully, aside from the stigma that many attach to minidolls, this set is almost a better supermarket than anything that has been created on the City side of the Lego Universe (outside of the Green Grocer).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This model is a total win. It&#39;s cute, it&#39;s fun, it feels substantial for the price and piece count, and it would be just as at home in Lego Town or City as it is in Heartlake. &nbsp;I have been totally charmed by this set. Would I like a bigger supermarket? Of course, but this suits the purpose and packs quite a bit of fun for the younger set. Does it totally outshine the previously released Food Mart? That&#39;s a matter of opinion, in my opinion there could be a place for both stores in Heartlake and in many collections, but because of this set&#39;s coloring, larger size and emphasis on the market aspect (instead of the Food Market&#39;s small size and emphasis on the&nbsp;apartment),&nbsp;some rare pieces, and the unique minidoll&nbsp;of Daniel,&nbsp;this set is a no-brainer.</p>
