<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box provides plenty of photos that can&nbsp;capture&nbsp;any young girl&#39;s imagination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions were clear and concise (118 steps in two booklets), however there&#39;s a bit of a mistake in step 109: The couch, which was visible in the previous steps suddenly disappears before reappearing a few pages later. &nbsp;It has no material impact on the instructions, however it was obvious enough.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The colors scheme of the parts was&nbsp;very appealing. Dad&#39;s note: Clearly we disagree there, but it works well for the friends theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was a surprising&nbsp;number of extra pieces.&nbsp;However, it seemed they might have been added intentionally&nbsp;in order to decorate some of the plainer cupcakes next to the cashier...or for creating new cupcakes.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is the only set to date that has Naomi (the baker), which is a nice bonus. &nbsp;Also, this is the only set that has Stephanie in a lavender skirt - which fits wonderfully in any [friends]&nbsp;collection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was a lot of fun to build. &nbsp;It was my favorite set to build, because there were so many little builds. &nbsp;Particularly fun were the 3 appliances:</p>

<p><strong>1. The coffee machine</strong></p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;The blender</strong></p>

<p><strong>3.&nbsp;The big oven</strong></p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This&nbsp;set offers a lot of space for playing and is beautiful to look at too. &nbsp;It has a rotating cupcake display, and is nicely decorated. &nbsp;Here&nbsp;are some photos...</p>

<p><strong>The Front</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Inside</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Patio</strong></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set - it&#39;s my favorite as I built it all by myself. &nbsp;And now, my Lego friends have a place to relax after a long day of playing together.</p>
