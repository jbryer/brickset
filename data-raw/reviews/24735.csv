<p>I liked the two types of target and how they&#39;d actually work with the stud shooter. Like usual for those, if actually used, the piece could bounce all over the room. Another bow might look better for display; I took the black compound bow from a spare 70332 Ultimate Aaron.</p>

<p>Like most small sets, it was a simple build.</p>

<p>The set was a good value for parts once discounted, but would&#39;ve been better if it focused on the archery itself.</p>
