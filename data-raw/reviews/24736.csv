I love the detail on both; the trees were similar but the fire pit stands out. I liked the signpost that pointed to both that and the Archery Range.</p>

<p>The raft could barely fit through the bridge. It looks too hard to expand with more plates.</p>

<p>It was nice to have an extra tent cover; I even built another tent with the same pieces in (mostly) different colors. However, I wish the end flaps stayed shut on their own.</p>

<p>It was a good deal once marked down.</p>

<p>As is common for LEGO:<br />
Most instruction steps were small and almost too easy. (The overall build was straightforward but not too easy)<br />
Furniture with a smooth tile surface doesn&#39;t work - here that happened with the bench the marshmallow sticks were rested on.<br />
A bunch of small pieces inflated the piececount.<br />
Friends can go nicely with similarly themed regular LEGO, in this case Hiker from Minifigures Series 16. (Ironically, it was Boy Scout camp experience that got me interested in these girl camp sets)</p>
