<p>Very cute fully-equipped kitchen inside, plenty of windows and large transparent pieces, and a cool feature of having sliding doors for the house.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit small, but I guess most of the newer Lego sets are. RM279 for 597 pieces, which I personally think is great value because of all the large bricks and transparent bricks you get.</p>

<p>On the downside, the mini dolls have trouble sitting. They keep falling off the poolside lounger and the float in the middle of the pool (I&#39;ve lost count of how many times Livi drowned because of this).</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a security camera trained at the pool area, so perhaps Livi enjoys filming her friends playing in the pool?</p>

<p>The roof also oddly covers only half the building, which means Livi doesn&#39;t even need water in her toilet; she could just wait for rain.</p>

<p>Also since there are no back walls, there&#39;s the risk of her slipping in the shower and falling down the stairs into the pool below. Poor Livi; she sure needs a less life-threatening house.</p>

<p>Overall, this has been a fun set to build with plenty of play features (&#39;Livi making breakfast!&#39; &#39;Livi making secret videos of her friends in the pool!&#39; &#39;Livi slipping and falling in the shower into the pool!&#39;). Get it if you enjoy recreating the secret life of Livi the pop star!</p>
