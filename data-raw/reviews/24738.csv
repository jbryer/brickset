"alfred_the_buttler","2018-10-13T07:00:45.54Z","Very fun set for pre-schoolers","<p>This is one of my son&#39;s first, and still one of his favorite sets.&nbsp; Whenever you have a police and a bad guy you are in for a lot of fun, but this set also gives you three $100 bills and a sack of money.&nbsp; In fact the helicopter takes a back seat to the minifigures and accessories for my son, ut is still fun.</p>

<p>The helicopter is very simple to build thanks 2 bricks accounting for 95% of its mass.&nbsp; This of course makes it a great starter set, but it is still enough to keep my son interested over a year later.&nbsp; However, it is also very simple to break, and my son doesn&#39;t like rebuilding sets as he plays with them.&nbsp; The spotlight constantly falls off, and really everything else (with an exception for the main propellors) fall off easily.&nbsp; For this reason I can&#39;t rate the building experience very high.</p>

<p>Of course with just two minifigures, this set needs to be combined with other police sets to make play more interesting.&nbsp; As a result, this set is always being combined with several other police sets.</p>
