"andyh1984","2016-03-31T21:06:10.707Z","A really nice set to start 'em young","<p>I must admit that I bought this set because it had Loki in but I really like it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is nice and bright and the instructions are (as you would expect) extremely simple and will be very&nbsp;easy for very young builders.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The main body of the car is one piece and you build on the inside and outside of it</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I bought this set for Loki and he is excellent ,as is Iron Man. And unlike the similar price Mighty Micros sets,&nbsp;which have cartoony angry faces, these have normal character faces like the larger/ more expensive sets (you can see Loki&#39;s face on the box).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Iron Man&#39;s car is putting pieces onto the outside (front, rear and sides) and the seat etc. on the inside, and the stand for the Tesseract&nbsp;is a easy mini build, both of which should be no problem for young ones</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks&nbsp;really nice and has good&nbsp;playability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For the price I like this set more than I was expecting as I bought it for the Loki&nbsp;Minifigure&nbsp;(he is hard to find in low priced sets) and am glad I bought it as an impulse purchase (my wife spotted it while I was looking at the older age bracket sets) and the bricks are all standard size lego so can be incorporated&nbsp;as a child grows older.</p>

There isn&#39;t that many parts so it only took me five minutes to build but most of them are rare for example the printed tiles on iron mans car and the transparent blue cube to represent the tesseract. The build of the car doesn&#39;t include much pieces as most of the car is made of one brick. Now to the tesseract stand, it&#39;s an ok build but the 2x4 bricks which are holding it up seem kind of odd but could easily be replaced with 1x4 bricks.</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>iron man and Loki figures&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rare pieces&nbsp;</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>Quite expensive just for two minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>not many pieces to create Mocs&nbsp;with&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the set is ok for the minifigures&nbsp;and parts (if you&#39;re an adult fan) and great for young children getting into Lego and learning how to build.&nbsp;</p>

"Japanbuilder","2017-06-26T03:23:59.743Z","Great launchpad set to expand later. ","<p>Set 10721: Iron Man Vs. Loki is an unexpected delight. In both the minifigures and the build we find a set that can definitely launch a theme for a child or just add parts to further enhance your already existing super heroes or even city scenes. Let&#39;s take a further look into the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>We get a comic style graphic on the front of the box along with our two characters depicted in a contest for the Tesseract. The back is equally well adorned and emphasizes the ease of building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we get a manual, no stickers and some great pieces. We get 2 printed pieces, one with a version of the Arc Reactor for Iron Man&#39;s car and one with Tony Stark&#39;s custom license plate. Both fo these are great. We get two trans clear blue bars and 4 red ones, useful for parting down and adding to a possible Star Wars setting. A few fun pieces in pearl gold color and a Juniors car chassis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There were no spare parts when I completed the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>A real draw to the set will be the minifigures. We get two official ones here and despite the Juniors theme and they are great to have, particularly if you don&#39;t already have these. I believe the Iron Man has the Mark 7 printing on him and he looks great. We get a dual faced head for Tony Stark; one confident and one angry.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Loki comes with a great printed torso and legs. We also get his staff with gem stone and matching helmet. The helmet is a softer material so it will only snap due to abuse or temperature extremes. His cape feels softer also almost like the one used for King Halbert&nbsp;in the Nexo Knight line. It is still stiff but not as stiff as a lot of the capes in the Star Wars lines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally having that Iron Man means you can easily replace the included pieces for more traditional ones and upgrade your Iron Man to full power later if you wish, like so:&nbsp;</p>

<p>(*pieces for the above shot&nbsp;are not included in the retail set.)</p>

<p><strong>The Build and Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The set only has 66 pieces&nbsp;so it came together very fast, probably not even 5 minutes and it was up and ready. And for what it is, it is great. Our hero gets and objective and the tools to achieve it. Our foe gets, well magic, and some laser bars to defend his objective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car itself was delight because of the one-piece chassis. As soon as I finished building it I parted it down and started customizing it. It expands very well and by very well I mean very very very well. I was able to add cannons, modular expansions for different loadouts. I was even able to add wings to it! If this is your first LEGO set it will be a great platform with which to launch your imagination as your collection of LEGO pieces grows.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set was a surprising delight. The figures are great to have and the build really encourages imagination. I was surprised&nbsp;how many types of things I was able to turn that car chassis into. I definitely recommend it. The only negative is the price. I jumped on this set late in the game and paid a bit extra for it. Still if you can find it for retail or even lower prices then go for it.&nbsp;</p>
