<p>A little red juniors box with the Ninjago logo in the corner. It shows the car and motorbike in action.<br />
The instructions are in a small booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Only 92 parts in this set, but some of them are quite big (a ramp, a big plate (8x8) and a brown mountain element). I especially like the ramp (#6135106) which is printed (no stickers in this set) and looks pretty cool with some cracks through which you can see Lava.</p>

<p>There is also a cool Serpentine staff which is what they seem to be fighting about.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Kai and Lasha the Serpentine are the two figs. Both are an exclusive version for this set and a good way to get a serpentine if you or your child missed out on older versions of Serpentine.</p>

<p>The detail on the figs is very nice, like we have come to expect from Ninjago. Especially the printing on Lasha is very detailed. The printing differs form the previous version plus, this one has a red arm.</p>

<p>Kai has a hood with gold detail which in this version is exclusive to this set. The torso has golden flames and is the &#39;rebooted&#39; version, seen also in the sets from the 2014 wave that have Kai.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A pretty straightforward build as can be expected from a junior model. It took my 6-year old about 15 minutes from start to finish.</p>

<p>There are three main stages, Kai&#39;s car, Lasha&#39;s motorcycle and the lava rock. Of these the car is the most complicated, but for someone with a bit of experience these won&#39;t pose any sort of difficulty.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice little model, which comprises of some good unique figs and parts for not too much money. Some of the junior sets are a good way to get minifigures you might have missed or to get some special elements for an elaborate MOC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a standalone set, it is pretty small, but it&#39;s fairly inexpensive. This is a good set for a new, unexperienced builder. You can get the enemies to chase each other, jump over the fire, try to catch the staff, fight each other, race each other, ... So for the price point you get quite a bit of playability.</p>

<p>I am not totally sure of the setting in the Ninjago timeline. I&#39;ve watched all the episodes up to season 6 and I can&#39;t really place it. It might come in the upcoming film, or might be just a set with two of the characters in a volcano setting that reminds of the temple of fire, while fighting for one of the staffs.</p>
