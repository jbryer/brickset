I was really not expecting much from it other than Cinderella and her prince. I was surprised at how much I liked the set overall though - it&#39;s simple but charming.</p>

<p>Mostly I like the carriage - the three different shades of blue really work well here, and the pink, white, and gold accents are sweet. The four light blue sloped pieces have incredibly beautiful printing - swirls of silver with white sparkles - and are printed all over on both sides. These are perhaps some of the loveliest printed Lego pieces I have ever seen! The large gold wheels are quite elegant. The little castle wall backdrop features a single big molded piece (which is silly), but I also found the window scene printing here really lovely, and of course they would not have been able to print such a large space if it had been built of multiple pieces. The little pink clock tile is also printed - no stickers at all in this set!</p>

<p>The Cinderella and Prince Charming minidolls look great. Cinderella is wearing a light blue dress with delicate silver and white printed accents. Charming&#39;s shirt has gold epaulettes and details on the front, and his trousers have sleek yellow stripes up the side. Both dolls look very regal and elegant. The little puppy with her doghouse is a cute addition, and I like the orange minifigure head representing a pumpkin in the little garden.</p>

<p>Overall, considering the tiny number of pieces and the fact that it is a &quot;Juniors&quot; set, I think they did a good job in creating something quite attractive and potentially fun to play with. There is nothing interesting about the build at all, but for a really little kid this could be fine. Although it doesn&#39;t come close to matching the splendor of the Disney Castle, the carriage and dolls do look fitting displayed nearby.</p>

<p>I think the RRP is ridiculous for what it is though - would not pay anything close to that for such a small set.</p>
