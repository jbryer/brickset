<h3 style=""margin: 1em 0cm;"">Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Surprisingly I thought the box might have been bigger, but it was quite compact. As is now the norm with Lego boxes the imagery is excellent and exciting and draws you in nicely, the inclusion of the Bat symbol from the upcoming film is quite nice as well</p>

<h3 style=""margin: 1em 0cm;"">Parts</h3>

<p>There are some great parts in this set, the two canopy pieces are fantastic and there are some great little detailed parts like 2x3 angled nose (22385) and new(ish) six shooter (18588) that are great to have and what I think is a new cross axle colour, red (61300050). As we all know Batman only likes to work in Black or really, really, really dark grey so there are a fair few pieces in that tone but the Lexcorp Chopper adds some colour to proceedings</p>

<h3 style=""margin: 1em 0cm;""><span>Minifigures</span></h3>

<p>The Batplane is fantastic but as always the minifigures are the standout elements. With this set you get five, which is a great number given the price point and size of the set, but what is more, you get all the main players (as far as we know).</p>

<p>Lex &ndash; This is a nice figure and interesting to see a Lex with hair. The torso is detailed and from the film trailers looks spot on, the hair less so, but there is no mistaking he is the &lsquo;baddie&rsquo; of the set.</p>

<p>Louis Lane &ndash; This is a simple figure but nicely done, the torso printing is excellent and the hair, head and legs work very well, but this isn&rsquo;t the most exciting of figures.</p>

<p>Batman &ndash; This is a great figure, the printing looks amazing on the torso and the dual coloured legs, the new cape and cowl introduced last year are present and simply perfect, this is a top notch batman.</p>

<p>Superman &ndash; It is hard to say anything too different from the Batman figure here. The torso is the best Superman printed to date (IMO) the dual coloured legs look great and the new hair piece for superman is a much better match to Henry Cavill than previous versions, topped off with a soft cape and double head print (red eyed angry and smiley face) this is an amazing figure</p>

<p>Wonder Woman &ndash; This is by far the standout figure in the set (which is saying something given how good the others are) the printing on the torso and legs is amongst the best I have ever seen and the details on the arms are great. The head print is perfect and it is good to see the headband printed there rather than on the hair, it looks so much better. The hair is nice, although I think Gal Gadot&rsquo;s hair is straighter in the film than seen here.</p>

<h3 style=""margin: 1em 0cm;"">The build</h3>

<p>The Build is split into two parts. The Lexcorp Chopper, which is a simple little build and I suspect in there to meet the price point as much as anything.</p>

<p>The real joy comes from the Batplane. As with all planes the wings are identical so there is a little bit of repetitiveness there, but the technique of connecting them to the body and then securing them with the folding mechanism is fun.</p>

<p>The main body is a nice little build and the canopy parts and opening hinges are new (certainly to me) and unique which is great.</p>

<p>Having only seen snippets of the Batplane (and they mostly involve crashing) it is hard to say how accurate the model is to the film, but I would be prepared to say fairly at this point, which is good.</p>

<h3 style=""margin: 1em 0cm;"">The completed model</h3>

<p>Overall the models are nice, the Lexcorp is a bit of a filler vehicle but the Batplane is great, with some lovely hinge movements and mechanisms and together there is a lot of play value and &lsquo;swooshabilty&rsquo;</p>

<h3 style=""margin: 1em 0cm;"">Overall opinion</h3>

<p style=""margin: 1em 0cm;""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt;"">This is a great set, the Batplane is outstanding and the selection of minfigures are amongnts the best ever produced in a superhero set. This is easily the best set to buy if you want to collect all the main characters from the upcoming film and for DC fans I think it is an essential purchase. All that said the Lexcorp chopper is a bit pointless and simple but you are buying this set for the hero&rsquo;s and it is well worth it.</span></p>

"Beyond_The_Hod","2017-04-25T22:56:20.89Z","Not all good but good overall","<p>The Lexcorp helicopter is not great. It doesn&#39;t look particularly stylish ro well designed and it proved a bit delicate and comes to pieces too easily for my liking.</p>

<p>On the plus side the Batwing portion of this set (the main event really) is very cool. Nice design, sleek, playable, and with some&nbsp;nice pieces included. I thought the minifigs were good as well though I have heard people saying the&nbsp;Lois Lane&nbsp;one was dull.</p>

The box design is very simple and quite impressive, it really shows the features of the set nicely and you&rsquo;re never disappointed when you pick one up off the shelf. The image on the front is certainly more fun and action packed looking compared to what we saw in the movie for the confrontation between Lex and Superman.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Kryptonite Interception set features these parts in a much cheaper offering if you&rsquo;re looking for them for MOC ideas, however it is nice to see them here too in a uniform look across the entire sub-theme.</span></span></span></span></p>

If you&rsquo;ve seen one Batman you&rsquo;ve kind of seen them all, the overall design of the costume changes, but the print detailing for his Minifigures is typically the same. A bat symbol on his chest, strong musculature on his back and front, a utility belt around his waist. Typically no leg printing and a dual-sided face with variant expressions of scowling or angry looks.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">He includes a softer cape to avoid creasing while he&rsquo;s in the cockpit, dual-molded legs for the black bat boots and a grapple gun accessory for hand-to-hand fighting. Overall not much to say that hasn&rsquo;t been said before.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Lex Luthor: Luthor&rsquo;s face hasn&rsquo;t changed much between this and his previous releases. This version is dressed in a boring looking tan outfit though, with plain tan legs and a dual-sided torso. He also gets his hair piece, aka his wig, in the form of a light brownish toned piece we&rsquo;ve seen on such Minifigures as Thor (if I&rsquo;m not mistaken) and Boromir. Not the best character in the set, but an ok villain for what we&rsquo;ve got.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her hair is the same, however I believe she&rsquo;s sporting a new double-sided face with frightened and irritated looking expressions. She&rsquo;s also got a camera accessory this time.</span></span></span></span></p>

I would have liked to see some printing on the upper portion of the legs to match with what they did in MoS sets, but perhaps it would have cost too much.</span></span></span></span></p>

She comes with a circle shield with bird imagery printed on the front and a sword first found in Lord of the Rings sets. Overall a very fun figure, I&rsquo;m looking forward to the Wonder Woman sets coming out this year to compare the two.</span></span></span></span></p>

Standard LEGO Helicopter design work for the main pilot area, but the tail section build is rather clever and does something I haven&rsquo;t seen before. The build is very easy to follow and doesn&rsquo;t have anything too tricky to trip up younger builders.</span></span></span></span></p>

The central torso construction in this bag is relatively quick to go and there are no difficult portions of the build. Pay close attention to the alignment of parts and pins and be mindful of sticker placement for the Bat logo and that&rsquo;s all there is to it. Also putting the cockpit canopy is relatively simple, but be aware that you might have to fiddle a little with the technic pins to angle them closed properly once attached.</span></span></span></span></p>

The design of the wing is permanently angled and due to the geared gimmick feature you will find yourself attaching a few Technic pins and the like to attach properly to the central chassis so the function works properly.</span></span></span></span></p>

The socket jointed smaller wing needs to be placed properly for the gimmick to work though.</span></span></span></span></p>

If you&rsquo;ve gotten through the previous three bags without any problems you shouldn&rsquo;t suffer any trouble here. It&rsquo;s just an asymmetrical build following the reverse of the steps used to construct the last wing.</span></span></span></span></p>

I love the use of cylinders in the construction of the tail section, it adds a different aesthetic to a helicopter in LEGO form and makes it stand out compared to the similar design and coloured helicopter we had in the Malibu Mansion set from Iron Man. You&rsquo;ve got eight flick-fire missiles, four on either side, which stick out which does look a bit awkward, but adds more play to the set overall so I can live with it.</span></span></span></span></p>

Pull a lever and a system of gears and axles rotate the wings up for landing mode, now granted this does have one minor problem, it doesn&rsquo;t sit flush when you put it down. The back is slightly higher than the front so it isn&rsquo;t evenly deposited on the shelf when the wings are up. Also you have to take care that the fins which stick out of each wing vertically are angled properly so they won&rsquo;t bang into each other and disrupt the gimmick.</span></span></span></span></p>

"shea42","2017-07-04T09:30:49.213Z","A lot of good with a little bad","<p>This set is a bit mixed - it has a lot of excellent parts, but there are a few smaller things which let it down.</p>

<p>The minifigures are mostly excellent. It&#39;s wonderful to receive all the major cast of the film in this one set. The dual-moulded legs for Batman and Superman are definitely worth getting. Wonder Woman is an amazing figure, though she does really need dual moulded legs to get the skin tone on her legs correct. It&#39;s also really nice to get Lois Lane and Lex Luthor. However, I don&#39;t think that Lex&#39;s or Superman&#39;s face prints are appropriate to this set. Superman barely ever smiled in the film, and so a more serious face print would have been much better than the enormous grin that is included. And Lex really should have a new face print. His face is far too serious, where a smug, sly grin or nervous face would suit his film character far better.</p>

<p>As far as the model, this really is a strange combination. The helicopter is absolutely awful. The green colour is inaccurate and looks garish, and the model comes off looking ungainly and too disproportionate. It&#39;s really not worth the price of its parts.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Batwing is excellent. The model looks very smooth and beautiful, the new canopy piece a perfect&nbsp; accompaniment. Batman fits very nicely inside, and the stud shooter on the front provides a nice mix of appearance and play value. By far, my favorite feature is the wing-folding action. It&#39;s so smooth and nice - sometimes I find myself just flicking back between the two modes over and over, admiring how wonderfuly it works. It&#39;s the reason why this set is a four star model instead of three stars.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2018-09-20T04:58:32.15Z","There is plenty for our heroes to do here. ","<p><strong>Heroes of Justice: Sky High Battle</strong></p>

<p>Based on the rather negatively received Batman V Superman film we get a very hefty set to review here. Despite the source material does this set deliver a fun and enjoyable experience to your DC or super hero fan? Let&rsquo;s take a look.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging:</strong></p>

<p>We get a pretty nice box here. The back and front showcase the contents and are set to lively action sequences with the heroes and the villain of the set. I specially like the shots of the DC trinity at the bottom left of the back of the package.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>This set features an excellent assortment of figures, specially if you are in the market for the DC trinity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s kick things off with Wonder Woman. This figure is amazing. She gets very good printing from top to bottom and in vivid colors. In fact, they are a lot brighter than what we got in the film. The fine detail throughout her outfit and weapons is excellently showcased here. The shield in particular is a highlight piece in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Batman is up next and the Caped Crusader looks really nice here. The color palette overall harkens back to Frank Miller&rsquo;s work on the Dark Knight Returns comic. Plus we get duel molded legs here. His skin tone is a bit darker than on film but overall it gives him that darker, grittier feel. Though I imagine this will be the most subjective thing and the likes to dislikes will vary from person to person.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last up in the trinity is the Man of Steel himself. Superman gets a pretty good suit here with duel molded legs as well. Sadly no printing of that cobalt blue running down his leg piece is present which is a real shame as it would be great to tie the whole look together with that trim from the torso piece. Most importantly though is the fact this Superman gets a smiling face. Now that is the real deal right there!</p>

<p>Outside of the trinity we get Lois Lane. The intrepid reporter for the Daily Planet looks pretty good here. Though to me, at least, this figure does not quite represent the actress that inspired this version of the character. Still she looks very good. I specially like the choice of clothing as it can be used in many settings outside of the one provided by the set. She also looks the part with her trusty camera.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last up in the series is Lex Luthor. This one fits the movie character very well though I fear using the traditional face for the Lex minifigure fails to capture the look of the actor. However, we are used to seeing Lex with this face most of the time so it works either way. I also like the outfit here as it can cross over to other scenes if need be.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quite interesting and enjoyable. The techniques for the wings of the Batwing are interesting and I like how transparent pieces are also used to further reinforce the frontal assembly that goes into the chassis. The Lexcorp helicopter is also a nifty build featuring a Speed Champions piece for the wind-shield of the vehicle. The design through and through was fun just because they went to the trouble to not make it look like a City styled copter. I also like the kryptonite rockets even though these would not make an appearance on film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here the spare parts that remained in my set:</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model/s:</strong></p>

<p>Both of these look simply great. The Batwing is very sleek with a very low head-on footprint. The wing span is also well done and the overall look is very stunning. The best part is it swooshes great and is just a lot of fun to play with. The only downside is the aforementioned flat-look to the vehicle. Batman here has to literally lie down on the craft in order to operate it. I have no clue how he is going to look at that console piece. The gatling stud shooter on the nose is fun. The only downside here that is major is the folding wing function. It elevates the vehicle at and odd angle from the rear. Though I do confess that folding option does make it easy to store this particular set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helicopter offers a great vehicle to spar against here. It is armed with rockets that bristle with Kryptonite which means Superman will need the help of his friends to take on Luthor. I imagine though Wonder Woman and Batman should be enough to take care of this particular Luthor. Still for imaginative play both vehicles are great and allow for multiple children to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Overall for a set that includes the Trinity it is fun. However, it is difficult not to overstate how inaccurate to the film the set&nbsp;is. Specifically Luthor&rsquo;s copter. In no cut of the film to date does it look anything like what is shown here. Nor do we get to see it armed with Kryptonite. I realize the constraints around these movie sets, but this is one set I wish would have come out some time after the film as I would have appreciated the inclusion of a Doomsday big-fig over the copter any day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this flaw, which is mostly a gripe a fan of the film would have, for a toy including the trinity and a very well executed Batwing this set can&rsquo;t be beat. If you love these DC characters this set has them all and has the best versions of these minifigures for this particular sub-set of DC licensed toys.</p>
