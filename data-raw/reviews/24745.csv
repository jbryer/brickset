"Turtlemoht","2016-03-31T05:26:55.177Z","Great shapes, limited features","<p>I&#39;m trying to dial-back my Lego spend this year, so I&#39;m only picking up the smaller two Captain America sets, mainly for the minifigures. On the shelf this set doesn&#39;t seem anything out of the ordinary but the great figures and low price point meant I had to have it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>There are&nbsp;three bags,&nbsp;one instruction manual and one sticker sheet included in the set. The box art is pretty standard LEGO, meaning it is unremarkable but very appealing and fits well with all the other super hero sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The colour&nbsp;selection impressed me&nbsp;with this set. With Black Panther&#39;s jet comes a range of purple and bright green bricks and plates that I&#39;ve not encountered before and&nbsp;two spring-fired missile pieces in black are included, which I&#39;ve not seen before.</p>

<p>There are also some interesting shaped pieces included, specifically the angular &#39;nose&#39; piece and curved windshield on the jet &nbsp;and some great large angled plates. I&#39;m unsure as to how rare these pieces are but they&nbsp;all come in useful-black (except the windscreen).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three included and each is great.</p>

<p>The Captain&nbsp;America uses the AoU detailed body but has a nice flesh head piece and hair instead of the printed helmet head used in other sets. The hair is the same piece that was introduced for the Batman v Superman sets, though in a light brown.</p>

<p>The Winter Soldier has fantastic, detailed printing on his torso and metal arm. The hair piece (I think of it as Aragorn hair) is perfect but it uses the Peter Quill&nbsp;head which is a little too happy for this character, I think.</p>

<p>Black Panther is an interesting figure. All in black, the torso&nbsp;and head print are intricate and the additional &#39;ears&#39; that clip on to the head are in good ABS plastic, rather than the rubber used in similar pieces in the Star Wars line.</p>

<p>While all three figures have highly detailed torsos, they all have un-printed legs. It&#39;s not a deal-breaker but it would have been nice to continue their costume design, particularly for Black Panther.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build consists of a truck and a jet, with the jet using about 2/3 of the total pieces in the set. In each case, the build surprised me and there are some unexpected techniques used.</p>

<p>For the truck, there construction of the bonnet and tray in the rear used pieces in unusual ways, and the overall shape is rugged, despite some single stud connections in the early phases of the build. Quite impressive.</p>

<p>For the jet, the tapered nose is interesting and the method used to firmly attach the angled wings is great. On the other hand, the fact that the windshield doesn&#39;t seal nicely around the cockpit (due to the angled pieces used)&nbsp;is a bit of a drawback in my eyes.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t apply stickers to my sets and this set really doesn&#39;t need them. They add some &#39;African&#39; symbols to the wings of the jet, a tiny control panel inside, and two number plates to the truck. These are all easily skip-able and I like this.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The two buildable vehicles look great, however, once they&#39;re complete you realize that so much effort went into the unusually sleek jet that there simply aren&#39;t any action features.&nbsp;The truck fires a missile from the bonnet, but other than that, these are display pieces.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing, it&#39;s&nbsp;merely surprising.</p>

<p>The jet is small but solid and ideal for swooshing. The truck is generic but designed well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a solid set. It&#39;s not particularly remarkable but you get two strong vehicles and three important characters from the&nbsp;MCU.</p>

<p>Go get it.</p>

"TK_1308","2016-04-06T16:55:42.4Z","""I know we're not perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.""","<p>The first sets from the expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe bring us more new characters and new versions of old favourites.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice long mid range box. Captain America is the figure of choice on the top. The front shows the Winter Soldier evading fire from Black Panther&#39;s jet while Captain America tries to cover him. The back shows a battle scene with several panels indicating all the play features.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. There are some nice pieces in this kit and a good variety of colours including some bright green and purple components.<br />
There are three bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains Captain America and the Taskforce jeep.<br />
Bag 2 contains Black Panther and the lower hull and starboard wing of the jet.<br />
Bag 3 contains the Winter Solider, the motorcycle and the upper hull and port wing of the jet.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with Captain America, The Winter Soldier and, for the first time, Black Panther.<br />
Captain America has some nice new detailing on his body and a new hair piece. His head has a smiling and fighting face. This is different to the head you&#39;ll find in the 76051 set. He comes armed with his trusty shield.<br />
The Winter Soldier is a great to have in this set if you weren&#39;t able to get hold of the limited edition polybag with the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier set. There&#39;s good detailing on his body, especially his left arm and his head features the smiling and fighting faces. Nice tough with the stubble beard on both. He comes armed with a black compact machine gun.<br />
Finally we have the set exclusive, Black Panther. A great minifigure and a very welcome addition to the expanding collection of Marvel characters. The grey and silver detailing on the torso is excellent and he has two horns on his head, moulded on a ring similar to the ones used on the newer Darth Maul figures in the Star Wars range. There&#39;s even painted detailing on this, too.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 20 minutes.<br />
Nothing unusual in the build and it&#39;s a pretty straightforward kit with regards to construction.<br />
The bike is all of 5 seconds work.&nbsp;<br />
The jeep is a nice, sturdy vehicle. They build is a little different from other jeeps in the Marvel kits and is designed very well, especially for kids to play with. The bull bar design on the front is a nice twist, as are the headlights.<br />
The jet is the more interesting build, with clever use of hinges and plates to make the wings the shape they are and give the nice, sleek appearance for a stealth jet. Some nice detailing and vents add to the look. I like the colour mix with the bright green and deep purple standing out well against the black.<br />
Yes, there are stickers, 4 on the jeep and 7 on the jet. Nothing too exciting on the jeep but the ones on the jet wings add nice detailing.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Well, the bike is nothing spectacular and what you see is what you get, but Bucky needs something to ride. The motorbike measures 6.5 cm long, 1 cm wide and 3.5 cm tall.<br />
Cap&#39;s jeep is, as stated, a good sturdy vehicle. It has a flatbed back for more figures to sit in, or for you to load up with equipment. There is a spring loaded missile launcher which is mounted in the engine area. The missile tail comes out into the seating area and can be launched by pushing the end down. The windscreen frame angles from upright down into the cab as desired. It measures 11.5 cm long, 6 cm wide and 6.5 cm tall.<br />
Panther&#39;s jet is a nice looking stealth plane and the use of curves, hinges and slopes keep the sleek lines running across the whole model. The cockpit seats one and features the ever popular fire extinguisher. There are two stud shooters, one mounted on each side of the lower hull under each wing. The jet is 23 cm long, 18 cm wingspan and 4.5 cm tall.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great set and a must have if only to get Black Panther. Also good for those who missed the Winter Soldier previously. The vehicles add nicely to 76051 Super Hero Airport Battle. The vehicle selection is great for kids and play as well as dioramas and displays.<br />
As with all previous releases, there is a mini comic included with the set.&nbsp;</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2016-08-05T21:36:33.647Z","Actually the Superior Civil War Jet","<p>This set could be seen as being a bit like Crossbones, in that it&#39;s one you buy for the figs. Yes, Black Panther is a main draw, but the jet is maybe a lot better than you&#39;d think...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing exciting here. Normal box, one stapled&nbsp;booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing exciting here either. A lot of black. And a little bit of bright green.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Bucky/The Winter Soldier: I&#39;ve not exactly changed my opinion of him, so I&#39;m&nbsp;gonna copy and paste in my evaluation from the airport set now:&nbsp;Pretty good. Torso printing is ace, and is very easily transferable to other spy-type dudes - I used mine for a Bobbi Morse - but the legs could use some printing. His arm has&nbsp;been through some serious stuff&nbsp;since&nbsp;his really rare,&nbsp;then&nbsp;kinda&nbsp;rare,&nbsp;then&nbsp;common as muck&nbsp;polybag&nbsp;appearance last year, and now looks suitably worn, which is accurate to the movie. His hair is on point, but it&#39;s the face I have the biggest issue with - I didn&#39;t know Chris Pratt played Bucky. I don&#39;t&nbsp;mind re-using faces (Though Gandalf for Pym? Unacceptable) but my problem is two people who co-exist in the same universe having the same face. I think for this reason, Bucky should have gotten a new face print.</p>

<p>(The wonders of modern technology!)</p>

<p>Captain America/Steve Rogers: Torso and legs are same as usual, but here the added a head! And&nbsp;hair! Oh boy! I&#39;m not a huge fan though; I prefer the Helicarrier&nbsp;version. I feel this face suits Hawkeye better, where it is indeed later used. Also, when did Steve Rogers have a quiff?</p>

<p>Black Panther/T&#39;Challa: Epic fig. Crazy torso, face and horn(!) detail, although he could use some leg printing. Zod&#39;s legs are the best suggestion I have seen, but my pair are currently on my Daisy Johnson, so I haven&#39;t really bothered thus far, and I don&#39;t think it detracts hugely from the quality of the fig.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Surprisingly fun, once you&#39;re past the truck.&nbsp;The angles of the wings are pretty interesting and satisfying to see come together. Also, the obligatory fire extinguisher.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A really nice, sleek jet. That&#39;s about it. Ignore the truck.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is one of those sets that, like the Mandarin&#39;s Flanethrower Golf Buggy of Death,&nbsp;simply doesn&#39;t exist in the movies. Yes, T&#39;Challa does&nbsp;chase Bucky, but his jet doesn&#39;t crop up til much later on, and it&#39;s in a tunnel, not known for being very jet friendly. Also the Taskforce&nbsp;don&#39;t have trucks like that, and Steve&#39;s against the Taskforce anyway! Fortunately, unlike the Mandarin set, this one is actually good. Yes, Black Panther is (arguably) the main draw, but you also get a really nice jet for your trouble.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions are the&nbsp;same as the other sets, nothing special about the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Good parts, especially the black Nexo&nbsp;Knights part on the jet. Good to get a motorcycle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Great exclusive figures (except for the Winter Soldier). Black Panther looks pretty accurate to the film, and I like Captain America without the mask.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Okay build, I just wanted to have it done to see the entire model, but not too bad.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>These look great, unusual wings on the jet, the truck and the motorcycle are cool for a chase scene.</p>

"Echolord","2016-05-15T16:22:22.15Z","""I'm done letting it consume me too.""","<p>The Captain America: Civil War sets have been, quite possibly, my most highly anticipated wave of sets yet. We got three awesome looking sets, with some great minifigure selections. The first weekend these sets were out, I rushed to Target and picked up both this set, and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76050-1/Crossbones-Hazard-Heist"">76050 Crossbones&#39; Hazard Heist</a>. I have intentionally withheld my review on these sets until after I saw the movie, so I could give an accurate review, based on both my own opinions, and the movie. Here we go!</p>

<p>(****SPOILER ALERT****) This scene does not exist in the movie. There is a similar scene in concept, where Bucky is driving a motorcycle&nbsp;through a traffic tunnel, with Black Panther chasing him, and Captain America behind him, but the jet and truck do not appear in this scene. I do not believe that the truck appears in this movie at all, but is a great vehicle nonetheless. The jet does appear later on, as he follows Iron Man to the Hydra Base, where he witnesses the battle between the Winter Soldier, Captain America, and Iron Man. Only the cockpit is visible through the fog, but it is evident that the vehicle is not a quinjet, and must be some sort of stealth jet for Panther. (****END SPOILERS****)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is slightly larger than that of Crossbones&#39; Hazard Heist, and looks even better. The graphics are very impressive, showing a nonexistent scene, that would have been very cool had it actually happened. All of the simple playability features are depicted on the box, and incorporated very well. The instructions are completed in a single booklet, withs some great graphics, and adds for LEGO AVENGERS, and the rest of the Civil War wave of sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Captain America: This might be the best Captain America minifigure to date. The torso and legs are the same as the Age of Ultron Cap, but that is excusable. The head is new, and is much better than the Obi-wan Kenobi head used on last year&#39;s version of the character. The hair is also new, using the mold introduced on Superman for the Batman v Superman sets, but now in nougat. The shield is the same red as the previous two years, sadly, as the dark red shield from 2012 would have looked much better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Black Panther: Wow. Just wow. This minifigure is incredible. The print is great, and the new ear piece, similar to the Darth Maul piece looks great! The minifigure is covered in silver printing, meant to represent the vibranium in his suit. His head has yellow/green/white eyes, that seem to change color depending on the angle. The silver detailing is continued onto his ear piece, and stretches back all the way to the ears themselves. The arms and legs are plain, which is okay, given the detail level of the rest of the minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Winter Soldier: This minifigure is somewhat disappointing. The head detracts so much from the overall appearance of the set. Why was Starlord&#39;s/Owen&#39;s head reused here? I mean, it looks decent, but next to Starlord, they look the same. If a rehashed head had to be used, use Poe Dameron&#39;s it&#39;s at least a little better. The torso is great though, with incredible, almost 3D printing. The vibranium arm looks much better than the promo figure from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, with some better printing to show the lines, and battle damage added to it. The red star on the shoulder is worn, and looks to be peeling slightly, but that might just be the printing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is really great, with some amazing new techniques used in the wings for the Black Panther jet. The use of purple elements looks very good, when mixed with the black, and there is a reasonable use of neon green in some locations. The truck is very simple, with a sturdy, quick build. A decent amount of stickers are used in the set, showing great detail.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great, and literally my only problem with the entire thing is the spring loaded shooter in the truck that takes up too much space in the seating area. The design of the jet is very sleek, and streamlined. A number of tiles and smooth pieces are used to detail the wings and nose of the vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>BUY IT! This set is amazing! The vehicles are great! The minifigures are great!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T16:19:03.93Z","A Black Panther Strikes","<p><strong>Set #76047 Black Panther Pursuit: </strong>Not accurate to the film or the scene where this happens I should say, but a decent looking LEGO set with some excellent Minifigure selection and some fun model designs. It&rsquo;s another great looking set from Civil War, in spite of what some might say and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: It&rsquo;s a great action shot on the front of the box showing that, yes, everyone in this set has their own specific vehicle, a rare sight indeed for LEGO Super Heroes. The back shows all the features, which aren&rsquo;t many, and another nice shot with Cap coming to Bucky&rsquo;s rescue, just like in the movie.</p>

<p>Instructions: A single manual for this set&rsquo;s three numbered bags includes all of the necessary steps to build all the models, naturally, and also features cross promotional images for the Civil War sets and the Avengers video game. You also get a comic included in the set which shows off all of the sets and the tale of Civil War in LEGO form, minus the ending of the actual movie to avoid spoilers, of course.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are some nice purple plates in this set, I&rsquo;d have to say the biggest element that MOC fans would enjoy is the inclusion of a black angled piece seen in LEGO Nexo Knights for the vehicles with large shield elements in their design, this new piece is mostly seen in blue in the Nexo Knights theme, so finding it here in black is a very welcome addition.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Black Panther: This one Minifigure is the best aspect of this set, sure you get a helmetless Cap and a MCU Winter Soldier in this set, but Black Panther looks awesome. He&rsquo;s got a great double-sided torso print with all these silver armour details, and his head features printing front and back to match with the costume detailing, the unique head piece to give him cat ears is also brilliant and features printing, and you get an extra in the set to boot.</p>

<p>The only problem is he doesn&rsquo;t include any accessories, and his legs are plain without any printing. Don&rsquo;t let that detract from your enjoyment of this figure though, he looks great and was a great character in the movie too.</p>

<p>Captain America: This version of Cap has the same body, but gets a new head, a flesh tone head with a hair piece, this means you have an unmasked Cap in a relatively cheap set, which is a great addition, his head is double-sided. You have a regular expression for neutral scenes and an angry shouting one. The hair piece is also brand new to this Minifigure, although I think it was also included with the helmetless Cap found in the SHIELD Helicarrier set.</p>

<p>Winter Soldier: This is definitely the MCU version of Winter Soldier, and it is a glorious looking Minifigure. His double-sided torso is very detailed with a holster strapped over his enhanced armour, and his arm, the silver one is also printed with a lot of detailing including the Russian star on his shoulder. For his accessory he gets a gun, a short pistol piece which I think we saw for the first time in LEGO Agents, although it kind of reminds me of the Grapple gun piece originally used in the 2006 LEGO Batman sets.</p>

<p>He has a double-sided facial print with two expressions, regular smiling face and tooth gritted expression of determination, he&rsquo;s ready to go into battle.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: This build is for Cap&rsquo;s truck, which is a relatively simply build and doesn&rsquo;t feature any tricky sections. The stickers used are just a few, one for the license plate and a pair of Taskforce logos, Cap took this truck from some military unit it would seem. Using the click joints for the side mirrors and the adjustable angle bricks for the front windshield is really impressive and a clever use of parts for the build.</p>

<p>Bag 2: You build a large portion of the Black Panther&rsquo;s jet here, the entire fuselage and one wing are included, considering the size of the finished model and how relatively easy it is I&rsquo;m left wondering why they even bothered to break it up. There is a lot of sticker use here for the wing detailing elements, this alone is the only part that might require help for younger builders to apply them properly.</p>

<p>Bag 3: The other wing is the bulk of the build here, you also put together Winter Soldier&rsquo;s motorcycle. I really don&rsquo;t understand why they put them in two different bags, it would have made more sense to include the bike in bag one and just build the whole jet in bag two. Anyway like with the last bag the placement of the stickers might have need of assistance.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Black Panther&rsquo;s Jet: This is the model that uses the most pieces in this set and it wasn&rsquo;t even the film for longer than a blink and you&rsquo;ll miss it cameo. LEGO did a great job with this though, it features a very interesting design for the swept back wings, and the stud launchers are hidden very well, so well you wouldn&rsquo;t even notice them there if you didn&rsquo;t look under the wings to fire on Winter Soldier as he escapes.</p>

<p>The cockpit is nicely designed too, I&rsquo;m a little disappointed that you use stickers for the control panel instead of having a printed piece there. It&rsquo;s interesting to see that you also have a fire extinguisher in case of emergency crash landings. The black and dark purple colouring makes this my favorite model in the set and, in my opinion, the best model out of the Civil War line that isn&rsquo;t a character build.</p>

<p>Cap&rsquo;s Truck: This model would be perfect if it didn&rsquo;t include a push loaded missile, which sticks through the front of the truck and pokes through anybody sitting in the passenger side. Other than that one problem for a play feature that really serves little purpose the model is fairly decent, I really like how they&rsquo;ve incorporated the new Dalek eyestalk piece for the construction of the headlights. It&rsquo;s a really solid vehicle and doesn&rsquo;t copy any build techniques on similar vehicles from other sets.</p>

<p>Winter Soldier&rsquo;s Bike: It&rsquo;s a LEGO Motorbike, no stickers this time, so nothing for detail work. It is a nice dark maroon for the chassis piece.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Marvel sets from 2016 were leaps above most of what we&rsquo;ve gotten from the DC Super Heroes portion of the set. I definitely recommend this set, it includes a great looking vehicle and some excellent Minifigures all for a very good price. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with any of the sets from Civil War, so again strongly recommened.</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-16T05:47:21.567Z","A nice if mainly unexciting set","<p>Overall this is a great little set. With some unexpectedly good builds and three must have minifigs for Marvel collectors. It&#39;s downside is the actual models feel a little small and blase. Like most Super Hero sets it really is all about the minifigs.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong> - Standard box with good art. Honestly this one is a little bland and rather resembles&nbsp;several other Marvel sets such as the Crossbones one. It doesn&#39;t really pop on the shelf the way others do. The instructions are folded paper booklets stuffed in the box and mangled. I do wish they would bag and board all the instructions instead of just the expensive set ones. Uncurling the instructions in order to use them is annoying.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures - </strong>We get three great if subdued minifigs. All from the Captain America Civil War movie.</p>

<p>Captain America - who is a mixed bag. His torso and legs are magnificent. In the highly detailed new suit from the movie. Front Printing, Back Printing, Leg Printing. Wonderful ballistic armor detailing. But then there&#39;s the head... Ugh! It&#39;s an almost generic Captain America unmasked head. It looks like Star Lord without the beard stuble. Add to this a hair piece that is just completely wrong in every way for Captain America, and no alternate cowled head that matches his new suit and bleah! His shield piece is a new print, with black lining between the colors that looks much sharper and crisper than the ones we have been getting.</p>

<p>The Winter Soldier - Bucky is the highpoint&nbsp;of the set as he is the only easily available Winter Soldier fig found in a set. He does not actually look quite as nice as the earlier Promotional Polybag from the&nbsp;Captain America: Winter Soldier movie. The torso print there was more interesting. But this one is serviceable enough. The face and head are pretty generic (Star Lord again). The hair is a good match for him although Dark Brown might have looked better. No leg printing. The robot arm is light bluish grey with silver and red printing. It might have looked a touch better as a pearl silver arm, but it works.</p>

<p>The Black Panther - The unique (so far) character to this set. T&#39;challa&nbsp;is nicely detailed. with front and back torso printing, no leg printing. He has a single face but front and back printed head and his ear piece. He looks great. His only downside is his printing in fine white and silver markings is a little subtle, so it doesn&#39;t stand out on the shelf like the more colorful characters do. But that&#39;s dead on for Black Panther.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build -&nbsp;</strong>There are two main components to the build. The Jeep and Black Panthers Jet. Of them the Jeep is fairly bland and generic. About the only thing interesting in it is using the new 3mm peg studs to create the headlights. Otherwise it goes on the pile with all the other Jeep type cars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where the set shines is Black Panthers Jet. The box doesn&#39;t do justice to what a cool and complex little build it is. With tons of SNOT builds and some neat use of angling on the wings. It was far more complex and fun to build than I was expecting. The purple trim colors really do pop. And the included stickers add a lot to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;It&#39;s a nice little ~$20 set. Not great, and nothing outside of the figures that will be added to your permanent display. But the Jet is nicely swooshable and scales extremely well with the Hawkeye one from the Avengers Helicarrier set from way back. Let&#39;s be honest, your gonna get it for the minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was my first Civil War set and I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a good one to start with. You get three minifigures, a jet , a jeep/truck and a motorcycle.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Museo Slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box was pretty good, not movie accurate but still really cool looking. The instructions were thicker than I was expecting, but other than that, they were pretty typical instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is a treasure trove of cool parts. A spring loaded shooter, cool new cockpit, purple pieces, angles, tires and much more. Plenty to work with, should you decide to take the set apart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set includes three minifigures: Bucky/Winter Soldier, Captain America and Black Panther.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Captain America has the same torso and legs as the previous ones, but now his mask is absent. He has a new face print that looks super good and you can finally make him have some other expression than SMILING!!! The smiling face on this Cap is more of a smirk, and Cap doesn&rsquo;t usually smirk but it looks good nonetheless. His hair is the same as the new Superman, but in the dark blond or nougat or whatever it&rsquo;s official name is. I don&rsquo;t think this hairpiece really suits him, but I&rsquo;ll talk about that more in a minute. His shield is the brighter red version and I know a lot of people would prefer the darker but I think the dark one is too dark. Maybe if they had an in-between color. Also it&rsquo;d be nice if Lego had made the white on the shield silver. Now, back to the hair issue. Cap&rsquo;s hair never really looks all swooped to the side like that. The color is perfect, just not the style. If you have Star-Lord, then I suggest you switch their hairpieces. The swooped-to-the-side one looks better on Star-Lord and the regular hair looks better on Cap. So overall, minus the hairpiece, he looks much better than all the others combined&hellip;oh wait, he is, in a sense&hellip;anyway, he looks awesome.</p>

<p>(no, Star-Lord is not included with this set)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Winter Soldier aka Bucky finally appears in a set that&rsquo;s not a super exclusive seventy dollar polybag. Most of his printing is better than his polybag version. His arm is silver with contour printing and a red, chipped and dented up Soviet star. His body is printed with a holster and military style body armor. His legs unfortunately have no printing. Bucky&rsquo;s face is Star-Lord&rsquo;s face re-used (wait a minute: Cap with Star-Lord&rsquo;s hair, Bucky with Star-Lord&rsquo;s face&hellip;I&rsquo;m starting to see a pattern here). Eh. It isn&rsquo;t the best face for him, especially next to Star-Lord or Owen. I&rsquo;ve heard some people suggest using Poe Damron&rsquo;s face and maybe that might be better. 4/5 stars. Oh, I forgot: Bucky&rsquo;s accessory is the semi-rare sub machine handgun piece. Also, his hairpiece is the same as the polybag version and it is pretty common but it fits perfectly.</p>

<p>Black Panther is exclusive to this set and he looks fantastic! Instead of the Batman-like mask that some people may have been expecting, he has his mask printed one his face and he wears a headpiece similar to Darth Maul&rsquo;s horns. The printing on his head continues on the back and the detail is astounding. There is a tiny bit of printing on his &ldquo;ears&rdquo;. On his torso, you can see shiny pieces of his vibranium armor and again, the detail level is amazing. He has no printing on his legs, but I think it isn&rsquo;t necessary and he looks good without it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun, with lots of cool building techniques to try, especially on Black Panther&rsquo;s jet. The way Lego has you attach the wings blew me away! It&rsquo;s super clever and definitely worth trying out on jets of your own. Cap&rsquo;s truck is a neat build as well. Bucky&rsquo;s motorcycle isn&rsquo;t really a build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>So, now we&rsquo;ve got all the completed builds. I&rsquo;ll start with the motorcycle. The frame is silver, just like Hawkeye&rsquo;s motorcycle in The Tanker Truck Takedown and it looks good. The body of the bike is dark red and you add a trans-clear pip (single stud) as a headlight. I really like the addition of the motorcycle since Bucky uses a motorcycle multiple times in the movie and the frame looks like the one he uses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cap&rsquo;s truck isn&rsquo;t movie accurate but I still really enjoyed it. I especially like the &ldquo;Taskforce&rdquo; sticker that references the taskforce that Agent 13 was a part of. There is a spring-loaded shooter hidden in the front and to fire it, you press the end of the missile that sticks over the passenger seat. I&rsquo;ve heard that some people didn&rsquo;t like this function because it didn&rsquo;t allow for a passenger, but if you just remove the missile, then you could fit another person. There is a few stickers on the truck, but if you are careful then they&rsquo;re not too hard to get on &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;right. I really like how Lego used the banister piece for the windshield. It looks different than Lego&rsquo;s other trucks/jeeps and I like that. Overall, 4/5. It&rsquo;s cool and Cap looks good driving it.</p>

<p>Now we finally come to Black Panther&rsquo;s jet. The whole thing is just so solid, sleek and well designed. It looks like a bird of prey. The color scheme isn&rsquo;t exactly like the one in the movie, but the black and purple make it look very stealthy. And purple is always nice to get. On the wings, there are some stickers with some symbols and silver detail. The front tip uses a piece that came out with the Nexo Knights line, but here it&rsquo;s re-colored in black. The set includes some extra purple cheese wedges that look good when you add them to the tail fin. The cockpit features a new windscreen design that is awesome. Inside the cockpit is a control panel with a sticker that is really hard to get right because you can&rsquo;t really tell which side is up. You can see I got mine upside down. Behind the seat is a fire extinguisher and around the control panel is some lime green highlights. Under each wing is a nicely disguised stud shooter. The jet looks good from pretty much every angle.</p>

<p>FINAL VERDICT</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: Captain America</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Black Panther</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bucky</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sweet stealth jet</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;motorcycle</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cap&rsquo;s Truck</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;good price</p>

<p>Cons: Bucky&rsquo;s face</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;not movie accurate, but this doesn&rsquo;t bother me that much.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;some tough stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall well designed with good detail. I definitely recommend that you buy it. The jet could be swooshed around for hours!</p>
