"Bobsy","2016-02-17T17:01:52.533Z","A worthy set, but not without flaws","<p>There&#39;s no getting away from the sense that this set represents a deliberate response on Marvel&#39;s part to the release of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76028-1/Darkseid-Invasion"">76028-1: Darkseid Invasion</a>. The similarities are obvious: large white space jet manned by superheroes going up against a bigfig of a top-tier villain of its respective universe. And Darkseid Invasion already has the upper hand with a visibly sleeker main vehicle compared to the noticeably more boxy Avenjet, as well as more substantial transport for the big villain.</p>

<p>Still, that doesn&#39;t make the Avenjet a bad model in its own right, just that it&#39;s got stiff competition from the get-go.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not exactly controversial to bemoan the use of stickers over printed pieces, so it&#39;s a little surprising to see both make a strong showing here. Most of the logos and details are stickers, but the large turbines on each wing are printed. This isn&#39;t as good as it sounds though, as it still shows them up as being flat and two-dimensional. Turbines are hard to render in bricks of course, but it&#39;s difficult to not to think there must have been some better solution out there. Considering it&#39;s not exactly the first time decent turbines have been needed on <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6869-1/Quinjet-Aerial-Battle"">a Marvel set</a>... maybe it&#39;s worth investing in a new part or two?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>First off, the boring: Captain America is not only the same as in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76048-1/Iron-Skull-Sub-Attack"">76048-1: Iron Skull Sub Attack</a> (with a ridiculous star-spangled air tank thrown in). Only of interest if you don&#39;t already own another version of Cap.</p>

<p>And because this is a Marvel set, there needs to be (by law or something) either a cameo by Iron Man or Spider-man. It&#39;s the former we get here, and he at least has the decency to appear in a different colour suit to normal. He&#39;s in space, so obviously the suit needs to be white. That&#39;s just science. But like Cap, there&#39;s really nothing to get excited by here.</p>

<p>You know what is exciting though? Captain Marvel.</p>

<p>Captain <em><a href=""http://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Rocket-Raccoon-VS-Chewie-the-Cat-1-580x348.png"">Flerken</a> </em>Marvel! I make it a point to never buy a set purely for the minifigs, but the sheer awesomeness of Carol Danvers&#39; Lego incarnation is the closest I&#39;ve come yet. The torso and leg printing is superb, and while the short spiky haircut won&#39;t be to everyone&#39;s liking, Carol&#39;s hair length is notably inconsistent anyway. An alternate masked head is provided, but sadly not a blond mohawk to go with it. It&#39;s a sad indictment of LEGO&#39;s policy with superhero minifigs that this is probably the only time we&#39;re going to get a Captain Marvel fig for some years to come, and it&#39;s tucked away in a &pound;50 set.</p>

<p>On the villain side we have a bigfig of Thanos The Mad Titan and Hyperion. Thanos is... okay enough. Honestly he&#39;d probably have been fine as a regular minifig, but he hardly looks bad. Just a bit plain, considering it&#39;s one of the most important villains in Marvel Comics. As for Hyperion... well, if you were looking for more proof that this was a response to DC&#39;s set, how about a minifig of a villainous expy of Superman himself? Hyperion looks pretty decent, with t-shirt arms and a unique shaped cape (made of the old stiff cloth, which I definitely prefer). He even uses the exact same double-sided head as Superman used, with glowing heat-ray eyes on one side.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing particularly complex while building the Avenjet or Thanos&#39;s space-skates. There are a few instances of SNOT, especially in order to put the sides on the two cockpits, but there&#39;s nothing that stands out as an exciting technique or altogether challenging.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The real test is whether the blockier, boxier look of the Avenjet is still a good-looking and fun model and toy. Thankfully I can report that it is, although the aforementioned flaws never really go away. It&#39;s blocky because it&#39;s a more down-to-earth (sorry) take on a space vehicle than the more fantastical <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76028-1/Darkseid-Invasion"">Javelin</a>. Taken on it&#39;s own merits, the Avenjet still looks good and is as much fun to swoosh around as any decent spaceship.</p>

<p>Scale is an issue though. Smaller than both Quinjets released so far, it&#39;s a rather dinky ship for a &pound;50 pricetag, barely the size of a Star Wars starfighter (and dwarfed by the recent X-Wing and TIE Fighter from TFA). That said, it does size up well next to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76021-1/The-Milano-Spaceship-Rescue"">Milano</a>, as well as the more compact starfighters that Lego&#39;s own space lines tend to put out.</p>

<p>The main gimmick of the Avenjet is that the upper part of the ship detaches into an even smaller fighter. It&#39;s decent enough, and I&#39;m a real sucker for vehicles that dock with other vehicles, but the mini-fighter is very small on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>I have a particular bugbear about cockpits with gaps between the pilot and the bleak horror that is outer space, so it&#39;s disappointing also to see that both cockpit canopies leave a significant gap when they close. In addition, the landing gear (such as it is) doubles up as flick-fire launchers. Considering the stud-launchers on top are far better, it&#39;s weird seeing flick-fires still in use at all.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If Captain Marvel hadn&#39;t been included, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have forked out the requisite &pound;50 for this set. For some the draw will be the Thanos bigfig, or the unique Iron Man armour. But there won&#39;t be a huge number of people after this set for the Avenjet itself, which is of course where most of your money goes.</p>

<p>Which is a shame, as it&#39;s not a bad set in the least. It&#39;s a fun, swooshable alternative to yet <em>another </em>Quinjet (and considering they&#39;re getting <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76051-1/Super-Hero-Airport-Battle"">smaller every time</a>, this is probably merciful). Where this set suffers is as a hook to sell certain characters that wouldn&#39;t warrant their own smaller set, and that&#39;s a shame. There&#39;s no reason why the Avenjet doesn&#39;t deserve a place on your shelf, but at the same time, it&#39;s a far from perfect set.</p>

<p>Oh, and on the matter of which is better, this or <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76028-1/Darkseid-Invasion"">76028-1: Darkseid Invasion</a>? Bare in mind that the other set costs a hefty &pound;10 more. Pity the poor kid that asks for Superman&#39;s spacejet, and gets Captain America&#39;s. It&#39;s even got the &#39;wrong&#39; Captain Marvel!</p>

"TK_1308","2016-09-04T19:38:46.183Z","""The Avengers will fall!""","<p>Lego continues to release kits from the Marvel animated shows with the Avenjet Space Mission from Avengers Assemble.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The standard mid range size rectangular box for a kit in this price range. Price per piece ratio is as expected for a kit of this size.<br />
Iron Man is the figure of choice on the top with a battle scene of all 5 figures next to him. The front of the box shows the heroes and villains battling each other in outer space. The back shows the Avenjet on Thanos&#39; asteroid engaged in combat with 6 more panels showing the play features.&nbsp;<br />
One nice thick almost square instruction manual and the obligatory comic, showcasing this set and the Iron Skull Sub Attack inside.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice number of parts for a kit of this size with a mix of colours present although mainly it&#39;s red and white. It also included some nice new pieces I haven&#39;t had in my collection before like the clear red engine pieces used to indicate the thrusters on the aft section.&nbsp;<br />
There are 4 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains Captain America, Thanos and the Avenjet Fighter.<br />
Bag 2 contains Iron Man and the lower main hull of the Avenjet.<br />
Bag 3 contains Hyperion and the main wings and upper hull for the Avenjet.<br />
Bag 4 contains Captain Marvel, the front section for the Avenjet, armaments, detailing and Cap&#39;s space backpack.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with 4 minifigures and a large scale figure.<br />
Firstly we have Captain America. This is the same as the one in Iron Skull Sub Attack and has nice reflective silver detailing and printing on the head and torso. He comes equipped with breathing apparatus, a space thruster pack (in red, white and blue!) And his trusty shield.<br />
Secondly we have the Mark 39 Gemini Armour Iron Man. Decked out in white with gold and silver detailing, this is a great minifigure and the light blue repulsar effects add to the overall look. Tony has the same two sided head used before with the smiling / angry faces.<br />
Next we have Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel. This is a great minifigure and the gold metallic detailing on the torso print is very eye catching. She has the two sided head with smiling / angry faces and also an alternate red masked head piece as well.<br />
Onto the villains and we start with Hyperion. Another great figure with the two-tone areas on both his arms and legs, combined with great printing make for another nice Marvel minifigure. His single shoulder cape in gold is a nice touch. He has a two sided head with smiling / red laser eyes faces - much like Superman.<br />
Finally, we have the large scale Thanos figure. It&#39;s been a long time coming and he is a welcome addition to the growing ranks of villains now available. He comes equipped with repulsar boots for each foot and each of these is armed with a stud shooter and light pink clear disc blasts.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 30 minutes.<br />
It&#39;s a very straightforward build with nothing very complicated in the construction.<br />
The use of side panels and S.N.O.T. techniques give the ship a very sturdy design and functional look. This is carried on into the wing construction and is done in such a way to make sure the wings are not easily dislodged.<br />
It&#39;s very flyable for kids and carries a lot of weapons. The lift mechanism for securing the Fighter is also nicely designed and quite secure when the two ships are docked.<br />
There are stickers, 17 in total, which are primarily detailing, consoles and logos. There is one on the fighter and the rest are on the Avenjet.</p>

<h3>The completed models</h3>

<p>The Avenjet is a nice looking craft and well designed to be a solid, playable, flyable toy for kids as well as a good display piece for adults.<br />
The Avenjet features opening cockpit which seats one figure, positionable front section, lift section to attach Fighter, external clips for Cap&#39;s shield and back pack, positionable wing tips and comes armed with 5 clear blue round tipped flick missiles. There is an open middle section in which you could put Iron Man, but a hatch on the bottom might have been a nice touch. It&#39;s not as big or imposing as the first couple of Quinjets but it&#39;s still a nice looking and well detailed craft. It measures 28 cm long, a wingspan of 27 cm and stands 6.5 cm tall without the fighter attached.<br />
The Fighter features opening cockpit which seats one figure, positionable wing tips and two wing mounted stud launchers with 4 clear blue disc blasts. It looks more like a small glider / fighter and fits nicely with the main ship. Another very flyable craft for kids. It measures 10 cm long, a wingspan of 20.5 cm and stands 4.5 cm tall.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A superb set and a definite must have for any Marvel collector simply for the minifigure selection alone. It looks great with any of the other Avengers kits and you can finally add Thanos to your Avengers or Guardians Of The Galaxy displays. Best get one before they disappear faster than an Infinity Stone.</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-16T07:03:58.877Z","This one surprised me. Much better than it looked on the box","<p>This one snuck up on me. I had avoided it, because the box art made it look crude. Very blocky and not what I was expecting from a modern Super Heroes set. But it went on sale and I got it for the minifigs. I was rather pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions -&nbsp;</strong>First up, the box does not do this set justice. In the box art it looks more like a retro Classic Lego Space design. Rather crude and blocky. The instructions are a small square bound book with a nice sticker sheet. Still somewhat rolled up (why dont they bag and board all the instructions to prevent in the box mangling!?!?!)&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>A nice broad assortment of useful parts. Nothing particularly rare or outstanding. Stud shooters, lots of snot pieces. Lots of red and white.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>What we are probably here for. Some fantastic figures. With a few characters never seen before in Lego.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanos - The centerpiece of the figures is the Thanos Bigfig. he is about the same size and general pose as the Hulk Bigfigs. painted in dark blue and pearl gold, witha &nbsp;well shaped head sporting a smiling lavender face. Honestly his smile is a bit too jolly, but its Lego. He overall has that nice &quot;Kirby&#39;esque&quot; feel to him. He has a small build of some sort of space rocket boots with stud shooters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Space Captain America - Yeah this is the worst fig in the set. It is Scuba Cap from the Iron Skull set, just with a little ugly brick built backpack. It has 2 cool Cap star printed 1x1 round tiles. Otherwise the figure is the same including the rebreather. Although the rebreather does not fit properly because it needs to be stacked with the clear back attachment bracket around his neck. Weak fig, not unique to this set, and badly executed in this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Space Iron Man - Iron Man&#39;s white Space Armor, essentially a Lego version of the &quot;Gemini&quot; armor from IM3. He&#39;s white with fine black and gold printing. Torso front and back and leg printing. His helmet is white with a brighter and lighter shade of gold on the visor than the regular red Iron Man figs. Sadly no outer armor although he does have a neck bracket that holds two trans blue 1x1 tiles representing thrusters. Not quite as cool as the Deep Sea Iron Man figure, but the next best thing. A must have for Iron Man collectors or those building a Hall of Armor.</p>

<p>Captain Marvel - Carol Danvers finally gets a Minifigure!!! It&#39;s her modern Captain Marvel suit (as opposed to her more classic Ms. Marvel look). It&#39;s sharp crisp printing with front and back torso printing and leg printing. Only complaint is the gold areas get a little too washed out and toned down on top of the blue plastic. She comes with two heads. Mask/Helmet on and a bare flesh Mask/Helmet off. (her mask is her space helmet. She only wears it in space.) The bare flesh head has two faces. Her red masked head only one. And then there is her hair... dear lord what were they thinking? She gets the tousled &quot;Sleepyhead&quot; hair in yellow blonde. It&#39;s not an ideal fit. If anyone is looking to custom her up a bit her hair should be a longer blonde in unmasked version. When her helmet is on only the top strip of her hair sticks through giving her a mohawk look. Overall Carol is a Must Have figure for a collector. She is a core well known Avenger and this is her first and only minifig appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hyperion - Wow! Talk about including an obscure character, completely out of left field? On the positive side, he looks glorious. Fantastic Red and Gold printing. Dual sided torso, printed legs, two unique faces, two color arms! pearl gold! And that custom cut off one shoulder cape. he is an amazing fig. It&#39;s just that nobody would ever know who the heck Hyperion is. (yes yes I know this set is sort of based on one of the cartoons.) Quasar would have probably been a better choice, or Nova. But damn if Hyperion isn&#39;t good looking. The minifig that you never knew you wanted until you got him in hand. Expect to spend 20 minutes looking up who the heck he is on Google.</p>

<p><strong>The Model/Build -&nbsp;</strong>Here is where the set completely took &nbsp;me by surprise. From the box it looked crude and old school. Something that would not blend well with the glorious Avengers Quinjets and the Milano. And while true, the truth is, in hand, it really is a superb set and a really fun build. This thing is just fun. Some surprisingly clever builds. It&#39;s packed with play features. It&#39;s incredibly swooshable. and in a strange way it goes cross theme. Being a good match for Lego Space themes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>Fans of Lego super Heroes will like this set. Younger fans will adore it for just how amazingly fun it is. But fans of Lego Space, especially fans of the departed Galaxy Squad theme will be in complete love with it. This is, completely unmodified except leaving off the stickers, the Red Team Large Vehicle that the GS fans always begged for. Loads of detail. Stud shooters and flick fires. Separates into two (or even three if you are creative) ships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has a great ship. Far better than it looks on the box. Add to that 3 major heroes, a MAJOR Bigfig Villain, and an obscure powerful character that can be both a hero and a villain (often at the same time, &#39;ol Hyperion is a bit of a hot headed moron.) And you have one of the highest play value sets released all year. This one is going on my long term display shelf. Near my desk where I can pick it up and play with it. I was NOT expecting that. Well done Lego.&nbsp;</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-17T15:21:57.847Z","Avenjet Space Mission Review","<p>The Avenjet&nbsp;Space Mission set is an awesome set from the Marvel Superheroes theme. It includes the Avenjet, 4 minifigures, and a bigfig. It was released in 2016 for&nbsp;$59.99 and has 523 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Captain America- </strong>This minifigure uses basic printing for comic book Captain America. This version of Captain America has a head that fits for him being in space. He also come with a jet pack that has 2 printed stars on it. 6/10</p>

<p><strong>Space Iron Man- </strong>This Minifigure is an awesome version of Iron Man. It&#39;s a space iron suit that has great printing that looks really good. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Captain Marvel- </strong>This is a great minifigure that has never been made until this set. Her printing looks incredible and has a separate&nbsp;head for her mask. On her unmasked head she has a double sided face.&nbsp;10/10</p>

<p><strong>Hyperion- </strong>I don&#39;t know much about this character but he is a great minifigure. His printing is good and he has a weird shape for his cape that I like. He also has a double sided face. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Thanos- </strong>This is the first Thanos to be released in Lego and he is a nice Bigfig. He has decent printing and includes boots. 8/10</p>

<p><strong>Build&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Avenjet is a fantastic build that has good play features. The top can come off to become a separate ship. The front can move up and down and the wing tips can move up and down also. The Avenjet has flick fire missiles and stud shooters good for playability. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set has a great build and awesome minifigures. The printing on all of them look great and this set has exclusive minifigures. This set is great for playability but also looks good on display. The play feature with the top coming off a great&nbsp;play feature.&nbsp;In my opinion this is a great set.</p>
