"TK_1308","2016-03-02T13:27:48.547Z","""These people that shoot at you, usually wind up shooting at me, too.""","<p>The first sets from the expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe bring us some great new characters. The Crossbones&#39; Hazard Heist is no exception.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mid size box. Black Widow is the figure of choice on the top. The front shows Black Widow and Falcon attacking Crossbones in his jeep and the back shows a battle scene with several panels indicating all the play features.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. Some nice pieces in the set and some good colours have been included including the dark / mid browns and some khaki. For me, Falcon&#39;s exo-suit made this a must have purchase.<br />
There are two bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains Black Widow, Falcon, the gun turret (which can go on top of the jeep, Widow&#39;s motorcycle and the containers for the back of the jeep.<br />
Bag 2 contains Crossbones and his jeep.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with Crossbones, Black Widow and Falcon. The detailing for the torso on all the figures is superb and Widow has detailing on her legs as well.&nbsp;<br />
Crossbones comes armed with a flame shooting gun and there are a variety of weapons on his vehicle that he can use as well. The mask and head details are well done.<br />
Black Widow comes with her two staff weapons, represented by simple blue lightsaber blades. Her head has printing on both sides, smiling and fighting faces.<br />
The best of the set for me is Sam Wilson as Falcon. The wings have some nice details and the thrust pack on the back can detach like a mini drone, similar to the one in 2012&#39;s 6869 Quinjet Aerial Battle. He comes armed with 2 twin barrelled pistols. His head has printing on both sides, smiling and fighting faces. I&#39;ve wanted this figure since The Winter Soldier came out so he is a most welcome addition to my Avengers series.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 15 minutes.<br />
Nothing unusual in the build itself and a very straightforward kit with regards to construction. Similar build to the SH.I.E.L.D. Jeep from 2012&#39;s Cosmic Cube Escape. The vehicle has some nice elements and ideas to portray the almost junk pile / scrap parts welded together design.<br />
Yes, there are stickers, 12 in total, but the add some nice details to the overall look giving scoring marks and dents on some of the panels.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Crossbones&#39; jeep is a nice sturdy vehicle and good for kids to play with. It&#39;s a somewhat ramshackle affair and it will be interesting to see how it holds up against its on-screen counterpart, if it appears on screen at all.<br />
There is a rifle which clips onto the side by the door opening, removable roof panel / gun turret with the twin stud shooters (with 4 orange disc blasts) and the containers at the back can &#39;explode off&#39; as they are resting on a hinged plate. Inside the containers is a small green suitcase with something else that the rogue has stolen. It uses the same tyres as seen on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeep from 2012&#39;.<br />
Black Widow&#39;s motorcycle is the same design as the one in 2015&#39;s Quinjet City Chase but this time comes with red trim, detailing and a tidier design for the weapon clip on the back.<br />
The jeep measures 13 cm long, 6.5 cm wide and 10 cm high.<br />
The motorbike measures 6.5 cm long, 2 cm wide and 3 cm tall.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A really nice set and worth it just for the minifigures. Much like previous MCU sets in the &pound;20 range, a vehicle and a few minifigures seems to be the idea but this one is a little better with the inclusion of the motorcycle for Black Widow.<br />
As with all previous releases, there is a mini comic included with the set. If you collect Super Hero kits then this is a must have purchase.</p>

"RavenLee126","2016-03-14T17:31:08.073Z","Overall-An OK Set ","<p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe is quickly expanding, and so naturally, Lego is&nbsp;keeping up. Crossbones&#39; Hazard Heist is one of three &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; sets Lego has produced. Although I&#39;d have to say, the smallest of the Civil War sets is arguably the worst of the three. Here&#39;s why:&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is on the smaller side and has a large picture on the front showing the characters in action and the Marvel and &quot;Captain America: Civil War&quot; logos.&nbsp;The sides show the minifigs and additional Lego info. The back shows the play features and the logos again. Inside is a small comic which may have some spoilers&nbsp;of the movie, so I will not go into detail. On the back of the comic a list of chargers from the Civil War sets are shown which is a cool feature. There are two medium size bags and the set of instructions are clear and easy to read. The first bag is the construction of Black Widow, her motorcycle, Falcon, his jet-pack, and the top of the Crossbones&#39; jeep. The second bag contains the pieces for Crossbones, his weapons, and the completion of his jeep.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 179 parts, along with some extra smaller parts. Not many unique parts except for Falcon&#39;s new wing piece, what appears to be a new style gun that Crossbones has, and the dark orange pieces that are a little rare.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are three superb&nbsp;minifigures included in this set. But, each of them have some flaws.</p>

<p><strong>Black Widow</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally! Black Widow is not included in the most expensive set of the group! The Black Widow included in this set is&nbsp;the same minfigure that is included in&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76032-1/The-Avengers-Quinjet-City-Chase"">76032-1: The Avengers Quinjet City Chase</a>. She is excellently printed minfig&nbsp;with front and back torso printing, and leg printing. She has a reversible head and the expressions (grinning and a scowl)&nbsp;suit her character well. However, in the &#39;Civil War&#39; trailers Natasha has longer hair than in Age of Ultron, so a different hair piece would have been nice. It&#39;s understandable why they kept it the same, as it is easier to produce the same exact minfigure. Black Widow is equipped two translucent blue staff pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Falcon</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ever since the &quot;Captain America: The&nbsp;Winter Soldier&quot; movie, I&#39;ve been excited for a Sam Wilson AKA The Falcon minifigure. Upon getting the minifig&nbsp;in the flesh, I had mixed emotions about it. The minfigure uses the same hair as <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/sw676/Finn"">Finn</a> from the Star Wars the Force Awakens product line and&nbsp;I think it is&nbsp;perfect for Falcon. The head is also reversible and has two emotions, grinning and a determined battle ready face. The head also has Falcon&#39;s goggles, and the way they show his eyes is excellent. The torso has very good quality printing both front and back; although it is printed on a light grey torso and the back printing is covered by his wing piece. The torso&nbsp;should have been dark grey. Falcon&#39;s arms are not covered in the movies, and some light brown arms would have looked better. The legs are just plain dark grey, and some printing would have been nice. Falcon comes with a new wing piece which I think is an excellent representation of what it looks like. However, his jet-pack&nbsp;that attaches is a little too bulky in my opinion. A smaller version would have looked better. Overall, a couple big flaws, but still a good minfigure. He comes equipped with two black guns.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Crossbones</strong>:</p>

<p>The final minifigure is the most disappointing of the set. Crossbones has only been seen a little bit in trailers and leaked set photos, but he is seen with a helmet, and mainly black suit. The minifig does represent him well. The torso is the only decent thing about it. It features front and back detailed printing. The head has big yellow eyes that look very out of place. A helmet would have looked much better. The legs are plain dark grey which are not only inaccurate, but are also completely plain with no printing. Crossbones&nbsp;is equipped with an odd looking flame thrower.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build was relatively short, about 10-15&nbsp;minutes. No tricky construction.&nbsp;The build contains 12 stickers, that were placed in odd places on Crossbones&#39; jeep, maybe to represent scratches? It is a&nbsp;quick,&nbsp;easy build with simple construction.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>The completed model includes Crossbones&#39; jeep, a motorcycle for Black Widow and some accessories. The motorcycles is similar to the one in&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76032-1/The-Avengers-Quinjet-City-Chase"">76032-1: The Avengers Quinjet City Chase</a>&nbsp;but with red parts that look a little out of place. One of Widow&#39;s staffs can be clipped on to the back of the motorcycle. The jeep is a little... odd. The color scheme is black and orange, which is a bit weird. The guns on top were obviously included as a play feature, but they never-the-less look very out of place. There are exposed studs and the placement and color is just not right. There is a clip for a gun on the side of the jeep, and storage in the back for what appears to be some sort of poison. Overall, the jeep has a nice design and great play features, but messy details and color. We&#39;ll know in a few months if this actually appears in the movie or not.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this is a nice set for kids 10 and under. I would say don&#39;t get this set unless you want the minifigs.&nbsp;It does have&nbsp;great play features for kids and is a quick, fun, easy build, but is not a great set for TFOL&#39;s or AFOL&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2016-08-05T21:11:33.073Z","The Runt of the Litter","<p>You can be honest here. You&#39;re among friends. You buy sets just for the minifigures. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of those sets. It&#39;s not that there&#39;s anything particularly wrong with the build, it&#39;s just that there&#39;s not anything particularly right with it either.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just as you&#39;d expect for a &pound;20 set: normal sized box with the odd &quot;POW!!!!!&quot; plastered across the back and one stapled instruction booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Actually one of the high points. Some nice colours, including a fair bit of what I believe is one of the nougats, and the translucent domes are cool too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>What you came for.</p>

<p>Crossbones: Not the most movie-accurate, I&#39;ll admit, but still nice. His suit does look distinctly lower-tech than in the movie, but the printing is nice enough to keep me happy.</p>

<p>Black Widow: Uuuh.... I guess Lego saw the cast here and thought it was another Avengers movie, because good old Nat doesn&#39;t look quite right. At all. Perfectly accurate to AoU, just not here. It is however, the only way to obtain her in this wave.&nbsp;I personally gave her Agent 13&#39;s jacket, which goes some way towards improving her.</p>

<p>Falcon: The real highlight. Torso printing is great, though some on the legs wouldn&#39;t go amiss, the head and hair are excellent, and the wings are wonderful. Just don&#39;t bother attaching the Redwing drone.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quick. Despite its size, there isn&#39;t a huge amount to the truck, so it&#39;s not the most exciting of builds.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s OK, I guess. The truck is fairly accurate for what it is, but didn&#39;t really feature in the movie. Rumlow drove an Audi. The back bit&nbsp;with the chemical thing is pretty cool, though.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s no denying that the Civil War line has produced some great models. This, unfortunately, isn&#39;t one of them - perhaps due to its lack of a magic&nbsp;red fire extinguisher. However,&nbsp;&pound;20 is (for me) cheap enough to justify buying something for the figs. And for that, it&#39;s great. Just don&#39;t expect much from the build.</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-16T07:26:22.497Z","A great little low cost set. Lots to do. Surprisingly good build and play features","<p>Crossbones Hazard Heist is the scene from Captain America Civil War early on where Black Widow and Falcon are chasing down Crossbones to recover a stolen bioweapon. Crossbones in a Jeep, Widow on a Superbike and Falcon flying with Redwing. The set is extremely basic. But well executed for what it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>The set has a nice assortment of rare or unusual parts. Widows Cycle is a new mold. Falcons wings are new. Lots of unexpected parts go into the Jeep.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>The Falcon - Sam Wilson in his gray tactical gear with burgundy trim, He has a well printed torso, those glorious wings (the grey metal ones not the trans red energy ones) and the Red Wing drone tucked into his wing pack. he has 2 faces and&nbsp;a well matched hair piece, possibly unique to himself. (short tight afro/curly hair). Sam is a Must Have for Marvel collectors.</p>

<p>Black Widow - A nice new all around print. Front, back and leg printing. A new face. New better matching hair, and a pair of trans blue lightsaber type fighting sticks. She also gets Lego&#39;s new Superbike model, done up in black and red trim with avengers stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Crossbones - Our bad guy is played by Red Skull worshiping former Shied traitor Brock Rumlow. He has good torso printing front and back. A nice head and his legs are not printed. He also gets a rebreather piece in white.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Model/Build -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The main build is Crossbones modified off road truck. It was actually a far more complex build than I was expecting. With a lot of texturing and detail. While it is yet another Superhero Jeep, it&#39;s one of the better ones. With some actual thought into it. It tells its own story. There are enough components to play out a little scene with poison canisters, roof guns, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;While not one of the amazing over the top large sets. This is a damn fine small set. A great gift for a child or nephew. It has great figures, and some fun play possibilities at a good price.&nbsp;</p>

"MFT_Kyle","2016-03-26T13:58:00.183Z","Crossbones Comes Away with a Win","<p>From the second I saw the original images of the set, I knew it was a must-have. Between the Crossbones minifigure (which reminded me of a mark darker, drearier Trick-or-Treater CMF) and the burnt orange and black of the primary Jeep-like vehicle, there was no hesitation once the box was before me. As far as I was concerned, Falcon, Black Widow, and the Avengers motorcycle were all welcome extras.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With the exception of Crossbones&#39; new gun and Falcon&#39;s wings, it does not appear that there are any exclusive pieces to this set. Having said that, there are a few rare pieces such as both pieces involved in the motorcycle, the black rims of Crossbones&#39; jeep, and all of those orange-brown pieces which appear few other places. While those pieces do not appear with much density, they might be of special interest to AFOLS in search of more earthy tones.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The primary reason I bought the set was for the Crossbones minifigure and I was not disappointed by him in the end. With strong detailing on the chest and head, the lack of printed legs on Crossbones can be forgiven. Falcon is also terrific with the newly-printed wing piece though the detachable drone of his &quot;mech suit&quot; is a bit much and pushes the figure to an irrational width. Black Widow&#39;s printing is also solid and the orange hair piece can be of particular interest to those custom minifigure-makers of the world.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was simple enough, on par with the typical $20 superhero set. The most interesting parts were applying the grill, hood, and windows of Crossbones&#39; vehicle as they are certainly the most attention-grabbing details of the set in my own opinion. Also, I had never built that style of motorcycle before and was pleased with its construction. The division of the set into two bags - the first which builds Falcon, Black Widow, the motorcycle, and the play features of the vehicle, and the second of which builds Crossbones and his Jeep, was effective but not necessary. A focused twenty minutes seems about as much time as it takes. With about a dozen stickers, they feel a bit exhaustive on such a small build, though I must admit they all look great.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I came into this set with high hopes and was only slightly disappointed as a whole. The minifigures and play features both lived up to my great expectations but the vehicle itself felt rather light and hollow compared to the action-packed image on the box. While this is not an unusual reaction to a superhero set, its loud design restricts its usage among any other theme without being a sore thumb, even with the hazard containers and turret removed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite the small issue with Crossbones&#39; vehicle, I&#39;d be quick to recommed the set to anyone fond of the MCU or minifigures as a whole. Considering its inclusion of a Jeep-like vehicle, motorcycle, and three exclusive figures, the $20 price point is tough to argue!</p>

"Echolord","2016-05-15T15:55:34.663Z","""Rumlow's on the Third Floor.""","<p>The Captain America: Civil War sets have been, quite possibly, my most highly anticipated wave of sets yet. We got three awesome looking sets, with some great minifigure selections. The first weekend these sets were out, I rushed to Target and picked up both this set, and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76047-1/Black-Panther-Pursuit"">76047 Black Panther Pursuit</a>. I have intentionally withheld my review on these sets until after I saw the movie, so I could give an accurate review, based on both my own opinions, and the movie. Here we go!</p>

<p>(****SPOILER ALERT****)&nbsp;This set is supposed to represent the opening scenes of Civil War, where the New Avengers (Captain America, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, and Black Widow) are attempting to apprehend Brock Rumlow (Crossbones). The mission goes south, and Crossbones escapes with a toxic chemical, in a truck, with a gun mounted on top. The truck looks nothing like the one in the set, a lot more of a military vehicle, instead of the battered truck he has in the set. (****END SPOILERS****)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a standard size for a $20 set, with some great action shots, and the Civil War logo in the corner. The graphics depict a very nice scene with the set, which, sadly does not appear in the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Crossbones: This minifigure is very good. Not accurate to the movie, but very good. His head is black, with yellow eyes, and a white &quot;skull-like&quot; paint splatter on his face. The back of his head features some dark grey lines to continue his helmet. His torso is the most accurate part of the minifig, with dark grey armor, with crossed bones painted on. The design is carried over onto the back. Both sides are very accurate to Civil War. His legs are a plain dark grey color. He includes the new breath mask&nbsp;piece, which looks ridiculous on the minifigure, but very accurate to the movie in concept, not design. The character does wear a breath mask over his helmet in the movie for a short while. This minifigure needed to have a head, with a face, and then a separate helmet piece to put on over it, to get accuracy to the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Black Widow: The minifigure is great. For Age of Ultron. This minifigure&#39;s outfit and overall appearance are direct from Age of Ultron. It&#39;s the same minifigure. The only difference is she now has her electro-shock batons, instead of the grey alien conquest guns. I appreciate the chance to get another Black Widow in a cheap set, and it will bring down her value on eBay, or bricklink. Honestly, this minifigure needed to be the one released in 2012, but with the same head as this one, if they wanted to do a really close version of the character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Falcon: This minifigure may be the best in the set. He utilizes some great printed designs, and a relatively new hairpiece. The hair was first released on Finn from the Star Wars: The Force Awakens line of sets, and looks great on this minifigure. His head has two expressions, both of which feature his goggles, which have eyes printed &quot;behind&quot; them. The head really looks like the character from Civil War. The torso might be the only real disappointment. The design is great, on both sides, but it could have been printed onto a dark grey torso, with dual molded&nbsp;arms. (Dark grey shoulders, reddish brown arm). The alien conquest guns are reused here, in black, and look decent with the character. His wings are a new mold, in medium stone grey, and look great. Dark red printing on both sides completes the look. On the back of the piece, there is a 2x2 space, with studs, upon which a circular plate with a single stud goes. This is to attach the redwing drone, which is far to big for this set. When attached to Falcon&#39;s back, Redwing is far too large, and looks out of place. Personally, I think that the 2x2 slope plate used on redwing&#39;s back, and a 1x2 plate look much better on Falcon than the official design.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is relatively simple, consisting of two bags. Bag one is the motorcycle, redwing,The roof and turret of the truck,&nbsp;&nbsp;and the &quot;Danger&quot; chemical cases. Bag two is the rest of the truck. The build makes good use of stickers to show damage to the truck, and for the motorcycle, redwing, and chemical cases.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great. The color combinations on the truck are great, and the stickers look amazing. The battered, and rebuilt design looks great, with some metal plates stuck on seemingly randomly on the front of the build. The gun turret is the only thing that looks out of place on the set, with a large, bulky appearance. The function to throw the chemical cases is nearly identical to the one on the truck in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/76047-1/Black-Panther-Pursuit"">76032&nbsp;Quinjet&nbsp;City Chase.</a>&nbsp;The motorcycle for Black Widow is nearly identical to the one in the City chase as well, with some different stickers and color combos, and might actually look better. A number of spare orange studs are included as extra ammunition for the turret.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is really cool. The minifigure selection is great, with some minor flaws. The set itself is a great build, and a really neat model. I would reccomend&nbsp;this set to any LEGO Marvel Superheroes fan.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T16:05:49.06Z","The Civil War has begun","<p><strong>Set #76050 Crossbones&rsquo; Hazard Heist: </strong>It&rsquo;s war, Civil War, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe is about to change like never before. In LEGO Marvel Super Heroes we got four sets centred around Civil War and since there weren&rsquo;t really any villains in the movie that means only heroes will appear to join Team Cap or Team Iron Man. Is this a good set? Read on and find out my thoughts on this cheapest available set from the Civil War sub-theme.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: At this point I think I&rsquo;ve covered this over and over again, but what I&rsquo;ve said before still stands true here, the box shows off the set in an action shot on the front and shows all the play features on the back of the box, is there anything more to say by this point? They&rsquo;re wonderfully designed boxes and look great on the shelf, drawing your eye and exciting younger builders to each new set.</p>

<p>Instructions: A single manual for this set which features the build broken up between two numbered bags, it&rsquo;s a fairly straight forward design that has been perfected over years so you won&rsquo;t find any difficult or tricky steps as you follow along. There will be stickers in this set though, so be mindful of that, and as usual no cardboard protection.</p>

<p>The comic focuses on the three sets from Civil War, you also get the entire Minifigure checklist in the back, not much more to say there.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Nothing stands out for me from the parts list, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s anything very impressive included in this particular set, they can&rsquo;t all be great parts packs. I do like the new bullet bike style chassis for the motorcycle piece though.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Black Widow: Natasha Romanoff looks great as a LEGO Minfiigure and at last I have one version of her, the Civil War version I believe is identical to her AoU counterpart, and her print detailing captures that look brilliantly. I love everything about it, the double-sided torso print that features blue highlights on her standard jumpsuit, the leg printing that carries on with the design and the new, much more accurate hair piece that is relatively rare.</p>

<p>For accessories she includes twin blue lightsaber blades to represent her shock sticks and the motorcycle, which while a buildable vehicle is pretty much a glorified accessory instead of a model. The bike can clip one of her sticks onto it, but the other one remains loose I&rsquo;m afraid. The design of the bike is very nice, and uses a new chassis piece which is loaded with stickers.</p>

<p>Crossbones: Dressed more in his comic look compared to his on-screen appearance, at least for the mask, this Minifigure is the only Super Villain available in the Civil War sub-theme of Marvel Super Heroes, and he looks pretty menacing. He&rsquo;s got a nice looking suit of body armor showcased on his double-sided torso with a large white X shaped like two bones on the chest, his head has a skull mask painted on and his accessories are pretty threatening, he has a flame thrower weapon, a gun which can clip to the truck because it uses the tranquilizer gun piece introduced with LEGO Dino and the new rebreather piece that fits over the neck and covers the mouth to protect him from the hazardous materials he&rsquo;s stealing.</p>

<p>Overall not a bad looking villain, a shame he didn&rsquo;t do more in the movie.</p>

<p>Falcon: Falcon looks great, he&rsquo;s got a brilliant looking double-sided torso print with loads of details for his costume, belts and straps and any number of other gadgets, his wing piece is a great looking one as well. With some nice printing detail for the feather markings. His face includes two expressions, a more normal smiling one and a more determined ready for battle one, and his hair piece is the new one designed for Finn in TFA.</p>

<p>He includes numerous accessories, there are a pair of guns, using the Space gun naturally, and a buildable Red Falcon unit that uses a decent number of pieces to make a good backpack drone for Falcon to control. Overall the stand out Minifigure from the set.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: There isn&rsquo;t much to construct here, it&rsquo;s Black Widow&rsquo;s motorcycle, Falcon&rsquo;s drone and the Hazard containers that fit in the back of Crossbone&rsquo;s truck, as well as the roof of the truck. It&rsquo;s a quick bag to build and the only difficult bits might be the sticker placement on the parts which require them, other than that not a bad build.</p>

<p>Bag 2: Crossbone&rsquo;s truck is the build of the day here and it&rsquo;s a rather familiar looking build if you also picked up the Avengers Hydra Showdown from last year. Because this is pretty much the same model design for the truck, the only changes to the build are the more open back area to accommodate the stuff Crossbone&rsquo;s is stealing, and the rear roof section. Also the detailing from the stickers and alternate colour choices for the build, if you&rsquo;ve built one version of this model it&rsquo;s safe to say you&rsquo;ve pretty much built them all.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Crossbone&rsquo;s Truck: While the build is similar the model does at least look different, several alternate parts have been swapped out to make Crossbone&rsquo;s little truck look much different from the Avenger&rsquo;s vehicle found in 2015&rsquo;s Avengers Hydra Showdown set. That being said all of the problems I had with that model are still here, the front section is much too open for my liking, and now the driver&rsquo;s compartment is even more open because there are fewer pieces inside to accommodate more Minifigures perhaps.</p>

<p>The top canopy has two stud launchers and some lights or laser blasters and the back just features two removable containers with open sides full of hazardous material (a couple of orange studs, which are extras for the launchers) and a green suitcase that seems to be important.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Not a bad set, not the greatest, but not bad. It fits the on-screen scene it is meant to emulate and does include some great Minifigures for a good value, the trouble is that the main model is a bit too repetitive if you&rsquo;ve been buying all of the Marvel Cinematic Universe sets, and the villain, while nice to get, is kind of weak if you&rsquo;ve seen the movie. Still I&rsquo;d recommend picking up this set, for a very important reason, it&rsquo;s the cheapest method of getting a Black Widow Minifigure, and Falcon looks awesome.</p>

<p>So overall, for a Civil War set it&rsquo;s not bad, not the best one out of the bunch, but certainly worthy of being picked up.</p>

"redbeardlegoman","2017-03-20T02:10:37.8Z","If ever there were a set bought just for minifigures, this is it.","<p>I bought this pack for the minifigures, and the bike. &nbsp;I&#39;m not ashamed to admit that.<br />
<br />
For the minifigures, it&#39;s a good pack - but not excellent.<br />
<br />
I have the other Falcon, so it&#39;s nice to have the Civil War variant. &nbsp;I can&#39;t say, however, that I am crazy about the Redwing drone. &nbsp;I don&#39;t exactly hate it, but I can&#39;t say I love it either. &nbsp;I think the minifigure looks far better without it attached. &nbsp;And while his legs do seem a bit bland, I could just be spoiled. &nbsp;Having said that, though, with so much detailing on the torso and wings, perhaps the legs really are too bland. &nbsp;I think, overall, if it&#39;s a price-point saver, other sacrifices could have been made.</p>

<p>Crossbones was a must have. &nbsp;He&#39;s one of those now-or-never minifigs. &nbsp;He&#39;s not likely to be produced again - unless he plays a prominent role in a future film. &nbsp;As a completist&nbsp;(an awful and expensive affliction), I would have had to get him eventually. &nbsp;I&#39;m not bothered by the less-than-faithful to the film execution. &nbsp;I think he&#39;s the strongest one in this set. &nbsp;I can&#39;t say I remember him using the flame-thrower in the film, but that doesn&#39;t bother me either.<br />
<br />
This was certainly the best way to get this version of Black Widow. &nbsp;I think she looks excellent on the swish black motorcycle and with her batons. &nbsp;Crossbones may be the best minifigure in the set, but Black Widow is a very, very close second.<br />
<br />
I love the bike, but it was also one of those rare times where I didn&#39;t put the stickers on.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m open-minded about stickers. &nbsp;Some love them, some hate them, and some of us are in the middle of the spectrum. &nbsp;In this case, however, I felt the bike looked much stronger without the badging.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, could have saved that truck. &nbsp;It&#39;s an eyesore. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t fun to build. &nbsp;It&#39;s not something I want to display with the rest of my superhero sets. &nbsp;It has a cheap, rushed disappointment that reminds me of the Castle Greyskull playset. &nbsp;At first, you&#39;re all excited to get it, then you open it up, to find a flimsy moulded shell with a few token features. &nbsp;But I loved my Castle Greyskull&nbsp;several orders of magnitude more than this rolling disaster. &nbsp;I&#39;m using it for parts now. &nbsp;Parts that I kept clean by not putting the stickers on either.<br />
<br />
I removed the bioweapon containers from it, and keep those on display, because they actually look interesting, and would make for a fun vignette.<br />
<br />
Overall, I bought it because I had to have&nbsp;Crossbones&nbsp;and Falcon, and also got a nice Black Widow on a sweet bike. &nbsp;A couple of cool bioweapon containers came with a few assorted parts, some in nougat, to use for future builds, and a sticker sheet to sell on Bricklink.</p>
