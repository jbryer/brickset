Let&#39;s dive into the review.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions: The box shows the two cars racing, with the pilots inside trying to duel each other. Instructions were really easy to follow.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts: There aren&#39;t many rare or unique parts to the set. The most striking parts to me are the pumpkin minifigure head and Green Goblin&#39;s hat.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures: The minifigures are some of the best reasons to get this set. You get Spiderman with short legs, the same old torso and a new head showing a more quirky expression. &nbsp;You also get Green goblin with short legs, a unique torso, a head showing a sneer and his unique hat piece. Spiderman also comes with a camera and Green Goblin comes with a pumpkin minifigure head.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build: The build was very easy, involving no stickers and very few technic parts. To me, the most challenging part of the build was assembling the wheels. If you are an experienced builder, this will only take a couple of minutes.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model: &nbsp;The completed model looks like a helicopter and Green Goblin&#39;s flying machine. There are a few play features. The first is you can spin the rotor on Spiderman&#39;s helicopter. You can also fire flick fire missiles at Green Goblin&#39;s craft. The wheels can move on each craft. &nbsp;Lastly, on Green Goblin&#39;s craft, you can move the wings up and down.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion: &nbsp;If you are looking for a display piece, this will work. however, I think that children will have a better time with this, having a few play features to activate. However, this is a very cheap set, so I highly recommend it to you, as it won&#39;t take too much of your wallet or allowance.&nbsp;</h3>

<p><strong>Awesomeness:</strong>&nbsp; It&#39;s lacking a little with these builds.&nbsp; Green Goblin&#39;s glider build is nothing special or new and I still think the side wings look weird facing the way they do on his glider.&nbsp; Spiderman&#39;s helicopter is the weakest of the Mighty Micro vehicles.&nbsp; It does have flick missiles (none of the others do) but it is awkward build, always tips backwards, and Spiderman doesn&#39;t even need a helicopter.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; Many people are turned off by the short legs and cartoonish features, but I think they are OK.&nbsp; Spiderman&#39;s torso print is slightly different, a little more animated, and he has this inquisitive winking face.&nbsp; He comes with a camera and a &quot;tele-zoom&quot; lens.&nbsp; Green Goblin is very cartoony and holds one of his pumpkin bombs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish they would&nbsp;at least gave him a fire piece to put on top of it.</p>

<p><strong>Well...&nbsp; </strong>I love Spiderman and was eager to add this to my collection, but there is just something disappointing about this set.&nbsp; It is definitely one of the weaker ones in the first Mighty Micro line.&nbsp; However, I do look forward to the new ones coming out.&nbsp; I think Lego learned from these and got a little more clever in their builds for the new line.</p>
