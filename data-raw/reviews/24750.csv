<p><strong>Awesomeness:</strong>&nbsp; Compared to the others this one is pretty good.&nbsp; Red Skull&#39;s tank is a smaller model of his tank from the larger Captain America vs. Hydra set, so that is pretty cool.&nbsp; It has those nice, olive green bricks and a little playability.&nbsp; Captain America&#39;s tank is where it loses some people.&nbsp; It just seems like a strange build.&nbsp; Cap sits sideways in the round piece on top and it seems rather awkward.&nbsp; Good thing his minifig kind of makes up for that.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs:&nbsp; </strong>Some people have issues with their cartoonish faces and smaller legs, but I don&#39;t.&nbsp; I think they did a great job with Captain America and gave him a rad throw-back look with white sleeves and of course he comes with his shield.&nbsp; Red Skull&#39;s anguished face and simple print on his torso look good and he comes with the tesseract (sp?).&nbsp; Unless you really dislike these mini-minifigs, I think they will make a nice addition to anyone&#39;s collection.</p>

<p><strong>Well...</strong> I didn&#39;t really care for these at first, but ended up getting the entire set for myself and one for my son.&nbsp; They look great on display and are super fun and easy to build.&nbsp; That may be my favorite part actually- that my 5 year old can easily build these without my standing over him.&nbsp; We both love them and are excited for the new wave to come out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/ Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Nothing not to be expected here. The box shows the typical racing of the cars and the instructions are simple and really easy to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigures are cute and very comic in appearance. Some people hate them, but I like them. They make a sometimes welcomed departure from their awesome movie counterparts. Yuo get Capitan America and Red Skull in this set.</p>

<p><strong>Build/ Parts</strong></p>

<p>The build is very simple as you can get it done in a matter of minutes. The parts are not bad, but I feel they are very common, maybe some are in a new color. There are three stickers, which are not bad for a set like this, but I admit, I was driven crazy to precisely put them on.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The Completed Model looks nice, with a very comical looking tank and a Hydra Jeep. Even though they look comical, I like them a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a nice set.It is very cheap, as it is only $10 in the U.S. I think the value is very good, as you get what you paid for. I recommend it in general and especially if you are on a tight budget. Hope to see you soon with another review</p>
