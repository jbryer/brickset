<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard box detailing the included figures and critters, back shows play features and other details.&nbsp; The box comes with three instruction books, the first one and most of the second are for the main build.&nbsp; The last instruction book covers the typical Minecraft Lego inspiration ideas for rebuilds.&nbsp; There are four sets of numbered bags and a couple loose large plates.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As as fairly normal for Minecraft sets, most of the blocks are very basic, although in this set you do get a quite a few of the toffee colored bricks that represent jungle wood, a color that is relatively rare.&nbsp; You also get quite a few 1x2 and 1x4 masonry pattern bricks in this less common color.&nbsp; There is a new head that is used to make the Ocelot and of course the other unique Minecraft parts (sheep head, iron axe, iron sword, diamond pickaxe, printed crafting box pieces etc, iron helmet etc). You also get a treasure chest, two printed cookies (plus the spare).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You receive Alex, with a unique &quot;Iron Armor&quot; leg print, Steve in normal print, a buildable skeleton, Ocelot (new), sheep and creeper.&nbsp; Again, they have an iron helmet, iron sword, iron axe, diamond pickaxe and bow/arrow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty straight forward, beginning quite literally from the ground up.&nbsp; I feel like the put quite a bit into this set, both in play features and scenery.&nbsp; The animal pen with opening gate was not necessary but adds alot to this set and was a great addition.&nbsp; The set is well supported with cross beams and most of the mechanics for play features are well camoflauged.&nbsp; The vine construction is well done and adds a lot of texture.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed set includes a small animal pen for the sheep, for jungle trees with tops, all with vines for both decoration and to climb on.&nbsp; There is a shoreline with a sand area and underneath the tree house is a lava pool.&nbsp; The play features/Minecraft specific mechanics are as follows:&nbsp; Where the lava pool meets the lake, there are two 2x2 flat tiles with center stud in black that can mount the two built up Obsidian blocks.&nbsp; This is meant to represent the in game mechanic where water meeting lava turns it to Obsidian.&nbsp; These can be &quot;mined&quot; with the diamond pick axe and be used elsewhere.&nbsp; The tree on the far left of the set has had its top replaced by some dirt and serves as a small farm with a couple plants just starting to pop up.&nbsp; To provide irrigation, there is a water fall pouring off from the tree top which also has a clever &quot;waterfall elevator&quot; feature built in.&nbsp; In game, you can slowly &quot;swim&quot; up&nbsp;a waterfall allowing the creation of waterfall elevators which this is meant to replicate.&nbsp; The feature has a platform build around the water fall that can be slid up and down and has a cleverly disguised latch to hold it in its up position.&nbsp; The latch and lever are disguised as a vine on the side of the tree.&nbsp; There is a classic minecraft-esque stair case leading up to the tree house from the sand patch and there is a hidden lever system for the bottom three steps that can be triggers to &quot;blow up&quot; the stair case.&nbsp; There is a patch of lava hidden under this.&nbsp; This seems to be meant as either a trap, or to represent the creeper blowing up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The top of the tree house includes two platforms, one has a crafting box and chest.&nbsp; The other has a small, open sided roofed platform with a bed inside.&nbsp; There is no door, but in front of the entrance is a 4x4 panel with some 1x1 brown square tiles on it.&nbsp; This is meant to represent a trapdoor in the game and can be triggered by the small light 2x2 vertical green element underneath it.&nbsp; This element slides back and for horizontally to release and reset the trap door.&nbsp; Triggering it with a figure on the trapdoor will drop them into the lava pool underneath.&nbsp; The mechanism is made with two long technic axles and a number of other technic stud less beams which are all completely hidden, the mechanism works decent, but does stick a bit and required some fine tuning.&nbsp; The three tallest trees all have vines&nbsp;hanging off them that can be used in game to climb up.&nbsp; In the set, they give you another way to climb to the top of their respective trees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To round things off, you have two brick built cocoa pods that can be harvested off the trees and in game are an ingredient of the included cookies.&nbsp; There is also a bucket for water, four brick built flower pots with flowers (in red and purple) two tall grass plants, two wild purple flowers on top of the main tree house room, a lookout station reached by some steps and another vine.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Lego has really stepped up the game with this set, it looks a lot more detailed then previous sets, has a wide variety of play features and design elements and provided a considerable amount of play value for my family.&nbsp; You also get a nice set of figures and animals, gear and other accessories.&nbsp; I would have liked to have seen a door for the bed room, but this is not strictly necessary, but I also would have really liked to have seen more removable &quot;blocks&quot;.&nbsp; The only two in the entire set are the two obsidian blocks.&nbsp; I think including even just a couple basic &quot;dirt with grass&quot; blocks would have helped, or some wood blocks to represent&nbsp;trees cut down by Steve and his axe&nbsp;to be turned into jungle lumber.&nbsp; Put overall I loved this set, in particular the tree top farm with water elevator, the cocoa pods/cookies and the trap door.</p>

<p>The box neatly displays a picture of the (built) set on the front, and the rebuild started on the back. The instruction manuals together- there are three- come to 250 pages. The first leaflet covers the construction of the natural ground; the second the treehouse, and the third the rebuild.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>None of the parts are new, except for an Iron axe, iron leggings and an Ocelot head. There are also standard LEGO Minecraft&trade; pieces for minifigures and the crafting table. However, a handful of Technic pieces were used for the construction of the trapdoor.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Jungle Treehouse contains six minifigures. There is Steve with an Iron Axe and Iron Helmet, a Sheep, a Creeper and a Skeleton. All four have existed before, and use the same parts as previously, with the exception of the Iron Axe. There is also Alex holding a Diamond Pickaxe and wearing iron leggings- which are new. The last included character is the Ocelot. It is 1 stud by 3 studs, compared to the sheep&#39;s 2 by 4. (Only counting the body, not heads or tails.)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me about two hours, which is okay considering how repetitive parts of it was. Whilst building it, be careful as one misplaced piece means ripping half the set apart.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is, in my eyes, almost perfect. For once, LEGO decided to put detail in less accessible parts of the sets- there is foliage and a fire underneath the house. An animal pen is prevalint, where you can store the sheep (the Ocelot doesn&#39;t fit in). Lava and water exist, with obsidian separating the two. On the water, there is a water elevator to get up to the treehouse, in case the creeper activates the exploding function on the staircase. On the tree reached by the water elevator, there are two crops- a wheat stalk and a carrot- growing. Next to it is a platform with a crafting table, chest and jungle tree on it. The other platform has a functional trapdoor activated by pulling a switch disguised as a leaf. A little shelter is also on the platform, with a bed and flower pots in it, and a watch-area on top. I like how cocoa beans and vines have been brick-built, rather than being substituted by existing parts. My only critiscm is the lack of large jungle trees, but that would probably have bumped up the &pound;75 price tag significantly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a good&nbsp;<em>playset,</em>&nbsp;designed to have characters placed all over it and battles fought on it. This set opens up a few possible future opportunities for LEGO Minecraft&trade;. Come on Lego, where&#39; s the tree pack? The cat set? This set works really well, and I would recommend it if you are just getting started on the theme, as it has a lot of &#39;main&#39; characters, or if you are a serious collector, looking for every set. Make sure you can afford it though, as it is&nbsp;&pound;75 in the UK, &euro;80 in Europe or $70 in the US.</p>
