"Andrew210505","2016-03-19T19:37:00.517Z","The Wither","<p>The Wither set is in the third batch of LEGO Minecraft minifigure-scale sets, retailing for &pound;29.99, or 35&euro;/$. It includes 317 pieces, including some really rare ones - a 16x16 Orange baseplate, and new custom Wither Skeleton heads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One criticism I&#39;ve seen quite a bit is &#39;Oh, don&#39;t fight the Wither in the Nether&#39;. Personally, I think that was done so a cheaper Nether-based set could be made, and so that the Wither Skeletons could be implemented. The only other criticisms I can see are there only being two Wither Skeletons, and no 2x6 plate so Steve can actually build a Wither.</p>

<p>Speaking of Steve, the minifigures included are: Steve with an Iron Chestplate and Helmet, and a bow, two Wither Skeletons with Stone Swords&nbsp;and a Wither.</p>

<p>Building it was quite fun, taking roughly forty minutes. The only difficulty I had was slight confusion with the technic pieces.</p>

<p>Playing with it is nice, killing Wither Skeletons before shooting at the fortress with TNT.</p>

<p>All in all, I think this a good set - if you want, you could just order a bunch of black pieces and build an obsidian cage for the Wither - and that this would go brilliantly alongside 21122 The Nether Fortress.</p>

<p>BOX/INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</p>

<p>the box art is great and accurate and the instructions are easy to read a little harder compared to the cave or older sets but still easy compared to large sets.</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>this set is chalk full of sand red pieces and orange bricks and slopes, perfect set for the nether just by itself&nbsp;and light gray but the bricks can get confusing to translate the gray brick from stone and gravel.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES</p>

<p>the minifigures are perfect for this set</p>

<p>Steve- this Steve comes with iron armor and a bow great way to get armor in a cheap set.</p>

<p>Witherskelitons&nbsp;- the set comes with two so thats great way to stock up on swords</p>

<p>Wither- my first boss mob and is great with 2 bending joints and the middle head rises up and down</p>

<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p>it was easy to build and came with alot of great pieces and was fun to build!</p>

<p>THE STRUCTURE</p>

<p>the set is a small chunk&nbsp;of a nether fortress and a tnt cannon that fires tnt to about 12-14 inches and has mineable&nbsp;area and a cheap way to get fire and&nbsp;is just great overall on the side of the build you can pull a block out and activates a tower fall feature when you shoot tnt at it and will fall but due to the rubber on the bottom it is safe to fall as hard it hits</p>

<p>PUT WITH WHAT</p>

<p>if you own the nether fortress of the nether rail way it goes in it perfect with both but there is less room with the nether railway</p>

<p>MY OPINION</p>

<p>this set is great overall and has neat action feature and is great for a cheep nether booster!</p>

<p>CHEEP WAYS TO BUY!</p>

<p>amazon has sales can get from 21.99$ to 29.99$ today which is the 1st of June&nbsp;it is about 27.87$ where it is now rare to find at Walmart since the 2017 spring sets has invaded and at other major retail stores.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>this set is great for all ages and is 318pz of greatness</p>
