"LegoManiac98","2016-01-01T23:33:03.493Z","Nexo Knights Battle Blaster","<h3>With the new year comes all of the brand new LEGO sets soon to be displayed on store shelves. I recently purchased this set, and Chaos Catapult to be my introduction to the new Nexo Knight series.</h3>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and instructions are fairly small as this is only a $10 USD set, the box shows the few play features including the new disc shooting feature.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One big reason I am looking forward to the Nexo&nbsp;Knight series is because of how much it reminds me of the 2002 Ice Planet theme with the similar neon orange and blue color scheme. The orange and steel grey chest included in the set is the first of its kind in that color scheme and is a welcome addition. The mechanisms that shoot the discs on the vehicle I believe to be new as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The two minifigures included in this set are quite detailed for a small LEGO set. The monster soldier&#39;s printing is quite detailed and shiny to give the appearance of metal plating. His actual armor is quite impressive with an interesting shoulder piece likely to signify rank, or just for protection. His helmet is nice too and helps give him a more threatening image when the horns are attached to it. The monster soldier&#39;s head has two sides one being a calm focused face with the other more angry as his teeth are bared.&nbsp;Our hero in this set is a generic Nexo soldier, but with very detailed printing on the front and back of his torso supporting what looks like the crest of the king. His armor is very large and bulky to give him a tougher stature. I love the new blue helmet that he is wearing as it was mainly used only in grey for previous castle series. His face has 2 sides one being and the other being slightly confused, although unfortunately they both look very similar.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite simple only adding 1 to 3 new pieces per step&nbsp;and is likely meant for a younger audience to construct it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once finished the model is quite nice, the disc shooters fire quite far up to about 6 feet or so. The scorpion type vehicle that the Nexo Knight rides has a unique firing system and has some play value and gets the job done for the price it is sold for.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a nice introduction to the Nexo&nbsp;Knight series and I would recommend it if you are considering only buying one small set to start with as it has interesting play features and includes soldiers from both armies to play with.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>the box has a nice logo on it with the sheild and jestro&nbsp;at the bottom left corner. it shows the knight at the top part of the box and displays both minifigs where jestro is. the instructions quite easy to read and follow but they came folded and it was hard for it to stay down.</p>

<h3>Parts&nbsp;</h3>

<p>the color selection of the parts remind for the theme remind me of the ice planet them. there are some nice pasrts in the set like the printed disc&nbsp;for the launcher it comes with five of those all printed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures&nbsp;</h3>

<p>the minifigs&nbsp;are very nice the new head piece for the kinght&nbsp;is not bad it goes while with his hat. the evil minifigs (forgot his name) has back printing and &nbsp; the helment is nice too</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>the build took 15 minutes for me but the finished molded is pretty well made for a ten dollar set this is a easy build and no stickers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>the model is as big enough to display on a small shelf and has very good quality. i would give the set 5/5 for that</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>if you are looking to start this theme get the two ten dollar sets firsts. i like this new theme and i look forward to the other sets.</p>

Science Fiction meets High Fantasy settings with these interesting little builds, and the first is used to defend The Fortrex from the Lava Monsters.</span></span></span></span></p>

Some of them are quite intriguing, there&rsquo;s some new axe-head pieces in translucent orange, a silvery grey treasure chest with a translucent orange top, a small translucent orange cockpit style piece of Classic Space fame and some disc launchers that MOC fans might find a use for. Overall a pretty fun selection of parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

He includes some decent printing, with a lot of detail for his armour and a dual-sided face for alternate expressions. He uses a brand new helmet piece and a sharp looking armour shoulder piece, both in black, and to attack he has the new stud-shooting crossbow accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>

It can be driven by the Royal Soldier using handlebars to steer, pushing on the back two sections causes them to slide forward so you can launch the discs at the enemy. There are five discs in the set, two can rest in the launchers and three more are stored in the treasure chest, these have nice cross-shaped designs printed on them looking like some kind of energy powered discus projectiles.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a decent Battle Pack and has a few useful parts for people looking to add to a Classic Space design and wanting some new translucent orange parts. The Minifigures are nice, though two seems a bit lacking for a decent sized battle pack&hellip; However combining this with the Chaos Catapult as a pair of cheap Nexo Knights sets can truly add to a good battle scene. The only complaint leveled against it I could make is that neither set offers physical NEXO Powers, the only sets not to include them, which is somewhat unfortunate as it would give something for the Minifigures to fight over.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Ernst","2016-04-20T18:24:54.853Z","Knighton Battle Blaster ; in between Castle and Chima ??","<p><strong>Overall 3 bricks :</strong> An attempt to review a set from a theme I don&#39;t like but I&#39;ll try to review it objectively. From the moment I saw the first pictures of the Nexo Knight theme I was sure this was not my theme, in fact I&#39;m happy it didn&#39;t turn out to be a Castle subtheme. Different from me (being a&nbsp;historic themes&nbsp;addict) my 10 year old son (the Nexo Knight target group) liked this set so the first <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Nexo-Knights"">NK</a> set entered our Lego playground. A starter set with good&nbsp;playing possibilities for kids, no collectors item and from my perspective a collection of bricks with some useful parts, 1 nice mini figure and one with potential after some adjustments.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks : </strong>Building is not the most difficult mission and Lego has managed to invent a kind of Catapult that doesn&#39;t look like one but shoots like one. The result when finished&nbsp;is a solid (motorized ??) cart with good shooting abilities.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks :</strong> Looking at the parts separately it is not that bad and some useful like the dark blue ones and some new ones like the <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=22388&amp;idColor=95#T=P&amp;C=95"">square&nbsp;slopes</a>. The mini figures : I like the evil one, <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?M=nex005#T=P"">the Ash Attacker</a> is an awesome figure you add to Castle MOC&#39;s. The good guy needs some adjustments, I would switch his head and give him a yellow one and remove the breastplate. The helmet is a point of doubt, the blue one could do in a parade but no good in battle.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks :</strong> My kid had a lot of fun playing with it and enjoyed the shooting possibilities so I guess 4 bricks are deserved.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks :</strong> Looking at it objectively &euro;10,00 is not a bad price for a set with 2 mini figures and good playing possibilities so I reward it with 3 bricks. Surely for kids this is a welcome addition for an adventurous time, not really a must have set&nbsp;for an AFOL in my opinion.</p>

"FowlerBricks","2018-01-30T22:18:22.45Z","The Knighton Battle Blaster or Ash Attacker Gets Pulped.","<p>This is the second Nexo Knights set that I have gotten (the first being Ultimate Clay). It retailed at $9.99, but since it&#39;s now retired, the price may vary. It incudes two minifigures and has 76 pieces.</p>

<p><br />
THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS<br />
The box shows an Ash Attacker foolishly charging at the Battle Blaster with no reinforcements to be seen. The back shows that he changes his mind a bit late and begins to run away with the Royal Guard hot on his tail. (Note: I no longer had the box at the time of this review&#39;s writing, so I apologize for the lack of pictures of it).&nbsp;There&#39;s also a little panel that shows how the disk shooting function works.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/emwt8ytsj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>In the instructions, there&#39;s a minifigure checklist and a scannable Nexo Power. I don&#39;t know the name of this one, but I assume it&#39;s something like &#39;Crocodile Tears&#39;. Overall, everything looks great! (feel free to scan the power)</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/b3avj5jcz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
THE PARTS<br />
A nice selection of trans-bright orange and dark blue, plus some wheels, a silver chest, two light bley disk shooters and five printed disks.</p>

<p><br />
THE MINIFIGURES<br />
So we&#39;ve got the aforementioned Ash Attacker and Royal Guard. The Ash Attacker has superb torso and leg print that displays jagged silver and red armor that is vaguely similar to the Moria Orc&#39;s armor.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/o66i2gc5v/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;The printing continues around the back of the torso.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/eye9lrctf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>His head has equally good printing with two expressions. The first is a kinda upset frown. The second is an angry/yelling face. He includes a clawlike piece of shoulder armor that fits him nicely.On top of the shoulder spikes, he has a spiky helmet to match, completing his scary look.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/oixw8n9v7/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>His weapon is a stud-shooting crossbow.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/h2ymmtrar/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I wish the set had included a secondary weapon, even a small one, so that he could do some close combat. It&#39;s a bit tough to do close combat with a crossbow. If you have a dark silver broadsword, that fits nicely.That way he can do battle at any range. Overall, a stellar minifig and worth amassing an army of them. Next and last, we have the Royal Guard. He sports a helmet with a brim, which has appeared in many other castle, but it&#39;s in blue this time. (so much blue!)</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/u746zibmr/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The Guard also has a medium azure chestplate. His head is pearlized silver. if you are wondering why his face is orange, it&#39;s because he&#39;s a robot and his face is a screen.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/v9edi1mqb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>He has two faces: a slightly confused face and a stern face.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/z71n6wbyb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/x17ccyt8j/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Both faces look very very similar and I think an angry face would have suited better. His torso and leg printing is marvelous. The torso displays the King&#39;s crest and multi colored armor with superb detail. His arms are pearlized silver just like his head and his head is the same azure color as his armor. The legs have more multi colored armor as well. His weapon is the slightly updated broadsword. Unfortunately, one of my cats chewed the tip off mine so he is pictured with the older version. I really like this figure and I&#39;d love to make an army of these guys.</p>

<p><br />
THE BUILD<br />
The build is a ballista-esque vehicle armed with laser cannons, disk shooters and axes that just so happen to be perfectly head level (minifig head level, that is).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/dkmmqcayb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/aqjhcxbcz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The triggers for the disk shooters are cleverly integrated into the Battle Blaster and you access them from the back.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/7wgbzh1gz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The whole thing is really simple but super effective. The Royal Guard sits comfortably behind a trans-neon orange windscreen.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jybptmxur/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>He holds onto a set of handlebars to steer. The one problem that I have with this build is that there isn&#39;t a spot the hold the guard&#39;s sword. He just has to awkwardly hold it off to the side.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/qc0swv05v/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Other than that, I think this is an excellent vehicle. There&#39;s a silver treasure chest with a trans-neon orange lid that holds the extra blaster disks.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5rvyy0hqb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4plsft6qb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Before I got this set, I had heard some people saying that it reminded them of the Classic Space sets and I agree. It very much does look and feel like a Classic Space set, which is a good thing, at least in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>
