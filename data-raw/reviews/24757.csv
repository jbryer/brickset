"joemmo","2016-03-22T21:23:33.387Z","You'll be hunting under the sofa...","<p>My boy had a Christmas voucher for Smyths burning a hole in his pocket so off we went with plans to get a small Star Wars set but once he saw this on the shelf the Rebel Alliance went on the back burner.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Not the normal small box shape, this is a bit more square with plenty of room to show a fight starting between our Nexo Soldier (?) and the Bad Red Guy in his tooth-emblazoned catapult-car.</p>

<p>Instructions are unremarkable but they do the job. The back of the booklet has several pages showing other sets from the line and invitations to download the Nexo&nbsp;app, which we have not yet done.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some unusual pieces including 2 &#39;rocky&#39; wedges and half a boulder in trans orange, several Mixel type tooth pieces and a surprising amount of technics parts - including some flexible rubber joints that I haven&#39;t encountered before. More on those later. There are some rather pointy gold 1x1 pyramid studs - again a new piece to me at least and some thin circular pieces used for the wheels.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 figs - one blue Nexo&nbsp;trooper (I don&#39;t think he&#39;s technically a Knight) and an evil looking Red chap. Nexo&nbsp;guy has a nice shoulder piece with 4 studs on the back so you can attach all sorts of parts, plus he comes with a sword. Printing is nice on body and legs and he has 2 faces, although they are pretty similar. His helmet is a bit of a loose fit though.</p>

<p>Bad Red Guy also has a shoulder piece in black, a helmet and the new crossbow style shooter - which is very effective. So much so that we&#39;ve already lost 2 of the 3 studs supplied. Printing is also good top to bottom and his evil grin is quite amusing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>More intricate than expected. The main frame use technic beams and pins for the chassis and the catapult with more regular bricks layered on top to create the humourous&nbsp;monster face styling. The firing mechanism itself uses some flexible connectors to hold an axle and connector to the half-rock and&nbsp;stores the energy when you pull it back then you&nbsp;just release to fire. Simple but effective, the 2x2 trans orange &#39;lava&#39; bricks supplied will easily fly 2-3m&nbsp;under the nearest piece of furniture.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s not the prettiest or most interesting thing in the world but it has good play value, a few unusual&nbsp;parts and a couple of minifigs&nbsp;ready to battle. There&#39;s plenty here in &nbsp;one set to keep a child entertained or to add to a bigger set later. Only real criticism is that it&#39;s a bit awkward to sit the bad guy in the seat of his catapult since his seat rocks back and forth, not a big deal but fiddly for smaller, less dextrous fingers.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Initially the Nexo range wasn&#39;t that appealing to me personally but these sets are fun, they have a wacky, bright aesthetic that will appeal to the target audience and my son likes them. Already its become involved in a kind of pirate / knight / monster mash up and isn&#39;t that the point of Lego? Decent value compared to a licenced set too, I don&#39;t think this will be the last Nexo set we buy.</p>

"Ernst","2016-04-25T22:10:43.613Z","Chaos Catapult; actually a good set !","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks : </strong>My son&nbsp;celebrated his 10th birthday so another Nexo Knight set entered our collection. And although I still don&#39;t like most of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Nexo-Knights"">NK</a> sets I must admit this one&nbsp;is not half bad, despite the trans orange color maybe even good. The catapult looks good and shoots very well, just replace the 3 prominent trans orange parts and you have a sort of realistic catapult. The evil Crust Smasher is ok again but I still dislike the silly Royal Knight. Overall these small sets grow on you I must admit, still no AFOL stuff but not as bad as I expected.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks :</strong> Building is not too difficult of course considering the target group. You built from the chassis with the familiar technic beams to finish with the orange parts which give it a Nexo Knight look. An interesting part is the technic used for the shooting mechanism with the flexible rubber connectors, result is a great shooting catapult.</p>

<p><strong>Parts&nbsp;4 bricks :</strong> The new <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=64867&amp;idColor=98#T=P&amp;C=98"">trans-orange wedges</a> could be useful, same as the white teeth parts. Beside that a nice collection of good useful parts. The 2 mini figures are a matter of taste. I like the bad guy again : <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?M=nex012#T=P"">the Crust Smasher</a> and still no positive feelings for the the Royal Knight.&nbsp;He reminds&nbsp;me to the silly <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/category-Castle/subcategory-Knights-Kingdom-II"">Knights Kingdom II</a> good guys which is not a compliment.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks :</strong> Looking at it objectively the set has great playing ability for the target group. The 2 opposite factions with a real shooting kind of crossbow for the bad guy and a great shooting catapult that even looks nice or fierce. So I think it deserves the 5 bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : Again the objective look&nbsp;encourages me to give again 5 bricks. The &euro; 10,00 is a decent price for a 93 parts set with 2 mini figures that offers great playability and a lot of useful parts. I don&#39;t expect a high collectors value for the future.</p>

"Hashem1983","2016-10-06T22:05:20.18Z","Quite Effective for a small build","<p>I saw this in Toys R&nbsp;Us while I was aiming for the &quot;70310 -&nbsp;Knighton Battle Blaster&quot; and then I saw this set, I liked the parts in the 70310 especially the treasure chest and the bad guy mini fig, but since I picked up the &quot;70331 - Ultimate Macy&quot; And it has the same treasure chest I decided to put back the 70310 and pick up the 70311 and for a small starter or cheap set, this catapult is quite effective.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It comes in a small square&nbsp;box showing the crust smasher driving the catapult and the Royal Guard&nbsp;attacking him with his sword.&nbsp;On the back it shows the features including scanning the Nexo&nbsp;Knights shields which there are not in this set.</p>

<p>The Instructions was a mini folded booklet, it was easy to follow but was fun to build, still as I keep on saying it, Lego must make their instructions a bit more challenging, but it was above ok in this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A mixture between familiar and new parts like the 4X4 trans-Orange rocky part and the 1x1 pyramid in Gold and you get an extra part of these new pieces, the black rubbery damper to be able to throw parts, some technic pieces, some of them are new to me, dark brown slope pieces, few horns and white teeth.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Comes with two minifigures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Crust Smasher: The bad guy in this set and he&#39;s all red. The head though it has only one face but there is a print on the back of his head of a texture feel even though it will be hidden with his black helmet, but still a nice touch if the helmet got lost, the front face however has an angry expression with yellow eyes and an open mouth that shows his white teeth. The torso is double printed as well, as for the legs print&nbsp;only on the front and has some nice printing on the feet that represents claws, which&nbsp;is a nice touch. This figure&nbsp;beside his black helmet also wears a shoulder Armour and holds the new crossbow that actually shoots flat studs, &nbsp;and its quite effective.</li>
	<li>Royal Guard: Despite that he could be the most boring figure and his double sided face has the same unhappy expressions, he&#39;s ok, the torso is double printed and has an Armour&nbsp;in blue and grey, it also has the logo on the front of the Knighton kingdom, and though the blue Armour that comes with it hides the back prints, still its a nice addition to the set, the legs are &nbsp;printed as well including the feet. he wears a blue helmet and holds a very nice long sword. I only wish one of his face expressions shows some joy or happiness. When I put this figure next to my 6085 figure, this Royal Guard have some ATTITUDE from the first day, while my old figure still happy to be on service.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For a small build its a fun impressive build, I did enjoy it, its rarely when you buy a small or starter set that requires some attention to the instructions, especially in the part where you are building the mechanism of the catapult.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a small set its wonderful, although the Crust Smasher has no controls to drive this set, still its acceptable, I did like the front part that represents an open mouth of a monster, you could even move the top part up and down to give you easy access to the minifigure, the sitting place is fine and sturdy once you place the figure down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the catapult, though its my first Lego catapult, this is one of the BEST catapults Lego ever created using simple pieces and mechanism as it shoots far away,but just be careful. The wheels are Ok and in fact I liked how that Lego did not just use the black wheels only but also added the 2x2 round pieces that are in dark brown to cover the technic pieces from the sides.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I loved it very much, and as I said, for a small set it has nice building techniques and a great simple mechanism, there are lots of fun and playability in this set, agree or disagree with me, but I feel this set could be mixed with the traditional medieval&nbsp;Castle lines.</p>

<p>Though I despised the theme from the start when I saw the Low res images of them, but when things got more clearer I found it a wonderful and an impressive theme line from Lego.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t hesitate buying this set for your kids, its and awesome and a fun set. Enjoy!!!</p>

"Japanbuilder","2016-05-25T10:50:25.443Z","NEXO I think I believe now!","<p>This is my first NEXO Knights Set. I admittedly had very very low expectations for the line. Initially the colors for this line and the theme in general was a bit too out of left field for me. But looking at them on the store shelf along with its counter part set (70310) I decided to take the plunge and get both. This one by far stood out the most when I was done building it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>For such a small set with such small box, the instructions felt a bit on the thick side. I was surprised.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of new parts are in this set, at least for me. Not being a Mixels fan or anything these are my first teeth and horn pieces in these colors. The translucent bricks are also interesting. As it came together the thing actually seemed to come to life for me. Chalk it all up to the way the parts were used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>2 Figures were included in this set a Royal Knight/Guard and an Ash Warrior/Bowman, not sure on the correct terms yet.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build came together quickly but it grew into its own very colorful set with lots of fun play features! The pieces of rubber that comprise the catapult&#39;s mechanism at first felt real weak to me but after launching one of the translucent pieces clear across the room with it I became a believer in the line. The Ash bowman also has a fun new stud launching gun which works very well and adds to the look of the line in general.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This line screams PLAY WITH ME! I mean it really does. It is not for display so if you are hoping for traditional castle this line is probably not for you. But as toy with some interesting figures and story to give background to the whole line it is really great. The only downside to this and set 70310 also suffers is the wheels are hard plastic so it is hard to get good traction from them on hardwood flooring or tables. But that is a small gripe. To kids the stuff just works and they&#39;re fun. I totally see the appeal now.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>After doubting the viability of this line,&nbsp;this set and its small counter part brought me into the fold of NEXO. These are bright, fun, excellent toys. Make sure you don&#39;t keep em on the shelf, these are mean to be tossed, shot, disassembled and reassembled into anything the figures need for you and yours to&nbsp;have fun. Enjoy!</p>

"The_creative_box","2016-08-13T11:26:40.27Z","Chaos catapult - just WOW","<p>I bought this set a while ago, and I&acute;ll try to make this review not that similar to the ones written before. Read on to find out what I thought!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box measures 14x12 cm, and shows the chaos catapult in action. The instructions are easy to follow, as expected to be in a small set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is a great parts pack! It includes 4 curved 1x2 dark brown slopes, 3 of the new 1x1 gold pyramids (one of them is a spare), trans-clear orange elements and not to forget the royal knights sword and the crust smashers armor.&nbsp;This is also the cheapest way to get the new, dangerous&nbsp;stud-shooting crossbow element.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The <strong>Royal knight </strong>is the protagonist of the set. He has armor printing all around his body,&nbsp; which is mainly cast in dark azure and pearl silver. I&#39;m not a big fan of Nexo Knights overall, mostly because of the <em>Nexo</em>. The combination of SF and some magic/medieval stuff doesn&#39;t really get to me, and that&#39;s why I dislike the knight - seeing from my point of view he stands out in this set like a silly toy soldier, although the standard and printing of the fig is very good. I give him 3/5 stars because he comes with a nice sword,&nbsp;but I think the figure&nbsp;pulls down the &quot;value for money&quot; a bit.</p>

<p>The <strong>Crust smasher, </strong>the royal knight&#39;s opponent, is an adorable figure (ok, he doesn&acute;t look really handsome, but he&#39;s very, very cool). He has some cool printing on his red chest, and his legs/trousers is even better with some claws marked on the feet. The head has an angry expression with white, bared teeth, which makes the crust smasher looking like a sibling to an Uruk-hai. He comes with a cool 2-piece shooting crossbow which&nbsp;might be the&nbsp;worst - and smallest weapon Lego has ever created. When pulling&nbsp;the &quot;trigger&quot;, the flat stud flies like a cannonball through the air, and it has got a range&nbsp;of at least 5 meters (I&nbsp;don&acute;t dare using it again). Overall i give&nbsp;the figure&nbsp;6/5 stars.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very enjoyable for a set with less than 100 pieces. Building the mechanism was a lot more challenging than I first thought, as my expectations were quite low (:</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The catapult looks as good as it does on the box, and is a lot sturdier than I first thought. The main function (shooting lava bolls) works better than expected, the lava ball flies at leas half a meter before hitting the ground.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As I&acute;ve said before, I&acute;m not a NK fan, but this set ROCKS! It comes with a good, sturdy catapult, a bad guy who can fight the silly good guy and a lot of good pieces! What more can you take from a 10 buck set? Just buy it if you can, you won&acute;t be disappointed either you&acute;re a NK fan or not!&nbsp;</p>
