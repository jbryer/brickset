<p>The instructions come in two booklets, which is rather strange for a $19.99 USD set. Otherwise, everything is relatively normal with several bags and a small sticker sheet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with a wonderful selection of parts including 612703, 6122170, and lots of nice trans orange pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Lance is amazing, coming with an epic helmet and armor. His little robot is also nice, coming with a cool printed tile for the chest (there is an extra too). The monster comes with a relatively rare hair piece, and has what appears to be some sort of a 10 pack?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fun, but a bit repetitive, due to the horses relatively symmetrical shape.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is ok to look at, but it completely makes up for its looks with its amazing and quick transformation feature, which turns it into a motorcycle. I recommend that you watch a video review to see this. It rolls very well in car form, but does lack some movement when in horse form. Only the front legs have independent articulation, the back ones have to move together as one. However, this does not prevent the horse from entering both a walking and upright pose.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set, and definitely worth your money, especially if you want the Lance figure.</p>

His faithful bot ready to attend and&nbsp;augment his battle prowess and save Knighton from the evil forces of Jestro! Can this horse measure up to Lance&#39;s exacting demands? Read on.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box depicts Lance dominating the sad Flame Thrower. It is actually a pretty inviting cover. You also get 2 manuals and a sticker sheet with 7 stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A ton of technic bars and pins are to be found in this set. But we get the darkish blue and medium blue we have come to expect from Knighton technology as well as trans-orange all over the place. We also get one Nexo&nbsp;power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By the time you finish you will have a fair share of technic bits and an extra Lance Bot tile piece which is always appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As is custom for this line the figures are great! Fantastic printing is to be found on all of them even the head of the bot which is dual sided gets love. If this is your first Lance you will like his print and his accessories to be sure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build honestly took me longer than I thought it would. About an hour and a half. Mostly I was slowed up by how much technic is involved. Almost the entire build has pins and connectors and rods going into it. For the youngest builders in the age range this may be actually quite annoying to make. As it came together it became fun to see the horse take shape but it took me a while. Also&nbsp;the presence of so much technic means a lot fo exposed holes and awkward looking bits.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model towers over figures. I am not sure that Flame Thrower knows what he has gotten himself into. He can easily be trodden by the horse or impaled by the lance. The transformative feature looks like the more stable battle platform though. Either pose serious danger to the Lava Monster.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall the set is not as exciting as it looks in the cover art. The posing for the horse is very limited. In fact, the rear legs must move together due to the way the technic pieces had to be connected. The motorcycle variant is by far the better looking of the two and looks more stable for combat and faster to get around in. It also compares favorably with Macy&#39;s Thunder Mace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[url=https://flic.kr/p/LP74YY][img]https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8192/29412757172_11cd0055c0.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/LP74YY]P9071994[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/139708441@N07/]Macster Tome[/url], on Flickr</p>

<p>Also in my opinion this version of Lance while good is not as good as the one included in Merlok&#39;s Library 2.0. That lance has a jet pack and far easier to use lance. The one in this set is LONG and makes balancing Lance quite a task even with his shield as support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further diminishing this set is the fact that when transformed into the motorcycle it is hard to take and move around. The assembly for the front legs and wheel and head are all together so picking the bike up from the center (where the head usually will rest) means you end up partly moving the head up and the front wheel in a bit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would wait for this to go on sale before committing to a purchase. The figures are great but younger builders may be turned off by the abundance of technic pieces which also give the horse an unfinished look.&nbsp;</p>

While many may find it fun and exciting there is a massive divide due to the very nature of the Space Knights theme that has combined two of LEGO&rsquo;s classic system IPs into a single Big Bang Theme.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Initially I was hesitant to buy anything out of this Theme, traditional elements are a huge influence for AFOLs. I was pleasantly surprised though when I managed to pick up a few small sets and then I began collecting in earnest.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set is from the initial release and it is something that I had on my short list of sets to get as soon as possible.

And for once I&rsquo;m going to be extremely honest, after careful deliberation I find myself admitting that the box designs for this Theme are a tad on the weaker side. The image work to showcase the sets is handled in the same typical LEGO box design fashion, which is as always quite stellar.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">However I find the colour choices to be rather lacking. LEGO did not go bold enough in my opinion with the box design. It&rsquo;s a bland and boring generic colour with dark blue and yellow/orange for colours. In my opinion I feel the box design could have used a bit more flare, something to reflect the digital aspect of the Nexo Powers, perhaps some kind of tech detailing in the background of the design around the logo to make it pop. As is the box designs for this theme, while perfectly capable of standing out on a shelf, fail to truly capture the fun aspects of the Theme as well as Ninjago or Chima have done in the past.</span></span></span></span></p>

I often scratch my head at this design choice, it&rsquo;s hardly useful because you have a greater chance of losing one of the manuals and needing to go online to find the build instructions when you want to rebuild the set after disassembling it for storage or something.</span></span></span></span></p>

Stand outs for me are the two large blue bits that look like the sides of a mecha and the unprinted silver nexo shield piece. There aren&rsquo;t as many rare or unique parts in this set compared to larger ones from the Theme.

Instead he&rsquo;s got a quiver and crossbow as seen in Classic Castle sets. He&rsquo;s got a decent enough print, the double-sided torso is similar to the Crust Smasher as is the head, while the legs are more in-keeping with the Ash Attacker being armoured and more detailed. He&rsquo;s also using the Mohawk CMF hair piece in black, overall a mismatch of parts to make another generic enemy for Lance to fight.</span></span></span></span></p>

He even includes a very short spear to do battle with and a dual-sided face for alternative build options.</span></span></span></span></p>

Then you begin building the rear portion of Lance&rsquo;s horse. Due to the nature of the model you&rsquo;ll find a lot of Technic axles and pins being used during construction, the large bits found in Maula&rsquo;s Ice Mammoth Stomper for the legs are used to give the Mecha Horse its legs.</span></span></span></span></p>

Getting the wheels to fit and the parts to slide smoothly proved slightly difficult. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s just a tolerance issue or what, but when sliding things onto multiple axles and pins at once I always seem to have a little bit of trouble getting everything to line up properly and slide together smoothly.</span></span></span></span></p>
