A favorite.","<p>Upon seeing the box, Clay&#39;s Rumble Blade immediately struck&nbsp;me as being the next evolution of Equila&#39;s Ultra Striker from the Chima&nbsp;theme. They are both short, wide tanks&nbsp;with detachable flying vehicles in the middle. Clay&#39;s Rumble Blade, though, trades in&nbsp;the treads&nbsp;for two detachable land vehicles.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box does a good job showing off the set, and I like that it&#39;s one of the thick square boxes rather than the longer rectangular ones. These types of boxes seem to bend less easily. The instructions are perfectly clear, although you only get one booklet. This is&nbsp;a set where you could potentially have three people working on it at the same time, but you&#39;d probably need&nbsp;to find a scan of the instructions online.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The wheels&nbsp;and&nbsp;angular pieces stand out to me. The vehicle rolls on 7&nbsp;wheels, but there are a total of 10 wheel pieces because the back of Clay&#39;s detachable vehicle uses 3 wheels to represent a rocket. I like the wings and the blade piece that you see along the top of the vehicle. There isn&#39;t as much technic as you&#39;d probably expect; the detachable vehicles are attached with&nbsp;classic&nbsp;claw pieces. Always of note in Nexo Knights sets is all the of the translucent orange.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good selection of parts. I feel like I&#39;m repeating myself&nbsp;sometimes when I review these sets, but the Lego Group seems to be doing an awesome job putting parts in these sets that you would have issues obtaining any other place.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A set of this size typically has three minifigures. This set gives you five, but the catch is that two of them are &quot;bots&quot;, which are identical to each other, (choice of two faces on each)&nbsp;and they&#39;re made of a bunch of parts rather than the typical Lego person mold. Really there are only two standard Lego minifigures: Clay and Ash Attacker. The fifth is a scurrier, which is a little monster that I think is unique to Nexo Knights. All of these figures are very typical of&nbsp;Nexo Knights, and if you have more sets in this theme, you&nbsp;already own figures that look almost identical.&nbsp;However, no matter how I look at it, I can&#39;t see it as anything but generous that you get 5 figures in a set with 367 pieces. It&#39;s not like it would make sense to have three Nexo&nbsp;Knights in the set, so bots fit the concept well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You get three bags.&nbsp;After bag 1 you have the entire flying vehicle to play with. After bag 2, you also have both of the side vehicles. Bag 3 is the center that all three attach to. I liked this build order because you have something fully complete to play with after each bag.</p>

<p>The low point is repeating the same build&nbsp;4 times on bag 2, but you can do all 4 at the same time if you pay attention when you get to that bag. That makes it feel much less tedious.</p>

<p>I enjoyed bag 3 the most&nbsp;because that was where you got to see how all the vehicles were going to come together, and it wasn&#39;t done how I anticipated either.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve seen it in photos a bunch of&nbsp;times, but somehow having it in my hands make me like it a lot more. My immediate reaction is that this is one of the best Nexo Knights sets. Possibly second only to The Fortrex.</p>

<p>For the piece count, it&#39;s not going to impress you with its size, but the amount of details makes up for that easily. When it&#39;s all together, you&#39;re seeing very little technic or even Lego studs. Everything has some kind of interesting piece, smooth piece, or wheel covering it.</p>

<p>The mechanism to detach the side vehicles is so easy to use, and it was brilliant how they used tooth pieces as a stopper for a sliding component. You will see what I mean if you build it! When you push a piece in the back of the vehicle, the side vehicles pop off and away. There&#39;s no tugging,&nbsp;and they don&#39;t just gently wiggle away. It&#39;s dramatic, and I like that. Clay&#39;s vehicle does have to be manually pulled off, but this is not at all hard to do with the rocket on the back that you can just pull up on.</p>

<p>The side cannons can aim in any direction, too! Literally any direction! If you want to fire them behind the vehicle, above, or even&nbsp;down into a cliff behind the vehicle, yes, you can easily&nbsp;do any of&nbsp;that.&nbsp;I didn&#39;t like the bare studs on top of these cannons, but I had enough extra pieces to decorate them nicely.</p>

<p>As I mentioned in the parts section, this bad boy is rolling on seven wheels. This is because the center of the vehicle remains its own viable vehicle even when it&#39;s by itself. It uses three wheels, and the bots each get two. Basically, you are not going to flip Clay&#39;s Rumble Blade when it&#39;s fully together. If you accidentally kick it after someone&nbsp;leaves&nbsp;it sitting somewhere, it&#39;s almost guaranteed to land flat on the ground, right side up. I believe this would&nbsp;take&nbsp;the award for vehicle least likely to flip in Lego history.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I started this review comparing the set to Equila&#39;s Ultra Striker, and I wasn&#39;t wrong about that comparison. These vehicles are pretty similar. While I do&nbsp;love the Ultra Striker, and it is a larger vehicle,&nbsp;I have to give the nod to Clay&#39;s Rumble Blade. This is definitely&nbsp;the superior tank build, and whomever is designing these things has a tall order to improve on this. Four vehicles in one for a set this size, in a tank this sturdy and unflippable, with two 360 rotating projectile launchers? And it all looks awesome? If you have even a passing interest in Nexo Knights, consider buying this.</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-29T08:47:50.017Z","One of those near perfect feature dense vehicle sets at a good price point","<p>I picked this one up, just because I liked the look. It reminded me a bit of the old beloved Ice Planet stuff. What I found was a surprisingly good set. Easily on par with some of the best of the Ninjago&nbsp;mid sized vehicles. It forms a nice solid wide tank like vehicle. With lazers and spring missile launchers poised. But it quickly deploys Clay&#39;s airborne strike fighter and two attack cycles, while leaving a slower moving artilery/missile platform in the rear providing backup. It&#39;s a good fun set.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The box is the standard Nexo Nights Yellow and Blues. The front has a nice angled look at the full vehicle with a listing of the 5 figures accross the bottom edge. The sides tell which Nexo&nbsp;Shields come in this set. (They give powers for the online game?) The rear shows the vehicle in action splitting up into its four components to attack. A third of the back is a big banner about the Mobile Game. The instructions are a single large book, rolled and spindled. It has a small sticker sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>How much you love the parts will depend on how new you are to Nexo Knights, but there is lots of coolness here. From the Scurrier, to the new armor and robot parts, to the Trans Neon Orange canopy and other parts. To the new pyramid cheese wedges, to the medium blue blank shield tiles, Just lots of good stuff. Lots of Medium Blue and Dark Blue.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>We get 5 of sorts</p>

<p>Clay - Our titular sword (Claymore) weilding knight. He is nicely overdone in his new NK armor. Big honking breast plate, front and back torso priint. Leg print. A gorgeous two color trans orange and grey sword and his Nexo Shield holder. Weapon and Shield clip nicely onto the flyer and are not an eyesore.</p>

<p>Claybots x2 - 2 of Clay&#39;s little robot squires. They are each the same, although with a dual sided head you can get two different personalities. They are built using a new robot torso, a variant on the Ninjago Skeleton Booted legsThese new rubber shoulder pieces with classic robot arms, a 1x1 printed tile on the chest, a minifig head and a knights helm with pointed visor. Each has a small classic sword.</p>

<p>Ash Attacker - A standard NK lower tier villain. Front and Rear torso print, leg print, dual sided head, cool new helmet with add on horns. He uses a chainsaw sword.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Scurrier - and we get one of the adorable pear shaped red bad guys. I love these things. This is the more common one with the toothy grin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build and Model -&nbsp;</strong>This is a great build experience. Nothing too complex or out of the norm. It all goes together easily and well. It just all makes sense and the end result is solid and satisfying. It is easily the most &quot;Swooshable&quot; vehicle of the Nexo Knights wave. The Sword Fighter is the best part. The little motorcycles while a bit boxy do the job well. The vehicle base unit is a little awkward, not really having a drivers cockpit, instead having a control platform (for missiles?). But it all works. This is a nice fun vehicle.</p>

<p>The Knights vehicle is the only build in the set. The bad guys are just two badly undergeared pedestrians.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I love this set. This is a fun set for an AFOL. This is a fantastic set to give to a child or nephew. This is something that whoever you give it to will enjoy. A+ to the Nexo Knights team for this one.&nbsp;</p>
