"Buku","2016-02-13T12:32:25.957Z","This theme is growing on me","<p>When I first saw Nexo Knights I was not impressed.&nbsp;At all. Nothing could be better than my original Black Falcons Castle right? My daughter likes the show and wanted this set...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is vibrant and&nbsp;colourful. Certainly draws the attention of the kids. One big and one small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of pieces that are new to our collection (Qualifier: we have no bionicle,&nbsp;chima or ninjago where I imagine some of these have appeared before).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The body piece armour of the monster is particularly cool and happily it is a print.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Only Jestro and Lance are true minifigs and both are nicely done.&nbsp;The armour&nbsp;for the nexo knights is considerably bulkier than previous knight theme. My daughter had trouble deciding which of Jestro&#39;s&nbsp;facial expressions&nbsp;to use; she found both funny.</p>

<p>Both the front and the 1x2 tile page of the book&nbsp;of monsters are printed.&nbsp;The large monster is a nice little build in itself.</p>

<p>So all good on this front&nbsp;but, and it is a big but, where are the little monsters? For the largest &#39;baddie&#39; set of this first release I would have expected the inclusion of at least a few.&nbsp;A serious drawback for me. My daughter asked me to get&nbsp;more monsters from the book and was disappointed that it&nbsp;didn&#39;t work.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build starts with the hover horse. It may only be a small build but it is very cleverly put together and certainly looks the part (my personal favourite&nbsp;of the entire build).</p>

<p>The mobile itself doesn&#39;t hold any surprises nor is it difficult. My daughter didn&#39;t particularly&nbsp;get into it until the last stages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not that many stickers which is always a bonus.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It does look&nbsp;great and it is a very different looking machine to anything else in our collection. It moves along ok but that is to be expecting when the monster dragging it doesn&#39;t&nbsp;have wheels.</p>

<p>The lack of monsters to summon is a real drawback to playability; actually there seem to be very few available in the sets as a whole which is at odds with the abundance in the series. A good old fashioned minifigs set would help the theme immensely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My daughter is still happy with it which is the main thing and I&#39;ll admit that the theme is growing on me. It beat my low expectations but I can&#39;t get over the lack&nbsp;of monsters.&nbsp;</p>

"Lego_sorcerer","2016-02-23T03:36:09.62Z","Build and play features? -disappointing","<p>I had been saving my money for this set for a very long time, I mostly got it for Jestro, and to battle against my Fortrex. I found out that the best thing about it was Sparkks!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has the Evil-Mobile riding toward Knightonia&nbsp;with Sparkks keeping his eyes on the road as well as taking a swing at our valiant hero - Lance. It looks like the Evil-Mobile&#39;s eyes are more focused on Lance than Lance&#39;s opponent is! Also it has a trail of fire behind it because fire is flashy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I never cared for parts... at all.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The &quot;Minifigures&quot; couldn&#39;t be much better, (although Lance and Jestro are literally the only 2 real minifigures.) You get Sparkks, a hot-headed giant who has a build very similar to Groot. The Book of Monsters is only 3 pieces, but I assume Lego wanted to have an excuse for &quot;4 minifigures.&quot; Jestro is really great, his minifigure design is nice and I liked the addition of the cape. Finally there is Lance, his weapon is... you guessed it, a lance. His minifigure design is very similar to the other knights... which is a good thing.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty fun, but the wheels are the definition of &quot;ugh, another one, are you kidding me?&quot; If you don&#39;t believe me, just try and build it for yourself.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It was quite nice, definitely not as good as The Fortrex but it does a good job of capturing Jestro&#39;s character. As you can see by the title, I was a little disappointed with the play features, and, as a kid, I have to be picky when it comes to playing. I would be pretty mad if this was the first Lego set I got, because I would have a hard time playing with it and having fun. If you can get past the wacky design and the non-existant&nbsp;play-ability, you have yourself a good set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>That about sums it up, I would give this a 7 out of 10.</p>
