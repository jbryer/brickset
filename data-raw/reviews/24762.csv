<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is in the same style as the &quot;Ninjago&nbsp;Airjitzu&quot;&nbsp;sets. &nbsp;But, with thicker cardboard and in a smaller box.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are a small book. &nbsp;The first two pages you are building the figure. &nbsp;Then the next couple of pages you are building the &quot;backpack&quot;. &nbsp;And you end up finishing building the base / stand for the figure to stand on. &nbsp;The last couple of pages of the book show the &quot;new app&quot; along with the other products&nbsp;you can get in this line. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The &quot;new parts&quot; that come in set are the &quot;shield&quot; and three &quot;printed tiles&quot;. &nbsp;With a transparent &quot;mantle&quot; plus a transparent viser&nbsp;that goes on the helmet witch looks new to me. &nbsp;And last of the new parts are five blue blades that come in the set. &nbsp;Another&nbsp;set of parts to mention are the four &quot;Chima&nbsp;Fire Wings&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You only get the one (Clay). &nbsp;(From the looks of it a special version of him.) &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not to bad, considering their are less than 100 pieces&nbsp;in the set. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Like all of the &quot;Ultimate&quot; sets they come with three &quot;powers&quot;. &nbsp;(Bear in mind I know next nothing about the story, so I am going to make up the names here.)</p>

<p>The first one is Wirl-Wind: it is the mane power and from the looks of it it turns him in to a human helicopter. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The second one is Dragon Spit: this one turns his &quot;helicopter&quot; into spinning flames of death. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The last power is Deflector Field: from the looks of this power it give him an extra shield&nbsp;(to protect&nbsp;his head from the looks of it).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>From the looks of is Clay got some training from General Grievous. &nbsp;But for the price of the set it is not too bad ($10) [better if you can find it on sale]. &nbsp;This is one of those sets where you want another Mini-Figure for Clay fight or train with. &nbsp;(Heck, I would think and other figure would work in this case.) &nbsp;</p>

"LegoLover58","2016-02-08T13:33:48.583Z","Nice parts pack for your money","<p>Ah Nexo Knights. Also known as Knightjago, this is an underrated theme with some really nice sets, some of which include equally nice parts. I&#39;m going to taking a look at the ones I can afford.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box itself is actually really unique and cool. As with all the sets in the line, I like the futuristic look on the boxes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get a very nice assortment of transparent and unique pieces for such a small price. The pieces you get in the set include but are not limited to trans-blue Nexo knight armor (with the 4 studs on the back), Clay&#39;s visor in trans-blue, Chima fire-wings, some mixel pieces, and some very nice trans blue swords that are a new mold. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that we get some of those hole-studs in light grey.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Included in the set is Clay, the main hero of the theme from what I&#39;ve seen of the TV show. He&#39;s essentially the Lloyd Garmadon of Nexo Knights. Anyway, this is a very nice variant of the character, his armor cast almost entirely in blue. the only exceptions are the trans- blue bits of his armor, and the nice orange highlights throughout the model. The sword arms are actually pretty nice-looking on Clay.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is somewhat mediocre, being a simple, smaller build that essentially a weapons rack. It is a nice break, however, from some of the more complicated sets.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>All you have for the completed build is a weapon rack.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set in all honestly is a weapons rack, but a nice one. the set actually has some really nice elements in it.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>We get the usual attractive packaging highlighting the contents to be found within. Specifically, there is a large image of Clay wielding a set of weapons from his armory.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we will find an instruction booklet, 2 bags and no stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set, like all the sets in the Ultimate series of knights and villains comes with many useful parts. We get a trans-clear dish piece in neon orange, 4 mid sized flame pieces 5 dark blue and trans-clear claymore blades and 3 NEXO&nbsp;powers. In addition we get some ball joints and ball joint receivers as well as 4 lightsaber hilts in dark blue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you finish your spare bits should be composed of the following:</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>We get one minifigure but it is by far one of the best in the line. Clay Moorington&nbsp;is well represented here in a dark blue base color with very very fine printing front and back. The figure comes with a duel sided head and a trans-clear armor piece in blue for his torso.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this printing is indicative of the quality and prowess that LEGO has risen to recently. There are fine lines in the armor a good contrast of color and the expressions on the figure&#39;s face are very fitting to his persona. The entire ensemble looks incredible.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>We get our now familiar stand for the Ultimate series of knights and villains&nbsp;that showcase each ability&#39;s power. The figure does look less elegant, however, with all the various attachments but as long as you keep him on that stand it makes for an impressive display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly, none of his NEXO Powers seem that great to me in the companion app. But there is variety here and I am sure different play styles can make use of one or all of these.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2846/33868490400_7375b469c0.jpg[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Once again the NEXO line has managed to greatly impress me. The 2016 line stands in high regard with me. The characters are very cool looking and the figures are amazing and this set is no exception. If you choose to ignore the companion cartoon and games these figures make for great sword and sorcery play and the adventures are infinite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I purchased this set at Target on the first or second day that it was released. The set retails at $9.99, which is a fair price.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box is shaped like the Ninjago Airjitsu set boxes. It shows Clay jumping to heroically attack whatever monsters that you have. I don&rsquo;t particularly like this picture for two reasons. #1 : Clay&rsquo;s arms and legs are moving in ways that a real minifigure&rsquo;s can&rsquo;t. #2: Clay&rsquo;s helmet appears to be only halfway on. But, it&rsquo;s only the box, so it doesn&rsquo;t matter too much. The back is much better, showing a real picture of Clay on his stand and an advertisement for the Merlock 2.0 app. It also shows how you scan the Nexo powers into the game and use them. The instructions are fairly normal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE PARTS</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The part count of this set is down on the lower end since it&rsquo;s a small set, but all the pieces are really good. For starters, we get three of the new Nexo Power elements, plus some dark blue pieces. Then we have four Chima fire wing pieces and three dark blue lightsaber hilts plus one extra. As far as I know, this is the first appearance of the lightsaber hit element re-colored in dark blue and it&rsquo;s awesome! That extra hilt could fit nicely in the hand of a custom Jedi, maybe? Now, last but not least we get not one, not two, not three but FIVE new trans-blue sword blade pieces and some mini-joints. The sword blades look phenomenal!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGURES</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s only one minifigure in this set and it&rsquo;s&hellip;yep, you guessed it! Clay Moorington!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/l43lm2rir/1.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 358px;"" /></p>

<p>Clay is my favorite Nexo Knight, though his name is slightly less than clever. Clay Moorington who uses a Claymore sword? Well, he&rsquo;s still cool despite that. Here&rsquo;s his character blurb from Lego.com: &quot;<em>Clay is all about being a knight. He grew up as an orphan and spent every day striving to become one. Now that his dream has come true, he spends every day training his moves, learning new skills or fighting evil. And when he finally sleeps, he dreams of all the heroic deeds he will perform tomorrow</em>&quot;. As of wave one, Clay only comes in three sets: Clay&rsquo;s Rumble Blade, the Fortrex and this one. Two out of three of those are on the expensive side, so if you like Clay, this set is worth buying.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/lkot8if9v/4.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p>His helmet and visor are new molds and when the visor is flipped down, it looks like Optimus Prime&rsquo;s head to me. In his normal version, Clay&rsquo;s helmet and visor is dark blue and silver. This version has a lighter colored helmet and a trans-blue visor. Lego did a good job of making it look like a knight helmet and high-tech at the same time. His face is a new print, one side showing a determined smirk and the other side showing an angry or maybe shouting face.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/sy477gzbn/2.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/9uavr4mhf/3.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p>Superb. His armor is like the regular version, except there are two extra studs on the back for the robotic arms. The armor is trans-blue, which is really cool. Another thing that I like about it is that Clay&rsquo;s crest isn&rsquo;t printed directly onto the armor, it&rsquo;s on his torso and there&rsquo;s a shield shaped hole in the center of the armor so that you can see the crest when Clay is wearing it. Clay&rsquo;s torso and legs are extremely detailed and the printing quality is excellent. He has shiny circuits and segmented armor covering his torso and legs. he also has his crest printed on his torso, as I mentioned before. His crest is similar to the old Black Falcons. Clay looks great with or without the add-on armor. The shield is a new-to-this-theme piece and though it&rsquo;s a bit large, it looks good. Included are three different Nexo Powers, so you can choose what the shield looks like.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/lyq583zdf/5.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/7toxk1fpv/6.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p>Finally, we have his sword. It&rsquo;s built out of three pieces: a trans-blue sword blade, a dark blue lightsaber hilt and a trans-blue gem. The gem is somewhat bulky and can get in the way when posing or playing with Clay, but it looks kinda cool. You have to decide whether to keep it on or take it off. I personally prefer to take it off. So, now we have the whole minifigure and he looks spectacular! &nbsp;Clay is ready to take on any evil that Jestro throws at him! Globlins beware!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simple and quick. Not much else to say.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/t4mhoaxub/7.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model itself isn&rsquo;t the main focus of the set, but it is a nifty little stand for Clay. The robotic arm pack looks great, though it does make Clay somewhat top heavy, so he stands best when he&rsquo;s on studs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ms7cegus3/8.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p>There are three different modes that the arms can be in. #1: Tornado Blades mode (I&rsquo;m totally making up the names for these modes, so keep that in mind). The arms each hold a twin blade sword.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/rgnc9njyr/9.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p>#2: Dragon Fire mode. Exchange the sword blades for the fire wings to create a spinning, flaming death machine!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/xvmd6bqoj/10.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p>#3: Force field mode. Remove the fire wings and add a force field disk to one arm&hellip;ummm&hellip;to block incoming&hellip;uhh&hellip;Globlins?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6mazrtplf/11.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 383px;"" /></p>

<p>This mode is lame. Just let Clay hold the force field disk or build three more, otherwise you have this weird unfinished looking battle mode. Modes 1 and 2 are epic though! There are places to store the other power mode pieces on the stand when you are not using them. The three Nexo Powers correspond with the power modes. For mode #1 we have a blue Nexo power showing a spinning tornado. For mode #2 we have a red Nexo power depicting a fireball spitting dragon rising out of a sea of fire. And for mode #3 we get a white Nexo power showing a knight head shielded by a force field (Sorry, no pic). The Nexo power looks great, but the mode does not.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OVERALL OPINION</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Verdict.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: Cool Nexo Powers</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epic Minifigure</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great pieces</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some mini joints</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Good Price</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: Dumb power mode</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These sets are great because you can get your favorite Nexo Knights characters without spending tons of money. A must have set. I really enjoyed it. Oh, I forgot to mention: if you have the Merlock 2.0 app, you can scan the Nexo Powers and use them in game.</p>
