<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>We get the usual fare for NEXO Knights with a nice front cover detailing the figure and some of his ultimate weapons. Like all sets for this line in 2016 the box had bright colors and presented a bright and adventurous tone to everything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we will find 2 bags, a manual and no &nbsp;stickers.</p>

<p>The set also comes with a tool box some chicken drum sticks a lightning bolt hand piece and 2 different types of spring loaded shots.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>We get one figure in this set and it is Robin. He comes with everything he needs to fight his foes and then some. Like most figures in this line we get a figure here that has fantastic printing front and back, though I must confess I am partial to the prints on the back of his torso. I think it is the silver column armor print he got. It really looks amazing. Like everything else in NEXO though it is also a huge shame a lot of that excellent printing is hidden behind armor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this set has one great detail that I wish all other NEXO sets had, we get a helmet and a hair piece for Robin. I want a hair piece for the rest of my Knights, why didn&#39;t LEGO do this for the others? Though I do prefer him with his helmet on for any of the powers he is using.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Build:</strong></p>

<p>If you have assembled these before then you know what you are getting here. Still the rotating cannons look pretty cool on Robin if they are a bit ridiculous. His NEXO powers aren&#39;t too shabby either. The one with the chicken legs in particular can come in handy in the game as they tend to linger about and replenish your health when picked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>If you are still working on getting the full line up of Ultimate Knights from last year then this set is a must. The powers included are decent enough but getting all those fun pieces and two distinct pieces of headgear make this a great pick up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also you just gotta use that helmet. Robin looks more fierce with it on!</p>

The torso, legs, hair and head are just the same as the Polybag, unlike the Knights he doesn&rsquo;t get a different colour scheme for his Ultimate Powered up form.</span></span></span></span></p>

This power gives Robin a massive looking backpack with two pressure missile launchers on ball joints that can move independently and be used as extra legs to make Robin taller when he has to fight a Lava Monster.</span></span></span></span></p>

Using it Robin can put on a helmet and throw chicken legs at the enemy&hellip; a really unconventional attack. Not much to it honestly.</span></span></span></span></p>

Honestly, really unusual power, but considering Robin is the mechanic to the NEXO Knights this does suit him.</span></span></span></span></p>

I like the overall look of that build, and I&rsquo;d recommend picking this up if you could get it half price on clearance. It doesn&rsquo;t offer much, but it is nice. Mildly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
