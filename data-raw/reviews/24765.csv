<p><br />
Siendo un fan&aacute;tico de la tem&aacute;tica medieval y lo tecnol&oacute;gico, creo que Lego ha logrado una mezcla muy interesante con esta nueva adici&oacute;n a sus l&iacute;neas de productos. Los Nexo Knights se ven incre&iacute;bles y la jugabilidad que han incluido en estos sets es impresionante.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1524/23723229933_9c702fbaf5.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 333px;"" />&nbsp;</p>

<h3><br />
Partes</h3>

<p><br />
La partes de este set son algo escasas. Aunque el conteo es de 82 piezas en este set (m&aacute;s los sobrantes que incluyen) no es algo muy sustancial. Pero veamo el lado bueno de esto. El set solo cuesta 9.99, tiene una minifigura y 3 sistemas de disparo. Adem&aacute;s de la versatilidad de 3 modos de ataque para mayor interacci&oacute;n en la historia que estemos imaginando.</p>

<h3><br />
Minifiguras</h3>

<p><br />
La figura incluida es Aaron, en su forma Ultimate, dicho de otra forma, una transformaci&oacute;n que lo vuelve muy poderoso. Aaron viene con armadura superior y casco de color verde traslucido. El detalle que incluyen en estos dos elementos es decente pero no tiene ni un tipo de impresi&oacute;n. En el cuerpo de la minifigura si se incluyen impresiones de muy buena calidad detalle. Adem&aacute;s de esto, se incluyen dos modos alternos que seguro te har&aacute;n sentir una variaci&oacute;n para jugar a&uacute;n m&aacute;s.</p>

<h3><br />
La Construcci&oacute;n</h3>

<p><br />
En realidad no hay mayor complejidad en la construcci&oacute;n de este set, ya que lo &uacute;nico que construyes es la base de Aaron m&aacute;s dos soportes para los poderes adicionales que vienen incluidos.</p>

<h3><br />
El Modelo Completo</h3>

<p><br />
Una vez que completas la base, y juegas un poco con Aaron, es bastante interesante. Te incluyen tres lanzadores de proyectiles. Uno es un arco y los otros dos est&aacute;n montados en el exo esqueleto que tiene anclado en la espalda. Las armas incluidas son b&aacute;sicas pero a su vez es un punto a favor ya que al ser puntos de contacto con otros juguetes, al no tener demasiadas piezas, no existe mayor riesgo a ser desbaratado por un golpe mal dado. La armadura por lo general est&aacute; muy bien pero me hubiera gustado que integraran impresiones en la pechera y casco. Aun as&iacute;, se aprecia el detalle. Se incluyen 3 power ups que se pueden escanear con el juego para m&oacute;viles y con ellos superar retos y avanzar con mayor facilidad. Pero el juego lo dejaremos para otra rese&ntilde;a a parte.</p>

<h3>Opini&oacute;n Final</h3>

<p><br />
Aaron Ultimate es una gran adici&oacute;n a la colecci&oacute;n, en especial para iniciarse en el mundo de Nexo Knights. El haber enlazado los escudos con la aplicaci&oacute;n para m&oacute;viles es un toque ideal para coleccionistas y ni&ntilde;os que gustan de ambos mundos, tanto tradicional como digital. Creo que el set es m&aacute;s que ideal y el costo es bastante accesible.&nbsp;<br />

"GBP_Chris","2022-07-27T17:52:44.837Z","Aaron Fox, Plus Assorted Parts","<p>These small NEXO Knights sets are an interesting assortment of pieces with an interesting and unique minifigure to tie it all together. Ultimate Aaron is no exception.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box&nbsp;holds the pieces and instructions.&nbsp;The instructions&nbsp;tell you how to build the set.</p>

<p>... I don&#39;t have a particularly profound insight on Lego boxes.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Ultimate Aaron comes with a variety of useful pieces. He has two stud shooters, a new crossbow, two green fins, a compound bow used earlier for Hawkeye (Marvel Super Heroes) and Soul Archer (Ninjago), a gunmetal helmet with goggles (The LEGO Movie), two A-beams in gray, four bananas, a NEXO shield, and three shield tiles. This is a nice assortment of useful parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Aaron is a fan-favorite character in show, and his set here reflects his livewire personality. The minifig torso and legs are very intricately detailed, the trans-green armor is a new shade, the helmet is a new design, and the visor is a new piece. If you attach the Arrow Strike arms to the back, put the crossbow in hand (which fires really well) and arm Aaron with the Arrow Strike shield, he looks like he&#39;s ready for action.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not the most sophisticated of builds, but creates a nice little display.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great for display on a desk or another similar place. It conveys the NEXO Knights atmosphere and it&#39;s definitely an eye-catching display.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In the end, this set is entirely about the minifigure and the parts selection. What you see is what you get, but for the sake of interesting pieces to add to your collection - not to mention a fun and over-the-top minifigure design.</p>

Each side houses one power and the central section is designed to hold the minifig while wearing the third accessory/power. Ultimately a fairly simple build which is the same in every set, and looks very nice and functional. Not the most thrilling thing to build, however it works for what it&rsquo;s meant to be.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s pretty neat actually, and the massive backpack with twin stud launchers offers a lot of play value.</span></span></span></span></p>

A pretty silly arsenal for him to use.</span></span></span></span></p>

Not much to play with here, but it does give younger fans more options to mix-and-match their Minifigures up.</span></span></span></span></p>

"zorzos","2016-01-26T20:25:33.533Z","So he's a knight.. and he's green!","<p>When Nexo Knights was first introduced, I thought that it had big potential and I instantly downloaded the mobile game. Now after getting this set I see that this will come to be one of my favourite themes. Ultimate Aaron surely does deliver!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box comes in a somewhat conical shape and I opened it from the bottom which I guess you could call a bit unconventional. It has a big image of Aaron along with the images of the three Nexo&nbsp;powers that come with this set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>In my opinion the parts selection is good. I particularly like the new shield pieces, and the printing is excellent. Also we get two shooters, a crossbow and a (should I call it regular?) bow as well.&nbsp;Moreover, the inclusion of the blue elements that form the &quot;base&quot; complement the green in Aaron&#39;s armour&nbsp;nicely. I absolutely love the fact that the minifigure gets additional accessories (if applicable) for each shield you decide to equip it with, for example getting the new helmet with the goggles for when using the bow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Aaron looks simply fantastic. For some reason that I can&#39;t yet put my finger on, a green knight is great. The printing on his torso and legs&nbsp;is excellent and the trans-green armour&nbsp;looks amazing (again, my brain still can&#39;t process how much I like this green knight!).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple,&nbsp;easy and straightforward to follow, the small count of steps is helpful.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I think the following&nbsp;holds true for all the Ultimate Nexo Knights sets: they make fantastic desk companions or can look great when placed next to each other in a row on a shelf for example. The play value is really good, the set allows you to demonstrate all three of Aaron&#39;s shield powers.&nbsp;Possibilities are endless. The little showcase for the shields looks really cool.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great set and an absolute recommendation. I picked Aaron because he&#39;s turning out to be my favourite due to his character,&nbsp;but I&#39;m gonna try and get more Ultimate sets in the near future, these are must-haves. Right know he&#39;s keeping me company while working.&nbsp;Also, as a plus you can scan the three nexo shields included to access them in-game: Arrow Strike, Banana Bombs and Target Blaster.&nbsp;</p>

"Japanbuilder","2016-08-19T12:02:22.403Z","Arsenal to go? Sure! ","<p>This is my first look at an Ultimate Nexo Knight and I must say it was pretty exciting.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box certianly does not raise expectations. It simply shows Aaron leaping into an off-camera frey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only one is included but it is great! Featuring a duel face and printing on the torso (front and back) and legs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Given the very low parts count the build was not too complicated. It only took a few minutes to put together.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a pretty cool display piece in its own right. Though for play it will likely not see too much use as the real draw is using Aaron to attack Jestro and his evil minions.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A great addition to your Nexo Knight team the included powers are also fairly respectable in the side App. The prints and armor look fantastic on Aaron and fit his persona to a T.&nbsp;</p>

"ZG_Brickfilms","2016-05-23T14:36:28.13Z","For the Older Fans ...","<p>Ultimate Aaron includes an exclusive minifig and three Nexo Shields that can be used in game. This all comes in one set that costs only ten dollars.GREAT DEAL!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box for this set is not like most Lego boxes but instead is similar to the boxes that the Airjitzu fliers came in. The instruction book is small but east to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>My favorite part in the set is the arrow shooter. The set also includes two stud shooters as well. The set comes with one shield and three inserts for it. These inserts each have coding in it so it can be scanned into the game. I wish that they also included a set of the same shields in this set but without the coding. If they did this, people wouldn&#39;t get the coding from seeing pictures of the completed set. &nbsp; I know that these pieces already exist because they are shown on the box art. (This is so people can&#39;t get the shields in the game by scanning the box and not buying the set. However, when I do my video review of the set, people can scan my shields and get them for free. If the set also had blank shields, I would show them in the video review and people couldn&#39;t take shields for free and not pay for them.)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifig&nbsp;is Aaron. All his prints are new for 2016 and his armor features nice trans-green colors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is good and easy to put together.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is a stand for Aaron that displays all three shields. The shields can be scanned into the app and it gives you three power ups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shields</p>

<p>Bannana&nbsp;Bomb- this sounds funny but is the best power in this set. It drops giant bombs of bananas. For every kill you make with this power, you gain life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Target Blast- this power up gives you the ability to see how much Heath each opponent has. It tells you which ones will be easier for &nbsp;you to kill. I personally dislike this one because it puts too many things on your screen and makes it difficult to see who&#39;s attacking you. It&#39;s hard to explain but in game this isn&#39;t too useful in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arrow Strike- this power up shoots arrows into the sky and makes them land down onto the battle field. It&#39;s a decent power but I personally don&#39;t use it .</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set isn&#39;t for kids because it isn&#39;t a play set. The set is intended for minifig collectors and people who collect the shields. I am disappointed that it is easy for people to &quot;steal shields&quot; from scanning people&#39;s set pictures but other than that I really like these ultimate sets. I will definitely collect them all for the Knights &nbsp;because it is an easy way to get cool minifigures.&nbsp;</p>
