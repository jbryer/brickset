"lkb57","2016-01-13T18:05:00.85Z","Castle MOC-er likes this (pricey) Nexo Knight set more than expected","<p>When I first saw images of the Nexo Knight line, I was underwhelmed. I&#39;m definitely not a mixer, and the thought of combining castle and sci-fi themes just wasn&#39;t that appealing. But the more I looked at these sets, the more I spotted pieces and minifigs (mostly the villains) that as a castle MOC-er I just couldn&#39;t pass up. This &quot;Ultimate Beastmaster&quot; is my first purchase in the Nexo Knight line, and much to my surprise, I was very impressed. Not just with the piece select, but with the set as a whole . . . there&#39;s something surprisingly retro-Lego about the Nexo Knights that makes them very fun.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll admit, I bought this set for three things: 1) the minifig, 2) the little orange magma monster thingies, and 3) the trans-orange rock piece the Beastmaster stands on. These pieces were all fantastic, as I expected, but I was happy to find that the set comes with a great selection of other pieced as well, including the two short pearl-gold chains, and the trans-purple magic shield thingy, which I&#39;m sure will find it&#39;s way into many of my future mocks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The beastmaster is awesome, and should fit right in with any orc army or fantasy scene you might want to make. His torso is printed front and back with a cool little steel (?) harness, mounted in the front by a badge that resembles the little orange magma monsters he controls. His legs are printed with a continuation of the barbarian-style outfit, and he comes with two facial expressions. Overall he is superb, and I&#39;m definitely planning on acquiring a few more of these.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Quick and simple, but you end up with a cool little stand to place the beastmaster on. I didn&#39;t buy this set for the build, so the fact that it&#39;s so simple wasn&#39;t disappointing to me.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished product is a really cool, and I can see my son really loving this guy, especially since the shield pieces interact with some kind of app that I have yet to check out.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Better than expected. I originally though I&#39;d just put the minifig together, then sort out the pieces into my collection for future use. But I ended up having a lot of fun putting this set together. Definitely recommended as a gift for younger children, or as a piece and minifig resource for castle, LOTR and fantasy MOC-ers.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The standard packaging and instructions for these ultimate sets. Still it has something of a splashy flare since it seems he is about ot burst through the cover.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are interesting the new printed dish with the lightning like swirls is great. Plus those Globlins in orange look great. When you finish you will get a few spare parts including a golden unicorn horn and some other odd pieces. I forgot to include the technic half pin in my shot but you&#39;ll have one spare of those as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figure is the highlight of course and like all the figures in the line this one is fantastic. He has printing front and back and two faces. Though I must say I love his leg prints those globlins in silver look amazing!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was nothing fancy as it did not take long. In fact the stand construction is becoming fairly predictable for these ultimate sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great. The 3 Nexo Powers included are fun but I would not rely them for long term play. The figure itself looks great on his stand and his assortment of weapons and spells are also good to have. The hand piece with drill is pretty dangerous looking and he looks every bit the imposing foe.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am liking these ultimate figures. They come with a good assortment of powers for the associated app and a great arsenal that you can share with your other figures. Really a great value. Though I do take some points off as it seems this figure is no different from the one found in set 70314 The Beast Master Chariot.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></span></p>

It is designed to hang on pegs, if you&rsquo;re a fan of MOSC collecting you can collect all of these and hang them up in your collection room.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Another thing to note is the instruction manuals are all kept in pristine condition with no wrinkles or excess damage.</span></span></span></span></p>

Nothing appears to be different between him and the one found in the main set he comes with, so this is a cheaper method to acquire the character.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">He has two expressions, an angry fierce looking one and an evil smile with a crooked lip curl.

While building these can be repetitive once you&rsquo;ve bought multiples of them they can be rather simple as well, however they are quick to build and give you more parts than you&rsquo;d find in older Spinner sets from Ninjago. It&rsquo;s not like the Speedorz though, it might have been nicer to see something actually created for a decent play function similar to the Speedorz.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Globlin Attack features a unique accessory with a unikitty horn for a drill head and a spinning globlin weapon that can whack the knights in the head and knock them down.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Spirit Vortex: You can keep the globlin weapon on his back here, however I&rsquo;m not sure if that&rsquo;s accurate, it probably is though otherwise you&rsquo;d have very little to play with. Basically you have a printed dish identical to the one with Cosmic Boy. This can be held in Beast Master&rsquo;s hand, or perhaps attached to the hand weapon, either wait it isn&rsquo;t much to look at or discuss.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Dynamighty: The final Nexo Power is just a pair of dynamite sticks. Beast Master can hold them to launch and that&rsquo;s pretty much all the functionality you get out of the physical power, in the App I&rsquo;d wager it looks more exciting.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></span></p>

There is basically not much to do with him, the Nexo Powers in physical form are really lacking and ultimately the biggest draw for the set is the Minifigure, and perhaps some of the parts. Definitely not worth full asking price, I&rsquo;d recommend this when on clearance for clearance pricing because 13$ at full Canadian retail is not worth it.</span></span></span></span></p>
