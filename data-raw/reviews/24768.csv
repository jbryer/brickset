"Bobsy","2016-02-17T15:33:13.72Z","Cheap and cheerful, a welcome surprise for a dragon set...","<p>Dragons have been a staple ingredient in the <em>Ninjago </em>line from the very start, but were originally among the more... &#39;aspirational&#39; type of sets. You know, the kind that kids have to spend the whole year pleading with mum and dad to get for their birthday to even have a chance of seeing in the flesh?</p>

<p>It&#39;s a pleasant surprise therefore to find in the latest wave of <em>Ninjago </em>sets a dragon that can be had for pocket money, coming in as it does at a wallet-pleasing &pound;8. But with fewer than 100 pieces, does it merit even that low price?</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a goodly selection of ball joints on offer here - the wings, tail and head use the smaller kind introduced with <em>Mixels</em>, and the chunky legs use the larger type. Along with these are a pair of A-frame pieces for the wings - hardly rare any more but still welcome additions, and five scythe heads in pearl gold.</p>

<p>For both pirate and ninja there are a bunch of accessories, including two flintlock pistols, a skull-handle cutlass, scythe (ninjas love good lawn maintenance) and the year&#39;s gimmick, a bone-handled energy sword thing with a ninja&#39;s face on it and two massive axe blades. To be honest, the hilt looks better without the axe blades, and thankfully there&#39;s a spare brown handle they can be attached too - free battleaxe!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The dragon&#39;s rider is Cole, who I always vaguely admired in the early days of Ninjago, being the only one of the team that was dressed in any sense ready for ninja work. Or at least, being a Noh Theatre stagehand, given the black outfit he sports. Nowadays of course, the rest of the team have mostly caught up and wear black as well, and in response Cole seems to have lost the plot by wearing a Sashimono flag on the back, confidently letting his enemies know not only <em>where </em>he is but <em>who </em>he is at all times. Top-quality ninja-ing there, Cole.</p>

<p>The pirate, who has the unfortunate name &#39;Bucko&#39; is dressed in classic pirate gear: dark green and bright orange, with a snazzy silver logo on his lapel. Because even among vicious gangs of marauding thieves and vagabonds <em>branding is important, dangit</em>. There&#39;s little else to say about him to be honest - he doesn&#39;t look bad by any means, but he&#39;s just not interesting enough to waste words on.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I always enjoy brick-built creatures using ball-joint articulation and Cole&#39;s mighty dragon-cub is no exception. It doesn&#39;t take long to put together, especially as it is entirely symmetrical, but kept my interest throughout.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The dragon uses the same colour scheme that has been following Cole&#39;s models around for years, earth tones of brown, black and pale green, offset with gold highlights. The number of articulation points makes for a very posable model, although as with all such creatures this comes at the price of stability and sturdiness. But being such a small model, repairs are quick and easy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good-looking creature as well, almost entirely brick-built (only the feet are pre-moulded pieces, sadly a small letdown). The A-frame pieces give a good shape to the wings, although obviously their aerodynamic properties leave something to be desired, having great big whacking holes in the middle. The dragon is actually more akin to a wyvern, as it has no forelegs, but this is mere pedantry on my part.</p>

<p>One odd quirk is that the lower jaw is permanently fixed in an open position. It can swivel left and right, but never close. Poor thing, unable to hum.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Aside from freebie polybags, I&#39;m always a little wary of sets with fewer than 100 pieces. There&#39;s a limit to how far small numbers of pieces can go, and it usually represents poor value for money on a part-by-part basis.</p>

<p>Happily Cole&#39;s Dragon is, like all good Lego sets, more than the sum of its parts. This isn&#39;t just an affordable dragon, it&#39;s actually a really great dragon, an excellent model, fun to swoop and swoosh around and play with, and unlike its predecessors, it won&#39;t break the bank.</p>

<p>It also makes a good companion model to <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70603-1/Raid-Zeppelin"">70603-1: Raid Zeppelin</a>, a far better model than the weird silver hover-thingy that came with that set, and a more dynamic foe for the small airship.</p>

<p>Cole&#39;s Dragon was never going to be an unmissable set - anything this small and low-price could never be. But for &pound;8 it&#39;s hard to imagine anything more fun.</p>

"Hylocera","2016-05-07T05:34:46.287Z","Great Start to Skybound","<p>Picked this set up with a few others in the Skybound&nbsp;subtheme. Definitely a high point in the life of Ninjago. This is also my first review with pictures. Please forgive the poor photo quality, as I was in a hurry, and&nbsp;unable to set up my light box.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box came a little dented for me, since it had to travel across the entire country. Otherwise, no surprises. The official pictures here on Brickset pretty much cover everything here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The dragon is loaded with Mixels joints, finishing with 15 (out of 98 total parts) of them in various forms. Otherwise, this is a decent parts pack for useful reddish brown and black pieces.&nbsp;Some of the most interesting parts (IMHO) are included below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7672/26793117031_f64687ccf4_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 530px;"" /></p>

<p>There is a good amount of sand green cheese slopes (olive green on the very right for comparison) in this set, along with 2 of the newish &quot;A-frame&quot; pieces, a black part that looks like a cross between a dalek (Earling) and a blaster, 2 small inverted bows, and of course, the Djinn blade, this one housing Zane.</p>

<p>The set&#39;s five stickers come on a friendly-sized sheet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7113/26826892346_ef9b6fb08d_c.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figures are typical Ninjago figures. Cole has a new Skybound design that is common to the other ninjas. Bucko sports the new headband/bandana piece in dark green, and his detailed torso and legs would fit perfectly with any sort of steampunk/fantasy setup. Cole&nbsp; comes with a flag on his back, a detail that I don&#39;t think any other Ninjago figure has.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7643/26793115271_ff22b3cae6_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The flag is simply the 2x2 piece stickered on both sides with the same design, but it looks fantastic, good enough for me to apply them both while not applying the other 3 stickers included. I&#39;m not sure why Cole was singled out to have this feature, but I would love to see more figures with these.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There is not too much interesting here - for the most part, the dragon is a mass of Mixels joints with limbs attached. I would, however, like to mention the head.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7274/26826897426_61c39cfc14_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The head is built around a skeleton consisting of a single dalek (aka. Earling) attached to the aforementioned camera-esque piece, onto which other details are added. The final result is a stellar example of what is possible at this scale. The lower jaw&nbsp;can swing from side-to-side due to its clip+bar construction, but for the most part is pretty stable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished dragon is actually quite large, larger than most sets at the same price point. It is simultaneously a ferocious and adorable little guy, with great detail throughout.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7337/26826898916_5186968ee3_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The wings are very parts-efficient, using the A-frames to create a lovely (and accurate?) shape for them. Really my only issue with the finished model are the legs and feet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7281/26255287094_93d4e05087_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>From the front, the feet and legs are awkwardly large, each foot as large as the dragon&#39;s head. They stick out from the sides of the body, which from the side looks fine, and even from behind isn&#39;t much of an issue, but from the front they look tacked on and overall pretty bad. Brick-built feet would have been a better option, like those in Kai&#39;s Mini Dragon. Speaking of which...</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7434/26255289144_aec0d795c5_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I had both dragons, so I decided to do a quick size comparison. Of course, Cole&#39;s is much larger, with 50 more parts than Kai&#39;s.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7706/26256342783_880cfce846_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Cole&#39;s dragon looks especially good from this angle, showing the perfect shaping of its wings. Kai&#39;s is a little lacking, with unnaturally straight wings. Still, both are great models, and I think they would go really well together in a MOC or diorama.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great little set. 98 pieces (plus 10 extras) for $10 is already a great deal for MOCers like myself, with the added bonus of the finished product looking great from most angles and including 2 very nice minifigures. I would definitely recommend this to anybody looking for a small dragon, to complete their Skybound collection, or a good brown/black/Mixels joints parts pack.</p>

<p>EDIT: I forgot a picture of the extras. Here they are! :)</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-08-08T19:27:26.963Z","Little brown gem","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Cole&#39;s Dragon seems to be the smallest of the non-polybag&nbsp;dragons included in the Ninjago range between 2015 and 2017, and it was the only one missing from my collection. It&nbsp;had been on my wishlist for a while, and seeing the supply dwindling, I bit the bullet and ordered it from Bricklink. Taking it very easy, and taking my time with the stickers, it was good for 20 minutes of building fun. The dragon itself is IMHO excellent in size, and combined with the two minifigures&nbsp;offered&nbsp;great value at the original RRP; if you can still find it somewhere for a reasonable price, I would definitely pick it up.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build is quick and easy;&nbsp;I took my time applying the stickers. The build itself is simple, but a very good example of what can be done with a limited number of pieces. Quite a number of the techniques used can also be seen in the construction of the other brick-built dragons found in Ninjago&nbsp;sets between 2015 and 2017. The legs and feet seem a bit out of place, but frankly I cannot see how it could have been done differently, as they are needed for stability.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are two minifigures included in this set. The villain is Bucko, who is a common criminal, found in three other sets. This version of Cole is unique. It is a&nbsp;non-ghost Cole, and as a result he has a normal face, and though the pattern of the print on his torso and legs is identical to at least two &#39;ghost-Coles&#39;, but the grey&nbsp;seems to be darker in this version. I really like this minifigure. He has a nice battle flag, and is armed with a scythe like weapon.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>This dragon is by far the smallest of the non-polybag brick-built dragons in the Ninjago&nbsp;line-up released between 2015 and 2017. In style it fits nicely with the Ninja-controlled dragons, beginning with the like of <strong>Master Wu&#39;s Dragon (set 70734)</strong>, the <strong>Green NRG Dragon (set 70593)</strong>&nbsp;and ending with the dragon from <strong>Dragon&#39;s forge (set 70627)</strong>. The colour scheme - the brown colour - has been fairly consistently associated with Cole: the original <strong>Earth Dragon (set 2509) </strong>and his <strong>Quake Mech (set 70632) </strong>from the Ninjago&nbsp;Movie are other examples. While the oversized claws/feet detract somewhat from the overall looks; however, the additional stability (and thus posability) it provides far outweighs this negative.&nbsp;Similarly, the head might be slightly oversized, but now it possesses a moveable beak, which I consider a plus. Overall I think the designer has done a cracking job.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>Above all this is a little, fun play set, especially in combination with other small Ninjago sets. The many hinges allow for a lot of movement in the dragon. There are&nbsp;also a villain and ninja to contest the Djinn sword.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suprisingly - somewhat, considering its size - I think this model could also work as a little display model. And it definitely belongs in a line-up of the bigger dragons.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is an excellent little set. If you still see it somewhere for a reasonable price, do not hesitate to pick it up. It is a fun little build, of a little handsome dragon and two nice minifigures. A lot of bang for buck.</p>
