<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Pretty typical stuff; box much wider than it is tall; two instruction booklets. I think in my last review I said the excess of instruction booklets in smaller sets didn&#39;t really bother me, just confused me. Yeah I lied. It sounds nitpicky, but having to switch to another booklet halfway through a relatively short build is getting tiring. Not sure why the instructions can&#39;t all be printed on one, larger, booklet. Before I forget: here&#39;s a picture of the box&#39;s contents.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I forgot to take pictures of interesting parts...HOWEVER, most of the good stuff should be visible in the official pictures. The Skybound monkey, his/its grappling hook thing, lots of trans-light blue (like <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6032799"">this joint</a>, which only appears in trans-light blue in 2 other sets), and lots of dark blue. The biggest surprise for me was the use of a dark blue <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6136739"">Metalbeard&#39;s beard</a>&nbsp;for the dragon&#39;s lower jaw, and a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6086765"">lime green syringe </a>clipped to the saddle on the dragon.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8090/27783314183_505e74a764_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The set comes with 2 and a half figs: Jay (1), Cyren (1), and the monkey thing (1/2). Cyren does not have a necessarily female torso, instead wearing one that is the same as the other pirate in the picture (he is <strong>not</strong> included in the set).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7571/28399354425_33d00ec333_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Cyren does come with an older Prince of Persia scabbard, though, which fits her cutlass nicely. It also fits katanas, as it was originally meant to. Unfortunately, the new Skybound saber does not fit into the scabbard. However, there is an extra cutlass (the one that fits) included in the set, so I swapped out the bigger sword with that one, for a bit more consistency. I hope I didn&#39;t lose you in there.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not too much here. The dragon&#39;s head uses droid arms to connect the jaw to the rest of the head, so it is actually double-jointed. This is my first reasonably sized dragon, so it was a fun build. The dragon&#39;s legs are identical, which makes for a few minutes of very monotonous building. I just built them all at once and skipped ~20 pages in the instructions. :D</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8585/27783311643_3165533b2f_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The set in its entirety. There is a better picture of the extras further down. This set stretched the limits of my very small photo setup, hence the decrease in photo quality. The dragon <em>is</em>&nbsp;standing on two legs in the above picture, which is&nbsp;a pretty fun way to pose it. Unfortunately, it was not made for this pose, and looks better/is more stable on all fours. This is also the first time I have gotten a six-stud shooter (here, on Cyren&#39;s plane), and I have to say, they are a LOT of fun to play with. It&#39;s a good thing LEGO included 6 studs as extra ammunition, or I&#39;d lose them all in a week.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8841/28399351245_06f1707d79_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>But now we must move on to issues with the set. Thankfully, from most angles the dragon looks epic, and the mix of trans-blue with normal blue is very eye-catching. But from this shot, the mess of colors in the body is more evident. There&#39;s grey and black scattered everywhere without any real consistency. I&#39;m guessing the ball joints on the legs only come in dark bley, because I can&#39;t see another reason for using that color there. There&#39;s no reason for dark bley to be anywhere on the dragon, actually. Next, the shoulders of the wings are fixed. You can see the red technic axle near the center of the picture above. This greatly limits the poseability of the wings, and looks awkward when the wings are posed in certain ways. There is a way to remedy this that I have not tried: replace the axles with <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4206482"">these pins</a>, and the technic bricks with <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/370026"">these ones</a>. I&#39;m not sure if that will make the wings too wobbly, but it should at least allow a slightly larger range of motion.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8747/27783308913_bb94f8190d_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>And now the biggest problem (IMHO) with the set: what is this tail? <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70599-1/Cole-s-Dragon"">Cole&#39;s Dragon</a>, which is much, much smaller, also has a 1-stud wide tail. A dragon this size shouldn&#39;t have a tail like that.&nbsp;Of course, a 2-stud wide tail would look equally awkward. If I find a way to make a tail that starts 2-wide and tapers to 1-wide, I&#39;ll definitely add pictures to this review, but the way the set is&nbsp;right now, the tail is just way, way too small.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c4.staticflickr.com/9/8703/27783306643_f1a76b55df_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Finally, the hip joints on the rear legs stick out...a lot. Honestly, it just feels like the whole rear end of the dragon is a different scale than the rest, like someone took an oversized Cole&#39;s Dragon, cut it in half, and slapped on the rear end to this set. A few plates and bricks here and there should fix this part pretty easily. Oh, and the pearl gold 2x2 tiles on either side of Jay are printed, thank goodness.</p>

<p>Actually, there&#39;s one more issue. The neck is attached to the body with click hinges, meaning it can only move up and down. That would be fine...if the head had more poseability. It&#39;s kinda locked forward. It can tilt up a little, down a little, to the side a little, but not nearly as much as it can turn completely upside down.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c8.staticflickr.com/9/8128/28399349615_27917884c1_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Despite all that&nbsp;criticism, the finished dragon + plane thing (which, by the way, has comparatively fewer faults) look quite good. When I display the dragon, I put it in the back corner relative to the rest of my Skybound sets, and from that angle most of the problems are invisible, and it looks pretty awesome. For $30, this is definitely a nice dragon to pick up, although some of the earlier Ninjago ones look even better. Thanks for reading!</p>

"Faefrost","2017-01-04T03:41:21.037Z","A nice mid sized Ninjago Dragon at a good price point","<p>First up a confession. I have been growing steadily disenchanted with Ninjago&#39;s ever present Dragon offerings. It&#39;s not that they are bad. It&#39;s just that they are starting to get a little repetitive. There are maybe a few to many Lego Dragons running around now. From Ninjago to Elves to Classic Castle to Smaug. What used to be a rare delight now overwelm the shelves. But with that said, this is a really nice brick built dragon. It&#39;s got a lot of pop and style to it. It feels very swooshable. (Plus Jay&#39;s old school lightning dragon is the one I never managed to get so I have room for a blue one ;)</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions -&nbsp;</strong>The box is one of the more striking ones of the Sky Pirates series. The standard red trim with Jay&#39;s eyes looking down from the upper right just works well with teh heavy sky blue of the main set art. Lots of nice contrast that draws the eye. The picture features the dragon in a dynamic pose facing off against Cyren&nbsp;on her flyer against a sky and cloud background. The back typically shows the features. Instructions are one rolled up stapled booklet. There is a smallish sticker sheet. The stickers do add a lot to the Dragon, but given some of the parts that they go on, you might wish to refrain from some. I think the ones on the head are the ones most needed for the overall look. The ones on the trans blue wings look nice, but you might want to keep those gorgeous parts unstickered.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>The set has two regular minifigs and one animal fig.</p>

<p>Jay - We have Jay in his full Sky Pirates suit. Font back and leg printing with some nice bold art. This version has his 2 color hood instead of his hair and the newer 1 shoulder pauldron with side by side sword sheath. Disappointingly he only has his standard single sided face. So no eyepatch here. He comes with two gold swords. There is also a blue Djin Blade. I am a little unsure of which Ninja is trapped in this one. The 1x1 printed round tile is a light blue? Not the darker blue of Jay. Maybe its supposed to be Zane? Overall Jay is a really nice figure. Although he is not unique to this set.</p>

<p>Cyren - ninjago always needs more female characters, and Sky Pirate Cyren is a great offering. A nice green and brown armored outfit. Front/Back and leg printing that seems a bit more detailed than the other Pirates. her face with eye patch and beauty mark. she has a dual sided head to give some emotion. I&#39;ve never been crazy about the hair they use for her, but it works well enough. she also includes a prince of Persia style crossed sword sheath without shoulder armor, on her back. There are two smaller Classic Pirates style sabers included that fit this sheath. Her main weapons are two of the larger wavy Sky Pirate cutlasses in gunmetal. They can&#39;t be sheathed, but can be clipped on her flyer.</p>

<p>Monkey Wretch - Monkey wretch is the Classic Pirates Monkey, from among other things 6243 Brickbeards Bounty, only recast in pearl silver with three orange and one silver arm. Honestly this figure has always been more than a bit awkward and creepy to me. It uses 4 standard minifig arms instead of legs, which seem odd by todays standards. It has no printing so the face is just a dull silver grey mask of terror. The monkey kind of worked as just a denizen of the ship back in Classic Pirates. As a named character in Sky Pirates it really kind of fails. It has no personality. he comes with a stud shooter cleverly rigged using an Apollo stud, a length of chain with 2 studs and a grapling hook to act as a grappling gun. Very Batman&#39;ish. Sadly Monkey wretch is the unique minifig for this set. I believe Cyren and this version of Jay show up elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>There are some really cool parts in this set. The most obvious being the Trans Blue wing parts. It also has several of the trans blue elemental blades from an earlier season to further shape the wings. Some nice trans blue 2x2 slopes. Perhaps most interestingly the Dragon uses Metalbeard&#39;s&nbsp;Beard piece from TLM sets in Dark Blue. This is only the third time the piece has been used and the first in any color other than pearl grey.</p>

<p><strong>Build/Model -&nbsp;</strong>The first build is Cyren&#39;s little flyer. It&#39;s fairly minimalist as far as such things go. Basically two dark orange technic wings essentially attached to a sic stud shooter with a small engine at the rear. The nicest element are the use of two of the wavy Sky Pirate swords in white as landing skids. It would make a nice little polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main build is the Dragon itself. It&#39;s fairly simple and pretty straightforward. If you have built one Ninjago dragon you know what you are getting here. It&#39;s a 4 legged dragon. It has some nice shaping, but what really make sit pop is the coloring. All the blue, dark blue, trans blue and gold details come together and really pop. The only negative is the tail is rather scrawny and rat like. It is made from the smaller mixel ball joint pieces and just lacks something. Jay&#39;s seat is nice with some good details. Clipped in behind him is a short brown tube piece and a bright green medical syringe to represent the Tiger Widow Venom dart and blowgun that he is taking to use against the Djin Nadakhan. While the head shaping is not the best of the Ninjago Dragons (see Master Wu&#39;s Dragon), it&#39;s distinct and not bad for a brick built head. It still looks much better than the old original rubber heads or the ones they use for elves.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overview -&nbsp;</strong>It&#39;s a great set at a great value point. There is nothing overly unique or distinct about it. If you have been a long time Ninjago fan you have seen this same basic type set many times before. The minifigs can be found in other sets, save I believe the creepy and likely demonic monkey that is the stuff of nightmares in all the wrong ways. But it&#39;s still a great set. It&#39;s a fun set. It&#39;s a set a kid will swoosh around and have a blast with.&nbsp;</p>

"digi_raptor","2021-03-09T18:40:47.913Z","A GREAT Jay dragon","<p>This is an amazing Jay dragon for Ninjago the only thing I don&#39;t like is the random white protruding pieces coming from the dragon&#39;s head in the set, the side build is cool, the dragon is one of the best Jay dragons, the figures are great, it comes with the tiger widow venom in a blow dart, it uses metal beards beard in blue as a jaw and it shoots spring-loaded missiles from its wings</p>

<p>This is a great dragon and I definitely recommend getting it if you can find it at a good price nowadays.</p>
