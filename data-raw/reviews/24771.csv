"phembo","2016-02-27T08:08:45.303Z","Super Swooshable Flying Pirates","<p>Saw this set in the preview press last year and the incongruous combination of elements just grabbed me totally. I had seen the balloon pieces in several sets but this design did something unexpected to combine the pirate theme with the flying ability and&nbsp;quasi-technological Ninjago world. It was a madness I had to experience for myself.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is chunky and gives a good impression of the final models.&nbsp;Two books of instructions splits the work up in an odd way. The first does the ninja craft and most of the base of the pirate ship. The last, which is larger, only adds the balloon, wings and a few details.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Three bags, each with one inner bag, very few large pieces.&nbsp;The colour&nbsp;scheme of the parts in general gives a range of complimentary shades and could build various haphazard piratey things. Quite a few technic pieces are hidden away. Some to construct the base and many pegs and rods to hold the balloon up.</p>

<p>Of course the balloon pieces are the star but what was&nbsp;not obvious to me and was quite a dissappointment is that you only get 7 - not enough for a complete balloon shape. The build hides it well but this spoils the symmetry of&nbsp;MOC&#39;s&nbsp;with an upright balloon. When it becomes available on bricks and pieces I will definitely get an eighth.</p>

<p>As consolation we get two new prints and two old ones.&nbsp;A tiny trans blue round tile with an excellent image of ninja eyes staring out is new. It goes on the super weapon and you get a spare, the rest of the range I guess has other colours. Also there are two round dark grey tiles with centre&nbsp;hole and&nbsp;printed tri blade design. Not used in a very exciting way here but could definitely add a lot to another design. The old prints are computer displays on 2x2 roof tiles.</p>

<p>The jagged cutlass for the pirates seems a new part&nbsp;and you get several of them in two colours. Also the dark green epaulets are a new colour which might appeal to historical MOCers. A&nbsp;good sized&nbsp;rubber flag is flown at the back and the ninjago themed skull and crossbones on it looks excellent.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Ninja Zane has black suit with white arms and a blue lion head on the front. His head is a silver robot look which was a bit surprising, I guess the cartoon would explain. He is armed with double sabres&nbsp;which have a new gold sheath piece with a great smooth fit.</p>

<p>The pirates are great too, the boss Dubloon has a white skull face with scary or sombre expressions. The lizard man Clancee was my definite favourite. He has a peg leg and orange armour print and is equipped with a mop and bucket!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Lots of variety in construction. Comes with the front half of a boat prow and the rest of the structure is technic or plates and bricks. A few stickers with one slightly tricky one being a 2x4 tile but it its fairly hidden so if it messes up it won&#39;t be easy to see.</p>

<p>My favourite&nbsp;bit of construction came fairly early when the cannon and figurehead for the front of the ship is built. It builds up in a very satisfying way to make an eerie dragon-like face. Down the side are some white claws that enhance the look from the front of the ship.</p>

<p>The structure to hold the balloon is a little tricky to assemble and clip into place but is rigid when constructed. Getting the balloon sheafs all lined up is both infuriating and satisfying.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It does not sit flat on the table, the wings need to be flapped up about 20 degrees before it will do so. This looks a bit messy if you don&#39;t keep fussing with it but encourages you to pick it up. The rigid structure, light build and lack of protrusions make this a pleasure. Swooshing is what this was made for.</p>

<p>Perhaps by accident the mini craft for zane also doesn&#39;t sit flat with the wings being not strong enough to hold its weight. This makes it easy to pick it up and flick the wings around into different shapes as you hold it. Thus together they make a perfect pair, inviting to pick up and play with and well built enough to handle it.</p>

<p>Additionally there is a play feature on the main ship that only becomes useful when you pick it up. it has a well built and satisfying movement and is great to use.</p>

<p>My only gripes might be that the deck of the main ship is cramped so moving the pirates around is fiddly. The cannon also is embedded slightly in the deck so firing it can be tricky, but I have big adult hands to so a kid may&nbsp;not have trouble.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is firstly a toy and second a minifigure&nbsp;set. Two ships, with similar play styles work really well together and could satisfy any lego kid. The anachronistic look of the balloon might turn off the spaceship fans but if they get past that they will find it a sweet build.</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2016-06-20T00:26:59.56Z","Watch Out Zane!","<p>I got this set one day&nbsp;. To be honest, this set is really cool and has a bunch of play features The minifigures and the parts selection are great. Let&#39;s jump onto the review and see what you think&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: The box has great artwork on it on the front. On the back, you get typical action features and whatnot. The instructions are pretty clear, as usual.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: The parts on the whole are good. This set contains a exclusive and collectable Djinn blade, this one trapping the spirit of Jay. The new balloon pieces are excellent. The new pirate lag is an excellent piece. The steering wheel is a rare piece and it is nice to see it here. We also get other rare parts and recolors.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: The minifigures are really great. First we have Zane, with dual faces, both are pretty good. Zane&#39;s attire contains the darker colors which blends with the white. I really like this feature. Zane also has a new scabbard I really enjoy. Doubloon has two good masks, as well as typical pirate attire, a samurai helmet and nice new pirate swords. Clancee is just as good, featuring a peg leg, typical piate attire, and a cool snake head, this time molded in green. The djinn blade is wonderful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The building experience was pretty fun on the whole. However, I do not really like technic parts and needed help for that. I really enjoyed assembling it&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: The completed model is wonderful. The skull is really detailed. The cannon and the stud shooters work very effectively and make the model look piratey. The pirate flag is nice, as well as the steering wheel. The balloon is really good. Zane&#39;s craft is nice, featuring spinner blades, stud shooters and really advanced technology. However, there are a couple disadvantages. As I said earlier, not a fan of technic parts, but that is my opinion. however, their isn&#39;t much space on the ship for minifigures and their accessories. The balloon also isn&#39;t a full balloon, but I can&#39;t blame Lego for that. Now, I&#39;ll talk about the play features. First, you can fire the cannon on front of the ship. There are also two stud shooters on the sides. &nbsp;The most prominent feature on the Zeppelin is you can pull a hinge on the back, and on the deck, you can drop a barrel of dynamite on your opponents. On Zane&#39;s craft, you can fire two stud shooters and move the spinner blades up and down. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: This set is really fun. Despite a couple disadvantages, this set has lots of play features and really nice figures. The price is perfect. It really looks nice displayed on my shelf, making it both a collector&#39;s and children&#39;s item. Overall, I like this set and I highly recommend it for you.&nbsp;</p>

"Hylocera","2016-07-04T17:15:31.75Z","It's not made of Led","<p>Sorry for the pun.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just going to say this right now: this set is one of the best, aesthetically, ever made by LEGO.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing special here. The set comes in one of the longer boxes that has become the norm for sets at this price point.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The first thing I noticed before buying this set was the new balloon pieces, here in dark orange and unique to this set in that color. The balloon is the perfect color for steampunk MOC&#39;s, normal hot air balloons, or just MOC&#39;s in general.</p>

<p>In the box there are 2 plastic flags (1 extra) packed with the instructions; for whatever reason, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70605-1/Misfortune-s-Keep"">Misfortune&#39;s Keep</a> only comes with 1.</p>

<p>The Djinn blade included is Jay&#39;s (or contains Jay?).</p>

<p>There are a number of useful white pieces used in constructing Zane&#39;s speeder and the skull on the bow of the zeppelin. There is also a sticker for a 2x4 black tile with control panel designs. And, like almost every other pirate vehicle in this subtheme, the wings are mounted with anchors.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is the only set in the first wave of Skybound with Clancee and Doubloon, the two pirates included. Doubloon will appear again in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70593-1/The-Green-NRG-Dragon"">the Green NRG Dragon</a>, and Clancee in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70594-1/The-Lighthouse-Siege"">the Lighthouse Siege</a>. Both of them look fantastic, especially Doubloon with the samurai-esque printing on his head. His head is double-sided, but the other side is just an upside down version of the front...not sure if this is an error or intentional. Clancee has a snake head that is much more simply molded than some of the stranger snake characters that has appeared in this theme. As a result, it doesn&#39;t look nearly as ridiculous as some of the latter characters. Clancee also comes equipped with a broom. I&#39;m not sure what good that would do in a fight...</p>

<p>Right now it looks like Zane in his Skybound outfit is unique to this set. He has a pearl silver head, one with a plain face and the other with some sort of blue HUD covering it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Zane&#39;s speeder is a very quick build, probably under 30 pieces, but is still fun to make. The use of&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6058342"">Ninjago spinners</a>&nbsp;as wings/propellers looks great. I don&#39;t really like where the stud shooters are, though. I moved them to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4210660"">bar on the bottom</a>&nbsp;and added spears where they originally were, for a more swooshy look.</p>

<p>The zeppelin is a lot of fun to build, and it is a good mix of unavoidable, repetitive parts and more interesting parts, like building a certain play function and making the balloon. The balloon and the awning over the computer consoles on the back make for a nice switch from system to Technic building techniques, and finishing touches on the zeppelin bring it back to system. The highlight of this build was definitely either making the skull at the front, or mounting the balloon. One thing about the balloon: to make a complete one, you need 8 of the new balloon pieces. This one has 7. The reason being, the bottom one is left out to make room for the technic beams used to attach the balloon to the hull of the ship. It&#39;s unavoidable, as there&#39;s no other way to mount the balloon at this angle, but it does mean you can&#39;t make a complete balloon later if you wanted to.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When finished, the zeppelin looks so. Darn. Good. With a few SNOT modifications and color tidying&nbsp;for the hull, I might easily have mistaken this for a build by an expert MOCer. It is surprisingly light for its size, and is one of the most swooshable ships I&#39;ve ever built. The colors chosen are just perfect. There is a little bit of inconsistency in the hull, but most of this is covered with details like the skeletal arms and the bracket-mounted wings. There are 4 stud shooters on the deck of the ship and 1 brick-shooting cannon, as well as 2 more stud shooters on Zane&#39;s speeder.</p>

<p>The last play feature is the bombing function. There is a tile in the center of the ship where a barrel with dynamite fits very snugly. This tile is actually the top of a&nbsp;long 2 x something plate that pokes out just 1 stud in the back. By pulling this part in the back, you can create a hole where the dynamite is, allowing it to fall. It is a lot of fun to play with, and I only stopped to avoid damaging the barrel/dynamite pieces.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>So yeah, this is one of my favorite sets. It fits perfectly into my growing Skybound display, but even on its own is a stunning model. It captures the steampunk aesthetic perfectly, and does so at a reasonable price. It is actually pretty big for the price point, and at just about 300 pieces (I&#39;m including extras), it fits the &quot;golden ratio&quot; of 10c / piece almost perfectly. If I see these on sale, I might even pick up a couple more to make a little fleet. It&#39;s that good.</p>

"Faefrost","2017-01-04T04:30:13.52Z","An unexpectedly good set","<p>I really wasn&#39;t expecting to like this set. Something about the balloon parts set me off, plus I had seen some grousing about it online that left me sure I would be disapointed. I really only got it for the minifigs. Boy was I mistaken. I love this thing. There is something very compelling. Very swooshable about it. It just draws the eye and hands. This one is going onto my permanent display hovering over my Pirate ships. I was really not expecting that. This is not to say that there are not some flaws or negatives, just that they really aren&#39;t as big as I was expecting.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box -&nbsp;</strong>The box really pops out at you. It&#39;s the standard Sky Pirates trim of Red with Jays head. The main picture is the blue cloud background with the Zepelin&nbsp;very large in the front while Zane swoops in on his little flyer. Instructions were two stapled booklets, stuffed into the box. There is a very small sticker sheet. Mainly the control panels on the Raid Zepelin. They are quite nice and worth applying.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The set comes with three minifigs. All very nice.</p>

<p>Zane - Sky Pirates outfit Zane with his one shoulder gold pauldron/sheath and his dual colored black and white hood. His head is silver with dual sided printing. His standard silver face and his blue tactical visor face. he comes with two gold swords and 2 ninja stars. he has the standard Sky Pirates print. Very crisp and gorgeous. Front/Back/Legs. His base color is black with white trim. Very little silver other than his head. This Sky Pirates (Skybound?) version of Zane is unique to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clancy - Clancy is the weird little toadying Serpentine Mutant that found a home among the Sky Pirates. He is actually one of the more likable characters from the TV show. He has nice crisp front and back printing. No leg printing although one leg is a peg leg. His head is the Anacondrai&nbsp;head from last years Tournament of Elements series recast in Lime Green. An almost identicle&nbsp;figure appears in the set 70594 Lighthouse Siege. The only difference is this one here has the Classic Pirates officers epaulet piece in dark green . The Lighthouse version of Clancy has the wavy shoulder armor used for the Ninjago Stone Warriors, also recast in dark green. his weapon is a mop with a spike on it and a bucket. 9He likes scrubbing the ship.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doubloon - The &quot;Two Faced Thief Doubloon&quot; is by far the BEST looking figure in the Skybound lineup. And it&#39;s all about the face. His body has the same front/back and leg printing as Cyren. A nice green and brown armor with orange arms. He wears a Samurai helmet in Dark Green with a bucket handle crest like Samurai X. What really makes him pop is his head. It is a white head with a dual sided Kabuki Mask that is just gorgeous. It gives him way more personality than you are expecting. He has dark green epaulet&#39;s and weilds two wavy bladed pirate swords. Like Clancy a slightly different version shows up in the Green NRG Dragon set. This one having the Dark Green Wavy Stone Army shoulder armor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>There are a lot of interesting parts here, particularly a lot of orange, but really at the end of the day it&#39;s really all about those distinct Dark Orange Balloon parts. They are both the sets biggest draw and it&#39;s biggest flaw. They are really cool. And you could find plenty of MOC&#39;ing uses for them, except for one problem. They only give you 7 instead of the full set of 8. The bottom piece of the pie is missing on the Zepelin. So you can&#39;t use the included balloon pieces to make a balloon. This is the sets biggest negative. Almost unforgivable.</p>

<p><strong>Build/Model -&nbsp;</strong>Ok first up on the build list is Zane&#39;s little flyer. Made using two old school Ninjago Spinner tops in Pearl silver. It has two stud shooters and is quite frankly CR*P! It&#39;s ugly, it doesn&#39;t swoosh well, Zane does not peg on and has to simply awkwardly hold the handlebars. It&#39;s one of the worst little flyers they have cooked up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving on we have the Raid Zepelin itself. and it is a really really nice build. The bottom boat section is really solid, with some nice play features and a surprising amount of deck space to pose figures. I have 5 Pirate minifigs standing on mine. The main play feature is you have a barrel containing dynamite that can be dropped from a&nbsp;center hatch unto unsuspecting Ninja. Granted the choice to use &quot;Barrel Bombs&quot; in hindsight might not have been the years most politically correct or tactful design elements. But it&#39;s still a cool play feature. (OK they have the theme with the&nbsp;Arabian themed Djini&nbsp;villain dropping Barrel Bombs on our heroes... oh dear! ) Moving on the ship also has a Classic Pirate type spring cannon on the bow. The construction of the ship is rock solid. Moreso than you would have expected. The picture looks like on two thin spars hold the balloon on, but they are so well anchored at both ends that you could drop the ship to no separation. The only flaw is the gaping hole at the bottom of the gas bag where that missing 8th piece of the balloon would go. That is visually the worst element of the set, although it does really only become apparent when viewed from below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>I really love this set in spite of it&#39;s flaws. The figures are fantastic. The ship just draws your eye. As an adult you want to play with it. I can only imagine kids will love it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also no discussion of this set would be complete without pointing out the forthcoming cousin to it. The more colorful Elves 41184&nbsp;Aira&#39;s&nbsp;Air Ship.&nbsp;http://brickset.com/sets/41184-1/Aira-s-Air-Ship-and-the-Hunt-for-the-Amulet&nbsp;I can&#39;t help but think that that one would make a nice companion piece to display alongside this one. A sort of Steampunk Airship dual.&nbsp;</p>

But the side build shouldn&#39;t stop you from getting this good set. If you can find it for a price you are willing to pay, get it. I definitely recommend it</p>

<p>Skybound Zane, great looking minifigure with a nice sword holder</p>

<p>Doubloon, my personal favourite main sky pirate</p>
