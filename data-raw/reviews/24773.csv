<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>Standard box and Insructions, does its job well, The car looks striking on the front, helps being yellow</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>173 parts, so not the biggest set, but similar size to other cars from the speed champion series. There is also a sticker sheet with this set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Just the one, the driver, in Corvette race overalls which are mainly white, black arms and a red crash helmet.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve built a few of the cars from the speed champions series, even with having the same principle to each car, I&#39;ve always found every build different which makes the experience better</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>A nice compact modal, stickers add to the effect and presentation of the set, I&#39;m not a big fan of stickers but they make it look a whole better, it&#39;s amazing the set looks like the real car in Lego form great credit to the designer.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I like this set, looks great, the presentation in Yellow is superb, I think the car fits in well with other cars from the Speed Champions series and is good value for money, the speed camera is a nice little touch</p>

It has a great look - very stylish - and the model feels really sturdy and weighty. I let my little nephew play with this one and it stood up to all the abuse a 2 year old could dish out without falling to pieces.</p>

<p>If you are more refined in your LEGO appreciation then this one will also sit very nicely in a display, perhaps alongside the other Speed Champions. The lines and shapes are really pleasing ang the color really makes it jump out when you get a nice bright light on it.</p>

<p>I did a stop motion build of mine which you can <a href=""https://youtu.be/OemdaEYEwyQ"">see on my YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;. I&#39;d love to get some feedback on it.</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-17T20:00:00.71Z","1x1 Stickers on a Cheese Slope? Seriously?","<p>As you might have guessed from the title, I had some issues with&nbsp;75870-1: Chevrolet Corvette Z06. Were they enough to effect my review? 100%.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure/Scenery: As usual, the minifigure was mediocre. Plain helmet and legs with a absolutely common head. Terribly boring like almost all Speed Champion set figures. The torso is nice for the unique print but that&#39;s a small thing really.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The camera is a nice touch though. I might add it to a bank as a security camera or a stop light as a red light camera. Hey, LEGO cities need money too.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: This was a bit more intricate that I expected, especially on the front end. The build though is just marred because of the stickers. The headlights are set on 1x1&nbsp;cheese slopes. Absolutely infuriating to try and apply. Plus they look terrible when you make a mistake, as is easy with this type of piece and sticker. What&#39;s worse is that LEGO provides a 1x2&nbsp;yellow tile with black printing on 2/3rds of it to help with shading on the sides. What if you don&#39;t apply the stickers? Well the car looks incomplete.&nbsp;So frustrating.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: While a worthy addition to the lineup, I can&#39;t really recommend this set because of how frustrating the stickers made the build; they ruined the experience for me, thinking back on the build yesterday. It&#39;s never a good sign when the memorable part of the build was frustration.&nbsp;</p>
