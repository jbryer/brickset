"PooPotato","2016-03-27T19:34:28.193Z","My First Non-Star Wars Review!","<p>If you&#39;ve read any of my previous reviews, you will have noticed by now that I am a rabid Star Wars fan, and that an overwhelming portion of my Lego collection consists of Star Wars. &nbsp;It&#39;s very rare that any other themes catch my eye/wallet, but when I first saw that Lego would be releasing American sports cars for their next run of Speed Champions sets, I became very interested. &nbsp;Considering I am an American, and that I am particularly fond of Mustangs, Camaros, and Challengers, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer, especially for $15.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was as sturdy as ever, but sadly had to be open via the punch-out provided on the side of the box. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a less destructive way to open these types of boxes, but I wasn&#39;t really keen on putting off the build any longer, so I went through with the punch-out method. &nbsp;The instruction booklet wasn&#39;t remarkable, aside from some Ford licensing printed on the front.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As you can tell, a vast majority of the pieces included with this set are of bright blue and white. &nbsp;I think that this is the perfect color for any Mustang, especially with a racing stripe or two, so this was perfectly acceptable. &nbsp;The only piece that I&#39;ve never seen before is the windscreen piece, which has appeared in many of the other Speed Champions sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One minifigure is included. &nbsp;This is the first set&nbsp;I&#39;ve had in years that has come with a minifigure with a yellow head&nbsp;(collectable minifigs don&#39;t count as sets). &nbsp;He comes with a white and blue racing jacket with Ford logos on the front and back, along with a white racing helmet and an adjustable&nbsp;wrench. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was relatively straightforward, and nothing really surprised me that much. &nbsp;It began with the building of the lap sign thing, and then moved onto the car itself. &nbsp;I really like how the car looks with it&#39;s SNOT, it&#39;s absolutely perfect. &nbsp;I am also impressed with how the designer was able to capture the sleek feeling and look of the doors of the Mustang without using stickers. &nbsp;Speaking of stickers, there&#39;s A LOT of them in this $15 set. &nbsp;In all honesty, you are better off applying all of them, as the back window, headlights, front grille, and taillights are all portrayed with the stickers. &nbsp;I was first at a loss as to why the set came with 8 sets of hubcaps for the wheels, but I learned upon closer inspection that half of them have a different amount of spokes than the other four. &nbsp;I like the look of the 5 spoke pattern, but I think that it&#39;s very cool of Lego to give us that customization option.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks awesome. &nbsp;I think that the car looks at it&#39;s absolute best from a side profile, so that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to sit on my shelf when I display it. &nbsp;The stickers are a pain to put on, but only improve the look of the model as a whole. &nbsp;The only thing it might be lacking in is play features, but when play features are implemented, you almost always lose a key feature of the source material at hand, which is unacceptable with a $15 set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am very happy to have this set in my collection. &nbsp;For $15 you get an awesome looking car, a unique minifigure, and a couple of accessories. &nbsp;I wish that the Star Wars theme followed this formula more often, as some of my favorite sets lie in that $15-$40 price range. &nbsp;The only real problem I&#39;m having now is where I&#39;m going to display the Mustang, as 99% of my collection is Star Wars. &nbsp;I also plan on purchasing the Camaro Drag Race set, so I might need to build another shelf specifically for Speed Champions sets...</p>

"charliebucket","2016-07-11T04:51:26.207Z","Quite possibly the best lego set under $30 NZD","<p>Tonight on &quot;Top Stud&quot;:&nbsp;I review what could be the best minifig&nbsp;scale car that Lego have ever produced! :D</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is rectangular in shape and quite small, with the back showing different angles of the car, and an image of the real life Mustang GT. &nbsp;Opening the box, you will find 3 bags of varying sizes, 1 oversized sticker sheet and one instruction book. &nbsp;The instructions are, for the size of the model, very thick&nbsp;but easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part selection is great: 185 extremely useful and newer molds of&nbsp;pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The one included minifig&nbsp;has a racing jacket with the Ford logo on it, and, with a very&nbsp;happy face, he is ready to race!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The assembly&nbsp;of the model is very enjoyable! &nbsp;With many interesting building techniques coupled with a fun build, this is&nbsp;one to take your time with. &nbsp;My only complaint about the build is that there are too many stickers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model looks incredible! &nbsp;About as realistic as they could make it whilst keeping it minifig scale.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is not only the best minifig scale car that Lego have produced; but the best small Lego set EVER! &nbsp;Plus with 185 pieces, this model is true value for money!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope this helped you choose your next Lego set :)</p>

"TheCahleySlash","2018-01-30T00:06:11.637Z","A muscular GT","<p>A good first release of a Ford car in Lego, but not without it&#39;s flaws.</p>

<p>The box has a gloss finish, flimpsy cardboard, on the rear view of the box&nbsp;is three teaser angles of the built car along with a photo of the&nbsp;Mustang GT car, that is very nice.</p>

<p>On to the build, I find the minifigure&nbsp;is decent enough, I like the torso the most, it&#39;s great to see a &#39;ford&#39; logo in Lego. The head, the dark blue arms and legs, are also a useful parts for MOCers.</p>

<p>The side build is a simplistic design lap time display&nbsp;and it does the job sufficient for price, but it could be more grand in design with more height.</p>

<p>For the car I find there are a bit too many stickers, though I like some of the stickers like the grill and roof stickers are authentic and enhance the appearance&nbsp;of this car, the challenge of applying 1x1 on cheese slopes is hard to do correct. The blue colour scheme is matching, but unfortunately all of the stickers have either a&nbsp;blue or&nbsp;white background, so it would be hard to reuse the stickers for a different colour build of this model&nbsp;with the same parts.</p>

<p>I find the front to be&nbsp;too long, it could have been shorter by a stud. The lights stickers&nbsp;that are on the side, does bother me, as the actual car has the lights facing a different angle. The back of the car is suitable with&nbsp;a nice part used as the exhaust and GT logo sticker. Lastly the inclusion of extra rims is always welcome.</p>

<p>I find this car to be quite sturdy and strong enough for children to play with and not break. The car is vey playable and makes a good display piece.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say this is a&nbsp;true, good&nbsp;muscle car and with release of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75884-1/1968-Ford-Mustang-Fastback"">75884</a>&nbsp;(1968 Ford Mustang Fastback) in 2018, this car&nbsp;will be a must&nbsp;have!</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-19T00:09:01.53Z","This Mustang Ponies Up","<p>Another review, another Speed Champions set, this time&nbsp;75871-1: Ford Mustang GT. Does this set work, despite the use of stickers on 1x1 slopes? Read below to find out.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifugure/Scenery: Boring as usual, the minifigure had only the Mustang printed torso for a unique piece, while the rest is common and disappointing. The scenery is a track clock. Good for parts but not much else.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The car build is actually quite detailed for such a small set, which was a bit surprising. The hood and trunk look great when compared to the real car. The lines and elevated tiles really do capture the outline of the GT. Even the bane of my existence with Speed Champions sets, the stickers, were not too difficult. The two 1x1&nbsp;slopes that get stickers are on the sides of the model, which means any slight errors aren&#39;t glaringly staring back at you like on the Corvette.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict: Much like the 1967 Fastback, this Mustang raves to the front of the Speed Champions pack. Maybe it&#39;s the lines on a Ford, but they do look much better than other brands in Speed Champions sets. I highly recommend.&nbsp;</p>
