<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has clear photos of the models as well as photos of the actual cars for reference. &nbsp;They could have found a black and white classic Camaro instead of the orange one. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of angles to create the sides, front and rear of the vehicles. &nbsp;The set includes a number of the 2x2 wings which are new. &nbsp;The classic Camaro also has &#39;chrome&#39; bumpers which is a nice touch. &nbsp;I feel like the axle pins are smoother than the 2015 cars. &nbsp;These ones roll quite freely. &nbsp;The printed wheel centres are nice and you get an extra one, it will be a nice radiator cap on a future MOC.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The female driver is a nice twist but she has a helmet and no hair. &nbsp;The others are fairly standard one sided mini fig heads.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Both cars offer interesting building techniques. &nbsp;The front of the new Camaro is pretty cleverly represented but it feels a little heavy in the back. &nbsp;The classic Camaro is quite well done and captures the curve of the car quite well. &nbsp;I wish it didn&#39;t have the larger rear tires so that you could have had 4 of the new wheel wells in black. &nbsp;The starting gate has a nice light switch feature for race play. &nbsp;You also get an air intake or a supercharger for the hood of the classic car.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This line is plagued with stickers and these cars are no exception. &nbsp;The racing stripe on the middle of the older model looks good but the stickers don&#39;t quite reach the width of the tiles. &nbsp;They look good and are to scale with the others in the line.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am satisfied with the build and like the little details that are included on each car. &nbsp;I will probably put proper headlights in place of the stickers on the black Camaro.</p>
