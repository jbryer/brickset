However, this Captain Phasma has dragged me back surprisingly easily. As a huge Star Wars fan I was drawn initially by the diversity of merchandise LEGO had on offer, especially with the Buildable Figures. The Captain Phasma iteration of this set is a fantastic piece of kit.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard cardboard box as per LEGO norms. The scenes on the back are nice tips for possible posesnthough. The instruction booklet is quite slim but efficient.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The cloth cape came packaged separately. It is clearly a high quality piece and the red trim looks excellent on the completed figure. The figure parts come in two bags, with the centre&nbsp;frame being lose in the box. At 82 parts it is an easy but relaxing build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Personally, I found the build quite relaxing and enjoyable. I had a pretty stressful work week and taking my time I had the figure built in about forty-five&nbsp;minutes. If I had concentrated properly it probably would have been a fifteen minute build. The construction is nice though and well thought out which I appreciated.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great. Instead of a chrome finish as per the film, the LEGO Captain Phasma is finished in silver effect plastic. I think this was a wise choice, the contrast of the black and silver looks great. The finishing to Phasma&#39;s helmet is a nice touch. The poseability of the right gun arm is limited and to my opinion fails to give a proper effect The body shield looks great however. I have placed Phasma on a shelf in my study.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great build for &euro;24.99. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I will certainly be adding to my LEGO collection because of it.</p>
