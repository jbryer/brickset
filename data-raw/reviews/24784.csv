"Nouri","2016-01-07T17:39:38.947Z","A Respectable Improvement!","<p>Being that it may, I love Micro Fighters. I feel as though they&#39;re as close as Lego can get to selling Licensed Minifigures without a huge build to&nbsp;go along with it. However, this set hits both marks completely fine serving its role as both a good build and a worthy contender to get amongst other Micro Fighters. Especially if you want an awesome exclusive Resistance Figher&nbsp;pilot!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Box size is very standard for Micro Fighters which is usually just a small rectangle. The Box art features the X-Wing as well as it&#39;s Pilot on the Starkiller Base with some small explosions towards the bottom of the box. Not much else other than that.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Parts</span></h3>

<p>This X-Wing comes with some very nice parts including a variety of blue and light bluish gray elements. The blue elements are a very nice addition as they&#39;re not as common as most other colors. The dark bluish gray half cylinders are also very welcome pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The lone minifigure that comes with this set makes this whole set worth it alone! It features a so far exclusive helmet print that is very welcome to any Star Wars collectors collection. The head I believe I also another exclusive element although don&#39;t quote me on that one. The torso and legs feature extraordinarily nice printing that is a respectable improvement upon previous iterations of star wars pilots. The minifigure also comes with a lone blaster pistol to compliment it in battle.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward and consists primarily of the body of the X-Wing followed by the 4 wings which are practically the same build. In this sense this X-Wing looks and feels considerably similar to the previous Micro Fighters X-Wing Set 75032 X-Wing Fighter however this set has some notable improvements.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Completed Model looks absolutely amazing for what it is and really offers a great compromise between both the standard Micro Fighters feel and a Move Accurate model. This model is a bit skinnier than the previous X-Wing model and it features a new design for the engine exhaust at the front using half cylinder pieces over the previous full cylinder pieces which helps trim the build down. From the back the engines look very standard although fit the build well. The blasters at the end of the X-Wings wings are also flick fire for added playability for kis and the like. Finally, the top of the build right after the cockpit features enough space to fit an astromech droid head if it suits you although one does not&nbsp;come with the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is a hit in my book. It comes with a great exclusive minifigure that is complimented well by a fairly nice model especially for a Micro Fighter. For investors I see this as a great investment opportunity given that the figure stays exclusive. For collectors this is just another Micro Fighter to add to your collection! Finally, for just those who want a cheap set to play with or gift for a birthday party this set will serve its purpose for a long time indeed.</p>

"joemmo","2016-01-14T21:18:53.763Z","A Fun-sized X-Wing for your pocket money","<p>Buying the series one X-Wing back in 2013 signalled my re-entry into Lego so I have a fondness for the Microfighter theme and have since collected most of the series 1 &amp; 2 kits from the film series.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not so interested in the Series 3 &#39;Rebels&#39; sets but was looking forward to the Force Awakens Microfighters and was interested to see how this compared to the &#39;mark 1&#39; X-Wing so didn&#39;t hesitate to grab this as soon as I saw it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>With a standard 3/4 angle picture of the X-Wing on the front, the box art ties this thematically to 75126 First Order Snowspeeder, which is also shown on the back of the box in the background. Instructions are in a small leaflet and build the model up in small steps, so it&#39;s good for junior builders.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Fairly unremarkable and mostly in grey, black and blue. Multiple wedge plates for the wings and fuselage, the &#39;spine&#39; of the ship uses a stepped plate to keep it solid and you get 4 half round bricks and plenty of flick missile rods. The flat studs in trans pink provide a nice splash of colour as the glowing jets. There&#39;s just one extra of these and a clear cheese wedge left over as spares.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Definitely a strong point of this set, not only one of the new resistance pilots but with an exclusive bearded face and unique helmet print. He&#39;s a recognisable character from the film too called &#39;Snap Wexley&#39;.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1519/24317065186_444b142b36_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
The two part helmet mould has a transparent yellow visor and a white outer shell with very detailed printing in blue and black. Both torso and legs are printed and use a dark orange colour rather than the bright orange used on the original trilogy pilots. I&#39;m a bit on the fence about whether this is a good approximation of the suit colour in the film but there&#39;s no denying the figure looks great.</p>

<p><br />
As usual, he comes equipped with a mini blaster which can be stowed on a clip behind the cockpit.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A quick model to put together and fairly conventional in construction. The fuselage is built up in layers of different colours to create the side stripe then 2 pairs of the mirrored left and right wings which clip onto bar pieces at the sides - a bit repetitive but easy to do. I did like the detail added to the rear to create a hexagonal shape and the whole model is sturdy so it&#39;s good for play.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The photos didn&#39;t look all that exciting if I&#39;m honest but actually this comes together into a good little model that is better than expected. Whilst very similar in parts and build, it actually captures the look and stance of an X-Wing better than the series 1 model, which has a narrower wingspan and stubbier wings. I might even modify my series 1 kit to have a similar wing construction.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1601/24260774551_80ab8778ef_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
The half round bricks look OK as the trademark front engine sections though they don&#39;t create a circle when closed - but Lego haven&#39;t managed that with the full scale model either. A printed brick certainly would have looked great here but no doubt would reduced the margins. Colourwise, the grey and blue looks fine but they could have chosen to interpret the grey as white and it would have made a more striking model IMHO.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1489/24260776751_2319d32c15_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
It doesn&#39;t replicate the split wing design at all but after trying to mod it to achieve that I can understand why they compromised on that aspect. I&#39;m a little disappointed that it doesn&#39;t include a R# droid head behind the pilot but there is space and with a little change you could fit one of your own there.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the original and new X-Wings together&nbsp;for comparison.<img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1547/23716405093_85b904f802_z.jpg"" style=""width: 640px; height: 480px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
The one thing that bugs me though is that the model cannot be sat on its base with the wings fully open because the wingtips fold down lower than the bottom of the hull. One solution is to fit a clear block or 2 underneath to lift it up which works fine if you want to display it but not so good for zooming about.<br />
<br />
Another little mod you can do if you don&#39;t like the way the cannons are represented as flick fire missiles is to just plug one missile stick stud end first into the holder. It&#39;s a firm fit and looks a bit more &#39;authentic&#39;.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A good model that captures the essence of the design well in the Microfighter style. It&#39;s robust enough for play, makes a good desktop ornament, has a great minifig and in my opinion is one of the stronger out of the three series so far. I&#39;m looking forward to another round of TFA themed sets and maybe some from &#39;Rogue One&#39; later in the year too.</p>

This makes for a rather one-sided battle when paired against the other. However the set is quite enjoyable and I&rsquo;d like to discuss why that is in this very review.</span></span></span></span></p>

The typical jumpsuit design is represented here with a great double-sided torso print and leg printing. The LEGO Force Awakens prints are really impressive with the details truly showcasing the levels LEGO has reached with such intricate design elements, there is so much detail and personality in the torso alone it just looks like tiny artwork.</span></span></span></span></p>

For play features you get four flick-fire missiles where the ship&rsquo;s blasters would normally be. They represent the weapons nicely, but add a level of play, even if it is unrealistic to think a pilot would launch his blasters at the enemy thus rendering him powerless to defend himself.</span></span></span></span></p>

It does have its flaws, the wings are very limited in how you can maneuver them and the central nosecone might be a little too snub for this snub fighter. There are no markings on it for prints or stickers, which does make this a little bland, but overall I still enjoy the sheer fun of the model as it is still highly playable.</span></span></span></span></p>

They are a quirky fun sub-theme in the LEGO Star Wars Theme that offers up amusing ship designs and interesting Minifigures. Many of the ships get recommended by me because of their very fun nature, they are a quick build and can be played with readily as soon as their built.</span></span></span></span></p>

There are no unique or impressive parts for MOC fans and the colour palette is pretty uniform without genuine personality. Having Poe&rsquo;s unique dark black and orange colour scheme with Snap as the pilot wouldn&rsquo;t have worked out as well unfortunately, however I still recommend this set. It&rsquo;s great fun and can easily be used as a template for MOCing many more Resistance X-Wings provided you can get the parts for them.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Wookiesmasher13","2016-06-27T17:31:11.86Z","I was expecting more","<p>Box/Instructions: It is a normal box and clear instructions as always.</p>

<p>Parts: The helmet is very nice and detailed. Not much else.</p>

<p>Minifigures: Snap Wexley is very nice and what pulled this set up from scrap. He is movie accurate and a nice addition to Blue Squadron.</p>

<p>The build: I was expecting more, especially with Series #1 X-Wing in my collection. The issue is that the wings don&#39;t settle flat in cruising mode. Another issue is that the blasters on the S-Foils fall off without studs with holes like used in Series #1. It is more aerodynamic looking than Series #1, which is a plus. I would like to see a combination of the plusses of the two.</p>

<p>Overall opinion: The minifigure&nbsp;makes the set pretty nice, but the X-Wing is mediocre.</p>
