The vehicle looked fun&nbsp;and the minifig is the same as featured in the full size speeder set 75100 so I grabbed a set as soon as it appeared at my local supermarket.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard small box size with the product / action shot on the front and rear with the snowy Starkiller Base background theme tying it to the new 75125 X-Wing. The back shows the rest of the series 3 range paired up by theme with&nbsp;other 2 pairs from SW Rebels.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing particularly rare or exotic here and predominantly in grey and black, appropriately for the design. The main form is defined with simple angled and sloping bricks and plates but there is plenty of detail added with grill tiles,&nbsp;black tapered 2x2 cylinders and a couple of black lightsaber handles as guns. The front&nbsp;cannon features a studshooter attached with a technic angle connector and some trans orange &#39;coin&#39; studs detail the engine jets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Possibly the star of the set, it&#39;s one of the new First Order Snowtroopers complete with backpack and&nbsp;blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1665/23571233033_7f0ae640a5_h.jpg"" style=""height: 1200px; width: 1600px;"" /></p>

<p>This is really a nice figure with crisp and detailed printing on torso and legs, new helmet design plus a printed 1x1 tile that attaches to the character via a neck bracket. Underneath the helmet its just the old clone face though, it would be nice to get some variety in expression and skin colour.</p>

<p>Finally, unlike most Microfighter&nbsp;minifigs, this comes with a regular mid sized blaster rather than the mini size.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As with most sets this size it was fairly straightforward with some simple SNOT&nbsp;techniques used to get the front and rear end shaping, which they achieve quite&nbsp;well. There&#39;s some nice greebling detail with the sloping grill and flat 2*1 grill pieces and the trans orange studs used for jets provide a splash of colour in an otherwise grey model.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1629/24198038305_283823ee28_h.jpg"" style=""width: 1600px; height: 1200px;"" /></p>

<p>I also liked the way the studshooter has been built into the front as a swiveling gun, it&nbsp;works really well and is&nbsp;much more satisfying than a flick missile for play value. If you don&#39;t like the stud shooter then you can fit the spare lightsaber handle instead of the green stud for a slightly more aggressive look.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a compact chunky model as befits the style, the driver/pilot sits in nicely and it just has a good playable feel to it. It sits alongside other Microfighters well and the scale, IMHO, is better than the larger Lego version which is a little bloated. This would actually fit in well with the TFA battlepacks, especially as the Resistance pack comes with a similar vehicle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re a fan of the Microfighter line then you&#39;ll probably want to get this, it&#39;s also a cheap way to get the Snowtrooper minifig and is one of the 2 cheapest TFA sets. Does it represent&nbsp;the source vehicle accurately? Well, there&#39;s a slight problem there because...</p>

<p>[VERY, VERY MINOR SPOILER]&nbsp;</p>

<p>... it&#39;s hardly featured in the film at all. In fact you may have a hard time spotting&nbsp;it. I recently bought the Force Awakens concept art book (recommended!) and it has some shots of the speeder and suggests that it was part of a chase sequence that must have been cut. Judging from the images then this and the larger set are reasonable versions of the design but it&#39;s interesting to note that the large Lego First Order Snowspeeder&nbsp;actually looks about 30% too big compared to the minifigures.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Perhaps we&#39;ll see it appearing on the next film or perhaps its starring scene&nbsp;was edited out, I&#39;ll guess we&#39;ll have to wait and see. Regardless, it&#39;s a decent set and as mentioned would make a good addition to the battlepacks or a Microfighter collection.</p>

"Nookman8","2016-08-07T00:10:53.123Z","An Amazing Microfighter!","<p>Hello&nbsp;everyone and welcome back to one another one of my reviews! This time, I&#39;m covering the &quot;<strong>First Order Snowspeeder</strong>&quot; from the LEGO Star Wars&nbsp;theme.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small and can easily be picked up by one hand. The box shows the set itself&nbsp;on a snowy planet which could be considered &quot;Starkiller Base&quot;. It has no borders what-so-ever and has info&nbsp;about itself on the left. It has the &quot;Microfighters&quot; logo in the bottom-left corner. along with the Disney one on the right. Series 3 is shown above Disney with a gold background behind the text.</p>

<p>The back shows the it in combat against 75125 &quot;<strong>Resistance X-Wing Fighter</strong>&quot; and it shows the single action feature in this set. (which I will cover later) The bottom of the back is covered with all of the series 3 Microfighter sets.</p>

<p>The instructions were, once again, easy to follow and had no ads in it what-so-ever.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set you definitely&nbsp;shouldn&#39;t get for&nbsp;nice&nbsp;parts as it only comes with&nbsp;four.&nbsp;There&#39;s a black lightsaber hilt, two black unprinted&nbsp;R5 series heads, and a nice printed 1X1 tile&nbsp;for the snowtrooper&#39;s backpack. (They even give you a second one with the extra pieces! Score!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There&#39;s only one minifigure in this set but,&nbsp;it&#39;s an awesome one.</p>

<h3>First Order&nbsp;Snowtrooper</h3>

<p>&nbsp;<img alt=""First Order Snowtrooper Version 2"" src=""http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/lego/images/2/26/First_Order_Snowtrooper_Version_2.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20151205182604"" /></p>

<p>Now, before I go into any&nbsp;detail, I want you to guess what the difference is between this one and the one that came in last year&#39;s normal-sized snowspeeder. Here, I&#39;ll give you a picture of the other one.</p>

<p><img alt=""Lego First Order Snowtrooper"" src=""http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/lego/images/c/c4/Lego_First_Order_Snowtrooper.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/137?cb=20150925165228"" /></p>

<p>Notice anything yet? Well, the difference is one has a kama (See picture below to see what one looks like in LEGO)&nbsp;and the other doesn&#39;t!</p>

<p><img src=""http://cache.lego.com/media/bricks/4/2/6076778.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Okay, now that we&#39;re back into the review, let&#39;s take a look at his details, shall we?</p>

<p>The snowtrooper&nbsp;has print from head to to-I mean, leg. The detailing is extremely detailed which is awesome, as this figure comes in a ten dollar set. He also has some slight black printing but nothing noteworthy back there besides the backpack. That backpack is a 1X1 tile piece connected by a neck-piece which actually isn&#39;t that noticeable.</p>

<p>His face is the normal &quot;Angry Clone Face&quot; that we &nbsp;have come to see on clone and stormtroopers&nbsp;ever since 2013. The helmet is a nice plastic printed piece with printing even on the back and he comes with a standard blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is nice,&nbsp;simple, and fun!</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model&nbsp;looks great! In fact, it could even work as its own little First Order ship. It represents the normal one perfect even with its size. The only action feature with it is the stud-shooter on the front with you shoot trans-lime&nbsp;green studs with. The twin thrusters can also spin around but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s supposed to be a play function.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is well worth the ten bucks and it comes with an amazing minifigure and an amazing mini snowspeeder. Still not sold? Let&#39;s end this then!</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>In conclusion:</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Snowspeeder+Minifigure=Awesome!</li>
	<li>Play Function is a nice little&nbsp;add-on to an already amazing set</li>
	<li>NO STICKERS!</li>
</ul>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Piece selection&nbsp;is&nbsp;meh.</li>
</ul>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>So, I give this set a 4.5 rating and 5 stars for the Brickset&nbsp;rating. Thanks for reading and I hope you found this review helpful!</p>

The only flaw is the use of the Clone/Stormtrooper Head, underneath that helmet is standard Imperial and Republic era facial printing that is standard for these masked troopers. A real disappointment compared to everything else that makes this one of the best troopers I&rsquo;ve seen from LEGO.</span></span></span></span></p>

"FowlerBricks","2016-09-27T19:58:06.003Z","Small...but spectacular!!","<p>This is my second Force Awakens set (<em>the first being C3-PO. I&#39;ll be doing a review for him sometime soon</em>) and it&#39;s my first MicroFighter. I wasn&#39;t all that excited about the MicroFighters, so I wasn&#39;t buying them, but then&nbsp;my cousins gave me this set and it just might make me want to buy more.&nbsp;The set is small and fairly simple, but it packs a punch! Let&#39;s get started and see why this set is so awesome.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A small, rather fat box with nice pictures. Not a whole ton to talk about, though on the back, it shows a silhouette of the&nbsp;75125: Resistance X-wing Fighter that is advertised to go along with this set. Instructions: nothing out of the ordinary.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of gray and black pieces. Lots of roof slant pieces and wing pieces. Nice trans green and trans neon orange studs.&nbsp;The parts can fit pretty much anywhere else if you for some reason decide it&#39;s not worth keeping built.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure included is&nbsp;a First Order Snowtrooper. The Snowtroopers have shown up in one other set so far, which was&nbsp;75100: First Order Snowspeeder but that set is pretty large. It retails at forty dollars so I never got it. The printing on this minifigure is superb, with amazing armor detail. His backpack/heater has some great printing and it goes on a black neck brace, which&nbsp;is fairly rare. His helmet is a new mold and it looks&nbsp;just stunning, though it tends to pop off sometimes. His accessory&nbsp;is a regular blaster. He does not include the cloth leg things that the others have, but if he did, then he wouldn&#39;t be able to sit.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/zb45h7ifn/DSCN3744.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 413px;"" /></p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard some people say that the neck&nbsp;brace makes his neck too long, but I think&nbsp;it looks fine.</p>

<p>The face is the &quot;angry clone&quot; (according to JangBricks) and since he has a helmet, it doesn&#39;t matter all that much to me, though I think that face is pretty cool.</p>

<h3><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/k4y3q9ser/DSCN3747.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 413px;"" /></h3>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The whole thing took me about (maybe) ten minutes to build, but it was a fun build. There&#39;s all kinds of clever building techniques used to create the angles and engines.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The speeder looks super cool and almost the same as the large one, with one exception: the big seat thingys&nbsp;that stick up on the back&nbsp;to protect the Snowtroopers&nbsp;are absent here.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4nalmklxv/DSCN3739.jpg"" style=""width: 550px; height: 413px;"" /></p>

<p>I don&#39;t see how Lego could have added it though, unless they made the whole set way bigger and then you have all kinds of other problems. The one detail doesn&#39;t bug me that much. The Trooper fits on nicely and he can operate the mounted gun. The gun can swivel side to side and up and down and it shoots a trans green stud using the ever awesome stud shooter. Also included is extra studs just in case you lose your other one,&nbsp;which is super helpful. It&#39;s so easy to lose the studs, but I just can&#39;t stop shooting it. It&#39;s so fun!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fantastic set with cool parts and the amazing&nbsp;Snowtrooper. This set is the cheapest way to get him and it&#39;s very worth it.</p>

<p>Pros: Everything!!</p>

<p>Cons: Umm...the Trooper&#39;s helmet pops off? But that&#39;s not a huge deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think Lego did a great job on the whole.</p>
