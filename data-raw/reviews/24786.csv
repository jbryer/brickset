"TK_1308","2016-01-11T12:42:36.527Z","""We're fighting a bigger fight.""","<p>Wave 3 of the Microfighters continues with The Ghost from Star Wars Rebels.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mini Microfighter box. Hera Syndulla is the figure of choice on the top. The front shows the ship flying in a battle and the back shows Hera piloting it away from an attack by companion set 75128. The bottom edges has all 6 wave 3 sets in their battle pairings.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. A nice selection of pieces and colours. There are two unnumbered bags in the box.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The kit comes with a Hera Syndulla minifigure. It&#39;s a nice representation of the character, good detailing of her flight suit on her torso and legs but nothing new if you already have 2014&#39;s 75053 The Ghost. Her head is double sided with &#39;smiling&#39; and &#39;worried&#39; faces. She comes armed with a black compact blaster pistol.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 5 minutes.&nbsp;<br />
It&#39;s quite a sturdy little ship when it&#39;s been built and the hinges designed to capture the angles of The Ghost are well done. The thruster configuration has also been designed with a little thought. Great for kids and very &#39;flyable&#39;.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice mini-version of The Ghost and measures 10 cm long, 9.5 cm wide and 4 cm tall.<br />
Hera sits dead centre of the craft and it has a forward mounted tile based stud shooter with 4 light green disc blasts to see off any TIE Fighters.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Love them or hate them, Microfighters continue to be a part of the yearly line up. Personally, I think they make great desk mascots and it&#39;s also a good way to get some nice minifigures.<br />
This was a must have for me as it has my favourite character from the show and makes a good companion piece to any of the other 3 Rebels Microfighters which have been released in 2015.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2021-01-23T06:38:15.397Z","A great alternative to the larger set","<p>So I&#39;ve been wanting to get <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75053-1/The-Ghost"">75053</a>&nbsp;for a long time, but I just can&#39;t bring myself to spend $200 on a set that is incomplete and only cost $90 when it was new. I managed to find a few affordable Rebels minifigures over the last few years, one of which was Hera, so I figured so long as it looks like I&#39;ll never get the big set, maybe I should get the microfighter. Of course, this set is also outrageously overpriced on the second hand market, but its parts are all very common so I thought why not piece it together on Bricklink, which I did, and even got the instructions. Not counting Hera, it set me back less than $10.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hera Syndulla&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hera is the one and only minifigure, but she looks great. Her lekku uses the same mold as other twileks have had, but are green with printed detail and look very accurate. Her torso and leg prints also look great. I really couldn&#39;t ask for anything better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ghost</p>

<p>Obviously as a microfighter, the Ghost is more of a toy than a Lego model, yet Lego did a phenomenal job capturing the appearance of the ship. Most impressive is how they captured all 4 of the ships engines at such a small scale. They also did a great job on the angles of the ship. The stud shooter on the top of course isn&#39;t accurate, but actually looks quite good when you have Hera sitting behind it, although you could easily just remove it if you wanted a more accurate looking ship. The colors and decorations on the ship also look great. The yellow curved bricks on top in the back make it a little ambiguous as to whether or not the Phantom is docked there, but you can kind of picture it either way which makes this set that much better.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>Certainly this is no replacement for the larger model, but it is a very satisfying little set that will at least allow you to own a ship that was the basis of the Rebels show. Of course it would make a great toy for kids, but AFOLs will enjoy having this set a lot more than having to shell out a few hundred dollars for the big one.&nbsp;</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-27T21:02:27.823Z","Phoenix Leader reporting in!","<p>The Microfighters series are a nice little pocket money alternative to the larger Lego kits, and this one certainly delivers on that front. If you (or your kid) is a fan of Star Wars: Rebels, then the out-of-production large scale Ghost model will set you back &pound;100&#39;s. For around &pound;7, the Microfighter Ghost is a nice addition to a collection/toybox without breaking the bank.<br />
<br />
Being such a small set the construction time is very short - taking me just under 15 minutes to build - and void of any overly complicated stages. The whole thing goes together nicely, and stays together as a sturdy model once complete. There aren&#39;t many moving parts on the ship, but it does include a forward-firing laser cannon, so you can have hours of fun firing tiny green Lego circles across your living room.<br />
Obviously being a small model, the Ghost is comprised almost entirely of small pieces, so younger fans would be advised to have a tray or something similar to prevent pieces being lost during construction! That said, the set does include spares of the smallest components, so even if something does get lost then it shouldn&#39;t be the end of the world.<br />
<br />
Of course the Ghost wouldn&#39;t be complete without her captain, Hera Syndulla, and if you&#39;re a collector this will be the main reason for buying this set. She&#39;s nicely detailed, and comes with two different facial expressions for the appropriate situations!<br />
<br />
In summary, it&#39;s a quick and easy build, a nice cheap alternative to the full-sized Ghost, and the cheapest way to get your hands on a Star Wars: Rebels minifigure.</p>
