"TK_1308","2016-01-11T12:57:52.713Z","""Shoot down that Rebel ship.""","<p>Wave 3 of the Microfighters continues with the Sienar Fleet Systems TIE Advanced Prototype fighter from Star Wars Rebels.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mini Microfighter box. An Imperial TIE Fighter Pilot is the figure of choice on the top. The front shows the ship flying in a battle and the back shows the TIE Pilot evading incoming fire by companion set 75127. The bottom edges has all 6 wave 3 sets in their battle pairings.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. Not much colour in the set, mainly grey and black. There are two unnumbered bags in the box.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The kit comes with an Imperial TIE Fighter Pilot minifigure. This is nothing out of the ordinary and has been released in numerous kits. He has the standard &#39;angry clone&#39; head under the lid and comes armed with a black compact blaster pistol. Besides, you can never have enough Imperial troops.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 5 minutes.&nbsp;<br />
It&#39;s a sturdy little ship when it&#39;s been built and the double set hinges on the wings make sure they stay in whatever position you like. Great for kids and very &#39;flyable&#39;.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice mini-version of the TIE Advanced Prototype fighter and measures 5.5 cm long, 9.5 cm wide and about 7.5 cm tall with the wings in flight configuration. The design nicely captures the look of the craft in small scale.<br />
The pilot sits in the centre top of the craft and there are two round tipped flick missiles in the lower hull.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Love them or hate them, Microfighters continue to be a part of the yearly line up. Personally, I think they make great desk mascots and it&#39;s also a good way to get some nice minifigures.<br />
A nice, sturdy TIE Fighter and looks great on display with any of the other 3 Rebels Microfighters which have been released in 2015.</p>

"TannerTheHunter","2017-08-05T20:55:02.653Z","An impulse buy on one of the better Microfighters. ","<p>I&#39;m going to be honest, I am not a fan of the Microfighters sub-series of Star Wars. I know they&#39;re just not meant for my age, but continue to strike me as mutated mini-models for a pretty terrible price of $10 USD. That said, I was at Wal-Mart today and was craving a new set. This was on sale for $5, and since I didn&#39;t have any Imperial Pilots I decided to scoop it up.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Build &amp; Appearance:&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Like most Lego sets these days, the build manages to make something pretty small out of a fair amount of parts. Utilizing its 93 elements, the Tie Advanced Prototype is only about 2 inches high and 2.5 inches wide (I don&#39;t have ruler on me at the moment so pardon my guestimates if they are a little over.) The model can stand on its own without looking too ridiciulous as a mini-model without the mini-figure inserted, much moreso than many of the other Microfighters. Place the minifigure in it and.... well, it&#39;s a matter of taste I suppose. But I just hate how it looks that way. There&#39;s also a hinge element in the back of the ship that makes no sense to me. Please, someone tell me what that is utilized for. Because honestly it looks very out of place and definitely nothing like back thrusters or something.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><br />
Mini-figure&nbsp;&amp; Parts:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Probably the chief reason I bought this was Imperial Pilot, and the for the most part he doesn&#39;t disappoint. The print on the helmet is practically perfect and incredibly detailed, and the chest back do their job as well. The face is a bit genereic but it&#39;s not supposed to stand out, it&#39;s a basic soldier head that isn&#39;t really supposed to be seen. However the back of the helmet is left pretty high up in the back, revealing nearly half the back of the head. In deep space in ship that requires a breathing apparatus, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s exactly a&nbsp;&#39;good&#39; thing.<br />
As far as rare parts go, it&#39;s always great to have useful hinges and the short blaster pistol. The side circular&nbsp;plates are printed and are a cool extra detail. The printed canopy is just a beautiful piece that I was was used more often. The colors are pretty standard for Star Wars however, a lot of gray and black. What else is new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final Opinion:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>I picked this up for 50% off its retail, and it&#39;s mostly worth that. If it&#39;s still hanging at $10 USD, probably don&#39;t bother. It&#39;s just far too overpriced like all of the Microfighters, I can&#39;t believe what sufficed as a 10 dollar set just 10 years ago compared to this. However, discounted, the figure is nice and there&#39;s a few nice parts scattered around. By itself it&#39;s still one of the better MicroFighters. I hope you enjoyed this review some, I don&#39;t get the time to review much but felt the urge to do it here.&nbsp;<br />

Godbless and happy building.&nbsp;</p>

"spritzey","2021-03-23T15:58:13.99Z","My review of 75128-1","<p>&nbsp;This micro fighter&nbsp;is a decent micro fighter,but the build was very repetitive.I did like the minifigure&rsquo;s headgear.The set itself isn&rsquo;t very large,and is easy to grip in your hand.there is a hinge part on the back which could be used to hang the build from the ceiling</p>

<p>All things considered,it isn&rsquo;t a bad build,and it would be very useful if you are making a Star Wars diorama.If however you are not,it isn&rsquo;t worth getting.</p>
