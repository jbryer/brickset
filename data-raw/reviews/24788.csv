"TK_1308","2016-01-11T13:33:17.14Z","""I'd write something in Wookiee but I'm sure it wouldn't translate.""","<p>Wave 3 of the Microfighters continues with the Wookiee Gunship from Star Wars Rebels.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mini Microfighter box. A&nbsp;wookiee Warrior is the figure of choice on the top. The front shows the ship flying in a battle and the back shows the Gunship knocking over companion set 75130. The bottom edges has all 6 wave 3 sets in their battle pairings.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. Not much colour in the set, mainly grey and sand. There are two unnumbered bags in the box.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The kit comes with a Wookiee Warrior. The figure has a little detailing on the face and also some on the legs as well. Always nice to have some more Wookiees for dioramas. He comes armed with a bowcaster.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 5 minutes.<br />
A good, solid craft when built. The cockpit area with side panel construction is somewhat reminiscent of 2014&#39;s 75028 Clone Turbo Tank. The click hinges make sure the wings stay in whatever position you want.&nbsp;<br />
Great for kids and very &#39;flyable&#39;.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice mini-version of the Wookiee Gunship and measures 9.0 cm long, 9.5 cm wide (with wings in standard flight configuration and 6.0 cm tall. The design nicely captures the look of the craft in small scale.<br />
The pilot sits in a more forward position that other Microfighters and there are some nice details including the fold down aft ramp and the movable guns on the front. There are two green tipped flick missiles for the wing mounted missile launchers.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Love them or hate them, Microfighters continue to be a part of the yearly line up. Personally, I think they make great desk mascots and it&#39;s also a good way to get some nice minifigures.<br />
A great little ship, more heavily armed than most in this range, and looks great with the other sets released in 2015.</p>

"FowlerBricks","2018-05-05T01:26:52.15Z","Graagghh Grugh Grablah! (Wookie Gunship Microfighter Review)","<p>It&#39;s been awhile since my review of the First Order Snowspeeder Microfighter and as I&#39;ve had this set for almost two years now I thought it was about time for a review.</p>

<p><br />
THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS<br />
Nothing too exciting here. Just the typical Microfighters design. The wookie does look like a dark brown wookie, like Tarrful, but in reality he&#39;s really not. He&#39;s just regular brown, so that is somewhat misleading. There&#39;s also the time honored &quot;Small parts and small ball&quot; warning which still makes no sense to me.</p>

<p><br />
THE PARTS<br />
Perfect timing! Let&#39;s go through the parts and see if there&#39;s a small ball. Hmm...well, we&#39;ve got some tan 1x2 slopes, 2x2 gray domes, 2x2 conical droid heads (unprinted), a few 1x2 brown vents, two 1x1 trans-bright green cones, some silver studs, a gray fin, etc, etc. No balls though. I mean, you could combine the gray domes into a funny oblong ball, but that&#39;s the closest you&#39;ll get. This set does have a good selection of parts even though there is no small ball.</p>

<p><br />
THE BUILD<br />
For a Microfighter, the build is fairly complex, using studs-on-the-side construction to make the window and sides. Still, it goes together quickly and easily and even younger kids should be able to figure it out.</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGURE<br />
There is also one minifigure included in this set and it is a generic wookie, if the term generic can be applied to a wookie.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/oebp8cd4j/Wookie.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/cp7pk6btf/Wookie-_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>In the large wookie gunship set, I believe the generic wookies got arm printing. No so for this guy, unfortunately. His legs have some fur printing that looks pretty nice. The wookie&#39;s torso is plain brown, which is great for mono-fig collectors. This wookie is 1/3 mono-fig, so there&#39;s a good reason to get this set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/xm3xoz7b7/Wookie-_No_Head.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>As I mentioned before, the box makes him seem dark brown and angry looking. Well...he&#39;s neither of those. He looks almost like he&#39;s smiling and the fact that mine has severely misprinted fangs helps this along.&nbsp; The rest of the printing on his head is mostly good. There lighter brown fur is excellent, but there&#39;s a bit of white at the end of his &#39;goatee&#39; fur. It doesn&#39;t look too bad, I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s there on purpose. The eyes look alright, but again, there&#39;s a tad too much white. The wookie is armed with a gunmetal gray old style crossbow which is a great piece to get, though younger kids may mistake this guy for Chewbacca.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/8sudoc3qb/Wookie-_Bowcaster.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Overall, this is a great and very massable character. It&#39;s just a shame about the misprints. Hopefully others are better. One final con: one of the hands on mine had so much friction, I could barely move it at all. I just swapped the hand out and fixed the problem, but still, that made it feel kind of cheap and sloppy.</p>

<p><br />
THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p><br />
So after the mixed bag that was the mini figure, what should we expect from the build? Well, actually, we can expect quite a bit! The gunship may be one of the best Microfighters yet. The color scheme is great, the shaping is great and accurate to the Gunship seen in Rebels.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/lk8juosw3/Gunship.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It even has the boarding ramp in the back! I mean, there&rsquo;s no space behind it, but the ramp can be raised and lowered which is a very nice touch.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/vg9mut3yb/Gunship-_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/byezeuzar/Gunship-_Back_Ramp_Lowered.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The engines on the sides can be repositioned up or down and there are some flick-missiles on the underside. These look great, but if you flick them hard enough to launch them, you are probably going to end up flicking the engine off too. That&rsquo;s a bit of a design flaw, but I can&rsquo;t readily see how to fix it. You just have to be careful when firing the missiles.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/yn46ehtk3/Gunship-_Moved_Engines.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Adding a couple of trans-bright green studs onto the back of the engines adds a nice &lsquo;drive glow&rsquo; effect so that&rsquo;s something I recommend doing if you have a couple of studs lying around.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/4v73za45v/Gunship-_Back_Drive_Glow.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The seat for the wookie is a nice padded brown with a bit of a backrest as well. The windscreen is larger than usual for a Microfighter. There are no controls but that would be nearly impossible at this scale.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/45obmzghv/Gunship-_Tilted.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/3swxgr0s3/Gunship-_Flight_Ready.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There is also no place to store the wookie&rsquo;s bowcaster, but the cockpit is spacious enough to allow him to carry it while flying. Underneath the cockpit is a pair of laser cannons that can be moved up and down. A 1x1 clip adds some more detail to the front of the ship. A small fin sits on the back behind mechanical detail built out of pearl silver 1x1 studs. The gunship is very swooshable and sturdy. When dropped from a height of two or three feet, the engine pods may come off, along with the fin but that&rsquo;s about it. So full points to Lego there. In terms of accuracy, this is about as accurate as a Microfighter can get. Yeah, there should be two windows but the wookie is sitting where the second window would be. Full points here too!</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p><br />
Microfighters may not fit some people&rsquo;s tastes and that&rsquo;s just fine. I very much enjoy these chibi-fied Star Wars vehicles and this one is no exception. It&rsquo;s an excellent chibi rendition of the gunship from Rebels, it&rsquo;s sturdy and playable and it has a good mini figure. What more can I say? I love it! Well done Lego! Just pay closer attention to the face print next time, ok?</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-05-08T09:43:37.323Z","A very nice Microfighter","<p>The Wookiees are a predominant race in the Star Wars universe. In chronological film order, they first appear in Episode 3: The Revenge of the Sith, whilst Yoda is leading a clone campaign against the leading forces of the Separatists, on the Wookiees home planet of Kashyyyk. We only see two &#39;named&#39; Wookiees in that campaign (Chewbacca and Tarful) who both help Yoda escape Kashyyyk when the Clone Commander Gree turns on Yoda and attempts to kill him. The endeavour promptly ceases when Yoda senses a disturbance, yanks out his lightsabre and lops off Gree&#39;s head. Since then, Wookiees are in every film in the Original Trilogy (Chewbacca),&nbsp;every film in the Sequel Trilogy (Chewbacca again) and also in Solo: A Star Wars Story (guess what? It&#39;s Chewbacca again!). Furthermore, Wookiees have been in almost every LEGO Star Wars video game and also appears in the newest Star Wars video game: Star Wars Fallen Order. However, there are only 6 sets which contain unnamed Wookiees and this is one of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without further ado, I shall begin my fifth picture review!</p>

<h3>Packaging/Instructions:&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set comes in a box. I no longer have the box at hand for photography purposes, but, if your desperate, Brickset has an image here:&nbsp;https://brickset.com/sets/75129-1/Wookiee-Gunship-Microfighter</p>

<p>The instructions are easy to read and follow, with no errors or mistakes. They are contained in a small booklet and consists of 38&nbsp;main steps and about 30 pages. The front cover repeats the box art and the back shows other Microfighters in the series (Series 3). It also shows that this set should be paired with 75130, which is a walker in the Star Wars Rebels design.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>The build uses a total of 84 pieces. The rarest pieces in the sets are the 2x4 sand beige plates cut of at either side to make a trapezium shape, which only appears in 3 sets; the 2x3x2 grey rudder, which appears in 21 sets; and the 1x2 sand beige plate with a slope on one side, which appears in 23 sets. There are also a few other noteworthy parts, but I would be here forever.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49866870223_87bb002709_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 79px;"" /></p>

<h3>Minifigure:</h3>

<p>75129 contains one minifigure, like the rest of the Microfighter series. The minifig is a Wookiee and officially called a &#39;Wookiee Warrior&#39;. There are four variants of the &#39;Wookiee Warrior&#39;, and this one is only just unique to the set. Here are some pictures to peruse.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49867714227_dd8979cb5f_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 109px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49866870308_cac1fd180c_o.jpg"" style=""width: 88px; height: 109px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49867405846_b91828d760_o.jpg"" style=""width: 119px; height: 109px;"" /></p>

<p>The Wookiee is armed with a traditional weapon of Kashyyyk, the crossbow. It fits nicely with the character. Wookiee minifigs&nbsp;are only comprised of 3 parts: the legs, the torso and the head mould. The head is printed with exceptional detail and makes the Wookiee a little bit taller than your average minifigure, as seen up against the TIE Fighter pilot. The chest fur is really nicely highlighted in lighter brown and the texture is really good. Some people have noticed a smudging or discolouring with the printing, but my minifigure doesn&#39;t suffer from these problems. The same head mould was used for the two Wookiee warriors from the full-scale Wookiee Gunship.&nbsp;The torso piece is plain brown because the head mould sits over the top. The fur design carries on and is printed on the legs, making a really nice and extremely strong overall minifigure.</p>

<h3>The Build:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The build is quite quick, but is a little more advanced than a polybag, so I suggest an age rating of 5 and up. The build is split into 4 parts: the frame of the body; detail on the body; the top and the wings. It takes no longer than five minutes for an inexperienced builder and does not feel overly repetitive. Despite being from Rebels, it really doesn&#39;t feel like a pitiful Rebels build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed Model:</h3>

<p>Let me roll off some pictures.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49866869863_e485e0db91_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 70px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49867714272_6b85b6e3f5_o.jpg"" style=""width: 95px; height: 70px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49867405861_f2712d99d6_o.jpg"" style=""width: 78px; height: 70px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49867714667_40c20f4dd4_o.jpg"" style=""width: 73px; height: 70px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49866869913_bd620c53c3_o.jpg"" style=""width: 90px; height: 70px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49867405581_93a9df1bc3_o.jpg"" style=""width: 86px; height: 70px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49867714232_56a73db803_o.jpg"" style=""width: 91px; height: 70px;"" /></p>

<p>As, you can see, the Wookiee is just shorter than the tallest point on the set. At the back, there is a boarding ramp and, even though there&#39;s nothing behind, this adds a nice detail. The wings are primarily made up of the engines, which look really good, except you may want to add a stud on the back to represent thrust. On the inside of the engines, there are two flick-fire missiles, which adds to a nice playability score. The wings can move up and down, although the standard position is the one furthest down. There are also two guns on the front, which can be moved up and down, with a restriction whilst it is on the ground. The bizarre use of the translucent cockpit piece really fits and looks amazing in the build. The Wookiee can sit comfortably inside the cockpit area.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Price:</h3>

<p>The UK price is &pound;8.99, which is a little bit over the 10 pence per piece rate. The US price is $9.99. Furthermore, the set could be found on minute sales, but sales nevertheless. This is one of the few Microfighters that I think is worth the price.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>I truly think this set is amazing. The level of detail for a Microfighter is incredible and the colour scheme looks amazing. This set definitely attracts kids with the playability functions and the fact that you can battle with other Microfighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifig- an exclusive&nbsp;minifigure and a cool addition for collectors and children alike. 10/10. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Build- a really relaxing and easy build that feels better than any Star Wars Rebels builds. 8/10. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability- has moving wings, flick-fire missiles and can battle against other Microfighters. 9/10. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts- some rare pieces, which are nice. Most are common, though. 7/10. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Price- a little bit on the unsure side but mostly worth it. 7/10.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this review and I&nbsp;hope it was helpful! Look out for more of my reviews soon!</p>
