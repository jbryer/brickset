<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard Small Micro Fighters box that features very nice box art on the back and front. The box showcases the Micro Fighter standing on a cliff with explosions in the background on a starry night.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not many rare or uncommon parts here. Set could be made if you have a large collection of unused gray and yellow elements. The two gray domes are however nice to have around and can be re-purposed for other builds. The price per piece is a little bit above average however it does compensate with a couple of larger sized pieces in the build.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As is the case with most Micro Fighters this set only comes with one minifigure, an imperial AT-DP pilot that is consistent with walker pilots of the Star Wars Rebels line of sets. The pilot in this&nbsp;set is the same pilot featured in the much larger Set 75083 AT-DP which comes with the larger AT-DP and two of these pilots. If you&#39;re looking to improve your collection of these pilots then this set is the most cost effective way to do so.</p>

<p>The figure features printing on both the torso and legs that compliments the overall whiteness of the suit very nicely. The helmet as well as the head feature nice printing as well that shows off the imperial logo on it while the head includes a printed on strap for the helmet. The figure also comes equipped with a small blaster pistol.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is abnormally large for a Micro Fighters set although that is to be expected of a walker. It towers over even Set 75075 AT-AT Micro Fighter which is the second tallest Micro Fighter and the only other walker based Micro Fighter in the series. This of course isn&#39;t canon as the real AT-AT towers at a staggering 22.5 meters while the AT-DP is only 11.6 meters (canonically). The actual build features some interesting building techniques with sideways plating. The egs are a pretty standard hinge build so not too much to look at there. In comparison this is definitely one of the nicer Micro Fighters and looks nice underneath the larger model.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model stands very nicely at over 2 times the size of the minifigure. The hinges and technic pins connecting the legs to the rest of the&nbsp;build allow for added movement and playability to the set. The Blaster Cannon situated at the front sticks out very far for such a small build although can be removed or replaced easily. I&#39;m not too big of a fan of all the yellow elements being exposed although that&#39;s just a minor complaint. The end model does also come with two added red studs for the blaster at the front of the vehicle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I think this is a very nice Micro Fighter and one of the nicer out of the series 3 line of Micro Fighters. I&#39;d definitely recommend it if you&#39;re looking to add to your collection of Star Wars Rebels pilots or for a micro version of the larger AT-DP. The minifigure although not exclusive, is still nice to have as well.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mini Microfighter box. An AT-DP Driver is the figure of choice on the top. The front shows the walker in a battle and the back shows it running away from companion set 75130. The bottom edges has all 6 wave 3 sets in their battle pairings.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. Not much colour in the set, mainly grey and yellow. A couple of new pieces for me, though which was nice. There are two unnumbered bags in the box.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The kit comes with an AT-DP Driver. This is the same as the one released in 2015&#39;s 75083 AT-DP and it&#39;s a nice way to build up your Imperial forces. He come armed with a black compact blaster pistol.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 5 minutes.<br />
Probably the weakest build of the 2016 Rebels Microfighter range. The cockpit area is based on the same construction techniques employed in 75129. The use of Technic pieces for the legs adds poseability.<br />
There are a couple of areas where 2 pieces have been used which could&#39;ve been replaced by a single piece and the use of yellow &#39;L&#39; plates under the side domes seems a little odd when a standard yellow 2x2 plate would&#39;ve done the job.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A fun kit but somewhat oversized for what it&#39;s supposed to be. The legs each have 3 points of articulation at the hip, knee and ankle areas which gives a lot of poseability for display.<br />
As with all 2 legged Imperial Walkers, it&#39;s most stable in the perfectly upright position.<br />
There&#39;s a forward mounted stud shooter with 4 red disc blasts. This can hinge downwards, should the driver feel like blasting the walker&#39;s legs off.&nbsp;<br />
It measures 10 cm tall, 6 cm wide (toe to toe) and 6.5 cm long (gun barrel to aft exhaust port).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Love them or hate them, Microfighters continue to be a part of the yearly line up. Personally, I think they make great desk mascots and it&#39;s also a good way to get some nice minifigures.<br />
Not the best in the current releases but worth it for two reasons. One, the minifigure. Two, the Wookiee Gunship needs something to shoot at.</p>
