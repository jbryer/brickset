"Black_Leader","2016-01-18T19:12:19.857Z","The Resistance has a Better Army than the First Order","<p>When the names for the 2016 Force Awakens Lego sets were first revealed before the movie came out, the Resistance Battle Pack was the least exciting for me. Compared with promise of the names 75139 Battle on Takodana and 75140 Resistance Troop Transporter, as well as the obvious appeal of 75132 First Order Battle Pack, this set always seemed like an afterthought to me. Now, here we are, in January 2016, and since the majority of us have been disappointed by the First Order Battle Pack and the glorified battle pack that is Battle on Takodana, the Resistance Battle Pack is looking a lot more desirable. I&#39;m going to make a bold statement and say that is one of the best battle packs the Lego Group has ever done, a throwback to classics such as 7668 Rebel Scout Speeder.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>One interesting note about the battle pack packaging for 2016 is that the boxes are now taped like regular sets. This is a welcome change, for too often I went to the store and saw the boxes that can be opened with your hands savaged and looted. Inside the box there are two bags, an instruction manual of typical battle pack size, and a loose 4x10 light bley plate.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As most everyone knows, the only reason for purchasing battle packs is to cheaply amass generic cannon fodder for some big battles. In recent years, Lego has inconsistent in meeting this criteria, with home runs like 75035 Kashyyyk Troopers being exceptions to the trend of more niche figures like 75088 Senate Commando Troopers. Thankfully, the Resistance Trooper Battle Pack delivers, offering three foot soldiers and an officer for First Order target practice. Now, if only the First Order Battle Pack succeeded in the same fashion. The officer, who the DK Visual Dictionary tells me is a lieutenant based on his rank insignia, is the only one of the four minifigures without the new helmet, instead sporting slicked back brown hair. His face has a microphone printed on it, the same one introduced in 75034 Death Star Troopers. The lieutenant&#39;s weapon is one of the horrendous stud shooters, the only one in this set without a stock added. This figure has dark brown legs and a simple but accurate tan torso that I hope to see on more Resistance officers soon. As for the other three grunts, what stands out about them is the over molding of the two piece helmets that allows for a yellow visor. These pieces look lovely and very accurate, with the chin guard flipping up just like in the movie. I&#39;m not sure what practical military purpose it serves, but hey, it looks impressive. Maybe the NFL can figure out how to do this with their helmets. Each of the soldiers carries a stud shooter with a stock attached, which still does nothing to hide the awfulness of these poor excuses for blasters. Please Lego, bring back the normal guns in the battle packs. All three of these figures wear gray pants and have a shirt with a printed vest of ammunition, though on one of the soldiers the vest in shirt are darker, adding some nice variety. The darker printed torso also appears in the Resistance Troop Transporter. This faces for the figures are all different, the best being a new head with a huge mustache that looks like Dum Dum Dugan. The other faces are Lex Luthor, which looks too angry for a good guy, and the common nondescript determined face that has already appeared on numerous members of the Resistance and First Order. I think it has replaced the smiley face as the stock expression for everything. My one gripe with these figures is that they represent a quarter of the world&#39;s population. Given that the picture of the Resistance soldier in the Visual Dictionary is African American, it&#39;s a shame that Lego couldn&#39;t diversify. I find it ironic that the Nazi-like First Order has more females and people of color represented in Lego form than the Resistance. Unless Lego is expressing some pretty radical views here, there is no reason why there can&#39;t be more diversity.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Never the focus of a battle pack, the model included is actually pretty nifty and reminds of the Rebel Scout Speeder, which is always a good thing. Though most battle packs have a non-canon vehicle, the Gian-211 speeder does appear in the film, albeit without the back turret. Other than that addition though, the speeder is very faithful to the movie, right down to the color scheme and offset laser cannons on the front.&nbsp;One of the best things about this model is that it can fit all the figures on it, something you can&#39;t always do with battle pack models. The engines are nicely detailed for their size, something overlooked often by Lego in models of this size. The turret, on the other hand, is poorly placed for a minifigure to use, but this was necessary in order to fit a pilot under it. My only major complaint with the speeder is that lack of controls for the driver. A&nbsp;control panel or control yokes&nbsp;would have gone a long way here. Should you wish to demolish the speeder, which I don&#39;t recommend, it has a fairly decent parts selection for its size. All in all, this is a vehicle I would have no qualms about dropping into a D&#39;Qar base MOC or a battle scene, something I can&#39;t say about the gun emplacement in the First Order Battle Pack.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is everything a battle pack should be. It has great generic figures that you need a fair amount of coupled with a decent vehicle. Unfortunately, Resistance Battle Pack also inspires a lot of negative emotion in me, because it&#39;s excellence increases my bitterness regarding its counterpart. To equal the amount of generic soldiers received in one of this battle pack, one has to acquire three First Order Battle Packs. Without any comparisons though, this is a fine set that you should pick up a few of, and thankfully you don&#39;t need as many as you do of the First Order Battle Pack.</p>

"Nuruodo","2016-01-22T22:33:11.153Z","Troops ready for battle!","<p>This is the first set I buy in 2016. I decided to get it because until now I didn&#39;t own any Resistance trooper, and I do like them, so for the little price it was necessary to acquire it. I&#39;m satisfied, and I think that it&#39;s a really well done Battle Pack.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is very small. It illustrates the troopers fighting along with their speeder in a forest (surely on the planet Takodana from &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;). On the back there are the soldiers facing enemies nearby the vehicle, while in the side images play features are represented. The instructions were written in a single, small book. They were easy to follow and there were no errors.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts aren&#39;t very particular. A nice brick is used under the shooter of the speeder&#39;s turret, similar to normal cameras. Most of the pieces are grey, both light and dark. Many shooters (five) are included in the set, while you&#39;ll also find rare pieces in the minifigures: in fact their helmets are fantastic. It seems possible to me (as to other people) to use them for other themes, as they appear like generic&nbsp;futuristic soldier helmets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are the base of Battle Packs. In this case we have a really nice selection of them: three Rebel troopers and a Resistance officer. Thanks to this Battle Pack you will easily start building your Resistance army (we can&#39;t say the same thing about the complementary Battle Pack, which only gives you a standard Stormtrooper and an &quot;Megablaster&quot; version one). Characters are incredibly detailed: faces are all different, with the one of the officer decorated with a mic. Also the torsos aren&#39;t all the same: in fact we find three models in this set, with two appearing to be identical, but being actually different for the shades of beige. The officer&#39;s torso remembers me a bit older Rebel officers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me very few time. You start building the speeder&#39;s base, then you proceed till the turret and the tip. It wasn&#39;t boring, but I can&#39;t say I enjoyed it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is nice and it seems very smart. Obviously you&#39;ll find it small, as I think that it&#39;s real dimensions in Lego universe should be a bit bigger. Although this, it&#39;s a nice model for a Battle Pack, and comparing it to its counterpart I surely prefer the speeder. The movable turret is basically the only play feature, but I actually didn&#39;t expect other ones.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a good set, surely worth it&#39;s little cost. It gives you nice minifigures, and it&#39;s perfect for your Resistance army. Maybe the speeder could be created a bit more interesting, but for me it&#39;s already ok. The only thing I don&#39;t like is the huge use of stud shooters. As in all recent battle packs, we find only this kind of weapon instead of classical blasters. This gets me disappointed every time, but probably many won&#39;t share my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Little cost</p>

<p>&ndash; Including a lot of troopers useful to build an army</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Only one play feature</p>

<p>&ndash; Massive use of stud shooters (as usual)</p>

<p>However, the parts selection is rather average, with an unimpressive range of shapes and colors.</p>

<p>Besides, the helmets - which are one of the highlights of the set - are interesting, but due to the wide &quot;jaw&quot; feel boxier in reality than they look on the picture.</p>

"joemmo","2016-07-29T23:46:34.603Z","A proper army builder or just some resistance for your Stormtroopers","<p>I seem to have amassed more than a few FO Stormtroopers&nbsp;so despite my ambivalence towards this pack I decided to pick one up on discount to give them some opposition - and am glad I did</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is all about the figures so I&#39;ll deal with them first. The highlight is the awesome helmet design with 2 part moulded &amp;&nbsp;printed&nbsp;helmet and visor and the hinged jaw piece, they look great. There are a mix of heads and torsos so you could easily get a few variants with the torsos having sharp prints featuring bandoliers front and back and in 2 tones of brown.</p>

<p>Legs are a little disappointingly&nbsp;just&nbsp;plain but I guess the money went into the helmets. It would have been nice, like the FO BP, to get some more variation in skin colour&nbsp;for the head, they really missed a trick there.</p>

<p>Studshooters of course... not a fan so have just swapped in some regular blasters but at least they come with an additional grip piece that makes them look more like an RPG type launcher.</p>

<h3>The build &amp; parts</h3>

<p>What makes this set even better is the 2 man speeder with turret. I don&#39;t recognise it from a film but it&#39;s certainly StarWarsy&nbsp;looking&nbsp;enough and adds a lot of play value. The build itself brings no suprises&nbsp;and is of a Microfighter type scale but goes together well. If you don&#39;t like the vehicle then it has a good range of usable parts for a MOC or mod of your own.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>At full RRP I probably wouldn&#39;t have bothered with this set but would have missed out. Even though you barely see these guys in the film, they&#39;re great to have for setting up against your First Order troops. For me, this is what a battlepack should be - a good selection of figures and a fun little vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Figures and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The draw is the minifigures and we get a great set here. The set includes 4 battle ready troopers one of whom is their officer. The detailing on these is pretty good though the best part by far is how accurate the dual molded helmet is to its film counterpart. These are all great to have! You will have lots of trans blue studs left over as spare pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Set:</strong></p>

<p>The modified Gian-211 Speeder included in the set is great! It comes with a heavy duty blaster attached and best of all, all 4 figures can ride this thing! Compared to its First Order counterpart this set seems more battle ready. The First Order better watch out!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Both are at a size which is standard for battle packs.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Normal BP build, a bit longer thanks to a few more pieces than the usual 90+ (which is good). Nothing too special.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a few interesting ones, like the 1x1 trans light blue cones and 2x2 trans orange radar dishes, but apart from those with the figures there&#39;s not much.</p>

<h3>Playability&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Playability is ok, you can slide the speeder around, shoot the stud shooters, and play with the articulated cannon that rotates and hinges up and down.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Very awesome minifigs in this set. You get 3 troopers and one officer. The troopers have very nicely detailed helmets with a clip-on neckguard. They all have different faces. The officer has reddish brown slicked-back hair, and a nicely detailed torso with rank markers. They all come with stud shooters.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This set has pretty good value, especially when compared with its companion, the First Order Battle Pack. The ppc is quite good for a battle pack.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Verdict&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A pretty awesome battle pack. One of the stronger ones this wave. If you likes The Force Awakens, you ought to get this set.</p>
