Seeing as the First Order stormtroopers are only present in the very expensive First Order Transporter (75103, a &euro;80 set for &euro;100) and I want to get a small army of stormtroopers to use as enemies in the Star Wars RPG group I run, I wanted this set right away.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I never really know what to say about LEGO boxes. It&#39;s the same basic principle every time: set on the front, along with what mini figures to expect. On the back is shown what bits can open/turn/whatever.</p>

<p>The instructions are all in a single booklet, standard pages stapled together. I think they show the steps pretty well, seems to be a nice pace per step.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s less parts in this than in the standard battle pack but it makes it up by including some bigger parts.</p>

<p>Sadly, the stud shooters make a return. I was hoping we were done with this since the First Order TIE Fighter set (75101) I bought contained normal guns again, and other sets of the new 2016 line do so as well. Seems that all the new battle packs contain stud shooters and all the others don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Personally I&#39;m mostly amazed by all the trans-red plates and studs, they&#39;ll sure come in handy someday. Sadly they&#39;re not enough to fix Kylo Ren&#39;s Command Shuttle (the windscreen of which is red in the movie, not white as in the LEGO set).</p>

<h3>Mini figures</h3>

<p>The most important part of battle packs; these mini figures do not disappoint.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Stormtroopers: These guys make or break the set. Personally, I think they look awesome. The new slick helmet designs really look like they were created specifically so the LEGO figures would look great. The torsos look very nice and there&#39;s actually two different versions; one is just white (like the two stormtroopers in 75103) and the other one is white along with a black half vest of some kind, which provides a nice diversity also present in the movie. Shame it&#39;s still basic &quot;angry clone&quot; heads but as they&#39;re hidden under helmets it&#39;s not really an issue.</li>
	<li>First Order Crew: Exact same figure as was in the TIE set (75101) and I&#39;m still not really into this figure. My opinion on them hasn&#39;t changed - a generic guy, mainly interesting for army builders and big setpiece makers. I get that the helmet is an evolution from the ones seen in the old trilogy but it just looks weird to me, it doesn&#39;t help that they&#39;re not prominently featured in the movie. For this review I&#39;ll add that it&#39;s not that weird seeing them in a battle pack - which people might think, seeing as their helmet counterparts in A New Hope were non-action button pushers and lever pullers. In the new movie, these helmets aren&#39;t really seen on people behind screens but they are seen next to stormtroopers, indicating this time around the helmets stand for some type of battle unit.</li>
	<li>First Order Sergeant: Don&#39;t know if he&#39;s actually a sergeant but until Brickset comes with the official handle I&#39;ll just refer to him as that. His body is the exact same body as the crew figure. His hat could be compared to the one from the officer in set 75101 except this one is all black and has the brim down instead of up. Just like the officer in set 75101, this is another First Order member with a head other than white (dark brown this time) and I&#39;ve got to say that it looks good. With his clothes being black, I may put his head on an officer&#39;s body and put a different head onto this body, for better contrast.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Since there&#39;s so few parts there&#39;s no real danger of repetition. The big turret that goes along with the figures in this pack is fun to put together and there&#39;s some nice small surprises in the build. Since it&#39;s a small pack, the build will be over with very soon though so if you&#39;re into an interesting build you would be better off with a bigger set. If you&#39;re into an interesting build and you&#39;ve only got about ten minutes to spare, then you&#39;ve found your set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The turret looks sweet and like something I would actually use during my Star Wars RPG group, unlike the stuff from some of the other battle packs. Looking at the completed model also makes me think this looks great as a turret tower for someone building a LEGO Death Star Trench.</p>

<p>The new stormtroopers are awesome, the sergeant is a nice variation and I personally don&#39;t really care for the crew member.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>On the whole, battle packs will be most interesting to the people who want to create armies, be it for playing, RPG, set pieces... This set will not disappoint them, it helps that this is the first cheap(ish) set with the First Order stormtroopers.</p>

<p>A downside is that the little pack is expensive for what it contains, while there&#39;s less parts in there than your average battle pack. But just like I said before, Star Wars LEGO has really gotten way too expensive recently (while not exactly being cheap before), and seeing this battle pack for the same price as the older battle packs are feels like a relief. The good you get from this set outweighs the price in my opinion, I may just get a second one. That would make this the first set I buy twice, so that&#39;s a big statement on what I think this set offers.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First Order stormtroopers in a set less expensive than &euro;100!</li>
	<li>Nice looking turret that would go great in an army or setpiece.</li>
	<li>Non-white non-alien head, still rare in LEGO Star Wars.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Normal battle pack price seems heavy for so few parts.</li>
	<li>Another crew member, could&#39;ve done with a third stormtrooper instead.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the whole, I think this is an excellent battle pack. The battle pack price may be high for a set with so few parts but having First Order stormtroopers without having to buy the &euro;100 set 75103 for two is great and the turret is, in my opinion, much better use of parts than what the average battle pack does. If you&#39;re a Star Wars fan and have need of stormtroopers, then by all means get this set right away.</p>

"PooPotato","2016-01-12T20:12:39.34Z","The Pride of the First Order","<p>Even though I loved The Force Awakens and all of the Lego sets that came with it, their price tags were absolutely abominable to my wallet. &nbsp;This had me looking towards 2016 almost immediately, as I am much more a fan of smaller $25-$40 priced sets (sets like 75087 and 75100), and it looks like the early 2016 ones will mostly be on that side. &nbsp;However, for some bizarre reason, the US will not receive any of the non-Force Awakens sets until mid-Spring. This might be a blessing in disguise so that I&#39;ll have some money saved for May 4th, but until then, I&#39;ll be reviewing the cheapest Force Awakens sets that they have to offer, which of course starts with the Battlepacks.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is a new feature of smaller boxes, or if it&#39;s been around for a while, but both sides of this box were taped shut instead of the usual punch out semi-circle. &nbsp;I have started to collect the boxes for my sets, so this is of course a huge plus, because the punch out completely destroys the box.&nbsp; The instruction booklet was of the usual size and folded cleanly in half.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>While this set only contains 72 pieces, all of them are pretty substantial.&nbsp;The turret consists of light grey slopes and plates with black highlights, all of which could be used to make buildings, bunkers, or even a bigger turret! &nbsp;Once I get a couple more of these, I plan to construct a more substantial model of a Starkiller Base turbolaser to accompany my other Force Awakens sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The main reason you buy these sets:</p>

<p><strong>First Order Stormtrooper&nbsp;</strong>is easily the star of this set. &nbsp;Everything from the printing to the helmet molding is spot on, and looks absolutely wonderful. &nbsp;He comes with the standard Clone Trooper face underneath, which is of course inaccurate, but it doesn&#39;t affect the minifigure in anyway considering the helmet is going to be on 90% of the time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>First Order Stormtrooper&nbsp;(Heavy Artillery)&nbsp;</strong>is exclusive to this set, and&nbsp;almost identical to his regular infantry cousin, apart from the&nbsp;magazine chest pouch he is wearing. &nbsp;This figure looks really cool, and I&#39;m glad that he was included.</p>

<p><strong>First Order Crew Member (Helmet)&nbsp;</strong>has now appeared in three different sets. &nbsp;Like I mentioned in&nbsp;my review on the Special Forces TIE, I have likened his helmet to a hybrid of a Death Star Gunner and a Death Star Trooper. &nbsp;While this minifigure looks cool, there really is no place to put him at the moment, so he waits for a Starkiller Base set...</p>

<p><strong>First Order Crew Member&nbsp;</strong><strong>(Hat)</strong>&nbsp;is exclusive to this set, and looks pretty good. &nbsp;He has the same torso and legs as the other First Order Crew Member, but he comes with a printed hat. The hat isn&#39;t of the same glossy black that the helmet is, but is more of a matte black. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As for any 72 part build, there weren&#39;t any life-changing techniques used. &nbsp;Play functions were implemented quite well, and the base of the turret looks pretty good as well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While the model does look somewhat familiar to the turbolasers seen in the movie, I would have much rather seen a small utility vehicle or speeder that the minifigures could interact with. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t look bad, but when compared to 75131&#39;s model, it doesn&#39;t impress all that much.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While I love the minifigures in this set, I think that this set suffers from the same drawbacks as 75000 Clone Troopers vs. Droidekas. &nbsp;While we got two Clone Troopers with that set, one was a &nbsp;standard Infantryman while the other was a Sergeant. &nbsp;Since the First Order Crew Member (Helmet) is already included in 3 sets, and literally has nowhere to go in a collection at the moment, I think that it would have been wiser to replace him with another regular First Order Stormtrooper. &nbsp;Two unique figures with two highly desirable identical figures seems to be&nbsp;the golden rule for a successful Battlepack, and this set doesn&#39;t follow that rule at all. That&#39;s not to say that this is a terrible Battlepack though. &nbsp;You do get 4 different minifigures and a well built model for $13. &nbsp;So while it may not be what we all wanted, it&#39;s still a set worth of multiple purchases, and I plan on getting a few more to fill out my First Order ranks.</p>

"joemmo","2016-01-19T20:04:35.427Z","One figure short of awesome","<p>A good way to get some new Stormtroopers but not without compromise.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard Battle Pack sized box with the figures and turret on action on the front. Instructions are a small leaflet as there&#39;s not a lot to build,&nbsp;as you&#39;d expect.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The non-minifig component of this set is a miniature defence&nbsp;turret but it&nbsp;offers a few interesting pieces, particularly the tall 2x2 corner slopes and 3x3 plate which I can&#39;t recall owning before. There&#39;s a couple of wedge plates and some trans red plays and grilles plus a printed 2x2 control panel tile. You also get a decent stash of the less common bright green 1 stud round plates for laser ammo.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The officer and crew figures are just fine but really this needs just one of them and 3 stormtroopers. Still, that&#39;s what Lego have provided and that&#39;s what we&#39;ll buy.</p>

<p>I do really like the fact that, at last, there are some non-white faces appearing in these sets - maybe Lego could go crazy and even put some female faces under the helmets now that we know the First Order is an equal opportunity tyrannical employer.</p>

<p>You get four stud shooters, as is the norm but I replaced these straight away with the mini-weapons and built a TR8R style baton for one of the troopers to wield.</p>

<p>The troopers themselves are great of course, the printing is crisp and detailed&nbsp;but the helmets are absolutely spot on. Good job by the modellers there.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The turret is simple but looks good, it&#39;s a fun little build and has some real play value for a few parts.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Think of this being on a&nbsp;micro scale Starkiller Base and you&#39;re on the right track. You could even get a couple of these, fix them to a plate, add&nbsp;a little bit of MOCing give something for your X-Wing Microfighters to bombard.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Like everyone else I&#39;d prefer another Stormtrooper but that aside this is still a decent set and the turret is more than just a token gesture. I might even grab&nbsp;another and build a tiny rally scene...</p>

"Nuruodo","2016-02-01T20:28:31.06Z","Let's build an army... or no?","<p>I bought this set because the first 2016 isn&#39;t very attractive, and so I decided to get &nbsp;all Battle Packs to increase my minifigures collections. I have already known that this set only cotains&nbsp;one First Order &quot;standard&quot; Stormtrooper, but I decided to buy it anyway, although crew members are pretty uneseful.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is very small. It has a picture of the turrets surrounded by First Order troopers on a snowy battleground (Starkiller Base) being bombed by something. On the rear, play features are shown as usual, while an image very similar to the front let us see the trooper returning fire. The instructions are all written in one thin&nbsp;book.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are divided in a bigger-bricks bag and a smaller-bricks bag. There are no particular parts, except four normal stood shooters and a 2x1 brick mounted one. They are all black, light grey and dark grey colored.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are what makes people buy this set. You&#39;ll find: a Stormtrooper, a &quot;Megablaster&quot; Stormtrooper and two Crew Members, all from First Order. The first one is the most important figure, because it&#39;s the standard army unit: he is very similar to movie, with the fantastic helmet very well represented. The &quot;Megablaster&quot; trooper, or Heavy Artillery trooper, has his torso different from the standard Stormtrooper, but except this detail he is identical. The crew members are of two different types: the one with open helmet and brown skin and the one with closed and very strange helmet (I also found it in the Special Forces TIE Fighter). These crew members aren&#39;t very interesting, but I like their designs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very fast, less than 10 minutes, as I expected. I found no difficulties, but I enjoyed it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The turret is nice, I like it. It&#39;s very small and simple, but however It fits it&#39;s role of siding minifigures in a Battle Pack. Lego managed to insert some play features, both in the cannon and in the base. I&#39;m disappointed by the weapon only made by a stud shooter, but I didn&#39;t expect something different, I admit it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A nice Battle Pack, that looses a bit of value due to the presence of only one standard Stormtrooper. Its little price however is very appealing, and everything new and featured in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; is very attractive to me like to other people. Anyway Lego could do something different, maybe inserting a more loyal to original model turret or a different model, like a small vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Little price</p>

<p>&ndash; Presence of First Order Stormtroopers, pretty difficult to find</p>

<p>&ndash; Nice turret</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Model not very&nbsp;accurate</p>

<p>&ndash; Only one standard Stormtrooper included</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box of the set has a detailed picture on the front. The back shows the weapons&nbsp;in the set (which I really like.) The instructions are easy to read.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts for this set are good. Personally I don&#39;t care about the turret, I just want the minifigures.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>If your getting one of the set, then the minifigures are good, however if you want to get multiple then it is average. I would like to get one more stormtrooper in this set and then it would be great for army building. The stormtroopers have good detailing along with the other guys.

"VaderFan2187","2016-10-27T22:08:08.007Z","It's the First Order... they're here!","<p>Battle Packs are usually meant to be bought multiples of, so you can build your own army. Bear that in mind as we dive into the set...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Just your usual battle pack sized box and instructions.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>Nothing particularly special here either. You build the main base and then build the top rotating turret.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set seems a little lacking in parts as well. Perhaps the only thing I find is cool (minifigs notwithstanding) are the 1x2 trans red plates.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Playability is alright. The turret rotates and the stud shooter on top fires. You can fold out two panels: One to access controls, the other to access extra ammo. Beware, however, because if you fold them in too much, they are extremely tricky to reopen.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I&#39;m sure many of us buy battle packs for the minifigures. As I said earlier, Battle Packs are usually bought multiples of to build armies.</p>

<p><strong>First Order Crew (open hat):</strong> This guy is okay. I like his simple printing on his torso, and I&#39;m glad LEGO is seeking more diversity by putting a person of color in these latest Star Wars sets.</p>

<p><strong>First Order Crew (closed helmet):</strong> Same as with Kylo Ren&#39;s shuttle and FO TIE Fighter, just with a stud shooter. He uses the new generic head (used on the Resistance trooper from the FO Transporter and also used on the Rebel from U-wing Starfighter). His body and legs are the same as the other crewmember.</p>

<p><strong>First Order Heavy Stormtrooper:</strong> He has nice printing on his torso, but the rest of him is the same as regular stormtroopers. Uses an angry clone head. I wish they had modified his blaster to make it bigger, however.</p>

<p><strong>First Order Stormtrooper:</strong> Not much to say here, just your regular FO Stormtrooper. I actually prefer the helmet mold to those of the Classic Stormtrooper molds.</p>

<p>However, the problem is that, as only one regular stormie is included, this isn&#39;t really an army building set. If you buy, say, 5 of this set, you will end up with 10 crewmembers, 5 Heavy Stormies, and only 5 Regular Stormtroopers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The value, sadly, isn&#39;t there either, due to the inclusion of only 88 pieces, compared to the Resistance BP, which has over 110 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>It&#39;s an okay set. Not one you want to buy too many for army-building, however. The turret is lacklustre, and only one regular stormtrooper is included as opposed to two cremembers. Do get it if you&#39;re a First Order fan and have a low budget, but otherwise, it&#39;s missable.</p>

The design of the cannon is very reminiscent of a weapons tower you&rsquo;d expect to see on the Death Star, or perhaps Starkiller Base, only reduced in size and scale to better fit in for playability. I feel this build could have benefited slightly more from including a spot that Minifigures could interact with the cannon on top. I&rsquo;ll explain more about that in a moment in the complete model section.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s the sort of build you&rsquo;d expect to find in a set designed for playing more than making models that are to scale. On top of that this is the perfect scale to represent a small weapon tower with the Microfighters.</span></span></span></span></p>

This is a brilliant design choice for this type of weapon, more often than not I find myself attaching the spares for these weapons someone under the model or in a spot that doesn&rsquo;t stand out too badly.

"Ephseb","2017-10-13T20:29:11.17Z","Not really serving the purpose of a Battlepack..","<p>I found one of these at a local supermarket today - at a discount of 65% - which prompted me to write a quick review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience:</p>

<p>Not much to say here, it&#39;s a small model and it shouldn&#39;t take more than 3-4 minutes to build. It provides no outstanding techniques or functions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Though there aren&#39;t a lot of them, there are some rare and very useful parts in this set: most notably the light grey 3x3 plate, the 4 flat corner tiles and the 4 side parts of the tower. It&#39;s always nice to get some dark-skinned heads, and I quite like that officer&#39;s cap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>The turret is a downscaled version of the larger Heavy Turbolasers seen during the assembly on Starkiller Base. It can be opened on two opposing sides to store studs for the blasters or access the control panel. The top can turn around 360&deg; and fire another stud from its cannon, which is able to swerve up or down to fire at figures or vehicles. It probably won&#39;t take down any airspeeders, fighters or bombers though..</p>

<p>If you have other TFA sets, it&#39;s a great collection of different enemies for your &quot;Resistance&quot; heroes, but that&#39;s also a major flaw. In a Battlepack - of which you buy multiples of to build up your army - there should be more than one of the respective faction&#39;s mainline infantry soldier. In this pack, there&#39;s only one regular FO Stormtrooper. I don&#39;t know if children would care though. The figures are a nice addition to those in the FO Transport, Kylo&#39;s shuttle or the TIE Fighter either way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>Speaking of figures, this pack includes one FO Stormtrooper, one FO Navy trooper / Gunner / &quot;crew&quot;, one FO Heavy Trooper with ammo pouches on the front of his torso, and one FO officer with a new cap. The first two previously appeared in 75103 FO Transport (FOST), 75104 Kylo&#39;s Shuttle (FOST &amp; Gunner) and 75101 TIE Fighter (Gunner). More FOSTs appeared in the 75139 Takodana set. The Heavy Trooper was later released as a polybag with a slightly updated torso print, and appeared in the 75178 &quot;Quadjumper&quot; starship set. The only one that remained exclusive to this set is the dark-skinned officer - or, more accurately, only his hat / cap. Torso, legs and head are identical to one of the Gunners / crewmembers in Kylo&#39;s shuttle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for Money / Price:</p>

<p>At 16,99&euro;, the Battlepacks from 2014 to 2016 were criminally overpriced. I&#39;m glad they went down with the prices in 2017 and hope it stays that way. This set is similar to the others in its year: not a lot of pieces for too high a price. I was lucky to find one for &euro;10 when it first came out and one for only 4,80&euro; today, after using a 20% voucher (It would&#39;ve been 6&euro; before that).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion:</p>

<p>While it was the only FO BP at the time of its release, you have a much better alternative since June 2017: 75166 &quot;First Order Transport Speeder Battle Pack&quot; is more useful as an army builder and has a bigger variety of weapons and equipment. If you really want this one, you should look for a discount - it&#39;s not worth the RRP, not to mention any more than that.</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2016-12-26T03:44:58.72Z","A small yet deadly turrent","<p>Merry Christmas all and welcome to another review written by me. To be honest, I was very lucky to get a Lego set at all and thankfully my brother got me one. Anyways, let&#39;s dive into the review</p>

<p><b>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</b>Pretty typical of a box this size and of the same theme. Have the product on the front and action features on the back. Instructions are very clear and easy to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong>To be honest, this isn&#39;t exacly a treasure&nbsp;trove for a parts pack. Most of the pieces are very typical. I say the ones that stuck out to me the most were the pieces on the four corners, the control panel and of course the minifigure parts (I&#39;ll get to that soon)</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>For me, battlepacks&nbsp;have good minifigures, but the builds are normally poor. I like the helmets of the crew member and the officer guy. The stormtroopers aren&#39;t something special, except for their prints. &nbsp;The highlight minifigures are the ones I mentioned above, as they have unique torso prints , faces and awesome helmets.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>Build is pretty simple. Got mine done in a matter of minutes. A six year old could probably figure it out.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The model actually for once looks nice. The models are usually the weakest part of these kind of sets, however this on pleasantly surprised me, as you get a turrent&nbsp;perched on starkiller base. The features are pretty simple, asall there is is flaps to open and a stud shooter to represent the laser cannon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall: &nbsp;</strong>Battlepacks are usually a hit or miss, as either the minifigures or the build is good. However, this comes fifty fifty, as it has a decent selection of minifigures&nbsp;and a nice build. It&#39;s so nice, that I&#39;m including it in my poor M.O.C representation of the Battle of Scarif&nbsp;(in a weird imagination). I&#39;d totally recommend the set as a gift or just for fun.</p>

<p>cya soon</p>

"jLOfromTACOMA","2017-03-04T21:37:56.157Z","Glorified microfighter posing as a battlepack","<p>Like the others here, I was a bit disappointed with the actual build section of the set. You&#39;re really paying for the minifigs, and it&#39;s worth it if you need more imperial troops, but as a set I wish they had at least done as well as they did with the Resistance battle pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AGAIN: The value here is minifigs, don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to build something spectacular, unless you use the parts for MOCs.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T21:24:54.657Z","A Terrible Battlepack","<p>There is not one minifigure that is the same in this battlepack. That is a problem, in order to build an army we must have lots of the same figure. The build in this is good and it has pieces in it that are actually good for building a base with. The First Order Officer and First Order Gunner figures are terrible and should have been replaced with regular First Order Stormtroopers. I highly recommend not buying this because it is pretty terrible.</p>
",TRUE,2,4,3,4,2
"Slobrojoe","2020-01-05T20:22:17.807Z","The best battle pack yet?...","<p>This set is one of the many battle packs that have been released after the original 6 Star Wars movies (including 3 rebel packs, 4 imperial or first order and a mandalorian).</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Battle packs are renowned for their brilliant, even unique, characters. This is not an exception. This one boasts a First Order officer with a slanted cap bearing the symbol of the First Order. The torso is printed on both sides and is different to the imperial officers in previous sets. The next officer has an unusual black helmet that comes up at a point. He features the same double-sided torso but has a peculiar face. The same face is used in the rebel battle pack 75131 resistance troopers. The storm troopers have elegant helmets like in the film and the first has the usual uniform. However, the second has a black pack, presumably a heavy stormtrooper. These are rarely seen in the sequel movies and, in my opinion, would be better replaced by a regular outfit. All the minifigs&nbsp;are equipped with new stud shooter blasters which are a terrible let down. Normal blasters would be better and more relevant to the film</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>As with all battle packs, the build is quite simple. The tower&#39;s pieces consist of mainly dark and light grey, with a few blacks thrown in here and there. The top part of the tower rotates 360 degrees and the cannon itself can be moved slightly up or down. If you lift one of the flaps down, a control pad appears and on the other side is spare ammo (for both the cannon and the blasters).</p>

<p>pros:</p>

<p>-New officer hat</p>

<p>-Rotating cannon</p>

<p>-No stickers</p>

<p>-New helmet</p>

<p>cons:</p>

<p>-Non-relevant heavy stormtrooper</p>

<p>-Stud shooting blasters</p>

<p>-Bizarre face</p>

<p>Despite a few powerful cons, the pros overrule them and the battle pack is one of the best. But is it the best Battle pack yet?</p>
