"Alkuzar","2015-12-27T11:21:10.353Z","Nice set for collectors of Minifigures and fans of Star Wars Battlefront","<p>Reason i got interested in this set, is because it&#39;s based on Star Wars Battlefront. So it will look good with my other Star Wars LEGO sets based on games.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box looks good and gives you like all LEGO sets a good idea what is in the box and on the back you also see some nice alternative builds.</p>

<p>Not much to say about the instructions, they are plain and simple. So&nbsp;easy to understand for all ages.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with all LEGO Battle&nbsp;packs, it does not have a lot of parts. But there are many small parts, so be careful with younger children when building this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only parts i dislike from this set are the stud&nbsp;shooters, i have never been a fan of these since LEGO started making them. I rather would have that they put in the old style blasters.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is the best part of the set for me personal and a lot of other collectors. The Shock Trooper looks amazing with the red/white armor. It is really well done compared to the ingame version of the Shock Trooper. Same can be said of the two Stormtroopers with the battle&nbsp;damage and jump&nbsp;pack.</p>

<p>The Imperial Technician does not belong in this set, as he is not part of Star Wars Battlefront. I would rather have seen a second Shock Trooper or a different version of Stormtrooper. As they have Snowtroopers, Sandtroopers, Scout troopers, Magma Troopers and Shadow Troopers in the game.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself also does not belong in this set, as there is nothing in the game that resembles this. It would have been better in they put in a Turbo&nbsp;laser as seen on the Sullust map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For people who have not played the game, i could not find an image of the correct turret. But it looks the same as the turret below only then with one barrel.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.scifi-meshes.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=81161&amp;d=1272212360"" style=""width: 602px; height: 594px;"" /></p>

<p>I can understand why they did not add this as a build, because 75132-1 First Order Battle Pack has a similair&nbsp;build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Because this is a battle&nbsp;pack the completed model is not much to look at, but like i said above i do not think this build fits with the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Even though the build itself and the Imperial Technician are not based on anything in the Battlefront game. I do like this set for being based on the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because of this i do think the set is worth getting for people who like the game and for people who collect Minifigures&nbsp;as they are all very good looking.</p>

<p>So all in all, i think this set is worth getting it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard size battlepack box with a nice action image on the front. The back details the weaponry available to the troopers, a &#39;holo tech spec&#39; of the I.S.P. and pictures demonstrating the stud shooters and the missile launcher.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a battle pack and nice to have more maroon pieces.<br />
The updated Mitrinomon jet packs have extended thrusters which are capped by clear discs and have a patterned tile in the back. I rather like this design.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The highlight of the set and really what you&#39;re buying this set for.<br />
You get an Imperial Officer who is wearing fatigues similar to that of an AT-ST Driver and the standard &#39;comm unit on right side&#39; printed head.<br />
The Shocktrooper Stormtrooper is rather nice, with vibrant red detailing and the standard &#39;angry clone&#39; head under the lid.<br />
Finally we have 2 standard infantry Stormtroopers. Both are equipped with jet packs, stud firing rifles and nicely detailed armour with some good detailing with regards to battle damage sustained in skirmishes with Rebel forces. They also have the standard &#39;angry clone&#39; head.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As usual, a 5 minute battlepack build. Fun for army building and nothing we haven&#39;t seen before so very straightforward.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Infantry Support Platform (I.S.P.) Is a rather unusual vehicle. That said, most I.S.P.s are a little strange.&nbsp;The forward position is armed with the crew&#39;s stud shooters on the front. The upper aft position has moveable control panels to each side which hinge outwards a little.<br />
The gun turret can be detached and has a clip hinge joint for stability and a range of firing arcs. It can also rotate 360 degrees. It has one stationary laser and one spring loaded missile launcher with a red missile.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A nice battlepack and one for the army builders out there. I&#39;m not a fan of the stud shooters and with they would just make Star Wars style weapons for them to hold instead. The I.S.P. is pretty much a &#39;take it or leave it&#39; vehicle but the figures are definitely what make this set worth it.</p>

"PooPotato","2016-03-27T20:25:39.26Z","Cue the Imperial March!","<p>After waiting years and years for a proper Stormtrooper battlepack to be released, I was thrilled to find out that Lego would be producing two battlepacks based on the EA First-person-shooter Star Wars Battlefront. &nbsp;As a kid, I was in love with the first two Battlefront games, and always wished that Lego would make sets based on my favorite sets and troops. While the new Battlefront is nowhere near as addicting or fun as the originals (I&#39;ll go into further depth near the end), it is great to see proper, completely canon Stormtrooper minifigures.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box was pretty tough, but as is the norm with smaller sets, had a punch-out on it. &nbsp;The instruction booklet was folded in half, which is to be expected with battlepack instruction booklets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part selection is not particularly interesting, and I wouldn&#39;t really recommend purchasing this set for part scrapping. &nbsp;I&#39;m not going to go into too much detail on this, as the minifigures is where the meat of the review is going to be.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Two Stormtroopers&nbsp;</strong>are included with this battlepack. &nbsp;They come with battle scarred and pocked armor, along with lovely printed legs and jump-packs. &nbsp;I&#39;m somewhat indifferent to the jump-packs, probably because I absolutely despise them in the game itself, but they still look pretty good.&nbsp;Considering that a large majority of my Stormtrooper army was formed back before 2010, it&#39;s safe to say that these are the best and most accurate looking Stormtrooper minifigures that I own. &nbsp;They of course came with the standard spring stud shooter which I promptly discarded.</p>

<p><strong>Shock Trooper&nbsp;</strong>is probably one of the most feared AI you can face while playing the survival missions in Battlefront. &nbsp;He is a heavily armed, juggernaut of a soldier, and can take dozens of shots without being harmed. &nbsp;He looks very similar to the Clone Shock Trooper with his red markings. &nbsp;Once again, this figure looks outstanding, and definitely fits in with the rest of my Stormtrooper ranks. &nbsp;While he may not appear in any of the original films, the game is considered canon (according to Disney), so I have no problem having these guys wandering my Death Star.</p>

<p><b>Imperial Officer&nbsp;</b>is definitely the weak link to this battlepack. &nbsp;He is still well printed, and the new hat looks great, but he is most likely doomed to sit in the Death Star control room for the rest of his days. &nbsp;It should be noted that his head is the exact same one used in the Resistance Battlepack for the Resistance Officer. &nbsp;Is it possible that this is the same guy, and that after the Empire fell, he went and joined the Resistance?</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was unremarkable, and honestly, I am not too impressed with many of the battlepack builds.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model isn&#39;t particularly exciting by any means. &nbsp;It consists of a main platform with a control center, and a second platform with a turret connected to it, which is very similar to the turret on 75091 Flash Speeder.&nbsp;While I can&#39;t expect too much from a battlepack model, the speederbike that comes with the Rebel Alliance battlepack completely blows this one out of the water, so it&#39;s flaws are slightly more evident. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I am very pleased that Lego decided to follow the golden battlepack rule for this set (2 highly desirable, collectable&nbsp;minifigures, followed by 2 unique minifigures). &nbsp;It has been such a long time since the last proper Stormtrooper battlepack, so even if the model included is below satisfactory, I still have to give this set a 5/5 for the incredible minifigures.</p>

"TommyMacaroni","2016-02-21T16:54:02.397Z","Better late than never!","<p>I was really excited to hear about this battleback, especially since it was based off Battlefront. We haven&#39;t got a normal imperial battleback&nbsp;for ages (I am not counting rebels one, because who uses those Stormtroopers?), so it is amazing to get an easy way to get these figures &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A nice box displaying the set in action on Jakku. Normal instructions for a set this size.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You get some nice dark red pieces included, including some slopes, which are only in two other sets. There are also&nbsp;two white jumpacks, which are exclusive.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has four brilliant figures, which I will cover separately.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The two Stormtroopers are extremely similar to the ones in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75055-1/Imperial-Star-Destroyer"">75055</a>&nbsp;and later, but with battle damage on the torso and helmet. While this detail is nice, it does limit display value, as lined up armies&nbsp;would likely have more clean uniform. However, this is a nice change, as battle scenes will benefit from this detail. Two jumpacks are also included, which can easily be removed. They work well with most other imperial (and other) troops.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Shocktrooper has been seen as a clone before, but this is it&#39;s first time as an imperial troop. This printing is amazing, and it should be a&nbsp;welcome addition to all imperial army dioramas.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The imperial crewman is without doubt the weakest figure, but that isn&#39;t to say I don&#39;t like it. A very similar crew member also appeared in 75055, but that one had a grey cap. This figure has a new, black cap. These imperials were more common on the Death Stars (see the scanning crew in &#39;A New Hope&#39;), whereas the grey capped variants can be seen on the bridges of Star Destroyers and other imperial crafts. I really like this detail, as it was completely unnecessary, and adds to the figure, even if it is only for Star Wars fans like me. Having said that, it is strange that he was included, as he wasn&#39;t in the game. Honestly, I would have preferred a Scout Trooper, as we haven&#39;t got one since 2013, and they appear in the game (And while a Shadow Trooper would make this set much better, I think that would be pushing it).</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s also worth noting that all figure have stud shooters, which I detest, and so I equipped the troopers with appropriate weaponry&nbsp;as soon as I got the set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Took about five - ten minutes, with nothing really notable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I am not really sure what the build is supposed to be, with some people saying a command centre, but some saying a vehicle. Honestly, I don&#39;t care, as I took it apart almost a as soon as I built it, as it doesn&#39;t appear in Battlefront, and doesn&#39;t resemble anything imperial from the cannon. The dark red pieces aren&#39;t normally associated with the empire, apart from some set designs from Ep. 4, making the whole thing even more strange. I think a 74-Z speeder bike, which last appeared in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10236-1/Ewok-Village"">10236</a>, or even an E-Web blaster like the one in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75098-1/Assault-on-Hoth"">75098</a>&nbsp;would have been better, as they both appear in the game.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The brilliant figures are the reason you get this set, not the build, so in that sense, it is&nbsp;a fabulous set that I definitely recommend.</p>

"Nuruodo","2016-02-02T22:20:53.007Z","Invented turret, real troopers","<p>I love &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot;, and since its launch&nbsp;I&#39;ve waited for Lego sets inspired by it. I&#39;ve to say that I&#39;m a bit disappointed by the fact that only a pair of Battle Packs were released, but however I&#39;ve decided to get them both. This one, the Galactic Empire BP, is very interesting due to the particular Stormtroopers included in it (there are no &quot;standard&quot; troopers, only particular oes).</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>The box is very small, as usual. On the front there are Imperials fighting on a sand planet (probably Tatooine), with incoming fire and the officer firing a missile from the &quot;platform&quot;. On the back there are play features (basically missile and stud shooters) and a new image with all troopers except one of the two jetpack-equipped&nbsp;ones working on the platform. Instructions are all contained in one slim book.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts are divided in a bag for bigger pieces and a bag for smaller pieces. They include a lot of transparent red bricks, most of them used for stud shooters. Other niece pieces are some little-rounded dark red 2x2 pieces, that are used for the &quot;cover&quot; of the control point.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are all from Galactic Empire: two Stormtroopers, a Shocktrooper and an Imperial officer. The officer is very nice; he seems to be a not-elevated rank officer, with a very simple uniform and no rank&nbsp;insignias on it. His cap is very attractive and modern, black-colored and with a microscopic Imperial logo on it. The Shocktrooper is similar to clone ones, but his helmet has bigger&nbsp;red signs and looks very well. The Stormtroopers aren&#39;t standard troopers, as I said before, but they in fact are called Jetpack Troopers: however I wasn&#39;t referring to the jetpacks, that are more different from Clone Wars ones (they are bigger, with the possibility of positioning three 1x1 pieces on them), but to their armors. These are scorched in some points, with blaster burns that give them a &quot;veteran&quot; appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was simple but enjoyable. I particularly liked the fact that the structure is not mirrored, with the missile launcher not repeated on the left. It was nice to create the control point at the top of the platform, but all the build wasn&#39;t very exciting.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The completed model</span></h3>

<p>Although I don&#39;t like the platform, it&#39;s very well made and appealing, because pieces are nicely combined and with few them it&#39;s given the idea of a military emplacement. The turret it&#39;s completely made of shooting parts, but strangely it doesn&#39;t look bad. Play features are all concentrated in it, and this fact made the main part of the platform a bit &quot;unuseful&quot;.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a Battle Pack, and as a Battle Pack I&#39;ll judge it for its minifigures. They are excellent, although I&#39;d preferred another Stormtrooper, maybe of a different type, instead of the officer. Lego could insert something really coming from &quot;Battlefront&quot; as main building, but they wanted to create a strange platform&nbsp;<em>ex novo</em>, so the result is that I don&#39;t like it but I appreciate it for the good techniques used in it. For the low price, it&#39;s a good purchase, perfect to act as counterpart of Rebel Alliance BP.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Low price</p>

<p>&ndash; Very good minifigures included (no standard Stormtroopers, all new!)</p>

<p>&ndash; Well built platform</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>&ndash; The platform is invented and it isn&#39;t inspired bt &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot;</p>

<p>&ndash; Play features are concentrated only in the turret</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard sized box and instructions for a set of this size. However, i feel it could&#39;ve been advertised on the boz that it was a Battlefront inspired set, as i only found this information from other collectors.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set had great, useful, parts! The dark red pieces are always very useful for custom builds and i used most of them on a custom Clone Walker. A lot of other useful but more common parts but you can never have enough! The missile shooter was also appreciated.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>These minifgures are the best I&#39;ve seen included in a battle pack in a long time! Incredible detailing on the stormtroopers that BOTH include a jump pack which looks great. The shock trooper is my personal favorite&nbsp;as the detailing is great and he&#39;s the first shock trooper i own. The general is nice but i think i&#39;m not the only one who would&#39;ve appreciated another stormtrooper.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how long it&#39;ll take for Lego to change the blasters and how much more complaining the Lego community will have to make before we get back the original molded blasters. I hate these stud shooters as they are far too large and ugly, i replaced the blasters on the figures with molded ones.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Because it&#39;s such a small model, the build is quick, 5 mins max. The techniques are common and not challenging at all. Overall, an easy, simple, build clearly aimed at the younger audience.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The main build is a rather underwhelming&nbsp;&#39;commnd post&#39; which isnt seen in the Battlefront game (I&#39;m not sure what else they could&#39;ve included). I was not a fan of the build so i broke it down for parts, which come in handy.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, i would highly recommend this set! Despite the pretty poor command post, the incredible minifigures more than make up for it! Its a perfect set to build up your imperial army as it&#39;s been a while since we had good&nbsp;OT imperial sets. Must buy for any collector!</p>

"Japanbuilder","2016-10-04T14:32:02.027Z","Battlefront in your real hands! ","<p>Battlefront is brought to LEGO who brings it to life for all fans of the game. There in lies the appeal and probably the lack of appeal with this set. Let&#39;s examine it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is great at depicting part of a battle in some world far far away. The Storm Troopers are catching and the scene is well set up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are brief&nbsp;and there are no stickers included which is great.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are mostly good. The molds for the jet packs are great but the reddish-brown bracing pieces are a bit of an odd selection for an imperial build. Regardless, these will be your left over parts when you finish.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The real draw of these battle packs is the minifigures. And these, if you are a fan of battlefront, are great! The shock trooper is great with awesome printing. The battle scarred storm troopers also look fantastic. The technician also comes with great printing despite its simple overall look it is full of detail. The seams are well placed on his uniform and the imperial pin on his cap is great!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is simple. A few technic pins here and there but mostly it is brick built and comes together quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The build is disappointing. Aside from the figures I have not noticed anything like the main build in either the original trilogy or battlefront. But I only have vanilla battlefront so perhaps it has been in a DLC someplace. Either way I do not recognize it and the color scheme on it does not look imperial to me.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this is great for battlefront fans and fans who want to make a battle diorama. The scarring on the troopers is great looking though at times I do wish one of the troopers came with a pristine suit as sometimes I would like to arrange them in non-battle scenes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also am not a fan of the stud launchers. They look clunky or like more powerful rocket launchers or other heavy weapons. The color of the build does not look like anything in use by the Galactic Empire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully this is LEGO a few of these sets together and a few modifications can make it even better!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I recommend this to any fan of the franchise and anyone looking to set up a grizzled troupe of storm troopers!&nbsp;</p>

"VaderFan2187","2016-12-16T01:16:47.793Z","Great Little Set","<p>Today I have 75134 Galactic Empire Battle Pack to review! It is $12.99, comes with a little build and four minifigures (standard Battle Pack stuff). The question is, is it worth it?</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is okay. Small, a little uninteresting, but that cannot be helped at this price range. Still, it&#39;s not extremely symmetrical, so there wasn&#39;t much repetition.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Aside from those which make up the minifigures, there aren&#39;t too many interesting parts. However, there are some nice dark red pieces, and I think this is the first time a spring-loaded shooter has appeared in a battle pack (Battle on Saleucami notwithstanding). There are also two generic control 1x2 tiles and a translucent brown 1x2 windscreen.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Playability is alright. You can shoot the aforementioned missile, shoot the 4 stud shooters included, clip the weapons on the front of the technician&#39;s seat, and place 2 minifigures onto the build (or more).</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The value is alright. 109 pieces doesn&#39;t hit 10c per piece perfectly, but it&#39;s better value than the First Order Battle Pack.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>95% or more of the time, that&#39;s what you buy a battle pack for, right? The minifigures in the set are good. You get an <strong>Imperial Technician</strong> with a black version of the new kepi style. You get two <strong>Jetpack-equipped Stormtroopers</strong>, and they get great white jetpacks. The figures themselves are battle-damaged versions of the regular stormtroopers too. The final minifigure is a <strong>Imperial Shock Trooper</strong>, and he&#39;s basically a normal stormtrooper with the shock trooper markings (think of 2014&#39;s shock trooper figures + latest stormtrooper figures). I love this guy, he looks great.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>I like this set. It&#39;s a good battle pack with nice minifigures. Get it.</p>

<p><em><strong>figures</strong></em></p>

<p>You get two battle damaged stormtroopers&nbsp;one shock trooper and one officer&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a lot of figures for a battle pack the battle damaged stormtroopers are amazing plus the jet pack is very detailed and sleek but the main reason to get this set is for the shock trooper as it is brand new and also very detailed. The officer not fussed about him really.</p>

<p><em><strong>Build</strong></em></p>

<p>The structure is actually very useful for a moc and is not pointless.</p>

<p>Very pleased</p>
