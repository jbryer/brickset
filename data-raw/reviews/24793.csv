"A_Brickset_user","2015-12-26T22:22:37.67Z","Wow! Battlefront!","<p>This battle pack along with it&#39;s companion (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75134-1/Galactic-Empire-Battle-Pack"" name=""75134"">75134</a>) is clearly based on the recently released Star Wars Battlefront video game. My first thought was that the battle packs would be based completely on the game (like&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7672-1/Rogue-Shadow"" name=""7672"">7672</a>&nbsp;was based on The Force Unleashed game), but apparently only 3 of 4 minifigures in each&nbsp;set&nbsp;is&nbsp;based on the actual game.</p>

<p>I bought the full version of the game (Ultimate Edition) and I have played it long enough on the Xbox One to get an good overview of the features.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is the new Force Awakens/Kylo Ren box in the regular battle pack size.<br />
Here it would be really nice if LEGO made a Battlefront themed box or at least like the &#39;Rogue Shadow&#39;&nbsp;(7672) made a patch on the box.</p>

<p>2 small bags and a single folded instruction manual, all bricks in bags.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>New parts are used to make up the four (4) new minifigures, also a new mold has been used to make a new helmet and a new Jump Pack mold which also is included in &#39;Galactic Empire Battle Pack&#39; (75134), one flat tile with some great&nbsp;printing goes onto the back of the jump pack which is a very nice detail.&nbsp;Most parts make up the main creation which is a new brown speeder bike like never before... jk.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This is where the deal appears - the battle pack includes as usual at total of four (4) new minifigures.&nbsp;This time on the rebels side we have some Tatooine/Jakku&nbsp;theme troopers;&nbsp;2 humans, 1 Rodian and 1 Duros. Two (2) of the troopers have the Battlefront Jump&nbsp;pack&nbsp;on their back.</p>

<p>The figures are really nice, but there is still a small lack of detail; the clothing is not actual to the game, the only one wearing complete clothing is the Duros and since the Jump Pack replaces the standard backpack the Rodian should wear a backpack and I don&#39;t care if he cannot sit down for that reason, because that speeder bike is not even in the game.<br />
Also the usual stud blasters are ugly once again and would have been better off by being replaced by regular blasters or even new molded blasters.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>No big deal here, just the quick battle pack build.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>New Star Wars Battlefront inspired minifigures, wow, great! Thanks LEGO!</p>

<p>Unarmed second human is rather random and not in the game (only clothing and head, maybe).</p>

<p>Kind of random build speeder bike is familiar to the famous 74-Z speeder bike (which is in the game), but it is not that speeder bike and is therefore not an &quot;real&quot; Star Wars Battlefront set.<br />
The speeder itself is alright, perhaps a little oversized like many smaller models appear.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing&nbsp;to see LEGO making Star Wars sets inspired by Star Wars Battlefront -- It would be super amazing to see LEGO making Star Wars sets completely based on Star Wars Battlefront.</p>

"Alkuzar","2015-12-27T12:50:10.483Z","Nice set for collectors of Minifigures and fans of Star Wars Battlefront","<p>Reason i got interested in this set, is because it&#39;s based on Star Wars Battlefront. So it will look good with my other Star Wars LEGO sets based on games.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box looks good and gives you like all LEGO sets a good idea what is in the box and on the back you also see they playable features.</p>

<p>Not much to say about the instructions, they are plain and simple. So&nbsp;easy to understand for all ages.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with all LEGO Battle packs, it does not have a lot of parts. But there are many small parts, so be careful with younger children when building this set.</p>

<p>Only parts i dislike from this set are the stud shooters, i have never been a fan of these since LEGO started making them. I rather would have that they put in the old style blasters.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is the best part of the set for me personal and a lot of other collectors. The Rebel&nbsp;Troopers are looking amazing with the new print and colors of the helmets. They are&nbsp;really well done compared to the ingame version of the Troopers. It&#39;s also nice that you get a Rodian and Duros&nbsp;Trooper.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself also does not belong in this set, as there is nothing in the game that resembles this. The only speeder in&nbsp;game is the same speeder as&nbsp;you see the Scout Troopers use on Endor.</p>

<p>It would be better if they added a dish turret as they are used by the Rebel Alliance on multiple battles on multiple planets in the game, not only on Hoth.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Because this is a battle pack the completed model is not much to look at, but like i said above i do not think this build fits with the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Even though the build itself is not based on anything in the Battlefront game. I do like this set for being based on the game.</p>

<p>Because of this i do think the set is worth getting for people who like the game and for people who collect Minifigures as they are all very good looking.</p>

<p>So all in all, i think this set is worth getting it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>Box shows the set well, the now standard action points on the back,</p>

<p>Instructions seem a little small to me, but that&#39;s me being picky</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>A couple of non-standard parts, especially at the back on the speeder bike which uses a different piece, I cant remember coming across this part before but I&#39;ve not double checked to be fair: Bulk of the pieces are brown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>4 Figures, all rebels, 2 Humans, 1 Duros and 1 Rodian, I like the figures, 2 jet packs, You have 2 prints for the figures, and a helmet on the Human with the other wearing a hat, similar if not the same as one used in hoth sets</p>

<p>The Duros head piece is based on earlier head piece for Cad Bane which makes sense as both are Duros but this one is a lighter blue, I dont mind saying my kids noticed this first.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>Good simple build, the speeder is obviously the bulk of the build, didn&#39;t take to long.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>A nice effective set, looks good, I&#39;m not a fan of the stud shooters for the figures as I like to display my sets and they look a bit out of context in size, my son on the other hand loves them as it makes them more playable.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I like Battle packs, I think they are good value for money, especially as you get 4 figures, These are based on Star Wars Battlefront game, so the figures do match, The speeder bike I&#39;ve not seen in the game it&#39;s your more normal Speeder, unless of course it will be added at a later date, who knows.</p>

<p>This is a good set, and one I was  looking forward to getting.</p>

"Nuruodo","2016-02-05T22:37:02.87Z","The best speeder bike","<p>I bought this set not only because it appears in &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot; (although the standard speeder bike is different from this one) but also because I particularly like the model. Its low price made me not think two times about the acquire, and finally I got it:&nbsp;I found surely the best speeder bike (although it isn&#39;t loyal to medias), fantastic minifigures and also rare pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is very small, as usual. On the front there is the speeder bike hurtling between explosions&nbsp;on a desert planet (probably Tatooine), sided by two Jetpack&nbsp;troopers. On the back there are play features (only missile and stud shooters) and a picture of the troopers in different positions. Instructions are all contained in one slim book.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts are brown colored, and this already makes them a bit rare. But the impressing thing is that I found very rare bricks, like the one to whom the turret is attached, that I had never seen before. Other particular pieces are the one used just before the two axes of the&nbsp;&quot;nose&quot;, the one in which the blaster is inserted and probably the axes of the &quot;nose&quot; too.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are superb. They are all different rebel troopers: a Rodian one, a Duros one (with jetpack), and two humans (including one with jetpack). One of the things that I like the most is that only two types of torso and legs are used, but they are changed in every figure, as there aren&#39;t troopers&nbsp;looking identical. The helmet of the jetpack human trooper is fantastic: it&#39;s taken directly from &quot;Battlefront&quot;, and while I like it in the game I love it in Lego dimension. Rodian&nbsp;head is very nice and detailed, and the same can be said about the Duros one. Jetpacks are of the same kind of 75134, but grey colored and with a pale brown 1x1 piece instead of a white one: as I said for that set, I do prefer them compared to Clone Wars ones.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was fast and smart. There isn&#39;t anything to say, except that I liked the start of the build: the first piece was&nbsp;a rectangular piece, yes, and I thought I was building the bike&#39;s hull, but after few passages the brick was rotated and became the pominent&nbsp;rear.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is nice. It isn&#39;t a &quot;real&quot; speeder bike, but it resembles the &quot;Episode VI&quot; one that also appears in &quot;Battlefront&quot;. It&#39;s very well looking, because it isn&#39;t so small as older speeder bikes (I could say that it&#39;s nearer to &quot;Rebels&quot; bikes than to original trilogy ones). The second seat is well defined, with a stud&nbsp;shooter turret that is however pleasant to be seen. In complex, a definitely good speeder bike.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This Battle Pack is probably the one with best model in the 2016 wave. About the figures nothing can be said, they are excellent, but maybe people could like more Stormtroopers than these rebels. Considering that the price is little, that the price-for-piece rate is good and that so are the contents, I&#39;d say that this set is one of the best in this first Star Wars wave.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; Not-so-small and detailed model</p>

<p>&ndash; Excellent minifigures</p>

<p>&ndash; Low price and good price-for-piece rate</p>

<p>&ndash; Use of rare pieces</p>

<p><b>Cons:</b></p>

<p>&ndash; The speeder bike is a bit invented</p>

<p>&ndash; Minifigures&nbsp;have substantially same body and legs</p>

"ToaMatoro","2016-05-11T22:04:43.003Z","Good Speeder Bike, Great Figures","<p>I don&#39;t often review sets, and there are really only two reasons that I ever decide to do so. The first is that a set was simply so outstanding that I had to share my opinion on it. The second scenario is that I hesitated fr a long time before buying a set, and was pleasantly surprised when I made my choice. This review falls under the latter category. I didn&#39;t know quite what to make of this battle pack, but when I finally bought and built it, I was very pleased.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box</span><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box is a rectangle, and the instructions are made of paper- no surprises there.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I would say that this set contains a decent parts selection. the brown angles and arches aren&#39;t particularly common and can be useful, and I believe the brown engines are unique to this set (though I could be wrong). Overall, the parts selection is on the upper end of average. Nothing incredible, but not at all disappointing either&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Seeing as these tend to be the focus of the battle&nbsp;pack, the figures are my main concern here. They are definitely the part of the set that most drew me in, and they definitely did not disappoint. The variety is excellent. Firstly, while there are only two new torso and leg prints, they are printed to fit together seamlessly, so that the belt on the waist matches up with the printing at the base of the torso, regardless of how you connect them. This makes for 4 unique outfits that I think all look really great.</p>

<p>As for the completed minifigures, I really love them all. The inclusion of a Duros and Rodian&nbsp;makes for an exceptional amount of variety&nbsp;and really adds to the customization feel that Battlefront offers. Likewise, the two jump packs&nbsp;look excellent, and the dark brown pilot&#39;s helmet worn by one of the human rebels is one of my favorite star wars accessories to date.</p>

<p>Perhaps my only complaint here is the hand-held stud shooters. Unlike some, I am not really opposed to their inclusion- I find them to be quite fun, but they do seem particularly out of place in a set that is mimicking&nbsp;Battlefront- wherein weapons are a key choice in creating your character. I admittedly swapped them out for blaster rifles and pistols upon building the set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was nothing particularly astonishing. I&#39;ll get to my opinion of the model soon, but the actual build of the set was fairly short and simple, probably taking 20 minutes tops (and I&#39;m a slow builder). There are of course a few SNOT spots that are always nice, but nothing out of the ordinary</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The main model&nbsp;is where I was hesitant when deciding whether or not to purchase the set. The modified speeder bike was a creative idea, but it seemed a bit bulky and large for a speeder bike. Building the set hasn&#39;t completely changed my mind on that, but I do appreciate it more now that I have built it. Though it is a bit large, the design looks very nice, and the guns placed on it give it a modified, rebel-esque feel. I approve! Add the minifigures to this model, and in my opinion you have an excellent little arm builder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Again, I am mainly writing this review for those who, like me, were hesitant about this set at the outset. I am really happy that I bought it. The minifigures alone make the set worth it, and the bike pleasantly surprised me. I definitely recommend it!</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong> a variety of incredible&nbsp;minifigures, the pilot helmet (its a pro in itself!), a better-than-expected speeder</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong>&nbsp;stud shooters don&#39;t quite fit as minifigure&nbsp;weapons, the bike is a tad bulky.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard size battlepack box with a nice action image on the front. The back details the weaponry available to the troopers, a &#39;holo tech spec&#39; of the speeder bike and pictures demonstrating the bike&#39;s stud shooters.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a battle pack and nice to have more dark brown pieces.<br />
The updated Mitrinomon jet packs have extended thrusters which are capped by clear discs and have a patterned tile in the back. I rather like this design.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The highlight of the set and really what you&#39;re buying this set for. You get 4 Rebel Troopers and it&#39;s nice to see some alien ones mixed in with the generic humans we get so often.<br />
The detailing on the uniforms is nicely done and the helmet for the aerial assault trooper is well done.<br />
A Rodian head with some darker detailing and a Duros&nbsp;head make nice additions to the Rebel ranks</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As usual, a 5 minute battlepack build. Fun for army building and nothing we haven&#39;t seen before so very straightforward.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The speeder bike is nice, a sturdier design similar to the build we have for the bikes in the Rebels series but a little lighter. The bike sits 2 troopers.<br />
The front has access to movable control grips and there is a printed control panel as well. The aft is a gun turret with a stud shooter.<br />
There is also a forward mounted stud shooter on the right side of the bike.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A nice battlepack&nbsp;and one for the army builders out there. I&#39;m not a fan of the stud shooters and with they would just make Star Wars style weapons for them to hold instead.&nbsp;The bike is pretty much a &#39;take it or leave it&#39; vehicle but the figures are definitely what make this set worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>By far 2016 has provided superior sets for the Alliance and the Resistance when it comes to Battle Packs. This one in particular is probably the best Battlepack of 2016, 4 commodity units in a single pack with amazing printing and great equipment. To add icing to the cake their outfits&nbsp;are fully interchangeable and amassing even 3 of these allows for a unique troupe of soldiers to fill your ranks. This explodes even further if you swap pieces with set 75131, particularly the heads on that set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have the means to replace the stud shooters and add packs to your troops you can make a fierce looking rebel commando strike force to take on the Empire!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only downside, if I had to point one out, is the fact that LEGO insists of packing only stud launchers on these packs. Having the option of stud launchers and traditional blaster molds would be a much more welcome compromise than just the stud launchers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the stud launchers this is a great pack with which to amass a ton of troopers and highlights just how lacking&nbsp;on useful units the First Order Battlepack and Galactic Empire Battlepack have been these year. 2016 definitely has gone the way of the Light Side of the Force! I hope we get more Battlefront inspired packs next year! I would love the Twi&#39;lek and Zabrak as well as some human female rebel units next year.&nbsp;</p>

The front of the bike in my opinion is good and classic, but the back was simply terrible. The parts are useful though, and all the minifigs are calm. I&#39;d recommend it at a low discount but there are far better to be bought for the normal price.&nbsp;</p>
