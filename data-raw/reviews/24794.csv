"BVA8007","2015-12-30T20:35:17.343Z","Flying side by side","<p><strong>This Red Eta-2&nbsp;Jedi&nbsp;Starfighter instantly reminds me of Anakin&#39;s yellow version (2014). It was brought only once before to the LEGO galaxy in 2005. Finally we&#39;ve the chance to let them fly side by side. </strong></p>

<h3>Box &amp;&nbsp;Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box shows the Starfighter in a flying position. Also the R4 unit en the Obi-Wan Kenobi&nbsp;minifigure are shown on the front.The back of the box shows how to fold the wings, open the cockpit and shoot the missiles. Of&nbsp;course the top right shows the blueprints of the Starfighter.&nbsp;The instruction booklet usually shows to other models of the wave, but that&#39;s not the case this time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts &amp;&nbsp;Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set contains 215 pieces. And accept the cockpit piece&nbsp;(witch you&#39;ll hate or love) there are no other special or interesting pieces. The pieces come in three numbered bags. Unfortunately there&#39;s a large&nbsp;sheet with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set only contains two minifigures, if you&#39;ll include&nbsp;the R4 unit. However... the Obi-Wan minifigure is very&nbsp;nice. Just like Anakin in the yellow version, Obi-Wan&#39;s face is printed with a comlink-system.</p>

<h3>The build &amp;&nbsp;The completed model</h3>

<p>I started building this model&nbsp;with the yellow version in mind. I expected more of the same, compared to Anakin&#39;s Jedi Starfighter, but I was pleasantly&nbsp;surprised. The built felt different, but in a good way. Although&nbsp;I&#39;m not very fond of the stickers, I&#39;d enjoyed building the Starfighter. The completed model is a sturdy and movie accurate&nbsp;LEGO version. I was already pleased&nbsp;to&nbsp;have 2014 within my collection, but i&#39;m glad to ad this new one. Now they realy&nbsp;can fly side by side. Just like in the opening scene of Episode III. On top of that, I even like this one better than the previous versions of all Eta-2 Jedi Starfighters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was able to buy this set with an introduction discount on a Dutch Website. Instead of paying 34,99 Euro&#39;s, I paid&nbsp;just over 25 Euro. Because of the discount I&#39;m satisfied with the value for money. Otherwise I&#39;ll think this set is heavily overpriced just like the other sets of this wave. Leaving the price&nbsp;tag&nbsp;out of consideration, I think this is one nice little Jedi Starfighter. I&#39;ll recommend this set to everybody, regardless you own the yellow 2014 version or not.&nbsp;</p>

"TK_1308","2016-01-11T12:13:36.643Z","""Flying's for droids!""","<p>Lego releases the second version of Obi-Wan&#39;s fighter from the battle of Coruscant.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mid range small kit box with a nice set image on the front. Obi-Wan is the figure of choice for 1:1 image on the top but R4-P17 is next to him. The back has the &#39;holo tech spec&#39; ETA-Actis 3 from force, dorsal and starboard forward views. The main picture shows Obi-Wan and R4 leaping from the Interceptor into battle. There is a picture of all the weapons included and images showing the astromech bay, missile launchers, wings and cockpit features.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. A nice selection of pieces and colours. There are three bags in the box. Bag 1 contains the central hull / cockpit. Bag 2 contains R4-P17 and the port wing. Bag 3 contains the starboard wing.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The kit comes with 2 minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have Obi-Wan Kenobi in his Jedi gear. The body has nice printing and details on it. The head comes with printed detailing for the Jedi flight headset on the right hand side. The head is double sided with his &#39;concentrating&#39; face on one side and his &#39;Flying&#39;s for droids!&#39; face on the other.&nbsp;<br />
Then we have R4-P17. Nothing new here but you can never have enough astromechs.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 15 minutes.&nbsp;<br />
Yes, there are stickers. There are the standard 8 on the deployable outer wings, two on the main wings underneath the upper outer wings and the standard 2 up by the end on the blaster cannons at the front. A nice addition to the set this time are the &#39;kill total&#39; markings. These go on the upper back part of the wings next to the cockpit. Personally I think they look better on the side of the cockpit itself but that&#39;s a matter of choice. Oddly enough, there are no control console stickers in this version so there are no controls with which Obi-Wan can fly the ship.<br />
If you think this Interceptor is pretty much going to be the same build as 2014&#39;s 75038 Jedi Interceptor set in a different colour you&#39;ll be mistaken.<br />
There are a lot of subtle differences in the build. The cockpit canopy does not close properly at the front because of the single centre stud tile. I don&#39;t recall this being an issue with the 2014 version but this one will not stay closed. If this was 2x1 tile, it would&#39;ve been better. This means the cockpit falls open when &#39;flown&#39; at an angle or upside down which may be annoying for kids.&nbsp;<br />
The wings have several small construction differences and the droid compartment is more sturdy in its construction and R4&#39;s legs do not &#39;hang out&#39; like R2&#39;s do on the pervious versions.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Another nice Interceptor for the collection but really nothing tremendously exciting if you&#39;d already got the one from 2014 but it&#39;s a nice addition if you failed to get the 7283 Ultimate Space Battle from 2005.<br />
It&#39;s a good representation of the ETA-Actis 3 Interceptor and measures 18 cm long, 15.5 cm wide and 7 cm tall.<br />
It features the standard opening cockpit canopy, deployable outer wings and 2 spring loaded missile launchers. This set has been marked down because of the badly designed cockpit feature which seems determined to throw Obi-Wan to his death.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A nice kit and one to continue the ROTS series alongside 2014&#39;s 75038 Jedi Interceptor and 2012&#39;s 9494 Anakin&#39;s Jedi Interceptor. I guess in 2017/18 we&#39;ll have Obi-Wan&#39;s blue version with an updated Syliure-45 Hyperspace Ring. I&#39;ll bet 1000 Republic credits on that right now.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>Midsize box, plenty of action shots on the back, nice striking picture on the front, Kylo Ren looking on in the corner.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>217 parts, mainly red and grey, a few technic parts in the cockpit to help fit the wings and canopy</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>1 figure and 1 droid. I believe this is a new Obi Wan, looks good, bottoms match to top, when you think how many Obi Wans we have it must be a challenge to make them different, this one has a 2 sided face, also shows his head gear, comes with his lightsaber,&nbsp;as for the droid R4-P17 which is your standard Astro droid red and white.</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>Not to difficult, set comes split in 3 bags, you build the cockpit first then the wings, model fits together well, there are 2 spring loaded shooters, set also comes with a sticker sheet, 14 stickers 8 of which are for the wings, I&#39;m not a fan of stickers but they do complete the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>Its a good build, couple of moans the droid sticks out a bit, and The cockpit is a bit simple on the inside, no control stick of instrument display, other then that it&#39;s a nice set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>At the start of Revenge of the Sith we see our 2 Jedi flying into battle, Obi in his red fighter Anakin in his yellow fighter, This was recreated in set 7283, Anakins fighter was rereleased in set 75038, and this set now adds to the collection.&nbsp;I don&#39;t have set 7283 but do have 75038, together they complement each other well, Lego has released a few Other Jedi Fighters over the years and they have come a long&nbsp;way, the older ones only had the droid head, so the fact now the whole droid fits adds to the playability and looks more&nbsp;similar to the films. I like this set, good value for money,&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Box/Instructions</h2>

<p>Box are great - it has face of Kylo Ren for this &nbsp;year&#39;s season</p>

<p>Obi Wan wit two faces (serious and panicking) - with the cool Lightsaber</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The starfighter is great! probably better than the 2014 one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three problems,</p>

<p>one - <strong>NO lightsaber storage</strong>! nothing annoys me more than the clickety&nbsp;noise the lightsaber makes when they are just stored inside the cabin &quot;unsecured&quot;... they did it really well with Anakin&#39;s 2014 model where they have the &quot;claws&quot; bit that secure each section of the lightsaber. I have to let Obi hold each bits of his lightsaber with both hands (how is he gonna steer his ship?). Unsure why Lego decided to&nbsp;move&nbsp;backwards&nbsp;with this year&#39;s model.</p>

<p>two - <strong>not enough overhead clearance in the cockpit</strong> - you really have to sit Obi in a slight recline / recumbent position because&nbsp;of this. If you try to sit Obi upright, his head will bump into the cockpit (hence you will&nbsp;not be&nbsp;able to close it ...)</p>

<p>three - poor R4 - <strong>he is standing by 1 stud height taller than R2</strong> ... exposing wayyy to much of his upper torso. For one this actually looks more awkward, and second - it exposes poor R4 to those pesky buzz droids! and stray lasers (that could hit him?).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>- looks better than the 2014 model</p>

<p>- really more awkward cabin (no lightsaber&nbsp;storage, and poor overhead clearance)&nbsp;</p>

<p>- awkward cabin depth for R4 - exposing too much of his upper torso</p>

<p>- but otherwise! this is a really great space battle companion with&nbsp;<strong>75038</strong>&nbsp;</p>

"Echolord","2016-05-06T12:15:41.817Z","Better in concept. ","<p>Obi-wan Kenobi&#39;s Eta-2 Actis Light class Interceptor, seen in the opening scene of STAR WARS: Revenge of the Sith. Two years ago, we received Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;Interceptor in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75038-1/Jedi-Interceptor"">75038 Jedi Interceptor</a>. After I got that one, back in 2014, I knew I wanted Obi-wan&#39;s. However, I was expecting the design to be closer to the one from 2014, which shared a very similar design to <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9494-1/Anakin-s-Jedi-Interceptor"">9494 Anakin&#39;s Jedi Interceptor</a>. Sadly, this was not the case. The cockpit and wings have been completely redesigned, and not for the better.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a simple, standard sized box for a $20 set. The graphics of the Interceptor are very well designed, and look great on a LEGO box. The instruction manual is small, probably 40 pages. At the back, there is an advertisement for the Force Builder App, showing the yellow Jedi Interceptor redesigned like this red one, which is very disappointing. A large sticker sheet is also included.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Obi-wan Kenobi&#39;s new minifigure is very well designed. It uses the same torso and legs as the 2014 variant <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75040-1/General-Grievous-Wheel-Bike"">(75040 General Grievous&#39; Wheelbike)</a>&nbsp;Once again, the design is perfect, capturing his tunic from Revenge of the Sith quite well. In my opinion, this design cannot get any better. The hair is also the same from that minifigure. The head is the unique part, and it looks amazing. The main expression shows a frown, with creased eyebrows. His pilot headset is printed on the left side of his face. When compared to the Anakin&nbsp;minifigure from 2014, the headset design has not changed. The alternate expression shows a surprised face, with an open, scared looking mouth, and a different eyebrow position. Once again, the headset is present on this face. Both expressions have his beard. This minifigure also includes his blue Lightsaber.&nbsp;</p>

<p>R4-P17, Obi-wan&#39;s loyal astromech droid is also depicted quite well in LEGO form. her torso part is the same design as the last version from 2013 (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75006-1/Jedi-Starfighter-Planet-Kamino"">75006 Jedi Starfighter and Kamino</a>). Her dome is the only update, which now features the ring around the base of her dome, and updated printing for the design. This minifigure is much appreciated in my collection, as is her master.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is split into three bags. One for the cockpit, one for the right wing, and one for the left. The build is simple, and uses a lot of technic parts in the cockpit, which I kind of like more than the sticker from 2014. The new wings are slightly longer than those of the 2014 version of the ship, by one stud. The shape of the wing has changed slightly, now using 1x3 arch pieces, instead of the 2x4x1&nbsp;corner roof elements as before. This enables a sticker to be placed on each one, with Obi-wan&#39;s Tri-Fighter kill count. The new wing design uses a lot more stickers (7 per wing). These are the kill count, the grey trapezoid on the front of the wings, representing ventilation, a large 3x4 sticker that depicts the Open Circle Fleet emblem, some red detailing, and some lines of the ship; the two stickers on the inside of each wing flap, detailing more ventilation, and the outside of each wing flap, which shows the grey and yellow detailing on the outside of the wings. This design is reversed on the other wing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks decent, if you can ignore the fact that R4 sticks up a whole brick of her body showing above the wing. This is caused by her socket being too close to the wing, and not enough space for her legs. Had LEGO reused the 2014 wing design, this would not have been a problem. However, it is a simple fix, requiring the removal of the two 2x5x1 changing elevation plates (I&#39;m really not sure what to call them), and replacing that structure with a 2x4 up slant piece, with a 2x2 stud plate in the middle. Place a 2x2 tile with a single stud here, and 2 1x2 plates on one upper side, and then another 1x2 on the other side, then attack in place of the original socket. repeat on the other side.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is not the best it could have been, but it is not horrible. It can be fixed, and I plan to continue working on improving it. I do recommend that you get this, if you have the latest two interceptors, but not a red one.&nbsp;</p>

"Hugh_s_Brix","2016-04-09T01:49:03.93Z","Obi Wan's Jedi Interceptor","<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is a medium size with a picture of Kylo&nbsp;Ren in the corner. The front of the box displays a space battle and the back of the box displays some of the play features in the set along with the weapons&nbsp;included in the set.&nbsp;The instructions show the same art as the box on the front and are a small/medium size.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set contains 215 pieces which are&nbsp;mainly red and grey. These pieces are divided into 3 bags. I for the cockpit and 2 for each wing. I really like the printing on the republic logo (side of the left wing.) The set also comes with a large number of stickers to place.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures in the set are Obi Wan Kenobi and R4-P17 Astromech&nbsp;droid.</p>

<p>Obi wan has orange/brown hair and beard eith a golden headset on his head.he has two expressions, one being a concerned face and a scared face. His torso and arms are in light tan to represent his robes. He has a belt and some crease lines in his robes. His legs are dark tan with a light tan robe carried down from the torso. The printing on his back shows some crease lines and a belt. He comes with a blue lightsaber&nbsp;with a silver handle.</p>

<p>R4-P17&nbsp;uses all the classic astromech droid pieces.&nbsp;the droids head is red with some dark grey details on it. he has one black eye in the center. His body part is white with some red and silver detailing.</p>

<p>The minifigures in the set are good but I wish it came with a battle droid.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build of the set was pretty interesting despite all the stickers in the set. I didn&#39;t really like the way that one wing was built in bag 2 and one in bag 3. It just seemed very repetitive. I wish Both wings were constructed at the ame time throughout bags 2 and 3.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks very good. It has some nice views from different angles and the printing on the cockpit looks great. My only complaints are that there is no place to store&nbsp;Obi wan&#39;s lightsaber and that R4-P17 sticks way too high out of the wing. Otherwise it is a good set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think the set is good and would go well with the Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;Jedi Interceptor set and some vulture droids. I would recommend this set.</p>

"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2016-08-01T07:20:39.953Z","Enjoyable despite an egregious sticker error","<p>I am a fan of Revenge of the Sith, the Eta-2 Actis Jedi Interceptors, the battle of Coruscant, and of having representations of ships and vehicles from the movies. I missed the boat on Ultimate Space Battle from 2005, previously the only official set of Obi-Wan&#39;s crimson interceptor, and nowadays it tends to command a rather high price on the secondary market. I had originally planned on slowly gathering the parts I needed to build my own (and painting the S-foil flags from my duplicate 7256).. But then, this set came out. As soon as I learned it existed I had to have it and at the first opportunity I went to Target and bought it with the last of my recycling money.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is large enough that LEGO deemed the security of glued sides and a press-out tab unnecessary; the side flaps are sealed with tape, allowing the box to be opened without damage. Unfortunately they are designed in a manner that prevents them from closing again without further tape.</p>

<p>The front of the box depicts the fighter zooming through the Battle of Coruscant... with distant Imperial Star Destroyers in the background instead of Republic ones because someone was evidently not paying attention... and firing off its missile pieces (which in this case represent laser shots). The back has showcase shots of the fighter&#39;s features and an action shot of the fighter skidding to a halt in the Invisible Hand&#39;s hangar bay while Obi-Wan and R4-P17 leap out to face offscreen battle droids (R4 and the fighter are oddly intact; I guess the Buzz Droids weren&#39;t up for waiting two years ;) ?).The sides have the usual 1:1 &quot;character card&quot; images of the minifigures and portrait of the completed model. There are no cross-sells.</p>

<p>The instructions are very clear and easily followed; there are no erroneous steps or misleading viewing angles.Be warned, though; it&#39;s possible for them to end up bent around one of the parts bags - mine were.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a Jedi Interceptor, so that means five specific parts first and foremost: four of the hexagonal flag S-foils, and the bulbous cockpit piece. The cockpit piece is the improved version introduced in 2014&#39;s 75038 Jedi Interceptor - where the original piece from 7256 had half-hollow front and back ends with simple arched notches, the redesign has solid ends with a space to snap in a 1x2 brick. There are also assorted tiles, wing plates, hinge plates, regular plates, a pair of stepped plates, a pair of spring-loaded 1x4 missille-launcher bricks, three translucent green missiles for them, several 4x4 &quot;L&quot; plates, and assorted Technic pieces that make up half the cockpit. Sadly, there are none of the little two-piece control levers included. Even though they were perfectly within the budget and could be added without changing anything else in the design. I&#39;m dinging the parts a point for that.</p>

<p>There is also a decal sheet. As with 9494 it includes stickers for the outside detail of the S-foils in addition to the inside radiator surfaces, something neglected by 7661 and 7283 (both of which left Obi-Wan&#39;s fighter du jour with one-color S-foils like Anakin&#39;s yellow one). A new detail included on this particular sheet is the rows of confirmed kill markings found on either side of the cockpit cowling (these can be seen in the movie). They are intended to have the side with a single prong sticking out point toward the cockpit when applied.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are no decals to represent the internal control panels. Even more unfortunately, two of the decals (#s 1 and 2, which have detail for the rear of the wings) contain an error: The circular logo is rotated 90 degrees the wrong way; the openings in its crimson border should be pointing at the front and back of the wings. LEGO has gotten the placement right in every Jedi Interceptor set after 7256. so there&#39;s no excuse. And at least in 7256 the logo was on separate tiles that could be rotated to the proper position; here, the problem can&#39;t be fixed without cutting the logo out of the larger sticker. That&#39;s another point off for the parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two; R4-P17 in her entirety, and a modern Episode III Obi-Wan complete with lightsabre. Obi-Wan is highly detailed, with printing on the front and back of his torso and a tunic print that extends down to his legs (which are otherwise dark tan, matching his pants from the movie). To go with this being a starfighter set, he has a comlink headset included in his face printing. As is fairly common for Star Wars minifigs these days, his head has two different expressions printed on it. One is determined, one is anxious - appropriate, considering the movie.</p>

<p>R4 is your basic LEGO Star Wars R-series astromech, a design which (aside from some new head types being added) has gone largely unchanged (the body piece was retooled to hold Technic axles sometime in the early 2000s, but that&#39;s it.) since 1999. Her head is the same as it&#39;s been since 2005, but unlike her previous appearance as a full droid her front sockets and colored tool panels are dark red instead of regular red.</p>

<p>They&#39;re both very nice. If you find Obi-Wan redundant, you can always repurpose his robes.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is straightforward and fun. There are some interesting complexities present, but nothing is likely to frustrate you about the build. You build the cockpit first, then one wing, then the other wing.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>LEGO frequently seeks to improve on their past versions of a set when they make a new version depicting the same basic thing, whether in terms of detail, construction, or both. In many ways this set succeeds. Aside from not including even one control lever and despite lacking landing gear, this set is leaps and bounds ahead of the original version of Obi-Wan&#39;s red interceptor from 7283. It has an actual astromech socket and a complete astromech droid, captures the details and the angles of the paint scheme more precisely, and the use of three hinge points in either wing keeps them more steady; they are a lot less likely to develop the floppiness the 7256/7283 design is prone to developing. It improves on that and 7661 via the revised cockpit piece, which can close securely without need for a 4x4 concave dish to be mounted in a specific way (the original version gripped studs very tightly, so trying to anchor it closed that way would result in things getting pulled off when it was opened), yet be opened easily, because it can click onto a 1x2 jumper plate.</p>

<p>It even improves on the more recent 75038 by enlarging the wings slightly to accommodate them angling back in toward the cockpit at the rear, the change to the cockpit cowlings&#39; shape, and having the pods under the wings concentrate their mass lengthwise (this elevates R4 higher in her socket than she is in the movie, but in the movie the astromechs are collapsing their legs to reduce their height so I&#39;m not going to knock the set for that). The use of several 4x4 &quot;L&quot; plates ensures the wings are very solid; they&#39;re not going to be prone to accidental breakage.</p>

<p>However, there is the aforementioned issue of no control levers, and the sticker error. Like 75038, this set makes the mistake of mounting the forward viewport in such a manner as to leave it free to spin around. And unlike 75038, this set does not make provision for storing Obi-Wan&#39;s lightsaber, which is a shame. It also could have used a 1x2 + 1x2 overset SNOT plate next to the fuel tank pod on the starboard wing, to provide a place to connect a refueling hose.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite the flaws, I rather like this set and consider it well worth getting (I even wan to get duplicates to redecorate with Asohka Tano and Adi Gallia in mind). It&#39;s much better than the only other version of Obi-Wan&#39;s red Jedi Interceptor and cheaper and easier to get, too. Grab one while they&#39;re still on the shelves, lest you get stuck paying a premium on eBay a year or so down the road.</p>
