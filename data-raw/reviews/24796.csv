<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mid range small kit box with a nice set image on the front. The Ugnaught is the figure of choice for 1:1 image on the top. The back has the &#39;holo tech spec&#39; of the set from above, close up on Fett&#39;s gun and several images showing the play features.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. Nothing particularly out of the ordinary in the assortment but lots of nice clear pieces, especially orange tiles and smooth discs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The kit comes with three figures but I&#39;d wish that they&#39;d skipped the Fett and just put in more Ugnaughts.<br />
Boba Fett is the same body as the 2012 9496 Desert Skiff but he&#39;s got the generic &#39;angry clone&#39; head which is a let down. The standard 4 visor and 4 rangefinder pack is included.<br />
The Han in Carbonite is nothing new but nice to have the dual sided head with frozen and worried expressions.&nbsp;<br />
Lastly we have the main reason I got this kit - the Ugnaught. A nice new head mould with some good detailing, especially around the eyes, this little creature is great. He has the shorter legs to keep the height right and the print of the coveralls on his body are nicely done.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 15 minutes. Nothing too complex but a few play features are built in to make the set interesting .<br />
With a lever on the side you can pull it out to make the carbonite chamber lower down. Sadly this does not lower all the way and just bends backwards. You can also rotate the chamber while it is in the lowered position.<br />
There is a lift platform on the right end which has a very simple &#39;pull lever up to lift&#39; mechanism on it. You then fold over the lever top to stop it going down.<br />
Inside on the left side you have a small chamber, almost added as an afterthought, with a fold down platform. This is supposed to represent the prison cell Han was placed in after Vader tortured him but it&#39;s not really that great and adds nothing to the overall set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model stands about 20 cm across from stair end to lift, 18 cm across from steps to edge, and 13 cm tall with the carbonite chamber mounted on the central lift.<br />
It&#39;s not a bad representation of the chamber but it is on the small side and only half complete. A few fun play features added for kids but adults may find the overall impression a bit of a letdown.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not a bad set but you get the feeling that the designer made a half-hearted attempt at the set. For twice the price they could&#39;ve done a lot better and at least made the full ring of the chamber instead of 4 of the 8 &#39;sides&#39;.<br />
As said, the bed feature seems an afterthought and it probably would&#39;ve been nicer if they&#39;d added some of the details from this with the functionality of the carbon freezing chamber of 2004&#39;s 10123 Cloud City playset which was much better.<br />
For me, this purchase was made simply because I&#39;m a completist and I love the Ugnaughts. I&#39;ll probably buy another to get another one of them and also to then rebuild the other half of the chamber.</p>

"Aragosta","2016-01-13T22:53:56.507Z","Could have been bigger...","<p>In my early 2016 Star Wars haul I decided to throw in this small set. There were several sets to pick from in this price range, such as <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75135"" target=""_blank"">Obi Wan&#39;s Jedi Interceptor</a>, the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75136"" target=""_blank"">Droid Escape Pod</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75138"" target=""_blank"">Hoth Attack</a>. So why did I pick this one in particular? Because the last few years of tracking down LEGO Star Wars sets has already given me an <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7749"" target=""_blank"">Echo Base</a> and a <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9490"" target=""_blank"">Droid Escape</a>. And while I don&#39;t have an older version of Obi Wan&#39;s spacecraft I did get roughly the same model in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9494"" target=""_blank"">Anakin&#39;s Jedi Interceptor</a>. So many rehashes in this wave, it&#39;s not funny!</p>

<p>But not this set. This is something new. I think LEGO must be testing the waters here to see if people want more Cloud City / Bespin sets. So I bought this in support of that. Also I should say I got a good deal on this. It was &euro; 26,50 which is about &euro; 8 off. I wouldn&#39;t have bought this at full price.</p>

<h3>Box and contents</h3>

<p>It&#39;s quite strange to see a menacing Kylo Ren over an Episode V set. It almost looks like they made a mistake, as if the people making the box art didn&#39;t know much about Star Wars. But it&#39;s the route LEGO has taken for years and how we can identify what sets came out at which time. Under Kylo&#39;s portrait we see the model presented on an orange and purple background to simulate the whole freezing chamber. This kind of stings me. The stuff in the background is what I would want to be in the set. This model is made up of the movie set it&#39;s trying to recreate. I&#39;ll whine some more on this in the overall opinion at the end of my review.</p>

<p>In the bottom right corner we see the minifigures that come in the set. The Ugnaught is highlighted with a bluish glow to indicate that he is a brand new figure. The backside of the box shows the playset&#39;s features. More on the minifigures and the features later in the review.</p>

<p><img alt=""Contents"" src=""http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b312/JohnnyRiff/LEGO75137/75137contents.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 280px;"" /></p>

<p>The box contains two bags of parts. Bag 1 has the new style of printing with the white stripe while bag 2 is in the older style with the number repeated several times in a vertical orientation (see photo). Bag 1 contains two sub-bags of smaller parts. Bag 2 contains three sub-bags. Two of which are for specific pieces, <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6004908"" target=""_blank"">Boba&#39;s antennae</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6034982"" target=""_blank"">Han in carbonite</a> while the third contains some smaller parts. There is also a small cardboard box which holds <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6124940"" target=""_blank"">Boba Fett&#39;s cape</a> and keeps it from getting creased. The instuction come printed in a single, double stapled instruction booklet which is 68 pages thick.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>To me, the best part of this set is <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6034982"" target=""_blank"">Han Solo in carbonite</a>. Other than that there&#39;s a few orange and translucent orange pieces, some black and of course, lots of light and dark bluish grey. It wouldn&#39;t be Star Wars without bluish grey! I&#39;m not a big &#39;parts guy&#39; so forgive me for not calling out all of the special parts that go into this model. I will say this though, this set makes excellent use of part <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6054852"" target=""_blank"">6054852</a>. This part allows for building at a 45&ordm; angle. A perfect solution to get around LEGO&#39;s regural building angles. In this case it creates (part of an) octagon.</p>

<p><img alt=""Spare parts"" src=""http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b312/JohnnyRiff/LEGO75137/75137parts.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 280px;"" /></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a picture of the parts that are left over after building the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The box shows there are four minifigures in the set. LEGO counts Han Solo in carbonite as a separate figure but I&#39;m categorizing it as a part instead of a figure. Here&#39;s a picture of all three together.</p>

<p><img alt=""Officer, arrest these criminals!"" src=""http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b312/JohnnyRiff/LEGO75137/75137minifigures.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>Boba Fett</strong><br />
A lot of people are going to want this set just for this figure. The only alternative to get Boba Fett at this time is the UCS <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75060"" target=""_blank"">Slave I</a>. The figure from that set is even better but at about seven times the cost. The figure we have here has the same printed torso (front and back), legs, cape, helmet and backpack as that one. The only exceptions are that this figure has no printing on the arms and he has the standard <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6021888"" target=""_blank"">Angry Clone Trooper</a> expression. A little disappointing but I really can&#39;t complain. With the helmet on and his cape worn over his left arm, all you&#39;re missing is the printing on his right arm. And who would spend &euro; 200 just to get that arm print? Boba also comes with his blaster, made out of the short gun that usually comes with Solo and a black lightsaber hilt.</p>

<p><strong>Ugnaught</strong> (Ugloste)<br />
This is LEGO&#39;s first Ugnaught, EVER! For a first attempt the Ugnaught is pretty good, but it&#39;s not without its faults. When looking at pictures of this character <a href=""http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Ugloste"" target=""_blank"">online</a>, you can see his nose should not be as high up on his face. His eyes should also be a bit smaller and further back in his head where they would be covered up more by his eyebrows and his large cranium. The shape of his head is also a bit too round I think.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that this is a bad figure, it&#39;s not! The Ugnaught must be a tough character to pull off with its crazy pigskin and thinning hair all over his face. It&#39;s just that he&#39;s so close to being just right... I hope LEGO will be able to perfect their design before coming out with a big Bespin set.</p>

<p>He does have a few nice details though, such as the mole on his chin, the bags under his eyes and the kind of see thru paint used for his facial hair. The printing on the body is nice as well. The Ugnaught is dressed in a blue coverall and he has short minifigure legs, which are appropriate.</p>

<p><strong>Han Solo</strong><br />
The same figure that came in the UCS <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75060"" target=""_blank"">Slave I</a> and an essential part of the scene! Han wears a white shirt which is in serious need of ironing. He has a double sided head with one expression like on the carbonite piece and the other looking like he&#39;s worried. For those who can remember the scene, it would have been nice if they could have printed an &quot;I know&quot; kind of face. I guess it&#39;s a bit much to ask though for LEGO to print a new head when they already have this one.</p>

<p><strong>More Ugnaughts? Vader? Lando? Stormies? Bespin guards?&nbsp;Leia? Chewie carrying 3PO?</strong><br />
Sadly, no. None of these are in the set...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Bag 1 starts with the Ugnaught which is only three pieces. It continues with the base of the freezing chamber, adds the lowering platform feature and finishes three sides of the octagonal shape. Like I&#39;ve mentioned before, it&#39;s a shame LEGO didn&#39;t make the entire ring from this scene. The set&#39;s main feature would have to be completely redesigned though, as it currently folds back where the other &#39;floorboards&#39; would be. Oh well, here&#39;s hoping this set will be redesigned some years down the road.</p>

<p><img alt=""Almost there"" src=""http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b312/JohnnyRiff/LEGO75137/75137bag1.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Bag 2 builds the remaining figures, the elevating platform, the control panel, a stairway and the Han in carbonite setup. The platform can be elevated by pulling on a lever on the right side. You can lock it at the top by folding the lever over the edge of the first floor. The stairway uses two pairs of stairs next to each other with some nice transparent orange detailing to give it that real carbon-freezing chamber feel!</p>

<p><img alt=""Voilà!"" src=""http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b312/JohnnyRiff/LEGO75137/75137bag2.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<h3>Completed model</h3>

<p>Should I beat this dead horse some more? Yes, I should. There is no &#39;completed model&#39;. This model is half finished. You could buy a second and create a full octagon. It&#39;s possible but you&#39;ll have to sacrifice the excellent feature of dropping fleshy human Han and have him come back up in frozen form. You&#39;ll also end up having two elevating platforms...</p>

<p><img alt=""Mr. Ughnaught demonstrates the Technic workings of the carbon-freezing principle"" src=""http://i22.photobucket.com/albums/b312/JohnnyRiff/LEGO75137/75137bag1mechanism.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Looking at the model for what it is however... Like the Ugnaught, it&#39;s a decent first attempt at a new part of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Star-Wars/subtheme-Episode-V"" target=""_blank"">Episode V</a> that hasn&#39;t really been explored before. I love the look of the set on the whole and the figures as well.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Cheap(ish) set</li>
	<li>Boba Fett</li>
	<li>Ugnaught</li>
	<li>Han in carbonite</li>
	<li>Cool feature &#39;turning&#39; Han into his frozen form</li>
	<li>Conveys the feel of the scene quite well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Not quite a home run on the Ugnaught</li>
	<li>Maybe a little difficult to build for small children (I didn&#39;t mention this in the review as I was watching the set thru my own eyes. But kids could have a hard time building this set. The inner edges of the &#39;floorboards&#39; are not really supported that well and could collapse under pressure. When you press down a figure on the studs for example.)</li>
	<li>Am I forgetting something... ? =P</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is much like a good piece of pie. Now that I&#39;ve had one I only want more! This set should have been the size of&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/9516-1/Jabba-s-Palace"" target=""_blank"">Jabba&#39;s Palace</a>. At that size LEGO could have offered a full circular platform with a redesigned carbon freezing feature and all the minifigures the set should have come with. The set is nice as it is, but it&#39;s just too small.</p>

<p>If this is your first time getting Boba Fett and Han in carbonite, it&#39;s worth it. If not, you could easily wait for a bigger, better release with more Ugnaughts.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>Now standard box and instructions, nothing to special, action shoots on the back, 1 book&nbsp;for the instructions, nice and compact and clear pictures at the back showing the playability of the set. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>231 pieces split into 2 bags, bulk of the build is from bag 2, plenty of grey with some good orange bits, some technic parts to help with the playability of the set no stickers in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>3 figures plus Han Solo frozen in carbonite. Boba Fett, Han Solo and an Ugnaught, the Ugnaught is a good addition to the set, shot blue legs, new head piece, New variations of Boba and Han</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>Not to complicated, you start with building the centre of the chamber, the part that lifts Han frozen in carbonite, using the technic parts, it&#39;s good the way you can lift the figure and spin,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model:</h3>

<p>A nice compact set with plenty of playability. The Han minifigure fits nicely in the frozen carbonite which really adds to the effect.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>i like this set I think its&nbsp;good value for money at &pound;20, my only criticism is, if you collect Star Wars Lego you are probably a big fan of the films as well, well I am anyway, this is such an iconic moment in the films, I&#39;d loved a Bespin version of Princess Liea, I think that could&#39;ve made this set even better,&nbsp;</p>

"Brickaddict221","2016-03-11T01:47:16.937Z","A bit disappointing...  ","<p>Cloud City is one of the most looked-over locations from Star Wars. Almost every Episode V set released, has been Hoth&nbsp;themed. When the name &quot;Carbon Freezing Chamber&quot; came up on the New Set Rumors, everyone got excited. Everyone imagined a Cloud City themed set after ages of nothing. Thoughts of a giant set with as many minifigures&nbsp;as ever. Then the images were released, and everyone was extremely disappointed. I was one of those disappointed people, but I decided to pick one up, just to make sure I wasn&#39;t missing out. Although I&#39;m still&nbsp;disappointed, it turned out to be a better set than I imagined.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75137-1/75137_alt1.jpg"" style=""height: 129px; width: 150px;"" /></p>

<p>The box is high-quality wth the 2015-2016 Kylo Ren banner at the top. It displays the set with a colorful background of the Carbon Freezing Chamber. The instructions were wrinkled, but that has become a normal problem with LEGO sets...</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set contains 231 pieces, and the majority of them are gray. There are also some black and orange pieces. It contains to stair pieces, and a printed tile with some Aurabesh&nbsp;writing on it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/sw710.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 200px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>The Ugnaught&nbsp;</strong>is a very nice figure. He has a new head mold, and some jean overalls with a dark grey shirt underneath. He has a beard, and big eyes. He has lots of wrinkles printed around his face. His white hair continues to the back of his head, where it gets a little longer. He is the first LEGO version of this species.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/sw714.jpg"" style=""height: 200px; width: 150px;"" /></p>

<p><b>Han Solo&nbsp;</b>is the third version of this character in this outfit. The only difference is the color of legs. He has a darker brown leg piece, instead of the usual brown. His torso is printed with a lot of different wrinkles and details. He has two faces, one with a worried look, and another with the in-carbonite face. He is a plain minifigure and, I would have much rather preferred Lando.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ml/sw711.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 200px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>Boba Fett&nbsp;</strong>is pretty much the same as he was in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75060-1/Slave-I"">75060 Slave I</a>.&nbsp;The only difference with this version&nbsp;is the lack of arm printing which were included in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75060-1/Slave-I"">75060</a>.&nbsp;He has a very detailed print of his custom Mandalorian armor. The helmet and jetpack are the same as always. His face is different from other versions, he has a generic angry clone face. I&#39;m fine with the face switch, since it&#39;s hidden from the helmet, and we actually never see his face in the films, but I am starting to get a little tired from the overuse of the angry clone head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75137-1/tn_75137_alt11_jpg.jpg"" /></p>

<p><strong>Han in Carbonite</strong>&nbsp;is also included. This piece has been used since 2010, and is nevertheless a very good mold. The details are very well done, and it has two pegs in the back for Han to&nbsp;hook in to. I do not see them redoing this piece in the near future, and honestly there is no reason to redo it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was quick but fun. The main feature was a interesting build, it is a very clever feature, I will talk about it more later.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75137-1/75137_alt2.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 123px;"" /></p>

<p>I think, although small, this is a pretty good representation of the scene from Empire Strikes Back.</p>

<p><img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75137-1/75137_alt4.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 143px;"" /></p>

<p>When you pull the axle in the front of the model, the Han in Carbonite piece retracts. When you spin the axle it rotates the Carbonite piece reveals Han inside. This is a neat, little feature and I think there is a lot of playability here. There is a clip that can hold the Carbonite piece.</p>

<p><img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75137-1/75137_alt3.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 124px;"" /></p>

<p>On the right side there is a simple &quot;elevator&quot; feature. It is quite simply a 4 by 4 plate that can be lifted up or brought down, and locked with a pin.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75137-1/75137_alt10.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 116px;"" /></p>

<p>On the left&nbsp;side, the section can be moved around a little, thanks to a hinge piece. Underneath there is a little bed that can fold in and out, by a axle.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75137-1/75137_alt7.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 119px;"" /></p>

<p>I think this may be trying to recreate the scene when Han has just gotten done being tortured and sits on the bed. Above this there is a little tile with some controls and the word LOCK written in Aurabesh. There are various transparent and opaque orange pieces replicating the orange lights.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/AdditionalImages/75137-1/75137_alt6.jpg"" style=""width: 150px; height: 146px;"" /></p>

<p>The staircase has a lot of orange pieces also. The staircase is made up of two black staircase pieces put together. At the end there is a little base, made out of grey plates.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/large/75137-1.jpg?201601050913"" style=""width: 150px; height: 144px;"" /></p>

<p>Overall I think this is a good set. Even though a lot of people were disappointed, it&#39;s still good for what it is. I wish they would have made the set a little bigger and included some minifigures such as Lando, Luke, Leia, and maybe Darth Vader. Cloud City is in for a good update, but this set isn&#39;t it. I hope this is just a teaser, like <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75138-1/Hoth-Attack"">75138 Hoth&nbsp;Attack</a>&nbsp;was for <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75098-1/Assault-on-Hoth"">75098 Assault on Hoth</a>. I hope we will soon get a UCS Cloud City set. The last Cloud City set released was back in 2003 with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10123-1/Cloud-City"">10123</a>. LEGO needs to turn they&#39;re attention to Empire Strikes Back. There has been a definite lack of Bespin and Dagobah sets. All in all I think this set could have been better, and included some more interesting minifigures, but it&#39;s alright for what it is.&nbsp;</p>

"MFT_Kyle","2016-04-03T01:08:28.407Z","One Half of a Would-be Perfect Set","<p>The Carbon-Freezing Chamber is arguably one of the most iconic locations in the Star Wars universe, and considering the set fought with a $25 budget and sub-250 piece count, 75137 represents the film to the best of its restricted ability. In certain regards, the set feels like a fraction of a full, dynamic set, but more on that below.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>One of the biggest selling points of the set is the prominence of trans-orange 2x1s, circular studs, and&nbsp;circular tiles. While it would have been nice to get a wider variety of the trans-orange pieces, the density of those three within the set&nbsp;(combining for a total of 36 pieces) is enough to keep most folks happy. I can include myself in that majority.</p>

<p>Outside of the aforementioned, very little drew me in from a piece-perspective. The inclusion of two black staircases is welcome when it comes to MOC-intentions, especially because&nbsp;SW is not generally the theme to look at when looking for great structure-building sets. While I&#39;m torn between considering Han&#39;s Carbon-Frozen Body as a piece or minifigure, it&#39;s nonetheless a pleasant addition for its rarity, particularly with&nbsp;its level of detail in this mold.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The strength&nbsp;of the set absolutely rests in its small but strong core of minifigures. My own purchase of the set was entirely influenced by the&nbsp;availability of Boba Fett in a small, affordable set, one that looks even better than 2012&#39;s Desert Skiff. With the choice between the visor or antenna on his helmet, he earns the spot of one of my favorite minifigures ever. Considering the legs, torso,&nbsp;jetpack, cape, head, helmet,&nbsp;helmet attachment, and blaster rifle, Boba clocks in at nine pieces for a single figure. And despite all that, he looks trim and tough with terrific detail throughout.</p>

<p>With so many Hans having been made, it&#39;s difficult to become particularly impressed with one, at least as far as my own interests are concerned. The two faces do deserve credit however, as the freezing face obviously has little reason to appear elsewhere. The smooth white shirt and brown pants play into his overall suave identity.</p>

<p>As the first images of this set hit the internet, it appeared that the inclusion of the Ugnaught is what grabbed the attention of most collectors. In versatile looking work clothes, and with a smoothly molded head paired with nice printing, Ugnaught ultimately deserves the attention it had initially warranted. While the small legs are generally a natural deterrent to me, no matter the source material, Ugnaught&#39;s little legs can be easily forgiven.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>While the exterior build matched my low expectations, the internal play features brought plenty to the build. Most specifically, the construction of Han&#39;s drop-and-turn function is a simple, but excellent example of what Lego&#39;s engineers can do with just a few pieces. Using a small number of technic pieces, and the particularly interesting piece #61903, Han&#39;s freezing and thawing is a fast and flawless feature that I find myself spinning everytime I walk past.</p>

<p>The other two fun features, the elevator and the lever beneath the Ugnaught, are great additions that add to the building experience and keep the process from being the mundane wall-building exercise that it very easily could have become.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The finished set is a fun and seemingly compact blend of features that offer a fair amount of play in a considerably small set. The lifting stairs, spinning Han, hidden lever beneath the control panel, and hold-and-release elevator bring a lot of extra life to what could otherwise be little but a vignette-style display piece. Additionally, the amount of exposed studs on the stairs and at top of the chamber offer a terrific number of pose and positioning options for the scene.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>The $25 price point&nbsp;offers a terrific value for pieces and minifigures, but I would have happily paid an extra $15 to have the chamber rounded out on all sides. The backside void forced a major setback in my overall opinion of the set, which is a shame considering its excellent collection of minifigures and its fun play figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said that, a second set and just a bit&nbsp;of innovation could easily solve the issue of its incomplete look, but that would essentially defeat the attractive value of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All things considered, from the spectacular Boba representation to the multiple play features, to that nagging sense of incompletion, it is still a set that I would be quick to recommend to any Star Wars fan. What it lacks in diverse piece offerings, it makes up for in the legendary image of Han&#39;s frozen body amid the Carbon Freezing Chamber.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know.&quot;</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a better scene which demonstrates Han Solo&#39;s status as a dashing rogue, I&#39;m not sure I can call myself a fan. So as I came across this set recently, I couldn&#39;t help myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given Empire&#39;s position as one of the (if not, the) best Star Wars films, I&#39;m surprised there&#39;s not more sets and that this one is not larger. It&#39;s a shame, but I&#39;m not disappointed with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s 231 parts in this set and that includes a good amount of orange pieces which ties in with the film, plenty of Technic parts and a variety of&nbsp;angled flats.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with four minifigures&nbsp;-</p>

<p><strong>Boba Fett</strong></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1520/25123411354_bfb346dae3.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; height: 250px;"" /></p>

<p>Another reviewer suggested Boba Fett might be the reason many people buy this set, and I must admit it did play a part in my decision. There&#39;s a lot of detail added to this figure, and I especially enjoy the extended blaster which is adds a lightsaber&nbsp;handle on the end of the gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Han Solo and Han Solo frozen</strong></p>

<p><strong><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1444/25127258813_41c0e9a190.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; height: 166px;"" /></strong></p>

<p>These two figures have a lot of detail, and the Solo figure comes with two expressions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the first new frozen Han Solo I&#39;ve bought, and the added effort is remarkable, especially given it used to be a printed column.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ugnaught</strong></p>

<p>This is a great addition to the set, but I couldn&#39;t help but feel another main character (such as Leia) would have made the set better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, now that I&#39;ve thought about it, it&#39;s clear that this set reflects the aftermath, where Solo is taken away, as opposed to the actual freezing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Construction is easy, and as a mid-size set it doesn&#39;t take a lot of time (it took me about half an hour) and it&#39;s easy to stop half way through and return.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s a good combination of Technic and regular Lego, which in my mind, really adds to the complexity of the build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1461/25658771801_4fe05d0382.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 361px;"" /></p>

<p>The final look is great, and to be honest, I was blown away with the staircase. It&#39;s simple&nbsp;but the orange &quot;lights&quot; is an exciting detail and really ties itself to the movie.</p>

<p>Some segments fold out to no doubt increase playability, however it&#39;s the freezing mechanism which really makes this a great set for a young Star Wars fan.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Overall opinion</span></p>

<p>This is a reasonably priced set which offers great value for money. The minifigures combined with a set which works great as a model and as a play&nbsp;set means I&#39;m satisfied with the purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: The box is fairly small, around the same size as the 2014 LEGO Snowspeeder. &nbsp;You have the play features/action sequences on the back of the box as usual. &nbsp;The instruction manual holds 64 pages of instructions excluding the ads on the back for LEGO Club and some app called the Force Builder App.&nbsp; Luckily, there is no sticker pack!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: &nbsp;The pieces are split into 2 bags for convenience. &nbsp;There are quite a few small Transparent Bright Orange pieces. &nbsp;Nothing too unique or new in this set except the new yellow Cross Axle 5M. &nbsp;The set includes 2 Staircase 7X4X6 which I find very lazy pieces and could have been replaced. &nbsp;There are a few leftover spare pieces and a bunch of visors for Boba Fett, which I don&#39;t think was needed because Boba Fett hardly ever wears visors in the movie. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: &nbsp;All of the minifigures are new this year and were probably introduced in this set! &nbsp;It comes with Han Solo, Boba Fett,&nbsp;an Ugnaught&nbsp;and a Han Solo in Carbonite piece. &nbsp;I wish they would&#39;ve included a Darth Vader figure, but the set is pretty small for 4 minifigures. &nbsp;Again, Boba Fett comes with 3 spare antennae and a few visors which he never wears in the movies.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: &nbsp;There were a couple of cool techniques used in the set, including the Technic mechanism for lowering/lifting and turning the platform Han Solo stands on. &nbsp;Overall the build lasted around 20-30 mins. &nbsp;I wish they would have removed the stair pieces for bricks or something because those are one of my least favorite pieces and I find it lazy building. &nbsp; Other than that, I liked the build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model: &nbsp;It&#39;s a good representation of the scene for 200 pieces. &nbsp;I like the play features, including the mechanism that lifts/lowers Han Solo in Carbonite. &nbsp;I was confused about the function&nbsp;found at the back that you can set Han Solo on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&quot;I have absolutely no idea what this is supposed to represent as all of the possibilities I have considered so far seem unlikely.&quot; -CapnRex101</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: I really like this set and I will put it on display in my room. &nbsp;I had barely any complaints about the set at all except for the strange function at the back. &nbsp;The minifigure selection found in this is totally worth it since the minifigs are new. &nbsp;I highly recommend this set to LEGO Star Wars fans!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Once again, it&#39;s a normal LEGO box. It displays the set in the front with data about itself whith the action features on the back. The border is the same as last year&#39;s &quot;<em>The&nbsp;Force Awakens</em>&quot; sets with it being primarily black. It also has Kylo Ren&#39;s hooded mask in the top-right corner with his lightsaber&nbsp;also showing. The instructions were easy to follow and had ads&nbsp;for the &quot;Force Builder&quot; app and LEGO Club.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing too mentionable. There&#39;s just two staircase pieces, Han Solo in carbonite, a black lightsaber hilt, a printed control panel piece and lots of trans-orange bar and studless-stud pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this, we get 3 exclusive minifigures!</p>

<h3>Han Solo&nbsp;</h3>

<p><img src=""http://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/sw714.png"" /></p>

<p>Han Solo has the same torso as his other carbonite&nbsp;variations had starting from 2010. But, this time around, he comes with his&nbsp;new face introduced in 2015 with&nbsp;the UCS &quot;<strong>Slave 1</strong>&quot;. Basically, nothing special but it does what it&#39;s supposed to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Boba Fett</h3>

<p><img alt=""75137-fett.png"" src=""http://images.brickimedia.org/thumb/3/36/75137-fett.png/250px-75137-fett.png"" /></p>

<p>Hey, remember that Boba Fett that came in the UCS &quot;<strong>Slave 1</strong>&quot; that you wanted but you couldn&#39;t afford him&nbsp;and you didn&#39;t want&nbsp;to get just the minifigure itself. Alas, in this set, the same Bo ... wait, he&#39;s basically the same figure but without his arm printing? Aw.</p>

<p>Yeah, he&#39;s&nbsp;almost the same Boba that I mentioned earlier&nbsp;comes in this set but without arm printing. But, hey, it&#39;s a $25 dollar set. What did you expect? Also, it&#39;s awesome to get Boba&nbsp;in a cheap set nowadays. So, I&#39;ll say it&#39;s a good deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Ugnaught</h3>

<p><img alt=""UGNAUGHTFIG"" src=""http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/lego/images/6/65/UGNAUGHTFIG.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20160322045647"" /></p>

<p>What&#39;s that I hear? It&#39;s a whole bunch of LEGO&nbsp;Star Wars fanboys (including myself) singing with triumphant praise! It&#39;s so awesome to have one of these pig-like aliens in a set. And a cheap one at that! His head is a detailed&nbsp;plastic mold (Allelula!) and has some&nbsp;nice printed overalls.</p>

<p>(Also, remember how he looked in the LEGO Star Wars videogame(s)?</p>

<p><img src=""http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/legovideogame/images/f/f2/Ugnaught.png/revision/latest?cb=20110528032635"" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m glad LEGO didn&#39;t have Traveller&#39;s&nbsp;Tales work on designing minifigures.)</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The build (Warning: Big Opinionated Part Here)</h3>

<p>The first part of the build I didn&#39;t enjoy. &quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; you may ask. It&#39;s because of the technic steps. I personally never cared for Technic so that part of the build was pretty meh. (Though, it&#39;s amazing what you can make happen with it.) That and a bit of repetition on the stairs kinda threw me off. Overall, the build was okay.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great ... from the front. Any other angle kind of&nbsp;ruins it. Most of the features&nbsp;are cool though. The &quot;freezing&quot; function is cool and works well for the most part. The elevator works well and is straight&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;point.</p>

<p>The only &quot;meh&quot; function is the little bed for Han to rest in after he gets tortured. Also, it&#39;s for him to rest up before being frozen ... maybe, I&#39;m not entirely sure on that point.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, the function in there is, get ready for it, lifting up the bed!</p>

<p>Mind blown!</p>

<p>Yeah, that&#39;s not entirely exciting but hey, the play functions are mostly just for the people who like playing with LEGO.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Yeah, this set totally deserves to be sitting on your shelf if your a Star Wars nerd or if you like LEGO or both! The play functions are neat little touches and the minifigures are outstanding!</p>

<p>So in conclusion:</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The price is awesome for this set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The minifigures are nice inclusions to an already amazing set.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>NO STICKERS!</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>A good amount of good pieces</p>
	</li>
	<li>Most play functions are cool</li>
</ul>

<h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>One play function is meh.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The build can get a bit bland and repetitive</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This set though, I feel gets overlooked, and that&#39;s a shame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes the action features are limited to the carbon freezing, and the elevator, but to me, that&#39;s&nbsp;not what this set if for. This set if for acting out iconic moments in the ESB.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the appropriate minifigs, you can have the whole Carbon Freezing scene play out, and even the begining of Luke&#39;s duel with Vader.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts in this set contain plenty of transparent orange pieces, and more difficult-to-find pieces. This set does come with some of the most popular characters, including Boba Fett&nbsp;and Han Solo. The carbonite piece is not a solid piece, rather a shell which&nbsp;han solo&nbsp;attaches to.</p>

<p><strong>Building</strong></p>

<p>The building of this set did feel rather slow due too how many transparent orange bricks there where, and I could easily see a child getting bored or confused by the technic parts.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to playability, this set strikes out of the ballpark. This set is not only cheap, but captures a very classic and nostalgic scene from Starwars, and does it very well. Using hte knob, you can pull down han solo, or push up the carbonite&nbsp;shell, the pulling down action is not directly down, but at an angle, somewhat disappointed on that part, but none the less still impressed with the function as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-06-09T06:32:46.453Z","Bad action feature","<p>This set represents one of the best and most iconic scenes from The Empire Strikes Back. The carbon-freezing mechanism is important to the set and unfortunately I don&rsquo;t think it is done well. I also don&rsquo;t like the choice of minifigures for this set, Han and the Ugnaught are both good inclusions but I don&#39;t think Boba Fett is as important to this scene as Leia. I would prefer this set to be bigger (and more expensive), it could include Han, Leia, Boba, and one or two Ugnaughts. The increased size would also solve some of my other problems with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Boba Fett: Though I don&rsquo;t think this is the best figure to include in this set, Boba is certainly the most detailed. The figures standard Mandalorian helmet has an antenna and a nice print. The angry clone face under the helmet is ok although an expression with stubble would be more appropriate. He wears a tan coloured cloth pauldron with an orange print over one shoulder which looks awesome. Although he has no arm print, his torso is well detailed with metallic silver highlights. Detailed legs with pockets, metallic gold and silver knee pads, and silver boot tips are well printed which is my favourite part of the figure. A blaster is included.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Han Solo: This is an older version of Han with the original hair piece. I don&rsquo;t think the hair represents the character well, but since then a more recent piece has been released that looks perfect. He has two expressions, a bewildered one with his mouth open, and one with his eyes and mouth closed. I think both expressions look appropriate and I like getting two. The torso is plain but appropriate with a rumpled white shirt, unfortunately the back of his torso is unprinted. Plain unprinted brown legs are a disappointment here. I don&rsquo;t particularly like this figure as I feel he needs more printing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ugnaught: This is the first set to include an Ugnaught which is great. The figure has a custom moulded head piece with a detailed print on it. Unfortunately the back of his head which shows his hair is left strangely unfinished. He wears blue overalls, a print that continues to the back of his torso. Short minifigure legs make the lack of leg printing understandable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Han Solo in Carbonite: I love this piece. The handles on the top and bottom can connect to other pieces. The reverse has two bars that clip to Han&rsquo;s hands, so he can be stored in Carbonite, which is a great idea. The sides are detailed with control panels and the front shows Han sticking out of the Carbonite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The set</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is built as a half circle around an action feature similar to the one included in Darth Vader&#39;s transformation. Whereas the feature was perfect for that set, here it works poorly. Ideally you&#39;d place Han on a platform, activate an action feature that would lower him straight down and raise the Han Solo in Carbonite piece/figure back up. Instead, you place the Han Solo in Carbonite piece facing the back. You then put Han in the Carbonite so he faces the front. The action feature then lays him backwards out of sight, (although you can still see him if you look from the top), spins the Carbonite around and raises him this time with the Carbonite facing the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While in theory this feature works, it certainly isn&rsquo;t movie accurate which definitely detracts from the set. The other major problem with the set is the decision to make it a half circle. In the movie, a complete circle surrounds the mechanism. The half that we do get however is nicely detailed. Stairs with orange highlights lead up to the platform and the circular shape is achieved nicely. A printed control panel is on one side of the circle and pipes detail the side. Another action feature is a lift. A minifigure can be placed on a smaller platform which can be moved up and locked in place. Turning the set around, a section of the set can be angled out to reveal a small space used as a folding bunk for Han.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think this set suffers from two major design flaws; the main action feature not being movie accurate, and the decision to only include half a platform. Boba Fett and the Ugnaught are both great minifigures but Han is lacking. The set is well detailed and the other smaller action features add playability. $45 aud is a reasonable price for a set this size but I would prefer it if the set was double the size and price. For the extra cost, it could include the whole platform, a better action feature, and either Leia, Vader, Chewbacca (with C-3PO on his back) or Stormtroopers.&nbsp;<br />

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-27T20:53:25.397Z","""We will test it... on Captain Solo.""","<p>In the early Star Wars Lego days my collection was slowly growing, and I have to admit I was hesitant about whether or not I wanted to add this set to it. On the one hand I really wanted to add Lego Boba Fett and Han in carbonite to the collection, but on the other I thought this set looked frankly a little bit dull. It was only when I saw an assembled model on display in a store that I changed my mind, as it definitely looks far, far better in person than the pictures do credit.<br />
<br />
So first of all, the build. This took me (a 34 year old) just under an hour to build, and there were no particularly complicated steps which might have foxed younger builders. Even the mechanism for the carbonite block was very straightforward. I should also point out that this build was surprisingly (and pleasantly) repetition free! I was expecting the tedium of building four identical sections to the chamber, but there was nothing of the sort, and as a result the build was extremely enjoyable. Next on the list of positives; there are NO stickers with this set! Many people seem to strongly dislike the stickers with the Star Wars kits, and this is one of the few I&#39;ve built (aside from the Microfighters mini-kits) with no stickers whatsoever.<br />
Once assembled it&#39;s a sturdy set for the most part, even though it doesn&#39;t really need to be, seeing as it&#39;s unlikely to be flying around the room amongst the X-Wings and TIE fighters. The mechanism to change Han into carbonite-Han is very clever - I found it far more entertaining than a grown man should, and I&#39;m sure kids will occupy themselves for hours with it!<br />
<br />
The minifigures are the crowning glory with this set. As mentioned earlier, you get a Boba Fett (you can remove his helmet, but why would you ever want to?!), Han Solo, Han in carbonite, and Ugnaut. Like with the Lego Jawas, Ugnaut is shorter than your standard Lego minifigures, but as a tradeoff for this his legs do not bend. Seeing as his entire job is to stand at the control console though, this doesn&#39;t really matter too much. Han comes with two facial expressions; &quot;Oh no, I&#39;m about to be frozen in carbonite&quot;, and &quot;Argh! I&#39;m being frozen in carbonite!&quot;, so if you want a heroic-looking Han for your collection then this definitely isn&#39;t the one you&#39;re after!<br />
<br />
There are only two negative points I&#39;d raise about this set. First of all it doesn&#39;t have many spares of the smallest parts compared to other sets, so be extra vigilant not to lose them to the hoover! Secondly, the elevator doesn&#39;t feel particularly sturdy when it&#39;s in the raised position, so it&#39;s probably best to avoid pushing figures down onto it whilst it&#39;s up.<br />
<br />
To summarise: A surprisingly fun, sticker-free and non-repetitive build. Fun to play with when finished, and a nice set of figures to go with it, including the cheapres way to pick up a Boba Fett. Just be gentle with the elevator and be careful not to lose the smaller parts!</p>
