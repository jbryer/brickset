"monkey_roo","2016-01-08T15:25:05.673Z","Asymmetrical Joy","<p>When this set was first revealed it looked odd, no one (myself included) could quite see what it was, maybe a variant of the B-wing, maybe not, but now we know, it&rsquo;s an alliance transport. Only briefly used in the movie Lego have captured the ships likeness perfectly and given us one of the most interesting builds for a SW ship of this size along the way.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>There isn&rsquo;t too much to say about the box, it is maybe a little larger than it needs to be, but the imagery on the front and rear is excellent and certainly helps capture the imagination.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>At 646 pieces it isn&rsquo;t the largest Force Awakens ship you will build (Poe&rsquo;s X-wing has 727, Ren&rsquo;s Shuttle has 1005 and the Falcon 1329) but it is an interesting build with several interesting parts. The titanium metallic blasters included look great and the very minimal use of four sand grey parts add an interesting colour to the top line. But for me the best part was the 2x4 SNOT part (6123809)</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>A lot is always made of the minifgs included with a SW set (or any <span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); line-height: 115%; font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 12pt; mso-fareast-font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;"">licenced </span>set these days) and once again Lego has done a great job here. The two resistance troopers are nicely detail although I have to say I find the overall effect of using the yellow tinted visors a little jarring, as at first glance it appears as though they are using traditional yellow heads rather than the flesh tones.</p>

<p>The main draw figure wise will be Princess Leia &ndash; or should I say General Leia and Admiral Ackbar (a Mon-Calamari who hasn&rsquo;t been promoted in 30 years it would seem).</p>

<p>The Leia figure is simple but nice. The torso printing is excellent and the plain legs look right with the model as do the head and hair (the head has printing on both sides).</p>

<p>For me the stand out figure is Admiral Ackbar the head printing is fantastic and captures his likeness perfectly. The torso is simply decorated but exactly right making him a perfect figure.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build is a simple but engaging one for such a small ship and this is achieved by the asymmetrical shape of the vessel meaning there are very few repetitive sections to complete. There are also some interesting parts to best of which is the cockpit opening mechanism but also some of the detailed finishing around the engines and the front guns (at least I assume they are guns).</p>

<p>One detractor from the build is the volume of stickers. I normally don&rsquo;t mind a sticker or two but there are a fair number here and where they have to be applied on the cockpit and surrounding area are a bit of a pain (there are three stickers alone for the canopy), so take care or the finish can look really odd and very noticeable. For an extra few &pound;&rsquo;s or so on the RRP I think Lego could have included some printed details here, especially the canopy.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Stickers aside (and assuming you can stick straight unlike me) the finished model is fantastic, the ship is interesting to look at with some good play features (three opening hinge sections, a pair of firing missiles and a cockpit opening mechanism). It is also a brilliant representation of the ship as it appears in the Force Awakens; it may even be the most accurate model to date from the film and fits perfectly with the Battle on Takodana set, which is where we first see the transporter.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is an almost perfect representation of the Troop Transporter. The build is simple but engaging and happily not repetitive. It is a shame that so many stickers were used to achieve the final look, but that is a minor gripe.</p>

<p>The four figures included are on more than up to Legos high standards and this is the only set with Leia and Ackbar included so if you like your OT figures this is a must have set.</p>

<p>Overall a great looking ship with good play features and figures.</p>

"BVA8007","2016-02-04T13:01:35.623Z","Let's get a cup of coffee","<p>With very little screen&nbsp;time&nbsp;this ship made it from the cinema&nbsp;to the LEGO universe. Let&#39;s find out if it ads something to this universe...</p>

<h3>Box &amp;&nbsp;Instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box shows the ship in all his glory. Also the four minifigures are shown in the right corner. Admiral Ackbar is the minifig of coise for the 1:1 comparison. The back of the box gives us a look inside the ship and that&#39;s&nbsp;pretty much it.</p>

<p>The box xontains&nbsp;5 numbered bags, 1 instruction booklet and 1 giant sticker sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts &amp;&nbsp;Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set contains a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of grey parts that are mostly seen before. However there are some new parts in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are only four minifigures, but they are all different. You&#39;ll get two Resistant Troopers, an older version of Princess Leia and an Admiral Ackbar minifigure. It seem that humans age faster than Calimari.</p>

<h3>The build &amp;&nbsp;The completed model</h3>

<p>Bag number 1 the two Resistance Troopers and the firts&nbsp;pieces for the centre&nbsp;of the model. The first nervous&nbsp;breakdown&nbsp;occurs during the placement of the 2 two giant stickers on the cylinder&nbsp;on the back of the ship. Bag number 2 doesn&#39;t contain any minifigures, so you&#39;ll continue&nbsp;building the ship. Right in the beginning you&#39;ll and up using&nbsp;some new parts and you&#39;ll experience some unique building techniques. Bag number 3, still no minifigures... Halfway this bag the centre of the ship is finished. Bag number 4 brings us the Admiral Ackbar&nbsp;minifigure and the pieces for the cockpit section. This is were the second nervous breakdown occurs. I really wish LEGO putted some effort in a printed windscreen.&nbsp;The engine and canon parts are in the last bag.</p>

<p>The completed model is quit big and very firmly build. The used building techniques and stickers&nbsp;really ad a great ammount&nbsp;of&nbsp;detail into the model.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The building experience is really fun! You&#39;ll end up building a nicely designed ship. But there aren&#39;t many play features. If you&#39;ll buy this set just for display you also will be a bit letdown. Unlike the B-wing (it reminds me a little&nbsp;bit&nbsp;of this set), there just aren&#39;t many ways to display this set. Whoever the lack of (dis)play features,&nbsp;the minifigures are a great add to anyones&#39; collection.</p>

<p>So overall... This is not the best ship in the universe and it uses a lot of dreadful stickers, it still is a nice build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2017-03-07T18:33:21.773Z","Good set but not for the price. ","<p><br />
<br />
I bought this set for $35.00 (Original price $70.00) on clearance. I would not have bought this set for it&#39;s original price.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instruction: </strong>The box was a nice size and it showed the features of the ship<strong> </strong>very well with the interior of the ship and it&#39;s many functions. The instructions&nbsp;manual was not in anything. The dimensions of the box are 48x28.2x6.1 cm. and weighed 0.92 kg (2.03 lbs) The manual was very big but not very thick. There were a lot of stickers in this set. I believe it is the most stickers I have ever had in just one set alone in all the Lego set I have bought. There are around 18-20 stickers in this set. They were not very difficult for me to apply but it does take a while to apply them all.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong>There are many unique pieces in this from the cockpit to engines to the inside of the ship. In the very back of the ship there is a big half cylinder grey piece similar to the piece used in the Droid Escape set. It is a very cool piece to get in this big of a set. Some other cool pieces are on the minifigures such as the resistance troopers helmets. The helmets are two pieces and I believe were used in this wave for the first time. The helmets can flip up so you can see the face or can be put down for combat. Also Admiral Ackbar&#39;s&nbsp;head was a very cool piece with so much detail put into and that it is a plastic head and not a rubber one like some other figures have.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>In this set you get 4 minifigures. You 2 resistance troopers with silver grey blasters, Princess Leia&nbsp;with a black pistol, and Admiral Ackbar with a black pistol and a clear cup. The resistance troopers both have dark grey pants with two different types of tan jackets. One has a normal tan jacket while the other has brown straps going down the sides of it. Next is Leia, this was a very nice minifig. to get in this set since it is the only older version of her made in Lego. She has a double sided face. She has a swampy green pants with a purple jacket. Her hair piece I believe has been used on older models of her before but instead of it being brown it is tan. Finally there is Admiral Ackbar. This is also a nice minifig. to get since he is not in many sets. He has brown pants with a little printing at the top of them, and comes in an orange uniform. In my opinion he is the best minifig in the set with such detail on his face and the rarity&nbsp;of the figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build: </strong>The set contains a total of 646 pieces. The build took me longer than expected (due to the stickers mainly) but overall it wasn&#39;t very hard. It took me about an hour or so to build the entire set. The hardest part of the build was when I had to attach&nbsp;the large grey cylinder to the rest of the ship. It would recommend taking your time on this part to delay a set back on the build. Other than that the rest of the ship came along just fine. The best part of the build for me was building the cockpit of the ship. To open the hatch to get into the cockpit they added a little thin light grey technic wheel to turn to open the glass to put the pilot in. This was a very nice feature. Other features include two spring loaded missiles, the top of the ship opens for easier accessability along with ramp in the front that comes down so the soldiers can go into battle. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong>Overall this is a good Star Wars The Force Awakens set. For the price of it though it should have included more minfigs. or have been bigger. There is plenty of space in the inside of the ship. The cockpit of the ship was done very well along with the cannon on ship was very nice to have on the ship &nbsp;as well. The engines in the back of the ship are some of the best I own and our done really well. Overall it is a very good ship.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong>Overall I wouldn&#39;t buy it unless you could get for under 60 dollars. It is not worth the orginal price of 70 dollars. Overall if you have a lot of Force Awakens sets but don&#39;t have this one yet I would recommend it getting for the right price. If you are just starting to buy Star Wars I wouldn&#39;t recommend buying this one as a starter. This would be a decent set for the average builder since it is not a hard set to build and is good if you are building a rebel army. &nbsp;Overall opinion for this set though is a 4 star rating for it.&nbsp;</p>

"Nuruodo","2016-05-06T22:14:16.47Z","More detailed than the movie one","<p>I was pretty uncertain about buying this set, since I surely preferred First Order Transporter; but when I saw it discounted, I acquired 75140 paying just 47,00&euro;. It was worth the price, and I can say it&#39;s one of the most surprising sets I&#39;ve bought.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box, of&nbsp;medium size, features the transport deploying its passengers on the battleground, making it pretty appealing in my opinion. On the rear you&#39;ll find playing features, that aren&#39;t so few. Instructions, written on a single book, are easy to follow, neither I forget pieces nor I&nbsp;assembled&nbsp;anything badly.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I found many rare parts in this set, and probably some of them are new. Very small parts are used instead of longer and bigger ones, creating an effect of an high level of detailing. Pieces are mostly light and dark grey, with a good presence of ocher bricks and some dark red ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In my opinion minifigures aren&#39;t that great. <strong>Resistance troopers</strong> can be found in several sets, and among them Resistance Battle Pack, which features three of them. However they are always nice minifigs, with good paintings and that strange helmet that I do like. <strong>Leia</strong> is a nice figure, with unusual wearing and a rare haircut (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s unique). She wasn&#39;t very important in Episode VII, so she isn&#39;t so appealing; the same can be said about <strong>Ackbar</strong>. He appears briefly in the movie, although it&#39;s very popular among fans. He has a simple but appreciable wearing, and a modified Mon Calamari&nbsp;head that is anyway a rare piece.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took about two hours. It was very nice to assemble this set, since as I already said it features many small pieces instead of bigger ones and this made the build particularly interesting. Every part is created with numerous passages; the cockpit, for example, took me about a quarter of hour, because it wasn&#39;t formed only by a seat and a screen. Every part has been made very complex and funny to build, and it&#39;s surely one of the biggest pros of this set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model isn&#39;t as impressive as an AT-AT or an X-wing starfighter, but it&#39;s very nice and unusual. It doesn&#39;t&nbsp;feature wings, and this is very rare for a Star Wars vehicles. The level of detailing is impressive, both outside and inside. The most beautiful parts to look at are surely the guns emplacement, the cockpit and the reactors; but the whole model is very nice to look at, &nbsp;no point excluded. Shooters are basically invisible, and I love this fact; their presence is reduced to the minimum.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&#39;ve to say that it was a very surprising purchase. I didn&#39;t expect to find a so detailed set, that nearly exceeds the original model. Although minifigures aren&#39;t that great, and although the transport appears briefly in Episode VII, it&#39;s worth not only what I paid, but the entire price too; and it must&nbsp;be considered that the price-for-piece ratio&nbsp;is very low.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; very high detailing</p>

<p>&ndash; interesting build with use of many small parts</p>

<p>&ndash; presence of several play features (without too many shooters) that didn&#39;t waste the set</p>

<p>&ndash; very good price-for-piece ratio</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; not so good minifigures</p>

<p>&ndash; brief appearance in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;</p>

"Max_Rebo","2016-08-01T10:27:34.227Z","Is it a trap?","<p>I got this set for 59euro,and I think this price is okay.</p>

<p>The normal price(69euro)is a bit too high.</p>

<p>Here are my pros&amp;cons:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>+Cockpit(the Cockpit-function works well and is pretty nice)</p>

<p>+Inside(there&#39;s more space,than I thought,you can put very &nbsp;easy all four minigures in this room.</p>

<p>+Shooting-Function(works good)</p>

<p>+Bricks(very nice tan- and rare bricks included)</p>

<p>Note:I can&#39;t give a pro for the minifigures,they are nice designed and all of them have a gun.The &nbsp;thing is,that I&#39;m missing C-3PO.With him it would be a big pro.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-No C-3PO</p>

<p>-Ramp could be better designed&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Too much stickers</p>

<p>-a bit overprized</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-08T03:32:45.163Z","I see your still wearing the same jacket","<p>The minifigures included are very cool and 1 of them is exclusive and that is Admiral Ackbar. The 2 resistance fighters are a fine addition to the collection as well so that you have troops to fill up the troop transport. It would have been nice to get one more resistance trooper but its ok that we didn&#39;t get another one included. The transport appears to be a modified B-Wing with a lot beefier mid section and no rotating cockpit. From what I have done, you can fit a good mount of troops in there with them having solid stud connections. It is a lot more roomy than I first thought. This is a very solid build that is very swoosh able and not very fragile at all. A downside though is that the cockpit has some hard stickers to put on it and that thee are a ton of stickers in this set, including 2 huge ones that you put on a cylinder piece on the back. I would highly recommend buying 1 or 2 of these if you like the resistance faction or the sequel trilogy.</p>

In the last two years I&#39;ve increased my old collection of Star Wars set, and I have to say that this Resistance Troop Transporter was&nbsp;the best experience, starting from the parts, the building techniques, the level of detail that you have both inside and outside the ship, and the final result which is totally satisfying. This is my first review here in Brickset, and I decided to write just because I&#39;ve enjoyed everything about this set!<br />
Just one note about the stickers: I don&#39;t love them, generally speaking, and in this set you have many stickers, sincerely, maybe too many, but in my humble opinion&nbsp;the great appearence of the completed model&nbsp;is achieved even with the &quot;help&quot; of the stickers.</p>
