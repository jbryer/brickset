"TK_1308","2015-12-31T18:05:15.9Z","""Stolen right out from under their nose!""","<p>More kits for your Rebels collection and a nice companion set to 2015&#39;s Ezra&#39;s Speeder Bike.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mid range small kit box with a nice set image on the front. Kanan Jarrus is the figure of choice for 1:1 image on the top. The back has the &#39;holo tech spec&#39; Speeder Bike and crates from several angles. The main picture shows Kanan raiding Imperial supplies. There is a picture of all the weapons included and images showing the crates and linkage systems.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The expected price per piece ratio for a kit of this size. A very nice selection of pieces and colours. There are also a couple of new 6x2 curved edged plates and a steering grip I haven&#39;t had before as well. There are two bags in the box. Bag 1 contains Kanan Jarrus, a Stormtrooper and Kanan&#39;s speeder bike. Bag 2 contains the Imperial Combat Driver and the Imperial arms cargo crates.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The kit come with 3 minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have the standard issue Snowtrooper. He comes equipped with a black blaster rifle. The head is the standard &#39;angry clone&#39; head.<br />
Next is Kanan Jarrus. This is the same as previous releases with the same double sides head with smiling and worried faces. He comes armed with his trusty lightsaber.<br />
Finally we have a new figure, an Imperial Combat Driver. Basically this is a grey version of 2015&#39;s AT-DP driver but nicer than the white ones in 75083. A welcome addition to the Rebels characters.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 15 minutes.&nbsp;<br />
Yes, there are stickers. There are 3 on the bike and the remaining 7 are for the crates. They are large and easy to apply.&nbsp;<br />
The bike, as hilariously oversized as Ezra&#39;s, is actually a nice piece with lots of detailing. The steering forks are well constructed, as is the mechanism for the forward steering flaps. There are moveable foot stands (obviously not usable) and aft flaps as well. The only quibble is that the forward fork angle is so steep that in order for Kanan to reach the control grips you have to tip the forks back too far.<br />
The crates are identical in structure and nicely made with durability in mind. They each have a hinge lid top and one is filled with rifles while the other contains thermal detonators. They could&#39;ve put another rack of the detonators in though, to fill the crate. A nice touch with the open and shut controls on the front.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Despite the laughable scale, when completed it&#39;s actually a nice set and a worthy addition to your Rebels collection. The bike is 14 cm long, 5 cm wide and 5.5 cm tall. The storage crates are 7 cm long, 5.5 cm wide and 4.5 cm tall. The bike is nicely detailed, more so than Ezra&#39;s from 2015.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A must have for a Rebels collection, even if it is only to get the Imperial Combat Driver. Great fun for kids as speeder bikes are great for &#39;driving&#39; around. I may get another one because you can never have enough weapons crates, or Combat Drivers for that matter.</p>

"Hylocera","2016-06-17T04:46:31.12Z","Too big, but too small","<p>I picked this set up for around $15 to get May the 4th promotions. I&#39;m still not too sure how I feel about it...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is standard LEGO fare, and much longer than it is wide. The instructions are heftier than I expected from a $20 set, but also pretty typical stuff. The next photo shows the contents of the box. Sorry for the iffy lighting. Still figuring out my setup.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7297/27619427872_9d71e1acda_c.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is a treasure trove of useful parts. The first photo shows interesting parts from the first bag; the second photo parts from the second.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7176/27619425212_2a6444336c_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The dark green round tile, triangular sign (same mold as on speeder bikes), are all new - or at least rare - in this color, as are the tan cone and green bracket. The dark grey technic thing is new to me, and I think this is a new color for the trans-clear wedge plate as well.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c7.staticflickr.com/8/7459/27441979350_a2fa776fa5_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Here, the thermal detonator, modified 2x3 plate w/ hinge, and round plate are only new to me, while the flat silver grill is a moderately rare piece. However, I have never seen a 3x3 plate anywhere before, so it is nice that this set includes 4 of them in light bley. Other notable parts include a whole lot of trans-clear tiles and brackets in various colors. Oh, before I forget: There are no round plates included to stand minifigs on. I was a bit confused by the official images showing these, as it would be an unprecedented move by TLG to include them.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Imperial Combat Driver is the only minfig unique to this set. I left out pictures of the 3 included figs (this one ^, Kanan, and the Rebels Stormtrooper) because there are no surprises beyond what official images reveal. I will say that Kanan Jarrus has a very nice hair piece in dark brown&nbsp;with a molded fishtailly (not a bun, and not quite a ponytail) thing on the back. <img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7578/27686095416_8d6027bff5_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The minifigs have relatively simple printing when compared with today&#39;s standards, but regardless there is impressive attention to detail, especially on the combat driver&#39;s printed light bley head. The stormtrooper&#39;s helmet seems to be the same mold as previous versions, but with a more stylized frown printed on the front, true to the show.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fairly straightforward; there are a lot of brackets and bricks with studs on the side to achieve impressive shapes and angles, but nothing we haven&#39;t seen before. I also have never known how much frustration forgetting a 1x2 plate can cause. It took me 20 minutes to realize that the ratios on the horizontal studs wasn&#39;t wrong, but rather I had left out a plate which would increase the height of the crates to properly mount the curved bricks on the sides. Anyway...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Other than the above error and photo breaks,&nbsp;the bike + crates took me around half an hour to finish. The first thing that stuck out to me is the absurd scale of Kanan&#39;s speeder bike.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c8.staticflickr.com/8/7421/27109550783_507e5b6334_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I mean, just look at this thing. The seat is as tall as Kanan himself, not to mention the handlebars which go even higher. Of course, this is absolutely not the first time scaling problems like this have happened. A few years ago, it was expected that every set you bought would be much bigger than actual minifig scale. Just look at AT-RT&#39;s and things like that. However, with the way TLG has recently been shrinking down its sets to a more accurate scale, this a pretty surprising and unexpected result.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c5.staticflickr.com/8/7458/27441977140_ab12d4b5c2_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The above reasoning, however, still&nbsp;doesn&#39;t make the speeder bike&#39;s size excusable. Normally I wouldn&#39;t mind so much, but in this case, Kanan Jarrus&#39; arms can&#39;t even reach the handlebars. He&#39;s leaning back a little in the picture above, but even with him pushed all the way forward, there is a noticeable gap between his hands and the bars. While the size wasn&#39;t necessarily disappointing, this is. I guess he can use the force to drive this thing...</p>

<p>On to the crates!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7342/27645571571_d739ab3d10_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>These are also ludicrously big, but size once again isn&#39;t the main issue here. These crates very cleverly use reversed 1x2 masonry bricks to texture the sides; barely visible on the left of the above picture (the reverse side of a masonry brick has an engraved line running through it). The crate lids are lovely, but on the hinge side, there is an unsightly gap between crate and lid. In the opened crate, the issue is pretty well hidden, but when closed, this section is just...ugly. Also,&nbsp;an orange sticker is used on each of the dark red 2x2 tiles to imitate the 1x2 orange tiles, something you can see in the official images, as I don&#39;t apply stickers to my sets. I&#39;m guessing TLG did this so that they wouldn&#39;t have to use a 1x2 red tile and another 1x2 orange tile, as it would make the lid less secure, but it is a very strange feature nonetheless.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c4.staticflickr.com/8/7443/27109548963_fda311deae_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>To close, how does this set compare to another set of the same price point? <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8632-1/Swamp-Raid"">8632 Swamp Raid</a>: 8 years old and 231 pieces, just 3 fewer than in this set. So why compare Kanan&#39;s Speeder Bike to an old set in an completely unrelated theme? Mainly because of the similar price point and piece count. What I&#39;m trying to say is, this set just feels...small. I&#39;m not sure what else to say. Swamp Raid was arguably a much less detailed set, but it felt substantial. It felt like 20 bucks. This feels like 10. It&#39;s just small. Even&nbsp;70601 <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70601-1/Sky-Shark"">Sky Shark</a>&nbsp;(221 pieces, $20) feels like 20 bucks worth of swooshiness. Just be aware that if (or when) you buy this set, there may be 231 parts, yes, which is fantastic value for money, but the end product is quite small. It&#39;s definitely more impressive in photos than in real life. Yet somehow it&#39;s still too big to be actually minifig scale...LEGO is weird. Anyway, to summarize: great figs, great parts, good value (parts:price), okay value for size, too big for Kanan.</p>

<p>Oh and the LEGO Force Awakens poster from May the 4th is absolutely amazing. If you missed out on it, you should definitely still try to pick one up.</p>

The price can&rsquo;t be beat for it as well, one of the great twenty-five dollar sets from LEGO Star Wars this year. I find myself wholeheartedly recommending it, it is a cheap method of obtaining Kanan and includes a very nice model.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Japanbuilder","2017-02-23T14:26:46.47Z","The Joben T-85 Speeder, only larger!","<p>For fans of Star Wars Rebels this set will be a delight to be sure. How does it measure up overall though? Let&#39;s take a peek.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Three minifigures are included in this set and their appeal will rest largely on how much of a fan of Rebels you are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get Kanan Jarrus, an Imperial Combat Driver and a Rebels styled Stormtrooper. All three figures have fantastic printing and Kanan sports a double sided face and a blue lightsaber. Though I find the Combat Driver to be the most interesting figure by far. He is clad in imperial grey and when compared to an AT-DP driver I must confess the Combat Driver just looks better.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was not very complicated. One manual is included with 2 bags. Bag 1 for the bike and bag 2 for the crates. The crates&nbsp;are identical so doubling every step is necessary when building those.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Looks fantastic, though much too bulky when compared to the Joben&nbsp;T-85 actually shown in the series. Kanan cannot reach the handles or the pedals and looks pretty silly riding it. Still the colors are dead on and the crates are well detailed. In addition to the crates, which bear the imperial insignia, there is a palette for holding 4 regular moulded blasters and thermal detonators.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[url=https://flic.kr/p/R6De5L][img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/3/2069/32225327264_afeb6c904e.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/R6De5L]P2232669[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/139708441@N07/]Macster Tome[/url], on Flickr</p>

<p>The blasters are very welcome as they will allow you to replace stud shooters on other sets. In addition the palette holding those blasters can also hold stud shooters and the second crate is large enough to hold not just the thermal detonators but also any spare studs. So this makes the set quite versatile.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Though the speeder is much too large, the overall play value and the figures along with their accessories make this set a great buy. In most regions the set is reasonably priced and is not that big so it can also make for a wonderful gift to any fan of Rebels who may be in need of a Kanan figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great set, great play value, and best of all very useful in tandem with other sets or just for general Star Wars fun.&nbsp;</p>
