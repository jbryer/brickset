"noaches2121","2016-01-11T01:29:48.477Z","Amazing!","<p>Ok. This little set had caught my eye from the moment it was released. I love the other planes and how it fits in with the rest of the lineup. I bought it in the LEGO Store in Westfarms mall in Connecticut.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is the smallest I&#39;ve ever seen in the Technic lineup, and it is absolutely jam-packed. 2 bags, instructions for the A and B model, and 3 large technic beams really stuffs the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has quite possibly the largest amount of white panels in one set, particularly when that set has 113 parts. It adds a lot of valuable panels to anyone&#39;s collection. The white panels will make people very very hot for this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was an average build. There was nothing unique about it except for the way that they attach the rear panels that serve as elevators.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s really remarkable how LEGO crams a function into the fuselage of a tiny little plane. It is really fun to watch how the gear retracts and there&#39;s even a gear locking system (though it doesn&#39;t work amazingly well). The colors work well together.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is easily my favorite set under ~200 pieces. It does so much in a really small little kit. The gear retracting system is ingenious and if you look at it the right way the part of the landing gear that juts into the cockpit can be seen as controls! The plane easily holds its own in the current Technic lineup of planes. All we need now is a green plane to complete the Technic fleet!</p>

"PicnicBasketSam","2016-09-24T22:15:50.673Z","Could have been a bit bigger...","<p>Hello everybody! PicnicBasketSam here, after a long hiatus, because I&#39;ve finally gotten some new stuff. Today I&#39;m reviewing a small Technic set that came out 9 months ago, and I know that anybody reading this has already gotten it or decided they didn&#39;t want it. But let&#39;s find out if it is worth it... oh, wait. You already read the sliders off to the side, didn&#39;t you. Let me rephrase that: Let&#39;s find out <em>why </em>it&#39;s worth it!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Pretty average here. Small box, shows the plane as much smaller than it really is, which might be a bit of a disadvantage... the parts came in two bags. The instructions come in 2 booklets, one for each model, and they were both folded completely in half. This was inconvenient, and another reason why they should have gone with a bigger box. Instructions themselves are fine, although I would suggest the app if possible rather than working from heavily creased booklets. Also included is a gigantic sticker sheet, which is one of my biggest problems with this: Applying 10 stickers to curved surfaces of varying sizes is no easy task, and is more than I would entrust a 7-year-old to do properly.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not really up-to-date with Technic pieces, but there&#39;s a nice heap of white panels here, a steering linkage, and a couple of 6M soft axles, which are my first. Not sure what I&#39;m going to use them for, but I&#39;ll probably think of something.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was short and sweet, about 15 minutes. My little brother, who technically recieved it, had a lot of trouble building it and eventually gave up- it&#39;s a great toy, but keep this in mind if buying for a young child. The soft axles were quite stiff and putting on the second one was a bit tricky.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model completely dwarfs its box, quite impressive for only about 110 pieces, but has several huge gaps in it. It&#39;s mostly a couple of triangles with panels added on and a function in the bottom, and here&#39;s the other issue: There is only one moving part, the landing gear. While that works fine, and the locking feature is rather clever, nothing else is moveable at all. This is kind of disappointing, last year&#39;s similarly sized/priced set had more going on. It also doesn&#39;t look especially good, taking up all the space inside... a minifig can fit in that cockpit, but only with landing gear deployed. However, it&#39;s incredibly swooshable... it&#39;s really light, so sturdy you can pick it up from literally anywhere or chuck it across the room undamaged, and it&#39;s small enough to be easily handled by a 7-year-old. So as a plane, it&#39;s a better toy than most City planes because a toddler could throw it and nothing would break.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this should have been bigger. Had they upscaled it&nbsp;a bit to the $20 or $30 slot, they could have filled out the body more and added details and functions. As it is though, it&#39;s got great pieces, it&#39;s bigger than anything else for this price point, and as a toy plane it&#39;s absolutely brilliant.</p>
