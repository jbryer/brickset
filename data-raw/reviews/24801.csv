Even the simplest of sets can be fun, and now my son (only 5 years old)&nbsp;is showing huge interest in Technic already these cheaper sets are a great intro for him.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Small box, not packed full either, but the piece count is not high. The box is the size it is to accommodate the instructions rather than anything else. Usual decent quality instructions as found in most Technic sets, excluding the big headline sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Surprisingly a really nice mix of pieces here including two of the newer panel pieces in blue which are new to this set. A nice select of white panels too, a couple of the shortest flexible axles and a variety of regular parts make this set a pretty good pieces donor.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None, because Technic!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Unlike a lot of Technic builds, this one starts off with the engine assembly and then builds off from that, rather than constructing a chassis of sorts to drop an engine into.</p>

<p>A couple of thin wheels under the racer provide some friction to turn a gear mechanism that in turn runs the engine. It grips even the most smoothest&nbsp;of surfaces meaning the one and only moveable feature&nbsp;always works when swooshing it about on the floor.</p>

<p>Nothing difficult in this build, except getting the stickers on the two larger white panels each side to line up with a sticker placed on a beam. I&#39;d recommend building the side sections fully before applying any stickers. Expect a total build time of around 15 mins.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The racer looks good, although this is largely helped by stickers. Folks who choose not to apply them may be a bit disappointed by the overall look without. The racer is pretty close to the subject matter - unlimited class hydroplane racing boats, Lego have done a fair job for the scale and parts count.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A good little model, limited in playability but worth every penny asked of you to procure one. A nice introduction to gears and transferring motion from one axis to another - an ideal model for new comers to Technic to learn the basics.</p>
