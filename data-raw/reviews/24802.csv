"princeofgonville","2015-12-30T22:13:31.263Z","Fun stylish car with pull-back motor","<p>Great set&nbsp;for the target age-range as an introduction to building with LEGO&nbsp;Technic, with the bonus of having &quot;drive-ability&quot; once built. For the adult fan, it is just as much fun, and is a useful source of basic Technic parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I built this set using&nbsp;my own parts,&nbsp;from the instructions provided by LEGO online, so cannot comment on the box. The (online)&nbsp;instructions&nbsp;are easy to follow, are suitable for the target age range upwards,&nbsp;and are clearly laid out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set contains 170 parts from the Technic range: a good selection of beams (&quot;liftarms&quot;), pins, axles and connectors. There are also six panel pieces which are used to form the shape of the bonnet and sides.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build strategy follows many smaller Technic models: start with one side of the lower chassis, then add&nbsp;the pullback motor as part of the structure. There is some interesting geometry of parts at the front which make for a mostly&nbsp;solid vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The roof is only attached at the back, and can move&nbsp;slightly relative to the dashboard bar (where the&nbsp;steering wheel attached). The main front-to-back structure of the car is formed of only two long beams, and the whole car can flex slightly. This is not a problem in practice, and the overall feel is of a solid vehicle that could stand up to&nbsp;being dropped.</p>

<p>The shape and&nbsp;styling of this car is excellent - it is immediately recognisable as a hot-rod, and the stickers really help the theme (though without stickers, the shape of the car is just as good). The &nbsp;choice of colours works well, and the pull-back motor is well hidden in the back of the car.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This car was fun to build&nbsp;and fun to drive too. If you are considering buying this as a present for a Lego fan who likes cars, this is a good choice. It shouldn&#39;t frustrate younger Technic builders, it has an aesthetic&nbsp;look to it, and it has the after-build bonus of being race-ready with that pull-back motor built into the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets take a look at the box:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box has the vehicle and it shows the pull-back feature. Not that interesting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets look at the build:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car looks very good! i like the design and all of the fire stickers. The play function is cool! I love it! If you pull the car back and let it go, it&#39;s gonna go pretty far. Works better than Pull-back toys nowadays. It looks very good on display, too. It can also combine with the Police Interceptor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion on this set:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love it. Its very good, both to play with and for display. I recommend it for everyone.</p>
