They offer 2 different pullback racers, which can be combined following an online PDF manual into one supersize racer.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve built them all, except for the Getaway racer and the 2016 combined model.</p>

<h3>Unboxing</h3>

<p>The unboxing is similar to earlier entries of the series. Same size box, similar manual. The only difference is that this package feels a little heavier. This one packs 185 pieces, a record for the series! When you open it you will find a little more liftarms than usual for these sets: 31. The other 2016 racer has only 20.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As said before, with the 42047 Police interceptor you get a bit more bricks than usual. The price of the pullback racers went up 0,50&euro; this year, but you get fuller packed boxes. So the price/fun ratio remains great. What I like about this model is that you get a good selection of pieces. Nice variation in colour, yet not to weird stuff. It easily combines with other technic. Last years record breaker for example had more weird pieces in unusual colours.</p>

<p>Special parts in this set are the 4 lime green rims. It is the 10th colour LEGO uses for this rim mould. The nice set of white liftarms is a good addition to any starter set of technic pieces.</p>

<h3>The built</h3>

<p>The youngest, 4 year old, built this. Small Technic sets are ideal for young kids. I think they are even better suited for 4 year olds than typical small Lego City models. Easier to build yet better testing their spatial aptitude. Also the finished models are better capable to deal with their play.</p>

<h3>The looks</h3>

<p>We really love this one. It is kind of an angular SUV, looking a bit like a Range Rover Evoque or Mitsubishi Outlander. The fresh white works really well with the bright coloured accents: the red and blue flashing lights, the green bull bar and the green rims. It is nice LEGO put black discs in the rims, reducing a full green rim to nice green rings. I would put this second in looks after the Black Champion Racer, my favourite of the series.</p>

<p>We never apply stickers, and this is one of the few models that looks a bit naked without. Nothing too bad though.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Because of the fairly higher weight this racer goes a little slower than the Black Champion Racer. That one is champion for a reason of course. What works well is the type of rims. On the Black Champion Racer you have to use the tires of this model to replace the included ones as they have to little grip. These tires and the small balloon tires from the 42010 Off-road Racer are best suited for the pullback motor.</p>

<p>The model is very sturdy. It can easily bump into obstacles without loosing a single piece. The blue lights on the bumper are easiest to loose. Be careful for them!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This Police Interceptor is a runner up in the series. It offers the biggest amount of pieces in a pullback racer set ever, many of them in nice colour generic pieces. It is a nice addition of bricks for a Technic starter. The playability is great, although it won&#39;t catch the Getaway Racer as this one is heavier! You can easily fix this by getting a second Interceptor and sandwich the Getaway Racer. You won&#39;t go wrong having two.</p>

"platinumDalek","2016-10-19T02:19:28.283Z","Fun for everyone","<p>I am extremely impressed with this set. Its pullback moter is very strong and the car is the most durable set I have ever had. This thing will slam into a wall giong full speed and nothing will pop off. Rarely the blue lights on the front will pop off.</p>

<p>This set was easy to build.</p>

<p>My two daughters (3 and 5) enjoy playing with this too.</p>

<p>The only complaint is that the beam the tires are attached too can slide around a bit easily. There should have been caps put on the outside of the tires to hold it in place better (I added this manually with spare Legos).</p>

<p>I also have the black Getaway Racer model that this one can combine with. It is also good but&nbsp; more fragile. Several pieces (sides, peices on the front, etc) can popoff during the inevitable crash. The speed of this&nbsp;is about the same or the police car is a bit faster (I raced them several times).</p>

"sct","2020-08-04T12:49:20.413Z","Nice car and a great entry set ","<p>The&nbsp;42047-1: Police Interceptor is a quite small, relatively simple to build set. I can recommend to anyone who wants to start one&#39;s adventure with lego technic - or anyone who wants an affordable technics car.</p>

<p>It has one very strong advantage: it&#39;s nearly indestructible:)&nbsp;Apart from the front blue lights that do pop out sometimes, this set can survive almost any crash without bricks disconnecting. That makes it great for KFOLs - even for the youngest ones around 3-4 YO (not to build, but to play with).</p>

<p>The build is pretty quick&nbsp;but enjoyable. There aren&#39;t many parts, but they are mostly &quot;standard&quot; bricks, so they are reusable.</p>

<p>It is a pull-back model and apart from that it has only one movable part, the lights on top can be tilted to the front.</p>

<p>This model has no disadvantages in my opinion, looks good, is nice to play with and does not break easily. Hence the recommendation and 5/5 with overall rating.</p>
