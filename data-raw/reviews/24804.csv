I am a big fan of karting&nbsp;and thus&nbsp;was very interested to find out how Lego would translate this hobby of mine into plastic bricks. If you&#39;re interested as well, read on :)</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>Lego usually makes the set look prettier on the box than it actually is, but with this set this was&nbsp;not the case: the model on the box just looks boring. The kart is shown from a&nbsp;weird angle&nbsp;which causes the kart to look like his smaller sister&nbsp;that has&nbsp;cute&nbsp;treadles, even though it is placed on the starting grid of what looks like the hefty Nurburgring.</p>

<p>In the lower right&nbsp;corner of the box is a small detail placed of the back&nbsp;of the kart: it shows the moving yellow piston inside the motor compartment.</p>

<p>The back of the box shows the B-Model, a track car.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set has a good price/piece ratio: 8.7c/7.2p. The set offers a nice selection of parts: some long beams and especially the tires are nice: they are very sleek and slim. Look very fast. The orange parts are nice to have. The 3x13&nbsp;curved&nbsp;panels were introduced in 2015 with the 24H Le Mans Race Car. In this set you get 4 of&nbsp;those in purple which is very nice, since these are unique to this set. Furthermore you get 2 dark bluish grey 3x11&nbsp;technic&nbsp;panels which will make up the floor of the kart. These are also unique to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As always with Lego Technic, during&nbsp;the first steps&nbsp;you have no idea&nbsp;what you are actually&nbsp;building. But then when you see it, you love it. I personally enjoyed building&nbsp;the engine the most. So many gears which will eventually be combined to create a most perfect small gearbox. Just lovely.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is where I will express my true opinion. I am in love.&nbsp;This set&nbsp;completely captures the feeling of a fierce, schreeching 150cc kart. As I said before, I love to kart and even looking at this set just injects&nbsp;burning rubber in my mind and makes me want to kick the gas and go full throttle through a tight corner, except for the fact that this kart will&nbsp;not be able to make that corner.</p>

<p>And that is the only sad thing about this kart. The steering wheel steers&nbsp;the wheels, but it is fixed so it simply can&#39;t make a sharp turn...</p>

<p>But despite this, this&nbsp;kart is still the best kart&nbsp;Lego has ever made. But why?&nbsp;</p>

<p>- It captures the looks of a real kart very, very, very good.</p>

<p>- The proportions are perfect. You can picture yourself sitting in that orange seat.</p>

<p>- The inclusion of a gearbox to change gear is what makes the set interesting.&nbsp;The red lever next to the seat&nbsp;is connected via a beam to a long black &#39;steering gear&#39; part, which allows you by pressing or raising the red lever to change gear. This&nbsp;changes the ratio in which the yellow piston moves during drive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- The set has nice details. The moving brake/gas pedals. The complete engine on the back&nbsp;with even a gas tank. The red lever.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you like karting just like me, you will recognize that this Lego version&nbsp;just completely makes sense. The kart looks great as a display piece, even without the stickers.&nbsp;The addition of a gearbox&nbsp;just makes this set more than a model. It makes it a working model, which reshapes my view upon this model to be crystal clear&nbsp;perfect.</p>

<p>If you fell in love like me, just buy it. You will never need a woman/man in your life. I promise.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>PS forgive me for not mentioning the B-model, I just can&#39;t stand the idea of taking apart my little karty.</p>

"martiniman","2016-01-13T14:25:39.17Z","Much cuter than expected, tad expensive","<p>We just ordered 4 purple panels and started building with the online instructions. Set is hard to find yet, and seems a bit expensive at 30&euro;.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions are very easy to follow. They are 5-year-old proof, as with most Lego Technic sets today (even the Arocs one is 5-year-old proof).</p>

<p><img alt=""Overview"" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42048-1.jpg"" style=""width: 1200px; height: 798px;"" /></p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are MANY parts in this set. The designer went a totally new direction with the construction of this set. So it seems you get bang for the buck, but fact is you get many many tiny parts. Take for example the Single Bush 2M piece:</p>

<p><img alt=""Single bush 2M"" src=""http://cache.lego.com/media/bricks/5/2/6073231.jpg"" style=""width: 192px; height: 192px;"" /></p>

<p>Never contained a Technic set so many of these. Here they use 25!</p>

<p>Another thing that puzzles us is the use of yellow and red axles. It is a 2016 trend to use them, but the reality is they are put away in invisible places. No idea why grey does not work here.</p>

<p>Besides the 4 purple panels, and 2 dark grey 3x11 panels, there is not much new here. I dislike the 2016 trend of using weird colours. Lego please increase the catalog of primary colours for Technic, instead of adding new ones.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set demands a Technic Action Figure! I have to dig them up from the attic.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is nice with very little repetition. There is a lot of colour here. The kart has nice little coloured details everywhere. Take for example the bright-white 3-m coupling bushes, they are used in the bottom frame. Or the orange 2M liftarm that functions as steering mech.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The cart feels very nice and is very cute looking. You can easily replace the purple panels with the bright green 24-hours 42039 ones, and the cart looks equally great or maybe even a tad better. It will make a nice set: one green and one purple one to play little races. As always, the stickers don&#39;t deliver anything at all. Keep this one clean, this one is really colourful by default.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42048-2.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Playing with the cart is limited. It is nice that LEGO tried a gearbox on this one. You can choose 2 speeds of gearing, and it alters the speed of the cylinder in the engine. The mech is done nicely.</p>

<p>The steering is not the best. The mech is creative, but a bit flimsy, and the range is very narrow. It might be accurate for a kart, but it limits playability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The Race Kart is the best Technic Kart by LEGO ever. The shape looks realistic, the proportions are right and it is very nice to see more tech than just a cylinder and steering. The shifting gear really ads something new. And the new way of constructing, with lots of little rainbow coloured items in a black/grey base is very cheerful, refreshing and good looking.</p>

<p>The bad side is the price. Lego seems to go through the roof with 2016 pricing. All sets seem to receive a 20% price increase compared to similar size models last years. This set should cost like 20-22&euro;, not 30&euro;. I don&#39;t agree with the other review that states the price per brick is low. It is very logical: this set contains smaller pieces than usual, half the pieces are for example bushes and pins. Maybe we should introduce a new metric: price per kg of bricks!</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2017-07-16T00:00:29.16Z","Great Small Set for its Value","<p>When I first came across this set I thought to myself, &quot;Oh gee, another small Technic set which probably won&#39;t have much to it.&quot; Was I ever wrong. Upon closer scrutiny, my perspective shifted 180 which moved&nbsp;this set from my &quot;ignore&quot; list to the &quot;should get&quot; list. Let&#39;s find out why.</p>

<p>Building time was not more than 2 hours and it was fairly typical. Some steps, however, do squeeze in a lot of pieces so it can be easy to get lost. I made the rookie mistake of building the B-model instead of A only to realize my mistake about 30-40 minutes in.</p>

<p>The kart features two major functions: steering and a working one-stroke engine. Steering is accomplished via the live steering wheel in the cockpit. It uses an orange 2L beam with pin and axle hole as a paddle which pushes against 1L beams mounted on the live arm directly underneath, moving it in left and right directions. The engine is powered by a universal rear&nbsp;axle and has two speeds plus neutral, which is controlled by the red lever to the left of the seat. There is no suspension, but that is well-expected considering a set of this size and the fact that it&#39;s a go-kart.</p>

<p>The turning radius is not very tight and fares worse off than even some of the larger vehicles I own. The short length of the steering paddle means that its motion must be restricted otherwise it will overshoot and lose contact with the 1L beams which it uses to push against.&nbsp;As pointed out <a href=""http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/119811-42048-race-kart-mods-and-improvements/"">here</a>, a conventional&nbsp;steering rack and gear system probably would have worked better.&nbsp;Nonetheless, the motion of the steering wheel itself is very smooth and tactile.</p>

<p>The meat and potatoes for me was the gearbox. To be honest, I wouldn&#39;t have given this set a second thought if the gearbox wasn&#39;t present. Fitting one in a set of this size was therefore that much more impressive to me since this is my first gearbox-engine set. The system&nbsp;uses a 9L linkage arm to connect the red lever to the shifting paddle at the rear of the vehicle. The down position is gear 1 (faster piston movement)&nbsp;and up is gear 2 (slower piston movement) while in between is neutral (not connected to engine). <strong>To the best of my knowledge, this is the smallest Technic set which has a gearbox&nbsp;used for&nbsp;engine transmission.</strong></p>

<p>The combination of purple and orange is very eye-catching while the panels give the kart a sleek finish. Non-technical details include dummy gas and brake pedals, exhaust pipe and muffler, and gas tank. As opposed to leaving a huge gaping hole in the space between the chair and adjacent panels, there are 2 3x11&nbsp;dark grey panels which nicely add a floor to the vehicle. In my opinion, the seat is very attractive which they nailed spot on.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a great set considering the functions you get for its value and acts as a great introduction to basic car mechanics. It is an example which shows that you don&#39;t need to pay hundreds of dollars for large supercars&nbsp;to fully appreciate some of the elementary functions.</p>

"spaznleroy","2017-02-07T03:08:12.713Z","Compact Kart with lots of Go","<p>For as long as I&#39;ve been in Lego, Technic&nbsp;specifically, I&#39;ve somehow never owned a go-kart, Technic or otherwise. When this set came along I decided to rectify that matter, and am very glad I did.</p>

<p>The build experience is excellent, nothing challenging, but plenty&nbsp;of the usual Technic nuances that make you say &quot;Ohh, that&#39;s clever!&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very impressed with the design (from an engineering standpoint as well as an aesthetical&nbsp;one) as the designer did a few&nbsp;things in a somewhat&nbsp;unusual fashion. First of all is the steering, which is not rack and pinion, second is the seat, which makes excellent use of panels to give it a real racing seat look, and thirdly is the gear shift mechanism which is an exquisite thing to find on a $30 set.</p>

<p>As far as looks go, I love the color combination, and how it extends to the stickers. Of course, this bit is the most &#39;to each their own&#39; but I&#39;m all about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely pleased&nbsp;that they were able to not only give us a new go kart, but to give us one that does more than roll and steer with an &#39;engine&#39;. This is a departure from karts of past and a job well done.</p>

<p>My one issue with this set is in the playability: the turning radius of this thing is terrible for an 18-Wheeler, let alone a go kart. Not sure how they missed that one.</p>

<p>Overall, a fantastic set, and a fantastic set for the price point, I highly recommend before it becomes in short supply!</p>

"Matthias_K","2017-06-28T00:32:31.477Z","History does not always repeat itself","<p>Technic race kart sets have traditionally been one of the most uninteresting sets&nbsp;in terms of functions. Only small motorcycles and quads are consistently&nbsp;worse. I suspect that&#39;s why the designer of this set went a little bigger and a whole lot nuttier with his design to create something unique.</p>

<p>The result is a very good looking kart with a working gear box next to the expected&nbsp;fake engine and the&nbsp;(in this case somewhat limited)&nbsp;steering. The way the cart is constructed is very clever and aesthetically pleasing and it uses a lot of interesting parts. This&nbsp;makes the kart&nbsp;an excellent addition to any Technic collection.</p>

<p>The B-model is what you would expect: less interesting because it has less functions&nbsp;and not nearly as pretty as the kart. The way it simulates a valve in the engine&nbsp;is funny, though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is an excellent&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/133573-c-model-42048-formula-1/"">C-model of a Formula 1 car</a>&nbsp;out there that is&nbsp;way better in my opinion because it keeps the same functions as the kart and looks much better than the B-model Lego designed.</p>
