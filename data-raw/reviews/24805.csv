<p>Without having had any interest in this set prior to that day, I saw it in the supermarket&nbsp;with a 50% discount and instantly decided to buy it alongside some other everyday items.</p>

<p>When opening the box, I was pleasantly surprised to find instruction books for both A and B model printed.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Construction</h2>

<p>I&nbsp;thoroughly enjoyed the building experience. In my opinion, this set offers an enjoyable building experience -- of course without the complexity of some larger Technic models, but still you will get&nbsp;a substantial build which does not&nbsp;need you to first of all clear away everything from your household&#39;s largest table to have just about enough space to open all bags of pieces.</p>

<p>There are no extraordinary building technics. However, the loader offers a compact, effective and elegant design.</p>

<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Functions</h2>

<p>Once finished, it offers some functions which work smoothly but not all of them are pleasing.</p>

<p><strong>Steering</strong><br />
Steering works good and smooth, however, the steering wheel is wobbly since the axle which holds it is fixed only marginally.</p>

<p><strong>Open/close grabber</strong><br />
The&nbsp;opening and closing mechanism of the grabber&nbsp;works perfectly using a gear behind the driver&#39;s cabin.</p>

<p><strong>Raise/lower grabber</strong><br />
Contrary to the open/close function, I am not pleased with the function to raise and lower the grabber. There is only an axle just behind the arm which needs to be pushed back and forth in order to raise and lower it. Compared to the very elegant opening/closing mechanism, this is&nbsp;lackluster.</p>

<p>Before my dark ages, some 15 years ago, I owned practically&nbsp;only Technic sets, and as a&nbsp;kid&nbsp;loved these sets for their functionality. Having some cranks at the side of the model to operate cranes, outriggers etc. was the most important aspect of these sets. It was interesting to remotely operate the functions instead of manually lifting the arm etc. (like it would be done with a City set).<br />
This is why, in my opinion, this mine loader somewhat leaves the impression as if the designer ran out of time and used the <em>first</em> instead of the <em>best</em> solution. I would have preferred a similar mechanism for lifting as was used for opening/closing the grabber.&nbsp;Though, this is may be only my AFOL perspective. Might be that from a kid&#39;s perspective, it is preferable to have a simple and fast mechanism to lift the grabber instead of the need to operate it from a gear behind.</p>

<p>However, using some additional&nbsp;pieces solely from&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42054-1/CLAAS-XERION-5000-TRAC-VC"">42054</a>&nbsp;CLAAS XERION 5000 TRAC VC, I made some modifications in order to have an additional gear next to the one that controls the grabber opening/closing function, which raises/lowers it using a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4612100/linear-aktuator-7-9-m"">linear actuator</a>. Placing a second gear to operate the function was somehow obvious, because in the set, as LEGO designed it, right next to the gear to open/close the grabber, there is some unused space where a second gear can be placed.</p>

<p>Since this modification requires&nbsp;an additional&nbsp;universal joint&nbsp;to pass through the articulated middle of the vehicle, it was more complicated than I originally thought. Nonetheless&nbsp;it is now possible to nicely operate both grabber functions from behind, using the&nbsp;two&nbsp;gears towards the back of the vehicle.</p>
