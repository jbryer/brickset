<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is uniform with other Dimensions sets. The cover art shows Gamer Kid enjoying a game of Defender ready to pop another quarter in the machine. &nbsp;The back art displays the 3 in 1 configurations of the Spyhunter car (1: Car, 2: Submarine, 3: Aircraft) and the Arcade Machine (1: Arcade Cabinet, 2: Flying shooter, 3: Pixel cannon)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A strong assortment of greens and blacks for the Arcade machine and whites and blacks for the vehicle. The most striking are the printed tiles done in the style of the Defender video game from the 80&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Gamer Kid should have a real name. &nbsp;His hair piece is pretty generic side part. Torso is unique with a black jacket and a green T-shirt with a yellow-green Invader in the center. He also has two accessories. 1: A single stud printed with a &#39;5&#39; to represent a game token. 2: A stud and single tube to represent a can of soda.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As with all Dimension sets, the instructions, beside the minifig,&nbsp;are displayed in the game.&nbsp;Both vehicle and device have a strong primary build and so-so alt modes. &nbsp;The Spyhunter car is a delight to build and fun to take off the toy tag and roll around on its own. The Arcade Cabinet is a very creative build for a arcade game in minifig scale. The alt modes are forgettable and I didn&#39;t make them more than once just to try them out.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Gameplay</h3>

<p>This is a Level Pack. You have a separate&nbsp;story mode to the game&#39;s main campaign. In a rundown part of town, Gamer Kid witnesses the old Retro Arcade explode with game sprites come to life. Only a skilled game can take on these vintage video games and tame the chaotic forces unleashed in the old arcade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this expansion, you as Gamer Kid must work your way through the arcade to get to the final level. Each room has plenty of in-game obstacles that can be overcome using Gamer Kid&#39;s abilities. &nbsp;Gamer has five related power-ups&nbsp;he can cycle through. (Laser Vision, Invisibility, Invincibility, Super Strength, Super Speed, &nbsp;</p>

<p>Each room is controlled by a game that you have to jack into using the arcade cabinet and must play to a certain level in order to unlock the final level. &nbsp;You play Spyhunter, Robotron, Joust, Super Sprint, Defender, Gauntlet and finally Rampage. &nbsp;All are emulations of original games. &nbsp;In addition, there is a hidden level that takes you into a level of Paperboy for several bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is replay value as you return to the Story Campaign to find Game Pads that unlock the 20+ games. The Midway Adventure world has more than a passing resemblance to Wreck-It-Ralph.</p>

<p>Since this review comes after all the Year 1&nbsp;sets have been released,&nbsp;I&#39;d recommend this to any who have just bought the Starter Pack. Gamer Kid&#39;s multiple powers can substitute for 2 or 3 Fun pack characters. &nbsp;Playing and mastering retro-80&#39;s games offer a challenge for those who have completed the main story. &nbsp;The Spyhunter car is fun on its own and Arcade Cabinet has a ridiculous amount of detail. It is a great value added to Lego Dimensions.&nbsp;</p>

Or Video Game companies, this Level Pack was the final release for LEGO Dimensions. By which I mean the last Level Pack made available in Series 1 not the overall LEGO Dimensions theme. This is a great looking set too for fans of Retro Video Games, especially as it includes a large number of Arcade games to play for high scores and a fun diversion when you&rsquo;re finished with the rest of the adventure in LEGO Dimensions.</span></span></span></span></p>

Kids who grew up in the 80s will be taken in by the artwork on this set and really enjoy all the nostalgic memories it drums up.</span></span></span></span></p>

All of the car builds that have and use four wheels are very well done, and this is meant to evoke the vehicle in a classic Arcade game based around James Bond. (Though not officially known by that IP.) It&rsquo;s a very impressive build and I can&rsquo;t get behind it enough.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Interdiver: Although resembling a submarine and with that name you&rsquo;d think it could, this model is actually a glorified motor boat, which is pretty impressive. In fact all three models built with this particular toy item are very impressively designed and have few if any visible studs.</span></span></span></span></p>

It is a little bit off from the parts use on the digital model unfortunately, but it does the best it can with what parts you are given and I think it&rsquo;s pretty solid.</span></span></span></span></p>

You can take multiples and put them all over LEGO City, so Bricklinking the parts is a must. The model looks very appropriate and the printed elements just add to the fun of it, building the arcade cabinet is just awesome all around.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a fun build and hides all of the printed elements behind it, which could be a bit of a disservice for all those elements.</span></span></span></span></p>

If that laser device was an old arcade machine built into a laser. It&rsquo;s actually a lot of fun to take the arcade machine and build this thing, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re playing the game for real while riding the machine.</span></span></span></span></p>

He&rsquo;s got a bunch of challenging puzzles to deal with involving attaching the Arcade Machine onto Arcade Stations and getting a certain number of points to achieve a medal in order to solve the puzzle and unlock that arcade cabinet in the adventure world. The level is fairly lengthy and the arcade games you have to play to pass some puzzles can cause some players to take longer to get through it.</span></span></span></span></p>

I haven&rsquo;t played any games of this sort for a considerably long time, but I managed to succeed despite my short comings and get through the level. It helps that most of the arcade titles are not as obscure or difficult as some of the other titles on offer in this pack.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;m a huge Gauntlet fan and their section is a great maze to travel through to get studs and access a few gold bricks.</span></span></span></span></p>

You get to experience so much, and a lot of the games can be quite amusing and fun to engage in. Defender, Rampage, Paperboy, Spy Hunter, Joust and Joust 2, as well as such interesting arcade titles as Toobin&rsquo; where you ride the rapids on an inflatable inner tube. This is a must own set, not only for the physical content, but the digital content which add literal hours of game play to LEGO Dimensions. I strongly recommend this set.</span></span></span></span></p>
