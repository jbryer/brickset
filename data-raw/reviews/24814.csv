<p>At Toys R Us, this is being sold for $5.99. I would say the rrp on brickset is more plausible and I applaud anyone that can find it for that price. At $3.99, I would highly recommend. At $5.99, I am more hesitant. A simple figure without any build or weapons shouldn&#39;t command that price. Minus shipping, the figure is cheaper on bricklink.</p>

<p>Although I will say my figure had eyes looking straight forward, unlike the other review that shows the eyes up to the left.</p>

<p>Get it if you are a completionist or a huge Star Wars fan, but otherwise it is a safe skip (unless at a reasonable price)</p>

How Good to See You Again.","<p><strong>Set #5002948 C-3PO: </strong>A free gift from LEGO here is The Force Awakens Threepio, and he is gorgeous. This minifigure looks highly impressive, it includes a very nice double-sided torso print with excellent detail work on Threepio&#39;s usual design. His arms include side printing, his legs have been printed on the front and with detail work on the sides and of course his head is the same as we&#39;ve seen before on Protocol Droids with great printing for the eyes.</p>

<p>Overall this is an awesome looking Threepio and is a must have for any Star Wars fan, he&#39;ll look great next to your other Force Awakens minifigures. If you missed out on getting this as a free gift from LEGO you&#39;ll need to hunt through the secondary market and hope you can find it for a decent price. Strongly Recommended.</p>

"vikings","2018-12-24T21:34:35.36Z","Great C-3PO","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bag just shows 3PO on it and comes with no instructions since it is just the figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Nothing special just the normal minifigure&nbsp;parts.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obviously you only get the Force Awakens C-3PO. I was really excited when I got him with his red arm. The detail on him is incredible. The sides of his arms and legs has all kinds of wires and joint markers. The opening on the front exposing all the different color wires. I love the head and how his eyes stand out from the rest of the gold color head of his unlike the old ones where there was no difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Not much else to say other than that they did a great job on the head of C-3PO.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is a great C-3PO.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was finally happy to see them add the red arm version of him. The way the eyes stand out from the rest of the head is really nice as well. Overall I&#39;ll give it a 5 star.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The bag has some nice printing, not your average set. I kept mine with some other polybags.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Torso, Legs, and Head, same as most.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;It is, of course, C-3PO, and he is as never before. The red arm is very nice, along with the side and front printing, both of which are exceptional.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Pretty much C-3P0.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I like this minifg.very much, I bought mine with the new Millennium Falcon, and they go extremely well displayed together.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Well worth the money if you get with another big set, and I think it is worth getting early because it will probably be rare, especially with the Force Awakens popularity.</p>

"haldir","2016-10-05T17:55:45.537Z","The Perfect Protocal","<h3>Packaging and Build</h3>

<p>This set does not have any instructions, as the build is only three pieces. The packaging looks nice with the stereotypical space background&nbsp;... though I don&#39;t recall the scene were C-3PO gets tossed into the endless void of space. Maybe I missed that part. It is nice that he is only four dollars, the price of a regular collectable minifigure. I think at one point he was even given away as a promotional. However, you will have to get him from Toys &#39;R&nbsp;Us; Amazon and E-bay have him listed as about ten&nbsp;dollars.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ui=2&amp;ik=e7487f0ff3&amp;view=att&amp;th=15795b367628fe28&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=safe&amp;zw"" style=""width: 320px; height: 240px;"" /></p>

<p>(Sorry this image is sideways, looks like the gravity stabilizers have reversed)</p>

<p>There are a whopping three parts in the whole model, so there is no need for instructions. At three parts and four dollars, this has to be about the worst price per piece ever, coming in&nbsp;at $1.33 per piece, but that is justifiable with the spectacular printing.</p>

<p>The Completed Model</p>

<p>Once you finally figure out that the torso goes on the legs and the head goes on the torso, you have a completed C-3PO. He looks really great, with pretty much standard front printing on the legs and torso, but it is very improved compared to the original C-3PO&nbsp;minifigure. You might see a glimpse of the real treat in this set ... the&nbsp;side printing.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ui=2&amp;ik=e7487f0ff3&amp;view=att&amp;th=15795b367628fe28&amp;attid=0.3&amp;disp=safe&amp;zw"" style=""width: 70px; height: 100px;"" /></p>

<p>Here it is, the arm printing that makes this figure the best protocol&nbsp;droid made by Lego yet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/?ui=2&amp;ik=e7487f0ff3&amp;view=att&amp;th=15795b367628fe28&amp;attid=0.5&amp;disp=safe&amp;zw"" style=""width: 320px; height: 240px;"" /></p>

<p>Because the printing is black, its a bit hard to see on the dark red arm, but it is a mirror of the other side. The printing on the legs really makes this&nbsp;guy&nbsp;look mechanical. I think the red arm looks nice for the overall appearance of the droid and its accurate to the movie. It gives the character a little more ... character? However, the red arm does limit his uses to Force Awakens uses, unless you replaced the red arm with a plain gold arm. By the way, here is the back:</p>

<p>Its nothing new, but I again really like the wire detailing. It would have been amazing if they printed the back of the legs, but I guess that is a bit too difficult.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I love this minifigure, and I definitely recommend getting it, especially if you collect Star Wars minifigures or you plan on getting the Resistance Troop Transporter. If you are&nbsp;getting that, this figure is more of a requirement than a recommendation. Thank you so much for reading this review. It&#39;s my first review, so if you enjoyed it or found it informative, please mark it as helpful. Sorry again for the sideways pictures, I&#39;ll try and figure that out.</p>

<p>C3-PO is a great figure of a beloved character that any Lego fan can appreciate the detail .</p>

<p>Minifigures -</p>

<p>His head is the standard moulded protocol droid head with printed photoreceptors , his torso is printed on both sides , his legs also have front printing and side printing along with his red and gold arms .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is an incredible figure that any star wars fan would want and appreciate .</p>

"TowSiff","2020-12-27T20:51:23.62Z","Brilliantly Designed Version of C-3PO!","<p><strong>Packaging/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>A simple polybag without an instruction booklet. Nothing special to mention here.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a basic minifigure without any accessories, hence the 1/5 rating.</p>

<p><strong>Minigure Itself</strong></p>

<p>Because of the updated, very detailed, design and the exclusiveness of it only being available in this set, its usefulness increases greatly. It might as well be of interest to use in relevant MOCs due to its awesome printing and overall design.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>Due to its low retail price it is of course worth the money. I myself bought two&nbsp;on the after-market for a reasonable amount, where the worthiness still holds if you appreciate these smaller, exclusive sets.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Brilliant polybag set with a useful minifigure! Would recommend if you are even somewhat interested in the Lego Star Wars franchise.</p>
