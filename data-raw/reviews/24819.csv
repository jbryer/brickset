Unlike the previous releases, this set features exterior activities, however the spirit of the thing is still very much in line with the prior sets. I was excited to pick up this release, but did that excitement last?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box for this set is similar to all of the other seasonal releases. It is not too large, and certainly not too small. The design is bright and clear, featuring images of all of the &quot;features&quot; of the set, adding some Halloween spookiness as necessary. The instruction booklet is small and easy to follow. There are no challenges in this set, and no surprises either. What you see on the box is what you get.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I do believe there are some parts that aren&#39;t widely available. Always nice to have the orange minifigure heads that stand in as pumpkins in this set. Though a pumpkin was released for a Scooby Doo set this year, I understand not including it here as a jack-o-lantern on the porch. There is so much going on in this vignette, visually, that the plain heads as pumpkins are nice. The plant parts in the olive green are also not in many sets and are nice to have. I personally love the olive green coloring for foliage, especially autumnal foliage, it rings more true than the bright green.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I enjoy the transparent bricks on the sides of the door, though they seem slightly out of place, they add a little festive feel to the entrance.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One of the minifigures is a skeleton. The other is a young witch. The witch&#39;s body is a little bizarre, at least the top half, the bodice seems to imply peasant or princess more than witch. The legs are dark blue and look like... denim? Over all, the kind of Trick Or Treat-er I&#39;d probably second-guess if they showed up at my door if it weren&#39;t for the hat.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly easy. I found myself frustrated with the tree. For some reason it didn&#39;t want to come together nicely or stay together, and pieces went everywhere as I tried to secure the foliage. I don&#39;t have large hands and I&#39;m not overly forceful, so this was surprising. Otherwise, the instructions were clear and the model was quite speedily completed.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is nice enough. While building it, I found myself wishing there were aspects about it that were different. I wanted a nicer interior wall. I would&#39;ve preferred that the model was an inside-out view, and that there was someone in costume answering the door instead of a skeleton. If I can see through you, you&#39;re not a real mini-person, skeleton. The completed model felt very busy and cluttered. I do understand that MANY porches and doorsteps take on that busy and cluttered look with Halloween decorations, but the gravestone and the pumpkins and the grass and the stairs, all fine alone, but in conjunction, a little much. There&#39;s really nowhere for the witch-girl to stand and beg for candy. (And when she&#39;s on the steps, her bucket is too big.)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is satisfactory. The house exterior certainly does look spooky with its black and purple detailing. The creepy decor is there, with the spider and the bat lurking around the build.&nbsp;And it does look autumnal with its decorative gourds and spooky tree.&nbsp;It&#39;s not amazing or excellent, but it&#39;s not awful. It&#39;s just pretty fairly good. It does manage to express the idea of Halloween, but I do believe there could have been slightly different execution that would have enhanced the look and feel of the model. With the obvious care and attention that had been placed on the previous models (and the Thanksgiving one), this vignette feels like it was rushed and is slightly out of place. For fans of the holiday, this is spot on. For others, it may be a miss.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-01T23:24:01.2Z","Holiday Vignette Impresses.","<p><strong>Set #40122 Trick or Treat Halloween Set: </strong>2015 gave us a series of impressive little vignets as LEGO Holiday based exclusives offered through LEGO stores and LEGO Shop &amp; Home. Each set was made with a specific holiday in mind, and each set is definitely a bit different though no less interesting in how they were executed. Having missed the earlier sets I have only the four end of year sets to discuss. So we shall start with Halloween and move on from there.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: The box design, as will be mentioned in other reviews of these sets definitely stands out. It does a brilliant job of catching your eye with its LEGO brick design and the images showcase the features of the set very nicely. The artwork used, what little there is, also showcases each Holiday that the set is based on, with some nice jack-o-lanterns and spider web patterns in other sets.</p>

<p>About the only problem I have with the design is that you have to punch out the back of the box in order to access the set. I can understand where boxes of this size tend to do that for cost saving measures no doubt, however I would prefer these holiday exclusives to be in taped boxes that can cut open and re-seal without damaging the look of the box.</p>

<p>Instructions: These are very nicely designed, they include the LEGO Exclusive brand design of the yellow box with studs of various colours on the front and they show the step-by-step build clearly and concisely. On the back cover is a shot of the next set in the release list, the Thanksgiving based set.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>There are a lot of nice pieces here, you&rsquo;ve got your basic black, including a black door, some purple, and a pair of nice mason bricks in tan.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Trick or Treater: As far as short legged Minifigures go this one isn&rsquo;t too bad, unfortunately it is a bit weaker as a Trick or Treater, her torso is a double-sided adult female print meant to be a dress for the witch. She includes a red pail with handle and witches broom for accessories and she&rsquo;s wearing a big black hat. She&rsquo;s not terrible, however she should have had a bit more care put into her choice of parts. Children this young should not have hourglass figures.</p>

<p>Skeleton: There is very little to say concerning this Minifigure, including it is meant to evoke the creepy atmosphere of Halloween, unfortunately compared to the other sets from this particular line I have to admit this is the weakest inclusion. An adult in costume handing out the candy would have been much better as a choice for such a set than this Skeleton which everybody at this point probably owns more than they really care for. Not exciting at all.</p>

<p>I do note however that this skeleton is not the flimsy arm version, instead it is the clip on version for the arms, which is mostly found in Ninjago sets, and few other sets I believe.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This set features mostly a little scene that you build up, the build is interesting. You basically get to build the front section of a house, with a spooky tree as a secondary model build. I felt there was some definite strengths of this build, and yet a few weaknesses as well. The inclusion of orange Minifigure heads for pumpkins is very well executed, the front door and the steps leading up to them look suitably horrifying.</p>

<p>There is no interior for the entrance, just a little bit of side walls and where the candy is meant to be kept. This is a weaker element and a tad unfortunate, though the level of detail in building the front of the house, including the small gravestone decoration is extremely well detailed and looks quite nice. This build relies heavily on SNOT techniques.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen other reviews that criticise this model because it&rsquo;s basically just a front stoop and entrance to a house with nothing really making the set stand out. I believe this is wrong, compared to the Winter Fun set which was released during winter was a much weaker build in my opinion.</p>

<p>This model is very gothic and the inspiration is obvious. It looks like a great little front entrance, it has loads of finer details for the outside with the grave and the pumpkins included. What I find a bit disappointing in this set is the lack of a decent sized front yard, everything is far too compacted in. The problem is sticking to the same square size for each Vignette, every set must conform to these dimensions. In my opinion the loose tree would look better off to one side of the door with the extra half-plate attached to the side of the front garden.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I really think this is a pretty decent set; it fits in quite nicely with the other Vignettes and makes a very good model. What it lacks however is some good selection in Minifigures and a bit more interior detail for the front entrance, something that could have been improved had the set not had to conform to the same dimensions of the other Vignettes. A wider plate, everything attached in front and a slightly longer foyer with greater details would really make it shine.</p>

<p>Still I do recommend tracking this set down, it&rsquo;s got a lot of nice parts including the three orange Minifigure heads for pumpkins, the red spider and the two olive green plant pieces similar to what is found in some of the Star Wars Kashyyyk sets. Being a limited run set it will be a bit more expensive the longer you wait I&rsquo;d wager, so try not to wait too long.</p>
