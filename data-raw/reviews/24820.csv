<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box like the others in the series has the comic on the back. Instructions show on the back the upcoming Christmas sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Parts on this were interesting. The turkey was split between two bags. 158 pieces to build it so at the price I got it..it was worth it. I like the gold shutters ALOT in this set. The colors go great.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigs are an older man and woman. The woman has a bun and her shirt has some gold on it which really brought out the holiday feel of the set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Build was fun as I enjoy sorting all the different pieces. The nstructions were easy to follow though I am sure for the younger crowd lining up the &quot;vines&quot; or making sure the pie is on the cart snugly might be difficult.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set does look cute once done. I like that there is a back side design to it, though I am sure displaying it will come into an issue. (Maybe a mirror to be able to see the back of it.) The colors go wonderfully together and I enjoy the way the table is done. The ability to put the food on the table vs the cart is great. Only downside is the apple in the bowl. Its a bit odd and almost out of place. I wish it would have been another pie or something.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really do like these small sets. They are great for displaying at work as well as home. My only other issue with the set (other than the random apple) is there is no plates! I would have rathered two plates be included VS the apple and bowl. I probably will take a plate or two from my extras and use it on here. It just feels like it would be needed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will say get this set for displaying. Playing..might get a few hours of fun...maybe out of it but this really seems more of a display item. It&#39;s def worth the price.</p>

"mr_piggle","2015-10-28T01:09:28.077Z","A feast for the eyes?!","<p>Bringing the 2015 seasonal vignettes back to their heart, the Thanksgiving Feast is once again a charming slice of life made from brick.&nbsp;It&#39;s almost&nbsp;as if someone took a Polaroid of Nana and Pop-pop having wine and pie after a successful meal while the relatives snooze and watch football.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Once again, there is nothing outlandish or unexpected about either the box or the instructions. The box is regularly sized for a small set and is covered in images that depict the various aspects of the Thanksgiving celebration. The instruction booklet is easy to follow AND offers a preview of the next two sets in the seasonal line, which is lovely if you&#39;re into sneak peeks. There is everything you would expect from the box and instructions and nothing you wouldn&#39;t expect, which is to say that everything is just as it should be -- comprehensive and easy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>At 158 parts, the set has a decent price/piece ratio. The orange pumpkin head or (or head pumpkin) returns in this set decorating the table. Autumn is not only the time for Thanksgiving Feasts, but is also decorative gourd season, don&#39;t you know! As this piece is only available in 5 sets in this color, it may be an enticing piece. There&#39;s a lime green inverted dome that&#39;s only in one other set, some good hair, and that cooked&nbsp;turkey&nbsp;that I really love. (The legs snap on! It&#39;s so great!) I feel like there are a lot of quality parts in this set, and that people would definitely grab duplicates for parts to flesh out interiors and the like.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are charming. They remind me of my parents, which is probably a good thing on a good day. I enjoy their parental feel, I think the use of older minifigures is really nice on the Thanksgiving set as is really reflects the spirit and tone of the holiday. This&nbsp;contrasts nicely against&nbsp;the younger couple in the Valentine&#39;s Day set, which feels more like a younger crowd&#39;s holiday. Again, the grey bun hair piece is pretty neat, and hasn&#39;t been seen much.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is uncomplicated and actually a bit joyful. It was refreshing after the prior seasonal set. It&#39;s lovely how both the inside and outside of the vignette shape up, and the exterior detailing is quite lovely and autumnal. There is not a lot to say about the build because nothing stood out as being terrible or overwhelming. There are quite a few clever details, like the table runner.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>There are two things that I found frustrating with the completed model. The first was the blasted giant apple on the food cart. I hate the apple, I hate that it doesn&#39;t attach to anything, I hate that it&#39;s huge compared to the pie and the pumpkin on the table. I wish there had been some other food option, as the apple really doesn&#39;t seem to go. I would be satisfied without that apple. The second thing that I found frustrating was what I had assumed was a window, but eventually came to realize was more likely a china cabinet. With the golden shutters (which are just lovely) one expects there to be a window near the table, but since there is nothing but white wall behind those shutters, it quickly becomes apparent that the intention was not, in fact, a window. It might have been nice to build in a shelf or two and place some bottles or cups on the shelf, just to really solidify the &quot;totally not a window&quot; idea.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, there are many charming and clever details, such as the pointed edges of the table runner and the potted plant. The autumnally colored ivy climbing the exterior wall is a very nice touch.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, this set is lovely and worth the purchase. The seasonal sets that have been available for 2015 have been very engaging and worthy of inclusion in larger builds or in play. Is there a lot of playability? Probably not. There are no flick-fire missiles or catapults, after all. However, there are figures and there&#39;s a turkey with detachable legs, and there&#39;s a great food cart... so there is SOME play value in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I find these seasonal vignettes&nbsp;much more fulfilling and desirable than previous years sets, and wish the trend of the 8x8 vignette would continue. The Thanksgiving Feast may have been my favorite seasonal release of this year yet!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-08-01T23:25:30.51Z","Great Looking Vignette Set.","<p><strong>Set #40123 Thanksgiving Feast:</strong> The next Vignette style build, this model is a vast improvement compared to the Halloween set in design, execution and included Minifigures. Let&rsquo;s discuss all of the elements involved and then let you know if this is a set worth tracking down on the secondary market.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: This is a LEGO Exclusive and it shows, from the simple yellow LEGO brick styling of the box design, to the Seasonal Themed art design on the front and back of the box everything looks great. It is a design that LEGO keeps strictly for in-house sets, which makes it quite easy to find while in any LEGO Store in the world. The front and back also do wonderful jobs showcasing the set and all of the well-executed features found within.</p>

<p>Instructions: Great looking instructions with all the steps laid out in order and nothing too tricky or frustrating for any age of builders. On the back cover are the two final sets revealed where we see an interior and exterior Winter/Christmas based set, one for Christmas the other more for a Winter kind of scene.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set has loads of bricks, you&rsquo;ve got some tan mason bricks, dark red 1x2 regular bricks and some matching plates to go with them. Also this is the first set I&rsquo;ve encountered which includes the large Turkey piece, and in such a small set as well, a very nice inclusion for this set.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Old Woman: Dressed all in red with a plain pair of red legs and a double-sided torso with a great printed dress, this female Minifigure stands out as one of the better offerings from LEGO City or Seasonal sets. The only issues I can see with her is the fact that her facial print doesn&rsquo;t match the colour of her hairpiece, at least when it comes to the eyebrows, which is most unfortunate. Her hairpiece in this colour is quite unique and very well done, she looks the part of an elderly woman.</p>

<p>Old Man: Compared to his wife, this elder is a bit less detailed. With plain grey legs, a green torso with a sweater print on both front and back, minimal printed detailing I should say, and a single sided face with a smirking expression and a hairpiece that is fairly standard. Except of course it&rsquo;s new in this colour if I&rsquo;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>Overall a decent pair of Minifigures with some terrific use of parts.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Comparing this to the Halloween set I find this build much more satisfying, while the level of detail in the previous set was very impressive and worked well for the exterior of the front entrance of the house that was being visited, the interior kitchen scene we have here is just breathtaking. With excellent techniques used to build the kitchen drawers under the window and the table and chairs are nicely made for such a small scene.</p>

<p>The exterior detailing of this build is also quite nicely done, you&rsquo;ve got some great use of white bricks with a few mason bricks thrown in for the outside wall of the houses&rsquo; kitchen. Then you get to build a small trolley with space for the turkey, a bowl of fruit and underneath a pie for dessert. This little mini-model looks great and works much better as an add on model compared to the tree from the Halloween set.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This little Vignette model is a very impressive looking one, I enjoy the techniques used in building up the small fa&ccedil;ade of a wall and the interior furniture used here for an intimate feast between a lovely old married couple.</p>

<p>Everything just looks brilliant, it includes some very impressive detail work, the tablecloth uses the Mixel teeth piece to make the hanging edge of the tablecloth, and jumper tiles are used in conjunction with smooth tiles for a SNOT tabletop that can hold the food and wine glasses used for the meal.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a nice use of a window on one side of the wall for a Wine Cabinet, the small planter looks great, the small trolley is a very nice model, it works great as an add-on to this set.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I love the charm and design of this set, it&rsquo;s very impressive for such a small little set that is designed to celebrate a particular holiday. The numerous accessories and the enjoyable build techniques make this one of the better offerings from this Seasonal batch released in 2015. I recommend this set whole heartedly, it is one definitely worth tracking down if you missed it the first time out.</p>
