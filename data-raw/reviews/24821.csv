Unfortunately many have pointed out that it is rather weak of the vignette style sets, does this mean it&rsquo;s bad? I would think far from it, however it is up to one&rsquo;s tastes if you enjoy it or not.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: As noted before these boxes are very well designed, I enjoy them quite nicely and their thematic choices are very well executed. They are easy to find when searching in the LEGO Store and they stand out above any other design from other Themes.</p>

<p>Instructions: Again they are great, they show the build steps quite nicely and include the other Christmas set on the back of the book as a cross-promotional set image. Nothing too difficult to follow while building the model.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Aside from the six grey mason bricks there really isn&rsquo;t much in the way of parts in this set. Although the Husky is a good piece for fans of LEGO animals.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Boy: A very nice looking Minifigure wearing a single-sided racing jacket found on most LEGO Racers in LEGO city, he has a double-sided head which is a bit unfortunate, the happy and sad expressions look fine, but the use of the sport helmet instead of a tuque or larger head piece means that you can see his mouth from the back easily which just looks terrible.</p>

<p>Girl: Again we have a little child represented with an hourglass figure double-sided print, the winter sweater with purple scarf print is found on many older women in LEGO City winter themed sets. Giving it to a child is a bit of a questionable design choice, and really should have been better thought out. I suppose it was done because both children are wearing hats for head gear, meaning they couldn&rsquo;t give her a ponytail hair piece or similar female based one to indicate she is a girl.</p>

<p>She&rsquo;s wearing a dark blue tuque/beanie, which is a nice head piece, however giving her hair might have been better.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This is, unfortunately, one of the weakest builds from the Vignette style sets of last year. The exterior fa&ccedil;ade of the building has some detailing thanks to the mason bricks and the small 1x2 maroon bricks with the groove in the centre. However the front entrance is lacking in crucial details, where the Halloween based set had a decent build for the front stairs, this house has more empty space, the stairs leading to the door are shorter and less detailed and the inclusion of a tree in front of the house takes up too much space for such a small set.</p>

<p>The snowman and sled mini-models included for other details offer some much needed detail elements, however it might have been nicer to have the snowman in front of the house attached to the baseplate instead.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This set has the least amount of pieces of the four I managed to get and it is fairly obvious from the model. There isn&rsquo;t much for the front fa&ccedil;ade of the entrance to the house, not as many details as the Halloween set and even less on the inside of the front door than that set, there isn&rsquo;t even any studs to attach the minifigs to.</p>

<p>You will have a very well built snowman, a great little sled and a Husky dog animal piece in this set. Honestly I am not as thrilled with this model as the others, there are still some obvious Christmas ideas here, a small tree is outside the front steps and hanging on the door is a wreath.</p>

<p>The model makes up for some of its shortcomings with the front wall design, the use of the mason bricks and some nice 1x2 short bricks with the grooves in them that are in a nice dark brown. If not for these this set would suffer a much lower score because it lacks enough features compared to the others.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>My thoughts on this set is it could stand to use a bit longer in the designing phase to cement a very great model. This Vignette is definitely trying to emulate Winter Fun for children, however it lacks in some crucial details that would work much better. For one thing it might have been nice to see lights hanging down from the roof, and the inside of the door could use a bit more detail there. I&rsquo;d recommend this mostly for the parts, for MOC fans, the mason bricks and the other bricks are very useful for building up your own models.</p>
