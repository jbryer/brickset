Most of the other sets have included two Minifigures unfortunately this one only includes one, which is slightly a shame, however it is what it is. Let&rsquo;s go over everything and then discuss if it&rsquo;s worth tracking down or not.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Box: This box is just like the other three I&rsquo;ve picked up. Very well designed and a great eye catcher for this limited set. It shows off the scene from the set brilliantly and with a cute little kitty on the front of the box it really makes you want to smile.</p>

<p>Instructions: The manual is in keeping with the other sets from this series, it&rsquo;s straight forward build instructions with a picture of Winter Fun on the back, There are no big tricky parts or anything in this set, so everyone can enjoy building it as part of a fun Holiday activity.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Lots of Mason bricks here, all in grey, there&rsquo;s also a nice 4x8 tan plate, not exactly sure if that&rsquo;s rare, but it looks like a highly useful piece for MOC fans.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Santa: There isn&rsquo;t really much to say here, Santa is the same we&rsquo;ve seen in Christmas and Holiday Themed sets since the introduction of this build in the CMF line, in fact this little Santa is the exact same figure. The only CMF to be offered in the exact same look and colours in Sets and as a single packed CMF. He includes his beard, bag and Santa hat, if you&rsquo;ve seen one you&rsquo;ve seen them all pretty much. Which is why I&rsquo;m a bit upset that they didn&rsquo;t include some other Minifigure.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This is a great SNOT Technique build with a very well thought out use of tiles for the floor, the chimney build is also quite impressive relying on the mason bricks to great effect. The small Christmas Tree which is also built in this set really does a great job of looking like a tree, a bit small perhaps compared to the Minifigure, I mean they&rsquo;re pretty much equal in height give or take half an inch, so the build is smaller than what you&rsquo;d expect, however the tree model is nice and creative.</p>

<p>Rounding off the build is a nice looking large sofa chair and a small table. Everything you build is fun and quick, with nothing stopping you along the way.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This is the better winter/Christmas based set of the series. It stands out really well, with some excellent SNOT techniques used for the interior room in front of the fireplace, and the large selection of mason bricks to make the chimney and the mantle look very convincing, this model just cries out as perfectly designed for a Vignette.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got a great chair for Santa to sit in, a fun little table in front of the fireplace loaded down with treats for St. Nick to enjoy before getting back to delivering presents. The included tree model might be a bit short for a Christmas tree, it still has a great build to it and looks perfect. Except for the star at the top, I really wish LEGO could perfect a good way of putting a star topper on. This uses the LEGO Friends star shaped cookie, not the best choice, but better than sticking a starfish or a magic wand on top.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Get this set, the use of parts, the design of the build, everything is just brilliantly executed. The only problems I see with it is the lack of a second Minifigure, the cat piece is the same one from Mrs. Scratchen-Post, so it isn&rsquo;t new as far as prints go, but it does add a bit more to the value since you don&rsquo;t get any elves or anything for a second Minifigure. Since all of the other sets included two Minifigures the absence of another one is a bit glaring here. Still highly recommended.</p>

"omnius","2019-12-20T21:05:51.443Z","A fun little Christmas scene","<p>Released as part of a series of seasonal vignettes, this detailed scene depicts Santa going about his rounds, only to be distracted by biscuits and a drink! Covering an 8x9 area (excluding the tree), it fits a lot of detail into a small space, including a festively-decorated fireplace, armchair and table. Santa fits comfortably into the chair, and there&#39;s even a 2x2 jumper plate where Santa&#39;s sack can be secured in place. The scene is rounded out by a small Christmas tree, and a family cat investigating the night-time visitor.</p>

<p>Play value is limited, as it&#39;s a small scene intended for display more than anything else, but weighing in at 167 parts it still makes for an intricate build that&#39;s pleasing to the eye. If you&#39;re looking for a Christmas scene to go on your desk, shelf or mantlepiece, then look no further!</p>

<p>Building experience and price make this absolutely worth it. Playability is meh, but parts are good.</p>
