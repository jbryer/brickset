Unfortunately the only way was either to splash out&nbsp;a lot of money on E-bay or&nbsp;become a Lego&nbsp;shop customer. Which I did, so strong was my desire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was my first free promo set and I have to say it&#39;s still my number one. The fountain set&nbsp;is right behind it, but this&nbsp;freebie has everything many regular sets lack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all it&#39;s a full structure. Many Lego sets are only &#39;lookers&#39; from one angle. Not this one. All angles are pleasant and the proportions are in harmony. It&#39;s not minifig scale but when you pose a figure next to it, it&#39;s perfectly fine, like a small winter cottage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even though the set is colourful, it&#39;s never garish. The attention to detail is astonishing on such a small scale and you can shuffle the tiny decorations to make it look slightly different every year. (I have to remind myself the licorice allsorts is not for eating :-)</p>

<p>The set has very limited playability but I don&#39;t see it as a problem. You can use it as a nice storage space for you mini brick-built&nbsp;Christmas presents, a weekend house for you Lego Santa&nbsp;or&nbsp;even use it as a money bank for children. It will also&nbsp;be a nice addition to your&nbsp;Christmas village.</p>

<p>The set came with an extraordinary number of spare parts, sure only 1x1 but still a nice unexpected bonus.</p>

<p>Although with a minifig the set would have been heavenly, it&#39;s still perfect and such joy to look at, especially during Christmas time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"pinz","2018-03-02T00:06:13.92Z","nice extra at the Christmas shopping","<p>This set was an gift in the Legostore, if you had a total amount above some limit. With 2 kids, easy :-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set itself is nice and very colourful. The build was easy enough, so that even the 4 year old kid could join. The instructions are easy and the parts are nice. I like this modified bricks, that look like a brick wall (well it is a brick&nbsp;wall&nbsp;after all).</p>

<p>Every year now we put out on display during the seasondays.</p>

<p>If you get hold of one these sets, catch it or if not look the parts up at bricklink, they are not so special, just colorful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I personally liked this Christmas gift from Lego.</p>
