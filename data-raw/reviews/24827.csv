<p>The Lego star wars magazine mini jango fetts slave 1 is a very good build such gains high marks in the swooshability factor .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build uses two 1&times;1 trans cheese sloped for the round windshield and two modified 2&times;2 blue plates for the base of the ship the main nose is tiled of nicely and has a great technique to make it sturdy the main issue is one that is easily involving the two 1&times;2 white grill tiles they just make the wings too wide but it can easily be modified .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a set I would recommend to star wars fans and microscale build fans .</p>
