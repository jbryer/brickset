It&rsquo;d be nice to see one of these a year for the next few years, however I have to wonder about the continuity of this series, it&rsquo;d be nice to see an updated guide to the LEGO DC Universe with a hint of the timeline of events for these specials.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>As far as presentation goes the case for this film is pretty impressive. It shows off some decent looking shots of the characters and it looks very DC Comics fun. The overall look of everything stands out on the shelf so you won&rsquo;t miss it. The box can be damaged easily at the corners when crammed on the shelves at Wal-Mart, this is something to be wary of when purchasing at the store. The Minifigure is quite prominent on the front, returning the small case to the box itself can be tricky if you prefer keeping everything pristine from the packaging.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Trickster: One of The Flash&rsquo;s rogues is given to us as a Minifigure with this film and it&rsquo;s a great looking figure. With a double-sided torso print and some nice two-toned arms giving him a short sleeved look. He also has some great leg printing which is on the front and the side of the legs. His facial print is single-sided and he has the sleepyhead hair piece in a nice orange colouring. Overall this is a great looking Minifigure and a nice addition to the DC Super Heroes villains collection.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>Compared to the original LEGO DC Batman special this one doesn&rsquo;t offer much, the special Attack of the Legion of Doom is very well done, the animation and style is what we&rsquo;ve come to expect from these specials and I enjoyed what I saw. It is a bit unfortunate that the voice cast for some of the characters do not carry over from LEGO Batman 2, Lex Luthor for example has a new voice.</p>

<p>What is unfortunate is that there is only one bonus thing to watch, a special featurette that details how the sound effects crew make the unique sounds of the LEGO DC Universe in these animated shorts. Considering the price it is unfortunate that there isn&rsquo;t as much to do or see for the target audience, it might have been nice to see either another short like the Bat-Mite one, or some fan made shorts using the sets from this particular cast and crew of the DC LEGO Universe.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I can honestly say that while I do find the contents a bit short and lacking compared to past LEGO Specials, the fact that it includes a unique villain for The Flash and continues the tradition of animated LEGO DC specials I&rsquo;m glad to see it and can wholeheartedly recommend it. I&rsquo;m just disappointed that it did not include any other shorts to enjoy.</p>
