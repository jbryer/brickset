<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The box is the way in which&nbsp;we usually get,&nbsp;marked&nbsp;with a TrU exclusive logo on the top-right corner. However, I would have been happier if I could open it without breaking the box :&#39;(</p>

<p>It is&nbsp;filled&nbsp;quite nicely by&nbsp;bags and not much space is left inside.</p>

<p>This set includes various special parts, especially rare colored bricks such as 3 Sand green&nbsp;profile brick 1x2 single Gro(6075617), 12 Sand blue Brick 1X2 W. Groove(4620991) and a few food related pieces, notably the croissant and the cupcake.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None!(The clone lieutenant not included)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was quite enjoyable for a 200-300 pieces set pure Lego System set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cars were fairly simple&nbsp;but easily gets the job&nbsp;done.</p>

<p>We start by making a foundation, while quite straight forward, it has implemented a bit of offsetting with some jumper pieces so that&nbsp;a section of the building &quot; pops out&quot;, making up&nbsp;the dullness of the 2nd and 3rd floor by their similarities.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a set at this scale,&nbsp;it is extremely&nbsp;detailed and the designer Melody Caddick sure put a lot of thoughts in this one.</p>

<p>The first floor&#39;s exterior(or ground floor)is well-decorated with several plants, the lamp post and what seems a table with a parasol.</p>

<p>It has a very detailed first floor(that even has a small glass window&nbsp;displaying the cakes), which in my opinion is the spotlight of the set.</p>

<p>The building itself is quite the same on the 2nd and the 3rd floor, but overall it creates a great dynamic effect together(of unity) and its&#39; dullness is neglect-able as we get there most of our&nbsp;interesting parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The playability is quite low as this more a display model(you can play with the 2 cars if you want to play very badly XD)</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a fantastic display&nbsp;set, get it while it is still possible (preferable with all 4 of the series)!</p>
