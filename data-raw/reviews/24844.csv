"Nouri","2015-12-30T21:48:49.427Z","Great Set on a Little Scale!","<p>As an avid polybag collector, I&#39;ve been collecting these wonderful mini-scale sets for years now and I can effectively say that this is one of the best Polybags I&#39;ve seen from the Star Wars line in a while.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As is the case with most polybags, this polybag comes in the standard polybag size as well as extra small instructions which are once again very typical of polybags. The polybag art is very nice and compliments the small fighter very well. The added explosions as well as the darkness of space nicely compliment both the gray and red elements on the set. The overall color scheme of the package, black and red, really add a sinister feel to the whole set which is very nice for what is supposed to be a sinister star fighter. Impressive!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The TIE comes with some very nice pieces in black that are very multipurpose. The cockpit piece is printed which is another useful piece that is welcomed by all Star Wars fans. Other than that not too much to say about the parts although overall you get a very nice selection of parts to work with.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A - No Minifigures included.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very simple with few complicated elements with the exception being the slight use of technic pins in the sides to keep the TIE Fighter&#39;s solar panels/wings attached.The build is definitely very fun to see come together and a slight variation of what is typical of polybag sets.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is what makes this set shine the most. Overall it&#39;s very impressive, even for its small size, and is what makes the set such a hit in the first place. When compared to its larger counterpart <em>Set 75101 First Order Special Forces TIE Fighter </em>(http://brickset.com/sets/75101-1/First-Order-Special-Forces-TIE-Fighter) it fares very nicely and looks almost like an exact replica of the set (albeit in smaller form)!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall this polybag has the makings of a great set and is one of the best polybags I&#39;ve seen in a long while. It&#39;s added detail with the printed cockpit and wings as well as its accuracy to the original model really puts it as the top of my list in regards to polybags. Along with that the set is also very sturdy and can easily be handled by a younger child who just wishes to fly it around as if they were controlling it in the movie. The polybag art is amazing and compliments the set very nicely and the build is simple enough that even the most intermediate of builders can build it and maybe even learn a thing or two!</p>

<p>You can&rsquo;t really say much about polybag packaging however this one does stand out. It seems the TIE Fighter is about to fly off the polybag leaving the &lsquo;LEGO Star Wars&rsquo; banner behind which could possibly make it stand out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The model clearly reflects every major design element of the TIE Fighter from Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) besides the absence of the black lines on the wings. They would have been extremely difficult to replicate using LEGO elements at this scale, however the black elements on wings do a good enough job to add some of that black detail and make the wings look a little interesting. One aspect of the wings, in the way which the model is built you can see several exposed holes from the &lsquo;4211449: Plate 2X8 W. Holes&rsquo; however those were crucial to the wing attachment, they could have possibly been covered up.</p>

<p>Moving towards the centre of the model you&rsquo;ll see a representation of the spherical cockpit shape replicated using several &lsquo;4032 - Plate 2X2 Round&rsquo; which have done the job to an extent. I&rsquo;m intrigued by use of the &lsquo;6093977: Double Conical Wheel Z20 1M&rsquo; as the ends of the cockpit which would go on to hold the pair of wings. The details such as the blaster on the top of the TIE Fighter really works well and additionally it can be rotated however there is some limitation in the movement. The single printed piece is a fine addition to adding some realism to the face of the cockpit which proves why this design has been carried out though other TIE mini models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Analysis / Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Despite the small issues that cannot be fixed at this scale I feel the designer has done a fantastic job of replicating the details of the source material. It contains several cool building techniques which makes it a far superior mini model than others and a great learning experience for new builders. Unlike the larger one this affordable so you could gather a ton and make your own battle scenes in miniature scale. Don&rsquo;t forget you can also swoosh this one too! It&rsquo;s one of the few polybags I&rsquo;ve kept to display; not one but three!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Design: 8/10 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Lack of some details due to scale;&nbsp;otherwise an excellent translation of the full scale model.</p>

<p><strong>Build: 8/10 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Interesting and educational build for younger builders.<br />
<br />
<strong>Playability: 8/10 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Swooshable!</p>

<p><strong>Parts: 8/10 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Much like most LEGO Star Wars sets it also contains a rather dull colour scheme as we&rsquo;ve all come to expect however this set breaks it up a little red and&nbsp;offers and interesting variation of different elements including&nbsp;the printed &lsquo;4657615 - Parabol Element &Oslash;16 &quot;Tie Nr.1.&quot;&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 8/10 &ndash;</strong>&nbsp;Small&nbsp;unavoidable&nbsp;detail issues; however a&nbsp;fantastic and swooshable mini model nevertheless!</p>

<p>The set comes in the normal polybag and the normal polybag sized instruction manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The only cool or unique piece is the printed dish that goes over the cockpit.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Nothing hard or difficult with it. Took me under 2 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Once I was finished with it I was really happy with it. The new design with it was really good. I also liked the printed dish for the cockpit. Also having a piece where it could dock to something else was a neat addition to the set as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is my favorite mini Tie Fighter I own yet (I own 3 different ones including this one). The new design is really good and the printed dish for the cockpit was a nice addition as well. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-04-21T08:43:42.097Z","A Re-coloured TIE Fighter for a New Trilogy","<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49775855023_790b194221_o.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; height: 214px;"" /></p>

<p>This is my second review with picture, so I decided that I should do a Star Wars set because Star Wars is by far my favourite LEGO theme. These TIE Fighters were used by the dreaded First Order, ruled by Kylo Ren and General Hux. If I&nbsp;remember correctly, I believe we only saw Special Forces TIEs, which have a glint of red here and there. This poly bag was available in the UK with a purchase of the Daily Mail newspaper in November 2015. In the US, it was available from Target the following month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note from me: I have taken all these pictures myself. This may be hard to read on a phone.</p>

<h3>Instructions/packaging:</h3>

<p>I opened this quite a long time ago, so I&nbsp;no longer have the poly bag in which it came in, but Brickset&#39;s main picture is of the poly bag. The instructions are packed into a small leaflet and have easy to follow steps. The only complaint I have is generalised to all LEGO sets; the &#39;2x&#39; sign is placed after the step is complete. If it was in advance, you could be getting all the pieces together.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49775854888_b1874421e2_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 132px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49776718062_7cec42fd55_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 133px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>The total amount of pieces is 41, not including the spare/extra pieces. The rarest part in the set is also the only printed piece in the set. The printed cockpit disc can only be found in a total of 5 sets and are all used to make different TIE Fighters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49776718472_938c60e86d_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 133px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no minifigures, so I shall skip that section.</p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>The build is possibly the most repetitive build in a poly bag because you are doing exactly the same on both sides. The first part is the main body and the second part is the 2 wings. My only difficulty is that all the&nbsp;red 2x2 circular plates (apart from 1)&nbsp;are&nbsp;use where they can&#39;t be seen on the finished model.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49775855143_a9a2b0f3d0_o.jpg"" style=""width: 100px; height: 83px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49775855173_93dd600d03_o.jpg"" style=""width: 95px; height: 83px;"" /></p>

<h3>The Completed Model:</h3>

<p>The wings are flanked by black gears, followed by a red (on the right) and black (on the left) 2x2 circular plates. They sit with the body on a black cross axle (8m). The back is adorned with a red grill and a black clip that attaches to a nozzle gun, which acts as an antenna. The translucent red stud behind the printed cockpit piece gives a nice shade to the cockpit. A minifigure is just taller than the halfway point on the wing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>The TIE&#39;s wings are really nicely decorated and the red gives the small ship the First Order touch. It is really accurate to&nbsp;the movies. The cockpit disc gives it a certain rarity and calls for people to buy multiples. I have 2 and I can&#39;t see any flaws other than the matter of the misuse of the red circular 2x2 discs. It is great for a fleet builder and I&nbsp;can see many people looking to buy a whole squadron, which would call for a micro-battle between a few resistance poly bags. I fully recommend this poly bag, with a full-star&nbsp;rating.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my review and I&nbsp;will be making more Star Wars picture reviews pretty soon, so look out for them!</p>

"CommisarRoberts","2020-03-28T11:29:01.24Z","A very good Polybag set","<p>This Polybag set is a miniature version of one of the First Orders TIE Fighters from the Star Wars Sequel trilogy.</p>

<p>The completed model is about the size of one of the micro fighter sets and looks very good when completed. The set only has 41 pieces but uses quite a diverse range of pieces to&nbsp; achieve the finished look of the TIE fighter.&nbsp;</p>
