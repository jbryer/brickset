<p>Inside the book are some facts about some of the characters, vehicles and weapons&nbsp;from Ninjago. It also includes&nbsp;some very fun pages featuring callbacks to different scenes throughout the show from seasons one to four! The minifigure included&nbsp;in&nbsp;this book is highly detailed and great for play or display!</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say it is a good price for a great book and minifigure and I recommend you to buy it!</p>
