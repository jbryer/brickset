<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Minifigure parts come in a nice looking foil polybag. No instructions are included since the build is really oblivious.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Ming:</strong>The minifigure included is Ming who is a ghost warrior. The good thing of getting this magazine is that Ming only comes in the city of Stix which is a expensive set. Ming has a translucent head,legs and back of his mask. Great printing like any Ninjago minifigure. Great mold for the ninja like mask which has a green bit at the back. He carry&#39;s this strange axe like weapon which is made out of a brown stick, an axe piece, a black lightsaber hilt and a dark&nbsp; grey dagger.</p>

<h3>The Magazine</h3>

<p>The magazine include is issue 6. It features great comic,nice facts about the tv show, win prices,people drawings and some nice poster. It has some nice art work as well. However I felt the magazine needed more activities and puzzle.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really like what you get here! The minifigure is great and the magazine is fun to read and comes at a great price at &pound;3.25 which I think is worth buying. For AFOL and collectors you might not be interested in the magazine but it&#39;s great for the Minifigure if you want to get it and if you have any children who are a fan of ninjago this might be a good gift to get for them.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Thanks for reading this review and I hope you have a great day!</strong></p>
