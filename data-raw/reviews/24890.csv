<p><strong>Awesomeness:</strong>&nbsp; This little bag comes with a little 4 wheeler build that Hulk can rip apart (like on the picture on the bag) because it is a Hydra 4 wheeler.&nbsp; It&#39;s cool that you can either use the vehicle while playing or just have him hold it for display.&nbsp; It is actually the same little vehicle that Kraven the Hunter has it the Bridge Battle set.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Even cooler is this bag comes with extra stickers for your other Hydra and Shield vehicles.&nbsp; I think it is such a good idea (even though a lot of people HATE stickers) and my son enjoyed customizing his vehicles.&nbsp; The Rocket Raccoon polybag also comes with extra stickers.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig:</strong>&nbsp; It is basically a small version of the newer bigfig of Hulk and he looks great.&nbsp; The other smaller hulk is the bright green one with wacky purple pants that looks like it might be the Lou Ferigno hulk.&nbsp; This hulk has the same hair that Tony Stark has.</p>

<p><strong>Well...</strong> Hulk has become one of the most popular superheroes recently so I was glad to get a different version for my collection.&nbsp; He looks great with all my other Avenger sets.&nbsp; I held onto my stickers for a rainy day but 5 year old had a blast putting all of his on his sets.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T16:07:46.483Z","The Hulk for Free, Good Deal","<p><strong>Set #5003084 The Hulk:</strong> A promotional polybag from 2015 this little set was a great giveaway set, prices on the secondary market might be a bit high after the fact, however it&rsquo;s a fun little set and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Includes a simple and fast to build little buggy model that can be torn in half to simulate the Hulk&rsquo;s rage as he fights enemies.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Hulk Minifigure is rare and hard to come by, equally greatly detailed as it features a double-sided torso print with defined muscles, leg printing that includes side printing for the traditional purple shorts, which is dual molded as well and a great expression filled double-sided torso print with rage and hulking rage expressions.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Also includes a sticker sheet to deck out anything you&rsquo;d care to with Avengers, SHEILD, Hydra or Stark Industries logos.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Sticker sheet included isn&rsquo;t for one specific item like the Rocket Racoon sticker sheet, which was for the Milano, which some might feel disappointing.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>No Minifigure accessories and very small piece count for what is included, for free that isn&rsquo;t much of a problem, paying for it after the fact might be a bit disappointing because of this.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This particular Polybag is a very fun little companion set to the Age of Ultron Sub-Theme. The Hulk Minifigure is now in screen accurate dark green colouring, unfortunately Bruce Banner still hasn&rsquo;t been made as a Minifigure. Either way I dig this item and I recommend it for fans of the MCU sets, the inclusion of numerous stickers can be good for MOC fans who don&rsquo;t mind using stickers to enhance their models, those who prefer printed details will find this rather useless.</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-09T01:35:44.217Z","Hulk Smash? Or Pull? ","<p>For review number 9, we have&nbsp;5003084-1: The Hulk. Is this minifig version of the Green Goliath as much fun? Yes and bonus stickers too!</p>

<p>Minifigure: Of course this is the focus of the set, and it&#39;s great. The color, the printed pants, and the faces are great. It has two angry faces, with reeeeeeally angry and one just really angry. The torso is printed with the usual heavily muscled depiction that the Hulk has always had. The legs are really great though, especially the purple pants. They have slight red lines and the printing runs to the back, with wavy edges to simulate the ripped and tattered nature of these pants post-transformation.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The ATV is neat but nothing really special. The hinges let you simulate the Hulk tearing it in two in a fit of rage. The pieces are all very common, but the sticker sheets are the best. They have Stark, Avenger and Hydra logos that can be used on the vehicle or scattered throughout a MOC&nbsp;or city. I know most people don&#39;t like them, but I like adding touches to bring a scene to like.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set. I love the figure and stickers. I didn&#39;t get this as a GWP&nbsp;when it came out, but got it at a decent price. If you can get it and want to be a completionist, go out and get this one for your collection.&nbsp;</p>
