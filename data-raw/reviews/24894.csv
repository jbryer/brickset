"Wom","2016-01-18T16:26:09.283Z","Brave little off roader, but that's also all there is","<p>In my ever growing collection of these small 3-in-1 Creator sets, the latest addition is this red off road SUV.&nbsp;Are you ready to go on an adventure?</p>

<p>This&nbsp;small box is opened via a punch hole, so there is no way getting around at&nbsp;damaging the box. On the front you see the three possible models to make, making it rather obvious why the Off Road 4x4 is the main model for this set. By far its the best looking and making the best use of the available parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other two are kind of the same, in a way that they both represent some sort of buggy. Neither of those share the flair of the 4x4. Off course are for all three models instructions included. Thanks to the target group of 6-12 years the number of pieces needed per step is low. Meaning everybody can create the models with these instructions.</p>

<p>There is a good variety of parts in this little set. I like the smart use of the part used for the front bumper. You will see this part (in a different color) in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60105-1/Fire-ATV"">2016 Fire ATV</a>&nbsp;for example. The wheels look nice and the small ladder used on the roof makes a great roof rack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building the 4x4 is pretty straight forward. There aren&#39;t really any smart techniques used, all have been done before I guess. Nothing too strange for a smaller model like this, but I own sets which have done a better job at this. The other two alternatives are not worth building to be honest, so the total building time is limited. That&#39;s a pity to be honest, as this is one of the key features of these Creator sets.</p>

<p>Once done the 4x4 reminds me be a bit of the Hummer H1 for some reason. It shares the square approach towards the design and has a &#39;no nonsense&#39; appeal to it. Not sure if red is the best chosen color for an off road 4x4, but it&#39;s a nice twist from what you would expect I guess.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>With only one of the three offered models being really appealing to me, I can only give this set a 3/5 stars rating. It&#39;s one of the strongholds of this series and with only one model I want to build it hurts the build time. Off course you can always make your own creations, but this is up to your own imagination, something I cannot review. I would suggest in looking at the other 2016 Creator models Lego has released, to me those seem like a wiser investment for your money. Then you can get this one at a discount after the summer.&nbsp;</p>
