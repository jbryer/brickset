The various models are all great, but especially the backhoe loader (the tractor with the shovel and digging arm at the back) is such a wonderful little machine. He loves to transport match sticks using the shovel, and the backhoe can actually really &quot;dig&quot; because it has a little bucket. I&#39;m amazed by the playability of such a tiny thing, and can only recommend this cheap set!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I was surprised that it contains 4 wheel base parts in total: 2 grey and 2 black. Other than that, I&#39;m no connoisseur yet in the &quot;what is considered a special part&quot;-division. I think if you buy several of these little Creator boxes,&nbsp;you can build many nice things.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None. The size of these models is much smaller than what would be fitting for a minifig.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As I built the model(s) myself, I can&#39;t say how well a child would fare, but hey, it&#39;s Lego, and this one won&#39;t be too hard to make :-) The building instructions are in the form of folding paper, which is not very handy. You have to put a pencil over the paper to keep it flat.</p>

<p>For me, as an adult, the &quot;building experience&quot; is obviously not the same as it would be for the intended 6-yo and up - I&#39;ve just built the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8043-1/Motorized-Excavator"">8043 Motorized&nbsp;Excavator</a> ^^ - but I guess it&#39;s nice enough.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Three very different models:</p>

<p><strong>1. Backhoe loader</strong></p>

<p>The best model of the bunch, with great playability because it includes a properly articulating shovel and a fully working backhoe. Almost all parts are used for this model.</p>

<p><strong>2. Mining truck</strong></p>

<p>A sturdy looking mining&nbsp;truck; nice, but not really special in my opinion. I haven&#39;t built this one yet, so don&#39;t know how many parts it uses.</p>

<p><strong>3. Telehandler</strong></p>

<p>The least of the three in my opinion, but that might have to do with the pure versatility of the first model. After building this model, there are quite a lot of parts still unused.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A very nice playing set which you won&#39;t regret buying. I&#39;m even going to get another one so we can have two models at the same time. We also have the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31014-1/Power-Digger"">31014-1 Power Digger</a> which is a great complement to this set.</p>

"brickcar","2016-04-10T18:18:34.67Z","A tiny set with great techniques!!!!","<p>Welcome to my first review.I bought this set as a part of my creator car collection which dates back to 2003(with the 4404 Land busters)....When I saw it in the shelves I thought that it was a mediocre set but when I bought it I completely&nbsp;changed &nbsp;my mind.I strongly recommend it due to it&#39;s great price an playability.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small(thinner than that&nbsp;of power digger 31014-1)with a &nbsp;colorful&nbsp;forest background(from 2015 boxes have colorful images but until 2014 the background was colored blue).The box contains a big image of the main,biggest(and best)model,the backhoe loader and two smaller which show the alternatives(a dump truck and a telehander.Both are&nbsp;not so interesting&nbsp;though great for the younger ones who&nbsp;often&nbsp;want to change their model).In the back you can see the 3 models &quot;in action&quot;and on an other&nbsp;side a 1:1 image of one wheel to help you understand the overall size of the model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are common...nothing rare but these yellow slopes are great addition to a collection anyway(if you want to disassemble the model...but I don&#39;t believe this is a good idea as nothing rare is in it)...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are no minifigs in this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I said that when I bought this tiny thing I changed my opinion about it.The build though not challenging&nbsp;contains great techniques and because of them it can be&nbsp;characterized as&nbsp;the best build of a set of it&#39;s size.The front shovel connection uses two car axles(bearing element 2x2),a pair of bad robot arms and two sticks with holder in a great combination...it really expands the possible uses of the axle piece.The term building experience is senseless&nbsp;if you build it from the instruction booklet(which is folded into the box and contains&nbsp;pictures of&nbsp;3 other sets in their front page) if you are a TFOL&nbsp;or Afol but if you try to built it without them is a real challenge!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is adorable.It&#39;s&nbsp;playability is superb&nbsp;with a moving and articulated front and back shovel(the back shovel is also&nbsp;rotating).Moreover the round pieces give a feel of an engine(yeah details!!!),yellow is the catchy suitable color for such machines and last but not least the mudguards of the back wheels complement the model and make it bulkier in a good way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a nice little set with a great technique fitted in,great playability,nice overall appearance&nbsp;and details.I suggest you to buy it!</p>
