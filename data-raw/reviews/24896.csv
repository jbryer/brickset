The last time one&nbsp;was seen in this price range was 2014&#39;s Roaring Power and the previous year&#39;s Highway Speedster, so let&#39;s see how this year&#39;s model stacks up.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>The box has a lovely shot of the main build sports car rapidly cruising down a coastal highway. The secondary builds are displayed off to the side. Much like previous Creator sets, the back of the box shows the three builds interacting in some way, with the truck and skid loader hard at work as the sports car races by with the top down. It also shows how the convertible roof on the sports car retracts and hides beneath the rear panel.</p>

<p>The instructions, like many recent sets, don&#39;t distinguish between blacks and grays very well, which is kind of a pain.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have much in the way of new parts; just about everything here has been seen before.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The construction techniques in the model are quite varied and slightly complex, which is only par for the course in a Creator set. Of note is the interesting method used to build up the mechanism for the folding roof. However, the build is rather hollow, and in some areas leaves an unsightly gap through which you can see right through the model. The yellow liftarm&nbsp;for the folding roof can be a bit bothersome, but it is a necessary sacrifice given how cool the mechanism it is.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is shorter in length than the Highway Speeder and Roaring Power cars, but boy is it fun. Like the Highway Speeder it has opening scissor doors (along with the same problem of them being too high off the ground), and it shares the opening front hood of the Roaring Power sports car. Unlike the engine-less&nbsp;Roaring Power, the Fast Car actually has a flat 6 engine underneath the hood.</p>

<p>The one thing baffling me is the dark gray bumpers. The front bumper in particular is not something like you would see on a normal sports car, especially not in such a color. The dark gray bumpers give the car a more rugged appearance than one might expect. Between the shorter length and the odd bumpers, it seems to give the appearance of a rally car like a modern-day Lancia Stratos. I&#39;m very tempted to give it a few off-road lights and take some outdoor shots.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other two builds look great as well. The truck takes the appearance of an International beast of a vehicle, but doesn&#39;t do much other than roll back and forth. The skid loader fares better with a moving scoop loader and arms.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is by far the best car for this price point so far. It has a much better value for money&nbsp;than the Highway Speeder and Roaring Power sets and also has much more playability than the latter. Like all Creator cars, it also looks amazing on display, especially with the doors and hatches open. Whether you&#39;re looking for a set for a young car fan or just something for yourself, this is easily a must-have set.</p>

Creator sets are always fun to built because of different possibilities. I built and reviewed the main car which is the &quot;Fast Car&quot;. Great built and a cool result for a reasonable prise.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks :</strong> Like all Creator cars this too is fun built, nothing difficult and possible also for kids under 7. The bottom of the car is basicly built with Technic parts, nice how the designers always find different ways to do this. Still nothing spectacular so for a regular Lego builder a 30 minute job.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts 3 bricks :</strong> Almost 4 but I distracted one because of the missing of a minifigure. With a driver included it would have earned one more. All very good parts included like the 4 <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=62361&amp;idColor=3#T=C&amp;C=3"">mudguards </a>and a lot of small round slopes.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks : </strong>Kind of a standard result for Creator set because of the possibility to make 3 different creations. I was thinking of 5 because of the possibilities of the main car. The great way how the roof is hidden under the back space gives it extra value but the lack of the driver made it 4.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks : </strong>A good set for a reasonable price, here in the Netherlands new &euro; 19.00.</p>
