<p>Using this in combination with 7760 Diesel Shunter Locomotive it made a great apperance. Given the wagon is relative short to normal wagon from the 80&#39;s it seemed a bit strange in connection with other freight train wagons.</p>

<p>The baseplate is what makes it unique. The baseplate includes the magnets. The wheels are connected direct to the plate. No additional bricks are used.</p>

<p>The tipper operates simple and manually on both sides. Loading is quite simple and up to 3 4x2 bricks can be transported in each tipper.</p>

<p>I received it as a gift in the late 80&#39;s for my trains. It is a solid build. Therefore there are not a lot bricks used in the set.&nbsp;It took it apart and rebuild it quite few times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The newer version of this tipper wagon is found in the set 7838.</p>
