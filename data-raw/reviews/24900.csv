<p>The 16x16 medium azure plate was slightly curved, the first time I&#39;ve had a damaged or missing part. The replacement parts page was fairly easy to find and use. I was frustrating to wait for the replacement, but I could build a lot without it - all of bags 1/2 and much of bags 3/4/5, and pre-assembled some of the things that go on the river.</p>

<p>I love the detail.</p>

<p>I was a bit confused on what went where, the first time I&#39;ve had even minor difficulty with a build, and I liked the challenge. I had to reverse the roof halves because the slopes were pointing upwards. Much of the set has assemblies that looked like they&#39;d be too hard to disassemble.</p>

<p>The clip and arm setup on the halves of the treehouse was a great idea so the model can be easily rearranged but still stay put. I also liked halves of a hinge being separate colors, a missed opportunity for multipart hinges.</p>

<p>I wish there was enough open space in the river for a raft, to go with 41121. Due to the bridge, it looks too hard to expand with more plates. However, the overall appearance is a great match for that set.</p>

<p>It was a good deal once marked down.</p>

<p>I wanted some of the reddish brown pieces for another part of my collection. My spares were original brown, and that was nice variety, like the official set&#39;s use of reddish brown, dark brown and dark orange. The Joy minidoll was nice as a different character.</p>

<p>As is common for LEGO:<br />
Most instruction steps were small and almost too easy.<br />
It&#39;s frustrating that minidolls can&#39;t sit/lay down, and the furniture with a smooth tile surface doesn&#39;t work.<br />
A bunch of small pieces inflated the piececount.<br />
Friends can go nicely with similarly themed regular LEGO, in this case Hiker from Minifigures Series 16. (Ironically, it was Boy Scout camp experience that got me interested in these girl camp sets)</p>
