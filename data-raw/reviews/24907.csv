<p>In spite of the weird look, the model is interesting: it lifts itself on support wheels, exposing the underside (for repair, I assume). As far as I know, it&#39;s the only Technic model doing this kind of thing, which makes it more fun to build - it&#39;s not just a repeat of usual constructions in other models.</p>

<p>The B model is a dragster, also quite nice.</p>
