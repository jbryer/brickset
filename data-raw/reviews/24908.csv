"DrFrankenstein","2016-12-31T18:58:51.167Z","Nice looks and functions","<p>When I first set eye on this model, I wasn&#39;t sure how it would compare with the rescue helicopter from 2012. The color scheme and the heavy panels decoration sure promised great looks. I was also intrigued by the coaxial rotor mechanism promised by the model. Then again, it&#39;s hard to tell how well the functions are implemented before actually building the model. Happy to report that the model did not disappoint.</p>

<p>The build instruction booklet is of the new style (a single book with glued back spine, instead of multiple booklets with stapled pages), which is nice. It is easy to follow the build steps. There were perhaps 2-3 steps which could have been explained better. For example, at step 108 the arm operating the cargo hatch doors suddenly rotates 90 degrees without any highlighting or explanation how to make it happen (by rotating the worm gear that operates it). Also steps 274/275 leave it to the builder to figure out that the aircraft nose with control panels needs to be pressed forward to slide over the seats after getting attached to the pins. The confusion is momentary and minor though.</p>

<p>The build itself is very pleasant. I particularly enjoyed the cargo bay doors mechanism which avoids the need for a linear actuator in a clever way. Also the coaxial rotors mechanism is very cool. The scale of the model becomes evident in the very early steps of the build when the fuselage begins to take shape. I found the build engaging start to finish.</p>

<p>The finished model looks very nice. While the multitude of panels hide the mechanics inside, they have been used cleverly to provide for a very polished appearance. I like the white and orange color scheme more appealing than the yellow-red colors of http://brickset.com/sets/9396-1 The stickers complete the look nicely. However, my wife thinks that the colors scheme looks outdated (from the 90s) and lacks in coolness.</p>

<p>This heli packs a number of cool functions. The coaxial rotors work very well. I am happy to report that main rotors turning rate is about double the one of the motorized http://brickset.com/sets/9396-1 which was sluggish at best. The sliding rear cargo door is also more responsive. The winch and the lower cargo hatch doors work nicely too. I am not too trilled with the need to use the battery box to control the functions, which seems to be a common criticism of motorized Technic models over the last years. The tail functions (rudders and elevator) are disappointing as there is no way to play with them via a single stick control. The undercarriage is very pleasant however and allows the heli to land and roll smoothly on flat surfaces and turn around easily. Finally, it&#39;s worth noting that the center of weight of the model is approximately beneath the rotors shaft, which makes it suspendable by the rotors (unlike 9396 which is very tail-heavy&nbsp; with a battery box installed).</p>

<p>Overall, I am very pleased with the 42052 helicopter. It looks great and packs a nice selection of functions. There is certainly room for improvement of the model (particular the tail functions and the electric control), but the model is very pleasant overall. This is a strong contender for the title of best Technic helicopter. Personally, I like it even better than the previous 9396 model.</p>

<p>This set features <strong>coaxial main rotor</strong> as its main attraction driven by a medium type Power Function Motor. I probably didn&#39;t pay attention when building the transmission system for the rotor: Mine had considerable friction sometimes even making squeaking noise.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t notice during build that the mechanics to <strong>open the hatch door</strong> is using a set up that I haven&#39;t seen in a set before. Unfortunately, it cannot be regarded once the parts are put together. The panels are blocking the view which I find disappointing.</p>

<p>There is not much to say about <strong>open/close of the rear door</strong>.</p>

<p>The fourth motorized function is a <strong>winch</strong> where the hook can be lowered through the hatch.</p>

<p>All of these motorized functions are controlled by two levers that engage the transmission, e.g. maximum of two operations can run simultaneously.<br />
The big let down is that direction of the motor/function can only be reversed using the switch on the battery box on the bottom below the cockpit.</p>

<p>The front wheel of the <strong>landing gear</strong> rotates freely. The pivot is off-axis so turning is very easy when the helicopter is pushed on the ground even on rough terrain.</p>

<p>As this is a coaxial rotor setup there is no tail rotor. The designers added <strong>pitch</strong> and <strong>side rudder</strong> to the tail. The first can be operated by a lever that is located nearby and underneath the tail. The side rudder is flapping freely, e.g. lacking any control. It seems that these features were added but given little attention regarding playability.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The built of the model is interesting: You&#39;ll start with the gear box and working towards the main cabin. The tail is assembled seperately and then fixed to the chassis. At the end the model is covered on the top side.</p>

<p>I decided to have a different colour scheme on mine using all sorts of green panels:</p>

<p><img alt=""colour variant"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42052/05_wr_16923k.jpg"" style=""width: 480px; height: 293px;"" /></p>

<p>The size of the finished model is just a little bit longer than set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9396-1/"">9396</a> (width is similar).</p>

<h3>My Rating</h3>

<p>The rotor and landing gear are nicely defined. Bay doors and winch suggest playability which I don&#39;t see: The model is just too big (also heavy) to be (firmly) held by one hand and perform any operation with the second. I wouldn&#39;t pick it up on the tail only although it is firmly build.</p>

<p>To me there is disproportion in size of pilot cabin and motor-and-gear section on top of the helicopter. The latter appears too high (big) with respect to the pilots seats. Maybe this is due to the darker colour scheme compared to the original model. Still, engines with the white covers are good looking.</p>
