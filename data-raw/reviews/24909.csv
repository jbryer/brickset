"gloslegofan","2016-08-03T22:52:12.02Z","Review of the optional PF Functions","<p>I have written this review about the optional PF functions. Huw has written a very good review of the main set itself. The ratings are based on the main set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions for how to integrate PF (using the Power&nbsp;Functions&nbsp;Set 8293) are included at the back of the main (and only) instruction booklet. There are 30 steps.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The PF elements (not included in the main set) that are used are the AA Battery Box, the PF Medium Motor and the PF Lights.</p>

<p>The blue 1x6 Pneumatic Pump that was installed during the main build but left dormant is used to provide the air flow when driven by the PF Medium Motor. Therefore the new manual&nbsp;blue Pneumatic Pump is redundant when using the motorised&nbsp;pump, but it is left in place in the model.</p>

<p>There are approximately 7 beams, 4 axles, 1 Lever and a number of other smaller parts that are unused from the set when PF functions are added.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The conversion to PF is fiddly and slightly time consuming, but overall I don&#39;t see this as too much of a bad thing as building is surely the best part of the Lego experience!</p>

<p>The first 10 steps are removing parts that aren&#39;t needed or need to be removed temporarily.</p>

<p>Adding the motor was a little tricky as there isn&#39;t much room, I found some tubes needed pushing out of the way. Attention to detail is needed to make sure you disconnect and connect the correct tubes, and thread the PF wires through the correct gaps. The reason for the &#39;2x2 plate with vertical snap&#39; in the main build becomes clear as it now holds the 2x2 connecting brick that is used in the PF Lights wire, and rises up along with the cab.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The PF functionality is good but not perfect. The motor can struggle a little if all of the pneumatic levers are in &#39;neutral&#39; for too long. I was a little surprised that the system can&#39;t cope very well when trying to use more than one pneumatic function at once. The use of the PF lights works well.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I think it is great that the model can be converted to using PF as this adds &#39;build time&#39; and I am sure many Technic enthusiasts will have spare PF kit. But once the PF is added I don&#39;t believe the set is any more enjoyable, and I suspect I will be converting back to the non-PF version at some point!</p>

"MarquisDeStade","2016-10-06T02:42:19.4Z","My First Technic set in 35 years","<p>Due to changes in my life and a good income, I&#39;ve decided on impulse to buy a set of Classic bricks (790 pieces 10698) on Amazon.</p>

<p>After receiving it and being given a jolt of childhood, I looked at the Lego site and noticed all the good looking models being offered in the Technic line. My only Technic and also last&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;kit had been the Car Chassis 853. Suddenly&nbsp;, I had to reconnect to these models.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since I mostly want to do MOCs of planes, tanks, trucks and cars,&nbsp;I decided to order&nbsp;the Technic models Fire Plane (42040) and the Crawler Crane 42042 for the parts and to rekindle making these challenging sets. I was expecting these two to come right before a weekend but by Friday EOD, they had not come. Nothing worse than delayed hopes when you have a craving. Located nearest store selling toys, headed there and looked at the options. The&nbsp;Volvo EW160E&nbsp;had the right look, size and price (149$ CDN)</p>

<p>Bought it home then started the unpacking for a nice 5 hour Lego session</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box looks nice, everything neatly packed. Instructions were clear, did not feel overwhelmed by the task.</p>

<p>Some instructions can be a bit unclear once build is more advanced. Small locking details can be lost when the manual shows a full model with all the pieces jumping at you from the pages. However, this build had no instruction errors I could detect.</p>

<p>(On a side note,&nbsp;after 3 Technic models made in a short span of time, I am a bit &nbsp;annoyed by one little thing in the&nbsp;instructions arrangement. I think all the pieces needed to make certain multiple features should be listed as a single list instead of&nbsp;being listed at every assembly section. )</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I have to admit it was a shock to discover the multiple pieces now included in these sets. Remember, my last Technic model was the 853 Car Chassis. Not your granpa&#39;s&nbsp;Lego anymore.</p>

<p>The amazement did not stop once I started building it. The multiple kinds of gears, connectors, slanted parts, bright colors and weird one-off pieces kept me amused all through&nbsp;the build</p>

<p>No parts were missing or broken. Same quality has I&#39;ve known as a kid</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was really fun. I really enjoyed working on the pneumatic set-up to power the crane&#39;s arm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would not call it challenging because the instructions are clear and really streamlined without omitting any details</p>

<p>It took me around 10 hours to finish it in a two days effort.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like it. Looks good, has a compact heft, does not feel fragile or badly designed.</p>

<p>Playing is quite fun. You do have to get used to the pneumatic controls but after 10&nbsp;minutes of play, you get the gist of it</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A good looking fun model. Definitely a good one for an adult rekindling an old passion</p>

	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42121-1"">42121</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(This is my fifth review on excavators from the list.)</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>From the technic sets released in second half of 2016 this is the one I had put on top of my (wish) buying list.<br />
It features two of the same 2x11 large pneumatic cylinders (tagged v2) as in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42043-1"">42043</a> plus a small one There is a new hand pump in blue.</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>The mostly black with yellow patches colour scheme from the original machine is is an eye catcher.<br />
However, at closer look designers have done a bad job: Within the model they are using many differently coloured parts next to each other giving the model a rather unclean finish. this may be owed to the paerts list of the second(ary) model but I don&#39;t like it on the excavator.</p>

<p>Parts count for this model is similar to 8043 motorized excavator. I didn&#39;t put them next to each other but the 42053 appears to be narrower.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>There are three functions in the undercarriage:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Steering of one axle, operated by a 20-tooth gear opposite to the shield</li>
	<li>Shield can be lowered and raised by means of a lever next to it. There is a clear lock mechanism that raised the model from the (steered) wheel.</li>
	<li>Pair of stabilizers. There is no transmission to operated them. Only a short beam on each that locks the main support in place.</li>
</ul>

<p>The undercarriage appears to be rather empty - this is the space where the battery box is locate if power functions (compressor plus light) are added.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The arm can be raised and lowered by one of the large cylinders. There is a second one to bend it. Rather unique compared to the other excavators is that the shovel could be lowered -far- beyond the ground level of the model.</li>
	<li>The clam shell shovel is operated by a small pneumatic cylinder.</li>
	<li>Pneumatic pressure is supplied by a manually operated pump.</li>
	<li>Inside the model there is a small pump that can be driven by the PF motor. Only small change to pneumatic tubing is required and that is readily prepared during build of the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last the cabin can be raised and lowered. This adds little to playability. You would probably find that on scrap yards. But there a claw as in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42006-1"">42006</a> would be used.</p>

<p>The superstructure can is fixed to the undercarriage by means of four pins similar to other models. It can therefore easily be attached to tracked bases from 8294 or 42006.</p>

<h3>Comparison</h3>

<p>This is a nice model that certainly looks much more realistic than 8851. The orange elements add to this. Especially the arm in black is modeled very well. But the designers should have given more attention to pneumatic tubing: It has a very untidy look.</p>

<p>It would not have hurt to put the shovel on a small turntable so that it can be rotated.</p>

<p>For playability I would prefer not to have to pneumatic switches operated left-right. It does not give the right feeling of operation: back-and-forth would IMHO have been better set-up.</p>

<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<h3>Modifications</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Tidy up colour manifold in undercarriage.</li>
	<li>Put shovel on small turntable.</li>
	<li>Change orientation of pneumatic switches.</li>
	<li>Add air tank filled by motorised pump.</li>
	<li>(Minor) Cleanup pneumatic tubing.</li>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2017-07-16T22:51:13.093Z","My First Pneumatics Set","<p>For as long as I can remember, I only ever had two criteria for Technic vehicles: it must have a working engine, and it must have suspension. Period. To me, those were the things which gave a set&nbsp;the most playability and appeal. Then recently, I went back and took a closer look at pneumatic sets like the legendary 8455. Finally, I came across the Volvo EW160E at the Lego Store and quickly became attracted, and ended up gifting&nbsp;myself this set for Christmas last year.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve been seeing pneumatic sets have become rarer in recent years with the advent of electrically-driven actuators. Since the release of the new V2 pneumatic system only 2 sets (including the EW160E) have made use of pneumatics, the other being 42043 in 2015. Therefore, I thought it would be worthwhile to obtain my own copy in case I missed the opportunity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For completeness sake, I would like to mention some basic differences between the old and new systems. The first is that the inlet&nbsp;and outlet ports&nbsp;on all cylinders and switches are narrowed at the tips to make it easier to put the hoses in place. The other new feature is the introduction of an 11L cylinder (which can be big or small)&nbsp;and a new type of pump.</p>

<p>Build time was approximately 10 hours (?) and remained interesting throughout with little repetition. As I&#39;m sure many would agree, care must be taken during assembly of the pneumatic system to ensure that all the hoses go into the correct ports.</p>

<p>The pneumatic system without a doubt operates on the arm. The&nbsp;arm consists of two sections, the main arm and forearm,&nbsp;which can be operated independently of one another. The main arm is controlled by the large cylinder adjacent to the cab which is in charge of raising and lowering the entire arm. The main arm further consists of 2 sections which are rigidly fixed at a&nbsp;certain angle with respect to one another. The large cylinder sitting on top of the main arm controls the raising and lowering of the forearm. Finally, the small cylinder at the end controls opening and closing of the clamshell bucket.</p>

<p>Operations of the pneumatic system is achieved through the switches at the rear. A blue pump immediately behind the arm supplies air to the system. The left switch controls the main arm, the middle switch controls the forearm, and the right switch controls the bucket. Switching the lever in the left position for both arm-related controls will lower, while right lever positions will raise. For the bucket, left position closes the clamshells while right position opens them. In all cases the middle (neutral) position shuts off air access and whatever air pressure was inside the 3 systems beforehand will be retained. Grey hoses are responsible for extending the cylinders while black hoses retract them. Blue hoses supply air from the pump to the 3 independent systems. The maze of hoses is nicely tucked behind body panels. The top panels at the back and right side can be opened to access the hoses&nbsp;underneath.</p>

<p>There is a separate hose and cylinder which are only used if power functions are applied. Otherwise, they sit there and provide no function.</p>

<p>The vehicle can be lifted and stabilized through two rear outriggers and the front blade. For the front blade, stability is achieved when the light grey angle connector is propped against the blue 3L pin. The outriggers are very stable; however, intervention is required to keep the front blade from collapsing during pumping. You can simply use your thumb and index finger to push the grey angle connector up against the pin so that it doesn&#39;t snap loose out of position.</p>

<p>The superstructure can be rotated about 330 degrees, done purposely so such that nothing gets tangled in case you want to integrate power functions. Steering can be done through a large gear at the lower back of the vehicle. The cab can be lowered and raised through a worm gear system, operated by a knob behind the cab.</p>

<p>The pneumatics operate very smoothly and can physically pick up and drop off objects. It requires some getting used to to memorize which switch positions do what, but after a while it becomes easy to master. When the main arm is lowered, it tends to drop quickly due to self-weight, but this can be controlled better through gradual opening of the valve. Keeping the main arm raised indefinitely isn&#39;t possible since the weight will cause air pressure to slowly dissipate. Additionally, after a while of inactivity, opening or closing the bucket usually requires some patience since it is located furthest away from the pump, making it the most difficult to reintroduce air pressure to that location. As a result, it usually takes several pumps and a couple seconds waiting before you can see any response from the clamshells.&nbsp;The arm has very good reach and can extend well below ground level, and can even reach underneath the table directly below the vehicle. Lastly, when the main arm is fully raised and the forearm is fully lowered, you won&#39;t be able to raise or lower the cab since the clamshells will get in the way.</p>

<p>The only thing that was frustrating was the stickers since there were so many small ones needed to be aligned perfectly. I personally don&#39;t mind the colour scheme so long as it is true to the actual EW160E. Official images show some models where the orange components are actually supposed to be orange, so no complaints there.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a solid pneumatics set and well worth the $150 CAD.</p>

"canbayram","2017-10-31T08:10:04.507Z","Caused me get back to LEGO after a long time","<p>I am 31 years old and I grew up playing with LEGO SYSTEM sets as a kid. My love for LEGO never diminished but LEGO is not cheap for sure so I never had a Technic Set; until almost one year ago when I saw this set at Toyzz Shop in Turkey, where I live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I always thought I should start collecting Technic Sets - I purchased the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42022-1/Hot-Rod"">42022-1 Hot Rod</a>&nbsp;back in 2014 - and this set which was on the top shelf really caught my eye. I hesitated for a bit but my wife encouraged me to buy it and she decided to buy it as a present for&nbsp;me. We headed back home immediately because it would be getting back to world of LEGO and it meant a lot to me. I really thank my wife because she caused me to express the AFOL in me who was idle for a loooong time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I opened the box and took out the unnumbered bags, 4 pieces of 56x26 tyres&nbsp;and the instruction book which was around 250 pages. It did not include the B model but you could download the manual from the internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It took me 6 hours to build it! I realized I got rusty through those years. Actually I didn&#39;t rush building it. I wanted to enjoy every second of the building process and it was completely fun. There wasn&#39;t any repetitive steps or unenjoyable moments that I can remember.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After completing the set I searched the internet and saw that the LEGO version is &quot;almost&quot; completely the same as the real thing! OK, that is the thing about LEGO but this one seemed almost the same for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When it came to test the playability it was fun alright but it lacked something. The pneumatic system always got my attention and now I had it in my hand, even the V2 but then I learned that the lack of reservoir was a bit problem, it is OK anyway. There aren&#39;t many pneumatic sets but you can get the use of it in your own creations somehow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next week I took it apart to build the B model. Oh man, taking it apart is another story. You can understand that the structure is quite robust when taking it apart. I was used to system sets all my life, so it was quite easy to destruct them but Technic sets? You can&#39;t just destroy or take them apart. You need to almost &quot;unbuild&quot; them. However that is another part of the fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the B model is as good looking and functioning as the A model. You use less parts and you use only 2 of the 3 pneumatic valves in B model. Although it is quite handsome, it didn&#39;t take a long time to take it apart to build the A model once again. And can you believe it took me almost half the time to build the A model again :D&nbsp;</p>

<p>I highly recommend this set because it has the Pneumatic System V2 elements&nbsp;(2 big pneumatic cylinders, 1 small pneumatic cylinder, a hand pump, a pneumatic pump and 3 pneumatic switches), lots of different elements for your own creations. You also have the chance to attach power functions if you have it lying around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is my first review and I will try to add&nbsp;reviews to the other sets that I own as well (starting with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42063-1/BMW-R-1200-GS-Adventure"">42063-1: BMW R 1200 GS Adventure</a>&nbsp;which I bought 2 days ago waiting to be built at home). See you guys in another review.&nbsp;</p>
