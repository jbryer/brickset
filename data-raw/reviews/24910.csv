"Kcko","2016-09-18T12:53:01.623Z","This Claas Tractor is simply great :-)","<p>Hello LEGO funs,</p>

<p>I have two kids, both LEGO funs. Tractors, garbage trucks&nbsp;and all that staff especially. Decision to buy this set was made just after first info release. Then we try to avoid any other info about any detail&nbsp;including all functionalities. Just to have bigger surprise from unboxing to first rides.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box has nice pictures on both sides which really&nbsp;attract&nbsp;you. Instructions are clear.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>cool</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>none</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Set was build by my older son, 8,5 years old. I helped occasionally to pull or push or adjust&nbsp;something. My role is to sort, search and general service... &nbsp;;-)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Is amazing! Moving arm and cabin is so cool with all its gears. It was mainly operated by my younger son, 2,5 years old.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great.&nbsp;Definitely in our Top 10. We are now looking forward to motorize the&nbsp;steering&nbsp;and at least two wheels :-)</p>

"AyCarrumba","2016-09-23T17:31:29.38Z","A Claasy Tractor with lots of Fun functions!","<p>Big Technic sets are my bag, baby! But this Tractor was never on my hit list - something about the look of it just failed to inspire me to buy it. What DID inspire me to buy it was a brief listing at &pound;80 on Amazon. Did I suffer impulse purchase regret? Read on to find out.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard big box with strong images of the Tractor and its functions. It&#39;s pleasingly full.</p>

<p>The instructions are a single bound book, with a panel at the back with some specs of the &#39;real thing&#39;. They are as ever simple to follow.</p>

<p>I did (I think) spot one rare error in the instructions: On page 154 it instructs you to align the upper switch along with the main direction control clutch, when it is in fact the lower switch that operates the clutch and the upper one switches the battery box on and off. It&#39;s a minor detail but it could cause frustration if you got it wrong.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some great parts in this set. Of course there are the realistic V tread wheels, three turntables (two large and one small) and an M motor and battery box if you don&#39;t have six already like me. There are 3 small linear actuators. I actually count the lack of an engine as a plus, as I&#39;m simply bored of building that same 20 year old design by now! There are a good number of panels and a surprising amount of gears tucked away as well as 3 sets of clutches (2 in the Crane). Note that beyond the hub knuckles there are no specialist steering or suspension components. In fact it even lacks differential cages and only comes with 2 CV joints so you can&#39;t (easily) make a 4WD Drivetrain from this set alone. I noticed a slight colour mismatch on some of the neon green beams, as if they&#39;re from separate batches.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build differs markedly from 42042 (Crawler Crane) and 42043 (AROCS Truck) in that it is much less modular. The Chassis and body of the 42054 CLAAS are built in one large unit with only a few small subsections like the cab being added on. The Crane is a distinctly separate entity, with it&#39;s own build, as it connects to the Tractor as an &#39;accessory&#39;. Nevertheless the build is highly engaging and actually I think the well modeled exterior does the level of engineering inside a disservice because you can&#39;t see what is going on at first hand. What is going on is extremely clever, even if it does push the limits of Lego strength in my opinion. The other recent &#39;big sets&#39; 42042, 42043, and the Mobile Crane MKII are all characterised by exceptionally clever and detailed gearboxes forming the heart of the models functionality. This model takes a different tack and the main steering functions are driven by a lever. The Gearboxes are distributed throughout the model, and perhaps the most impressive is in the crane accessory. It takes a single power input from the power take off and adds a reverser and splits it two ways as well. It&#39;s simple, but very, very clever.&nbsp; And the control switches are well laid out as well!<br />
<br />
Throughout the build this tractor really won me over. There&#39;s a lot going on in there, and in interesting ways as well. Like the other &#39;big sets&#39; it will blow your mind with the level of engineering on display for what is just a &#39;toy&#39;. The Cosmetics look great and never feel like a chore despite the level of detail. The cab and bonnet have some innovative techniques in them to achieve the right look which keeps things interesting.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Here it is in all its glory:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/Oeg4lN1.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 728px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/9xQG3jf.jpg"" /></p>

<p>This builds into a very playable, very functional model. The Crane is actually excellent fun to play with and the combination of hand controls and powered functions are fun, rather than feeling like a let down. It may be yet another crane in Technic, but it&#39;s sufficiently compact and different in construction to be worthwhile. The cab rotation works very well and the way it pops up, then settles back down is very pleasing. It is flimsy though.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><br />
<br />
On the plus side, it looks great, has great wheels, and the implementation of the steering method is ingenious. It has more functionality that it&#39;s looks suggest, and the power take offs are just itching for builders to add their own creations and attachments. I&#39;d like to build a balloon tyred tipper trailer, for example. It is fun to play with. If you like tractors, it is a very worthwhile set.<br />
<br />
However, There are some small issues with this model. The down sides are minor: The steering implementation is slightly flawed, in my opinion. There&#39;s a friction pin at the very heart of it that may be there to control lash, or it may just be the only part that can do the job, but it introduces friction and limits to lock of the rear wheels. In turn, the vehicle isn&#39;t as manoeverable as it feels like it should be with four wheel steering and a short wheelbase. The steering friction also manifests itself in difficulty turning the gear behind the cab to steer it and the reaction torque can actually rotate the cab instead of the wheels! The B model also feels slightly disappointing because it&#39;s a simple reworking of the accessory and I&#39;m sure that there are a wealth of other CLAAS vehicles that could be created - but perhaps they didn&#39;t want to tread on the toes of another tie in.</p>

<p>In Conclusion, I am very pleased with this set, particularly at &pound;80. A &pound;120 I&#39;m not totally convinced and I&#39;d take a discounted AROCS or Crawler Crane before I paid that much for it. It shows a great depth of engineering, builds a very solid model that is realistic and functional, and provides a good haul of parts to build other creations so at the right price, or for tractor fans, I&#39;m sure you won&#39;t be disappointed.<br />

"martiniman","2016-10-13T20:57:34.333Z","Stunning tractor with awesome new wheels","<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The 42054 Claas Xerion Trac is in my opinion the best Technic set of the H2 releases for 2016. It beats the flagship 42056, no doubt. The tractor looks as realistic as possible in Lego, it has very interesting mechanisms, the built is super fun and the price is a no brainer. For 130&euro; this is little more than a third of the 42056 money, yet you get nearly as many bricks, with similar awesome big wheels. The only drawback is the crane. It is no big deal, as the tractor invites to develop custom add-ons. You can easily come up with a better crane, and that is what I did.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42054-0.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Unboxing and manual</h3>

<p>The box is 80% full, and the first thing you notice when you put it upside down are the big tires. The book is Volvo Loader style, like most recent 500+ brick models. It is very clear and shows a picture of the real Xerion in the back, and 3 pictures of the other &quot;flagship&quot; sets of this season.</p>

<p><br />
<img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42054-1.jpg"" style=""width: 1064px; height: 708px;"" /></p>

<p>Personally I am not a big fan of the single book approach when a built is modular. It really limits multi-person builds. Three books for chassis, bodywork/cabin and crane would have been easier for me.</p>

<h3>New pieces</h3>

<p>The first thing that makes a stellar impression are the four wheels. They do breath tractor all over, but as soon as you put in black rims, they become monster truck wheels. These wheels should be mount on your 41999 right away. It totally fits the look.</p>

<p>You also get 2 new panel sizes in lime green. Panel 1/2 and 5/6 are new in this colour. The 3/4 panels are used before. You also get a single black Panel Angular 3X5X3, used on the hood. These are used on the Volvo excavator as well.</p>

<p>Other noticeable pieces are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>4 black wheel bearing pieces, as used on the front axle of the 42056</li>
	<li>4 red parabola 6x6 discs, much sought after for the ferris wheel.</li>
	<li>4 red rims 56x34</li>
	<li>10 I-beam frames!</li>
	<li>3 turntables, 2 of them the new big ones introduced in the Arocs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Building experience</h3>

<p>The Xerion delivers an awesome building experience. It is massive, with over 1900 pieces, yet it never gets repetitive. It is also very rewarding: finishing the awesome steering mech, finishing the rotating cab, finishing the paneling, making the attachments: all is very much fun to build.</p>

<p>The greatest part of the building is that you see a lot of stuff being put in place that leaves you puzzled. Until you finish the tractor, you can only guess what you are building, but then all fits into place. Take for example the parts that make the cabin pop up while rotating. It is such a clever mechanism.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This is where the Xerion excels. Where the 42056 is a car made for the building experience and to showcase, this tractor is actually fun to play with. You have a motor built in to operate the cabin, and 2 functions of the crane. You can also build custom attachments and have them operated by the PTO axle running the full length of the tractor.</p>

<p>The most fun is had with the cabin. It is such a ingenious mechanism, it really appeals every time you turn the lever on the right side. You can override motorized operation any time by hand: very easy alternative for quick turns.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42054-6.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Also interesting is the impressive steering mechanism. It allows normal, crab and 4-wheel steering. Because of the large tires, the operation is a little stiff. You should operate the mech preferably on a flat smooth surface. On anything less smooth, even on a wooden table, the risk is that turning the steering gear on the back of the cabin turns the cabin instead of the wheels.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42054-2.jpg"" style=""width: 1064px; height: 708px;"" /></p>

<p>The crane works well with the 2 operation levers on the back. It is Crawler-crane style gearing: you don&#39;t have to reverse the battery to change the direction of operation: the gearbox has both an up and down position for both linear actuators.</p>

<p>Another well done part is the attachment lifters. The frames are pretty sturdy, and the height adjusting works great. Where the linear actuator easily rattles on the crane, they don&#39;t suffer on heavy attachments. It is nice how the pins with gears lock the attachment and double as lifting operators.</p>

<h3>Looks</h3>

<p>This is one of the best realistic Technic models ever. It is made with much love for details. The proportions are right, the colours are spot on, the details are well done. The air inlets on the hood, the chair with board computer, a fire extinguisher, the wheel following mud guards, all the lights, the cabin: all are beautifully converted into technic bricks. The model is sturdy, there are no unnecessary gaps, and it looks realistic from every direction.</p>

<p>As with the best Technic models, this one looks spot on without stickers applied. Keeping the stickers off is my preferred finish, and on this Claas you won&#39;t miss them a second. The stickers are small and not very visible. The white with red CLAAS logo ones on the hood are the most noticeable stickers, but the looks without are better. Too bad LEGO did not print the 2x2 board computer tile, they have a similar computer screen tile in white.</p>

<h3>To crane or not to crane</h3>

<p>The default add-on for the Xerion is a red crane. The real model this crane is inspired upon is the so called Xerion Forrest Edition. But it looks nowhere like the real thing. The real lumber crane folds in, has a decent telescopic extension and is pretty compact. Here the gearbox alone makes the add-on come in weird proportions. The range is almost futile: you can only pick up logs that lay close to the base of the crane. The linear actuator in the crane struggles on minor loads. It must be the reason this 42054 comes with a very tiny play-log, where the old 9397 logging truck had a much bigger log to play with. Even though the operation handles work great, with a nice 2x2way gearbox, the crane is a failure.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42054-3.jpg"" style=""width: 1064px; height: 708px;"" /></p>

<p>So we built a new crane. A little bit limited by the size of usable parts (it has become a tad larger than we wanted), Arocs pneumatics really offer the needed range to build a strong and decent range crane. It was a big puzzle to use why the extension bar element from the Arocs was not used on this one. Instead, LEGO used a regular steering toothed bar on a red liftarm. We used the Arocs part, and made it dual action: the red Arocs element glides inside a shell of red curved panels. We tried to capture the true folding operation of the real Forrest Edition: the way the crane extends, the range, the way the gripper hangs on the tip. It worked out pretty well, and the looks are nice. Albeit a bit large to our taste, the range is realistic. It reaches from pretty far to pretty high.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42054-4.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Great thing is the Xerion remains stable, even with the crane holding a load and being rotated into the most awkward position (90&deg; from the driving direction). The PTO frames can hold both heavy cranes with ease.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/42054-5.jpg"" style=""width: 1064px; height: 708px;"" /></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>All together, I can say the Claas is the best Technic 2016H2 set. Why?</p>

<p><strong>The good:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Stunning realistic looking Claas tractor</li>
	<li>Nice lemon green and white accents, the red crane completes the nice colour palette</li>
	<li>Awesome tractor tires, doing equally well as 41999 Monster Truck tires</li>
	<li>Great built, with lots of interesting mechanics</li>
	<li>Great feel: heavy and sturdy</li>
	<li>Awesome mechanics: the steering, the cab rotation, the PTO system, all very well done</li>
	<li>Invites to build custom PTO add-ons. You can make it into any tractor system you like</li>
	<li>Great playability. The cab rotation, the great crane PTO control mech, the operation of the battery box: all is done very well</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The bad:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Steering is too stiff. It makes the cabin turn around occasionally instead of the wheels.</li>
	<li>Lever to switch steering type is hard to operate</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The ugly:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The crane is really ugly. It is weak and it has a totally useless range of operation. It does consist of a lot of nice parts, that gives a lot of options to build a crane of your own.</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s also a great store of parts. &nbsp;I don&#39;t mind the red crane, but the intention clearly seems to be that the parts are used to build your own ideas. &nbsp;Here&#39;s my small contribution, a plough&nbsp;like the one from 8859:</p>

"castlespad","2017-01-23T12:11:30.847Z","Class Zerion 5000 Tractor","<p>This is my first review. Just had to pass on my experience with this set. Let&#39;s cut to the quick......excellent, fabulous, amazing, satisfying, great value. This could have easily been a flagship set. If you are thinking about buying, just do it.</p>

<p>The parts are separated into 2 bags, one for the tractor build the other for the plough/ crane assembly. The finish on the pieces is lovely and this green colour is striking. A little time sorting the pieces will save a lot of frustration later.</p>

<p>The instructions are simple to follow and yet easy to make a mistake if not careful and it can be easy to confuse colour selection of some parts; as I did.</p>

<p>There is very little that is repetitive and the build intrigues as it develops. There are few large parts which means that the chassis is packed with the ingredients to make this tractor function. The tractor unit is not too large when completed and is brought into perspective with the final addition of the &#39;floating&#39; cab that lifts and revolves under the power of the motor. The battery unit is housed under the tractor hood that is hinged and held raised with a bonnet &#39;stay&#39; giving easy access. The on/off battery switch is connected by an array of levers to the operating side&nbsp;panel which conveniently is adjacent to the cab control switch.</p>

<p>A lever housed behind the cab provides the manual selection of three positions that controls the overall movement of the wheel action whilst the steering is controlled from a cog wheel easily accessible behind the cab.</p>

<p>It is obvious that someone will find a way to add remote control and motors to power the wheels on this model.</p>

<p>A lot is&nbsp;said about transfers - I have applied these. There are enough to make the set more attractive without being OTT.</p>

<p>I should say that there were a couple of parts missing from the set. This was easily remidied with the Lego contact information and has not detracted from the build experience.</p>

<p>The great&nbsp;thing is that I can now move on to build the crane as the tractor makes a &#39;stand alone&#39; unit with a power axel to drive the attachments.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed the build and I am delighted with the finished product. Well done Lego - more like this please. Top marks, top design, top model.</p>

"Jeeves77","2017-05-04T17:11:49.443Z","(Lost) opportunity. ","<p><strong>Building experience:</strong></p>

<p>I dare say I&#39;m an experienced builder, and the build was both enjoyable and mostly problem free. I made one mistake (mounted the central turntable upside down - a common mistake), which luckily was easily remedied.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say, that the build is not complicated, and the lower end of the&nbsp;age range&nbsp;is maybe even on the low side, but for an experienced AFOL&nbsp;the process is quite&nbsp;straightforward.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Nice collection of light green and white pieces, as well as a lot of gearbox pieces&nbsp;and obviously, the tires are fantastic and make up for some shortcomings.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>This is, IMHO, a disaster. I was attracted to this set (because I&#39;ve spent my childhood&#39;s summers in farm country and love tractors) because of the potential to build stuff which can be attached to such a machine. Combined with the front-and-back PTO&#39;s I thought this set had a lot of potential for personalized development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alas, the set has some serious shortcomings. The biggest shortcoming is related to steering. Naturally, the selectable four-wheel steering (including crab-functionality) makes the steering arrangement heavy (needing significant force), but most troublesome is that the hand-of-god steering is integrated into the rotating cab, which not only is not ergonomic, but also means that as you need force to turn the knob, you mostly also turn the cab. The steering also suffers from (again, IMHO) wheels which do not turn enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The machine being a tractor, independent suspension is not something you&#39;d expect, but a total lack of suspension (not even a swinging axle, like in the 42030 wheel loader) is in my opinion not okay for a set in this size and price class.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not criticizing the turning cab, but I do feel that having that as a motorized function is somewhat unnecessary (I&#39;d maybe have used the gearbox to control raising and lowering front- &nbsp;or back attachment points)</p>

<p>Considering the default implement (A-model;&nbsp;arm and grabber) there is something amiss. Firstly, the playability suffers from a combination of motorized and manual (making actual playing awkward) functions, but more problematically, the rotating function tends to creep even when not engaged (I&#39;ll take it apart and build it again, so as to ensure it is not something I produced, but I doubt it)</p>

<p><strong>Value for money:</strong></p>

<p>Could be worse, could be better. The set is not overpriced, but the mere M-motor puts some definite limits on the implements you could attach.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Being an AFOL, an a technic-crazy at that, this set definitely has its pro&#39;s, but as I also have two kids who like to play with what I&#39;ve built, the lackluster playability is a major drawback.&nbsp;</p>

"frost1989","2018-02-11T05:57:15.9Z","COOL CLAAS","<p>Appearance<br />
I gotta say, this is the best looking licensed technic vehicle LEGO has ever offered, the entire appearance, eg. the cabin and the hood are carefully designed to make it very true to the real Claas Xerion 5000, given enough charming point, from far, it looks rather like a diecast model than a LEGO&#39;s proud creation.</p>

<p>I love the cool stickers that enhance the beauty of 42054, and of course the big big tyres and wheels that conquered my heart. (Im a sucker on big bossy tyres)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the red logging arm attachment that comes with it is a failure to me, it looks super crude, unfinished paired with disappointing functions, I never once built the crane after I owned this 42054 for quite long time, I had it turn into the silage plow instead, love to use it to sweep my piles of bricks.</p>

<p>Functions<br />
Lets talk about the steering, it has three modes, and the crab steering system is the highlight of this model, while praising the designer&#39;s impressive technic engineering skills, the steering system has its big flaw that you can&#39;t ignore, the steering is so stiff and every time you turn the wheels, the force you had to put makes the cab loosing and turning at the same time too, which is a big disappointment IMHO.</p>

<p>The front and rear pto is a plus for people love to have its own moc attachment, under the somewhat flimsy bonnet, reveal the battery box that is easy to remove for switching batteries. There&#39;s one thing I have to complaint tho, is that you can hardly place more than two power functions on the battery box simply because the bonnet cannot fit more than three of connector bricks, I had add a pair of lights and that&#39;s the limit for the bonnet, any extra PF connector&nbsp;and the bonnet will no longer fit.</p>

<p>Overall<br />
Despite all of its shortcomings, this 42054 is still my most favorite technic vehicle I will love for many years to come, the price is reasonable enough for its decent parts and the lovely tyres. I would recommend this to friends out there who love authentic look technic vehicle with impressive size. 42054 is the technic set you will easily fall in love with, well, unless, at the case you don&#39;t like lime color. =P</p>

"legomandre42082","2018-11-21T01:24:26.07Z","Ideal Tractor for any farm!","<h2><strong>A realistic tractor for any Technic fan!</strong></h2>

<p>For a while, I was scouring the Lego website for the ideal set with power functions, to add to my Technic collection. I had seen various reviews by trust-worthy reviewers and knew I&nbsp;needed this set in my life. It was the first&nbsp;power functions et in my collection, and I must say I was not even close to disappointed. The complexity and intricacy within the set speaks miles about the level of detail for all of their projects. It is such a unique feat of engineering and amazing to build.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The functions within the set made it stand-out from all previous Technic models. There are three main components to the functionality of the set: two automatic and one manual. The only manual function is the steering mechanism. There are three features to the steering: moving both of the axles in the same direction (making it move in the same direction), front axles move and back don&#39;t, and finally both set of axles move in opposite directions. This is such an incredible function to construct in this et and makes it so unique. The first automatic function is flicking a switch, on the right side of the vehicle, to move the driving cab. It is a flawless and really intricate function that is very satisfactory to build. Finally, the last automatic function consists of a crane in the back that can either move in a full circle or move up and down. These two functions can be done simultaneously and while the cab is in use. This is done by having the crane run&nbsp; through a driveshaft on the bottom of the Tractor. I really enjoy these multitude of functions and it really helped me in purchasing the set.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The other aspect I enjoyed was the realistic look of the vehicle. It is based off an actual tractor that is common in farms used in Europe. I was very&nbsp; impressed by the research that was done to perfect every nuance about the set, to ensure perfection throughout. The model feels very robust and can get the job done on any field.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The power of the medium-sized motor is the only thing I did not like about the model. I got this set about eight months ago and have noticed that over time, the reliability with the turning of the cab has lost its full-potential. It needs physical force to get it to move, which makes me question if the designers should have put a large motor in the model. I understand that it would have made the model faster than the real vehicle, but it would have helped in the longevity&nbsp;of the functions in the set. The crane works just fine in the back with the motor, but the cab function has seem to dissipate&nbsp;over this long time period. Besides that, this model exceeded every expectation I had for it.&nbsp;</li>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set:</strong></h2>

<p>I think this model is one of the greatest Technic model&#39;s that have been designed in the last ten years of the whole Lego universe. The detail implemented into every aspect of this model is exceptional and really makes any person want to purchase this work of art. It would have been better to split the model into more than two bags of building, but it does present an immaculate challenge for any builder, young or old. I would highly recommend this model to any enthusiast of Technic or Lego fans that are intrigued in the designing of these impressive machines. This is one of my top three favorite Lego models from any theme and am really excited for the future of Technic machines.&nbsp;</p>

"pkhepworth","2020-06-16T19:20:22.45Z","Claas Xerion 5000","<p>I&#39;ve just recently got back into Lego after about 30 years mainly due to my son being old enough to enjoy them himself. I bought this Claas Xerion for the both of us because we both&nbsp;love tractors and this set did not disappoint. It looks fantastic and has a lot of functions. I also love the modding capabilities in that you can easily build you own implements to attach to the tractor in place of the crane. The crane is cool, but the Xerion 5000 is the star of this set. As for price, I can&#39;t really say too much&nbsp;because I bought this new in 2020 and the set is from 2016, so needless to say, I paid more than $179.99.&nbsp;But with that said, it was still worth every penny.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not without its quirks though. The HoG steering is stiff and really works best on hard flooring while driving. The cab likes to move a bit when steering to the left, mainly because of the rotating function, but that&#39;s easy to fix.&nbsp;It is a complex steering system because it has three steering modes, which I&#39;d rather have with the quirks than without. But in the end, none of that really matters if you&#39;re a fan of tractors or sets with a lot of functions because this is a must own set at any price.</p>
