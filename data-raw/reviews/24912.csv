<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Large box, with the Fire Station shown off in full on the front. &nbsp;The back of the the box shows multiple iterations of the build (4 options), and each of the vehicles and the structure in various exciting fire fighting adventures.</p>

<p>Multiple instructions. &nbsp;One for each vehicle: Chief&#39;s&nbsp;car, the hook and ladder truck, the helicopter, and the structure itself. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One of my compliants about Lego since my youth, is the inclusion of larger parts where smaller stud pieces would have still sufficed. &nbsp;This set is chocked&nbsp;full of them. &nbsp;Garage door tracks, posts for the windows, etc. &nbsp;For and adult builder it takes away from the build to a degree. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I love the clear blue half cylinders that mae up the revolving door. &nbsp;Lots of large dark and light grey plates, and tools aplenty to go around for each of the minifigs. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Four firefighter minifigs. &nbsp;Two Firefighters, one Fire Chief (gold helmut), and one helicopter pilot. &nbsp;Then there&#39;s the always needed dalmatian.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the hot dog stand cart guy. &nbsp;Why else would you need three vehicles, but to put out a hot dog stand fire!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is nothing short of ordinary for the actual structure. &nbsp;This is where those large pieces I kind of despise come into play. &nbsp;Lots of tall panels to finish up a level quickly. &nbsp;There&#39;s a two sets of A Frames that connect the tower portion to each of the garages, which ultimately allows for some minor customization (the four alternative builds the box proclaims). &nbsp;Sadly, the only real options for these is flipping the garage&nbsp;orientation, and making the garages angle at a different way. &nbsp;I wish they had incorporated the Technic pieces used for this, on each side of both garages, thus creating many&nbsp;more optional builds. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished model is sharp. &nbsp;I will say that. &nbsp;The three levels each have their own function: 1) Entry/Reception, 2) Ops/Dispatch and 3) living quarters (the bunk beds are pretty cool). &nbsp;The boys love the pole, although I find it&#39;s exterior location odd. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hook and Ladder truck has been by far the most used. &nbsp;It captures the feel of a large fire truck, with it&#39;s nicely articulated boom, the stabilizing arms, and a ton of storage bins built in. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m partial to the helicopter, as it packs a ton of playability too. &nbsp;Swiveling spot light, and swiveling stud shooter. &nbsp;And there&#39;s a storage bind built in for those clear blue stud pieces. &nbsp;And the whole thing&nbsp;just looks cool. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The weak vehicle is the Chief&#39;s car. &nbsp;But it&#39;s still pretty slick. &nbsp;More like a sports car, then maybe a Sport Ute I&#39;d expect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also like the hot dog cart. &nbsp;Nice little build, and now the popcorn stand on Main Street has some competition!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My Legoland finally has&nbsp;fire protection. &nbsp;Only took 30 years! &nbsp;It&#39;s a sharp looking building, and the vehicles pack a punch of playability for fire fighting adventures. &nbsp;Still wish these buildings came with road plates.....</p>

<p>I like the optional builds, but just a tiny more fleshing out, would have given this set a ton more to the coolness factor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My boys and I have&nbsp;found the A Frame to connect the three &quot;sets&quot;&nbsp;a bit flimsy, and the Technic pins are not real forgiving, so taking apart and snapping the sections back and forth has been rather destructive.</p>

"kermitfrog11915_gmail_com","2018-08-02T01:54:52.01Z","I love this set!","<p>This set is the best fire station so far. The large fire truck is very durable and sleek. The small car is very good. The building is pretty durable for the most part. The Helicopter is very nice and good for playing. The mini figures are very nice and some&nbsp; are new ones. The pole is a very unique. In the Set #7208 the pole was very flimsy and weak. It was not good for playing. Overall, the set is awesome.&nbsp;</p>
