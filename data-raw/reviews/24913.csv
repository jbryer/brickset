"Skut","2016-02-15T22:57:13.32Z","Blaze busting behemoth!","<p>This is one of Lego&#39;s best fire trucks in years.&nbsp; Since the inception of City over 10 years ago, there has been a noticeable absence of articulated fire trucks.&nbsp; Indeed to find some really first rate &quot;big&quot; fire trucks you need to go back to set 6340 (Hook &amp; Ladder) from 1994 (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6340-1/Hook-Ladder"">http://brickset.com/sets/6340-1/Hook-Ladder)</a>, or even further to 6358 Snorkel Squad from 1987 (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6358-1/Snorkel-Squad"">http://brickset.com/sets/6358-1/Snorkel-Squad).</a>&nbsp; Happily, 60112 goes a long way to making up for these deficiencies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, to the build.&nbsp; This is an enjoyable process and it&#39;s good to see how well the structure in the trailer section (in particular) is put together.&nbsp; Younger builders should have few problems. possibly only needing assistance in tying the knot to secure the hose in its reel, as well as perhaps a few pointers on assembling the ladder elevation mechanism.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second, a word about the new &quot;water shooting&quot; hose system, which is not only&nbsp;used in this set but also in most of the other new Fire sets for 2016.&nbsp; Based on the box art and web photos, I was dubious.&nbsp; However I am now a believer - this system is <u>great</u> for play value.&nbsp; What the pictures don&#39;t show is that the &quot;flames&quot; on the building are mounted on inverted discs (<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-54196"">http://brickset.com/parts/design-54196).</a>&nbsp; This means the fire hose &quot;gun&quot; shoots a 1x1 trans blue plate (the &quot;water&quot;) and knocks the flames off the building, &quot;putting out&quot; the fire.&nbsp; Hard to describe in words but an absolute playability winner in practice.&nbsp; Hats off to Lego for this innovation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The overall&nbsp;looks of the model are great.&nbsp; It really evokes a large, city-based fire truck, particularly as seen in cities in the US.&nbsp; The cabin comfortably holds two firefighters and the stabilising feet for the trailer are well designed.&nbsp; There are plenty of clips for fire equipment and a big storage bay built into the trailer for the firefighters&#39;&nbsp;equipment box, which for some reason is completely empty.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a&nbsp;few&nbsp;drawbacks which I should mention.&nbsp; All involve the trailer (ladder) section.&nbsp; The first is the connection to the prime mover.&nbsp; This consists simply of an inverted hook on the trailer which sits in a round 2x2 tile with hole on the back of the prime mover.&nbsp; While it&#39;s not the first time Lego has used this system on an articulated truck, it&#39;s too flimsy for a fire truck where the ladder is moveable - any attempt to deploy the ladder causes the trailer to disconnect from the prime mover.&nbsp; A more secure connection was needed here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second is the ladder location - a tiller fire truck design such as this&nbsp;should locate&nbsp;the ladder at the front of the trailer pointing backwards, rather than at the rear pointing forwards (as in this model).&nbsp; The obvious reason is to allow the ladder to be positioned closer to the fire.&nbsp; Fortunately, this is a very easy MOC conversion to do, although you may need a 2x4 plate and a 4x4 plate to raise the turntable slightly to provide adequate clearance when mounting it at the front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final anomaly is the ladder itself. A truck design such as this should have an extending ladder, as in its real-world counterparts.&nbsp; (The above-mentioned 6340 was perhaps the apex of this idea, with no less than FOUR ladder pieces.)&nbsp; For no reason I can see, Lego has provided <u>no</u> extension capability to the ladder in this set.&nbsp; Indeed a grey&nbsp;&quot;basic&quot; ladder is used to connect the two white ladder pieces, and this design choice actually complicates any attempt to add your own MOC ladder extensions.&nbsp; I&#39;m sure this can be redesigned by all the MOCers out there, but Lego should have put more effort into achieving a&nbsp;functional extension ladder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifig selection in this set is solid, with three firefighters who include some new torso printing as well as the leg printing introduced in the 2013 Fire sets.&nbsp; There&#39;s no one to rescue, so you&#39;ll have to borrow some helpless ninja, jedi knight or super hero from another set to serve in this role.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &quot;on fire&quot; building is a functional (rather than beautiful) little addition and, as mentioned above, serves as good platform for placement of the &quot;target&quot; flames.&nbsp; It really adds to the set&#39;s play value.&nbsp; Perhaps it&#39;s a training facility because someone has been thoughtful enough to put a sign on the door (a sticker) warning that the place is on fire.&nbsp; Perhaps its a health &amp; safety measure for firefighters these days...</p>

<p>As this set is an exclusive, you may have to search around the shops a bit to get it.&nbsp; It seems that the more a set&#39;s shelf appeal, the more likely Lego is to limit its availability by making it exclusive.&nbsp; Go figure...</p>

<p>The final verdict: a very good set indeed, but be ready to do some tinkering with the trailer to get the most out of it.&nbsp;</p>

"Dude45","2016-09-18T08:56:33.91Z","A solid set, but don't try to cross a railway","<p>LEGO has a tradition of pouring out new fire department sets, obviously because they&#39;re in such high demand with kids. I find it a predictable pattern and not especially exciting. This set though is a little different from the ordinary, having a trailer with a long ladder.</p>

<p>The vehicle has an American style to it (get the smaller 60107 if you want a European design instead). It definitely has &quot;the look&quot; and feels solid. Three minifigures are included but only two fit inside the vehicle.</p>

<p>For playability, it is thoughtful of LEGO to include a small but tall building structure to be set on fire. The fires are supposed to be &quot;knocked out&quot; using the water stud shooter. I also appreciate that there are many holders and a storage space which make sure that tools can attach to the ride rather than get lost.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any cons with this set? Aside from the pricing (a bit too high when compared to similar sets) some dalmatians are sorely missed. And if you try to drive across a standard LEGO City rail way crossing, the trailer will detach and find itself hopelessly stuck on the rail, just waiting for impact. We must simply hope that no fires will start on the other side of the railway.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this fire engine may be a little hard to find; it is only sold at exclusively selected stores. This will probably make aftermarket prices higher than usual. So if you&#39;re interested get it while you can.</p>
