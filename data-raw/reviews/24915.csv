"Buku","2016-01-17T19:09:06.427Z","Great concept and playability","<p>Went to the LEGO store to pick up a DUPLO set for the youngest one&#39;s upcoming birthday and found&nbsp;2016&nbsp;sets had finally arrived in the UAE. After choosing the DUPLO&nbsp;(and Lakeside Lodge for me!) I checked in with the wife and my eldest daughter (3 and a half) to see what set we would be walking away with for that afternoon&#39;s father daughter build. My wife thought this set looked cool, I raised no objection, and&nbsp;so here we are.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box obviously caught the imagination of my wife who remarked that it looked like it had a lot of good play features.</p>

<p>The front shows the vehicles in action and&nbsp;the crime boss making his escape. The&nbsp;back shows several more of the escape routes/scenarios and the opening feature of the yard area.</p>

<p>6 instruction booklets are included with the steps at the usual leisurely CITY pace. 1st booklet covers the two boats, 2nd the two aircraft, and the balance the structure.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The new Massive/Mega(?)&nbsp;Ugly Rock Piece&nbsp;sure does&nbsp;take&nbsp;up a lot of space. I&#39;m not opposed to the inclusion of a limited&nbsp;number of MURP, LURP, BURPs&nbsp;so long as they keep the overall price down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts making up the balloon were included in one of the Friends&#39; sets last year in different colours. Although I&#39;m sure some will find an alternative use for them, they are quite purpose specific. The black ones already had scratches on them coming out of the packaging which was a disappointment.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen the windscreen on the police boat before. It looks great.</p>

<p>The two floatable&nbsp;boats included will get some bath time, a real bonus for those with young kids.</p>

<p>My daughter enjoys building big structures so lots of doors, windows and cell walls are a plus.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>8 in all. 4 baddies and 4 goodies with a female representative on each side.</p>

<p>The bad guy (or possibly wrongly accused, I shouldn&#39;t be so judgmental) torso&nbsp;with the jump suit top rolled down looks fantastic and his mustache&nbsp;suits the look. I like the crime boss character from the animated min-movies and he is represented well here.</p>

<p>The cops are vanilla as always but that&#39;s not a bad thing per se.</p>

<p>They also throw in a shark which adds a little spice to any escapes using the dingy.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>That it is not a challenging build, even by CITY standards, meant that my daughter could do almost all of it; the observation tower windows gave her&nbsp;trouble as did &nbsp;putting&nbsp;a few of the smallest pieces on the rocks. I was mostly relegated to brick picking duties to speed along the process a little.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helicopter blades are held together by a TECHNIC&nbsp;piece providing 2 studs contact on both sides&nbsp;which increases the structural stability enormously over the standard 1 stud. The other CITY helicopters have all required me to do a similar mod myself, about time this was done by LEGO to start with.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s deceptively tall and covers a larger effective area than the previous main police station (60047). The different contrasts between the rocks, bricks and bars with flashes of&nbsp;police blue and a sprinkling of green&nbsp;looks really good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The police boat is the nicest&nbsp;looking boat based on this hull that I have seen in a long time, possibly ever.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a big fan of the jetty and wooden exterior stairs. Especially pleasing that they didn&#39;t put the helipad on top of the right hand tower.</p>

<p>I was disappointed that there is a huge void behind the MURP that is simply wasted. I think that they should&#39;ve found a way to build another escape route through there or otherwise utilise the space.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Cops and Robbers never&nbsp;gets old!</p>

<p>Escape scenarios that we have played through with either the crowbar or grappling hook often providing assistance:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Easy hot air balloon access!</li>
	<li>Hatch on walkway</li>
	<li>Loose bars assembly at front of&nbsp;exercise yard</li>
	<li>Hatch on top of right hand tower</li>
	<li>Loose bars assembly at front of right hand cell</li>
	<li>Hatch in right hand cell&nbsp;leading to drainage pipe with removable grate</li>
	<li>Flick switch controlling cell/security doors (switch controlling lights also adds play value to a number of scenarios)</li>
	<li>Crack the code to the security door and walk out</li>
	<li>During prisoner transport&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The ability to swing open the front of the exercise yard helps access and was a solid inclusion by the set designer.</p>

<p>The interplay&nbsp;possibilities between the helicopter, the balloon and the two&nbsp;boats&nbsp;works nicely. I can&#39;t remember the bad guys having air support before.</p>

<p>More playability than the last main Police Station as a standalone set but integrating this into the wider city will be more of a challenge.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I wasn&#39;t sure that we&#39;d get this set when I first saw the pictures but am glad that we did. It looks better on the box than the internet and then better in person again. Will be a hit with the kids due to the amount of play options.</p>

"crasg","2016-12-26T01:46:09.303Z","great set!","<p>i got this set for Christmas&nbsp;2016. i liked the parts but i think it had a bit too many big parts in it.</p>

<p>i liked the rocky finish and how playable it is. i think that kids aged 6-10 would like this set quite a bit. i do think the price of 170$ is a bit much for the set.this is my first review. see you next time on my review of 60123 VOLCANO SUPPLY HELICOPTER!</p>
