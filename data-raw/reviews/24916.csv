<p>Crooks Island is a great set. The value for money and playability is very high. The concept of housing and a police helicopter in a small set is very ingenious. I definitely recommend it.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>There are 3 instruction booklets, all of which are easy to follow. They are in chronological order from the least difficult to build to most difficult . The 1st booklet builds the two crooks and the shipping container, the 2nd builds the hut/rocks and the 3rd builds the helicopter.</p>

<p><strong>Interesting/exclusive parts</strong>:</p>

<p>There are 245 parts in this set, 13 of which are interesting or exclusive. They are:4x2 inverted slope roof tile in black (only available in 13 other sets), 3x3 plate cross in black (only available in 6 other sets),plate 1x1 with tooth bright blue (only available in 3 other sets),Plate 2X4X1 1/3 W. Side Bow in red (only available in 1 other set),Round Brick 1X1 Dark Azur (only available in 7 other sets),Welder\U0027S Torch W. 3,2 Shaft Dark Stone Grey (only available in 5 other sets),Brick 1X2 W.

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>There are 3 minifigures in this set: A male escaped crook , a female crook and a police helicopter pilot.</p>

<p>The male crook uses the 2016 Prison Island inmate torso and one of the common face prints. His face is an unshaven face with an annoyed expression. His torso print shows the classic black and white stripes (although they look more like dark grey and cream) prison uniform, which is open and reveals the orange prison jumpsuit and the crook&#39;s large physical build underneath. He has a dark grey beanie.</p>

<p>The female crook reuses the 2014 criminal torso and the 2015 female crook face print. Her face print is basically a regular City female face, but the over exaggerated,angry eyebrows make her look more evil, or at least mischievous. Her torso print is the striped prison shirt covered by a black jacket. She has short brown hair.</p>

<p>The police helicopter pilot reuses the now common 2012 police pilot torso print. His face print is the common print for all aviators. His torso print is dark blue with various pockets and has a police badge.One of his legs has a map printed onto it.</p>

<p>The minifigures are good. They are not great, but they are alright.</p>

<p>The male crook is the common crook minifigure of the two inmates from this year. Although he is no where near exclusive, I do really like his printing.</p>

<p>The female crook is probably the best minifigure in this set. A female crook, a&nbsp; mean female and a female with short hair are all fairly new ideas, which I hope they will continue to offer even more diversity in Lego City. Her torso print is getting a bit old now, but do really like it, it is good to have crooks that do not look like they have just escaped from jail.</p>

<p>The pilot minifigure is alright but his torso, leg and face prints are all very dated now. I hope 2017 will bring a new police pilot uniform.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is quick, easy and enjoyable. I say the build is quick, easy and enjoyable a lot, but this is a good sign that Lego is keeping a regular difficultly for it&#39;s City sets. Although the helicopter is small , it&#39;s build is quite substantial.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>When built, you are left with a jetski, a hut/rocks and a police helicopter.</p>

<p>The jetski is very basic and can only hold 1 minifigure. It has a red and black colour scheme. There are 3 stickers, all of which are completely unnecessary and do not add any extra detail to the model. There is a handle bar which can be held by a minifigure and turned from side to side.</p>

<p>The helicopter can fit 1 minifigure in the cockpit. It uses the heavily criticized specialized helicopter windscreen piece. Although not the best in other sets, I think this type of helicopter design is perfect for a set like this; as I said in another review, these types of helicopters have their place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a joystick for control and no seat, although the bricks behind offer some back support. A very clever use of a front wheel arch piece makes the aircraft more aerodynamic, closes the gap between the front of the windshield and the rest of the helicopter, and continues the black line that runs through the model.</p>

<p>There is a camera behind the cockpit on one side, and a light and clip to hold handcuffs on the other. I am very pleased that there is somewhere to put the included handcuffs, a feature that is commonly left out in City police sets.</p>

<p>Some stacked wedge pieces bring the fuselage back until it is only 2 studs wide. Then, with the help of some jumper plates and other ingenious uses of parts, the tail boom is brought to 1 stud wide. The tail rotor is the right size and fits to the tail and tail boom perfectly. Finally, two specialized engine pieces give engine detail and the size appropriate main rotors look and work great. (They are easy to spin and do not come apart during play)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hut/rocks is the main build of the set. It is basically a shipping container, a shack and some rocks.</p>

<p>The shipping container uses the very useful and interesting 2016 corrugated panel pieces as the walls. Inside, there are some smooth tiles where the jetski parks. At the back are some odd-looking technic beams which form apart of the ain play feature. When the jetski is in the container, you hit the beams fairly hard and the jetski goes flying out. The only problem is that the minifigure has to be sitting down. This feature works well and is great for when the crooks want to &#39;show a pair of clean heels&#39; (make a quick getaway).</p>

<p>The hut is the best part of this set. There is a small wharf at the front, with a red lamp and a wooden door with &#39;Keep Out!&#39; on it. There is a window with glass on one side and the walls are built out of the popular textured &#39;bricks&#39; pattern. Unfortunately, the door does not have a handle. The roof has a vent and a chimney.</p>

<p>Inside the hut is the reason I mentioned housing. There is a sticker showing a furnace/fireplace and the Wanted poster on one side, and a coffee machine, clock and torch on the other. Although it is being used by criminals, this hut could easily be used as a home for a law-abiding citizen. The red lamp, blue coffee machine and green table all suggest that this does not have to be a crooks hideout, as well as the fact that, unlike previous hideouts, it is not derelict or empty.</p>

<p>The rocks are made up of a LURP. This means large ugly rock piece. (the most common name and size of these rock pieces is BURPs). The backs of these pieces are always left open, for this reason I prefer to refer to BURPs/LURPs as Large/Big Useful Rock Pieces. They make building stone walls and mountains easy and keep the parts count (and thus price) down. In this set, the box art actually shows the crooks hiding in the &#39;cave&#39; that is created. This is also where the included safe can be hidden.</p>

<p>The safe is a light grey mailbox piece with a sticker showing a keypad. This set includes a welding torch to break open the safe.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Crooks Island is a great set. The idea of getting a helicopter for a cheap price, plus detailed housing for minifigures is excellent. There is heaps of playability to be had; the getaway feature alone offers lots of fun. Even a simple game of who can make the jetski go the furthest would be enjoyable for children. Any Lego set that includes an aircraft always boosts the play value, this one is sturdy enough for play and,unlike its similar cousins, looks great. Although there is no place to hold the crooks once they have been arrested, children will easily find a way around this small flaw. Finally, the hut is a very good opportunity for role play and will not look out of place next to regular, legal homes. There are lots of new and interesting parts for AFOLs and the minifigures are good.</p>

<p>Crooks Island ticks all the boxes for a great Lego set. For $30/40 it is definitely value for money and will complement other police and City sets, without depending on the other sets to make it substantial. The designers have done an excellent job, I have no regrets whatsoever for buying this set, and I believe you won&#39;t either.</p>
