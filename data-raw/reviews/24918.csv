Also i love the fact that you can add the Merlok&#39;s Library 2.0 to the Fortrex to make a full blown castle!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is your standard large box for sets over &pound;70 and the instructions are just one book which i love because it has a proper spine and everything!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>it has a lot of parts that i like like the new scurrier body pieces, Ash Attacker&#39;s head, the new turret piece and i love that fact that Lego has introduced the new rubber technic pieces to go in the track.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>the figures are really cool and i&#39;ve been really been looking forward to see how they built Axl because he is a different shape of figure. I do think they could have had a few more mini-fig&#39;s though.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It was a really fulfilling build although it did take me about 2 hours to build. although (i&#39;m gonna have to moan again but) i did think that the little plane you get looks quite unfinished but it&#39;s ok.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks awesome! i do like set set ups and with the rest of the sets it looks awesome!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>i love this set. even though it looks unfinished in some places the good things make me overlook them. if your thinking about buying it then i would really recommend it!</p>
