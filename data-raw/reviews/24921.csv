<p>I decided to get this set as it&#39;s a cheap way to get Zane and Kai in their Lego ninjago&nbsp;movie robes although the builds were surprisingly quite good!</p>

<h2><strong>The builds&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The main build of this set is a simple corner of a&nbsp;dojo. The corner of the dojo is decorated with a red light ,represented by a translucent minifigure head,&nbsp;hanging from the roof . The wall of the dojo is decorated with a 2x3 printed tile which reads &#39;DOJO WU in ninjago&nbsp;movie language. Finally the build is finished off with two weapons attached to the side of the building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another build part of the set is a sword holder which is a simple build using a rare sword holder&nbsp;piece similar to the one used by the ninja in tournament of elements but instead of a neck brackett it has a small bar which is fitted in to the rest of the build by a light grey/bluish pin.</p>

<p>This small set also contains a training dummy which spins on an axle piece . The dummy is decorated with a black helmet which fans of the ninjago&nbsp;masters of spinjitzu tv&nbsp;show will identify as the helmet of shadows, the helmet worn by Garmadon in the second season which made him able to control the indestructible stone army.</p>

<p>The final build of the set is a wooden training excersize which has wooden poles and is an excersize&nbsp;that trains the ninjas speed. This doesn&#39;t spin unlike previous ninjago&nbsp;sets making it the weakest part of the set</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>The minifigures in this set are Kai and Zane who wear&nbsp;their ninjago&nbsp;movie robes.Both of the minifigures in this set include their new two piece helmet unlike some of the other lego Ninjago movie sets. Zane has a happy expression and and angry expression&nbsp;which are similar to Kai&#39;s double sided head print. Kai&#39;s suit is red and black and writing down the lining of it says fire in&nbsp;ninjago&nbsp;movie language while on zane&#39;s&nbsp;white and black&nbsp;suit it says ice. Kai is equipped with two silver katanas but Zane is equipped with a bow and arrow, his new weapons for the movie.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Overall this set is great for the price of &pound;8.99 ,$9.99 or 9,99&euro; so would recommend for any fan of ninjago&nbsp;movie or show.</p>

<p>The box is small, and shows Kai and Zane training in the &quot;dojo Wu&quot;. The back shows a large photo of the set, and some inset pictures show the &nbsp;play features of the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Zane has a white gi&nbsp;with angular black printing on his torso and legs. Both ninja wear a very well designed headwrap&nbsp;that comes in two pieces.Zane&#39;s is all white, while Kai has a black wrap with red headband. Zane is armed with a rare black bow element.</p>

<p>Kai has a red gi reminiscent of the original Red Ninja from the &#39;90s on his torso, and black legs with dark red armor printing. His armor is brand new in the pearl dark grey color, and he comes armed with two pearl silver Katana.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>The main model in the set is a corner of the Dojo Wu on board the Destiny&#39;s Bounty, and it is small but detailed, with a large scroll that has a new printed 2x3 tile that says &quot;Dojo Wu&quot; in Ninjago language, and weapons clipped to the sides.The training equipment consists of a simple sword rack and a dummy wearing the Helmet of Shadows.Also included is a wooden pole with prongs sticking out of the sides.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Great figs</p>

<p>nice Dojo build</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>Zane has a single-color mask</p>

<p>the weapons on the side of the Dojo are a bit random</p>

<p>wooden post doesn&#39;t spin</p>

<p>Overall rating: 5/5</p>

"jdm","2017-08-25T21:28:23.797Z","Great Dojo for a youngster","<p>My 4 year old picked this off the shelf today to buy with his birthday money. &nbsp;We went through the build together and got about 2/3rds of the&nbsp;way through before he asked me to finish it. &nbsp;He was off with the minifigs!!</p>

<p>The build is not complicated and I don&#39;t think that there are any rare&nbsp;parts but it is a great little set to build with a youngster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My son chose it for the&nbsp;minifigs, and getting 2 of the heroes plus the dojo is great value when you compare it to a single figure in the CMF series. &nbsp;</p>

<p>he&#39;s still playing now and it is well after his bedtime.....</p>

<p>thoroughly recommended budget set.&nbsp;</p>

"Trigger_","2017-09-30T05:46:25.06Z","Awesome Set For Young LEGO Fans","<p>First of all, I gotta say this set was not really a scene in the film, but some of these elements WERE in it. Ever since the Ninja-Go&nbsp;theme had its commencement&nbsp;in 2011 and a key part of its early prosperity was the esse of the unique form of martial arts, edified by smart old Sensei Wu. This easy substratum, besides the brilliant dragons, was what drew traditional Ninja theme fans to relish Ninja-Go beyond the initial goofy skeletal foes and future cars. This set is ergo a return to compose and echoes kindred designs in the debut year, such as 2504 and proximately&nbsp;2516 Ninja Training Outpost.</p>

<p>It is unorthodox to visually perceive more than one ninja in a set of this size, and the LEGO Ninja-Go Movie versions of Kai and Zane should be an humongous giant draw to fans for the low price of $9.99. What could go erroneous?</p>

<h2>Mini Figures</h2>

<p>Kai was the main hero of Ninja-Go at its beginning afore Lloyd was introduced in Year 2. However, he still has remained the most&nbsp;popular character since then, with an astronomically colossal role to play sometimes. He had little role and personality in the film, but he is a good fig. Kai, like the other ninja, is given a paramount change to his appearance within the LEGO Movie macrocosm. His legs are ebony, which is a striking contrast compared to the torso - nonetheless, the crimson perpetuates with diamond shapes on his legs. The torso is a scarlet housecoat thingy, recalling the ninjas&#39; pristine which were quite basic in design. The gi is lined with Asian letters.</p>

<p>Kai is different from the rest of the ninjas, due to having a mold consisting of a shoulder pad and blade holder. This piece originated in the pirate line, but is incipient in gunmetal, or a platinum metal color. The back printing of the torso is covered by the piece, but abstracting it reveals a golden and black symbol which recalls the symbol on the back of sundry Master Wu mini-figs last year.</p>

<p>Kai&#39;s face moves the cicatrix to his right ocular perceiver and integrates a Band Aid to the left side of his forehead. He is consummate with a grinning expression on one side, and an exasperated head on the other. The masks in the film&#39;s sets are unique as they are&nbsp;composed of two incipient pieces - one for the bandana&nbsp;that covers his mouth (homogeneous to the piece that came in the Ninja Droids line), and the other a helmet with a colorful headband and symbol. These pieces are slotted in between the torso and face, and on top of the face&#39;s stud, respectively.</p>

<p>Zane is both homogeneous and different from his hotheaded comrade. The stoic Icy Ninja&nbsp;is given a white jacket with ebony details, which looks marvelous. The torso design is rather angular in appearance, suiting the mechanical nature of this adventurer. Additionally present are silver communication contrivances. The leg printing is destitute compared to Kai&#39;s, but suffices. Like Kai, he has a two piece mask with what&nbsp;a felicitous snowflake symbol on the forehead.</p>

<p>Unlike Kai, Zane is equipped with a quiver on his back and a longbow brandished in hand. Abstracting the quiver reveals the ninja&#39;s back printing: a symbol like Kai&#39;s. Determinately, one head print is goofy and toothy, with the flip side being virtually the exact antithesis extreme: exasperation!</p>

<h2>Builds</h2>

<p>There are a few little pieces that accompany the main model. One of these is a little blade rack. The piece to keep the samurai swords, which has appeared in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles sets, is connected by pin to a tan 2x2 brick with Technic aperture. It is an easy, but efficacious, model. Next comes a wood training area... which cannot be spun. This is the only bad part of the set for me as the play value is enervated by a thing that does not do what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>On the other hand, this pedestal, with a plain black mini fig face and the&nbsp;Helmet of Shadows on top, is brilliant. The base is constructed so that it can facilely be tilted and hit around, like a dummy. The Helmet of Shadows itself is a wondrous inclusion, as well, as it only appeared as in Series Two of the Ninja-Go TV show. Its only other appearance in a set&nbsp;was Temple of Light - that variant of the helmet withal had a mouth sentinel akin to Samurai X, which this set&#39;s helmet dolefully lacks. This is good, though, as it makes it precise to the exhibition.</p>

<p>Determinately, we have the most sizable part of the set, which is a section of two walls that meet in the corner of the dojo. The detail for such a minuscule model is remarkable - and central to it all is a printed 2x3 white scroll.&nbsp;Wu&#39;s symbol, which appears on all of the ninjas&#39; backs, is on the scroll as well. I venerate the cumulation of tan and brown dispersed on the circumventing walls and paneling, with highlights of ebony, including the crown of the roof.</p>

<p>The area is illuminated by a single transparent crimson face to&nbsp;be a&nbsp;lantern. While the clips on either side are designed to hold fist and claw weaponry, I exhibit other types of arms, and you can even expand the walls with your own dojo builds - in the same manner as the LEGO Batman Movie Gotham Energy cumulation models!</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Awesome set, not one of the best Ninja-Go Movie sets (but that is because all except the Movie Maker ones so far are OUTSTANDING), but this one is still awesome. One of few perfect $9.99 sets, is all I can say. Do not mind the woody training area not spinning, that is where you come in and spin it with your hands or imagination.</p>

"masterbuilderninja","2017-09-02T01:43:36.047Z","Great set with two minifigures!","<p>This is a great set with two minifigs&nbsp;for a good price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs: This set includes two characters, Kai and Zane. Kai is wearing a&nbsp;detailed ninja robe, which is red with black highlights. He also has a dark silver sword holder and two silver swords.&nbsp;Kai&#39;s mask is black with a red band and a&nbsp;tiny gold symbol. His head is double-sided and has a determined scowl and a sort of sheepish grin.&nbsp;Zane sports a neat ninja outfit with a belt that has some equipment on it. His weapon is a black bow and arrow, as well as a holster of arrows. Zane&#39;s mask is all white, with a snowflake-like symbol. A huge smile covers one side of his head, while the other side has an angry frown.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Main build: The main build is a small corner of a dojo, with a red lantern and scroll. The scroll is a printed on two by three tile with some writing and the symbol seen on Wu and his ninja. There are two weapons on either side of the dojo. Both are built with a brown stick and a clip with a hole in the bottom. A different handheld minifigure&nbsp;accessory completes each. This build was&nbsp;&nbsp;expertly created, and involves an interesting building technique.</p>

<p>Side builds: This set includes three side builds. The first is a sword rack built out of eight pieces, counting the two swords. Next is a spinning training post. This is the only downside of the set, because the spinning post doesn&#39;t spin. However, it would be hard to build it so that&nbsp;it would spin at this price. The last model is a training dummy depicting Garmadon. This is probably my favorite part of the set, because it actually tips like the real thing!</p>

<p>Overall: This is a awesome&nbsp;set because it comes with two detailed&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;and great models. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"adutt17","2018-01-02T04:14:47.723Z","Spinjitzu Training Review","<p>I like this set a lot, right off the bat. The inclusion of two minifigures&nbsp;for a $15 set is incredible. The playability is a little bit lacking, but it makes up for that with the inclusion of 4 main structure builds, which were all really fun to build. I think the price for the set is really good, the minifigures included are really good, and it&#39;s always good to have an extra of each. I think the weapons are all really good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Two minifigures in a $15 set is really good.</p>

"Max_Bricks","2018-03-28T21:19:00.4Z","A Great $10 Set ","<p>I got this Ninjago Movie set back in Christmas of 2017 and I was thrilled to get because&nbsp;I got vibes from the training course from season 1 of the Ninjago TV series back in 2012.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>The set comes with 2 great mini-figures, Kai and Zane&nbsp;in their updated look from the Ninjago Movie. In the first wave of these Kai appears in this suit in 2 other sets, not including the juniors set, Destiny&#39;s Bounty, which is pretty expensive, but worth the money, and the Water Strider. I know your thinking that he&#39;s in the Fire Mech but that one doesn&#39;t have an arm pad. I like Kai&#39;s arm pad in dark gray and his new face is prefect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zane on the other hand appears in 3 other sets, the Fire Mech, Destiny&#39;s Bounty and the Ice Tank. This Zane mini-figure will be reused in the 2nd wave of the Ninjago Movie sets in Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;Volcano Lair. Zane&nbsp;has a nice bow and quiver in black and I also love the new updated mask look for both of the ninjas, plus his new face print.&nbsp;Like I said earlier&nbsp;this reminds me of the TV&nbsp;show training area that I&#39;ve always dreamed of having a set of. You get a sword holder, a punching bag with a nice samurai helmet on it that bobble around. You get some spinning training combat thing. Also you go an are to keep your mini- figures with a nice print and a cool use of the mini-figure head as a lamp translucent red.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>I kinda wish that the spinning training combat thing actually spun because it would really give the playing experience that you see in the show or movie perhaps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall out of all the Ninjago sets I&#39;ve seen in a while I think this is worth your money with the play features and the mini-figures. Kai and Zane, that are found in relatively expensive builds. I almost would give it 5 stars, but I&nbsp;was disappointed&nbsp;about how the spinning training combat thing didn&#39;t spin. I would still recommend this set despite that minor error.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-05-10T19:36:57.503Z","Great little set","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This is a great little set, that pleasantly surprised me. I picked it up to complete my Ninjago Movie sets collection. IMHO it offers quite a bit value for money. Two minifigs (Kai and Zane), multiple weapons, training equipment. This little set IMHO shows how effective the designers were: they did a lot with relatively few pieces. IMHO a little gem of a set.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>This is a quick build, 10 to 15 minutes maximum. There are no stickers, the dojo sign is a print. The sword rack and training dummies are nice little side builds. The dojo-corner is great, and the way the designer has constructed it is very nice to see.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Kai and Zane are included (with their weapons). They are far from unique (Kai is found in 4 sets, Zane in 5) but still nice minifigs.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The accessories are nice, the dojo-corner excellent. Even as a small stand alone, but also as an inspiration for a larger MOC.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This is clearly a play set. That said, the accessories could easily be incorporated in a much larger (dojo) MOC.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>I think this is a nice little set that offers a lot of value for money: two Ninja minifigs, plenty of weapons, nice accessories and a superb little corner build. Even though the PPP is quite high (for Ninjago&nbsp;Movie sets), I still think this is a great little set to get.</p>
