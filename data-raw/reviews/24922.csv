<p>lastly it has the best characters you could ask for 2 ninja a villain and ham all great printed so that does it for my thoughts on the Ninjago city chase set</p>

The sets on the other hand were very well thought out and very desireable, I&rsquo;ve found myself wanting a lot, but only able to afford a few and so I chose this set as my first because of the price and the Minifigure selection in this particular set.</span></span></span></span></p>

Much like LEGO Movie characters, Ham suffers from having a permanent expression of terror on his face under his rice-hat&hellip; er&hellip; ahem, or whatever that hat thing is actually called. I really should just google it, anyway, his accessory is a printed 100 dollar bill.</span></span></span></span></p>

One of them has a wider smile while the other looks more sheepish, embarrassed, nervous? I have no idea what they were going for, but it&rsquo;s not much of a change, he&rsquo;s got a smaller mouth and a slight upturn of the eyebrows.</span></span></span></span></p>

She&rsquo;s dressed in her civilian clothes, which feature torn jeans, a dark black jacket and an under-shirt with black and white stripes. Now you might think this means Nya is a LEGO City criminal, but it&rsquo;s not that kind of stripes, they&rsquo;re more evenly spaced and numerous meaning it&rsquo;s a shirt design and not a crook&rsquo;s outfit.</span></span></span></span></p>

He includes handcuffs and no printing on the legs, rather plain, but a fun addition to the police forces of Bad Cop if you wanted to army build.</span></span></span></span></p>

He features a lot of detailing in the torso and legs for armor of some sort, probably not very effective armor, and he&rsquo;s got a dull orange beanie hat and an eyepatch on his scruffy bearded facial print. This guy is very Air Piratey.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a pretty decent and quick build, though I do caution that the four flagpoles may require an adult to help settle into the model as they fit quite tightly into the clips. Minor sticker use on this model.</span></span></span></span></p>

Sticker placement makes the majority of the detailing and the majority of the potential tricky spots to get them all fitting on their tiles. You&rsquo;ll also get the remaining two Minifigures in this bag. I love the stylized street sign build, it&rsquo;s very fun looking and fun to build.</span></span></span></span></p>

The street signs stand nicely together and feature a lot of stickered detailing, the food stall has fish, cherries and apples for sale and is low to the ground, the lights use some really clever elements to make them resemble paper lanterns.</span></span></span></span></p>

It is such an interesting looking vehicle, the colour combination of blacks and whites match up with the LEGO Movie Bad Cop&rsquo;s vehicle so nicely I&rsquo;d suggest blending the two themes together for some fun display options. (Provided you managed to pick up the older set with Bad Cop&rsquo;s car without the hovering mode build, but the actual wheeled model, which I, sadly, missed out on.)</span></span></span></span></p>

I am not a fan of Han having only one facial expression, he needed two heads at least so he&rsquo;s not perpetually terrified all the time.</span></span></span></span></p>

While the mechs do offer the Ninja in their fighting gear, I&rsquo;m more interested in picking up as few sets as possible as I don&rsquo;t have as much space as I&rsquo;d care for and there&rsquo;s a lot of stuff coming out which interests me. So I fully recommend this set as one of the must haves of the initial wave.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Studded_Dud","2020-07-26T22:21:40.85Z","That Guy Is So Outnumbered.","<p>Building Experience: The building experience for this set is actually quite interesting. Most of the time the actual building experience isn&#39;t all the fun but in this set it is! The cop car is very interesting because where I come from cop cars don&#39;t look anything like that. It features three wheels and two spots for minifigures to sit, one for the cop, and one for the crook. The market stand looks great and is really eye catching. It looks even better when the lights are hung over it along with the other signs.</p>

<p>Parts: The set includes 233 pieces&nbsp;and puts them all to use!&nbsp;It includes a variety of foods such as cherries, apples, and fish. Unfortunately most of the pieces are stickers, but Nya&#39;s phone and Lloyd&#39;s soda cap are printed. There are two trans-red heads that act as lights, there is also a hammer in the fish guy&#39;s hammer weapon.</p>

<p>Playability: The playability for this set is one of a kind. With 5 minifigs and three different sections of the set, the possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Value For Money: The set originally cost&nbsp;&pound;14.99 / $19.99, and for 233 pieces and 5 minifigs it has great value. It is reasonable that a set this size would include stickers, but it is nice that there are some printed elements included.</p>

<p>Minifigs: As mentioned there are 5 minifigs in this set. The first one is Lloyd. Lloyd&#39;s hair is a nice piece and works great on other custom minifigs. His Jacket and pants have a nice design that can be used on anyone. He includes a double-sided head that shows him both happy and relaxed.&nbsp;Nya is the next minifig. She has black hair and a double-sided face that features her happy on one side, and determined on the other. Her torso has a striped shirt under a black jacket, and her pants are ripped. Ham is the market man. Ham&#39;s hat is nice, and his head only shows him screaming. His torso is nice and continues the feel of the scene. Officer Toque is the cop. He has a cop helmet and a one sided face that shows him determined to catch the bad guy&#39;s. His police uniform has great detail and looks great alongside his dark blue pants. The Shark Army Thug picked a very bad day to be robbing the market. He is way outnumbered 4:1 and has no hope. His hat is a nice orangish color and he has a one-sided face featuring him grumpy. He also has an eye patch. His uniform looks perfect for his job, and he has printed legs featuring knee pads.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall the set looks magnificent and so do the minifigures, the price is great for the amount of pieces, and playability is definitely not a problem. The Shark Thug picked the wrong day to try and mess with the ninja and cops!</p>

"DutchFlyer","2017-12-23T16:29:28.353Z","Nice little play set","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This set is above all a play set. IMHO it offers quite a bit of play value, and provides great bang for buck. The police tuk-tuk is a nice little piece, and so are some of the minifigures.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>I took my time building this set, but it could be built in 20 - 30 minutes easily. As is the norm for the Ninjago&nbsp;Movie sets, there are many stickers to be applied: 4 on the tuk-tuk, 4 for the signs on the lamp-posts, and another 3&nbsp;for the stall. The build itself is easy and nice, nothing special, IMHO.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>This set includes 5 minifigures&nbsp;- Ham, Lloyd, Nya, Toque and a Shark Army thug - of which IMHO Nya, wearing a leather jacket and torn jeans, is the stand out minifig. Nya, Ham and Officer Toque are unique minifigs, while Lloyd - wearing a hoodie, hood-down can be found in two sets:&nbsp;this one and Ninjago&nbsp;City, a 350 euro set (by far the most expensive in the Ninjago&nbsp;Movie line). I would argue this&nbsp;set is&nbsp;worth its&nbsp;price for the minifigures alone, and the tuk-tuk&nbsp;and stall front are an added bonus.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The three builds are quite small. The tuk-tuk is stable, and offers ample play opportunities. The market stall (or store front) shows an interesting use of pieces, and the building technique for the red overhang is shared with one of the roofs in the&nbsp;Ninjago&nbsp;City set. I like the apples that are included. The lamp posts are rather delicate, but nice. The do topple easily though.</p>

<h2>Display vs play</h2>

<p>This set is clearly a play set. That said, the stall front as well as the lamp posts could be a nice addition to a display, or conversely, build a display around. The stall front is in more of a traditional style, and would fit well in Ninjago Old City.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>This set offers a lot of value for money as a play set, the build is quick but fun. And, as said before, the minifigures alone would make the set worth the price for collectors.&nbsp;The only negative&nbsp;(for some) is the amount of stickers that have to be applied. Highly recommended.</p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-06-10T12:04:52.897Z","Awesome set! ","<p>This set is a collection of small builds that can be positioned in various ways to create a great display. While the set doesn&rsquo;t include any action features, it still has good playability. The inclusion of five minifigures in a small set gives it great value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Lloyd Garmadon: This set includes Lloyd and Nya in their casual clothes. Lloyd has his characteristic untidy blonde hair piece invented for the Lego Ninjago Movie which looks fantastic. He has a different expression from standard Lego Ninjago Movie sets; one side is a smile and the other is quizzical. I appreciate getting different expressions and they both look good. The torso print is plain but appropriate and has a metallic silver zipper. His leg print shows a belt and pockets. He comes with a $100 note.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nya: Nya also has a Lego Ninjago Movie exclusive hair piece. It&rsquo;s black and gathered at the back with a silver band. Her focused expression appears to be the same as in other sets, but her open-mouthed smile is exclusive. Her torso looks fantastic with a black and white striped shirt and leather jacket. Her legs are equally well detailed showing ripped jeans with pockets, shoes, and a belt. She carries a mobile phone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Officer Toque: I really like this figure&#39;s helmet piece, it&#39;s black and white and has a great mould. He has a severe face with a moustache. The torso is well detailed and has a badge, belt and mic. Unfortunately, he doesn&rsquo;t have a leg print which is a big disappointment. For accessories he carries handcuffs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shark army thug: The generic thug included in this set is well detailed but not particularly interesting.</p>

<p>Ham: I particularly like the traditional clothes design of some citizens of Ninjago city. He wears the hat piece invented for the Ninjago Movie with a similar design to Wu&rsquo;s but with a wider brim. He has a terrified expression which looks great. His torso print is basic with mud splatterings on it. The robes continue to his printed legs but only on the front. The sides and back are left bare. This could be fixed with dual moulded legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Set</strong></h3>

<p>The set consists of three small builds: a lamp post, a police tuc-tuc, and a small shop.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Street Lamps</strong></p>

<p>I absolutely love the design of these lamps. Each post features different coloured signs with Ninjago script on them. The posts are connected with a string of lights which use a combination of transparent red studs and minifigure heads as lanterns. The overall effect looks awesome. As the posts are only loosely connected with the string of lights, you can position them closer together or further apart which changes the look of the display.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Police Tuc-Tuc &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This small three wheeled vehicle can fit a driver, and a passenger in the back. The type of wheels allow it to roll smoothly. A small clip holds an extra pair of handcuffs. The roof comes off easily to give you access to the figures. Although this is my least favourite part of the set it still looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Food Vender&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Although this build is only four studs deep it looks awesome. Nicely angled display cases on either side hold fish and cherries. There is a sign with a sticker over each basket that shows a picture of the display. Another sign over the red awning has more Ninjago letters on it. There is just enough space behind the counter for a single minifigure to stand and little lights illuminate the counter. A barrel of apples is also included.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love this set. All three of the builds are fantastic and make clever use of few parts. The five minifigures are also great. $30 aud is incredible value and I definitely recommend this set.&nbsp;<br />
