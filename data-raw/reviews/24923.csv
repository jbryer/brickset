"InvisibleTimmy","2017-08-15T14:15:52.293Z","“A true ninja would’ve counted all seven butterflies”","<p>When I first saw this set in June, It immediately caught my eye. On our recent visit to the LEGO store at Disney Springs, I picked up this, as well as Spinjitzu Training and the Classic Garmadon CMF. While not my most anticipated set of the range ( that honor belongs&nbsp;to the beautiful Destiny&#39;s Bounty), it&#39;s a close second. A very close second. Read on to find out why.h&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p><strong>Kai </strong>is the same as in Temple of the Ultimate ULTIMATE&nbsp;Weapon. He wears his standard TLNM&nbsp;gi with no hood, instead using an amazing new flame-like element. Kai is armed with pearl silver&nbsp;<em>katana&nbsp;</em>that slot into a Pearl Dark Gray&nbsp;scabbard.</p>

<p>The <strong>skeleton</strong> is the least interesting figure.It&#39;s a LEGO skeleton. &#39;Nuf said. It does have a new printed map element, which looks like a combination of a classic pirate map and the Ninjago map from 2011.</p>

<p><strong>Jungle Garmadon&nbsp;</strong>is an interesting figure. The torso extender is a new and inventive use of a part that appeared in 2 2012 sets (Destiny&#39;s Bounty and Epic Dragon Battle). He has a grimace, very similar to the CMF&#39;s, on his face. He is armed with 4<em> katana.</em></p>

<p><strong>Master Wu&nbsp;</strong>appears in many TLNM&nbsp;sets, but this is the cheapest unless you get the Key Chain figure. His cloth robe is a nice piece, but the side and front tend to flare a little bit. He has his classic hat and beard elements and a staff.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>The build is separated into two bags.</p>

<p>Bag one builds half of the cliff.</p>

<p>Bag two builds the other half, the cage, and the bridge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>The model consists of a bridge with a cage hanging over the abyss.The bridge is made out of eleven large track links, and is connected to a cliff on either side.One of these is substantially larger than the other, and features a small Shinto-style gateway made out of Tan parts.Underneath is a small cave that you can fit the skeleton into.The cage features an opening front, so that you can fit a single figure inside.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The set includes lots of rare sand green parts.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>This set is one of the strongest in the whole line, and is very well priced.</p>

"adutt17","2018-01-02T11:29:02.46Z","Master Falls review","<p>This set is good, both in appearance and play value. The cage near the main rope bridge is a brilliant inclusion because you can trap anyone in it, even minifigures recived in other sets from this line.&nbsp;I also think that the inclusion of the cave at the back is a great way to take up and fill extra space. The inclusion of 3 (or 4 minifigures if you&#39;re including the skeleton) for a set of this size is amazing, because it means that you can create a good amount of scenarios to put your minifigures into. I also think that in relation to the movie, putting Jungle Garmadon and Sensei Wu in the same set is very smart. The set also comes with Kai, which is awesome, but I am a little dissapointed that they didn&#39;t put another ninja in place of the skeleton. Still, like mentioned earlier, if you have more minifigures from this line, you can always use those to ramp up the play possibilities.</p>

"PeteM","2019-06-26T19:04:06.01Z","Master Full Set","<p><span style=""font-family:Arial, sans-serif"">My first confession before starting the review is that I haven&rsquo;t seen the Ninjago film so have no knowledge of any scene this set is based on, nor what part it plays in the larger plot. However, I seem to be developing a thing for island-and-bridge-based sets (well OK, just <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/50770"">70604</a> r</span><span style=""font-family:Arial, sans-serif"">eally) and the dynamic artwork used on the box and instructions make it look both suitably action packed, with flying motion blurred figures rampaging across the well displayed set, which is placed against a fairly detailed CGI &lsquo;real world&rsquo; tropical forest background. The instructions take the usual clear approach, completing the build in a fairly leisurely 88 steps, some of which include just one piece, while others have more complicated sub builds.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Parts</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">There&rsquo;s a fairly good selection of different pieces in the set, though nothing in enough quantities to make it as a parts pack unless you have a desperate longing for small clippy pieces or the 11 track linkage elements that are included. &lsquo;Natural&rsquo; earthy colours dominate (as much as shiny ABS can replicate anyway) punctuated by the bright green and blue used for foliage and the river respectively. There is a printed map piece which has only appeared in two other sets (both Ninjago Movie and this is the cheapest one it has appeared in) and there are no stickers (hurrah!)</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Minifigures and accessories</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">There are four minifigures included, though five torsos, as Jungle Garmadon is blessed with an extra thorax, raising intriguing, if un-answerable, questions about his physiological makeup. Does he have multiple copies of organs stacked up in there? Or an extra-long trachea through a mostly empty top half? Sadly we&rsquo;ll never know. Interestingly, I had assumed on first glance that it was two standard torsos fixed together, but the top half is not actually a half, more a &lsquo;smaller portion&rsquo; which has back armour included in the moulding. It turns out that having more chest area just means having more chest hair to display as is evidenced in the excellent printing work across the front of the two torsos (torsi?) which continues onto (thankfully clothed) legs.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Sensei Wu is fairly standard issue &ndash; single faced, of which only a straining furrowed brow really shows behind the well styled beard and usual head covering. Kai looks similarly constipated on one side of his head, with the other featuring a relived looking grin, and sports a hairpiece that is taller than his entire head. Each of the characters gets an appropriate number of weapons to wield including seven Ninja swords (one is the customary spare) and a wooden staff for Wu &ndash; even the skeleton gets in on the act, clutching a grey pointed leaf piece which presumably was a dagger but was clearly was of little use when the chips were down.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">The Build</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Complete in two sections, the parts bags are numbered either 1 or 2, with the first completing the temple entrance atop a rocky cliff, while the second creates the opposite river bank, fills in the river, and the perilous suspended walkway. A cavern for the skeleton comes together quickly, with the rockwork either side angled using A frame pieces and pre-formed rock panels. There are no particularly interesting techniques on show, though the use of skeleton arms to support the bridge and one end is unexpected. Slotting fourteen t-bar pieces into fourteen tubes with clips (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6080355/holder-%C3%B83-2-w-tube-%C3%B83-2-hole"">this piece</a>) is mildly tedious, clipping them all onto two lengths of string with bars (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6096958/string-21m-w-shaft-%C3%B83-2-w-2-knops"">this piece</a>) and getting them all aligned is even more so, depending on your personal perfectionism!</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">Completed Model and Overall Opinion</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">The final result is, if anything, even more detailed and engaging than I expected from the piece count and price point. It is a great snap shot of a physical location as well as providing an engaging scene for action-based play. The extra pictures on the Brickset page show just a few of the range of positions and poses and scenarios that can be played out &ndash; admittedly most of them will revolve around attacking and/or defending the bridge, but the inclusion of three minifigs really expands the options for both creating an interestingly posed display and good old-fashioned play. Seemingly extraneous features like the skeleton&rsquo;s cavern and the prison cell increase this even further, and the proliferation of pieces that can be gripped by the hands of minifigs means you can have them swinging around everywhere.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">One thing the set definitely inspires is the need to extend it in all directions. Both sides of the river could be built up further, with more being added to the (ruined temple?) gateway on one side, while the other side could feature anything at all! As the set is called Master Falls &ndash; which I assume is some kind of play on words but I&rsquo;m choosing to take literally &ndash; you could even extend the river and include a waterfall in a larger diorama. As with all the best Lego sets, it inspires endless possibilities for those with the inclination.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:&quot;Arial&quot;,sans-serif"">That&rsquo;s not to say that the set is lacking &ndash; even without all these additions, the level of detail in fauna, brickwork, the rocks and eddies in the river really make the set look great and, even if you are displayer rather than a player, invites you to move the minifigs around to create different mise-en-sc&egrave;ne. Before this review disappears up itself any further I&rsquo;ll conclude &ndash; this is great little set - to&nbsp;play with, to display, or to provide a jumping off point for moc&rsquo;ing a whole larger scene. Great stuff.</span></p>

<p>To me this was somewhat of an odd set in the range, but in the end a pleasant surprise. It offers quite a few play possibilities and positions to pose the four minifigures in. The build is quite easy, no stickers. That said, fixing the railings is a little tedious and requires a little patience. Overall a good set, and something different from the usual building or vehicle of the Ninjago movie line. Overall OK value for money, and if you are looking for something different from the usual, this is set is definitely worth consideration.</p>

<h2>Build experience.</h2>

<p>The pieces come in two bags, and the build is fairly quick and easy. The least favourite elements for me to build were the cage and the railing for the bridge, the latter above all due to its repetitiveness. Overall the build is quick and easy, and a 7 year old should be able to build this without too many problems. Interesting is the use of droid arms to hold up the bridge floor, the bridge&nbsp;floor built of Technic track links, and the microfigures&nbsp;integrated in the gate. The two black lobsters are nice. There is also a nice amount of foliage included.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;included in this set (four if you include the skeleton): Kai, Master Wu and Garmadon. None of the figures are unique, all of them can be found in other sets. IMHO they are nice, but nothing special.</p>

<p>Garmadon&nbsp;is - in these case - Jungle Garmadon, and can also be found in the Temple of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon (70617). The torso print&nbsp;is nice, and continued on the legs and back of the lower torso. He wears a cloth shoulder piece.</p>

<p>Kai does not wear his Ninja head gear, but instead has hair. He can also be found in the Piranha attack set (70629). The print on the torso is continued onto the legs.</p>

<p>Master Wu can be found in the Green Ninja Mech Dragon (70612). The lower end of his robe is a cloth piece.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The final build begs to be part of a larger scene - a bigger river, more rockface, more overgrown temple structure and so on. Interesting is the choice for the sand-yellow temple structure, which is quite different from the usual red/black temple like structures one usually associates with Japan and the Ninjago line. Overall it looks good, though properly lining up the support ropes of the bridge with the bridge floor is tricky. I am also not a fan of the blue pins plugged into the track pieces (needed to pose figures). Overall, I think it looks nice.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>I would say that this set is mostly a play-set. A hidden skeleton (with a mao), the prison-cage, the steps up the bridge, the support cable (which gives Kai an opportunity to move under the bridge), as a display set this one probably does not work - as said before it rather begs to become part of a wider landscape.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall I think this is a good set. It offers OK value for money within this range, and above all is something different. My primary motive for buying this set was to complete my collection of the Ninjago Movie sets, but having built it I was pleasantly surprised by the looks and the opportunities for play it offers. Overall IMHO this is a good set to add to your collection.</p>
