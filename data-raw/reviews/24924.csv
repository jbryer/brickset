<p>As for the minifigures, I would have to say well done to Lego for the superb bucket feature that appears on Shen-Li because it looks fantastic. As for Cole (who is the only double faced minfig in the set), his torso is well designed with gold mixing with the brown. The shark army minifigs have a very good printed front and also an angry face !</p>

<p>I have highly rated this set, as it was such fun to build and hope to buy more sets of the Ninjago movie theme !!!</p>

<p>This set has been given mixed reviews, and when comparing it to other Ninjago Movie sets, I can see where this is coming from. I myself like this set a lot, mostly because of the look of the bomber itself. Another reason to buy this set is because I am trying to collect the Ninjago&nbsp;Movie line of sets, and this one IMHO definitely belongs in such a collection.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build consists of two parts - the small yellow dingy and the Manta Ray bomber itself, and should not take too long - about 20 to 30 minutes.&nbsp;The dingy is a nice little build, nothing too special. It serves as both an escape device and the cockpit for the bomber, with a pilot and tail gunner seat.</p>

<p>Personally, I liked the build of the Manta Ray bomber itself. The clever use of various parts - like different size wheel wells -&nbsp;makes the aircraft&nbsp;resemble the real animal quite well. Yes, the bottom &#39;lip&#39; of the mouth is missing, but I do not see how this could have been done effectively without&nbsp;compromising the overall design too much.</p>

<p>Good news for sticker-haters: Only two stickers have to be applied (as the warning stripes are printed). Bad news for sticker-haters: These two stickers are big, and located in a highly visible place (the wing tips), and have to be applied with care.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are only four minifigures included in this set, of which apparently three are unique: Cole, Shark Army Great White and Shen-Li. Yet somehow, the minifigures&nbsp;come across as underwhelming and nothing special, the sole exception being Shen-Li - and that mostly because of the buckets he carries.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The aircraft is surprisingly big. The wings are sturdy and solid - not in the least because they are connected by two technic pins. The tail flexes a little, but that does not bother me much. I really like the colour-scheme&nbsp;of white and sand blue.&nbsp; The trigger mechanism for the spring-loaded&nbsp;shooters is cleverly designed, and the shooters themselves are nicely incorporated in the mouth of the aircraft. The designer also did a great job to make the various pieces fit the sometimes awkward angles in the design.</p>

<p>One of the complaints about this set I have come across is the fact that the actual bombs are located on top, while the massive floaters should have been replaced by the actual bombs. This could be, but personally (not in the least because of the rather bee-like striping) if you consider the bombs something like buzz-bombs or fat rockets, that issue is also solved.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Display vs Play</h2>

<p>I personally bought this set above all as a display set. Although I think that it is an okay play-set, personally I think it loses out as a play set to the similarly priced Flying Jelly Sub (set 70610).&nbsp;Although the Manta Ray bomber has great shwoosability, is solid, has two bombs and two spring-loaded missile shooters (activation of which could be slightly easier) this set misses something to bomb or shoot at (other than Cole and Shen-Li).</p>

<p>The Manta Ray bomber is a nice display piece, and is used in great numbers by the Shark Army. As such it is an integral part to any collection of Shark Army equipment. Personally I bought it as a display piece.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Personally I like the Manta Ray bomber, though I can understand where much of the critique of this set is coming from. It suffers from having to compete with the Flying Jelly Sub at this price point. Is it a bad set? No. If you like the looks of the set, definitely go for it. It is not a bad set in itself, as other reviewers have already pointed out. Does it face tough competition from other Ninjago Movie sets at this price point? Definitely.</p>

"adutt17","2018-02-11T05:42:19.093Z","Manta Ray Bomber Review","<p>I think that this set is great. The minifigure selection&nbsp;is great for a $45 set, coming with Cole, Two Shark Army minifigures, and a citizen named Shen-Li. It comes with 3 weapons:a hammer for Cole, a fish sai for the Shark Army Gunner and a fish spike for Great White, along with a shoulder bucket accessory for Shen-Li. The design itself looks really cool, with a manta-ray inspired design (as the name suggests) and a yellow getaway/control boat. The weapons included in the actual design are very limited, basically being a couple of spring loaded shooters at the front of the craft. It also comes with 2 oars at the front of the craft, with can be used with the getaway boat.&nbsp;</p>
