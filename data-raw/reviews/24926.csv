"Bison_Bricks","2017-08-07T00:11:04.17Z","Bigger--and better--than expected...","<p>When the Ninjago&nbsp;Movie sets were announced this looked like the least interesting among all of the ninja mech sets, but the relatively low price point won me over, and I have been pleasantly surprised.&nbsp;<a href=""https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Water-Strider-70611"">Water Strider (70611)</a>&nbsp;is a decent set with some good minifigures&nbsp;included.</p>

<h3>Building Experience</h3>

<p>There is a large amount of Technic pieces (especially in the legs) and uncommon parts&nbsp;in this model. The legs feature a great deal&nbsp;of repetitive duplicate builds; not all four legs are identical however, but two legs are the mirror-image of each other two. This set has a large number of stickers, although they look excellent and add a lot of character to the model.&nbsp;The entire build took me under an hour to complete.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>The minifigures included in this set are good. Nya is included (of course) in her masked Ninja outfit sporting a spear, as well as&nbsp;her brother Kai, wielding two katanas. Two villains are included to battle, including the all too-common Shark Army Thug, and the ridiculous-looking Puffer. Some item for the villains to ride in or a buildable weapon would have been a nice additon.</p>

<p>The Water Strider features a&nbsp;6-stud rapid shooter activated from a nicely-built canister in the rear of the model, highly-poseable legs, a fully-rotating cockpit, and some other poseable&nbsp;features. The legs allow it to stand quite tall or take an extremely wide stance. The color scheme is straight out of Ultra Agents (and looks great).</p>

<p>(As an aside, if you place Nya in the cockpit with her hairpiece--not included--instead of her ninja mask, the hairpiece is too large to allow the windscreen to close. I prefer Nya in her hair, so this was a disappointment.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This model is larger than I was expecting;&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t look diminutive next to Jay&#39;s <a href=""https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Lightning-Jet-70614"">Lightning Jet</a>. And at half the price of that jet&nbsp;($30 in the United States)&nbsp;this set is a very&nbsp;good value when you also consider&nbsp;the decent minifigure selection it includes. Recommended!</p>

"ThePirates123","2018-01-01T17:32:19.07Z","Bigger than I expected","<p>When I picked the set up at the price of 45&euro; I was expecting it to be a quite small set, and especially not as intimidating as it turned out. The time it took me to build it is 30 mins.</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>I didn&#39;t enjoy the build as much, mainly because of the repetition involved in making the legs. The set is comprised of 4 bags, 2 of which are just to construct the legs, which is just (almost) the same (with only the direction being different) build, 4 times. Apart from that, the build was quick and enjoyable.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>I believe that the parts on this set were really cool, there are a few&nbsp;2-stud high 1x1 bricks in trans light blue which look great in the overall construction and are pretty rare as well. Needless to say, many 1x1 round studs which are used for the shooters. There are a bunch of elastic string-like pieces which fit great in the model, a few plate pieces in black for the legs, and some elastic ones of the same size with holes, in trans light blue. There are a few mechanism pieces that make the feet position adjustable and a very very nice cockpit piece up front. I also love the two half-tube like pieces in trans light blue which contribute to the overall mechanism of the 6 stud shooter below the cockpit. All in all, many great pieces, mostly in black and in trans light blue color scheme.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Not gonna lie, the minifigs were definitely not the most exciting part of the set. Kai&#39;s and Nya&#39;s&nbsp;masked versions were pretty boring as they are included in other sets as well and the shark army thug is way too common, something that didn&#39;t drive me all that excited. The puffer figure was pretty funny and the hat looks cool, but apart from the puffer the other minifigures are not unique.</p>

<p>For anyone wanting a full list of minifigures included in the set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kai with mask and&nbsp;with dark grey shoulder pads, two light grey&nbsp;katanas and two faces (angry, surprised/happy)</li>
	<li>Nya with mask and TM weapon (new spear piece), leg fabric and two faces (angry, small smile)</li>
	<li>Shark Army Thug, with orange hat head piece and fish with dark grey&nbsp;claw weapon</li>
	<li>Shark Army Puffer with pink&nbsp;puffer head piece, oxygen tank and fish with medieval head smasher weapon</li>
</ul>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>The set is really playable, being a mech of sorts. I personally find removing the legs and playing only with the main build on top&nbsp;using it as a jet or spaceship more fun and easy, however this construction is bad looking because of the long bar attaching the cockpit with the legs. Other than that, the top part has a few features, like the cockpit (which needs to be completely removed to add or remove a figure or the 6-stud shooter. The cockpit itself doesn&#39;t have much minifig space and will not fit figures with big neck or hair pieces. It also has 3 flags behind which constantly get removed, something which is quite annoying. The legs&#39; position&nbsp;can be adjusted. It takes some force to change it, which is good for me because I know they won&#39;t change position randomly and collapse&nbsp;off the shelf. The legs can be folded quite a bit for many different positions.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model &amp; My Thoughts</h2>

<p>All in all, the set is really intimidating for the 45&euro; price point and I&#39;m glad to get it. It looks great in the collection and I would recommend it. Although it wouldn&#39;t be my first choise, this one is one of the best ninjago mechs.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-31T01:12:53.22Z","Brilliant Addition for the Mecha Fans","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70611 Water Strider:</b> As I noted previously I did not find this film to be as engaging as the other films from LEGO and Warner Brothers, which may be why I&rsquo;ve taken so long to get some of the more expensive sets from the Theme. And the sets are really impressive, I mean some of them look highly engaging and fun to display or play with, while others are a bit cluttered or off putting. As far as the Water Strider is concerned I really enjoyed the set once I finally got it and I&rsquo;m going to explain why during the review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The LEGO Ninjago Movie box design is a lot more subdued in colours, it has darker colours on the box to differentiate it from the more colorful regular Theme boxes from Ninjago. Lloyd is prominent on the front and the sets imagery is very well done on both the front and back of the boxes. The action shot on the back even hints to the Ninjago City docks as Nya&rsquo;s set is fighting on an animated version of the docks, though not based on the set we got to go with NINJAGO City.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The manual for this set is actually rather large, which makes the steps even easier to follow as the pages are laid out quite nicely due to the size. There&rsquo;s a lot of cross promotional elements in the back with checklists and info about The LEGO Ninjago Video Game and some other stuff to look forward to for fans.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are a lot of useful hinge joints, the ones used in the Ice Mammoth set from Legends of Chima for the legs are found here as well as more ball joints with the nice transparent blue colouring the Ice Tribe would have. This helps simulate water effects of course, that being said this set was just loaded with some very nice parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kai: Much like with Lloyd Kai seems to be one of the most numerous Ninja included in sets. He has two swords and a special sheath that he gets to wear to hold them, he&rsquo;s got some very nice printing on his torso and legs for his Ninja outfit and gets to wear the new two piece mask element. His hair piece is not included in this set, his facial expressions seem to be determined and ready for battle as well as a goofy smile on his face on the other.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nya: Nya&rsquo;s facial expressions are pretty much the same as what we saw on her High School Outfit version, but her ninja outfit is a really nice looking metallic grey or black in colour, her print is really impressive and the short cloth skirt also includes some printing. Sadly this piece can be warped when she sits down in her mech and stays there for a long time. I&rsquo;d recommend leaving it off when she&rsquo;s piloting the mech. Everything about the Ninja&rsquo;s outfits from this movie is extremely impressive, I actually like their new designs over the older ninja outfits from the main Theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Puffer: This character shares the same print as the regular Thugs which are sleeveless as seen in other sets, but he gets some unique elements, chief among them the very impressive head piece with the puffer fish design sculpt, this character may or may not be meant to have more than one of them. It&rsquo;s a bit different, he&rsquo;s also wearing an air tank which is a newer element for this Theme and has a fish with a massive hammer build on the end to make it like a fish mace or something, it&rsquo;s a really goofy accessory for him.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Shark Army Thug: This Minifigure features the same prints as most of the other Thugs who wear the dark orange beanie on their heads. This one has a fish with a spike on the end of it for a weapon, not much else to say, fun little trooper to build up for an army.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: The siblings start out constructing the central body of the mech with very little difficulty, all of the steps they follow are quite easy to understand and construction is relatively free of frustrations or annoyances.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The Shark Army joins forces with the Ninja to build the first two legs of the mech with equally few difficult moments. In fact the build is a tad repetitive in certain areas as the legs are pretty much built the same way. Sticker placement begins with this bag as I do not recall any using the first bag.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: This completes the leg builds by making the final two legs, which means that the build here will be very similar to the second bag, however they did mirror the builds as you reverse some of the placement of parts and the angle of the build is different. Stickers continue to be applied for details.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #4: This bag finishes off the legs by making the feet and completing the cockpit section with extra detailing and more use of stickers for detailing. With this final build you complete the finished model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Water Strider: I like the design of this mech, it&rsquo;s like a water skimming insect with four limbs that can be posed using click joints and ball joints for the feet, it also features some very impressive details thanks to the stickers being used here. Two stud shooters are integrated quite nicely into the build and some extra arsenal elements are incorporated into the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set may not be the proper scale compared to the on-screen counterpart, a lot of the mech&rsquo;s seem very small when built. This makes a lot of sense though as the ones seen in the movie were massive and would probably all have cost the price of a Modular or D2C set if made to proper scale.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m honestly pretty impressed with what they could do to make these models&hellip; I only believe that the cockpit could have used a little bit more tweaking to make it fully enclosed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is 50$ in Canada. I&rsquo;m really pleased I waited until it was reduced for retirement because paying 40$ for this set is really a much better deal considering there are only 4 Minifigures. And the size of the model doesn&rsquo;t really scream 50$, I mean it is actually roughly the same height as The Scuttler, but it isn&rsquo;t as involved a build as The Scuttler turned out to be. That being said I&rsquo;d still recommend this set as it does include some great characters and a very impressive looking model. Plus I&rsquo;m a huge fan of Nya in general so any set with her in it is a must buy for me. Highly recommended.</p>

"LEGODUDE1","2018-04-23T06:08:57.587Z","Repetetive Buisness ","<p>The Water Strider is an immensely complex Lego set. The legs are the main treasure of the model, even if it is a bit repetitive building them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The piece count is 494 pieces, though Brickset says the count is 544,&nbsp;probably because of all the little studs it shoots. I&nbsp;do recommend that if the Lego group ever redesigns this set, they should find a smaller way to shoot the studs, and not use the water tank in the back.</p>

<p>A lot of people enjoy this model, and it is an honor to be the owner of such a wonderful model, as&nbsp;not many kids my age own a ninja mech. I&nbsp;hope other people get this set and enjoy it as much as I&nbsp;did.</p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-06-22T09:08:39.69Z","Great value for money!","<p>Each of the Ninjas vehicles from the Lego Ninjago Movie look unique and interesting. Nya has the cheapest vehicle but that in no way detracts from the set because the skinny design makes it look about the same size as the other vehicles and it plays just as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The Minifigures</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nya: Nya looks fantastic in gunmetal grey and is definitely my favourite minifigure in the set. Her two piece hood is dual moulded in black and her characteristic gunmetal grey. She has her standard expressions with a smile and a scowl. The torso print looks awesome, it&rsquo;s also gunmetal grey but with silver and light blue highlights. She has fantastic arm printing which is a rare treat. The figure has a cloth armour skirt piece which has a great print. Unfortunately when you place Nya in the vehicle it damages the cloth piece. I wish either the skirt wasn&rsquo;t included or Nya&rsquo;s seat accommodated the piece better. Her legs only have sandals printed on them, and she comes with a tassled spear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kai: Kai has the same hood piece as Nya, this time in black and red. His face print shows a smile and a grimace, and he has a Band-Aid on his forehead. I love the shoulder armour piece; it&#39;s gunmetal grey and can hold two katanas over the same shoulder. His torso is red with black and gold highlights. The legs are black, with a red diamond pattern on them which looks great. He carries two silver katanas. While not as good as Nya, Kai is nonetheless a great figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Puffer: This is one of my favourite members of the shark army. Puffer wears a lavender coloured puffer fish helmet with a clear visor which looks superb. His mean frown is appropriate and I also like the armour/air tank piece. It&rsquo;s also gunmetal grey with a print showing its battery life. The torso and legs are both standard and not particularly interesting although they are well detailed. For a weapon he uses a fish club.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shark army thug: The unnamed thug in this set has good prints on his face, torso and legs but is not very interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The design of the Nya&rsquo;s water strider is unlike any Lego model I&#39;ve seen before. It resembles the insect that it&rsquo;s named after with four &ldquo;arms&rdquo; and a central &ldquo;body&rdquo;. The colour scheme is great. As Nya is the Water Ninja her colour should be blue, but as Jay also has a blue colour scheme this model needed to look different. The compromise was for the set to be black and grey with transparent blue highlights which looks great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legs have two points of articulation; a ratcheted joint for the knee, and a ball joint for the feet. The articulation allows for interesting poses which is one of my favourite aspects of the set.</p>

<p>The body is attached to the legs with a ratcheted turntable with 360 degrees of movement so you can angle the head while the legs remain stationary. A large canopy piece can be removed to give you easy access to the cockpit. The backrest is built up nicely but as I wrote earlier, sitting Nya on her legs damages her cloth skirt. This set doesn&rsquo;t have a clip to hold Nya&rsquo;s spear whereas the other Ninja&rsquo;s vehicles do, which I find incredibly frustrating. In my experience as the spear can&rsquo;t be stored on the vehicle it is easily lost and there is plenty of space on the legs where a clip could be placed. The cockpit has two steering handles, and a cylinder on the back can turn to shoot off a six stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is very well detailed, partially due to the placement of stickers which I don&#39;t find too frustrating. The pads on the underside of the feet are transparent light blue radar dishes, and each foot has a sticker detail. Each leg also has a sticker detail with the word &ldquo;strider&rdquo; written on it to good effect. Silver and grey pipes add detail to the legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;body&rdquo; has the most detail. Blue gun tips face forward, built up radar dishes adorn the sides and two cannons are mounted on the roof. The back of the model has a cluster of stickered flags on it that fan out nicely. Two fins on the back are attached with Mixel style ball joints and can be angled well. A transparent blue cylinder is the most striking part of the back of the model and it is the trigger for the six stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The Build and Parts&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The building experience is good due to the interesting shape and nice details, although it&#39;s not amazing, as the legs are a bit repetitive. The parts are also good, as you can see, I especially like the amount of gun metal grey included.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is incredible value for $70. The parts are used very well and give this set great presence. The figures are good, especially Nya, it has good articulation and the build looks fantastic. I highly recommend this set.&nbsp;<br />
