"Bison_Bricks","2017-08-15T19:29:02.807Z","Excellent, especially for children!","<p>I am very satisfied with&nbsp;the <a href=""https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Temple-of-The-Ultimate-Ultimate-Weapon-70617"">Temple of the Ultimate&nbsp;Ultimate Weapon (70617)</a>. The minifigure&nbsp;selection and play value are outstanding. Here are some thoughts about the set...</p>

<ul>
	<li>The minifigures&nbsp;selection is excellent; the only way it could have been improved upon would have been the addition of Master Wu, but he may not be relevant to this scene in the movie, so his omission might be appropriate.</li>
	<li>This is the only set so far to feature&nbsp;the ninjas with their faces and hair instead of their masks. This look since&nbsp;it shows off their personalities better.</li>
	<li>This Jungle&nbsp;Garmadon&nbsp;is the same one as in 70609 Master Falls, and he is also my favorite version of Garmadon&nbsp;in this wave.</li>
	<li>The temple is simply PACKED with play features and details. My only wish is that they sacrificed some of the height (it&#39;s very tall) for a little more depth (it&#39;s very shallow) so there was more floor space in the rooms to set up minifigures.</li>
	<li>The temple is also packed with stickers! A few small pieces are printed. This set might look bland without the stickers, though.</li>
	<li>Aesthetic-wise, the color scheme is quite handsome, and&nbsp;the area above the front doors is especially well-designed.</li>
	<li>Is it fair to say that this architecture looks more Japanese (think Himeji Castle), while the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70751-1/Temple-of-Airjitzu"">Temple of Airjitzu</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70728-1/Battle-for-Ninjago-City"">Battle for Ninjago&nbsp;City</a> look more Chinese?&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Build time was just under three hours.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>This set represents a great value. If I were to only get one set (for a child)&nbsp;in the entire Ninjago&nbsp;Movie line it would be this one: you get every ninja, the main antagonist,&nbsp;loads of play features and details&nbsp;and hours of play. Maybe it&#39;s not the ultimate ultimate set, but it&#39;s pretty darn close.</p>

"lentil","2017-09-12T16:31:25.347Z","Medieval Japanese Castle - yummy!!!","<p>Fair warning: I am going to gush about this set throughout the entire review :-)</p>

<p>Why? Incredibly beautiful, super fun to play with, and a fantastic value to boot. Highly recommended for kids and AFOLs, especially anyone who is any kind of castle fan.</p>

<h3>The Temple</h3>

<p>The primary build is a very tall temple, which seems to have been inspired by medieval Japanese architecture. Although it is a &quot;temple,&quot; it has a castle-like feel for sure. I think the design is really effective - looks awesome from the front on a shelf or in a layout. Here are some of my favorite points aesthetically:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The restrained color scheme looks very sophisticated (Earth blue and light gray, with accents of dark gray and tan), and the huge bright red doors really pop on this severe background. I also love the use of dark red on the front steps.</li>
	<li>The uneven rockwork around the foundation and on the steps adds a nice element of realism and depth to the design. The craggy, uneven steps insert a brilliant splash of asymmetry to what is otherwise a very ordered and symmetrical design.</li>
	<li>The multi-tiered roof and tall tower are quite elegant. Especially love the use of the four earth blue scorpions (a new color for these!) on the roof as a decorative element.</li>
	<li>In general, the detailing throughout is subtle yet very effective. There is some creative use of various shapes above the door and on the roof for decorative purposes which is interesting and looks really good. I also love the use of window-less window frames stacked in front of solid bricks to create the look of Japanese panels on the upper stories.</li>
	<li>That gorgeous red tiled door with its silver metallic hinges, beautifully sunken within two layers of frames. It feels heavy and you can almost hear the creak as it opens...</li>
	<li>I like the graphic design of the stickers around the door, and some of the interior panels. Some of the interior stickers are more cartoonish, and AFOLs may prefer to leave them off. The set could lose a few stickers with no harm in my opinion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interior</h3>

<p>Inside the temple there are several spaces: the large two-story great hall, four smaller rooms containing weapons, armor, and scrolls, and two tiny attic spaces which could barely fit a minifigure, but could be used to store items (and where the red spider lives). Underneath the great hall and main story are two dungeon/cellar rooms, one with two barred doors that can be opened and closed, and one with a more open format containing a partial skeleton and a pit of snakes. There is also a creepy hanging bone cage that can be attached to the back or the temple at either side, and angled in various directions.</p>

<p>There is no furniture to speak of, just a few weapons and containers, an armored knight, a scroll stand, and a pretty white vase. The rooms are very narrow and other than the great hall pretty small, so there is really no room to add furnishings anyway. Action seems to be the game plan here, not sitting around on cushy furniture!</p>

<h3>Play Features</h3>

<p>This set is not just some fancy display piece. It was clearly designed to be played with and is chock full of really fun play elements. My daughter, who is 11 and has no interest in Ninjago at all (thinks ninjas are &quot;weird&quot;) actually loves this set! She and her (female) friends have played with it quite a bit, because it is just so fun. (I&#39;m sure boys would have just as much/more fun with it, as they might be into the fighting elements as well. The girls basically ignore all the swords, but do love putting people in the dungeons and using the booby traps!) Interactive/play features include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A wheel that can hoist a large rock suspended on a chain above the high entrance hall, to be dropped on intruders. This feature works very well and is a huge hit!</li>
	<li>A turning knob and container that can dump items (such as the TNT box provided) down from a second floor balcony.</li>
	<li>A small platform at the back that can be pulled out to release a trapdoor under the floor of the great hall, flushing unwanted visitors out under the front steps.</li>
	<li>A knob that controls a large hidden sword that swipes through the air of the front hall to chop any intruders that happen to be flying thereabouts.</li>
	<li>A button to fire metal disks towards the entrance from under the scroll stand.</li>
	<li>A lever to burst open a wall of one of the dungeon rooms.</li>
	<li>A wooden crate hiding a secret cache of golden flowers.</li>
	<li>It&#39;s also generally fun to use all the various spaces in this temple - putting people into the dungeons, the bone cage, and all the various rooms.</li>
	<li>The multi-tiered roof is well-designed for play too. Since the roof has so many levels and is studded, there are LOTS of places that ninjas and/or attackers can perch all over the building. It has been fun to see how the kids exploit all the nooks and crannies of this great structure.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Eight are included, an assortment of six ninjas, plus Jungle Garmadon and an armored statue figure. The armored statue is my favorite - his medieval Japanese armor looks stunning! He has a plain gray body and gray head with printed face. I also like this Nya a lot - she sports a fabric &quot;armored&quot; skirt, and has a great hairdo and cute printed elbows. Kai also has a sweet double-sword holder.</p>

<h3>Stone Lions</h3>

<p>The brick-built stone lions are superb! They have articulated joints at the hips, ankles, shoulders, neck, jaw, and even eyebrows and ears, so they are really posable and fun to play with. Very well designed - it really works here that they are brick-built, because they are of course supposed to be stone, so the blockiness of the shapes seems perfectly natural. They look great on display and I love that there is a matching set of two.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>You can see the ratio of the price and the piece count yourself... the Ninjago Movie sets are all very decently priced, but this one especially seems like almost a steal. (And with the 20% off discount I snagged, eye-popping for a just-released set.) For comparison, this set is about 3/4 the piece count of #70751 Temple of Airjitzu at half the RRP. (And although I love my Airjitzu very much, the Ultimate Temple is a more &quot;together&quot; and sophisticated design overall in my opinion.)</p>

<p>Beyond just the bricks I&#39;d say this set represents excellent play value as well, since so much fun is packed into a small space. It also helps that the model is so tall and flat - it seems even larger than its actual piece count would predict as a result. Finally, the lack of any gratuitous vehicles or ancillary side builds means all the pieces go into one big build of awesomeness!</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>As you can tell I really love this set. It is &quot;old-school,&quot; in the sense that it&#39;s recalling the classic castle theme, and is designed at its core to be a truly fun toy for kids. But it is simultaneously very contemporary, exploiting the best of modern LEGO design possibilities with new colors, techniques, and shapes, and appealing to AFOL design sensibilities as well. I love sets that are winners in both areas like this, since this is LEGO at its best in my opinion, and is a feat that is especially hard to accomplish.</p>

"BelgianBricker","2019-07-19T09:07:32.283Z","A retro arcade side-scrolling platform game!","<p>I finally got this beautiful temple in the mail yesterday and started building right away. After 3,5 hours I had a massive rockbuild, stone temple sitting on my dinner table, with my 2yo son making &quot;growl&quot;- sounds while hopping the 2 stone lions around: instant success :D</p>

<p>Lets have an in-dept view/review of this incredible build!</p>

<h3>BOX</h3>

<p>The box is way bigger then I expected. Having build the &quot;Monastery&nbsp;of Spinjitzu&quot; just a few days prior, I thought both boxes would be of the same size, but they were not. Although &quot;The Temple of the Ultimate Ultimate weapon&quot; comes with only 300 pieces more then the monastery, its box is twice as thick. It strikes me as strange seeing the vast amount of empty space in the box after opening it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box artwork is great, as we come to expect. The temple is featured from a frog-perspective, which makes the entire model even more impressive. Some photoshopping is used here and there to give the picture some extra detailing. The back of the box sports pictures of the different action features, I especially like the picture of Kay cuddling with one of the stone lions: a beautiful, although maybe not very realistic sight :D</p>

<h3>BUILD/INSTRUCTIONS</h3>

<p>We start of with building both stone lions. They really are amazing and for me, the highlight of this set. The posable legs, head, mouth and even eyebrows make these figures an absolute joy. The most amazing thing about these figures is that by changing the position of the brows, you can actually give these lions different expressions: from angry/mad to happy or even submissive, a real treat.</p>

<p>After the lions we start building the temple from the bottom up. Finishing off with the bone-cage and the steps to the entrance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is fun and fast paced, although somewhat repetitive: there is a lot of symmetry or near symmetries. The instructions try to overpass this problem by making you do different steps when building the same thing. This is most noticeable when building the basement of the temple. Sometimes the instructions are hard to read because of the darkness of the printing. This&nbsp;problem occurs mostly when building the darkblue roof&nbsp;of the temple. There were many occasions I really had to look closely to the pictures to actually see what was happening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some bright, contrasting colors are used here and there for supporting pieces, but I am very happy to see that none of these are visible in the finished model. Nor are there any large technic pieces&nbsp;that are too much in your face. It is a common problem with LEGO models these days however and it is really a shame, because it should not be.</p>

<p>The model relies heavily on stickers. The interior stickers are, as mentioned in other reviews, a bit childish or to comical. The exterior stickers are however fabulous. Are they necessary? Well, the exterior stickers are a necessity to give the entrance gate that little bit of extra detailing. The interior wall stickering isn&#39;t necessary, but useful to break the otherwise overly dominating gray color scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final model is quite impressive, mostly because of its multi-layered structure and hight, the superb rooflines&nbsp;and that huge bright red door. I&nbsp;do feel however&nbsp;that it is smaller then I would have expected. Especially when placing it next to the monastery, which, although it has 300&nbsp;pieces less, looks more voluminous.&nbsp;<br />
The Temple is also pretty narrow, making it hard to place figures inside the different rooms. The most upper rooms are even unusable and can only serve a purpose as storage places. Its narrowness is this builds biggest downside.&nbsp;1 or 2 extra studs in width, would have made a world of difference and enhanced playability greatly.</p>

<h3>MINIFIGURES</h3>

<p>The set comes with 8&nbsp;minifigures: your 6&nbsp;ninjago ninjas, Garmadon and a samurai statue.</p>

<p>The figures are nice, with beautiful printing, some arm-prints here and there, but nothing overly special. I would have liked to have and the hairpieces and the ninja-masks. Garmadon is and always will be an amazing figure: this double hight, 4-armed madman is my personal favorite, together with the samourai-statue, which has an amazing double sided face-print and armorpiece.</p>

<h3>PLAY</h3>

<p>Above all, this set is a playset. There are lots of this to do and stories to make up when playing with this set. We get: 2 dungeons, a secret dungeon wall, 2 removable dungeon gates, a trap door walkway, a treasure chest, a dropping boulder, a swinging sword, a shooting disk, a TNT-launcher, an animated statue, 2 stone lions, a bone-cage...wow. This almost feels like one of these retro arcade side-scrolling platform games...and I love every bit of it :D</p>

<p>The play features are integrated in the final model pretty well: they are out of sight, without any of them being to visible or marked with big red knobs. I especially like the dropping boulder. The mechanism is similar to the way the arms on the &quot;Spyrius&nbsp;Robo-guard work&quot;. It is simple yet very effective.</p>

<h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3>

<p>PROS<br />
-stone lions<br />
-great minifigures<br />
-action features<br />
-that amazing huge bright red door</p>

<p>CONS<br />
-could have used one or two extra studs to increase posability of the figures</p>
