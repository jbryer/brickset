I absolutely loved the original two Ghostbusters films and have to admit I thought it a great shame that they didn&#39;t get a full LEGO game instead of just a Dimensions Level pack, so I was very curious to see how the new Story Packs compare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Dimensions Story Packs add a new size of box to the LEGO Dimensions packs, opting for a more traditional box than the angular shaped hanging display style boxes of the other expansion packs. The branding clearly ties together with the main Starter pack branding, but in all honesty it doesn&#39;t scream LEGO to look at. I think this is mostly down to the background image continuing over the entire box so there is no theme colour branding. This is probably a sensible choice as the brand needs to match Dimensions rather than Ghostbusters but it could have been done to look a little more in line with standard LEGO set box designs.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p><br />
From an initial glance I wasn&#39;t too interested in the parts included, however once I started building I was pleasantly surprised. There are a lot of 1x1 round plates, in fact one of the small bags included is almost entirely dedicated to these, so the parts count looks perhaps a little more impressive than it really is. However most of these are used to go effect so it doesn&#39;t feel like it was done to mislead buyers at all, just something to be aware of if you are an advocate of price per piece budgeting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most pleasant surprise in terms of parts were the black ingots - part &nbsp;6156991. While this is perhaps not the most versatile part it does allow for a different finish to standard studs or tiles so more colours of this are something I readily welcome.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><br />
Only one minifigure, Abby Yates is included in the set, which is a little disappointing. For the RRP and gameplay I&#39;d have really liked to have seen these Story Packs contain at least two characters. Fortunately this version of the character is slightly different to the figure in 75828, having a different face print and legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>While the majority of the main build is fairly straightforward, involving mainly straight stacking of bricks, it is very effective for this size model. Additional detailing in the roof and small gadgets to break this up and give a satisfying build experience. I found I was particularly pleased with the proton pack, which appears identical to set 75828, is far superior in design to that featured in 21108 which always looked a little too bulky for my liking.</p>

<p>As well as the new gateway, this set includes a mini Ecto-1. The minibuilds in the Dimensions packs have been widely debated, some people love them while others really dislike them. I have to admit I fall somewhere in the middle, I like the stylised designs and think that the &quot;iconic vehicles&quot; (e.g BTTF DeLorean, Ecto-1, Mystery Machine) are genuinely nice as mini versions of what they are, I also agree with the criticism that they could be much better for the price being paid. Often I think the rebuilding game feature, while very relevant for a LEGO game, probably put some rather unfortunate restrictions on design for these vehicles. This&nbsp;mini Ecto-1 is great, I think it&#39;s accurate enough to be identified and looks less cartoony than some of the other mini vehicles.</p>

<h3>Digital Content</h3>

<p><br />
For me this was where I considered most of the value to be when choosing to preorder the game. One big disappointment I had with the first year of LEGO Dimensions packs were the Level Packs. For the RRP the Level Packs didn&#39;t feel like good value, particularly in terms of digital content. I found that film franchises like Back to the Future or Ghostbusters could have easily had enough content for full games, so cramming one of the franchise&#39;s films into a single level felt a bit of a disservice to fans.</p>

<p>Having several levels this does feel closer to a traditional LEGO Video game, however being part of the toys to life (TTL) range means that this does not feel as complete as some of the older LEGO games. I was however very pleased to find that this pack does allow two players to play as characters from the Ghostbusters 2016 franchise at once. I&#39;m curious to see how this translates with the upcoming Fantastic Beasts Story pack as there is also a fun pack coming out along side it.</p>

<p>As this is the first year two pack I bought it also gave access to a new mode of play, the Battle Arena. It&#39;s often been noted that the LEGO Video games, whilst great for co-op, haven&#39;t really offered anything in the way of a competitive multiplayer experience. Personally I don&#39;t think it was needed in previous games, but there is a logic to the new game mode in a multiverse mash up story like Dimensions, it allows score settling on which characters are the best and helps justify the high RRPs on much of the Dimensions sets. The battle arena gameplay didn&#39;t really appeal very much to me, it&#39;s fun but not so much as to become a massive draw. One very nice surprise to this new mode was the commentary provided by Brian Blessed.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s often hard to figure out if Dimensions sets are good value for money, but to me this set breaks down quite fair, &pound;10 for the physical LEGO and &pound;30 for the digital content doesn&#39;t seem too far off, given the discount I purchased it at I certainly feel like I got fair value for money.</p>

"mcleod4568","2016-10-10T10:41:49.28Z","A very buggy game - hope it is fixed soon.","<p>I was very excited to receive this story pack and looked forward to playing it which I did. I finished it but it was not without it&#39;s problems. Aiming&nbsp;and flying with characters was glitched throughout and would often not work. The sound on the final level was glitched. And worst of all the game glitched so bad that all my progress in the ghostbusters story levels and some gold bricks in various adventure worlds was wiped. So I have to do them again after redownloading the dlc from the store as I&nbsp;was advised to do.</p>

<p>Please wait until there is an update to fix these problems before buying this!</p>

Her accessory is the proton pack which can be stored on the Gateway and an Ecto-Gauntlet which allows her to charge electricity into her body and re-distribute it&hellip; at least in the game that&rsquo;s what her unique ability is. Even her facial expressions seem to be identical, so overall there isn&rsquo;t much to differentiate her from her Ecto-1 &amp; 2 counterpart.</span></span></span></span></p>

This is the first time you use stickers on parts in a LEGO Dimensions set, the build is a tad more involved than the original Gateway build because it has sliding doors, and extra plates that extend the gateway to the sides making it slightly longer than the original Gateway build.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a solid model and looks great even if you don&rsquo;t want to include it on the Toy Pad, as it does make a nice display set, it&rsquo;s nice to have this to dress up your Toy Pad with too as it gives you options and ideas to start building your own Gateways.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Ecto-1 is great, a fun little miniature model version of the vehicle from the 2016 Ghostbusters movie. The Ectozer looks great. It has a solid look to it and serves the role of secondary model perfectly, I love the way they made a ghost busting bulldozer in this miniature form and wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing somebody try to make a full-scale Minifigure compatible version.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s goofy looking because the tires are included, I think leaving the tires off would have made this a more convincing looking flying model. The digital version of the model has a different profile and seems to be slightly wider with more space from the front to the back which makes it look marginally better. This, to me, says that the model could have used more plates.</span></span></span></span></p>

Lord Vortech and his story have nothing to do with anything here though aside from causing the existence of this new Keystone appearing in the game.</span></span></span></span></p>

Some of these glitches have probably been corrected by the patches, but I do not know for certain. All I can say is that on my first play through one level caused me to fail at activating the new Keystone properly forcing me to reset and the final area of the last stage caused a massive glitch with the sound which created a high-pitched wailing and screeching that was super annoying and wouldn&rsquo;t go away until reset. Other than that everything else seemed to work out fine.</span></span></span></span></p>

I have no one else to play with so I simply tried this feature once, it seemed to work fairly well enough, but I recall it causing a bad glitch where the game just froze up after a while forcing me to reset to fix it. Abby unlocks the Ghostbusters Connection Dimension as it&rsquo;s called, I can&rsquo;t say too much about it as I never ventured or explored them too thoroughly.</span></span></span></span></p>

Iconic landmarks are represented and you get to explore a lot of places. Everything on The Shard seems to suffer from glitches worse than the main adventure from Series 1 though as, again, the screen froze out and knocked my character into a void of nothingness when attempting to solve a simple puzzle, forcing me to reset. Other than that the puzzles and exploration of the Adventure World is still great.</span></span></span></span></p>
