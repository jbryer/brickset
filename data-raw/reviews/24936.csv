"Shib","2016-11-19T16:23:41.697Z","Speeding Through Nostalgia","<p>Whe&nbsp;the first LEGO Dimensions Year 2 trailer was released the addition of Sonic the Hedgehog was kept as the final surprise reveal of the video. Frankly I&#39;ve been excited to pick this pack up from that point on. While many of the later Sonic games have had limited success, in the 90s Sonic (and a certain red hatted plumber) were the two biggest computer game icons, as such I&#39;m glad to see Sonic making his way to the LEGO world, even if it currently remains only in a limited way.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As with all the Level Packs so far, only one minifigure is included, Sonic.</p>

<p><img alt=""Sonic (front)"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5590/30305820843_79238b506a_m.jpg"" style=""width: 160px; height: 240px;"" />&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=""Sonic (back)"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5807/30969878722_bf06c372b1_m.jpg"" style=""width: 194px; height: 240px;"" /></p>

<p>The figure is as good of a representation of the character as you could possible expect. The torso features a very basic chest print on the front and some back spikes and a small tail print to the rear. The spikes appear a little flat next to the molded head, but I think having an additional part made just for that small detail would have been excessive.</p>

<p>The Legs have used the dual molding to creat sonics red and white shoes while keeping the top of the legs blue. While this is probably the best result LEGO could achieve with the current techniques the lack of print on the inside and rear of the legs still leaves a little bit of unfinished detail, but it&#39;s only a problem with close inspection.</p>

<p>The new moulded head piece has an excellent sculpt, it certainly looks as accurate as any other toy of Sonic I have seen.</p>

<h3>Minibuild 1: Sonic Speedster</h3>

<p><img alt=""Sonic Speedster"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5639/30305837233_2a139c595d_m.jpg"" style=""width: 240px; height: 202px;"" />&nbsp; <img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5613/30969902072_9589437252_m.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The first of the two vehicles included is a mini version of the Sonic Speedster. To anyone who is only familiar with the earliest incarnations of Sonic, this probably appears to be a rather pointless vehicle invented for this game. This is not actually the case, it is based on the Speed Star, which was originally created for the game&nbsp;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing.</p>

<p><img alt=""The original Speed Star"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5701/31113462455_87a2166582_n.jpg"" style=""width: 320px; height: 140px;"" /></p>

<p>At this scale I think that the designers have made the LEGO version as true to the original material as possible. Even without the knowledge of the source material the Sonic Speedster is definitely well designed to look like a Sonic themed vehicle.</p>

<p>The second rebuild is the Blue Typhoon. I&#39;ll admit, this build I am not a huge fan of, I didn&#39;t recognise the name from any Sonic franchise I was aware of and the build doesn&#39;t look massively appealing.</p>

<p><img alt=""Blue Typhoon (Front)"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5573/30969823712_d705c03bfe_m.jpg"" style=""width: 240px; height: 198px;"" />&nbsp;</p>

<p>A little research did show that the Blue Typhoon probably did take it&#39;s roots from a Sonic franchise, the cartoon Sonic X featured a large star ship called the Blue Typhoon. To be fair a Microscale star ship is about what came to mind when I first looked at this build, but it bears absolutely no similarities to it&#39;s namesake. This is one minor issue I have with a lot of the Dimensions packs, some of the alternate builds are completely random and restriced in design by the need to use the exact same parts as the main build.</p>

<p>The third and final rebuild of this minibuild is the Moto Bug. Long term fans of the series might recognise the name as motobugs have appeared in a lot of Sonic media, right the way back to the first game. However, this is another build that is very different to it&#39;s namesake</p>

<p><img alt=""MotoBug"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5801/31112239525_500f1e9a7c_m.jpg"" style=""width: 240px; height: 163px;"" />&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""MotoBug Back"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5802/30305752463_96c73ab009_m.jpg"" style=""width: 240px; height: 184px;"" /></p>

<p>While this looks very different to a Motobug as they have previously appeared in Sonic titles, you can at least see elements that the designer has tried to incorporate.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/chroniclesofillusion/images/b/b5/Moto_bug.png/revision/latest?cb=20140614062636"" style=""width: 184px; height: 137px;"" /></p>

<p>Like the robotic enemy, the vehicle features claws at the front, large teeth and a rounded blue &#39;face&#39; to the front. For a very limited parts selection it&#39;s not a terrible representation, but without the parts restriction something much better could easily be achieved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minibuild 2: The Tornado</h3>

<p>As soon as I saw images of this I recognised it as Tails&#39; plane from Sonic 2. One of my favourite gaming memories is playing the Sky Chase Zone level on Sonic 2 so I was thrilled to see the plane included.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5823/30745223050_1a1c1f9852_m.jpg"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The colouring of this build has taken more of an influence from the later games, but it&#39;s similar enough to the original to satisfy fans of the older games too. As with all the Dimensions vehicles, the scale is a little cartoon like, the propeller in particular looks a little out of scale with the rest of the plane, but as a stylised Biplane at this scale the design is effective.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://orig08.deviantart.net/0e4b/f/2016/027/6/7/sonic_and_tails_on_the_tornado_by_banjo2015-d9pky93.png"" style=""width: 200px; height: 173px;"" /></p>

<p>Some small changes might have made the design more accurate, but with this kind of scale, and the alternate models in mind, I think this is a good enough representation.</p>

<p>The second rebuild of this give us a far better take on another Sonic enemy, Crabmeat.</p>

<p><img alt=""CrabMeat"" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5631/30969793762_2b49feedfb_m.jpg"" style=""width: 240px; height: 144px;"" />&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=""Crabmeet in Sonic 2"" src=""http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/sonicwiki/images/b/bc/Crab_Meat.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20120811194522&amp;path-prefix=de"" style=""width: 116px; height: 91px;"" /></p>

<p>This is one of my favourite Dimesions alternate builds. I think it has a strong resembelance to the original games. As another enemy that has appeared in multiple titles the choice to include it as an alternate build was a good idea, and I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d have ever considered the possibility of turning the Tornado into a Crabmeat. The digital element features a completely different design of Crabmeat as an in game enemy, which is much closer to the original, but obviously didn&#39;t have such a heavey restriction on parts for the design.</p>

<p>The final version of this vehicle is the Eggcatcher, a sort of flying robot of some kind.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5602/31076436256_621a67676a_m.jpg"" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve dug around the internet a bit and can find no mention of this aside from LEGO Dimensions, so of all the stuff included in the pack this seems to be the only one that has no connection to any existing source material. It&#39;s not the most interesting vehicle, but the arms do make nice use of the new 1x1 round plate with bar (http://brickset.com/parts/6157554) to&nbsp;allow quite a lot of posability&nbsp;for such a small model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Digital Content</h3>

<p>As well as digital versions of Sonic and the minibuild vehicles, this pack give you a whole new level to play, access to a Sonic world to explore and a Sonic Battle arena.</p>

<p>From trailers of this pack I had high hopes for the level, and I was definitely not disappointed. It is full of little easter eggs to a huge range of Sonic games, it even starts with the classic SEGA opening that fans of the Megadrive games can&#39;t help but smile at. They very cleverly started the level on a facsimile of the Sonic 1 Greenhill Zone. While the speed doesn&#39;t handel quite as well as a traditional Sonic game, I think Tt have done a good job of simulating a&nbsp;bit of classic Sonic gaming into the LEGO Dimensions software.</p>

<p>The further I played, the more my smile grew! After&nbsp;completing the first section of the level Sonic gets transported to Sonic 2 Bonus stage - running along a half pipe. This bought&nbsp;back so many memories of playing the classic games, it has been so cleverly thought out.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;gameplay references a lot of later Sonic games too,&nbsp;a lot of the supporting characters make an appearance, even some of the more obscure&nbsp;characters like Big the Cat. But at&nbsp;it&#39;s core this is the sort of&nbsp;experience that will appeal to anyone who has played any of the Sonic games. My favourite reference is in Sonic&#39;s reaction to realising he&#39;ll need to&nbsp;visit the Labyrinth Zone.</p>

<p>As well as a lot of great Sonic reference, there is a lot of connection made to the LEGO Dimensions story too. Wyldstyle, Batman &amp; Gandalf make a brief appearance and the main premise of the level involves Robotnik (yes I&#39;m old enough to consider this the true name of Dr Eggman) having the keystone powers. The level also ends on a cliffhanger, leading me to believe that some more content (perhaps the mysterious <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Dimensions/subtheme-Connectable"">connectable packs</a>)&nbsp;will link a lot of the year two content into the main storyline.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking forward to getting this since it was first rumoured and it&#39;s definitely lived up to expectations. It seems (in the UK at least) that the year 2 Dimensions packs are following a pricing pattern more typical of video games than LEGO toys, so deals are becoming more readily available - this was available for preorder at 33% off. If you have any connection to the Sonic franchise I&#39;d definitely recommend picking this up.</p>

"AdamDaLegoGuy","2017-06-04T02:01:21.583Z","Even better than what I expected","<p>Minifigure: This is the first minifigure of Sonic to ever have been released, and thank goodness Lego did it well. He doesn&rsquo;t have much printing on him, which he should not, and his head mold actually looks just like Sonic.&nbsp;I just wish Lego had used a Lord of the Rings ring piece and not a swim buoy.</p>

<p>Builds: The plane build on the set looks better than what pictures assumed; I thought the rotor would be flimsy and look awkward on the craft, but it was done well. The car cleverly uses pieces to make it not look bulky, but also give it enough volume for it to not&nbsp;just look like an ordinary car.</p>

<p>Gameplay: As good as the LEGO in the set is, the gameplay is what most of&nbsp;the $30 is worth in my opinion - which I did not expect. The level&nbsp;is&nbsp;just like the Sonic games: quickly paced with obstacles and challenges throughout the whole level. You fight the classic Robotnik (Dr. Eggman) and all of the voices for the characters are fitting. The adventure world is large, colorful, and screams Sonic. Not to mention that it is full&nbsp;of areas to run around in as Sonic (because that&rsquo;s&nbsp;what we all want to do, right?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: On the whole, both the physical and digital material that you get in this pack do a good job converting Sonic into Lego, and it very well&nbsp;may open the door for Sonic Lego sets in the future...</p>

If LEGO had decided to cast this in pearl gold plastic it may have been better received. Oh sure, making it chrome might have been too costly, but at least the pearl gold plastic would have worked better than simple plain LEGO Yellow. (I don&rsquo;t like the use of the toilet seat element for other reasons obviously, but would grudgingly accept it if it matched the box imagery.)</span></span></span></span></p>

One of Doctor Eggman&rsquo;s iconic looking robots, this model&rsquo;s build is relatively simple, but admittedly not very in-game accurate. We&rsquo;ll get to that in the finished model section, but I find this build to be a tad weak.</span></span></span></span></p>

So they incorporated that idea into Dimensions by having you rebuild the Speedster car into the Blue Typhoon hovercraft. It&rsquo;s an ok model and the re-use of parts to build this one is fairly ingenious in certain respects, however the large car elements re-used does tend to limit the way you can actually make this model look good while still working as what it was designed to.</span></span></span></span></p>

And it&rsquo;s a fun little extra if you want to have a vehicle for Eggman to fight.</span></span></span></span></p>

It does look like a crab, but it doesn&rsquo;t look anything like what Crabmeat is supposed to look like in-game. (Here or in Sonic&rsquo;s regular games.) The claws aren&rsquo;t big enough, the model is too tall rather than squat and low to the ground like an actual crab should be, and the parts re-use is rather unfortunate. I suppose since the parts need to be used to make two other vehicles this is to be expected, but I hope if they ever re-visit Sonic in LEGO form for some kind of limited run D2C set or something they make much better buildable Badnicks.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Speedster is a faithful looking representation of Sonic&rsquo;s race car, the Typhoon works well as a hover craft although the profile of the model is a bit odd due to the re-used elements in the build.</span></span></span></span></p>

The only downside is the need to stick the car&rsquo;s wheels somewhere, a Motobug doesn&rsquo;t have wheels, plural, it has one large central wheel under the beetle like shell that rolls it around. Because this is a three-in-one model they can&rsquo;t make it this way otherwise you&rsquo;d have spare parts left off the model when attached to the toy tag. Still it&rsquo;d be nice to see LEGO tackle some Sonic sets, just to see what could be done without the need to re-use bits in 3-in-1 builds.</span></span></span></span></p>

But honestly if you&rsquo;re a fan of Sonic this LEGO version shows off a lot of the charm and fun of those games in Dimensions.</span></span></span></span></p>

Honestly I still never ventured into the Battle Arenas because I am a solo player and don&rsquo;t have many options for multiplayer. Still this aspect of Series 2 is a nice addition and adds more play value to the game.</span></span></span></span></p>

A character trait Sonic is well known for in most modern era games. You can do tricks and gain points, but mostly it&rsquo;s used in this game for the Sonic Races. And boy are those things annoying.</span></span></span></span></p>

As the Blue Typhoon you can activate Flight Docks and use Flight Cargo Hooks, has Sonar Smash, Tow-Bar and Sails on water. And once you turn it into a Motobug you can Dig, Super Jump and use Vine Cut.</span></span></span></span></p>

Crabmeat in-game can Jump, Super Jump, Destroy Gold LEGO Objects and has the Guardian Ability. The Egg Catcher shares all of the abilities of The Tornado but also gains the Electricity Switches ability since it can shoot lightning.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set is a must have to complete LEGO Dimensions 200%, though the game still just says 100%. However if you aren&rsquo;t interested in playing LEGO Dimensions as a game, I would still say that if you want a Sonic Minifigure you&rsquo;re going to want this set. The models are also very impressive in this set despite some weaknesses in the Badnick designs.</span></span></span></span></p>

For the most part. Sonic Races are a frustrating irritation caused mainly by faulty camera controls when Sonic is racing, you&rsquo;ll find the camera zipping all over the place screwing up your directional controls which makes running at Sonic speeds in this game extremely irritating. But still well worth the price of admission. So. Strongly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Build Isn&#39;t The Best,And I Do Like The New Molds. But There Is No Playability You Can Only Have Playability If You Have Dimensions. But The Value Is AWFUL. 101 Pieces For $30 Is SOOOOOOOOOOOO Overpriced.</p>
