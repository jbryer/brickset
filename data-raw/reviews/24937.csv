I have watched numerous episodes, but I did not follow it regularly. So I am not the best judge of how accurate this is to the source material, however I shall attempt to explain this set as best as I can with my limited knowledge of the series.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Package: This shows off imagery of The Land of Oo and it&rsquo;s very nicely done. I like the artwork on this uniform packaging because it demonstrates very nice combination of LEGO and these wonderful IP properties.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: A really simple manual design continues to plague these sets. Understandable because LEGO and TT want you to access the models by playing the actual game, however I feel by this point with Series 2 it might have been nice to at least include the first model build of each set in the manuals.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Some nice parts in this set, including a printed element for Jake&rsquo;s builds which is an intriguing idea. I also really like the colour choices in this set with white, pink and yellow used to perfect effect.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

He does however come with dual-molded legs, dual-molded arms, a new head piece for his unique style of head gear, two different character specific facial expressions, a golden sword and a green backpack. He is a solid representation of the character in Minifigure form and an excellent addition to your LEGO Dimensions Collection.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ancient War Elephant: The packaging refers to this model simply as that, but the game adds the rest of the official name of this model. The build here is extremely impressive, it uses some great elements to make the model look pretty faithful to the animated version. It&rsquo;s a great model and the build is highly satisfying.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Cosmic Squid: This model is just an odd build, it works as a model, but looks very strange and I think that&rsquo;s the entire point. I do not know if this thing is actually in the show, but the re-use of parts to make this oddball quirky model just works. The build is strongly satisfying.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Psychic Submarine: I feel this one is the weakest of the three models. Which isn&rsquo;t saying much because it&rsquo;s still great fun to build and has a very unusual look to the finished product. It is a great build, but as we will see this third form once complete doesn&rsquo;t quite match up to its in-game parts use.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Jakemobile: This model is unique, in that it represents a character we also have in Minifigure form being built into a new form using bricks and printed elements. This build is really fun, though it only uses two wheels instead of four for the model. The parts use however is really impressive.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Snail Dude Jake: This model works as an alternate build of the previous model. It adds some nice ideas to turn a car into a snail, which represents the ability of the character to turn into alternative objects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Hover Jake: This model takes the parts and makes a third form for Jake as a &lsquo;vehicle&rsquo; which works great. This build is just as satisfying as the two previous builds. Unlike other sets this 3-in-1 model idea works very well and I&rsquo;m very torn as to which model I want to build and keep on display with my collection.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ancient War Elephant &amp; Alternate Models: All three of these models use the base parts to the best of their abilities and while the main model of the APTWE and the Cosmic Squid match their in-game counterparts quite well and are all kinds of fun, the Submarine model is a bit weaker, in-game there are certain key differences to the model used because digitally they do not need to be restricted to the parts that only come with the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This hinders them a little because with the Submarine model you are missing the two claws on the ends of the elongated manipulator arms and the cockpit area looks much different. Unfortunate, but not un-common with the 3-in-1 aspect of these Dimensions sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Jakemobile &amp; Alternate Models: This trio of models in comparison works very well. Each one serves as a type of vehicle form, the Jakemobile drives around on two wheels, and it still looks solid despite not being a four-wheeled vehicle model. The Snail Dude is almost exactly identical to the in-game model, the only difference being the cheese slopes in-place of actual eyeball elements for the snail&rsquo;s eyes. And the hovercraft form is pure brilliance in the re-use of elements to make a third completely new model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">All three of them are so good I would recommend picking up spare parts to make all three on the secondary market so you can keep all three on display next to Jake the Dog Minifigure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The Digital Content</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

It&rsquo;s very well done, the puzzles are solid, the character abilities work great to achieve what you want and the level itself is fairly well done. I do not recall any difficult moments or bad game breaking glitches while exploring this level.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Adventure World: The Land of Oo is vast and this world includes a lot of nods for fans of the show. There are a lot of characters who appear here with the voices from the series reprising their roles. Some of the puzzles can get a bit repetitive, but overall this is a great looking adventure world.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Battle Arena: Adventure Time Pillow World is the Multiplayer environment you get to explore with this Level Pack. You can take four of your favorites and duke it out here with friends and family.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Finn the Human has an extensive array of abilities. He has the Acrobat, Laser, Target, Laser Deflector, Sword Switch, Cursed Red LEGO Object Destruction, Grapple and Vine Cut abilities as he pulls the tools he needs out of his backpack to access them. One of these abilities is unlocked after you find and solve a quest or puzzle in the Adventure World. I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ve forgotten which one it was as it has been a line since I played the game.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Ancient War Elephant can Hover, Destroy Gold LEGO Objects and has the Guardian Ability. The Cosmic Squid is a flying vehicle and can access Flight Docks and Flight Cargo Hooks has a Tow-Bar ability and can use Water Spray. The Submarine is still able to Destroy Gold LEGO Objects and now has the ability to interact with Underwater Interaction spots and has the Underwater Drone ability.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Jakemobile can talk and has lines that he uses in-game whenever someone drives him. Jake can talk to himself when you bring the Team Pack Minifigure into the game. His abilities include the Tow-Bar, Accelerator Switch and Guardian Ability skills. The Snail Dude model can use Sonar Smash has the Super Jump and Guardian Ability skills and can now destroy Cracked LEGO Objects. His final build can travel on water, use Tow-Bar still and also includes the Water Spray ability for those types of puzzles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Of all these abilities I find Sword Switch to be the most problematic. In theory it should just be a simple power accessing the new Sword Switches to push and/or pull to solve puzzles or unlock doors. In practice it is a horrible mess of an ability with game breaking glitches in certain levels where you will lock your character in place and won&rsquo;t be able to move or solve the puzzle. I had to re-start a level three or four times because Finn would get locked up and I was incapable of switching out or solving the puzzle just to progress in the game.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I&rsquo;m all for bringing in new abilities, but I would appreciate more if the developers had tested their games better before oking the use of such powers in the game.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Fans of Adventure Time are going to want to pick up this Level Pack. Regardless of my thoughts on the matter, if they want to play and interact in the Land of Oo then they are going to buy this or have bought it already. As a casual viewer who did not stick with the series until its&rsquo; end I do find this addition to the game to be fairly impressive. It introduces the characters and concepts of the world in a simple fun way and will probably lead to many new people wanting to watch the series more.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As far as the game mechanics themselves, there are some nice ideas here, but as I noted above one of the character abilities for Finn can be broken at times and cause frustration and headaches. And this game is no longer receiving patch data, so it is, sad to say, going to remain the broken glitch-riddled mess that it is.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Overall I&rsquo;d still recommend this item for your LEGO Dimensions game, but I caution you to be aware that, the larger the game has become the worse the typical TT LEGO Game glitches have become. Working around them will take patience and young gamers should be aware that if their game isn&rsquo;t working 100% of the time this is because of so much content packed into a single title.</span></span></span></span></p>
