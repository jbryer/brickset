Alas it is the only one featuring any levels, Harry Potter is represented by three characters, a Team Pack and a Fun Pack. This unlocks a new Adventure World, but sadly we do not get to re-visit any iconic moments in the franchise for a new level. Still though this is a nice pack.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The standard Team Pack packaging is used to great effect, the images on the front show a nighttime profile of Hogwarts Castle while the two iconic enemies face off in what could be their final duel. The back shows a lovely image of the Adventure World, giving you a sense of what to expect.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Here we find a lot of red and blue elements with black and red thrown in for good measure. I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever mentioned this before, but the extent of most parts in most packs from LEGO Dimensions are small 2x4 or 1x2 or even 1x4 bricks, plates, tiles, single studs and 1x1 plates with clips on the end or bars and other smaller elements found commonly in sets. Unique elements specific to certain creatures or vehicle builds can be found, but for the most part it&rsquo;s all fairly common. But still useful for MOC enthusiasts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Harry Potter: Dressed in his Gryffindor Uniform, Harry shares printing with some past Minifigures though I believe the detail has been improved slightly since the older details seen in 2010 when Harry Potter was last revived. He has a messy hair sculpt which I believe was first introduced in said 2010 re-launch and his Toy Tag features the Gryffindor colours with a lightning symbol and the lion banner. Harry looks great, this Team Pack does not feature the new wand element though, but with so many spares you can replace it if you so choose.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Lord Voldemort: This entire figure is a re-release of the one found in the smallest set from 2011 or 2010, the one which I reviewed previously since it was one of the only ones I had. It included Hagrid, Narcissa and Voldemort. The printing and details on this figure are identical to that set so the only unique element for this figure is the Toy Tag with its Ouroboros inspired Nagini print. A nice re-release, but nothing stands out as unique.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Enchanted Car: The initial build for Harry&rsquo;s vehicle is the Weasley family car, enchanted of course by Arthur Weasley and first seen in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. This model gives us a very nice little build to show off the design of the vehicle in question.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Shark Sub: When you take the car apart you can build this mish-mash looking thing that is decidedly not a shark. It doesn&rsquo;t even look like the profile of a shark, but the build is easy enough to follow along with on the screen.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Monstrous Mouth: This final model you can build out of an enchanted car turns the vehicle into a giant monstrous beast. Possibly a nod to the Monster Book of Monsters&hellip; but the model is a bit eh. It&rsquo;s interesting as you build it, but once you see the finished product you might question why such a thing needed to exist.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Hogwarts Express: This is one of the best models in the entire series. It looks great next to Doc Brown&rsquo;s Time Train also. With a very simple amount of parts you can build this fun little model, and the build was my favorite out of the entire set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Steam Warrior: A giant robot is what you&rsquo;re building here, though giant is misleading as the parts to use are sadly minimal in nature. The build is interesting I&rsquo;ll grant you, but a tad underwhelming while you work on it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Soaring Steam Plane: In keeping with another train build you can rebuild Hogwarts&rsquo; Express into a flying machine. A very weakly designed and implemented flying machine, the stubby nubby wings look terrible and this build is just not as engaging as some of the others.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Enchanted Car &amp; Alternate Builds: As I noted above the car is great, the shark sub suffers from lacking any kind of dorsal fin or really anything that makes it look even remotely like a shark. It&rsquo;s more like one of those Muppet Aliens from Sesame Street that always spoke so oddly and had huge gaping mouths that flapped open and close constantly.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The third model is a bit more interesting, but still has some questionable design choices due to the nature of having to use all of the parts of the car in the build. The wheels in particular are just too obvious and don&rsquo;t really look like anything else than car tires stuck acting as very circular eyebrows.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Hogwarts Express &amp; Alternate Builds: Hogwarts Express is perfect, this is the best of the three models associated with Lord Voldemort. The colours work well together and it&rsquo;s nice to have a miniature version of the Express train. The Steam Warrior just looks goofy, it doesn&rsquo;t match the in-game model at all, some parts are clearly missing and others have been substituted from the train build to try and match what the designers wanted. I&rsquo;d say the in-game version is much better than what you have physically, and maybe trying to MOC a version of that model would look better.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Soaring Steam Plane is just bad, the &lsquo;wings&rsquo; are too short, the propeller is ugly and again the in-game model makes this look much better than what you get physically. A true shame because the ideas behind these alternate models are interesting, the execution could use a bit more work though.</span></span></span></span></p>
