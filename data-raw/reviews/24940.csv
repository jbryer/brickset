Case in point they went for the license to make MI, the MI based on the feature film reboot and not the original television series. Granted Mission Impossible is still highly popular with a lot of people, but it is fairly action focused and a bit more adult in nature due to the source material. Still this is a Level Pack that brings Ethan Hunt into the Minifigure realm.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The artwork on the front of the packaging shows off one of the most iconic scenes in Movie History with Ethan Hunt dangling on a zipline to crack into a computer. Other smaller scenes sprinkle the package all around and of course the Adventure World is shown on the back. Overall a very decent presentation for the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s still got a fun selection of parts to make the vehicle builds and the Toy Tags are highly collectible even if you don&rsquo;t play the game because they make decent little figure and model stands.</span></span></span></span></p>

He&rsquo;s got dual-molded arms for the short-sleeved look and is dressed in his iconic outfit from the scene in the first film when he was dangling over the floor to hack the computer. He also features dual-sided facial printing, one side with him wearing the glasses and head set, the other a plain stoic expression as he prepares to do something exciting, I&rsquo;m sure.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s also pretty quick and works well as far as parts use goes.</span></span></span></span></p>

It is an awkward design though after you&rsquo;ve built it, it looks very odd to see the digital model being ridden in-game.</span></span></span></span></p>

It uses the wheel rim parts for an odd design choice, but it is still a fun build and rather impressive.</span></span></span></span></p>

They are rather quirky in that respect because the Minifigure looks odd when it grips the handles, but all three models are fun to remove from the Toy Tag and play with them.</span></span></span></span></p>

The IMF Tank is curious and quirky and can smash through barriers, in your imagination mind you, the IMF-Splorer is just odd, but in a good way. Underwater vehicles are always curious.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a lengthy adventure and the level did not have any glitches or game breaking moments, which is nice, the puzzles were all solvable without much difficulty and everything just works.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Level was great, but the Adventure World is even better. You get to explore a vast area of European cities and solve quests and other play elements. Didn&rsquo;t run into any glitches while playing here either, which is great, it&rsquo;s always nice when levels and adventure worlds work as intended.</span></span></span></span></p>

I don&rsquo;t think I ever even visited this one while playing solo. I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s a great level to explore and play in, as long as there aren&rsquo;t any game breaking glitches.</span></span></span></span></p>

He has Acrobat, Target, Stealth, X-Ray Vision and Technology abilities and introduces a few new ones. The Fuse Box ability is iconic as you must get through a maze before the stick of dynamite&rsquo;s fuse explodes, it&rsquo;s really impressive and plays the MI theme song every time. MagnoGloves allow you to grip items or interact with magnetic grapple points. In order to Destroy Silver LEGO Objects you get to use the famous stick of gum explosive, a tiny IMF drone will help you solve Drone Mazes and he can Dive as well. The Grapple ability is also there and Scan Disguise allows you to scan another character to access restricted areas while disguised.</span></span></span></span></p>

The ShockCycle let&rsquo;s you do all of the above while gaining the power to Destroy Silver LEGO Objects and has a Special Weapon. The third and final build, IMF Covert jet is a flying and underwater vehicle, as such you can interact with Flight Docks, Flight Cargo Hooks, Underwater Interactions, the Tow-Bar and retains the Special Weapon ability.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I was a bit uncertain what to expect from this, but I find it to be one of my favorite packs from Series 2, it&rsquo;s on my top five list for sure. The music cues, the clips of Tom Cruise, everything is just really impressive. I&rsquo;d strongly recommend picking this one up, I mean how often are we going to get Tom Cruise as a Minifigure?</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The models are great fun too and they enhance the digital content quite well. I think the only downside is that we couldn&rsquo;t get a full Story Pack for this Theme to explore the entire franchise. It&rsquo;d be nice to play condensed versions of all six movies&hellip;provided there were six movies to pull from, but I digress. Strongly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
