And what a Fun Pack. This set is based on an iconic 1980&rsquo;s television show and is almost perfect, I say almost mostly because of one huge problem that a lot of people reported on this to this day. But we&rsquo;ll get to that when we discuss the Digital Content.</span></span></span></span></p>

The A-Team Van is on the front too with the Adventure World visible on the back this Fun Pack is pretty much the same package design we&rsquo;ve seen over and over again and it works so well. I love seeing all of the boxes in my collection, I actually am keeping them all because I enjoy the design and uniform look they provide when on display.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s actually pretty decent for a set this size.</span></span></span></span></p>

He is also sporting a nice Mohawk hair style, at least a Mohawk in style, it doesn&rsquo;t stick up as high as a Mohawk should, but the style is still referred to as such if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. His torso has a nice detailed print loaded with gold chain necklaces, a staple of Mr. T and his character on The A-Team. He&rsquo;s a great looking Minifigure and one of the huge draws for fans of the show.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">B.A.&rsquo;s Van: This is a great build and I enjoyed it immensely. The model just looks great and building it is so much fun.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Fool Smasher: This is a quirky re-build and looks pretty impressive. Taking the sides of the van and moving them down to cover the back tires changes the entire profile and the rest of the build is pretty solid for what you get.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Pain Plane: This build is very well executed and a really clever design. There&rsquo;s really not much more to say, easy to build, fun to play with once finished, that&rsquo;s what you want from models at this scale.</span></span></span></span></p>

It helps that they all share the same colour scheme which complements the designs quite nicely.</span></span></span></span></p>

This Fun Pack has been broken almost since the first patch which featured it, the True Jedi meter, or whatever they called it in this game with the yellow progress bar would always act as if you had not yet collected enough studs to get the Gold Brick for that achievement.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This glitch isn&rsquo;t the only one either, it was a pain because even after being downloaded it would say you hadn&rsquo;t downloaded it yet and the message would pop up saying you had to download from PSN. Eventually they managed to patch this, but the fact that this was a problem for so long hinders what would otherwise be a great Adventure World to explore.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Even now some problems persist. I really hate this because this is one of the better Adventure Worlds from Series 2 and could have been great.</span></span></span></span></p>

I am unaware of any glitches present here, but then again I never really explored all of these Battle Arenas.</span></span></span></span></p>

He introduces a new ability too, the A-Team Master Build, which works similar to the Master Builder ability, but is something only B.A can do. Last, but certainly not least, is the unique I ain&rsquo;t getting&rsquo; on no plane! Ability, which is a clever nod to the character&rsquo;s fear of heights, whenever he&rsquo;s flying on a plane or other flight vehicle he will be sleeping. Because it was the only way to get him on a plane in the show.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Fool Smasher can Destroy Silver LEGO Objects on top of having the Accelerator Switches ability and can also Destroy Cracked LEGO Objects while possessing a Special Attack. The Pain Plane is a Flying vehicle able to interact with Flight Docks and Flight Cargo Hooks, but is based on a Cargo Plane capable of landing and sailing on the water. It also has a Special Attack.</span></span></span></span></p>

Because of this I find I must half-heartedly recommend getting the physical stuff, but, unless you really want to play all of LEGO Dimensions, just skip the Toy Tags on this one. Mildly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
